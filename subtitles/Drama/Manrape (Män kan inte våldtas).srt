<i>This is the confession tree. </i>

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,500
<i>Buy a shell comb</i>

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,270
<i>and give it to the person you like.</i>

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,700
<i> Accept my feelings. </i>

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,900
<i> I can't. </i>

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,590
<i> It's not that she doesn't have feelings toward you. </i>

7
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,740
<i>But she keeps saying that she doesn't want to date.</i>

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,810
<i>What you have to do now is find a way to make sure she can't hide.</i>

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,570
<i>If you really don't want to date, you should try it with me first.</i>

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,580
<i>I already have someone I want to try it with.</i>

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,980
<i> Who? </i>

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,600
<i> Him! </i>

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,860
<i>Then let's try it out.</i>

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,970
<i> Your grandpa is fine! </i>

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,260
<i>I was the passerby who sent your grandpa to the hospital.</i>

16
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,400
<i>Now you owe me.</i>

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,380
<i> Congratulations on you and Director Xia! </i>

18
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,010
<i>How do they know already? </i>

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,370
<i>Sorry, Unibrow.</i>

20
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,620
<i> Goodbye. </i>

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,580
<i> My birthday is April 1st. </i>

22
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,410
<i> Like my whole existence is a great big joke. </i>

23
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,610
<i>My birthday is January 8th. </i>

24
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,330
<i> You just need to remember that. </i>

25
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,390
<i>It means "start" in German.</i>

26
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,670
<i> Look at mine! </i>

27
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,020
<i>It looks like our hearts are connected.</i>

28
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,110
<i> We won't break up! </i>

29

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,110
Okay.

55
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,050
You...

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,160
There's something that I can't put into words.

57
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,590
I think I've seen this before!

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,780
Forget it.

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,780
I don't want to remember the guy who wore glasses.

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,630
Wearing glasses covers up your sharp eyes.

61
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,860
It seems like it's not time to tell her yet.

62
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,550
Why did Yan Ze say that you two should have met 10 years ago?

63
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,110
Have you been thinking about this all day?

64
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,640
What do you think?

65
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,630
Remember how I told you that all the presents that I had sent to my mom were all returned to me?

66
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,110
The person who returned them to me turned out to be Yan Ze.

67
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,810
Yan Ze?

68
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,700
So when you came to my room and took that envelope...

69
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,950
It was to make sure that it was Yan Ze that did it.

70
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,450
At that time, Yan Ze's dad passed away.

71
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,850
When he was organizing his father's matters, he noticed that

72
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,430
there was no room for my presents, so

73
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,920
he just returned them all to the sender.

74
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,980
Wasn't Yan Ze's dad a doctor?

75
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,020
Yeah.

76
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,350
His dad was a volunteer for the Asian Childcare Association.

77
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,120
At that time, I thought that my mom also worked there.

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,850
So I would send birthday gifts there every year.

79
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,760
In the end, I found out that she wasn't some great volunteer.

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,600
She was just a mom who didn't want me.

81
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,430
Wow! Holding hands!

82
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,930
Holding hands!

83
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,830
Hey. How far did you guys get today?

84
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,260
Okay, stop asking guys.

85
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,630
If we keep asking, An Xi will dig a hole and hide herself!

86
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,620
Oh, poor Yan Ze!

87
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,910
Come on, it's okay.

88
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,160
Zhi Lin will comfort you, okay?

89
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,440
An Xi. I've known you for so long

90
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,080
but I only just found out that you can make men feel broken-hearted

91
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,040
and are a girl filled with charms.

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,670
What are you talking about?

93
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,300
What are they doing?

94
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,630
Do you want to go find out?

95
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,530
No!

96
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,780
Let's go.

97
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,670
1, 2, 3!

98
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,750
Congratulations!

99
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,110
This is a gift from me to a friend whom I have not met in ten years.

100
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,030
Face your heart, and don't miss out on the person you like.

101
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,950
We all know how it feels to wait regrettably.

102
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,940
Oh, you guys!

103
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,870
Give me a hug!

104
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,480
Quickly spread your love luck to me!

105
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,850
Come here!

106
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,660
Hey, me too!

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,440
You!

108
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,220
You knew it all along but you didn't tell me.

109
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,130
Only people like you would be tricked twice.

110
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,920
When was I tricked twice?

111
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,730
If you thought about it in the afternoon,

112
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,180
you would know that everyone was in cahoots this morning.

113
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,880
When you came back, you wouldn't feel startled.

114
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,950
Your brain really has no folds.

115
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,920
Hey!

116
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,810
You Sly Idiot!

117
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,780
Director Xia!

118
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,900
Wait a second.

119
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,020
I thought you already changed your target to Mr. Hu?

120
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,630
I knew Director Xia for a longer period.

121
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,770
Now he's become my ex-boyfriend.

122
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,690
Ya Lu!

123
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,080
Ya Lu, don't spoil her.

124
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,860
Okay.

125
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,580
Okay, stop whining!

126
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,670
It's getting late.

127
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,970
Let the guests return to their rooms and rest.

128
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,230
<i> Have you thought about what to do next?</i>

129
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,390
<i> Don't worry. </i>

130
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,470
<i> This afternoon, I already researched it. </i>

131
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,570
<i>I also finished planning my schedule.</i>

132
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,550
An Xi.

133
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,390
Huh?

134
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,400
Are you going up?

135
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,960
Yeah.

136
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,450
<i>The first step: don't find this a hassle after dating.</i>

137
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,130
<i>One must see the girl to her doorstep. </i>

138
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,700
<i>Say goodnight to her affectionately</i>

139
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,900
<i>and leave behind a wonderful prior expectation for the next romantic date.</i>

140
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,690
Everyone has their own forest ahead of them.

141
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,670
We have never been there

142
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,010
but it's always there.

143
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,150
Always there.

144
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,480
The people who are off the tracks are lost

145
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,380
while the people who are meant to be will meet again.

146
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,940
I...

147
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,760
am eagerly looking forward to it.

148
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,350
You Qian.

149
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,040
I'm completely lost in your eyes.

150
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,580
An Xi. I'll take you up—

151
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,310
An Xi, you aren't going to sleep yet, right?

152
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,280
Of course not!

153
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Of course we have to talk about what the both of you did today.

154
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,160
Me too, me too!

155
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,820
Give it to me!

156
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,060
Then let's have a girls' pajama party today!

157
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,970
Woo!

158
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,630
Wait! I want to do it too.

159
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,560
No problem!

160
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,570
Come on!

161
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,510
Lunar Maria's pajama party!

162
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,560
Lunar Maria's pajama party!

163
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,570
Lunar Maria's pajama party!

164
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,060
<i>The second step: a warm morning greeting</i>

165
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,170
<i>can give a good start to a beautiful day.</i>

166
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,290
<i>Putting breakfast on the table. It will be best if the breakfast is handmade.</i>

167
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,790
Good morning.

168
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,820
Good morning.

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,640
Here.

170
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,460
Try it.

171
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,910
So sweet!

172
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,110
You Qian?

173
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,040
What are you doing?

174
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,790
Wow!

175
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,620
You already prepared breakfast?

176
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,800
You're so capable!

177
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,100
Hey, Mei Wen!

178
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,670
You Qian prepared breakfast for us!

179
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,580
Come down quickly!

180
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,060
- An Xi! <br> - Tell Zhi Lin, Ya En, and Ya Lu to come down too!

181
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,240
Wow, I couldn't tell that you were so capable.

182
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,980
There are also my favorite corn flakes!

183
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,370
Wow!

184
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,550
It's so grand!

185
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,350
You're only a little worse than me!

186
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,960
What? There's even soup?

187
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,510
This is so remarkable!

188
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,110
Get Yan Ze down to join us.

189
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,180
Okay, I'll go get him.

190
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,080
Mei Wen.

191
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,900
What's this?

192
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,730
Go away.

193
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,630
<i>No problem. </i>

194
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,240
<i>Failure is the mother of success.</i>

195
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,800
<i> There's still the next step. </i>

196
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,840
<i> Send the girl to and from work. </i>

197
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,050
<i>Even if it is a meaningless conversation, we can still increase the warmth in our relationship.</i>

198
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,590
An Xi.

199
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,370
Don't you need to go work today?

200
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,710
Yeah, Ya Lu's school is on the way.

201
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm leaving first, bye!

202
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,880
Let's go!

203
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,020
Don't even say anything.

204
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,710
Wait, your car...

205
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm going to drive it out and have fun!

206
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,170
Whatever you want.

207
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,620
Is that girl just really naive, or is she doing it on purpose?

208
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,630
24 hours in a day.

209
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,460
How much time can I get?

210
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,570
I'm back!

211
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,500
Where's Mei Wen and the rest of them?

212
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,430
Mei Wen?

213
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,910
Probably upstairs drying out the clothes.

214
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,810
Oh.

215
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,510
Oh, right!

216
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,300
Here's a kiwi for you!

217
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,600
Your vision is so bad

218
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,870
yet you still use the computer so often.

219
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,590
Eat more kiwis to improve your vision.

220
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,470
Mei Wen is going to make a fruit salad tonight.

221
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,490
They had a "buy 5 get 1 free" sale for kiwis!

222
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,570
That's the free one you're holding.

223
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,500
Tell me, was it a bargain or luck?

224
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,930
Wait.

225
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,890
Don't you think that something isn't quite right?

226
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,680
What's not right?

227
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,920
Sit down.

228
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,040
Usually, when two people decide to start dating,

229
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,910
no matter what they do, they always think of the other person.

230
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,360
- Okay. <br> - Such as, when they're buying things,

231
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,430
they'll think of what the other person likes to eat.

232
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,880
You don't like kiwis?

233
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,000
Sorry,

234
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,580
I really didn't know.

235
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,020
Then give me back the kiwi.

236
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,610
What I meant was we are a couple.

237
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,430
There will definitely be some conflicts in a relationship.

238
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,830
Yeah.

239
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,600
So they'll spend time with the other person.

240
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,530
Always together for almost 24 hours.

241
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,730
24 hours?

242
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,680
That's too sickening!

243
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,250
Sickening?

244
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,910
Yeah,

245
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,900
if we're together all day and night,

246
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,210
and we see each other all the time,

247
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,370
won't you get sick of it?

248
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,830
An Xi.

249
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,820
We just started dating.

250
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,930
Even so, we don't have to see each other all the time.

251
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,840
We do!

252
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,360
And I wouldn't get bored.

253
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,320
I think it's really beautiful.

254
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,610
I would look all day.

255
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,960
Ardency is indeed a symptom in the early stages of love. <br><i>Ardency means passionate and enthusiastic</i>

256
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,140
No, what ardency?

257
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,500
We are just discussing about how we can use kiwis to become ultraman.

258
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,420
Come, sit.

259
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,630
What were you talking about?

260
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,530
Nothing that has to do with you.

261
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,370
Oh yeah, our hostel's website is ready.

262
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,390
Ya Lu showed it to me today.

263
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,380
Your photographs are really good!

264
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,300
Really?

265
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,200
Yeah! If you don't believe it, I'll show it to you.

266
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,140
You Qian, let me borrow the laptop.

267
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,670
You can't.

268
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,950
It's okay, just come to my room.

269
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,170
I'll use my computer.

270
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,080
You can't!

271
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,380
Just look at it here.

272
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,290
Thanks.

273
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,010
You don't know how touched I felt

274
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,940
when I saw the website this morning!

275
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,830
Having a professional photographer really makes a difference!

276
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,750
Look, look!

277
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,630
You made our hostel look warm and beautiful.

278
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,420
Thank you, Yan Ze.

279
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,340
It was only a small matter.

280
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,990
Look!

281
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,680
I thought our smiles would look terrible.

282
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,720
You're not going to look at it with us, You Qian?

283
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,910
I don't like everybody looking at it together.

284
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,370
You promised me you would work hard.

285
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,300
But hardworking to what extent?

286
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,130
Sorry, I'm not An Xi.

287
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,700
What's wrong? Aren't you in love?

288
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,070
What's the big deal?

289
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,590
She said she would be with me,

290
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,180
but she hasn't acknowledged I've entered her world.

291
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,600
Isn't she the same as before?

292
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,780
Her priorities are at the hostel and friends.

293
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,400
You can't blame An Xi for that.

294
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,120
If you want to blame someone, then blame me for being too attractive.

295
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,850
Do you know why I was with her that night?

296
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,630
Wake up. An Xi already told me.

297
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,760
This stranger that returns gifts.

298
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,160
Hey. It's big brother.

299
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,660
What is up with you siblings?

300
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,990
One likes to be nosy into other people's world and the other likes to pretend to be a nice person.

301
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,310
Knowing that there are some things that you can't attain no matter how hard you work,

302
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,570
Life is better spent living relaxingly.

303
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:54,750
You have to appreciate my personality or else I would've actually chased An Xi.

304
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,240
I could also consider to have known An Xi ten years earlier.

305
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,980
She really is a good girl.

306
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,220
<i> You are like me.</i>

307
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,180
<i> Although you are caring, you still feel lonely. </i>

308
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,390
I purposefully sent back the presents to her.

309
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:33,000
Take it as...a young boy's intent on being bad.

310
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,080
My birth father didn't want me.

311
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,790
So when I saw a girl who missed her mom and sent presents,

312
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:47,130
I decided to return the packages.

313
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,810
I wanted to tell her, "Your mother also doesn't want you."

314
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:01,660
So some day, ten years ago, her dream was shattered.

315
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,540
I still remember her saying that day she threw a big tantrum.

316
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,870
What tantrum?

317
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:22,640
She said that herself. After I apologize to her, she thought of her tantrum.

318
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,660
Ten years ago, wasn't she a high school student?

319
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,570
What kind of tantrum did she throw?

320
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,790
<i>When she was in high school there was an incident where she cut off communications just like this.</i>

321
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,960
<i>I think it was on her birthday. </i>

322
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,270
What day did your father pass away ten years ago?

323
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,390
March 20th. Why?

324
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,640
<i>My birthday is April 1st.</i>

325
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,690
<i>It's like God saying</i>

326
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,060
<i> My birthday is a big joke. </i>

327
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,350
Then when did you send the presents back to An Xi?

328
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,870
I think it was the end of the month?

329
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:01,500
Then could it be the day I confessed was the day An Xi found out her mother would never come back?

330
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,290
So...So she...

331
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,420
Hey! Where are you going?

332
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,870
<i> I heard from Mei Wen that you threw a huge tantrum on your 18th birthday?</i>

333
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,730
<i> I got into an argument with my dad.</i>

334
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,010
<i> So? So you took out your frustrations on innocent bystanders?</i>

335
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,530
<i>Yes. It just so happened there was someone who came to look for me that day. </i>

336
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,390
<i> Then I yelled at him a while. </i>

337
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,380
<i> I always thought she rejected me because she hated me. </i>

338
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,640
<i> I thought she was like other people and played me. </i>

339
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,430
<i> It turns out that day was the worst day in her life. </i>

340
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:45,060
<i> It was I who chose the wrong day to confess. <br>I really can't see people's cues. </i>

341
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,430
An Xi!!

342
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,770
An Xi seems to be in her room.

343
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,360
Hey Director Xia!

344
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,620
Why are you running so fast?

345
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,700
An Xi!

346
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
An Xi

347
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,770
Xia You Qian. You Qian

348
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,690
are you looking for An Xi?

349
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,930
She's feeding the geese in the back. Can you hear it?

350
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,550
Feeding geese?

351
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,200
Hey.

352
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:44,610
Tell me. Eating together, isn't it a happy thing?

353
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,420
Viewing the webpage together, isn't it a happy thing?

354
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,730
Xia You Qian, you're really not ok.

355
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,450
An Xi!

356
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,690
What?

357
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,200
Sorry.

358
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,140
Why are you saying sorry to me?

359
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,730
Sorry.

360
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,020
Sorry?

361
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,330
Sorry for not accepting my kiwi?

362
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,350
Sorry for not viewing the webpage with me?

363
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,760
Do you still remember the person who confessed to you ten years ago?

364
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,800
Why are you suddenly bringing this up.

365
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,190
Actually...

366
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,320
Actually I am

367
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,460
No way...

368
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,320
Jiang Hai Kuo?

369
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,110
Why are you guys here again?

370
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,140
Don't we have nothing to do with each other anymore?

371
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,410
Future sister-in-law, why do you have to be so harsh?

372
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,680
He even went up the mountains to seek for the purpose of life.

373
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,790
Excuse me, did he run away?

374
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,300
As if.

375
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,880
He went for plastic surgery?

376
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,000
He's so handsome. Why would he need plastic surgery?

377
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,840
will be appearing in front of you.

378
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,750
♫ <i>Yeah... danger, danger</i> ♫

379
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:32,240
An Du Du, long time no see. How do you do? Hello!

380
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,480
Jiang Hai Kuo.

381
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,850
What are you wearing?

382
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,130
Handsome, right?

383
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,130
Big Brother, calm down.

384
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,190
Big Brother, peace. Peace.

385
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,920
What does that mean?

386
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,680
It means peace.

387
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,180
Lately, I've chosen this book.

388
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,580
Who is that?

389
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,090
Sly idiot!

390
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,640
Why are you here?

391
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,980
Big Brother, calm down.

392
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,900
I want to ask you,

393
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,230
why are you here?

394
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:59,100
So you shouldn't be here.

395
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,940
Of course Director Xia should be here.

396
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,250
Because he is An Xi's boyfriend.

397
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,980
He...is your boyfriend?

398
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,090
That's right.

399
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,840
He...is your boyfriend?

400
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,810
That's right!

401
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,390
Why?!

402
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,770
I only left for a short while and you made me a cuckold!

403
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,700
Aren't you moving too fast?

404
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,120
Excuse me. This isn't about moving too fast or too slow.

405
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,510
It's about fate.

406
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,890
Why?

407
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,750
Are you stupid?!

408
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,310
You think he's handsome, right? Is he as handsome as me?

409
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,720
What else then?

410
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,910
Why did you copy him? Why did you wear the same thing as him?

411
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,360
Let me tell you.

412
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,060
So what?

413
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,930
I will do it by force then!

414
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,600
Let's go.

415
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,910
Let me go!

416
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,500
Let me warn you. If I ever see you touch An Xi,

417
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,940
Go away!

418
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,660
Big Brother, the sly idiot just stopped you.

419
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,260
Shut up!

420
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,240
An Du Du, don't forget. You still owe me something.

421
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,330
I still have the thing you want most in my possession.

422
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,960
Are you hurt?

423
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,430
No.

424
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,490
Are you okay?

425
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,420
I'm fine.

426
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,190
Hey.

427
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,100
Yan Ze, you have no idea what you missed out earlier on.

428
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,420
Just then, Director Xia was really handsome. He easily - bam! blocked someone.

429
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,320
Blocked someone...

430
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:53,020
An Xi. Do you really only like me because of my appearances?

431
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,160
You are really handsome.

432
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:06,100
What if I was really ugly? Would you still like me?

433
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,020
Why are you asking this?

434
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,940
Don't tell me you don't have confidence.

435
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,650
Don't worry! You are really handsome.

436
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,710
Really handsome.

437
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:28,290
Oh right! What were you going to tell me earlier?

438
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,880
I forgot.

439
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,870
Oh. Then let's go.

440
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,360
<i> If you knew that I was Unibrow, </i>

441
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,950
<i> would you still like me? </i>

442
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,220
♫ <i>to say that I love you</i> ♫

443
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:07,050
♫ <i>Lightning strikes without a warning. It approaches in just one second</i> ♫

444
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,930
♫ <i>Without a warning. My heart beats violently</i> ♫

445
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,130
♫ <i>I acknowledge your good points</i> ♫

446
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,000
Stop the car.

447
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,800
Stop the car.

448
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,350
Stop the car! Are you deaf?!

449
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,120
Alright, boss.

450
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,950
- Boss. <br>- What am I wearing?

451
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,260
It's so tight!

452
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,120
- So tight! Hands off!<br>- Boss, I'll help you.

453
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,040
No need! So tight! Tacky!

454
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,630
Take it!

455
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,020
What does Xia You Qian wear this kind of clothes for? Ugly people always find troubles.

456
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,840
- Does he think he's the MC for temple fare?<br>- Right!

457
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,850
Hey, b-b-boss!

458
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,250
I wanted to ask you.

459
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,480
Just now at the hostel, you mentioned that An Xi still owes you something?

460
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,120
She doesn't owe me.

461
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,260
I'm the one that owes her.

462
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,730
But, the thing that she wants is indeed on my hands.

463
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,610
An Du Du.

464
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,140
We're not yet done.

465
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,660
What is good about him?

466
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,760
Why is it him?

467
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,140
Why?

468
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:01,160
Honestly, his looks do add some points.

469
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,210
But when I first met him,

470
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,080
he was really annoying.

471
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,920
Even if he's super handsome, I won't be with him at all.

472
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,260
Little Bookworm, you say...

473
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,380
What is so special about him?

474
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,980
Or, is it because he's a good person that helped me before?

475
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,980
But why does my heart beat for a good person?

476
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:30,110
Glasses Boy, you say why did I date him?

477
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,800
Or is it because...

478
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,910
He has a pair of eyes that resemble "his" eyes?

479
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,000
He also has a lonely back view like him.

480
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,830
So when people see him,

481
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,680
they will want to get close to him and accompany him?

482
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,970
Why are they so smart but yet, they're unable to trust people?

483
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,750
Little Green, you say...

484
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,030
Did I get together with a strange person?

485
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,040
<i>I know that, that year, when you turned 18 years old, you weren't directing your tantrum at me personally.</i>

486
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,460
<i>But, I really can't see through what are you thinking.</i>

487
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,310
You Qian? Why were you keeping quiet even though you came in?

488
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,850
Do you want to work? I just came to feed the fishes.

489
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,010
I can leave immediately.

490
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,800
Give me some confidence.

491
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,550
I hope that this cold of mine will never get well.

492
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,530
Did you get a cold? Let me see.

493
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,360
I really want to...

494
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,940
continue this path with you.

495
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,050
The fourth step...

496
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,960
As expected, there's no use in this.

497
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,000
Xia You Qian! An Xi brought Ya En to the hospital for further checkup.

498
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,440
- To Taipei?<br>- Right.

499
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,900
You-You're not eating breakfast?

500
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,700
I'm not hungry. Thank you.

501
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,580
<i>Perfect Lover - Step by Step.</i>

502
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,870
What's the use of searching up those things?

503
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:41,200
No matter how many things you plan, it'll all end up as strike lines.

504
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,050
Put it down.

505
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:53,240
Why did you happen to like a girl that values "one for all, all for one"?

506
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,220
Why don't you advise her to be more selfish and think more for herself?

507
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,920
That's An Xi's good point.

508
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,450
Since you can't change her personality,

509
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:08,250
then try to change her environment.

510
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,880
Xia You Qian. I really don't want to laugh at you.

511
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,460
But when it's about this girl, your eyes became totally blind.

512
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,500
You follow her wish in everything.

513
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,730
Didn't you realize that the biggest problem between you two is that there's too many people surrounding you guys?

514
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,610
It's about time for you to return to Taipei, right?

515
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,120
Right. There's not many days left to my annual leave.

516
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,100
Remember, a good trick is not afraid to be reused again and again.

517
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,930
-That's great, Ya En! You've to keep up this condition.<br>- Right.

518
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,470
What bring you guys here?

519
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,960
Did you came to fetch us?

520
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,840
Right. I'm here to fetch you.

521
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,720
As for An Xi... Mr. Xia wants to take her to another place.

522
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,010
Where do we go?

523
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,050
- You'll know it once we go.<br>- Hey!

524
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,600
- My hostel...!<br>- There's Mei Wen.

525
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,500
- I still have to do part-time job.<br>- Zhi Lin will do it for you.

526
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,250
- Ya En!<br>- She has a brother.

527
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,950
- But I—<br>- Already have a boyfriend.

528
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,030
Shouldn't you spend more time taking care of your boyfriend?

529
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,180
- But...<br>- As the person in charge of the hostel,

530
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,850
shouldn't you spend more time taking care of the creditor that's being left aside by his girlfriend?

531
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,140
The creditor's personality isn't that good too.

532
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,230
By then, if he does something...

533
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,200
Creditor, don't be impulsive. Keep calm and communicate slowly.

534
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,920
Alright, I think I'll spend more time to communicate slowly with you.

535
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,550
No problem. My ears are very big. You can say anything you like.

536
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,960
Then, where do you want to go?

537
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,740
- Then, let us leave too.<br>- Hey!

538
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,100
I... Can we go somewhere first?

539
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,310
♫ <i>At times, I'm not very smart</i> ♫

540
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:18,000
♫ <i>I can't find the right timing or the right tone</i> ♫

541
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,410
So this is where you wanted to go?

542
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,640
Yes.

543
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,740
Why?

544
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,050
Everyone in Pulang Village knows how to swim. Only I

545
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,490
have never even been to the beach.

546
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,460
Oh, because of your illness?

547
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,150
Yes.

548
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,100
It's an illness in which I can't handle being provoked in any way.

549
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,750
All it takes is someone setting off fireworks

550
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:12,600
for my brother and An Xi to rush to me and cover my ears.

551
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:21,070
All it takes is a little movement from me for them to have worried expressions on their faces.

552
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,540
So, in order to not make them worry,

553
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,080
you didn't tell them that you wanted to play in the water?

554
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,150
And because I'm a stranger, even if you faint in front of me by chance,

555
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,130
there won't be any feelings of being indebted, and

556
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,720
that way you won't have any psychological burdens?

557
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,780
It's okay.

558
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,070
It's fine if you think that way.

559
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,930
Sometimes, in order to give others a peace of mind,

560
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,180
you always wear a smile on your face.

561
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,570
If not, then it's going out of your way to please others

562
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,950
simply because you feel that you're relying on them in order to live.

563
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,270
You can get tired of living like that for too long, right?

564
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,980
No.

565
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,870
My brother and An Xi are very good to me.

566
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:17,300
This is exactly why I have all the more reason not to make them...

567
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,250
Okay!

568
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,760
Then, I will be your protector for today,

569
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,360
but the one thing you have to do is

570
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,110
to try your best not to faint, okay?

571
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,960
Then, let me see. Where should we start?

572
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,110
Okay, let's start here.

573
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,310
Okay!

574
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,410
Let's go.

575
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,240
How does it feel?

576
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,860
- Ah!<br>- Hey, kids!

577
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,260
Hey. Wait, kids, wait. Wait.

578
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,340
Come on over.

579
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,280
Come here.

580
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,220
Do you guys see this girl?

581
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,690
Let me tell you,

582
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,870
she's actually a magician,

583
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,860
so if your water guns spray at her again,

584
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,580
she'll turn you guys into statues, got it?

585
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,890
Liar!

586
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,950
When did I lie?

587
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,070
I didn't!

588
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,400
Kids these days have really high combat capability.

589
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,780
How can you go back like that?

590
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,630
You should change your clothes first.

591
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,160
Let's go.

592
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,180
Welcome.

593
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,600
Take your time looking.

594
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,310
If you like anything, you can try it on inside.

595
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,220
This one suits you very well.

596
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,120
What do you think?

597
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,260
There's no need.

598
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,700
This will dry in a bit.

599
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,190
Just take it.

600
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,520
I'm the protector today, so it's my call.

601
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,630
Go get changed.

602
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,700
The dressing room is this way.

603
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,170
Thank you.

604
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,670
He's tall and handsome.

605
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:17,640
- Isn't he your type?<br>- He's really hot.

606
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,930
Is it okay?

607
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,560
Yes, thank you.

608
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,430
Not bad.

609
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,520
I have good taste.

610
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,220
Here, please.

611
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,000
If possible, please fill out this form to become a member.

612
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,130
There's no need. Thank you.

613
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,630
We will send you guys the newest catalogs and discounts.

614
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:50,900
If you guys want to increase your membership base, this lady is part of your target audience,

615
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,460
but if you just want my number, I apologize.

616
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,990
I already have a girlfriend.

617
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,100
Please sign the bill.

618
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,730
- Thank you.<br>- Thank you.

619
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,710
Let's go, girlfriend.

620
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,350
Okay, boyfriend.

621
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,420
The way you responded gave it away that we're not actually in a relationship.

622
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,820
Silly.

623
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,590
Alright, I wasn't really saying that you were silly.

624
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,170
I was just joking with you.

625
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,810
Let's go.

626
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,700
Please come in.

627
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,740
Thank you.

628
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,490
Wow.

629
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,510
This is your home?

630
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,200
Of course.

631
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,100
What's the problem?

632
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,770
Nothing. Why are we coming to your house?

633
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:11,760
It's to spend more time together and cultivate our feelings.

634
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,650
We can cultivate our feelings at my hostel too.

635
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,670
I need to go to work,

636
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:21,410
and there isn't even an opportunity to spend time together at the hostel.

637
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,510
Since when was there not?

638
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,720
Okay, okay, okay.

639
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,450
We're only spending time together for a day.

640
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,480
I'll leave tomorrow.

641
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,660
Why?

642
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,180
I didn't even bring a change of clothes.

643
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,350
Sister Mei Wen packed it for you.

644
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,350
Sister Mei Wen?

645
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,930
Exactly how many benefits did you give her?

646
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,770
She's always standing on your side.

647
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,390
She's not standing on my side.

648
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,220
She's doing this for your own good.

649
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,420
That better be the case. I'll call and ask her.

650
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,290
<i>Your call is being transferred to...</i>

651
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:05,050
Isn't she being too much?

652
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,270
Last time she read my message without responding,

653
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,570
and now she won't pick up her phone.

654
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,690
<i>Jin Mei Wen<br>Calling...</i>

655
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,690
Hi, Sister Mei Wen!

656
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,160
You still say you didn't give her benefits?

657
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,810
Jin Mei Wen.

658
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,720
<i>An Xi, I'm sorry. I was busy just now!</i>

659
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,170
You better be!

660
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,290
Yan Ze's the only one at the hostel. What's keeping you busy?

661
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,690
I'm telling the truth!

662
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,760
Hey! It's true, An Xi!

663
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,560
In order to keep us from looking for you,

664
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,220
Director Xia specially invited guests to our hostel.

665
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:41,080
Look, this reservation book has Anderson, Richard, and Henry!

666
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,090
<i>You can tell they're handsome just by hearing their names.</i>

667
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,290
Then, that's all the more reason for me to go back.

668
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,920
<i>There's no need!</i>

669
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,400
Yes, let me tell you, Xia You Qian is right.

670
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,350
Right now, it's enough to have two or three people working at the hostel.

671
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,030
Plus, Ya Lu will be coming over to help. We'll be fine with three people.

672
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,150
<i>Have a good vacation.</i>

673
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,610
<i>Take it easy for a bit.</i>

674
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,740
<i>Also, An Xi, you've taken care of us for such a long time,</i>

675
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,160
<i>so you should let someone else take care of you once in awhile.</i>

676
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,730
<i>Oh, right. Xia You Qian, let me tell you,</i>

677
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,960
An Xi is the type of person who won't stay idle for a moment

678
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,480
if you don't ask her to take a break.

679
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,420
So please have her get some rest

680
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,300
<i>and live a laid-back life, alright?</i>

681
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,780
It's okay. Just stay there for a few more days.

682
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,750
Stay there for another ten days or half a month,

683
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,380
until I find myself a boyfriend.

684
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,940
<i>If you see any fine men around Director Xia,</i>

685
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,540
<i>remember to tell them to come stay at the hostel!</i>

686
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,790
<i>Idiot.</i>

687
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,080
<i>Okay, okay. Let's allow them to cultivate their feelings.</i>

688
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,590
- <i>That's all for now!</i><br>- Hey, wait, wait, wait!

689
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,950
There's no need to wait!

690
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,910
Hey! I didn't even finish talking,

691
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,090
and you hung up the phone!

692
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,330
You still have time to talk on the phone?

693
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:40,020
Your Anderson, Richard, and Henry will be coming tomorrow.

694
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,570
Aren't you going to hurry up and get ready?

695
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:51,730
Anderson, oh, Henry, oh, Richard! I'm coming!

696
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,140
Little idiot.

697
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:01,660
For two people who just started dating, isn't living with each other moving too fast?

698
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,360
I lived at your house for two to three weeks.

699
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,780
My house is a hostel.

700
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,130
How about this?

701
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,220
Let's make a list according to the progress you want and go from there.

702
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,770
That's not it.

703
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:23,180
For couples who just started dating, don't they all begin with holding hands?

704
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,870
Holding hands?

705
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,820
And then?

706
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,780
And then...

707
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,330
Say it.

708
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,170
I'll coordinate with you, however you want it.

709
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:51,070
My expectations of love are extremely simple.

710
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,520
How simple?

711
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,400
Extremely simple.

712
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,830
It's a world shared by two people.

713
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,690
You can do whatever you want.

714
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:04,630
The important thing is that it's you and me, just the two of us.

715
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:42,950
The important thing is that it's you and me, just the two of us.

716
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,080
Grandpa, be careful as you walk in.

717
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,070
Grandpa?

718
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,630
Small rolls girl.

719
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,970
An Xi!

720
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,200
<i>You go back first.</i>

721
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,360
<i>I would like to be alone.</i>

722
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,910
<i>- An Xi... <br>- I'm fine.</i>

723
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,400
<i>Old friend.</i>

724
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,540
<i>I'm here to play the last game of chess with you.</i>

725
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:58,910
<i>It would have been better if I had brought some side dishes.</i>

726
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:02,800
<i>It's your turn.</i>

727
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,160
<i>I'm going to attack all the way without giving any chances.</i>

728
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,980
Excuse me.

729
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,730
Grandpa, I made these rolls myself.

730
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:19,470
<i>If you don't mind, you can take this with your wine.</i>

731
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,190
Hey, we have a side dish to go with the wine.

732
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:45,710
Grandpa. What are you doing here?

733
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,710
Have you been feeling better lately?

734
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,040
I'm much better.

735
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,890
I already felt much better after eating your rolls.

736
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,110
What about you?

737
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:57,120
You don't seem to be in a good mood that day.

738
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,200
My mood has improved a lot

739
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:04,420
but fortunately, because of You Qian, that's why I'm such a good mood.

740
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,980
You called Director Xia, You Qian.

741
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,890
You are...

742
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,580
... My girlfriend.

743
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:16,310
Director Xia. You have been to Pu Lung village for less than three weeks.

744
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:17,860
That's great.

745
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:22,720
In future, that double chin woman won't keep asking you to do this and that.

746
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,030
Who?

747
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,300
Yong Qing.

748
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,690
Grandpa. Yong Qing saved you before?

749
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,480
Yes. Otherwise, I would have send her to etiquette lessons!

750
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,170
What's wrong?

751
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,770
You have a tear in your suit.

752
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,160
Take it off. I will mend it for you.

753
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:52,660
Take it off now.

754
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,260
Thank you.

755
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:17,700
My mom bought this suit for me to celebrate my first job.

756
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,910
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

757
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:22,540
If I had know, I would have sewn it neater.

758
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:23,680
It's okay.

759
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,960
An Xi, be careful.

760
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,150
Be careful you don't prick yourself.

761
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,500
Okay.

762
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,320
This is not a very expensive suit

763
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,700
but my mom bought this for me. It's the best.

764
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:40,090
I wanted to tell her to just buy a fake one from the market

765
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,800
but in the end, she still went to the boutique to buy it.

766
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:50,210
-You Qian, you should take care of your assistant more. <br> -No it's okay.

767
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,890
Director already treats me very well.

768
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:57,320
I don't have a good educational background and was also born in the village.

769
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,030
and clumsy.

770
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:05,030
I am very thankful that Director has chosen me as his assistant.

771
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:08,630
Right? You Qian is a good person.

772
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,790
Thinking of the younger You Qian...

773
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:19,750
Grandpa.

774
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,520
Yes?

775
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,980
Don't talk about past anymore.

776
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,750
Okay, fine.

777
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,490
I won't talk about it.

778
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,300
It's done.

779
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,090
Here.

780
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,960
Put it on.

781
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:54,520
Wow. You are just as awesome as my mom.

782
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,810
Thanks.

783
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,790
You should go home.

784
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,650
Oh right. Why did I stay here so long?

785
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:06,080
Director, Grandpa, Director's girlfriend...

786
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,170
Just call me An Xi.

787
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:11,240
I'm going back first.

788
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,000
I will see you off.

789
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,710
Director. After you got a girlfriend, you've changed.

790
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,760
This is the first time you've seen me to the door.

791
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:27,310
You're not allowed to call her An Xi.

792
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,760
Also, don't just because you find her very friendly that

793
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,650
you would want to get close to her.

794
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,300
Okay.

795
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,230
Good bye. I won't be sending you off. Good night.

796
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,030
You're so cordial.

797
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,650
You're even close with your assistant.

798
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,810
Mei Wen.

799
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:55,330
Do you think that Director Xia will take An Xi to a fancy restaurant in Taipei?

800
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,100
Probably.

801
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,840
Then, then do you think that

802
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,200
Director Xia would take An Xi to the high end department store for shopping?

803
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,070
Maybe.

804
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:11,050
- Then, do you think- <br>- Think about when I'll stop answering your questions.

805
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,280
Now.

806
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,860
You've become smart!

807
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,880
Be more focused, alright?

808
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,660
Yan Ze, you're back?

809
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,770
Yes.

810
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:25,840
Let me introduce my new girlfriend to you.

811
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,430
New girlfriend?

812
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,720
Is that Ya En?

813
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,700
You're so funny.

814
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,600
She is my 3 minute girlfriend.

815
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,240
- Huh? <br>- 3 minute girlfriend?

816
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,030
Is this a new term, or...

817
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:42,360
No.

818
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,910
My clothes got wet, so

819
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,520
Yan Ze took me to buy clothes.

820
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,930
And the store assistant wanted his number, so I...

821
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:53,560
So, you became his girlfriend?

822
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,280
Thank you.

823
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,080
These are the clothes that Ya En got wet.

824
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,310
Oh.

825
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,630
I'll go upstairs first.

826
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,730
Okay.

827
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:08,800
Why would his clothes be wet?

828
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,050
It's so cold.

829
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,970
Where is the air conditioner?

830
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,110
What is this?

831
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,620
Why did he install so many?

832
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,800
One should have been enough.

833
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:53,220
It's so cold.

834
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,070
Grandpa?

835
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:12,140
An Xi.

836
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,180
Come here.

837
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,720
Grandpa. Why aren't you asleep?

838
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,160
Why are you eating biscuits here alone?

839
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,500
I'm hungry.

840
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,480
I couldn't sleep and came down to find something to eat.

841
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,820
You can't sleep too?

842
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,930
It seems like I'm still not used to this place.

843
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,960
I see.

844
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,430
Grandpa.

845
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,740
Don't keep eating biscuits.

846
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,980
You'll suffer from excessive internal heat.

847
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,410
I will cook something for you. Okay?

848
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:39,730
Don't go to all that trouble.

849
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:41,940
It won't be any trouble. It's only just supper.

850
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,830
Wait a minute.

851
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:59,340
Lately, it's just been me.

852
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,590
So I've just let the fridge become empty.

853
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,000
Grandpa. Do you like noodles?

854
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,230
Yes.

855
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,570
Wait for me then.

856
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,300
I will be right back.

857
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,070
Hey.

858
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:21,150
An Xi. It's so late. Where are you going?

859
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,800
I will be back soon.

860
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,450
Taipei has so many alleys.

861
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,460
Where in the world is this?

862
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:34,140
Alley 25? About twenty feet from here.

863
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:39,480
And then you take a right, and another right...And there's the 24 hours open supermarket!

864
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,090
Noodles... noodles.

865
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,730
Right here.

866
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:51,730
Egg tofu...cauliflower.

867
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,070
Galangal!

868
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,700
Yeah.

869
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,420
Hello. Do you have a membership card?

870
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,590
No.

871
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,760
Do you need a bag?

872
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,260
Yes.

873
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,720
Here, Grandpa.

874
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,060
You've waited long.

875
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,320
- Wow. <br>- Tada.

876
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,670
Southeast Asian cold chicken noodles.

877
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,750
Because I was afraid that if you ate noodles that were too hot in the middle of the night

878
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,780
you would get hot and it wouldn't digest easily.

879
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,990
Thus...

880
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:31,120
The colors are beautiful.

881
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,520
One look and I know it's tasty.

882
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,240
It's really tasty.

883
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,980
Grandpa, eat slowly.

884
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:54,200
Here. When you have finished eating your noodles, remember to drink this cassia tea.

885
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,110
It's good for high blood pressure.

886
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:58,210
It's really good.

887
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:00,680
This noodle is clearly cold

888
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,280
but when when I eat it, it's warm.

889
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,890
Because in the cold noodles, I added galangal.

890
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,360
That's why it seems warm.

891
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,020
No.

892
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,830
It's because you keep company when I'm eating.

893
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,830
Grandpa.

894
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:27,080
Does You Qian usually dine with you?

895
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,770
He is busy.

896
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,780
He's home for such a short amount of time.

897
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:35,500
Even when he's home, he would be doing his office work in the study.

898
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,760
I try not to bother him.

899
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,100
As long as he has time, I would rather he sleep more.

900
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,150
I'm already old.

901
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,440
Grandpa.

902
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,500
Don't you feel that this house is a bit cold?

903
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,800
Yes.

904
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,000
You feel this way too?

905
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,610
Yes.

906
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:12,350
I wanted to rear a bird to talk to me

907
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,300
but I was afraid that the bird would freeze to death.

908
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,240
I told You Qian about this.

909
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:23,050
He then placed a bird sculpture that could sing in my room.

910
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:24,310
Huh?

911
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,600
When I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night,

912
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,100
it randomly scared me!

913
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:39,480
Everything in this house is tidy and clean.

914
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,350
There's no homeliness at all!

915
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:43,440
It's as cold as ice.

916
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:54,860
The way You Qian views the world is reflected on this house.

917
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,090
As cold as ice.

918
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:03,760
You Qian must be going against the world all alone.

919
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,820
This is really nice.

920
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:12,680
I haven't been able to eat something made by a pretty girl in such a long time.

921
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:18,010
That double chin woman doesn't even pour me a glass of water.

922
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,870
Miss Hu?

923
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:23,640
I have known that double chin woman for many years.

924
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,400
I couldn't be friendly with her.

925
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,630
But I liked you as soon as I saw you.

926
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:34,790
This is what's called fate.

927
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:37,680
Grandpa. You have good tastes.

928
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,210
I liked you when I saw you for the first time too.

929
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,850
It's a good thing I had returned to my old home.

930
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:46,800
Otherwise, I wouldn't have met you!

931
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,090
Grandpa.

932
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:52,070
Your old house was at Pu Lang Village?

933
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:53,720
Yes.

934
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,060
<i>Pu Lang Village is where You Qian used to live?</i>

935
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,630
<i>Why didn't You Qian tell me about this?</i>

936
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,500
Morning.

937
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,160
What's wrong?

938
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,160
An Xi.

939
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,310
Grandpa said that you're from Pu Lang Village.

940
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:36,270
You...

941
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,250
Are you angry?

942
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,480
What do you think?

943
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,460
Sorry.

944
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:52,130
I didn't intentionally not tell you.

945
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:55,900
- It's because... <br>-It's because you moved when you were young.

946
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,080
<i>Grandpa.</i>

947
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,850
<i> Your old house was at Pu Lang Village?</i>

948
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:03,780
<i>Yes.</i>

949
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:09,990
<i>In the past, You Qian looked like a nerd.</i>

950
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:14,490
<i>He wore glasses when he was very young.</i>

951
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,030
<i>I called him Four Eyes.</i>

952
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:20,690
<i>You Qian wore glasses?</i>

953
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:25,470
<i> Grandpa, if both you and You Qian are from Pu Lang Village, </i>

954
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,710
<i>why I don't have any impressions of you at all?</i>

955
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,430
<i> Oh...</i>

956
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:37,840
<i> That's probably because it's been a long time since we moved. </i>

957
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,890
I know you don't like to talk

958
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,910
But you didn't even tell me you were from Pu Lang Village.

959
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:52,130
Isn't this too much?

960
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:06,020
One day, I'll clear everything up for you.

961
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,500
You have to.

962
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,330
Have you breakfast first.

963
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,340
You made this?

964
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,480
Yes.

965
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,530
I bought it at the supermarket last night.

966
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:23,400
Last night? When?

967
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,490
Last night at midnight when Grandpa was hungry.

968
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:29,220
Midnight? How late was it?

969
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:32,400
A girl shopping by herself at night...Weren't you scared?

970
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,690
It was okay.

971
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:35,600
It was okay?

972
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,150
How many days have you been in my home?

973
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:38,390
This is the first day.

974
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:41,100
Where's the closest police station?

975
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,850
You haven't memorized my address yet, right?

976
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,520
The alleys here are so complicated.

977
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,380
Even during the day it's hopeless, much less during the night.

978
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,550
Never mind. Next time if you want to go out during the night,

979
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,720
you must call me.

980
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,790
I can't do that! Grandpa says that you never rest well during the night.

981
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:56,330
Call me.

982
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,480
But...

983
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,190
Call me.

984
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,450
Okay, okay! You're such a master of worrying.

985
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:08,360
Next time, I'll call, call, call you, okay?

986
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:10,090
For goodness sake,

987
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:13,100
look at all the muscles in my biceps!

988
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,980
I'm Pu Lang Village's part-time expert.

989
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,580
Eat your breakfast.

990
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,700
This breakfast looks really delicious.

991
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:22,670
Of course.

992
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:27,730
I'm the Princess of Breakfast in Pu Lang village.

993
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:29,550
You're Pu Lang Village's what?

994
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:30,580
Okay, stop having so many opinions!

995
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:31,880
My opinions are the ones that count.

996
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,760
Do you have anything else to say?

997
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,690
No - for the moment.

998
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:37,840
Okay, eat now.

999
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,980
Breakfast gives you vitality for the day.

1000
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,400
I cooked Grandpa's oats.

1001
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,090
He can eat it when he wakes up.

1002
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:47,240
Eat it now too.

1003
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,470
I will take you out once we are done.

1004
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:52,300
Where are we going?

1005
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,000
Kissing my pretty girlfriend...

1006
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,240
even a bookworm will feel vain.

1007
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,260
<i>So, she is your first love?</i>

1008
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:10,650
<i>I really overestimated you.</i>

1009
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:12,730
<i> My mom is named Zhou Min Yue. </i>

1010
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:14,290
<i>My father wanted to call her Luna.</i>

1011
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:19,400
<i>Thus, he named the hostel Lunar Maria.</i>

1012
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:26,200
