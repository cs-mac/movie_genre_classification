present

9
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,360
Just like a boy.

10
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,960
- Switch off the light.
- What light? Oh, the light.

11
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Hold it.

12
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,920
Philippe, I asked you
to speak Russian.

13
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,760
Your father put me in service in 1901.

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
Took you in service, Philippe.

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
Took me…

16
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,840
Philippe, turn on the radio.

17
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
The radio.

18
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,200
This is the radio…

19
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,080
He asked me

20
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,240
to speak only French with you.

21
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,480
Here, I found it.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,880
It’s something absolutely amazing,
as your maman used to say.

23
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,960
Uninvited guests.

24
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,640
In the last two weeks there have been

25
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,800
recorded in regions around Moscow
severale cases…

26
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,320
Several.

27
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,160
Several

28
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
cases

29
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,880
of a sudden appearance
of fireballs.

30
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,760
The uninvited guests disappear as
unexpectedly as they appearing…

31
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,040
Appear.

32
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,760
Appear, doing a lot of damage

33
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,480
to the people’s economy, to the health,

34
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,280
and even life, of work people.

35
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,600
Working people.

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,280
The direction of the fireballs’
movement

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,360
directly depends

38
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,120
on the activity of their position

39
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,560
neary objets.

40
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,880
- Near.
- Near.

41
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
- Objects.
- Objects.

42
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,720
Some believe that
this phenomenon is nothing less

43
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,560
than a partie of well…

44
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,560
- Part.
- Part.

45
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,800
…well thought-out
and prepared sabotage.

The tanks!

73
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,440
Tanks are coming, mama!

74
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,400
The tanks!
Mama! Grandma!

75
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,520
There! Get it!

76
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,080
- Come on!
- There you go!

77
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,440
Come on!

78
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,320
Marusya.

79
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
That’s all. A blissful break.

80
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,600
Give me the duckbill.

81
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,840
The duckbill? Here.

82
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
Marusya.

83
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
What?

84
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,560
The tanks! The tanks, Ilyushka!

85
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,320
Turn back!
You’ll ruin the crops!

86
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,960
Are you crazy, Lieutenant?

87
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,680
- Get out of here!
- Oh, you!..

88
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,040
Gee up, Boy!

89
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,440
Wait! Where’s
Zgoryanka or Zagoryanka?

90
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,200
- I’ve got lost.
- There’s no such village here.

91
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,200
- What?
- There’s no such place. Go back.

92
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,120
- What do you mean, back?
- I’m busy.

93
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,760
It’s only 7, and he’s too busy already.

94
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,240
I’ll soak it. I’ll soak it.

95
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
What do you think it is?

96
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,720
This is a shirt. A man may
have anything in his shirt.

97
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
I’ll soak it. I’ll soak it.

98
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,920
Maybe he has 3 rubles in his shirt.

99
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,040
Or whatever,
some documents.

100
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,080
- Who is there?
- I need to see Kotov.

101
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,480
- The tanks are going.
- You know what time it is?

102
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,080
- I need to take my medicine.
- I need Kotov. It’s an emergency!

103
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,360
What happened?

104
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,400
Who are you?

105
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,640
- Comrade Kotov.
- What do you want?

106
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,720
You must help us.
The tanks are going over the field.

107
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,760
What tanks?

108
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,520
Our tanks. They’re ours.

109
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,360
- No one can stop them but you.
- How do you like that!

110
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,280
- Only me!
- No one else.

111
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,560
Thank you very much, my dear.
It’s my day off!

112
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,760
To stop the tanks…
Found yourself a scapegoat.

113
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,240
They’re begging you to come.

114
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,160
What do you have your chairman for?

115
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,960
- The chairman’s on a dirigible.
- On a dirigible!

116
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,600
The NKVD has arrived,
he oh’s and ah’s.

117
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
- Oh’s and ah’s.
- Crying.

118
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,640
Crying…

119
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,040
- Everything depends on you.
- I got only one day off!

120
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,680
- Where shall I run?
- Here’s the horse.

121
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
- What?
- Can you ride without a saddle?

122
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,400
Please.

123
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,240
Here we go!
My day off!

124
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,680
Hi.

125
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,560
- What’s the horse’s name?
- Boy.

126
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,160
Stand, boy. Stand.

127
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,280
All right, keep up with me.

128
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,240
Dad! Where are you going, dad?

129
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,480
Just one day off!
No, they have to rouse Kotov!

130
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,560
They have to find Kotov in a bathhouse!

131
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,360
What are you doing?

132
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,000
This is the people’s bread grain!
I’ll send you to the tribunal!

133
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,040
What are you doing?!

134
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
What are you staring at?
Get out of here!

135
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,440
Why?
I’ve got an order!

136
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,600
What order?

137
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,680
Don’t you yell!
I’ve got my own commander.

138
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,600
What?

139
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,120
Hold him. Not afraid of the tanks,
but shit yourself before a horse?

140
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,840
Are you nuts or what?!

141
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,680
You goat!
Get lost before I shot you!

142
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,760
I’m going to wipe my ass with you,
Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

143
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
- What?!
- Attention!

144
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,680
- I’ll show you!..
- Who are you?

145
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,720
Don’t you know me?

146
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,360
Perhaps you didn’t recognize me?

147
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,160
And now?

148
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,560
You recognize me now?

149
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,480
Comrade Kotov…

150
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,120
Stand still.

151
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,760
Who is your commander?

152
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,200
I…
Brigade Commander Lapin.

153
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,160
Lapin? Oh God!
All right, where’s your liaison?

154
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,440
What liaison?

155
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,280
Sexual, my ass!
Where’s the wireless?

156
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,480
The aviation is coming, Comrade Division
Commander. What do we do?

157
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,920
The aviation is coming!

158
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,600
They’re flying in the sky!

159
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,760
Comrade Kotov!

160
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,800
Why are you standing?

161
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,120
I’ll tell you why we’re standing.

162
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,480
Who is that?

163
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,440
A fish in the net.

164
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,840
It’s Sergey Kotov.
Hi, Misha.

165
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,480
- Kotov?
- That’s right.

166
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,520
Comrade Division Commander?
What are you doing there?

167
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,040
Scattering sticks and
picking them up to form bricks.

168
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,760
- What?
- Yes, yes.

169
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,320
Misha, perhaps you’ll be taking
prisoners and bombing cities too?

170
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,880
The lieutenant here agrees with me.

171
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,400
Yes, he agrees. He agrees.

172
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,040
Look here, Misha.
Do you remember me well?

173
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,600
Yes, Comrade Division Commander.

174
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,200
- You remember me very well?
- Very well, Comrade Commander.

175
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,760
Then turn your machines back

176
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
and devise another stratagem.

177
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,040
- Yes, Comrade Division Commander.
- Repeat it, please.

178
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,800
Yes, Comrade Division Commander.

179
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
There you go.

180
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,680
And what’s your name?

181
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,160
I say, what’s your name?

182
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Misha. Oh, sorry, Kolia.

183
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,120
I was a bit rude to you, Kolia.
Please, excuse me.

184
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,480
Why this stupid smile, Kolia?

185
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,160
And you make your ears grow,
to see the road better.

186
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,360
You see?
I recognized him right away.

187
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,200
Turn the machines around!

188
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,360
Why didn’t you go home?

189
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,000
- You were swearing!
- Who?

190
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,960
My God, you swore like hell!

191
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Me?

192
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,200
Me? When?
Did I swear, Nadya?

193
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,200
as for me, I didn’t hear anything.

194
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,360
Why are you saying it then?

195
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,040
I got only one day in a week.

196
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,280
Can I spend it with my family?
To say a thing like that!

197
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,400
- No one forced you to say it.
- What wrong did I say?

198
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,080
He got so excited. He was shouting:
bread grain, field, collective farm!

199
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,400
What do I have to do with it?
I’m not a Michurin, am I?

200
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,320
It’s just amazing!

201
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,080
Orders, my dear, must be carried out.
I’ll stick up a watermelon to them!

202
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,880
But they obeyed me, didn’t they?

203
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,960
Though they may stick up
a watermelon to me, too,

204
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,840
and they’ll be just right.

205
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,840
Seryozha, there’re no watermelons now,
they’ll come later.

206
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,840
What?

207
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,480
At dinnertime.

208
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,240
Some family!

209
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,240
Even your uncle, Marusya,
is crazy, though he’s a professor.

210
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,040
I don’t understand why one should
go to this dirty village bathhouse

211
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,920
when he has a wonderful, clean bathroom.

212
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,600
I know. I know.

213
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,480
Suvorov, Kutuzov and Pushkin, -
they all washed in a bathhouse.

214
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,200
But a child has no business
in a bathhouse.

215
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,480
Vsevolod, why do you always keep
silent?

216
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,200
You are… like Switzerland,

217
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,960
you’re well-fed and aloof.

218
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,960
On the contrary. I’m hungry
and passionate like a Gypsy.

219
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,640
You always sit in the way,
with those legs of yours…

220
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,720
Oh, damn it!

221
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,600
Our commander is right,
this is a madhouse.

222
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,640
The tired-out tender sun

223
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,400
To the sea bade its farewell,

224
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,800
When you came to me to tell

225
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,320
That there was no love.

226
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,840
Masha, Goshka, hi!

227
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,280
Hi! Hands off! Hurray!

228
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,640
Grannies, what are you doing there?

229
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,760
Why did you start all this?

230
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,480
- Why? I don’t understand.
- What do you mean, why?

231
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,960
Borya had brought these medicines
before the Revolution.

232
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,160
Why are you throwing them away?

233
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,880
It’s the only way.
Look how many of them.

234
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,400
And she stuffed in some grass, too.

235
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,800
You know that
she’s crazy about medicines.

236
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,400
The doctor prescribed
for her to take iron,

237
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,000
so she boiled nails
and drank the broth.

238
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,360
Girl!

239
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,560
Yes?

240
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,720
Girl!
Excuse me, girl, is this Zagoryanka?

241
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,920
Why Zagoryanka?
What Zagoryanka?

242
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,240
Maybe Zgoryanka?

243
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,320
Oh, my God…

244
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,960
Excuse me, young man,
is this WAMP?

245
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,840
Yes, it’s some swamp.

246
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,760
What do you mean, swamp?

247
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,160
A community of writers, actors
musicians and painters.

248
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,320
The acronym is WAMP, my friend.

249
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,840
She’s coming.

250
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,240
Right, like salted dough.
What is this?

251
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,840
Confession is the mother of justice.

252
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,160
The young pioneers brought it
for Comrade Kotov.

253
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,760
For breakfast.

254
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,960
No, can you imagine it?
Confession is the mother of justice.

255
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,560
Seva, please, no comments.
Your tongue is your worst enemy.

256
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,040
I’ve always believed and still believe

257
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,400
that presumption of innocence
is the foundation of any law,

258
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,960
including the Roman law
which I have the honor to teach.

259
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,160
Stop it. Stop it.
It’s just some buffoonery.

260
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,400
- Olia, when will you give me a haircut?
- You think you need it?

261
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,360
Don’t you see how overgrown I am?

262
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,680
Borya just loved it
when I cut his hair.

263
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,520
Bring me the mail.

264
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,800
My brother had
an awful hair style.

265
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,400
But it was so…

266
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,400
We had another purge.

267
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,760
Half the faculty body
was fired for poor knowledge

268
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,280
of the original works
of Marxism-Leninism.

269
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,040
They haven’t touched me.

270
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,120
Uncle Seva, play it.

271
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,760
- What?
- Play something.

272
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,240
Wait, it’s my dental plate…

273
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,840
I’m sorry.

274
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,000
Nadya, this instrument is yours.

275
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,840
I’ll show you
how to blow it!

276
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,800
Look!

277
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,000
- Bravo!
- Very good.

278
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,920
Where was I…

279
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,640
I wanted to say something very
important… Oh, yes!

280
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,160
Here I am!

281
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,640
Lyolya, what are you doing?

282
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,480
It’s like a greatcoat,
will never wear out.

283
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,000
It’s not ready yet.

284
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,440
Everything is great.
Don’t be angry, please.

285
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,360
It will look beautiful.

286
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,520
I’m upset.

287
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,480
I wanted to demonstrate a really good
thing.

288
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,680
You can already see it’s good.

289
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,480
It becomes you.

290
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,440
- It does?
- Very much.

291
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,240
There it goes again.

292
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,880
An infuriated virgin
is more fearsome than a tiger.

293
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,520
She sucks nails.

294
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,400
One day we’re going
to discover her poisoned corpse.

295
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,080
Good morning to everybody!
Happy holiday, ladies and gentlemen!

296
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,560
Pardon, comrades.

297
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,000
Mokhova!

298
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,760
- Don’t touch Katya.
- These are some biscuits.

299
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,040
They’re preparing something great!
The celebration of Stalin’s dirigible!

300
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,920
What? Right.

301
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,040
What’s going on?

302
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,480
It’s the dance of a bird that flew
in a dirigible, our dear enchantress.

303
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,120
An interesting word – entrance,
enchantress, sorceress.

304
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,480
How rich is the Russian language!
What do you think, Sergey Petrovich?

305
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,440
- Happy holiday!
- Yes…

306
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,320
Why is he picking on me?

307
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,160
Really,
you shouldn’t, Sergey Petrovich.

308
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,920
He never takes
alcohol.

309
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,000
Never.

310
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,520
No, don’t say anything. After all,
today is holiday. It’s hot.

311
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,840
You know what I just remembered?

312
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,520
You know what I remembered?

313
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,680
I remembered how Grand Duke
Dmitri Pavlovich

314
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,960
rocked him as a child.

315
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,000
Yes.

316
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,280
He rocked him, rocked, and got him
over rocks…

317
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,320
…early in the morning.

318
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,560
You’re like Petya Trofimov.
Chekhov had one, remember?

319
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,080
- “The Cherry Orchard”.
- Yes, the perennial student.

320
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,160
And you’re a perennial docent. All
your friends are academicians already.

321
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,640
Oh no! They’re not my friends.

322
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,920
My friends… Some have been
gone, the others far away.

323
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,720
- Where’s the debt?
- What debt?

324
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,800
That I’ve given for the sodas woman.

325
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,000
- Mother, why are you in a coat?
- I tried it on.

326
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,080
- It’s so hot, and you’re in a coat.
- I had to demonstrate it.

327
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
I’ll return it tomorrow. Honest.

328
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,320
Where’s the hot dish?

329
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,280
Kirill, do you always drink chacha

330
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,280
in the morning after port wine?

331
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
You know, Sergey Petrovich,

332
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,840
drinking shouldn’t be looked upon
as a vice, so to speak…

333
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,440
How did you put it?
As a vice of the will.

334
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,720
It should be regarded as
a movement of a distressed soul.

335
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,280
Enchantress!

336
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,680
Enchantress!

337
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,360
And you borrowed 5 rubles from Marusya.
Why don’t you return it?

338
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,560
It’s not nice, is it?

339
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,440
The tea is cold too, by the way.

340
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Come on. What’s the matter with you?

341
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,200
See, he got hurt.

342
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,000
Lyuba Grusheva.

343
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Lyuba, why didn’t you say
you were coming here?

344
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,920
I would’ve given you a lift on my
bike. It’s so romantic.

345
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Especially when it’s a ladies’ bike
without a crossbar.

346
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,560
So what?

347
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,680
I don’t know. I never rode
a bicycle without a crossbar.

348
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,040
Are we going swimming?

349
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,960
- Yes!
- Greetings!

350
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,640
- Greetings.
- Are you going swimming?

351
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,600
It’s not me. Of course I am.

352
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,160
When will you learn not
to throw things about?

353
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,400
Well, Lyuba dear,
your thesis is not bad.

354
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,360
Oh, great! Comrade Kotov!

355
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,360
We have his portrait at our faculty.

356
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,000
- On a horse?
- No.

357
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,720
Without a horse. On foot.

358
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,080
Do you have my portrait too?

359
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,520
And who are you?

360
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,120
Me?

361
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,280
I’m that horse in a dress.

362
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,600
You’re joking.

363
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,320
I’ll tell you later.

364
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,360
Yes, Mokhova, that’s the end of your
medicines.

365
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,400
Boris Konstantinovich brought a French
one. I forgot against what.

366
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,000
Don’t cry, Mokhova, please.

367
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,000
I’ll tell dad
to bring you more pills.

368
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,720
Oh, the pioneers, Mokhova!

369
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,200
Don’t cry.
The pioneers never cry.

370
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,480
The pioneers are coming.

371
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,240
It’s some holiday today.
You know which one?

372
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,720
You know, I don’t understand
their holidays.

373
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,920
But I know it’s some big day,
something big and Soviet.

374
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,080
- I think I’ll lie down, too.
- Sure.

375
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,320
I feel somewhat…
somewhat giddy.

376
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,080
I’d better lie down.

377
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,280
And Nadya…

378
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,240
Nadya knows all the holidays, every one.

379
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,720
My God!

380
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
Whose smell am I sniffing?

381
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,360
Can it be the future pioneer
and exemplary girl Nadya?

382
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,840
How do you know me?

383
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,120
Well!

384
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,560
How would I not know
the future most exemplary student?

385
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,800
Perhaps you’re a summer Santa Claus?

386
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,880
Yes!

387
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,160
Nadya, I’m a magician from Maghreb.

388
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,600
What’s Maghreb?

389
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,840
Well. Maghreb is the country
of summer Santa Clauses.

390
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,960
A Soviet country?

391
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,080
Of course.

392
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,600
All summer Santa Clauses
live only in a Soviet country.

393
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,760
- What about winter Santas?
- Winter ones, too.

394
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,760
- Maybe you’re a doctor?
- Quite.

395
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,800
Mokhova needs a doctor.

396
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,760
- Is she still alive?
- Yes, alive.

397
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,400
My great-grandmother Lyolya
has drowned all her medicines.

398
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,920
She alive, too?

399
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,600
Very much alive!

400
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,480
Mokhova!

401
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,600
Mokhova!
He’s to see you, Mokhova.

402
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,480
Out of the way, virgin!

403
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,880
Who invited you here?

404
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
What?!

405
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,760
Attendez!
Go wash Marusya’s peepees!

406
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
We’ve got a lot of our own nutcases
here.

407
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,480
What do you want here?

408
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,120
Silence, polygamist!

409
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,760
What do you mean?

410
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,400
Happy holiday,
valorous great-grandmothers!

411
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,800
Why great-grandmothers?
I’m not even a grandmother yet.

412
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,160
Katya! Katya!
Anybody!

413
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,200
Why do you have to stamp your feet?

414
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,480
You’re here too, the lover of sweet
wines and capricious women.

415
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,560
34-15, extension 19.

416
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,920
What did he say?

417
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,720
That’s the office telephone number.

418
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,640
Hello!

419
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,200
Mitya!

420
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,000
I didn’t recognize you!

421
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,120
My God, Mitya, my dear!

422
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,760
That’s what Borya used to say
when Marusya was a baby.

423
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,320
Go wash Marusya’s peepees.

424
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,000
Dmitri, I must tell you…

425
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,480
Uncle Seva!

426
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,720
Welcome back, Mitya.

427
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,400
At last, Mitya.

428
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,280
Quiet, please.

429
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,640
Please meet my husband, Sergey.

430
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,040
And this is that very Mitya,

431
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,560
a friend of the house, my father’s pet.

432
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,160
His best student.

433
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,920
- Kotov.
- Pleased to meet you.

434
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,880
- Me, too.
- We’ve met before, you know.

435
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,960
Of course, I remember.

436
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,520
You have?

437
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,760
It was long ago, fleetingly,
and in the past life.

438
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,040
- And who is this?
- Our daughter, Nadya.

439
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,320
Nadya, you can call me Uncle Mityai.

440
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,680
Uncle Mityai!

441
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,640
Close your mouth.

442
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,960
Mokhova!

443
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,840
You’re my undrilled pearl.
Are you still undrilled?

444
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,600
Mokhova never dusts, does she?

445
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,960
Who?
I never dust?!

446
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,440
Never dusts, as usual.
Wait!

447
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,360
Wait. The New Year eve. From 1927
to 1928, before I left.

448
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,800
We were hiding presents.

449
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,440
I hid a chocolate right here.
Mokhova, I hid a chocolate.

450
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,360
Nothing!

451
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,880
Everyone has a holiday,
but they have to spoil it for me.

452
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,840
Lydia Stepanovna, he does it
on purpose!

453
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,560
Marusya, please, give me some
water. I’m dying of thirst.

454
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,440
Is Philippe with you?

455
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,520
Philippe is with me. I’ll tell you
everything after I wash up.

456
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,880
Has he grown old?

457
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,200
I’ve never seen him young.

458
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,520
Mitya!

459
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,800
Are you married?

460
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,160
Yes, I’m married.

461
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,760
- Do you have children?
- I do.

462
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,720
- How many?
- Three!

463
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,520
Good boy!

464
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,400
- You haven’t given up music, have you?
- No.

465
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,040
Mitya, I must ask you,

466
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,520
in all these years…

467
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
Yes? Yes?

468
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,400
Never mind. Later.

469
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,400
- Uncle Mityai!
- Yes, Aunt Nadya?

470
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,240
What would you have,
tea with jam or coffee with milk?

471
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,920
I’ll have coffee with jam.

472
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,360
Isn’t it something!
Grandma!

473
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,600
Uncle Mitya said
he’d have coffee with jam.

474
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,800
No, he couldn’t!

475
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,120
Nadya!

476
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,720
- Nadya, how old are you?
- Six!

477
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,120
Olga Nikolayevna, remember when
Marusya was 6 and I was 16?

478
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,120
We went to the Bolshoi Theatre.

479
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,160
Boris Konstantinovich was conducting.

480
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,680
Mitya, I’m very sorry.

481
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,760
Just until the evening…

482
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,880
Tonight I’ll…

483
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,320
Mitya.

484
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,680
I’ve brought him a towel.

485
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,560
The overture started, and she
nudges me: “I want to pee.”

486
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,880
Thanks, Mitya.

487
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,120
I say: “We’ve just arrived. Hold it.”

488
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,840
And she: “I want to pee.”
I say: “Hold on.”

489
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,240
And she says: “I want to pee.
I want to pee.”

490
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,160
Everybody begins to “sh” at us.

491
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,640
But she says she wants to pee,
and that’s it.

492
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,200
And where can I take her?
She says: “I won’t go alone.”

493
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,560
I can’t take her to a men’s room,
and I can’t go to a ladies’ room.

494
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,360
What do I do?
I’m dragging her to the men’s room.

495
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,920
And we run into Rakhmaninov coming
out of there.

496
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,600
Rakhmaninov… and he says:
“Whose is this…

497
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,800
…lovely child?”

498
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,440
I say:
“It’s Boris Konstantinovich’s child.”

499
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,240
He says:
“Such a good boy.

500
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,480
Tell Borya
to buy him trousers.”

501
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,880
Coffee or tea?

502
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,720
I just wanted some water.
Nothing for me, thank you.

503
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,880
Thank you, I had a late breakfast.
Bon appetite.

504
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
This is dad’s chair.

505
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,160
Nadya, aren’t you ashamed of yourself?

506
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,440
Dad, you did drive Kirik away.

507
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Kirik deserves it.

508
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,880
- Dmitri.
- Yes.

509
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,480
I didn’t mean that.

510
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,560
Dmitri, in yesterday’s Pravda…

511
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,200
- Serge, I asked you, didn’t I?
- Mother.

512
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,680
Marusya, you want to drink something?

513
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,440
Me? No.

514
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,280
And why this…

515
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,680
This?

516
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,440
This is a glass.

517
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Yes…

518
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Well, how about it?

519
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,640
Are we going swimming?
We’ve already wasted half a day.

520
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,240
- Let’s go swimming!
- With pleasure!

521
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,360
- Where’re your things?..
- Hanging over there.

522
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,840
Kirik, come on!

523
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,080
Everything as before.

524
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,440
You haven’t changed a bit.

525
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,200
Only a different hairstyle.

526
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,560
As for you, you’re not
changing either.

527
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,280
- Really?
- Come on…

528
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,400
Too late for us to change…

529
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,400
- The sugar.
- I’ll get it, mother.

530
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,680
Today at 17 o’clock,

531
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
on an open stage of the Park of
the Taking of Bastille,

532
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,800
a gala concert will take place

533
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,280
playing the works of
composer Dvinyayev,

534
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,880
dedicated to the 6th anniversary
of the national holiday

535
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,960
of Stalinist dirigible construction
and aeronautics.

536
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,040
The admission is free.

537
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,600
Happy holiday, dear comrades!

538
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,160
I won’t give it!
I won’t give it!

539
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,840
Comrade. Comrade.

540
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,360
What time is it?

541
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,000
Halt! Attention!

542
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,000
At ease, guys.
Happy holiday!

543
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,320
Mokhova, don’t thrust dolls at me,
I’m not little anymore.

544
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,960
What else shall I thrust at you?

545
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,720
You’re supposed to play with dolls.
Stop being naughty.

546
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,560
Not little anymore…

547
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,240
I want to be a pioneer so much.
I just can’t wait.

548
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
Why?

549
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,520
What do you mean “why”? To get up
to a bugle, to go swim to a whistle.

550
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,720
Yeah, and lie in a coffin to an orchestra.

551
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Why?

552
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,400
Don’t you understand?

553
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,600
To get up by a bugle.

554
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,360
To a whistle…

555
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,400
…go swimming.

556
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,240
To a drum…

557
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,240
…go marching.

558
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,680
Dining to an accordion.

559
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,200
If you do it all well,
you’ll be lying in a coffin

560
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,800
to an orchestra.

561
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Why?

562
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,760
Marusya, I’ll go to the platform.

563
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,680
Listen, Uncle Mityai.

564
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,160
- Why are you saying thar?
- What am I saying?

565
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,320
Stop pestering him.

566
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,120
Am I pestering him?

567
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,960
Yes, you are.

568
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,840
I like that!

569
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,640
All right, you may sit here. I’m off.

570
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,280
Here, play with it.

571
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,400
Nadya!

572
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,800
What?

573
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,400
Nothing. Go run.

574
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,160
Attention! Whoever found a white
poodle named Filimon,

575
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,360
please come to Dacha No.17

576
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,200
and ask for the guard of
the order-holding professor Kalyuta.

577
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,720
Happy holiday, dear comrades!

578
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,920
Why are we pouting?

579
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,680
What happened to you?

580
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,600
Mom drove me away.

581
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,560
Mom drove you away?

582
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,960
Oh-oh-oh, mom drove us away.

583
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,400
Oh, what a bad mom.

584
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,240
You must have been pestering them?

585
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,120
With your questions?

586
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Honest?

587
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,160
They want to talk.
They’re old friends.

588
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,280
They haven’t seen each other
for so long.

589
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,080
And here some kid nags them with her
questions.

590
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,480
We’d better go and take
a boat ride.

591
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
Sergey!

592
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,160
Don’t! You know I don’t like it.
Let her swim here.

593
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Marusya.

594
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,040
We’ll decide it ourselves, all right?

595
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,960
We’ll be all right.

596
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,120
And you sunbathe and rest.

597
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,800
Strong bronzed shoulders.

598
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,960
Of course, I understand.

599
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,640
A white-teethed smile,
portraits in every office.

600
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,760
But it can all be destroyed!

601
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,640
With a flick of the fingers.

602
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,720
Olga Nikolayevna, remember when
Marusya was that little?

603
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,840
Of course, I remember.

604
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,200
She was about 2 months old, I think.
And, respectively, I was 10.

605
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,600
You took me to her crib,

606
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,920
and said: “Here, Mityul,
meet little Musya.”

607
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,760
I reached with my finger
for her hand,

608
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
and she suddenly grabbed my finger!

609
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,520
And she opened her eyes.

610
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,280
Then she farted and said:
“Come closer.”

611
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,840
What nonsense you’re talking!

612
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,400
How could I say anything
being only 2 months old?

613
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,440
You said it, you did.

614
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,800
If you didn’t say it, you thought it.

615
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,720
And what is this?

616
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,240
- You didn’t have it before.
- What?

617
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,840
It’s nothing, I brushed it against a cover.

618
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,920
What cover?

619
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,000
A coffin’s cover.

620
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,880
I wonder, if we ask them,
can they turn it on louder?

621
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,840
Marusya.

622
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,720
Why don’t you
ask me about anything?

623
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,040
You keep silent.
Why do you keep silent?

624
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,240
I’m reading.

625
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,040
Why don’t you ask?

626
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,920
I don’t want to know anything more.

627
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,120
What do you mean “more”?

628
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,080
More than I already know.

629
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,960
It’s interesting.

630
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,360
What do you know?

631
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,520
What is this?

632
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,920
When did you do this?

633
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,600
- Back then.
- And?

634
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,040
They had saved me. I didn’t know
I was supposed to do it in the water.

635
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,160
So the blood doesn’t coagulate.

636
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
Marusya.

637
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,960
Musya, Mityul.

638
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,040
DEAD.

639
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,400
- DEAD!
- Quiet!

640
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,440
Defense exercises and drill.

641
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,760
Civil defense exercises again.

642
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,280
A chemical attack.

643
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,480
Go away.

644
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,520
Go away, or they’ll take you.

645
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,640
- They’re still far away.
- They’ll take you again!

646
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,400
They’ll put on you those hoses again!

647
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,240
I’m scared.

648
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,160
They’ll put gas masks on us again,
grab us by our breasts.

649
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,440
We can still get away.

650
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,600
They caught us then,
those perverts.

651
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,160
- Porters, Katya.
- What porters?

652
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,960
Perverts. They grabbed me
by my breasts, my knees.

653
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,600
Any girl would be only happy.
Stop talking nonsense.

654
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,200
- What are you saying?
- A big deal.

655
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,360
I’m a virgin, and they grab me.

656
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,200
Everyone in the neighborhood
knows you’re a virgin.

657
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,400
Look at your little heels.

658
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,720
So round, so soft, so beautiful.

659
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,720
And take mine.
Just look at them.

660
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,120
See?
Like soles of a boot.

661
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,880
Hard and worn.
You can put out cigarettes with them.

662
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,840
Have you run a lot?

663
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,320
Yes, I have run and I have walked.

664
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,200
Where did you run?

665
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,000
Now after them, then from them.

666
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,680
And you’ll have those heels of yours
till your old age.

667
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,480
- Why?
- Why?

668
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,800
You’ll always have them
that round.

669
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,160
Because there’ll be many
airplanes and automobiles,

670
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,920
streetcars, trolleybuses, the metro.

671
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,840
The roads will be very smooth.

672
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,720
The shoes will be very comfortable,
the socks will be very soft.

673
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,960
Why?

674
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,880
What do you mean “why”?

675
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,680
Because that’s what we’re building
the Soviet power for, Nadya.

676
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,400
So that everyone has their heels as
round as yours till their old age.

677
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,560
And so they don’t need
to run from anybody.

678
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,440
You’ll just walk quietly, honey.

679
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,120
Only study well.

680
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,960
Respect your parents.

681
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,720
And love your Soviet motherland.

682
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,640
How hot you are.

683
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,800
Why are you so hot?

684
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,320
You’re not sick, are you?

685
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,880
- Honest?
- Honest.

686
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,280
Oh, Dad, I feel
so good with you.

687
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,520
Really?
And I feel good with you.

688
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,840
I feel peaceful with you.

689
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,640
I feel so easy with you.

690
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,160
I just adore you, Daddy.

691
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,000
We’ll be always sailing
with you like this, right?

692
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,080
And with mom.

693
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,960
Of course, with mom. By all means.
How can we do without mom?

694
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,320
I’ll go and swim.

695
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,760
Comrade, what time is it?

696
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,760
Are you all right?

697
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,480
Will you help this poor invalid up?

698
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,800
Yes, yes, of course.

699
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,360
- Half past one.
- Thanks.

700
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,480
What a fool.

701
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:15,800
Mitya.

702
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,280
Mityul.

703
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,680
Mitya!

704
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,640
- You got scared?
- You stupid!

705
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,920
- Got scared, didn’t you?
- Let your wife get scared for you!

706
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,520
Remember this spot?

707
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,240
A month after
Boris Konstantinovich’s death,

708
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,040
you caught
Olga Nikolayevna with Kirik.

709
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,360
It was awful.

710
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,880
You got so upset,
and ran away from home.

711
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,280
I found you here.

712
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,920
Right here.

713
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,160
It was cold.

714
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,800
It was raining.

715
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,080
I tried to persuade you to come back,
but you wouldn’t.

716
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,680
And I stayed with you.

717
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,920
Don’t you remember?

718
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,120
You don’t remember it either?

719
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,760
We spent the night
in a buoy-keeper’s shed.

720
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,120
Our first night.

721
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,840
And what was next?

722
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,000
I had a book by Shakespeare
with me, “Hamlet”.

723
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,040
I read it.

724
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,960
She cried. You…

725
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,840
…cried.

726
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,880
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears

727
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,280
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes…

728
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,920
You know what I remember
especially clearly?

729
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,600
The print on your belly.

730
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,320
From an elastic.

731
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,480
It was so pinkish.

732
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,880
- Like a baby’s.
- Why are you telling me this?

733
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,920
I don’t know why.

734
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,040
Marusya.

735
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,600
I thought that
since I had no life here,

736
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,600
it meant no one else had.

737
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,360
And no one was left from the former
life.

738
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,160
And now I find out that you’re all here.

739
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,400
And everything is as before with you.

740
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,760
Only without me.
Have you crossed me out?

741
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,160
Erased me…

742
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,400
…with a rubber?

743
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,520
A gas attack!

744
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,520
A gas attack!

745
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,960
It’s a matter of state importance.
Put on the gas mask.

746
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,800
Put on the gas mask.

747
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,600
It’s the duty of every Soviet man and
woman

748
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,320
to strengthen civil defense

749
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,520
against the hydra of world
imperialism and fascism.

750
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,720
Forward!

751
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,600
I got your umbrella.

752
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,680
Let’s go. Don’t worry,
everything will be all right.

753
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,000
Hey, comrade!

754
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,160
Don’t you need wounded
people, comrade?

755
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,760
- We do.
- I’m wounded.

756
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,400
- Seriously wounded.
- Seriously?

757
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,520
- A gas mask.
- Yes!

758
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,960
- Lie down.
- Yes!

759
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,440
Forward.

760
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,520
Just a second!

761
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,880
Just a second!
Comrade! Comrade with a trunk!

762
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,760
And what about me? What about me?

763
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,400
- What’s the matter with you?
- I’ve been killed.

764
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,040
- We don’t take the killed.
- What do you mean you don’t?

765
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,200
A stretcher!

766
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,480
- A gas mask.
- Now you’re wounded.

767
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,040
And forward.

768
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,640
Oh, it hurts so much!

769
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,560
Forward!

770
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,040
Forward!

771
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,440
Let me go, now!
Do you hear?

772
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,280
The girl on the front stretcher,
what’s your name?

773
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,000
I was ahead of you in line.

774
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,680
The Red Civil Defense is

775
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:17,200
the Soviet land’s strong shield against
the aggression of world imperialism!

776
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,960
Happy holiday, dear comrades!

777
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,760
I am on a cherry tree,

778
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,240
Cherries are so yummy.

779
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,800
Uncle Stalin’s telling us

780
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,400
To obey our mommy.

781
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,360
How’s that?

782
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,400
Where’re our folks?

783
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,680
Yes, it’s interesting.

784
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,360
Look, they’ve left the shoes,

785
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,200
and the ball,
and the book.

786
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,720
- And they left without us.
- Yes.

787
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,280
Daddy, why are you running?

788
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,080
Nadya.

789
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,200
Am I running?
I’m just walking.

790
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,120
You’re not catching up with me?
Let me carry you.

791
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,240
Like on a horse.
Here we go.

792
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,120
Let’s go and look.
Where can they be?

793
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,840
Daddy, can you imagine
if I forgot my book on the beach?

794
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,200
- What would mom have done to me?
- What would she have done…

795
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,480
- Daddy, it hurts.
- Where does it hurt? Where?

796
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,360
You’ve got some character. Mom is right,
you’ve got a hell of a character.

797
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,960
Daddy, you’re crushing my tummy.

798
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:08,080
Look, daddy, uncle Mityai’s pants
are hanging, and his shirt.

799
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,840
See how interesting? Uncle
Mityai has already hung his pants.

800
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,520
Come on, hang it.

801
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,000
- How can I hang it?
- Try to do it somehow.

802
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,040
Take aim and hang it.

803
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,200
Well, enough.

804
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,600
That’s it. That’s it.

805
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,840
Enough, that’s it.

806
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,040
Enough, I’m afraid, enough, enough!

807
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,240
I just recalled how Borya decided

808
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,520
to let the poor student Mitya
earn some money

809
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,960
by giving Musya
music lessons.

810
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,560
As long as I was in the room,
everything was very serious.

811
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,280
Legato, staccato,
pedaling, fingering.

812
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,120
Once I left them,
and it took me a while to stay out.

813
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,560
And suddenly I hear…
What did you play, Mitya?

814
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,040
Cancan!

815
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,160
Mother comes in, and I…

816
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,200
I was as little as Nadya,
and I was doing like this.

817
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,560
Dances!

818
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,520
Oh, no, come on.

819
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,320
Sergey Petrovich.

820
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,400
Why are you dining alone?
Why didn’t you wait for everybody?

821
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,440
I wanted to call them, Mokhova.

822
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,800
But I don’t speak French.
Yet.

823
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,920
Give me a napkin.

824
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,200
And you, Mokhova…

825
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,440
…do you speak French?

826
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,360
Then you, too, go to…

827
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,560
Shall I help you?

828
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,080
Dinner?

829
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,600
Let’s go and eat!
And where’s Sergey Petrovich?

830
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,760
Sergey Petrovich is already eating.

831
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,720
Mitya, your clothes must have dried
already. I’ll bring them.

832
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,160
Marusya, why are you
clutching my clothes so?

833
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:37,680
Hey, men, the address here,
it has washed off.

834
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,240
Help me. A village of
Zagoryanka, or Zagorka.

835
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,480
I’ve been circling the neighborhood
since morning.

836
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,440
How did you get here?

837
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,880
Get out of here, quick!
It’s a secret object here!

838
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,680
Get out of here!

839
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,240
How beautiful! How wonderful!
Just like when Borya was alive.

840
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,920
Oh, my God…

841
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,480
I remember Lyolya
singing this from the stage.

842
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,240
Oh, what a time it was!
What a time!

843
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,840
The time isn’t so bad now either,
but…

844
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,200
The general aroma…

845
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,520
The taste of life.
It has disappeared.

846
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,320
For good.

847
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,320
To listen to you, your life
used to be so good.

848
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,520
Yes, good.

849
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,600
Why didn’t you defend it then?

850
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,760
- I beg your pardon?
- Why haven’t you defended it?

851
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,440
We were defending ourselves.

852
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,200
How were you defending yourselves?
Why did you run?

853
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,440
- Who ran?
- You. Why did you run?

854
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,200
You, all armed,
supported by the Allies’ Intervention.

855
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,600
All strong and with shoulder straps.

856
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,520
Why were you running
from poor, illiterate people?

857
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:52,000
I, for one, had never had
any military training.

858
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:56,280
But I was driving you on and on,
from the Urals all through Siberia.

859
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,400
I was driving you all right.

860
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,640
It’s a philosophical question.

861
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,320
Right.

862
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,680
It’s a philosophical question,
my dear academician.

863
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,720
You always say that,
because you had nothing to offer.

864
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,720
You wanted everything to remain
as it was before.

865
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,080
Why? Because you hoped
everything would resolve by itself.

866
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,040
It would just resolve.
But it didn’t.

867
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,920
And now we’re reminiscing – oh-oh-oh,

868
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,960
what a life we had,
how good we felt,

869
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,960
how beautiful it was.

870
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,960
Sure, some of you
did the right thing

871
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,760
and began to serve the Revolution.

872
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,240
Efficiently, honestly,
with total dedication.

873
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,160
By the way, Sergey Petrovich,

874
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,760
though I’ve been pronounced
unfit for army service…

875
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,360
Because of your flatfoot.

876
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,440
Because of my flatfoot.

877
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,800
But I was…

878
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,280
…wounded.

879
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,800
In a poolroom with a ball.

880
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,720
Why do you keep arguing,
my dear comrades?

881
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,760
Oh, Nadya.

882
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,360
You know how they would call you
if you lived in France?

883
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,320
Nadine.

884
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,200
No. Nadia.

885
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,600
You know what, Nadia?

886
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,200
Come here.

887
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,080
Come, I’ll tell you a fairy tale.

888
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,840
A fairy tale.

889
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,080
In a certain realm
in a far-off land,

890
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,240
there lived once a boy
whose name was Aytim.

891
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,760
He could sing beautifully,

892
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,800
played many different
instruments and loved poetry.

893
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,160
And his parents were friends
with a very kind wizard

894
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,840
named…

895
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,560
…Sirob.

896
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,360
- Without a tail.
- Without a tail.

897
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,320
And the kind Sirob liked little
Aytim very much.

898
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,880
And he took him into
his house to raise him

899
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,160
and teach him magic music.

900
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:39,600
And they came to love each other, like
father loves son and son loves father.

901
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,120
That’s how the story goes, Nadine.

902
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,360
Soon Sirob had a daughter.

903
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,400
And they named her…

904
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,920
…Aysum.

905
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,160
A funny name.

906
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:02,240
Sirob had a big house,
filled with light and noise,

907
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,040
full of merriment,
and, of course, a happy house.

908
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,240
- Like ours.
- Like ours.

909
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,160
Like yours.

910
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,120
Bit one day it all ended.

911
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,440
The coffee on a verandah
from white cups like those.

912
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,000
The charades,
and the croquet after dinner.

913
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,040
And the reading aloud
to the cricket’s singing.

914
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,200
And the debates and laughter,
everything had ended.

915
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,280
It had ended
because a war broke out.

916
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,960
A war with whom? With the bourgeois?

917
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,560
It doesn’t matter with whom, Nadine.

918
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,840
What’s important…

919
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,360
…is that Aytim went to fight.

920
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:52,840
And all that time,
in the trenches and in a hospital,

921
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,840
and in different countries,

922
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,920
every day,

923
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,000
yes, Nadine, every day

924
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,680
he was thinking of the big house,
and of the garden,

925
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,240
and of all the faces, and even
of the old cricket

926
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,400
whom everybody had cursed
when he interrupted the reading.

927
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,120
We have a cricket, too,
over there.

928
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,240
That’s a different cricket.

929
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,760
He sings cheerful songs.

930
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,760
And the other one sang sad songs.

931
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,880
Let’s have a drink, Nadya?

932
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,880
- Are you crazy?
- Let’s have a drink.

933
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,880
Let’s have it.
So, for 10 years he was wandering…

934
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,480
Oh, here we are!…

935
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,720
He was wandering over different lands.

936
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,240
He did all kinds of things:
drove a taxi cab,

937
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,440
played the piano in restaurants,

938
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,920
sang in the streets,
danced in a cabaret.

939
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,400
He even sewed slippers.

940
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:55,640
Thanks.

941
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,520
And all that time
he was terribly homesick

942
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,720
for that house.

943
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,840
The house he had lived in before.

944
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,920
And in 10 years he came back.

945
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,960
His parents were dead.

946
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,600
They were killed
in that war with the bourgeois.

947
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,720
He had nowhere to go anymore,

948
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,000
and right from his train
he ran to his teacher.

949
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:28,640
It was wintertime.

950
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,760
And, but the snow, he didn’t
recognize a thing in his country.

951
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,600
So much it had changed.

952
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,200
Only the house was as before.

953
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,880
His heart skipping a beat, he rang…

954
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,520
…the bell.

955
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,160
The door was opened by a girl

956
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,680
of such a beauty

957
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,840
that Aytim had never
seen anywhere,

958
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,800
though he traveled over many countries.

959
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,640
“Who are you?”
asked the dumbfounded Aytim.

960
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,320
“I’m Aysum,” answered the beauty.

961
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,440
“Oh, my God,
are you the Aysum

962
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,840
who peed under the columns

963
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:21,720
and fell asleep on your father’s knees
when he taught music to me?”

964
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,720
“Yes, I’m that Aysum. Come on in,
we’ve been waiting for you.

965
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,080
But our father is very sick.”

966
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,480
And the dumbfounded Aytim was standing
and looking at the beautiful Aysum.

967
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,880
And he couldn’t utter a word.

968
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,880
I know what was next.

969
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,720
What was next?

970
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,320
They got married and…

971
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,680
No, they didn’t.

972
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,680
They didn’t get married.

973
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,960
- Why not?
- Because they didn’t have time.

974
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,160
Because Aytim was summoned by
an all-powerful and important man.

975
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,120
Who?

976
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,080
- Who?
- Kashchei the Immortal?

977
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,760
- Not as important as Kashchei.
- Wood goblin?

978
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,840
No, not the wood goblin.
I don’t remember his name.

979
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,520
He summoned him to his
big house and said:

980
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,520
“Look, my dear
Comrade Aytim,

981
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,960
go I don’t know where

982
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,520
and do…”

983
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,240
I don’t know what.

984
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,600
Right.

985
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:33,560
Aytim answered him: “How come,
my all-powerful master,

986
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,880
I mean, comrade. I’ve traveled
a lot, I’ve fought a lot.

987
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,960
I want to live peacefully with my family.”

988
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,280
And that man says: “You’re talking
like a philistine, dear Aytim.

989
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,120
Like a philistine.”

990
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,200
What is “philistine”?

991
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,440
Not right.

992
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,200
“You’re talking bad, Aytim. Very bad.

993
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,080
You’ve been let
into the country

994
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,560
not to build your bourgeois,
bad nest.

995
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,920
So pack your things

996
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,800
and write an application of your own
will.

997
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,200
You got a week
to think it over, otherwise…”

998
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,080
Your head will roll.

999
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,920
Right.

1000
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,920
And so, Aytim went home,

1001
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,440
very sad and unhappy.

1002
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,760
He walked about, dark and gloomy,
he thought hard,

1003
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,920
then he packed his things and left,
not saying a word to anyone.

1004
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,200
Why?

1005
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,400
Because he had
nothing to say, Nadine.

1006
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,840
He’d seen too much blood and woe.

1007
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:50,720
And he didn’t want that blood and
woe to come to his dear house.

1008
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,120
And because, Nadine,

1009
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,880
he was only 27.

1010
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,920
Like your mother is now.

1011
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,920
And he wanted to live so much.

1012
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,120
And what about the princess?

1013
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,840
The princess?

1014
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,560
The princess cried and cried,

1015
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,120
cried and cried,

1016
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,200
and got married.

1017
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,640
To whom?

1018
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,920
To Kashchei?

1019
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,320
To the man
I don’t remember the name of.

1020
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,200
Marusya, wait.

1021
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Wait.

1022
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,000
Wait, Marusya.

1023
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,240
Don’t… don’t come near me,
or I’ll jump out of the window.

1024
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,000
Marusya, it’s embarrassing.
Listen, there’re people there.

1025
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,120
Marusya, there’re people there.

1026
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,080
It’s embarrassing.

1027
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,120
Come here.

1028
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,040
Please, don’t come near me.

1029
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,680
Marusya.

1030
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,160
Come here.
Come to me, my darling.

1031
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,640
You know, after sleeping
we’ll play soccer.

1032
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,280
- Where?
- On the croquet court.

1033
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,960
Play soccer?
Why not croquet, like before?

1034
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:07,160
Because daddy says that croquet
and tennis are bourgeois games,

1035
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,800
and soccer is not a bourgeois game.

1036
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,360
Good boy.

1037
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,920
Who’s a good boy?

1038
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,160
Your daddy is a good boy.

1039
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,720
Yes.

1040
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,120
Daddy is always a good boy.

1041
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:28,400
You know, tomorrow
daddy and I are going to the zoo.

1042
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,720
I’ve been to the zoo one
hundred times already in winter.

1043
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,680
And never in summer,
because we’re at the dacha.

1044
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,880
They even carried the grannies out
once in Moscow, they swooned.

1045
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,760
I can show you.

1046
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,880
I am there too.

1047
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,120
Where?

1048
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,600
Right here.

1049
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,080
And what is Aydan?

1050
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,000
Aydan is…
Think.

1051
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,320
So it’s you who smell of wine.

1052
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,120
- It’s not true.
- It is.

1053
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,320
Nadya, the granny isn’t sleeping.

1054
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,360
Oh, here’s the one who smells of wine!

1055
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,960
The one who drinks must eat.

1056
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,360
You’re at it, too! You’d better
learn good things from your daddy.

1057
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,160
Go and play
with kids of your age.

1058
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,760
Want to get it on your buns?

1059
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,520
Mitya, you get what I mean?
Will you?

1060
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,440
No.

1061
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,800
Are you really married?

1062
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,880
No, not married.

1063
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,480
So you lied.

1064
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,200
- I lied.
- I see.

1065
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,000
- You lied.
- I lied.

1066
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,360
Everybody is sleeping.

1067
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,800
The land of Nod.

1068
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,880
Want a candy?

1069
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,560
You remember?

1070
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,400
You smoke now.

1071
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,520
You disappeared, and not a line
from you.

1072
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,720
Where do you work?

1073
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,520
In the NKVD.

1074
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,720
Kidding as usual.

1075
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,960
- I’m serious.
- Where do I work…

1076
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,880
I played in a restaurant near Paris,

1077
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,120
now I play near Moscow, in Podolsk.

1078
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,160
You should’ve said so.

1079
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,960
I remember it. I remember.

1080
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,680
And where do you work?

1081
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,920
Me?

1082
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,520
There’s a rest home not far from
here, I show movies there.

1083
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:40,480
You smoke,
and still you have good hair.

1084
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,440
And I’ve got a problem.

1085
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,440
When did you come back?

1086
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:46,840
Six months ago.

1087
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,120
Why didn’t you come?

1088
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,360
There was no occasion.

1089
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,960
Are you kidding?
You know what was going on with her?

1090
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,320
Did you see her arms?
She cut up her veins.

1091
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,880
She’d been waiting for you over a year.

1092
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,440
It’s only later…

1093
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:12,840
that this commander appeared, with
flowers, Conservatory, restaurants.

1094
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,000
What could she do?
A hero!

1095
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,040
Did you come back for good?

1096
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,400
For good.

1097
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,360
What about her?

1098
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,440
Though the commander would
look great with horns.

1099
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,480
What are you doing? It hurts.

1100
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,680
Sorry, I miscalculated.

1101
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,400
I have to work in the evening.

1102
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,720
Wait, wait, wait…

1103
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,640
You’re my joy…

1104
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,080
- Can you do it?
- I’ll try.

1105
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,200
Come on!

1106
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,320
Was it you who helped him?

1107
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,800
Yes, me.

1108
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,160
Marusya.

1109
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,760
He left himself,
of his own will.

1110
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,320
He had a choice.
There were many like him.

1111
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,760
But…

1112
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,840
He would’ve been arrested.

1113
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,760
He had no choice.

1114
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,240
Man always
has a choice, Marusya.

1115
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,560
He may say something or he may not.

1116
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,480
He may go or he may stay.
There’s always a choice.

1117
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,040
Why didn’t I know?

1118
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,960
I don’t know,
so many years have passed.

1119
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,080
You remember that many
people were sent abroad then,

1120
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,240
to embassies, missions,
journalists.

1121
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,840
Besides, he…

1122
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,880
He had an experience of living
abroad, he knew languages.

1123
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:03,160
Marusya, let’s move
to a state-owned dacha.

1124
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,960
Come on.
You know how good it is there?

1125
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,080
Everything’s in order, everything’s
clean,

1126
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:14,880
with a fence,
white chair-covers, billiards,

1127
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,840
a volleyball ground, guards.

1128
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,000
They frown on me in the Kremlin.
I’m a division commander, Marusya.

1129
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:26,120
Just look, Marusya, what’s this?
Look, we live like paupers.

1130
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:30,320
If you want, we can take
your grannies with us.

1131
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,720
Tell me…

1132
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,560
If you had to do it,

1133
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,600
would you go, leaving Nadya and me?

1134
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:43,960
Of course I would.

1135
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:46,880
I’m a military man.

1136
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,200
Marusya, dear.

1137
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,840
I would have gone because I…

1138
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,720
…love my homeland.

1139
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:03,600
And he went because of fear,
to stay alive.

1140
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,920
See the difference?

1141
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,920
My darling.

1142
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,320
Because of duty or because of fear?

1143
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,400
You see the difference?

1144
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,520
Good work.

1145
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,320
And let me, my dear friend
Nadine, ask you

1146
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,360
if you can do tap dance?

1147
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,320
- Let’s go, I’ll teach you.
- Let’s go.

1148
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,960
Mara, do a flick, will you?

1149
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,000
Flick it.

1150
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:17,720
Please,
do it for me, Marusya.

1151
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,200
I’m begging you.

1152
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,480
You’re my joy!

1153
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,440
Once again.

1154
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:08,360
Mitya.

1155
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,560
What?

1156
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,360
Mitya.

1157
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:30,680
I wanted…

1158
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,480
I got it, Marusya. I know.

1159
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:38,520
I’ll leave soon. Ask Sergey
to come down for a couple of words.

1160
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,960
Are you leaving?

1161
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:53,480
Frankly, Nadine, I am not.
I can’t lie to you.

1162
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,840
A car will come for me in the evening,
then I’ll leave.

1163
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,680
Hurray! A car!

1164
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,600
But it should be our little secret. Not
a word to anyone. A military secret.

1165
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,400
Well, Nadya.

1166
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,520
Go out and play for a while.

1167
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,120
All right, do you know this game?

1168
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,360
Who can sustain a note longer.

1169
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,240
You breathe the air in, you exhale -
I count, I exhale…

1170
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,840
- I count.
- Yes.

1171
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,520
Let’s try it.
Inhale deep.

1172
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,040
Did you call me?

1173
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:42,680
What is it?

1174
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,400
All right, listen.

1175
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,120
Not a word to anyone.

1176
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:07,040
You’re our guest.
So behave like a guest.

1177
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,000
The car will arrive, we’ll go together.

1178
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,960
We have soccer today.
Do you play soccer?

1179
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,280
- I played once.
- So we’ll play.

1180
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,320
We always play soccer on Sundays.

1181
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,440
Perhaps you didn’t understand?

1182
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,000
Everything’s clear.

1183
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:26,880
We got 2 hours before the car.
Why waste time? It’ll be soccer.

1184
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,600
Soccer! Where’s that bird
flying away in a dirigible?

1185
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,080
Daddy, wait.

1186
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,800
- What?
- Look.

1187
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,840
Good for you!
Great, Nadya, good girl!

1188
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,240
Daddy!

1189
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,840
You know what
uncle Mityai can do?

1190
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:52,320
Uncle Mityai can do nothing.
Stop it, Nadya, don’t embarrass me.

1191
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,640
Well, go ahead.

1192
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:56,880
- Come on, show us.
- Don’t be shy.

1193
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,040
All right, stop.

1194
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,680
Look, Nadya. Look here.

1195
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,640
Can your uncle Mityai do like this?

1196
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,360
What?

1197
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:35,520
This is the dance of a bird flying
away in a dirigible. Soccer!

1198
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,880
- Hey, man!
- What?

1199
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:45,160
- Is this the way to Zagorenka?
- What?

1200
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:48,520
Is this the way to Zagorenka,
or Zagoryanka?

1201
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,280
There’s no such village here.

1202
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:53,320
What do you mean, no?
I’ve been shown this way.

1203
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,800
Who showed you? This way is
Grebnevo, my brother lives there.

1204
01:37:57,160 --> 01:38:00,120
Zagorenka, Zagoryanka…
There’re no such villages here.

1205
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,440
- What?
- They said go that way!

1206
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:06,520
Motherfuckers,
they said go that way!

1207
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:09,800
Look, you sucker in an Asian cap,
come here.

1208
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:14,440
Listen carefully,
I’m saying it in plain Russian.

1209
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,440
If you go this way,
there’ll be Petryayevo, then Kuzemlya,

1210
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,280
then Petrovo, and then Goryayevo.

1211
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,960
But no Zagorenka.
Get out of here!

1212
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,000
- Fuck you!…
- What?!

1213
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,200
For this collective-farm
hay, shit,

1214
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:33,200
I’ll make you eat
your cap, you parasite!

1215
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:35,960
Idiot!

1216
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,880
Get out of here!

1217
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,120
You don’t know a shit!

1218
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:47,800
You asshole, you don’t know a shit!

1219
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:53,480
You live here, idiot,
and don’t know nothing!

1220
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:18,880
Sergey Petrovich!

1221
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,520
You found it?

1222
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,520
- The ball?
- No. But I’ll find it.

1223
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:41,800
It must be somewhere here.

1224
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:46,320
Sergey Petrovich, it looks strange.

1225
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,960
Perhaps you haven’t understood.
You’ve got only an hour.

1226
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,400
What are you wasting it on?

1227
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:56,840
You thought I’d be burning papers

1228
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,160
or decide to shoot myself?

1229
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,600
I’m interested in something else.

1230
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,440
Did you come here yourself,
or did they made you, Andersen?

1231
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,640
What?

1232
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,280
Fucking storyteller.

1233
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:12,880
Why didn’t you…

1234
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,480
Why didn’t you mention
in your fairy tale

1235
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:19,120
that since 1923

1236
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,120
you’ve been recruited by the OGPU

1237
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,560
and, as a secret agent

1238
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,800
nicknamed either Pianist,
or Musician,

1239
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:33,320
turned in to us 8 high-ranking
officers of the White movement?

1240
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,240
With your help they were kidnapped,
brought here and shot

1241
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,560
as counterrevolutionaries
and enemies of the people.

1242
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,880
- You believe they are not?
- Me?

1243
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:44,880
They are.

1244
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,280
Only I fought against them for 4 years.

1245
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,480
And you fought for them, on their side.

1246
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,960
And then you turned them all in.

1247
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,000
Eight men: General Kornev,

1248
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,160
General Weiler, Mashkov, all of them.

1249
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:03,280
Sergey Petrovich, you know well
that they forced me to do it.

1250
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,720
Who?

1251
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,800
Who forced you, my dear angel?

1252
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:12,960
I didn’t know you back in ’23,
I never heard of you.

1253
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,720
They bought you.

1254
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:18,160
Bought you in a most vulgar fashion,
for francs.

1255
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:21,480
Don’t dare talking to me
like this!

1256
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,280
I was dying to get back here,
to this house.

1257
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,560
They’d promised me and I was foolish
enough to believe them.

1258
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,880
You friends told me:
do this

1259
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,440
and we’ll let you come back.

1260
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:37,560
And they cheated on me, and deprived
me of everything.

1261
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:39,840
Everything!

1262
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,720
My life, profession,

1263
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,560
love, Marusya, faith,
homeland – you took it all!

1264
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:50,440
Oh, that’s why you came here.

1265
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,160
To savor it.

1266
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,800
To savor your hurt.

1267
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,840
Drop by drop, gulp by gulp…

1268
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,920
…to drink it in.

1269
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,600
And then…

1270
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,520
Bang!

1271
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,840
You’re under arrest, citizen Kotov.

1272
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:15,560
By the way, I’ve done
a malfeasance

1273
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,000
by warning you.

1274
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:17,800
You’re lying!

1275
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,520
You’re lying again.

1276
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
You’re again acting
like a lousy whore.

1277
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,920
Working both sides of the street.

1278
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,160
So that I remember it.

1279
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,160
You know how it’s going to end.
Who will dare touch me?

1280
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,160
Who will dare touch me?!

1281
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:40,040
Kotov, the Revolution’s hero, legendary
commander. Who will dare touch him?!

1282
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,800
Oh, I’ll make you remember all this.

1283
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,520
Oh, I’d love to look at you

1284
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,040
in some five days,

1285
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,760
when you,
crawling in your own shit,

1286
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:57,680
will sign voluntarily
a confession

1287
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:01,240
that since ’20 you’ve been
a German spy,

1288
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,840
and a Japanese one since ’23.

1289
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,960
And that you’re a saboteur and organizer
of an attempt on Comrade Stalin’s life.

1290
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,240
And if you don’t sign it, bastard,

1291
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:14,200
we’ll remind you
that you have a wife and a daughter!

1292
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,160
Daddy!

1293
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:23,400
The pioneers are coming to you!
Your pioneers are coming!

1294
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,000
What pioneers? Why?

1295
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,520
And where’s uncle Mityai?

1296
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,240
Uncle Mityai has found the ball.

1297
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:37,400
Nadya, do you know why they
keep hurting me in this house?

1298
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:41,480
Daddy, your pioneers are coming!
Hurry!

1299
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:44,880
- Mitya, come on. Uncle Mityai!
- Let’s go. That’s all. Come on.

1300
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,600
Come on! Come on!

1301
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:49,880
There’re pioneers with flags there!

1302
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
- Did I hit you hard?
- No, it’s all right.

1303
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,520
Why did they send you ahead?

1304
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:58,720
So that you didn’t do any foolish things.

1305
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,280
- Will there be a search?
- Yes. Tomorrow.

1306
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:05,280
- Why tomorrow?
- So it’s not in my presence.

1307
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,480
I see.

1308
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:11,520
Look, not a word to anyone. The car
arrives, we go together. That’s it.

1309
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:13,240
- All right.
- You promised me.

1310
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:16,560
The detachment, named after the hero
of the Revolution and the Civil War,

1311
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,360
the order-holding Bolshevik

1312
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,080
and the legendary Division Commander,
Comrade Kotov,

1313
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:24,840
has lined up to give a solemn oath
personally to Comrade Kotov.

1314
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:26,360
One, two!

1315
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,760
We, young Leninist pioneers

1316
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:34,040
of the detachment named after
the hero of the Civil War,

1317
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:37,160
a loyal follower and comrade-in-arms

1318
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,800
of Comrade Stalin,

1319
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:44,880
the order-holding Bolshevik,
the legendary commander Kotov,

1320
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,960
in front of our comrades

1321
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:51,280
and in presence of Comrade Kotov
personally,

1322
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,320
give a solemn oath

1323
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
that we shall be faithful successors
to the cause of Lenin and Stalin,

1324
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:03,560
the first heroes of
the Great October Revolution…

1325
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,120
Hey, girl, is this Dacha No.9?

1326
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,920
9!
Don’t you see it’s 9?

1327
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:02,720
I’ve been waiting for you for a long
time!

1328
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,200
You came for uncle Mityai.

1329
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,840
I’m going to call him.
Uncle Mityai!

1330
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,040
There we go.

1331
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,520
Uncle Mityai!

1332
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,720
Uncle Mityai, where are you?

1333
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,880
A car has come for you.

1334
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,400
So it’s time to go.
Where’s your dad?

1335
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,120
- I don’t know.
- I need him now.

1336
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,600
Uncle Mityai,
may I sit in your car?

1337
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:30,480
You may.

1338
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,360
Thanks.

1339
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:39,360
I’ll be driving. Hurray!
You hear, granny? I’ll be driving!

1340
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,280
Mitya.

1341
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,640
Why did you make up that fairy tale?

1342
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,960
You know, once I sat
by your father’s bedside.

1343
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,560
He was already very sick then.

1344
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,120
He was unconscious.

1345
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:09,240
Suddenly he opened his eyes,
took my hand and said:

1346
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:11,920
“What a pity.

1347
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:17,160
I’ve lived such a long,
interesting and beautiful life.

1348
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,000
And what am I seeing before dying?

1349
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:25,760
Some trains with geese.

1350
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:29,440
What a pity.

1351
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,480
How silly it is.”

1352
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,920
Later we found out
those were his last words.

1353
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:47,640
Why have you never
told me about it?

1354
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,760
There’re many things I haven’t
told you about, Marusya.

1355
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:02,560
Me, too.

1356
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,200
Is that his daughter?

1357
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:53,320
Who knows? Perhaps she is.

1358
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:56,600
It looks like she’s his daughter.

1359
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:23,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

1360
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:25,560
Bon appetite.

1361
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,720
I’ll go as far as the turn with you.

1362
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,840
I’ll drive in the field.

1363
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,960
At the wheel.

1364
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,040
What are you munching?

1365
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:48,640
Food.

1366
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,720
Shall I bring you some
of my granny’s pie?

1367
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,480
No, thanks.

1368
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:56,240
Nadya! Nadya!

1369
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:59,160
Don’t tell them
I was outside the gate.

1370
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,760
Coming, grandma!

1371
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,520
A smart girlie.

1372
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,400
I told you she’s his daughter.

1373
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,000
Ever seen him?

1374
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:11,800
I have.

1375
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:14,440
On those…

1376
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:17,080
On portraits.

1377
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:18,960
I see.

1378
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:24,320
- Did you call me, Grandma Lisa?
- No. Your daddy called you.

1379
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,080
Where?

1380
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,160
Where’s he?

1381
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:32,640
Why are you scaring me?
Jumping like a boy.

1382
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,200
He’s upstairs.

1383
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:41,040
Lyolya.
How long do I have to wait?

1384
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:42,280
I’m sorry.

1385
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,160
- It’s cold.
- No, it’s all right.

1386
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,320
Daddy!

1387
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,240
Daddy!

1388
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,880
There you are!

1389
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,480
Why is your cup here?

1390
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,320
Did you drink?

1391
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:05,640
You did?

1392
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:07,560
I did.

1393
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:09,480
And didn’t eat?

1394
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:11,400
I didn’t.

1395
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:21,360
Where are you going?

1396
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,160
You leaving today?

1397
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,960
The car is here.
I’m going to Moscow.

1398
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:30,400
- And where’s your car?
- It’ll come tomorrow.

1399
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:34,720
At 9. I’ve got some business…

1400
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:39,600
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, at 8.
- At 8, right.

1401
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,800
Hurry up, uncle Mityai told me

1402
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:45,960
that I can drive
the car, too.

1403
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:50,080
Drive as far as the turn.
Come on, hurry, daddy.

1404
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:58,720
Dad, remember Mitya was
telling me a fairy tale?

1405
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:02,120
Remember what funny
names there were in it?

1406
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:04,080
So it turns out…

1407
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:09,480
If I had been in it, you know
what name I would have? Aydan.

1408
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,320
- What does it mean?
- It’s Nadya backwards.

1409
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,320
Come on, hurry.

1410
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,120
Dad…

1411
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:24,360
You know, we can’t
go to the zoo tomorrow.

1412
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:26,120
I’ll be busy.

1413
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:30,600
- Don’t get angry, all right?
- We’ll go some other time.

1414
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:35,520
Duckbill.

1415
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:41,080
Oh, what a duckbill we got.

1416
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:44,080
- Dad, can you play this game?
- What game?

1417
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:47,960
Look, you cover your ears and hum.

1418
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:52,440
- How is it?
- Like this.

1419
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,200
What?

1420
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:58,600
You stop up your ears and hum.

1421
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,760
- What kind of a game is that?
- Who can hum longer.

1422
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,160
- Who can hum longer?
- Yes.

1423
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,240
Three, four.

1424
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,200
I’m little, I may to do it two times.

1425
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,320
And I may do it three times!

1426
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:32,840
I may do it three times,
because I’m little.

1427
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,080
It’s awesome!

1428
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:15,000
Hurry up, daddy, they’re waiting for us.

1429
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:16,280
Let’s go.

1430
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:18,880
Let’s go, Nadya.

1431
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:23,640
I’m Vsevolod Konstantinovich.

1432
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:27,800
Did you come for
Dmitri Andreyevich?

1433
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:29,960
How nice.

1434
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,560
May I ask you

1435
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,840
what organization
is sending such an auto?

1436
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,760
Regional philharmonic society.

1437
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:51,200
Yes, yes, yes…

1438
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,440
Philharmonic society…

1439
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,440
Where are you going?

1440
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:15,440
Here we are!

1441
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:18,240
The car is here, so I can go with them.

1442
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,040
Why are you in full regalia?

1443
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,320
Smoking is bad for you.

1444
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,920
Marusya, you must just know everything.

1445
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:27,240
Remember, better on your breast
than on a pillow on your hearse.

1446
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:28,960
Let’s go, storyteller.

1447
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:32,320
Sergey Petrovich, please
bring me a rose facial cream.

1448
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:35,920
And where’s your bird
that flies away in a dirigible?

1449
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:41,560
We’ll see you off.

1450
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:48,600
Mokhova!

1451
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,320
Mokhova!

1452
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:53,080
First-rate semaphore!

1453
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:01,680
Come on, say it: “Grusheva, Lyuba”.

1454
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,960
Grusheva, Lyuba!

1455
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:07,560
Good! Now say:
“Grusheva, Lyuba!”

1456
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:12,040
Good! Say: “Commander…”

1457
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:15,640
- Commander stupid!
- Quiet!

1458
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,480
Some nightmare!

1459
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,920
Nadya, is this the car?

1460
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:28,560
- Whose car is it? Yours?
- Yes, mine.

1461
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:30,120
What a beauty!

1462
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:32,520
Meet my comrades.

1463
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,960
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1464
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,880
Let’s go and have tea on our terrace.

1465
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:41,760
We’ve got a pie!
A delicious pie!

1466
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,920
Excuse me.

1467
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,360
What tea?

1468
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:47,360
We’ve drunk up the samovar empty.

1469
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,240
What’s your name and patronymic?

1470
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:53,000
- Just call me Vassily.
-No, it’s not polite.

1471
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:39,640
Again! You want to ride me again!

1472
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:44,280
Somebody, sit beside her.

1473
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,640
Daddy, come sit by me, you’ll see
how I’m driving.

1474
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:48,840
No, Nadya!

1475
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:53,200
Your dad will seat in the back,
he’ll see better from there.

1476
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:54,320
All right.

1477
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,920
Dmitri Andreyevich, the guitar.

1478
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,480
Mokhova!

1479
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:03,080
Well, Mitya.

1480
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,760
We haven’t sung today.

1481
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:09,160
Yeah, we haven’t.
Well, start singing.

1482
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:38,040
Nadya, only as far as the turn, and
come right back home!

1483
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:15,880
Good for you, Nadya.

1484
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:27,360
Well, Nadya, thanks for giving us
a ride. Step on the brake.

1485
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,600
Run back home.

1486
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,120
Your mom is waiting for you.

1487
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:38,880
All right, dad. Bye.

1488
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:40,360
Bye.

1489
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:43,520
Excuse me, please.

1490
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:47,640
Have you been in the zoo?

1491
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:48,560
What?

1492
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:50,720
- Have you been in the zoo?
- Sure I have.

1493
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,000
Why did you run away?
Did they feed you badly?

1494
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:56,880
Nadya!

1495
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:00,640
You can’t talk
like this to grownups.

1496
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,560
- It’s not nice.
- Sorry.

1497
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:04,840
Get rolling.
Nadya, go home, your mom’s waiting.

1498
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
All right, bye.

1499
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:53,320
Shall we have a drink?
Shall we? I’ve got something.

1500
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,080
Here it is.

1501
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:58,240
Let him.

1502
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:01,440
You think I’ll take poison?
No, I won’t.

1503
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,400
Will you?

1504
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:10,200
As you like.

1505
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,880
- Mityul?
- No, thanks.

1506
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:17,200
How about some cognac, soldier?

1507
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,920
Neither drink, nor smoke.

1508
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,960
I’m not offering it to the driver.

1509
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:27,080
Guys, congratulations on the holiday

1510
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:30,520
of Stalinist aeronautics
and dirigible construction.

1511
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:38,880
You got any arms?

1512
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:41,680
Yes?

1513
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,840
I’m asking, you got any arms?

1514
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:48,400
Are you nuts or what? I’m a division
commander. Of course I got arms.

1515
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,720
Give it up, please.

1516
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:54,640
I see.

1517
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:59,400
Be careful, it’s loaded.

1518
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:16,480
Oh, boys…

1519
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:22,720
Look at the sunset.
Tomorrow will be a fine day.

1520
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:25,800
Shall we sing?

1521
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,400
Let’s sing, Mityul.
Remember this?

1522
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:35,800
The morning welcomes us with cool air,

1523
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:40,920
The river welcomes us with the wind.

1524
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:45,360
My darling, why are you in despair…

1525
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:46,960
My darling is in despair.

1526
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:55,280
Where are we going?

1527
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:02,840
Maybe we’ll go to “Aragvi” restaurant,
guys?

1528
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:07,400
You’ll be my guests.

1529
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:17,480
Mityul, do you know
this phone number – 24-37?

1530
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:20,200
No.

1531
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:26,400
You don’t.
And you can’t know it.

1532
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:30,280
Because it’s a direct line
to Comrade Stalin.

1533
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:34,920
And tomorrow…
No, today.

1534
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:42,520
I’ll call him, and there’ll be
a turmoil in your department…

1535
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,560
Trains with geese.

1536
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,960
Oh, boys…

1537
02:06:57,400 --> 02:07:01,800
You’ll get everything: geese with
apples and chickens with giblets.

1538
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:07,400
What is that jerk doing all sprawled
out there?

1539
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:09,800
- Pass him on the right.
- Yes.

1540
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,600
Only no stupidities.

1541
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:16,640
Of course not.
They’ve all been done already.

1542
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:23,800
Burned up all gasoline!
Driving since early morning.

1543
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:25,920
Hi!

1544
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:29,080
My wife washed my shirt,
with the address in its pocket,

1545
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:31,520
and I don’t remember whether it’s
Zagoryanka or Zagorenka.

1546
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:33,440
I can’t find it…

1547
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:37,120
Nobody knows a shit!
Some assholes live here!

1548
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:42,280
I ask everybody, they send me places!
I’ve been driving about all day!

1549
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:43,920
Nobody knows a fuck!

1550
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:45,040
Look, man…

1551
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:48,280
Give me a bit of gasoline,
and I’ll move off.

1552
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:49,600
What are you looking for?

1553
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:55,240
Comrade Kotov! Is that you?

1554
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,000
Wait.

1555
02:07:58,360 --> 02:07:59,520
Perhaps you need Nagorye?

1556
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,280
I don’t remember.

1557
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:04,320
Nagorye is the other way.
I’ll show you.

1558
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:06,960
- Are you crazy?
- Sit, bastard!

1559
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:28,200
You’re strong, son of a bitch!

1560
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:46,400
Stop!

1561
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:49,600
Come back.

1562
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:55,000
Comrade. Comrade, I just…

1563
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:57,720
I got the address washed off.

1564
02:08:58,120 --> 02:09:02,200
I’m just moonlighting,
I got the papers.

1565
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:04,440
- I have the documents…
- Freeze!

1566
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:06,360
Hands behind your head.

1567
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:09,640
Hands behind your head.

1568
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:22,360
Handcuff him.

1569
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,840
Comrade, you know…

1570
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:27,880
I just…
I got the address washed off.

1571
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:30,400
Comrade, comrade…

1572
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:34,520
I’ve got all the papers,
they’re in the truck.

1573
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,040
It’s just… I’m only…
They’re waiting for me there.

1574
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:40,960
The customer is waiting.

1575
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:45,920
I just need… He waits since morning.
My papers are all in order.

1576
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:49,320
Comrade… Comrade, I am…

1577
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:50,800
I am…

1578
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:07,840
Comrade Stalin.

1579
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:22,400
Comrade, comrade…

1580
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,640
Comrade, is it really
Commander Kotov in the car there?

1581
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:39,160
Over there, in the car,
is it really Commander Kotov?

1582
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:43,360
No, just his look-alike.

1583
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,200
- Documents.
- What?

1584
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:06,160
- Your documents.
- Here. They’re in order, comrade.

1585
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:08,960
My wife…

1586
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:14,680
Comrade, what about my driver’s
license…

1587
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:17,320
Comrade…

1588
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:20,960
- What are you doing…
- Hurry, and let’s roll.

1589
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:24,840
- Alexei.
- Yes.

1590
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:30,440
Take him.

1591
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,160
The tarpaulin.

1592
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:36,560
Let’s go.

1593
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:51,280
You’re only good at working
as a ticket collector.

1594
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,840
Just think what they’ve schemed up.

1595
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:30,480
He could’ve run away.

1596
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:34,640
- Look how he put his truck.
- Bullshit artist.

1597
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:37,920
Blocking the road.
He’s torn my jacket.

1598
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:39,400
Hit me right on the nose.

1599
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:42,480
What was it he was saying?
Washed his shirt.

1600

A real artist.

We could be riding like him now.

02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:09,600
He’s torn my jacket…

I hate writing those explanatory notes.

1614
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:31,160
The tired-out tender sun

1615
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:35,720
To the sea bade its farewell…
