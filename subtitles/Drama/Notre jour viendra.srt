{24369}{24419}I loved it.
{24530}{24593}They were scared shitless.
{24637}{24710}You have the Submissive Syndrome.
{24885}{24918}What's that?
{24921}{24974}If a boy grows up|among too many women,
{24977}{25011}If nobody has listened to him,
{25014}{25082}he becomes submissive or,|95% of the time, a faggot.

{28892}{28969}Exactly. It's all about respect.
{28980}{29051}- What?|- We just do our job.
{29139}{29158}Yeah.

{31041}{31132}No problem. Take your time.|There's no pressure here.
{31135}{31182}Anyway, here are the sedans.
{31185}{31246}Family models... sports cars...
{31249}{31317}And some gorgeous French cars.

{32837}{32888}3.18 injection.
{32935}{32981}Hot stuff!
{33039}{33119}So it's a choice between|the BMW of a towel-head
{33122}{33166}the Porsche of a hairdresser

{36197}{36263}The worst was 11th grade.
{36272}{36349}One kid turned everyone against me.
{36369}{36462}Once at a party,|when I stood up to dance,
{36551}{36607}they all sat down.
{36642}{36695}It was his doing.
{36721}{36789}They found me in the bathroom.
{36843}{36903}They pinned me down.
{36935}{37010}Those assholes pissed in my hair.
{37121}{37190}His name was Barnabé Joubert.
{37471}{37533}"My hair bothers you?

{37610}{37652}My exploits,
{37655}{37720}my attitudes disturb you?
{37744}{37807}Then I'll intensify them.
{37826}{37906}And when,|under your torrential sarcasm,
{37909}{37987}I remain indifferent before you,
{38015}{38090}and I can finally be my true self,
{38099}{38158}despite the disgust,
{38161}{38218}despite the shame,
{38230}{38286}despite all that,
{38299}{38351}you will love me
{38354}{38411}for what I am."
{38844}{38903}Think they'll come?
{39040}{39070}Shit.
{39073}{39149}What the fuck!|They're not alone.
{39168}{39219}She brought a dragon.
