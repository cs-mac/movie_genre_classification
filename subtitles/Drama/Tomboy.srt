1
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,869
- Everything OK up there?
- Yep.

2
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:18,910
We stay to the left?

3
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:20,702
No, to the right.

4
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,119
Not that far right.

5
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,910
There you go.

6
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,244
We keep going straight?

7
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,702
No, we turn right.

8
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,077
Blinker on.

9
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,035
Up or down?

10
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,369
To the right.

11
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,702
Thataway.

12
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,119
Go on, put the blinker on.

13
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:01,369
- Which way?
- Right!

14
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:02,744
Up or down?

15
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,077
Up.

16
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:08,244
Your call.

17
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,910
Turn, turn, turn.

18
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:13,535
Straighten it up!

19
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:20,827
It's really nice, you'll see.

20
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,869
You'll tell me what you think?

21
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,494
Just pretending!

22
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,869
I knew it!

23
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:22,160
You like my room?

24
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,827
Yeah...

25
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:27,702
Know what? Yesterday Mum and I
had a picnic in the living-room

26
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:29,327
cos there was no table!

27
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,160
Well, we went out!

28
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:33,160
And guess what? I didn't have a bath.

29
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,577
I can tell - you stink!

30
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,202
No way, I don't!

31
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:39,577
- You do.
- No, I don't!

32
00:04:39,703 --> 00:04:41,869
- Yeah, you do!
- No, I don't!

33
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:48,494
Look what I've found...
a little cuddly stinky toy!

34
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,702
- You OK, my sweetie?
- Yes.

35
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:53,827
But you’re crushing my foot!

36
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,452
- Did you have a nice sleep last night?
- Yeah.

37
00:04:57,578 --> 00:04:58,744
In your new home?

38
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,202
Good.

39
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:05,535
All your cuddly toys and all...

40
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,285
Oh, there you are!

41
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:10,869
- You OK?
- Yeah.

42
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:12,202
- I missed you.
- Me too.

43
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,994
- Did you have a nice trip?
- Yeah, OK.

44
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,577
- Not too long?
- All right.

45
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:19,619
- How about the house?
- It's nice, I like it.

46
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,077
I like it too.

47
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:24,744
My room is lovely.

48
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,494
Did you see the blue walls?
Just the way you wanted.

49
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,285
Look what I found!

50
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,577
Dad found my cuddly toy!

51
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,244
I'm glad you found it,
it was mayhem!

52
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,785
It was all the way under the couch.

53
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,827
I will stop by in the afternoon.

54
00:05:56,953 --> 00:06:00,869
I was on the phone with the guys.
They're overloaded.

55
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,369
It's gonna be a bit messy at first.

56
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:17,327
- I can't do that!
- You can't?

57
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,035
- It's easy.
- For you, it is.

58
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:21,327
You do like this...

59
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:25,202
- Did you tell them about the baby?
- Oh, yeah, I told them.

60
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:27,410
I should be able to take a week off.

61
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:32,285
That's why at first
it's gonna be a bit tough but...

62
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:34,869
We should take them out.

63
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,869
- I'm gonna take them to the woods.
- Could we go tomorrow?

64
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:44,285
Well, tomorrow I'm working but...
we could go this weekend.

65
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:45,702
Will Mum come along?

66
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,035
No, Mum won't come,
she has to stay in bed for now.

67
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,410
Or the baby could "slip off".

68
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,410
Exactly...

69
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:57,035
Cheer up, honey, it's almost over, huh?

70
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,119
27, 28, 29,

71
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:11,619
40, 41, 42, 43,

72
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,869
45, 46, 47, 48...

73
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:16,410
49,

74
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,285
56, 57...

75
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:30,535
Stop it!

76
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,160
- I’ll pull your hair!
- If you pull my hair, I'll pull yours.

77
00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:48,285
Let go.

78
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:49,994
You let go of my hands!

79
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,619
Hey! What's all the racket?
Settle down!

80
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,869
"Suddenly there was a grunt...

81
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:02,119
then a melody arose in the jungle:

82
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:06,952
'do bee do bee do bee
do bee do bee do'..

83
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:10,410
Mowgli's eyes opened wide and gaped.

84
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,577
The buffalo stepped to the left

85
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:19,410
and an enormous,
shaggy-haired bear appeared...

86
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:23,952
Immediately, his brown glowing eyes
fixed upon Mowgli."

87
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:25,910
Are you looking for the others?

88
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,452
I noticed you looking at them.

89
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,035
They already left.

90
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,202
Are you new around here?

91
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,827
Yeah, we got in yesterday.

92
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,910
I'm Lisa. I live here.

93
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:48,869
You're shy.

94
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:50,369
No, I'm not.

95
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:52,035
Won’t you tell me your name?

96
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:56,660
Mickäel, my name is Mickäel.

97
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,244
Hey!

98
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,952
- Hi.
- Hi.

99
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,285
This is Mickäel,
the new boy from building C.

100
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,327
- Can we join you?
- We already made teams.

101
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,452
It's fine. I'll join one of the teams,
and he'll join the other one.

102
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,119
OK.

103
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,410
Run!

104
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,702
You're tagged!

105
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,660
I'll get my revenge!

106
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,660
Go on!

107
00:11:23,036 --> 00:11:26,660
Winner, loser.

108
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,035
Winner, loser...

109
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:35,702
Go on, run!

110
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,285
Five!

111
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:02,827
Come on, Lisa!

112
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,327
I'll let you take it, but only
so your team will like you.

113
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:24,994
- I got it!
- Yeah, cool!

114
00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:37,535
A young girl falls in love
with a boy who plays rock'n'roll,

115
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:40,494
at the end of the school day,

116
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,327
all the girls are wearing make-up,

117
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:46,244
the boys are getting bored,

118
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,660
the two twin sisters are squabbling...

119
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:51,035
Hello, madam.

120
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:53,535
Hello.

121
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:56,327
What's your name?

122
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:57,494
Jacqueline.

123
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,577
And what age are you?

124
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:01,744
35 years old, I think.

125
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,869
People say you're a star.

126
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:06,702
Yeah, it's true. I'm a renowned star.

127
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,744
And how do you feel about it?

128
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,785
I don't really know...

129
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:13,660
You don’t feel anything?

130
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:14,827
Almost nothing.

131
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:22,619
Hello!

132
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:24,119
Good morning...

133
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:25,702
Who are you?

134
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:31,160
Help us find the Smurfs' village.

135
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,535
It's right back there.

136
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:35,327
- Who is this?
- It's not a Smurf!

137
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:37,452
Oh, it's the dinosaur that...

138
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:39,702
Don't forget to wash your hair!

139
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:47,744
It's hurting my eyes.

140
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,369
Did it get into your eyes?

141
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,535
Is it all right now?
Still in?

142
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:53,744
No, it's fine.

143
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,244
My turn now.

144
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:05,035
It's gonna fall down.
It'll look beautiful!

145
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,494
There you go!

146
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:15,410
Tell me if it's too hot.

147
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:17,619
It's fine.

148
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:19,619
Close your eyes.

149
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,535
Come on out.
You've been there nearly an hour!

150
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,660
It must be freezing cold.

151
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,452
You'll catch a cold.

152
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,785
Jeanne, look at your finger tips.
If this goes on, it'll stay like this forever.

153
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:37,035
- I don't care
- Exactly, neither do I.

154
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:39,077
Come on, on your feet.

155
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:49,535
- Did you rinse your hair?
- Yeah...

156
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:53,827
Laure, get out of the bath!

157
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:22,160
Can you hear him?

158
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:23,327
No.

159
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:25,994
Maybe he's asleep.

160
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,285
Maybe he's dead.

161
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:29,994
What a nerve!

162
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,160
Here, look...

163
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,827
Can you feel that?

164
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,035
Here?

165
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,994
What is this thing?

166
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,827
Jeanne made it all on her own
this afternoon. Nice, isn't it?

167
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:45,119
I can make one for you too.

168
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,910
How about your afternoon?

169
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,494
I went out to play.

170
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,327
You went out without telling me?

171
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:54,119
- I didn’t want to bother you.
- I'd rather you tell me.

172
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,244
OK.

173
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,910
- Did you make any friends?
- A girlfriend.

174
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,285
Is that so?

175
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:02,410
Great! You're always hanging out
with the boys...

176
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:03,494
Yeah...

177
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,494
- What's her name?
- Lisa.

178
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,952
Will you take me along?

179
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:09,452
No, you're too little. Move over.

180
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:11,910
Easy, girls.

181
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:24,910
What are you telling him?

182
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:26,160
A secret.

183
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,952
I hope he'll tell me.

184
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:06,577
So, how's the room?

185
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:07,869
Good.

186
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:09,494
- You like it?
- Yeah.

187
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,119
I've got something for you.

188
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,827
This way you can come and go freely.

189
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:21,369
Keep them around your neck
so you don't lose them.

190
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,160
Thank you.

191
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:35,660
"Truth or dare"?

192
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:38,035
Come on!

193
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:41,577
We already played that three days ago!

194
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,619
- No big deal. We'll play it again.
- We're fed up!

195
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:46,160
Plus you're not the one in charge!

196
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:47,327
Is that so?

197
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:50,327
Let's play football.

198
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,160
Oh, no! Not football!

199
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:54,160
It's so boring.

200
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:58,077
You should play the cheerleader!

201
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:02,202
Look how cute he is.

202
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:05,744
Right, it's your go now, ask!

203
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,119
Are you in love with Lisa
right here?

204
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:17,785
"Lisa right here."

205
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,869
Wait! I wanna know the answer.

206
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:26,494
I know what you're going to say.

207
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,785
Yes.

208
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:34,494
A little kiss.

209
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:43,535
Are we playing or what?
Truth or dare?

210
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,660
Truth.

211
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:50,869
Have you ever...

212
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:54,369
eaten your snot?

213
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,702
No!

214
00:19:56,786 --> 00:19:58,619
- Not even when you were little?
- No!

215
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:01,952
- You're lying!
- OK, when I was little I did.

216
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,660
Have you ever tasted your pee?

217
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:10,869
- You pig!
- Go on, admit it.

218
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,160
You pig!

219
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:15,244
At least tell me what it tastes like...

220
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,244
It's salty.

221
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:21,410
How many girls have you kissed?

222
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:23,369
I've stopped counting.

223
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:26,702
Your turn now. Truth or dare?

224
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,119
Dare!

225
00:20:28,953 --> 00:20:32,160
You have to swap chewing gums
with Mickäel.

226
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:43,244
Chew, chew...

227
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,035
Go on, chew it!

228
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,702
Chew, chew...

229
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:52,952
OK, that's enough!

230
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:08,910
Leave it!

231
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,744
Hey, I'm here!

232
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:34,702
You're not playing?

233
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:37,035
No, I like to watch.

234
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:40,077
Me too.

235
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:44,160
Anyway, I don't have a choice. They don't
want me to play. They say I'm useless.

236
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,119
What's up?

237
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:17,827
Nothing...

238
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:20,285
You're not like the others.

239
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:27,619
Here, see...

240
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:45,577
Over here!

241
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,952
Can I play?

242
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:05,035
If you like...

243
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:07,535
- But you play on our side, OK?
- All right.

244
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:13,994
Here, take it.

245
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:27,035
What a shame...

246
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:33,827
Well played.

247
00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:26,160
Well played!

248
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:28,452
Nice game, Mickäel!

249
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:33,119
Mickäel!

250
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:39,327
- How's it going?
- All right.

251
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:40,577
Thirsty?

252
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:41,869
Thanks.

253
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,702
You're good.

254
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:48,577
Thanks.

255
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:57,077
Go on, stop him!

256
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:12,577
Mickäel, score!

257
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:13,744
Goal!

258
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:16,994
Well done, Mickäel!

259
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:21,035
Those who wanna
take a pee, over here!

260
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:27,327
Mickäel!

261
00:28:35,078 --> 00:28:37,119
Mickäel! Where are you?

262
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:40,702
He's over here.

263
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:42,660
He peed his pants!

264
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:46,119
Hey, guys!

265
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,202
Hey!

266
00:29:01,786 --> 00:29:03,119
You OK?

267
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,952
You're back early, huh?

268
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,994
Let's see... Watch out...

269
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:54,619
From the Giles the Farmer family,

270
00:29:54,745 --> 00:29:56,160
I want the son.

271
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,785
Pick a card.

272
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:09,577
From the Dough the Baker family,
I’d like to have...

273
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:13,452
the daughter.

274
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:16,494
Are you cheating or what?

275
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,619
What? You want to try?

276
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,619
I'm not allowed to...

277
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:34,369
One sip won't do any harm.

278
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:49,869
Can’t wait to see you play poker!

279
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:53,119
So, from the...

280
00:30:54,995 --> 00:30:56,910
Flower the Gardener family,

281
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:58,410
I'd like the grandfather.

282
00:30:58,536 --> 00:30:59,660
Pick a card.

283
00:31:03,203 --> 00:31:05,035
Damn, what a pick!

284
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:07,077
Family set!

285
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:17,244
Oh, sucking your thumb?

286
00:31:17,786 --> 00:31:20,285
What's going on?

287
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,660
Nothing.

288
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:23,577
You tired?

289
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,785
Come here.

290
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:37,952
I know it's hard moving
from house to house, hmm?

291
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:44,410
But this time we'll stay - a long time.

292
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,535
You'll see. It'll be nice.

293
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:55,410
Know what? I also used to suck my thumb
when I was little.

294
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:59,202
You'll see, when you grow up
and you try it again...

295
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:00,910
It's really weird.

296
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:02,869
It's no good anymore.

297
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:08,535
Hold on tight, little monkey.

298
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:40,452
Stop moving.

299
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:58,119
I'll do your eyes brown.

300
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,577
And then I'm gonna draw
some freckles on you...

301
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:09,577
on your forehead...

302
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,535
and on your nose,

303
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:14,827
and some on your chin.

304
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:32,035
Hey, I haven’t finished yet.

305
00:34:47,828 --> 00:34:48,869
Lisa...

306
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,744
- Lisa...
- Yes.

307
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,577
I'm coming.

308
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,452
Where are you?

309
00:35:03,578 --> 00:35:05,285
I'm down here.

310
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:16,744
You won't invite me in?

311
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,410
I can't. My mum's sleeping.

312
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,619
- You're sulking?
- No.

313
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,744
Why didn’t you show up?

314
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,869
I didn’t feel like it.

315
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,619
It's because of
what happened yesterday...

316
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:39,535
We can go to my place if you want.

317
00:35:45,995 --> 00:35:49,035
Go on. I don’t want to go
with the others either.

318
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:51,119
It'll be just me and you.

319
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:11,369
You look beautiful, see?

320
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:12,535
Yeah.

321
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:17,285
I'm gonna go.
I'm going to play at Lisa's house.

322
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:20,744
You said you'd stay with me!

323
00:36:21,036 --> 00:36:23,910
Yeah, but I didn't know
she'd invite me over.

324
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,244
Can I come, then?

325
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,494
No, you can't.

326
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,994
What time will you be back?

327
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,452
- I’m not sure. At around six.
- Make me a watch so that I know....

328
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:22,160
Come on, let's dance.

329
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,994
Come on!

330
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,285
What is that?

331
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,410
Let's put some make-up on.

332
00:39:07,536 --> 00:39:09,619
- What are we playing?
- Well, girls!

333
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:13,452
Close your eyes.

334
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:25,702
Tomorrow we’re going swimming
with the others.

335
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:29,035
I'm not sure I'll come.

336
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,369
You can open them now.

337
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,577
You can't swim? Is that it?

338
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:35,702
Of course I can.

339
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:47,077
Don't do too much...

340
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:13,327
It suits you!

341
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:20,910
You look great as a girl.

342
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:52,577
Laure?

343
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,577
Won’t you come and say hi?

344
00:40:56,828 --> 00:40:58,869
I need to do something first.

345
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:01,910
Oh, come on, come here!

346
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:11,494
Everything OK, sweetie?

347
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,619
You put some make-up on!

348
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:16,577
You look lovely.
It looks great on you.

349
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:19,452
It really does.

350
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:05,369
What are you doing?

351
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:07,577
Clay modelling.

352
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,994
Will you make me some spaghetti?

353
00:43:13,453 --> 00:43:16,035
- I don’t want to.
- Please...

354
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:31,327
Can you pass me the purple thingy?

355
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,035
What are you making?

356
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:42,369
Something.

357
00:43:43,661 --> 00:43:45,910
Will you help me?

358
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:48,660
Hang on...

359
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:50,869
It's fine.

360
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,869
What are you making?

361
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:14,910
None of your business.

362
00:44:17,328 --> 00:44:20,035
What are you making?

363
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:23,202
I already told you, I'm not telling.

364
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:27,827
That's not very nice of you.

365
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:18,869
Come on, you guys!

366
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:04,494
You’re just a bunch of cowards.

367
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,785
Come on! Let's put on a battle!

368
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:11,827
Come on, then.

369
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:21,577
Come on, Mickäel!

370
00:46:34,578 --> 00:46:36,994
So aren’t you gonna get back at him?

371
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,369
Go on!

372
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:42,160
Come on!

373
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:46,452
Push, push!

374
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:49,702
Yeah! There you go!

375
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:51,244
Go on, Mickäel!

376
00:46:54,328 --> 00:46:55,910
Go on, push!

377
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:02,744
Yeah!

378
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,452
Can I open my eyes?

379
00:47:54,578 --> 00:47:55,994
No.

380
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,202
Mickäel! I'll get my revenge!

381
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:04,369
Hi.

382
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:05,577
Is Mickäel in?

383
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,410
No one's in. I'm all alone.

384
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:10,494
You're Jeanne, right?

385
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,535
Who are you?

386
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:15,577
Lisa. He must have mentioned me.

387
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:18,285
Yes.

388
00:50:22,745 --> 00:50:24,702
OK, so... bye.

389
00:50:24,828 --> 00:50:26,869
Bye.

390
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,327
Hi, sweetie.
What are you doing there?

391
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:57,744
Bored? Is that it?

392
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,202
No, it's not that.

393
00:50:59,328 --> 00:51:01,577
We took a little longer,
it was really crowded.

394
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,160
Lisa came looking for you.

395
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:12,619
She came looking for Mickäel.

396
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:16,327
Why are you doing this?

397
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:17,952
I'm not doing anything.

398
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,535
You pretend to be a boy.

399
00:51:22,661 --> 00:51:24,369
Shut up!

400
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:27,244
- I'll tell Mummy.
- No, you won't.

401
00:51:42,453 --> 00:51:47,160
If I bring you along, you won't say a word?
I’ll bring you every day, deal?

402
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,452
What's your name?

403
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,660
Jeanne. And yours?

404
00:52:04,786 --> 00:52:06,952
My name is Cheyenne.

405
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:08,494
That's a lovely name.

406
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,077
And how old are you?

407
00:52:11,078 --> 00:52:12,910
Six.

408
00:52:13,036 --> 00:52:15,785
I'm five and a half years old.

409
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,160
Really?

410
00:52:19,286 --> 00:52:22,077
And what year will you be in?

411
00:52:22,203 --> 00:52:23,327
In year one.

412
00:52:23,453 --> 00:52:26,452
Oh, me too. We'll go to the same school.

413
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:30,285
It's really nice, you know?
I've already checked it out.

414
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:34,160
I haven't. Do you know
what the teacher is called?

415
00:52:34,286 --> 00:52:37,035
Yeah, she's called Sylvie.

416
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:40,619
And what do your parents do?

417
00:52:40,745 --> 00:52:42,827
Daddy works on the computer

418
00:52:42,953 --> 00:52:46,994
and Mummy doesn't work
cos she's got a big tummy.

419
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,702
Cos she's "prenant".

420
00:52:49,245 --> 00:52:50,952
Do you have a brother or sister?

421
00:52:51,078 --> 00:52:52,494
A big sister.

422
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,952
I have a big brother,
which is better.

423
00:52:56,078 --> 00:52:57,744
Why is it better?

424
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,202
Cos a big brother can protect you.

425
00:53:04,203 --> 00:53:09,410
You know, once, my brother fought
some boys that were bullying me.

426
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:13,952
He punched them really hard
cos they were rude to me.

427
00:53:16,036 --> 00:53:20,202
That was in our old home. He was
the strongest boy in the neighbourhood.

428
00:53:20,328 --> 00:53:22,619
Everyone was scared of him

429
00:53:22,745 --> 00:53:24,410
and all the girls loved him.

430
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:28,160
But he didn't care about
anyone else but me.

431
00:53:29,578 --> 00:53:30,952
Hi, Jeanne.

432
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:38,452
You see? I came along with my brother.

433
00:54:32,078 --> 00:54:35,119
Don't cut it too short
or Mum will notice.

434
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:38,744
And cut it straight!

435
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,869
Yeah, I'm not a moron.

436
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:45,744
When I grow up
I want to be a hairdresser.

437
00:54:54,786 --> 00:54:56,035
What are you doing?

438
00:54:57,411 --> 00:54:59,285
Hello, madam.

439
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,869
- You want one?
- Yes.

440
00:55:15,203 --> 00:55:16,785
Nice to meet you.

441
00:55:16,911 --> 00:55:18,827
Nice to meet you too.

442
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:30,619
Remember, not a word at dinner.

443
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:34,077
You say nothing.
Mouth shut all the way. OK?

444
00:55:35,578 --> 00:55:37,535
No slipping, hear me?

445
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:43,244
Come on, Jeanne. It'll get cold.

446
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:44,910
You're not hungry?

447
00:55:48,286 --> 00:55:50,910
You've been running around
all day, haven't you?

448
00:55:54,036 --> 00:55:56,202
She went outwith Laure today.

449
00:55:56,328 --> 00:55:58,952
Is that right? That's good.

450
00:55:59,078 --> 00:56:00,119
What did you do?

451
00:56:06,578 --> 00:56:08,035
Did you have fun?

452
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:09,619
Yes.

453
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:11,660
Just "Yes"?
Cat got your tongue?

454
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:13,452
Go on, show me.

455
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,244
What a relief!

456
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,410
We had a water fight.

457
00:56:19,161 --> 00:56:20,160
That's funny.

458
00:56:20,286 --> 00:56:24,035
Yeah, I even frightened some off
cos I was too good.

459
00:56:24,745 --> 00:56:26,702
That's nice of Laure's friends
to play with you.

460
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:32,660
Yeah, but my favourite one is Mickäel.

461
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:37,285
One of Laure's friends.

462
00:56:37,411 --> 00:56:40,785
He played with me,
carried me on his back,

463
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:43,369
and now he is my friend too.

464
00:57:12,411 --> 00:57:15,244
Finally, the class lists are up at school.

465
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:17,244
I went to check them out.

466
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,452
Are you sure you're in year six?

467
00:57:21,578 --> 00:57:22,660
Yeah...

468
00:57:23,536 --> 00:57:24,619
I didn't see your name.

469
00:57:30,703 --> 00:57:33,327
Weird, cos there's only one class.

470
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:38,119
Well, maybe I haven't
been registered yet

471
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:40,869
cos we just moved in.

472
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:45,119
It would be so cool
if we were together.

473
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,327
Yeah, it'd be cool.

474
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:07,369
It's nothing, it's nothing.

475
00:58:11,786 --> 00:58:13,577
You OK? What happened?

476
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:14,827
She fell.

477
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:17,744
No, she didn't. He pushed her.

478
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,910
- Him?
- Yeah, him.

479
00:58:21,703 --> 00:58:22,994
Why did you push my sister?

480
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,910
She won't stop following me around.
She's a pain!

481
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,535
Go on!

482
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:03,827
Kick him! Kick him!

483
00:59:04,953 --> 00:59:07,119
Go on, get him down!

484
00:59:09,328 --> 00:59:10,619
There you go!

485
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,327
Let go!

486
00:59:33,161 --> 00:59:34,369
Does it sting?

487
00:59:34,495 --> 00:59:36,744
No. I'm brave.

488
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:41,619
Want a plaster?

489
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,785
Yeah...

490
00:59:43,578 --> 00:59:46,827
You were great when you hit him.

491
00:59:46,953 --> 00:59:51,119
Well, you clench your fists,
you close your eyes,

492
00:59:51,245 --> 00:59:52,202
then you strike.

493
00:59:52,328 --> 00:59:53,369
It's easy.

494
01:00:31,203 --> 01:00:32,410
Good evening, madam.

495
01:00:32,536 --> 01:00:33,744
Good evening.

496
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:36,327
- What is that?
- Don't know.

497
01:00:38,036 --> 01:00:40,410
I saw him come in and...

498
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:43,327
Well, he says
he picked a fight in the woods.

499
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,369
I don’t follow...

500
01:00:46,495 --> 01:00:47,827
That's what happened.

501
01:00:47,953 --> 01:00:49,494
I don't understand.

502
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,494
He told me your son did this to him.

503
01:00:52,078 --> 01:00:53,910
You must be mistaken...

504
01:00:54,036 --> 01:00:56,577
It was him, Mickäel.

505
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:06,077
Yes, it's true. It was me.

506
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,077
I'm awfully sorry, madam.

507
01:01:15,286 --> 01:01:17,452
I'll do what needs to be done.

508
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:20,077
I'll punish him.

509
01:01:21,078 --> 01:01:23,744
- Apologise.
- I’m sorry.

510
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,785
- It won’t happen again.
- It won’t happen again.

511
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,285
Thank you. Goodbye.

512
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:41,285
What did you do, Laure?

513
01:01:41,745 --> 01:01:43,494
What did you do?!

514
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,369
Why did you do that?

515
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:47,119
I don't know.

516
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,202
Come here!

517
01:01:48,328 --> 01:01:50,535
You told everybody you were a boy?

518
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:53,160
You lied and you dragged
your sister into it?!

519
01:01:53,286 --> 01:01:54,952
Why did you do that?!

520
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:06,952
Go to your room!

521
01:02:36,203 --> 01:02:38,869
Don't blame Mum, you know.

522
01:02:57,786 --> 01:03:00,327
Don't be upset,
it'll be all right.

523
01:03:01,453 --> 01:03:02,660
It'll work out fine.

524
01:03:02,786 --> 01:03:05,077
It's all over now.

525
01:03:05,203 --> 01:03:08,285
We need to leave. Please.

526
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:05,119
Got one.

527
01:04:08,453 --> 01:04:10,077
Is it a woman?

528
01:04:10,203 --> 01:04:11,327
No.

529
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:14,744
- A man?
- Yes.

530
01:04:16,245 --> 01:04:17,994
Do we know him for real?

531
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,452
No.

532
01:04:23,453 --> 01:04:25,994
- Is he on the telly?
- Yes.

533
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,410
Do we like him?

534
01:04:30,536 --> 01:04:32,119
Not really.

535
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,077
Is he handsome?

536
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:38,369
No.

537
01:04:41,828 --> 01:04:43,369
Has he got any hair?

538
01:04:43,495 --> 01:04:44,660
No.

539
01:04:45,828 --> 01:04:47,660
Is he in a TV show?

540
01:04:50,328 --> 01:04:51,660
No.

541
01:04:52,203 --> 01:04:53,744
I know. He's in an advert.

542
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,827
Yes.

543
01:04:54,953 --> 01:04:56,869
The fat man in the pasta advert?

544
01:04:56,995 --> 01:04:58,452
Yep.

545
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,119
Sweetie?

546
01:05:29,245 --> 01:05:30,410
Jeanne...

547
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,827
Wake up. Go to your bed, OK?

548
01:05:36,953 --> 01:05:38,452
Come on...

549
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:45,952
Go to your room.

550
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,869
Laure?

551
01:06:02,453 --> 01:06:04,994
Come on, up,
you've got to get dressed.

552
01:06:24,995 --> 01:06:26,619
No, you're wearing this.

553
01:06:26,745 --> 01:06:29,869
- Oh, no, I don’t want to.
- No arguing, put it on.

554
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:33,660
Here you go.

555
01:06:58,078 --> 01:06:59,702
Come on, we're going.

556
01:07:02,495 --> 01:07:03,160
Where to?

557
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:04,577
- That boy you hit? His place.
- No.

558
01:07:04,703 --> 01:07:05,785
- Yes.
- I'm not coming.

559
01:07:05,911 --> 01:07:07,035
Stop that. Enough!

560
01:07:07,161 --> 01:07:08,660
I don’t want to go!

561
01:07:08,786 --> 01:07:09,869
No!

562
01:07:09,995 --> 01:07:11,619
I've had it now.
You're coming!

563
01:07:11,745 --> 01:07:13,494
- Let go!
- Enough!

564
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:16,619
Jeanne, stop that. Leave your sister alone.
You let go of that arm.

565
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:18,494
Come here now!

566
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:20,744
Shut the door, Jeanne.

567
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,660
Shut the door!

568
01:07:33,911 --> 01:07:35,869
Good morning.

569
01:07:37,786 --> 01:07:39,410
We've come to apologise, again.

570
01:07:39,536 --> 01:07:41,369
There's no need to.

571
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:45,994
It's kind of complicated, actually.

572
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,577
- We're not heading back home?
- No.

573
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,452
- Where are we going to?
- To your friend Lisa's place.

574
01:08:26,578 --> 01:08:29,494
- No!
- What is your plan, then?

575
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:32,327
Are you going to pretend
to be a boy all year?

576
01:08:32,453 --> 01:08:36,285
School starts in two weeks' time.
We have no choice. We need to tell.

577
01:08:41,453 --> 01:08:43,160
Listen.

578
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:47,244
I'm not doing this to hurt you,
or to teach you a lesson.

579
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:49,452
I have to, understand?

580
01:08:51,703 --> 01:08:54,077
I don't mind you playing "the boy".

581
01:08:54,953 --> 01:08:56,952
It doesn't even make me sad.

582
01:08:58,661 --> 01:09:00,744
But this can't go on.

583
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:04,202
Got an idea? Cos if you do,
please say so, I can't think of any.

584
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:10,660
Have you got a solution?

585
01:09:39,828 --> 01:09:41,035
Good morning.

586
01:09:41,161 --> 01:09:42,827
Excuse me, is Lisa home?

587
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:44,785
She'll be home any minute now.

588
01:09:44,911 --> 01:09:47,702
Would you mind if we wait for her?

589
01:09:47,828 --> 01:09:49,035
What's going on?

590
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:51,827
Nothing serious.
I'll explain to you but...

591
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:53,535
Come in.

592
01:10:23,911 --> 01:10:24,869
Lisa?

593
01:10:24,995 --> 01:10:26,952
- Yes?
- Come here.

594
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,702
This is Mickäel's mum.

595
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:36,410
She's come here to say Mickäel

596
01:10:36,536 --> 01:10:39,869
is not actually Mickäel but a girl,
not a boy.

597
01:10:41,245 --> 01:10:44,327
She's waiting for you in the kitchen.

598
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:17,744
Hey! You know what?
Mickäel is a girl!

599
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,744
She came to my house
and was wearing a dress.

600
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:23,410
Are you joking or what?

601
01:14:38,661 --> 01:14:40,744
He's over there. Let's go!

602
01:15:14,245 --> 01:15:16,452
We've heard you're a girl.

603
01:15:19,078 --> 01:15:20,660
We're gonna check that.

604
01:15:22,453 --> 01:15:23,952
Stop it!

605
01:15:24,661 --> 01:15:25,994
What do you think you're doing?

606
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,660
We're gonna check
if she's really a girl.

607
01:15:27,786 --> 01:15:28,869
Leave him alone.

608
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:31,410
You're right. It's you who'll check.

609
01:15:31,536 --> 01:15:32,785
No.

610
01:15:33,828 --> 01:15:36,827
If she's a girl, then you kissed her.
It's disgusting.

611
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:39,327
Right?

612
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,785
Yes, it's disgusting.

613
01:15:45,911 --> 01:15:47,952
Then you're gonna do it.

614
01:16:54,286 --> 01:16:57,327
Laure, don't you want to
go and play outside?

615
01:16:57,453 --> 01:16:59,452
I'd rather stay here.

616
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:02,160
Tomorrow you go back to school.

617
01:17:02,286 --> 01:17:03,869
That's all right.

618
01:17:18,536 --> 01:17:20,369
He's waking up.

619
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,994
Oh my, oh my...
Not easy waking up, huh?

620
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,702
Oh my...

621
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:49,202
Easy...

622
01:19:23,536 --> 01:19:26,077
What's your name?

623
01:19:31,453 --> 01:19:33,452
My name is Laure.
