1
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,347
Kyoto, 1865

2
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:20,996
After moving
to the Nishi Honganji Temple,

3
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:23,506
the Shinsen militia was recruiting.

4
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:26,338
In the beginning,

5
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:29,845
they drew most of their troops

6
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:32,212
from several regional dojos.

7
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:35,184
But this yielded dubious results.

8
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:37,220
Now men were handpicked.

9
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:55,064
Next!

10
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,584
Who's the boy?

11
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:11,314
Him?

12
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:13,084
A merchant's son.

13
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,660
Not a spy?

14
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:21,289
He was recommended by his master,

15
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:26,200
Senzaemon Hamano
of the Shingyoto school.

16
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:28,670
He was his assistant

17
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,604
after graduating.

18
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,574
His background?

19
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:35,111
His family

20
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:38,376
are the Echigoya's,
textile dealers.

21
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:40,542
He's their third son.

22
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,119
Name?

23
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:44,651
Sozaburo Kano.

24
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,616
Soji has his hands full.

25
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:53,293
I have his family tree.

26
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:58,068
The Echiyoga family
is from minokano.

27
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:02,571
In the service of lnaba
during the civil wars.

28
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:07,008
Utanosuke Kano, notably,
was an outstanding warrior.

29
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:13,309
His descendants went to Echigo,
then Kyoto.

30
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:20,714
In spite of their change in class,

31
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:23,191
they kept the samurai name, Kano.

32
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:24,990
Look.

33
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:51,483
He's the last one.

34
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:54,183
His name is Hyozo Tashiro.

35
00:04:56,594 --> 00:05:00,860
He's from the Kurume clan,
and the Hokushin Itto school.

36
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:05,697
He was recommended
by our man Shinohara.

37
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:09,499
Like Kano,
he fought his way through

38
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:12,770
all the early rounds undefeated.

39
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,905
Okita won, but he had
a run for his money.

40
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:55,252
Only those two are worthy.

41
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,989
What do you think, Hijikata?

42
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,123
Kano and Tashiro.

43
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,456
Fine.

44
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:07,894
And you, Ito?

45
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,933
I agree.

46
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:14,964
I don't think
we should be judging them

47
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,973
on swordsmanship only.

48
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:19,942
But since that's your policy...

49
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:24,407
The Shinsen militia
must put down uprisings.

50
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:29,344
Kano, Tashiro.

51
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,445
To the Commander's quarters.

52
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:53,772
There are no subordinates here.

53
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,311
Come closer.

54
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,574
Kano, how old are you?

55
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,574
Eighteen.

56
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,870
Eighteen?

57
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:32,807
Don't lie to us.

58
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,680
What's the difference?

59
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:40,186
Well... he doesn't often
react like that.

60
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:43,521
He doesn't have that leaning.

61
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:47,728
You assisted your master?

62
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,294
I'm a novice.

63
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,699
No, you surprised me out there.

64
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,862
You've got talent.

65
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,672
You're Tashiro?

66
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:11,548
These are troubled times.

67
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:16,787
I expect you to maintain order,
at any price.

68
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:26,169
I'd like to take Kano as my aide.

69
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:30,466
Fine. That's the custom.

70
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:33,207
And Tashiro?

71
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:40,145
Let's assign him to the First Unit,
under Okita.

72
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:41,684
They'll break him in.

73
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:42,980
Fine.

74
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:47,183
Tomorrow, Seijuro Muto
of the Fourth Unit

75
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,260
is to be executed.

76
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:54,323
One of them could take care of it.

77
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,057
Toshi,

78
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,870
why not Kano?

79
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,939
CODE OF CONDUCT

80
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:10,745
NEVER BETRAY THE SAMURAI WAYS

81
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:14,582
NEVER DESERT THE SHINSEN MILITIA

82
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:18,919
NEVER BORROW MONEY

83
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,258
NEVER BE INVOLVED IN CIVIL SUITS

84
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:27,095
NEVER FIGHT FOR PERSONAL MOTIVES

85
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:31,023
ANYONE VIOLATlNG THIS CODE

86
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,195
MUST DISEMBOWEL HIMSELF

87
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:51,143
Kano.

88
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,250
Yes?

89
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:55,055
Tomorrow morning at 8,

90
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,151
a man from the Fourth Unit,

91
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:02,760
Seijiro Muto,
guilty of borrowing money

92
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:06,530
and passing it off
as a loan to the militia,

93
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:08,764
will be beheaded.

94
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:11,239
You will perform the execution.

95
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:13,369
- Understood?
- Yes.

96
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:19,049
If you don't know how,
ask someone.

97
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,814
Shinohara will be observing.

98
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,683
I'm honored.

99
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,161
That's how they test newcomers.

100
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:38,599
Why you? Why not me?

101
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:44,901
Their code of conduct is fine.

102
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,005
But their code of battle...

103
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,315
When a captain falls in battle,

104
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,914
his men must follow him
to the grave.

105
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:01,447
Absurd. One life isn't enough.

106
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:06,387
They put that in after
the Imperial Palace battle.

107
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:14,231
Why did you join?

108
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,431
Kano...

109
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,698
Can't you sleep?

110
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:57,578
Without sleep,
you can't perform tomorrow.

111
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:30,443
Have you ever killed a man?

112
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,718
Have you ever made love?

113
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:10,605
He must've killed before.

114
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:12,414
Forgive me.

115
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,879
He's got courage.

116
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:21,424
No, something other than courage.

117
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,590
Who's there?

118
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,160
Tashiro. I enlisted yesterday.

119
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:34,067
I was jealous of Kano,
who enlisted along with me.

120
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:35,968
I came to watch.

121
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:39,372
Executions are not open
to the public.

122
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,968
I submit to your punishment.

123
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,842
Five days detention.

124
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:03,963
FIVE DAYS LATER

125
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:23,245
It's over. Back to your unit.

126
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:27,417
Should I apologize to someone?
To the Commander?

127
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,459
lt'll keep until tomorrow.

128
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,000
Tashiro.

129
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,907
Sozaburo.

130
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:53,012
In my cell, I kept calling you.

131
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:55,241
For help?

132
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:58,554
No. I called my true love's name.

133
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:00,981
Are you cross?

134
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:04,991
Why are you smiling?

135
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:10,055
Did you miss me?
I'll come to you tonight.

136
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:16,801
- Don't you like me?
- Excuse me.

137
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:51,604
Cry out?
Or shall I do it for you?

138
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,803
I don't want to die
without making love to you.

139
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:58,808
move away.

140
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:04,348
In that case,
I'll take you to Gion.

141
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:08,781
- Gion?
- If you prefer women.

142
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,758
I don't prefer women.

143
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:15,957
Haven't you ever known a woman?

144
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:20,066
NO SECRETS ON HEAVEN AND EARTH
EVERYONE KNOWS IT

145
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:24,636
WITHIN A MONTH

146
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:31,946
RUMORS

147
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:35,547
KANO'S NEVER HAD A WOMAN

148
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,962
SOME MEN ARE COURTING HIM

149
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,130
NOTABLY,

150
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:56,868
FIFTH UNIT LEADER,
CAPTAIN TAKEDA

151
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,881
AND TASHIRO,
WHO JOINED WITH HIM.

152
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:18,958
HE AVOlDS TASHlRO

153
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,165
STlLL, HE LIKES BEING
THE OBJECT OF DESIRE

154
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,765
AT 18, HE KEEPS HIS LONG LOCKS

155
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:31,030
A PROVOCATlON FOR ME
SENSITIVE TO HIS CHARMS

156
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:35,873
ONE MUST FEEL SORRY FOR TASHIRO

157
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:47,556
Soji.

158
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:53,720
What are you doing?

159
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:56,031
Playing with kids?

160
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,899
Yes, they're catching fish for me.

161
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:01,665
What for?

162
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:04,672
To eat.

163
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:11,236
Soji, how have you been feeling?

164
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:19,449
I was only sick
after the battle at Ikedaya.

165
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,218
About Tashiro and Kano...

166
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:29,055
Oh, that?

167
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:34,070
Not my cup of tea.
One man loving another...

168
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,435
During the entry contest,

169
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:44,746
who was stronger?

170
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,078
Sozaburo Kano.

171
00:19:58,328 --> 00:19:59,852
Hijikata.

172
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:04,134
What did he think, coming here?

173
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:07,236
Nothing, really.

174
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:10,097
He liked the smell.

175
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:15,076
The smell? The smell of blood?

176
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,610
During Ikedaya,

177
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:21,609
you were on watch.

178
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:28,420
You asked if the Choshu were crazy
for wanting to set Kyoto ablaze

179
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:31,619
and take the emperor captive,

180
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:33,825
to have him with them.

181
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:36,465
Did I really say that?

182
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,693
They're not crazy,
they're quite lucid.

183
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:46,168
Where high-spirited men gather,

184
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:50,972
arguing back and forth,
for days on end,

185
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:53,142
about illusions,

186
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:57,048
they come to believe
that the shogun

187
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:59,088
can be easily overthrown.

188
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:03,951
The militia is no less utopian.

189
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:10,095
It emanates a certain energy.
Young men are drawn to it.

190
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:14,296
It takes a madman
to know a madman.

191
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:18,173
And you're the leader of the pack.

192
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:39,360
Is Kano here?

193
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:46,663
Have a go?

194
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,204
I'm grateful for your guidance.

195
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:34,945
Enough.

196
00:22:38,455 --> 00:22:40,013
Tashiro.

197
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:47,528
Tashiro, don't hold back.

198
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,096
Very sloppy.

199
00:22:56,773 --> 00:23:00,265
Is that the work
of an expert swordsman?

200
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,319
match over.

201
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,960
Soji's right.

202
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:30,472
Tashiro is really
one notch below Kano.

203
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:36,068
You two fight.

204
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:29,755
That's strange.

205
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:04,559
Those two... are lovers.

206
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:08,894
No doubt about it.

207
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:18,902
BEFORE LONG,

208
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:21,581
RUMOR:

209
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:25,816
KANO AND TASHIRO ARE LOVERS

210
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,248
They're coming.
The militia is coming.

211
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:03,224
That's Commander Kondo!

212
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:14,634
The militia!

213
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:25,238
Thank you for protecting us.

214
00:26:28,518 --> 00:26:29,985
Thank you.

215
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:41,221
Sozaburo,

216
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:42,821
tell Toshi...

217
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,964
Tell the Lieut. Commander
to come see me.

218
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:08,017
I must go to Choshu.
Or rather Hiroshima.

219
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:10,324
For battle?

220
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:12,361
No, to testify against them.

221
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:15,495
What good will that do?

222
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,159
We have orders to invade them.

223
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:22,204
All clans must band together,
for financial reasons.

224
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,504
What are you doing there?

225
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:28,576
Testifying.

226
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:30,373
Tell me the truth.

227
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:37,715
Toshi,

228
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:41,557
I leave you in charge.

229
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:44,349
Who's leaving with you?

230
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:49,557
Ito, Takeda and Ogata, I think.

231
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:54,436
Ito?

232
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:57,932
Since his arrival,

233
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:01,036
he's spread unrest in the ranks.

234
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:05,081
In your absence,
I shall keep a tidy house.

235
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:10,943
I've heard

236
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:15,689
that Soza...
that Kano has taken a lover.

237
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:19,919
I wouldn't know.

238
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:25,030
What does it matter?
Are you worried?

239
00:28:25,735 --> 00:28:29,364
No, but this sort of thing
has happened before.

240
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,105
There was a lot of trouble
last year, during Ikedaya.

241
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:36,773
Hearts inflamed by passion.

242
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:41,007
It must not happen again.

243
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:57,295
Beautiful.

244
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:35,867
Are you with the militia?

245
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:37,332
Yes.

246
00:29:42,912 --> 00:29:44,379
From what school?

247
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:50,283
Pure Land Buddhist.

248
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:51,911
No, in swordsmanship?

249
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:54,656
Swordsmanship?

250
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:58,819
I'm from the same school
as Okita and Hijikata,

251
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:00,896
but I'm not very good.

252
00:30:00,997 --> 00:30:02,362
Actually, I'm terrible.

253
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:07,198
You're not a monk then?
You're with the militia?

254
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:09,697
That's right.

255
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,871
Please forgive me.

256
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:18,146
The look on Kondo's face!

257
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,450
Who was with him?

258
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,883
I'm not at liberty to say.

259
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:26,654
Captain Okita.

260
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,224
Don't call me captain.

261
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:33,219
How old was he?

262
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,730
About 60, I guess.

263
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:40,632
Are you joking?
Even Kondo is only about 30.

264
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:42,466
No one here is that old.

265
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:46,440
He said he was
from the same school as you.

266
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:49,876
I've got it. Genzaburo Inoue.

267
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:54,541
You should kill yourself
for such an affront.

268
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:58,018
He is our senior member,
but he's 43 or 44.

269
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,290
- You said 60.
- I'm sorry.

270
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:03,087
Forget it.

271
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:05,718
It's his own fault - he looks old.

272
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:08,297
What is his post?

273
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:10,730
He's captain of the Sixth Unit.

274
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:13,894
Commander Kondo,
Lieut. Commander Hijikata, old Inoue

275
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,904
and myself are from the same dojo.

276
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:19,804
and the Tennenrishin school.

277
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:24,403
Some say we have
a lock on the militia.

278
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:26,414
That's not our intention.

279
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:27,949
I understand.

280
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,319
It's true of course.
He's no good with a sword.

281
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:35,755
When you spar with him, go easy.

282
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:40,157
THIS ADVICE PROVED DIFFICULT
TO PUT INTO PRACTICE

283
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:51,064
You're the one
who asked my religion, right?

284
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:55,577
I inquired about
your swordsmanship training.

285
00:31:55,678 --> 00:31:58,806
I didn't know who you were.
Forgive me.

286
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:00,974
If you say so.

287
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:11,886
Little Religion!

288
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:16,256
I don't have time
to coach you now,

289
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:18,834
but we'll get to it soon.

290
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:20,425
Thank you.

291
00:32:23,373 --> 00:32:25,464
THEN, ONE DAY...

292
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:33,712
Little Religion!

293
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:36,912
Ready?

294
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:20,895
I'll show you.

295
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:47,480
Call that a samurai?

296
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:52,795
- Who are you?
- After them!

297
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:02,733
What happened?

298
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,773
I don't know.

299
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:10,238
Two of them. Dubious characters.

300
00:34:10,346 --> 00:34:13,372
They've got a nerve coming in here.

301
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:15,815
What did they say about us?

302
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:17,682
Call that a samurai?

303
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:19,311
Unforgivable.

304
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:21,117
Was that all?

305
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:25,422
Also, that's the best
the Shinsen can do?

306
00:34:25,528 --> 00:34:29,794
Our guards heard them,
but thought they were invited.

307
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:32,459
They let them go.

308
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:37,302
Long ago, people dared enter.

309
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:40,604
But now that we're
to maintain order,

310
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,941
no one should ever get inside!

311
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:48,108
I'm sorry.
Punish me as you see fit.

312
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:52,415
It's my fault.
Captain Inoue had no part in it.

313
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:58,783
Kano, don't lose your head.

314
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:01,693
Calm down and await orders.

315
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:04,426
Get back to work, all right?

316
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:09,096
One had a scar on his chin,

317
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:13,107
and a crest of three stars.

318
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:17,145
The other was about 25.
He had a strange crest -

319
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:19,510
crossed battle-axes.

320
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:24,652
Crossed battle-axes?
I haven't seen that often.

321
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:27,314
We're not certain,

322
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:30,017
but they may have Higo accents.

323
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,150
If they are from Higo,

324
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:35,890
they may want to avenge
their comrades from Ikedaya.

325
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:38,763
Find out.

326
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:40,460
Right away.

327
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:43,869
Whom did they see

328
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:47,670
sparring in the dojo
at that moment?

329
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:52,271
Captain Inoue and Sozaburo Kano.

330
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:56,318
They must've been mocking Kano,
for his inexperience.

331
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,132
Inoue.

332
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:15,361
Toshi.

333
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:18,764
Let your assistants
do that for you.

334
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,740
I do.

335
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:23,937
But I do it much better.

336
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:27,346
You must set an example
for your men.

337
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,781
You think so?

338
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:36,419
I wanted to speak to you,
about today's incident.

339
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:39,753
I'm sorry.

340
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:43,059
No, it's not your fault at all.

341
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:46,363
But we must find out

342
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:49,029
what they were after.

343
00:36:49,138 --> 00:36:53,165
I'm assigning you and Kano

344
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:57,542
to settle this matter
as quickly as possible.

345
00:36:57,647 --> 00:36:59,114
I'll handle it.

346
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:03,777
By the way,

347
00:37:04,454 --> 00:37:07,912
why were you sparring with Kano?

348
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:10,652
Little Religion...

349
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,131
I told Sozaburo

350
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,633
to spar with Capt. Inoue.

351
00:37:19,736 --> 00:37:21,135
You did?

352
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:38,582
Let me serve you a drink.

353
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,818
You're my guest.

354
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:10,009
Leave us. We have to talk.

355
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:33,437
Why were you holding back
against Inoue?

356
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,837
I wasn't.

357
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:40,507
Stop. I was watching you.
I've seen all your bouts.

358
00:38:40,616 --> 00:38:43,517
He can't possibly compete with you.

359
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,644
You weren't yourself.

360
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:47,814
Of course I was.

361
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:52,958
Is it because of his position?

362
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,257
I'm not criticizing.

363
00:38:56,365 --> 00:38:59,061
We all bow and scrape to them.

364
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:02,137
That's how they retain authority.

365
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:05,298
We're only equal in theory.

366
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:08,809
Anyone who doesn't agree,
who wants out,

367
00:39:11,247 --> 00:39:12,578
is killed.

368
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,408
That's what happened
to Yamanami last spring.

369
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,014
He was one of the first
of the militia's commanders.

370
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,560
On the eve of his death,

371
00:39:26,662 --> 00:39:30,689
a woman cried
at the window of his cell.

372
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:34,860
A woman with small feet.

373
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:39,905
But I'm digressing.

374
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:44,103
Do you know

375
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:48,448
why I was watching you so closely,

376
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:54,420
how I knew you were holding back?

377
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,724
Kano...

378
00:39:58,227 --> 00:40:00,161
Do you know?

379
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:04,322
Why?

380
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:06,933
I'd give my life

381
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:12,698
to wake to the nightingale's song,

382
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:16,801
after holding you in my arms
all night long.

383
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:26,983
Sozaburo, make my dream come true.

384
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:29,285
Someone might come in.

385
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:31,485
I'm not to be disturbed.

386
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:10,189
Don't tell Tashiro.

387
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:14,733
So it's true...

388
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:20,035
You're lovers.

389
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:33,114
Yamazaki, any news?

390
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:36,885
Are you still here, Capt. Inoue?

391
00:41:36,993 --> 00:41:39,723
Nothing on the crests?

392
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,490
It takes time.

393
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:45,033
I told him it was no use
staying here,

394
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:47,102
but he won't leave.

395
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:51,230
We've placed men all around town,

396
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,039
and we've let it be known
we're looking for them.

397
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:59,672
Capt. Inoue, you can't possibly

398
00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:02,114
roam around like Sozaburo.

399
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:08,221
Are the crests his only clues

400
00:42:08,324 --> 00:42:11,054
in the search for those two men?

401
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:16,225
No. They had Higo accents.

402
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:20,234
Twice a day,
he goes to the Ogawa Inn,

403
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:22,964
on the east side, near the bridge.

404
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:32,905
Please, sir.

405
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,740
may I?

406
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:37,938
Just in time. Follow them.

407
00:43:39,014 --> 00:43:41,005
But where are you going?

408
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:46,579
Fine. I'll report to you in Gion.

409
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:16,411
Waiting for someone?

410
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,749
Yes. A company aide.

411
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,894
- See anything?
- Nothing.

412
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:32,323
This way.

413
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,152
What do we do?

414
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:00,956
Go to the inn.

415
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,963
Now?

416
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:09,399
Shouldn't we wait
until we know more?

417
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:13,339
Never wait to pull a weed.

418
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:24,909
Where I come from,
the racoons dry in moonlight.

419
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,285
They take good care of their hides.

420
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,584
I see.

421
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:31,626
What do foxes do?

422
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:35,092
There's a den at the Hino temple.

423
00:45:35,197 --> 00:45:38,132
The foxes who live there

424
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:42,603
are very smart.
Whenever they buy sake,

425
00:45:42,705 --> 00:45:44,969
they pay for it.

426
00:45:45,074 --> 00:45:47,599
- With leaves?
- No.

427
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:51,510
With real tarnished coins.

428
00:45:51,614 --> 00:45:53,673
They're very clever.

429
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:57,741
Lieut. Commander Hijikata's family
had a gardener.

430
00:45:57,853 --> 00:46:02,187
His name was Genzaburo.
He grew potatoes.

431
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:06,318
The townspeople called him
Potato Gen.

432
00:46:06,428 --> 00:46:09,056
The kids from the next village

433
00:46:09,164 --> 00:46:13,760
would swim across the river.
They'd steal potatoes from him.

434
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,564
When he died,

435
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:20,472
they attended his funeral,
covered by huge leaves.

436
00:46:21,577 --> 00:46:25,377
People thought they were
river sprites.

437
00:46:25,481 --> 00:46:27,574
I didn't.

438
00:46:27,683 --> 00:46:28,980
Why not?

439
00:46:29,084 --> 00:46:31,018
Because among them,

440
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,749
among all these kids,
I recognized Hijikata.

441
00:46:39,094 --> 00:46:40,527
It's me, Soji.

442
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:49,334
Why are you dressed like that?

443
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:52,737
It's not my choice.
It's your fault.

444
00:46:55,144 --> 00:46:56,702
my fault?

445
00:46:56,812 --> 00:47:00,543
Capt. Inoue.
You pushed him to desperate lengths.

446
00:47:01,183 --> 00:47:02,673
Desperate?

447
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:07,279
Yes. He's left with Sozaburo Kano,
for the Ogawa Inn,

448
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:10,688
where the Higo men gather.

449
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:12,556
He's ready to die.

450
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:15,787
He hasn't got a chance.

451
00:47:15,898 --> 00:47:20,460
You know him.
He wanted to make up for his error.

452
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:21,661
That idiot!

453
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,206
Send him reinforcements,
immediately.

454
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:28,003
I'll be along with other troops.

455
00:47:30,312 --> 00:47:34,305
When fighting indoors,
choke up on your sword.

456
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:35,474
What do you mean?

457
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:38,553
Both hands up near the guard.

458
00:47:38,654 --> 00:47:40,281
Never aim for the head.

459
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:43,790
You might hit a ceiling
or bust a doorframe.

460
00:47:43,892 --> 00:47:46,326
- You've done that?
- Like this.

461
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:47,656
Near the guard?

462
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:50,664
Wait for the right moment to attack.

463
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:54,463
If you miss,
back up and come again.

464
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:58,301
Of course,
it's easier said than done.

465
00:48:19,027 --> 00:48:20,460
Open up!

466
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,805
Official search.

467
00:48:35,277 --> 00:48:37,074
I figured as much.

468
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:41,377
They followed us.
How many of them are there?

469
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:43,678
It's hard to see,

470
00:48:43,786 --> 00:48:47,449
but I think there's two of them.

471
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:48,818
Two?

472
00:48:50,058 --> 00:48:53,994
Go get the others.
I'll be right there.

473
00:48:54,096 --> 00:48:57,657
They wouldn't attack with only two.

474
00:48:57,766 --> 00:48:59,666
must be at least ten.

475
00:49:10,913 --> 00:49:15,680
What's the matter?
One moment, I'm coming.

476
00:49:19,087 --> 00:49:20,554
Shinsen militia.

477
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:22,851
What's your hurry?

478
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,152
move over!

479
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:27,194
I'll show you the way.

480
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,022
Come along.

481
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:33,325
This way.

482
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:36,362
Come along.

483
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:47,604
See, there's no one here.

484
00:49:59,628 --> 00:50:02,324
- Still warm.
- Warm?

485
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:05,457
You must be mistaken.

486
00:50:06,935 --> 00:50:09,335
Let's try the back door.

487
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:11,269
The back is on the river.

488
00:50:23,685 --> 00:50:26,210
- madam.
- What?

489
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,050
We're going down.

490
00:50:28,156 --> 00:50:29,851
must we?

491
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,756
Get me five lanterns and a ladder.

492
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:36,593
Why so many lanterns?

493
00:50:49,177 --> 00:50:50,610
There you are.

494
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:52,944
I see now.

495
00:50:53,048 --> 00:50:54,606
Not bad, eh?

496
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:58,044
Take a look down there.

497
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:00,011
See anyone?

498
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,914
No one.

499
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:04,993
I'll go down then.

500
00:51:47,936 --> 00:51:49,665
my leg's broken.

501
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,949
Who's there?
In the name of the Shinsen militia.

502
00:53:05,113 --> 00:53:06,375
Kano!

503
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:08,907
Hang on.

504
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:33,070
You're coming around. Sozaburo.

505
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:37,276
Finally. I was worried.

506
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:40,613
I feel better now. You all right?

507
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,891
On December 22nd of that year,

508
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:06,466
Commander Kondo
returned from Hiroshima.

509
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:11,805
A banquet in his honor
was held that evening.

510
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:13,306
Delicious.

511
00:54:15,984 --> 00:54:18,316
Kyoto sake is the best there is.

512
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,528
The Choshu clan is feigning loyalty

513
00:54:27,629 --> 00:54:30,427
to the emperor and the shogunate.

514
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,664
But they've got a secret agenda.

515
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:39,370
They're arming for combat.

516
00:54:42,177 --> 00:54:44,202
The shogunate is too weak.

517
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:48,077
They should attack now,

518
00:54:48,183 --> 00:54:51,152
smash them, occupy the land,

519
00:54:51,253 --> 00:54:53,244
before it's too late.

520
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:55,723
But, Commander Kondo,

521
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,683
last year,

522
00:54:59,928 --> 00:55:03,386
Choshu served
the isolationist cause,

523
00:55:03,498 --> 00:55:06,365
combatting foreign invaders.

524
00:55:07,936 --> 00:55:12,270
Every patriot praised their valor.

525
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:16,904
Do you support isolationism?

526
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,343
Yes, of course.

527
00:55:20,448 --> 00:55:25,044
Then you should be
more tolerant with them.

528
00:55:27,255 --> 00:55:31,123
Foreign cannons being,
unfortunately, more effective,

529
00:55:32,093 --> 00:55:33,890
in coastal areas,

530
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:38,457
Choshu batteries were wiped out.

531
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:40,892
And you believe

532
00:55:41,503 --> 00:55:46,270
the shogunate should eliminate
an already suffering clan?

533
00:55:46,374 --> 00:55:49,002
A samurai does not behave that way.

534
00:55:50,312 --> 00:55:52,246
A samurai does not behave...

535
00:55:53,715 --> 00:55:57,378
You mean that it's beneath him?

536
00:55:57,485 --> 00:55:58,747
Exactly.

537
00:56:02,224 --> 00:56:05,853
A true samurai is distinguished

538
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:09,419
by his sense of forbearance.

539
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:15,064
Or, to put it more simply,
by his mercy.

540
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,502
I know what you meant.

541
00:56:18,573 --> 00:56:20,438
I'm sure you do.

542
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:23,978
As our journey progressed

543
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,776
you understood me better and better.

544
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:29,877
Hijikata...

545
00:56:30,518 --> 00:56:32,850
I assure you, Hijikata...

546
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:35,150
What?

547
00:56:36,024 --> 00:56:39,619
Well that... Commander Kondo...

548
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:44,560
the more he saw of the deplorable
situation in Choshu,

549
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:48,295
the more his opinion changed.

550
00:56:49,204 --> 00:56:51,764
I believe our commander

551
00:56:51,873 --> 00:56:54,740
is the only one to restore order

552
00:56:54,843 --> 00:56:58,142
to the reigning confusion in Kyoto.

553
00:56:58,813 --> 00:56:59,973
Is that so?

554
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:02,208
What's your opinion?

555
00:57:03,118 --> 00:57:04,949
About this issue.

556
00:57:06,888 --> 00:57:09,652
It doesn't interest me at all.

557
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:12,321
Excuse me.

558
00:57:26,274 --> 00:57:29,141
I'm glad to see you again.

559
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,274
I thought you were laid up.

560
00:57:33,381 --> 00:57:36,475
I was ashamed to face you,

561
00:57:36,584 --> 00:57:40,247
but I changed my mind.
You've been apprised?

562
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:42,120
In a general way.

563
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:49,423
I apologize for the deaths
and injuries caused

564
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:51,465
by my blundering.

565
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,624
Your injury?

566
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:56,795
I fell from a ladder.

567
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:01,703
How is Kano?

568
00:58:02,277 --> 00:58:04,802
No damage to that pretty face?

569
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:10,975
Why were you coaching him?

570
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:13,851
Do you, too, have that leaning?

571
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:20,616
Not at all. But...

572
00:58:20,729 --> 00:58:21,787
But?

573
00:58:21,896 --> 00:58:23,693
I'm beginning to see

574
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:27,063
how certain men can be unsettled.

575
00:58:55,997 --> 00:58:57,430
Sozaburo...

576
00:59:53,188 --> 00:59:54,712
I wouldn't do that.

577
00:59:58,726 --> 01:00:02,389
Sozaburo, are you that much
in love with Tashiro?

578
01:00:03,531 --> 01:00:05,021
Why?

579
01:00:06,267 --> 01:00:08,326
Even with me?

580
01:00:08,436 --> 01:00:11,667
you remain somehow attached to him.

581
01:00:12,674 --> 01:00:14,539
Leave him.

582
01:00:14,642 --> 01:00:16,041
I can't.

583
01:00:17,078 --> 01:00:18,705
He keeps clutching?

584
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:22,282
Not really.

585
01:00:22,383 --> 01:00:24,112
Then why?

586
01:00:34,362 --> 01:00:35,294
I'll kill...

587
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:42,065
you...

588
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:44,702
No, not you.

589
01:00:48,443 --> 01:00:51,469
Lieut. Commander, it's Yamazaki.

590
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:54,913
Is it that urgent?

591
01:00:55,016 --> 01:00:57,814
One of our men has been killed.

592
01:00:57,919 --> 01:00:58,647
I'm coming.

593
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:22,470
Right here.

594
01:01:23,611 --> 01:01:27,047
The one who found him
recognized the uniform.

595
01:01:27,148 --> 01:01:29,946
The magistrate notified us.

596
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,051
Who was it?

597
01:01:32,153 --> 01:01:33,711
I'll go see.

598
01:01:37,525 --> 01:01:39,959
He's from the Tenth Unit,

599
01:01:40,061 --> 01:01:44,020
his name is Tojiro Yuzawa.

600
01:01:44,132 --> 01:01:48,068
Fatal wounds to the back and belly.

601
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,741
Yuzawa?

602
01:02:00,848 --> 01:02:03,339
I've met him somewhere.

603
01:02:07,522 --> 01:02:10,184
- The murderer?
- No one knows.

604
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:14,523
We thought it was
a Satsuma or a Tosa,

605
01:02:14,629 --> 01:02:17,621
but there was an eyewitness.

606
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:20,258
They're easy to spot.

607
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:23,303
And it wasn't one of them.

608
01:02:24,372 --> 01:02:25,930
Then who was it?

609
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,770
One of our own, I fear.

610
01:02:29,577 --> 01:02:33,308
Did Yuzawa have enemies
within our ranks?

611
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:35,940
I'll find out.

612
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:39,952
I wonder if he leaned that way.

613
01:02:40,054 --> 01:02:42,545
Leaned which way?

614
01:02:42,657 --> 01:02:43,681
A lover of men.

615
01:02:44,726 --> 01:02:46,956
It's common practice

616
01:02:47,061 --> 01:02:50,929
where he comes from.
But from the way he looked...

617
01:03:09,217 --> 01:03:11,913
Nothing yet. Sorry.

618
01:03:27,201 --> 01:03:30,500
It's getting late.
We'd better get back.

619
01:03:30,605 --> 01:03:32,573
I'll bring you some tea.

620
01:03:43,151 --> 01:03:45,210
About Sozaburo Kano...

621
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,551
Sozaburo?

622
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,518
Is he the lover of one of our men?

623
01:03:54,262 --> 01:03:56,025
Who do you mean?

624
01:03:57,265 --> 01:03:59,358
Besides Inoue of course.

625
01:04:01,636 --> 01:04:04,400
Hijikata, take care of this.

626
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,769
Take care of it?

627
01:04:08,943 --> 01:04:10,410
Kill him?

628
01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:13,107
Do you have no pity?

629
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:16,042
Kondo,

630
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:18,880
you're not in love with him,
are you?

631
01:04:18,986 --> 01:04:22,478
Toshi, you misunderstood me.

632
01:04:23,524 --> 01:04:26,049
I didn't say kill him.

633
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,958
I'm merely suggesting
you talk to Yamazaki,

634
01:04:29,063 --> 01:04:32,089
have him acquaint Sozaburo
with women.

635
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:34,734
That's all I'm saying.

636
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:44,703
Why does he still have those locks?

637
01:04:46,881 --> 01:04:49,247
lsn't he old enough to cut them?

638
01:04:53,187 --> 01:04:54,654
I'll do my best.

639
01:04:57,058 --> 01:04:59,424
Why are we both

640
01:04:59,527 --> 01:05:02,690
so indulgent with Sozaburo?

641
01:05:04,165 --> 01:05:07,100
So I take him
to the geisha district?

642
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:09,101
That's right.

643
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:11,103
But with what money?

644
01:05:11,205 --> 01:05:13,105
The militia can hardly afford it.

645
01:05:13,207 --> 01:05:16,608
His family must provide for him.

646
01:05:17,345 --> 01:05:19,813
This is for you.

647
01:05:34,896 --> 01:05:36,124
Kano.

648
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:37,458
Sgt. Yamazaki.

649
01:05:37,565 --> 01:05:39,999
How are you healing?

650
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:42,160
Can you wear the mask now?

651
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:44,830
- Yes.
- Glad to hear it.

652
01:05:45,306 --> 01:05:48,104
How about a drink, to celebrate?

653
01:05:48,209 --> 01:05:51,201
Want to go to Shimabara tonight?

654
01:05:51,312 --> 01:05:52,540
No, l...

655
01:05:52,947 --> 01:05:55,347
Don't be so stiff.

656
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:58,283
It's time you had a little fun.

657
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:01,220
It would do you good.

658
01:06:01,322 --> 01:06:03,313
I'm busy tonight.

659
01:06:03,424 --> 01:06:04,948
With who?

660
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:11,388
Tomorrow then?

661
01:06:11,499 --> 01:06:12,830
No, l...

662
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:14,265
Kano!

663
01:06:17,505 --> 01:06:20,599
He turned down all my offers.

664
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,275
All of them?

665
01:06:24,145 --> 01:06:27,012
- Very amusing.
- Why?

666
01:06:27,114 --> 01:06:28,638
Sozaburo

667
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:33,011
must be afraid
you're making advances.

668
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,680
I have no such intention.

669
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,314
Be patient.

670
01:06:37,925 --> 01:06:39,688
I have no doubt

671
01:06:39,794 --> 01:06:43,855
he and Tashiro are lovers.

672
01:06:44,765 --> 01:06:47,757
And many have courted him.
Yuzawa, Takeda...

673
01:06:48,536 --> 01:06:51,562
Gunpei Yomo.
And there are others.

674
01:06:52,907 --> 01:06:57,844
It must disgust him to think
you're doing the same thing.

675
01:06:59,547 --> 01:07:02,607
Win his confidence with kindness.

676
01:07:03,784 --> 01:07:06,252
He's still just a baby.

677
01:07:07,154 --> 01:07:09,748
That's not much of an excuse.

678
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:17,961
Kano!

679
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:32,472
I'm busy.

680
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:39,948
ALL THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT

681
01:07:41,022 --> 01:07:43,786
ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER...

682
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:05,412
- About Yuzawa...
- Yes.

683
01:08:05,513 --> 01:08:06,810
What?

684
01:08:07,715 --> 01:08:09,546
He courted me.

685
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:12,414
So he too had that leaning.

686
01:08:13,087 --> 01:08:15,521
And did you consent?

687
01:08:15,623 --> 01:08:18,114
Never. Of course not.

688
01:08:19,026 --> 01:08:21,688
Who are you involved with?

689
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:25,130
Nobody.

690
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:29,161
You're involved with no one?

691
01:08:31,072 --> 01:08:35,236
I have no doubt, personally,
that Sozaburo and Tashiro

692
01:08:35,343 --> 01:08:37,038
are lovers.

693
01:08:42,416 --> 01:08:44,179
It's you I love.

694
01:08:45,453 --> 01:08:48,388
You're mistaken about my intentions.

695
01:08:49,223 --> 01:08:52,784
I'm not making any proposition
of the kind.

696
01:08:53,527 --> 01:08:54,994
I'm only trying

697
01:08:55,096 --> 01:08:58,998
to show you the pleasures
of being with a woman.

698
01:09:01,769 --> 01:09:04,966
And that is Hijikata's wish as well.

699
01:09:05,773 --> 01:09:07,400
For you future.

700
01:09:08,109 --> 01:09:09,770
Do I have a future?

701
01:09:11,379 --> 01:09:14,542
Don't you think about that?

702
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:17,679
Why does a rich man's son

703
01:09:17,785 --> 01:09:20,481
join the militia?

704
01:09:21,022 --> 01:09:23,149
To have the right to kill.

705
01:09:27,128 --> 01:09:30,393
Kano, come to Shimabara tonight.

706
01:09:32,133 --> 01:09:34,328
Captain Takeda, too.

707
01:09:34,435 --> 01:09:36,733
He courted you as well?

708
01:09:37,138 --> 01:09:39,368
Don't confuse me with them.

709
01:09:41,809 --> 01:09:44,835
Lieut. Commander Hijikata,
I give up.

710
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:49,575
Consider it a militia assignment.

711
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:51,377
But...

712
01:09:51,919 --> 01:09:54,217
You're a lucky man!

713
01:10:04,165 --> 01:10:05,598
Sgt. Yamazaki...

714
01:10:07,201 --> 01:10:09,965
Would you take me to Shimabara?

715
01:10:10,071 --> 01:10:11,402
I'm free tonight.

716
01:10:11,505 --> 01:10:15,339
Really?
I must make one condition.

717
01:10:15,443 --> 01:10:17,411
I want it to be clear.

718
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:19,308
We're going for the girls.

719
01:10:19,413 --> 01:10:20,107
I know.

720
01:10:20,214 --> 01:10:22,842
Then we're on for tonight.

721
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:24,383
Yes.

722
01:10:29,423 --> 01:10:30,481
No, don't...

723
01:10:30,991 --> 01:10:32,652
What?

724
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,227
Nothing.

725
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:37,051
A girl who's gentle and kind.

726
01:10:38,432 --> 01:10:39,865
I have what you need.

727
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:42,094
No, I want the best.

728
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:43,636
The best?

729
01:10:44,004 --> 01:10:48,703
He's a son of the Echigoya's,
of Oshikoji.

730
01:10:49,944 --> 01:10:52,435
- Him?
- You know him?

731
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:54,912
By reputation. In that case,

732
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:59,452
I will reserve
Shimabara's best girl for him.

733
01:10:59,553 --> 01:11:04,115
I see. For a son of Echigoya,
but not for a samurai.

734
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:08,025
Not at all.
It's both together.

735
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:10,461
And for you, Yamazaki?

736
01:11:10,564 --> 01:11:13,590
No one.
I'm coming only as chaperon.

737
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:17,262
I'll drink sake,
in a separate room.

738
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:18,861
As you like.

739
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:32,442
Did you strap break?

740
01:11:33,921 --> 01:11:35,718
Put your foot here.

741
01:11:52,573 --> 01:11:54,438
Can you walk?

742
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:56,169
more or less.

743
01:11:56,277 --> 01:11:58,871
Should I call a palanquin?

744
01:12:10,591 --> 01:12:11,956
No, don't...

745
01:12:15,429 --> 01:12:17,090
Palanquin!

746
01:12:22,303 --> 01:12:24,669
To Shimabara, Wachigaiya's.

747
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:47,123
I'll be back.

748
01:12:47,228 --> 01:12:48,889
Thank you.

749
01:12:48,996 --> 01:12:50,054
Come in.

750
01:12:50,164 --> 01:12:51,188
There you are.

751
01:12:51,298 --> 01:12:53,766
We've been expecting you.
This way.

752
01:13:00,274 --> 01:13:01,605
There you are.

753
01:13:02,009 --> 01:13:04,136
Where is Omatsu?

754
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:10,747
I'll bring you tea.

755
01:13:10,851 --> 01:13:12,819
No tea. Sake.

756
01:13:15,856 --> 01:13:17,118
Listen.

757
01:13:17,224 --> 01:13:19,249
I've already told the boss.

758
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,420
Sozaburo Kano, who's with Nishiki,

759
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:26,260
has already been with men,
but never a woman.

760
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:29,165
This is his first time.
A tough case.

761
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:33,263
I trust you'll see to it
that all goes well.

762
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:34,966
I'm not staying.

763
01:13:36,443 --> 01:13:39,310
I understand your request.

764
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:24,713
Has Sozaburo Kano
returned this morning?

765
01:15:24,818 --> 01:15:26,979
About two hours ago.

766
01:15:38,465 --> 01:15:41,628
Sgt. Yamazaki,
it was a catastrophe.

767
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:44,568
He made such a terrible ruckus.

768
01:15:44,671 --> 01:15:47,265
He kept asking for you,

769
01:15:47,374 --> 01:15:50,070
and he wouldn't speak to the girls.

770
01:15:50,177 --> 01:15:53,704
We finally calmed him down,
put him to bed.

771
01:15:53,814 --> 01:15:57,250
But he left without doing anything.

772
01:15:57,351 --> 01:15:58,648
I'm sorry.

773
01:15:58,752 --> 01:16:02,620
I think he really wanted
to sleep with you.

774
01:16:02,723 --> 01:16:03,917
Deplorable.

775
01:16:04,024 --> 01:16:07,585
Why not sleep with him tonight?

776
01:16:07,694 --> 01:16:09,457
You're crazy!

777
01:16:09,696 --> 01:16:11,391
I'm joking.

778
01:16:11,498 --> 01:16:15,935
Come back and see us yourself,
put this behind us.

779
01:16:16,036 --> 01:16:18,971
No, I'm working late today.

780
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:48,391
You're making a mistake!
I'm with the militia!

781
01:17:36,116 --> 01:17:38,516
I've asked the captains

782
01:17:38,619 --> 01:17:42,555
to find out who's lost his dagger.

783
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:52,589
It isn't mine.

784
01:17:52,699 --> 01:17:56,692
If it were yours,
I wouldn't be here.

785
01:17:58,338 --> 01:18:02,274
I was informed this morning
that Hyozo Tashiro

786
01:18:02,376 --> 01:18:05,641
isn't carrying a dagger
with his sword.

787
01:18:06,513 --> 01:18:08,105
Hyozo Tashiro?

788
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,283
I see...

789
01:18:19,226 --> 01:18:21,888
You're in a terrible spot.

790
01:18:22,596 --> 01:18:25,895
He must think
you stole Sozaburo from him.

791
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:30,167
He sees you as his rival.

792
01:18:31,805 --> 01:18:35,639
Jealousy among men
is a horrible thing.

793
01:18:37,077 --> 01:18:40,774
Especially since Tashiro
was his first lover.

794
01:18:41,682 --> 01:18:44,310
You dared steal him away.

795
01:18:44,651 --> 01:18:46,778
I didn't steal anyone!

796
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,781
I know.

797
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:58,088
Tashiro was a foot soldier,
wasn't he?

798
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:00,530
Even less.

799
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:04,001
He was servant to a tenant farmer.

800
01:19:05,205 --> 01:19:07,435
Perhaps he acquired
these practices there.

801
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:11,974
A samurai can be undone
by the love of men.

802
01:19:13,547 --> 01:19:16,812
He must be Yuzawa's murderer.

803
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,920
One is tempted to take pity on him,

804
01:19:24,024 --> 01:19:27,118
but we can't just let this go.

805
01:19:28,128 --> 01:19:29,060
Let's kill him.

806
01:19:31,898 --> 01:19:35,425
He's touched by a certain madness.

807
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:40,403
Who knows what problems
he can make for us.

808
01:19:41,141 --> 01:19:43,632
Some would exploit this

809
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:46,406
to create divisions among us.

810
01:19:48,015 --> 01:19:51,678
Hijikata, this must be kept secret.

811
01:19:53,253 --> 01:19:55,187
But who will kill him?

812
01:19:56,156 --> 01:19:58,317
Sozaburo Kano.

813
01:20:00,127 --> 01:20:01,253
That's a little...

814
01:20:02,763 --> 01:20:04,094
cruel.

815
01:20:08,902 --> 01:20:11,393
Can he manage alone?

816
01:20:12,439 --> 01:20:14,498
Tashiro is his equal.

817
01:20:14,608 --> 01:20:17,168
Yes, he can do it.

818
01:20:18,045 --> 01:20:19,478
I'm not so sure.

819
01:20:19,946 --> 01:20:22,380
He could be killed, in fact.

820
01:20:22,482 --> 01:20:24,973
Go as observers.

821
01:20:25,218 --> 01:20:28,312
You and Okita.
That should be enough.

822
01:20:28,855 --> 01:20:30,686
me?

823
01:20:33,527 --> 01:20:35,461
What a burden.

824
01:20:40,133 --> 01:20:43,068
Me? Kill Tashiro?

825
01:20:46,273 --> 01:20:48,036
I'll do my best.

826
01:20:49,076 --> 01:20:51,271
What can he be feeling?

827
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:53,979
You'll be alone.

828
01:20:55,816 --> 01:20:57,875
We'll be watching from afar.

829
01:20:57,984 --> 01:21:02,478
But... if it goes wrong,
we won't be able to step in.

830
01:21:03,457 --> 01:21:05,755
We can only watch. Understand?

831
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,434
Kano.

832
01:21:22,909 --> 01:21:25,742
Why do you keep those locks?

833
01:21:25,846 --> 01:21:26,744
No reason.

834
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:28,371
Cut them off.

835
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:32,045
Let me keep them a while.

836
01:21:32,486 --> 01:21:33,612
Why?

837
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,585
I made a vow.

838
01:22:08,688 --> 01:22:10,485
Right here is fine.

839
01:22:13,393 --> 01:22:15,554
Why Sozaburo Kano?

840
01:22:19,466 --> 01:22:21,058
Kondo decided.

841
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:23,267
Why?

842
01:22:25,672 --> 01:22:27,469
I don't know.

843
01:22:28,642 --> 01:22:31,372
Could he be in love with him?

844
01:22:32,913 --> 01:22:36,508
He's not like that.
You know very well.

845
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:38,347
Still...

846
01:22:39,019 --> 01:22:40,850
Still what?

847
01:22:41,922 --> 01:22:45,983
He doesn't look at him
the way he looks at the others.

848
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:48,860
Neither do you.

849
01:22:50,897 --> 01:22:52,865
Me and Sozaburo?

850
01:22:54,434 --> 01:22:59,030
Soji, could you be jealous
of Sozaburo?

851
01:23:02,776 --> 01:23:06,337
I was brought up
by you and Commander Kondo.

852
01:23:06,446 --> 01:23:08,539
I'm not jealous.

853
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:13,317
What about the two of you?

854
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:16,350
What do you mean?

855
01:23:17,023 --> 01:23:19,821
There's a tacit understanding

856
01:23:19,926 --> 01:23:22,326
no one comes between you.

857
01:23:22,829 --> 01:23:25,024
The spirit of the militia.

858
01:23:25,966 --> 01:23:28,958
Anyone who tries to step in,

859
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:31,560
or if Kondo makes a friend,

860
01:23:33,139 --> 01:23:35,164
you nip it in the bud.

861
01:23:36,243 --> 01:23:37,801
Soji, shut up!

862
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:47,047
I've just read a good book.

863
01:23:48,321 --> 01:23:50,881
The doctor told me to rest

864
01:23:50,991 --> 01:23:54,950
so I read
Tale of the Rain and the moon,

865
01:23:55,061 --> 01:23:58,087
including A Vow Between Two men.

866
01:23:59,633 --> 01:24:04,400
The story of a scholar
who takes care

867
01:24:04,504 --> 01:24:08,372
of a samurai who'd fallen
ill while traveling.

868
01:24:09,676 --> 01:24:11,906
After a while, they grow close

869
01:24:12,012 --> 01:24:16,449
and take an oath
of everlasting friendship.

870
01:24:18,818 --> 01:24:21,719
But the samurai

871
01:24:21,821 --> 01:24:23,812
must return to his group.

872
01:24:23,924 --> 01:24:25,755
Se he leaves,

873
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:29,727
promising he'll return
the following year, September 9th.

874
01:24:31,698 --> 01:24:36,158
Time passes.
Chrysanthemum season comes around.

875
01:24:37,137 --> 01:24:39,605
The morning of the 9th,

876
01:24:39,706 --> 01:24:44,166
the scholar and his mother
prepare flowers, sake and fish.

877
01:24:45,211 --> 01:24:48,305
But the samurai doesn't come.

878
01:24:49,816 --> 01:24:53,809
The scholar's mother
tries to comfort him, in vain.

879
01:24:54,387 --> 01:24:56,651
He comes outside his house.

880
01:24:57,724 --> 01:25:01,660
The moon is behind the mountains.
All is dark.

881
01:25:02,262 --> 01:25:04,787
He's about to go back inside

882
01:25:04,898 --> 01:25:07,628
when he sees a man in the shadows.

883
01:25:07,734 --> 01:25:10,362
The samurai has come.

884
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:12,961
He shows him inside.

885
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:18,473
The samurai seems strangely
sad and quiet.

886
01:25:18,578 --> 01:25:21,240
He won't eat or drink.

887
01:25:22,082 --> 01:25:23,845
Suddenly he says

888
01:25:25,752 --> 01:25:29,017
he no longer belongs to this world.

889
01:25:31,124 --> 01:25:34,753
On the journey home,
he'd been taken prisoner.

890
01:25:34,861 --> 01:25:37,659
He couldn't escape.

891
01:25:37,764 --> 01:25:41,063
So he killed himself
and kept his promise.

892
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:44,068
His spirit was carried on the wind.

893
01:25:45,672 --> 01:25:47,037
Lovely.

894
01:25:48,074 --> 01:25:51,840
Yes. And the moral is,

895
01:25:51,945 --> 01:25:55,346
avoid frivolous people

896
01:25:55,448 --> 01:25:59,714
and surround yourself
with friends you can count on.

897
01:26:01,187 --> 01:26:04,679
I think the two men in the story

898
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:07,089
have feelings of love.

899
01:26:09,095 --> 01:26:11,893
Otherwise, why kill yourself

900
01:26:11,998 --> 01:26:14,865
in order to keep your word?

901
01:26:16,136 --> 01:26:19,333
Even the title suggests it.

902
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:56,740
No...

903
01:27:01,681 --> 01:27:03,114
What is it?

904
01:27:03,883 --> 01:27:05,111
Nothing.

905
01:27:19,099 --> 01:27:20,498
Soji,

906
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,694
could it be you're in love
with Sozaburo?

907
01:27:23,803 --> 01:27:25,498
What?

908
01:27:27,974 --> 01:27:30,568
You know I'm not like that.

909
01:27:32,879 --> 01:27:34,369
Yes, but...

910
01:27:34,914 --> 01:27:38,611
Why do you read that kind of book?

911
01:27:40,353 --> 01:27:41,820
And why

912
01:27:42,889 --> 01:27:44,914
do you think all this up?

913
01:27:45,992 --> 01:27:49,325
I don't understand these people.
I hate them.

914
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:53,365
I hate Tashiro and Sozaburo.

915
01:27:54,567 --> 01:27:57,161
I can't stand them.

916
01:27:57,904 --> 01:28:01,465
The sound of their voices
gives me a chill.

917
01:28:02,909 --> 01:28:05,377
But I love beautiful stories.

918
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:07,938
Don't you, Hijikata?

919
01:28:36,609 --> 01:28:37,803
Here they are.

920
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,394
You betrayed me.

921
01:29:02,168 --> 01:29:04,602
You murdered Yuzawa

922
01:29:04,704 --> 01:29:08,765
and ambushed Sgt. Yamazaki.
There is proof.

923
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:11,571
The rules say you must die.

924
01:29:12,312 --> 01:29:14,303
What proof do you have?

925
01:29:15,648 --> 01:29:17,878
Could we have been mistaken?

926
01:29:20,086 --> 01:29:23,487
Sozaburo, you killed Yuzawa.

927
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:27,926
You stole my dagger
to implicate me.

928
01:30:28,388 --> 01:30:29,719
Forgive me.

929
01:30:38,064 --> 01:30:39,964
What did he say?

930
01:30:40,066 --> 01:30:41,533
I couldn't hear.

931
01:31:36,489 --> 01:31:39,117
Tashiro was completely thrown.

932
01:31:40,793 --> 01:31:43,057
What did Sozaburo tell him?

933
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:48,566
Even if we heard,
we wouldn't have understood.

934
01:31:49,802 --> 01:31:53,238
Perhaps they were words
shared by lovers.

935
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,288
I forgot something.

936
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:12,358
I must go back.

937
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:21,463
Soji...

938
01:32:26,672 --> 01:32:29,232
You didn't love Sozaburo

939
01:32:29,342 --> 01:32:31,606
but he loved you.

940
01:32:52,365 --> 01:32:53,832
Destroy him.

941
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,567
Okita!

942
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:07,270
Sozaburo was too beautiful.

943
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:10,645
men took advantage of him.

944
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:13,109
He was possessed by evil.
