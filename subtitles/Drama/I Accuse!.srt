00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:31,477
Good morning.

12
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,985
What have you got for me?

13
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,896
- Registered mail for the professor.
- Registered mail?

14
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,957
- Where from?
- Munich.

15
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:47,264
- Hooray. Berta!
- Ma'am, your signature!

16
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,911
What? Sure, come in.

17
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,571
Berta!

18
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,119
Come!

19
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,930
Berta.

20
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:16,166
Berta! Leave That! Come on.

21
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,001
- Thank you. Good-bye.
- My pencil?

22
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,341
- Sorry. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:29,213
Give him a tip. I must call Thomas.
A letter from Munich.

24
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,617
Is very exciting!

25
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,822
Hello? Hanna Heyt speaking.
Put me through to my husband please.

26
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:51,232
Oh, Berta, I opened it.
Should I read it?

27
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:57,504
- What is this letter?
- Is from Munich. The university. You know.

28
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:02,074
Yes, Dr. Burckhardt?
Can I speak to my husband?

29
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,085
The professor is giving his lecture.
Can I take a message?

30
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:08,247
Please tell him to call me immediately.

31
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,984
A letter has arrived from Munich.

32
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,461
Yes, I'll tell him.

33
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,521
Good-bye.

34
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,535
- You're going to Munich?
- I don't dare read it. Is for Thomas.

35
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:27,063
- Where is the professor?
- He'll call me after his lecture.

36
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:32,605
In conclusion,
ladies and gentlemen...

37
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,705
we have no idea
what causes the diseases...

38
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,273
that affect
the central nervous system...

39
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:43,179
which proves there is still plenty of
new ground to cover in Medical Research.

40
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:45,590
This keeps us modest.

41
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,688
For how the mind works
in relation to the brain...

42
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:55,099
how awareness and abstract thought
form in the nervous system...

43
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,228
is something
we know nothing about.

44
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,795
Not yet.

45
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:01,905
I envy you your youth...

46
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:06,276
because you may live to see
these puzzles solved.

47
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,183
Please stay. I'm so nervous.

48
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:18,089
Thomas has been waiting for this.
I hope he hasn't been rejected.

49
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:22,493
Yes, Thomas. The letter is here.
From the university in Munich.

50
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,053
May I open it?

51
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:25,622
Hang on.

52
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:35,303
Thomas! You got it!
You're a professor in Munich!

53
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:38,539
I'm so happy, Thomas!
Just imagine, Munich!

54
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,480
What? When? One second.

55
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,039
Yes, starting in the fall.

56
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:47,110
I have to tell Bernhard right away.
He's waiting for the answer.

57
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:50,487
Come home soon. Bye.

58
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,253
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:54,727
Congratulations.

60
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,663
Where is Dr. Lang?
I need to talk to him.

61
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,990
At the clinic? Now?

62
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,179
Please look after him.

63
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:30,954
And he's screaming so loud.

64
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:33,398
How did you know it was a boy?

65
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,468
He takes after my husband.

66
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,872
First, we'll get an apartment
on Wiegermeier Strasse.

67
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:43,604
The house will be sold, of course.

68
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,771
We'll build a new one there.

69
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,439
And the Alps are close by
for skiing and climbing.

70
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,382
Good for breaking your neck.

71
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,611
Eduard, the fool, will be mad.

72
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,987
I'll call him and rub it in.

73
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,649
I therefore recommend...

74
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:04,630
that you buy shares by the block.

75
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:10,631
This way, our group would obtain
the required majority.

76
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,567
Yes?

77
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,139
Majority, right?

78
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,644
- Hello, Hanna.
- See? Now we are going to Munich.

79
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:24,276
And Thomas will be director of the
Institute. See what a fool you are?

80
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:25,944
Then I send my congratulations.

81
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:27,948
Yes.

82
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:32,516
You won't be able to pick on me.
Phone calls to Munich are 1.20 marks.

83
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,083
Thas per minute.

84
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,024
You have to make peace
with Thomas. I insist.

85
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:42,092
Thomas likes you,
but you've acted like a fool.

86
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,333
- Well?
- All right. When?

87
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,739
How about tonight?
Les celebrate tonight.

88
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,973
I'll invite all our friends.
I'll call back later.

89
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,378
Berta! We'll celebrate tonight.

90
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,509
I'll go shopping.
There'll be at least 10 guests.

91
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:02,789
Get Ella to help you.

92
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:06,020
Yes? The doctor's still out?

93
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:08,119
Tell him to call me back.

94
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:09,686
He's not there.

95
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:15,863
Well.

96
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:21,539
- Meningitis.
- Is it fatal?

97
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,270
Yes, unfortunately.

98
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:27,472
Doctor, can she stay home?

99
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,881
I'd like to look after her myself.

100
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:35,716
Mr. Straten will be here
and Professor Schlüter.

101
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,623
And you know who else? Eduard too.

102
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:44,328
- I'm happy to hear about your brother.
- Time for him come off his high horse.

103
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:49,563
Is because of his money. He was afraid I'd
lose mine and he might have to support me.

104
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,434
Do we have enough wine?

105
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:54,338
I think so.

106
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,069
I'll check.

107
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,810
What happened, Hanna?

108
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:05,546
What idiot put the basket here?

109
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,713
Did you hurt yourself?

110
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:11,153
Yes. My foot.

111
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,557
Thas because you always take
three steps at a time.

112
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:16,153
My hand hurts too.

113
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,720
Should I look after the wine?

114
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,732
I'll go.

115
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,625
How much do we need?

116
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,434
For Professor Schlüter alone,
we'll need three bottles.

117
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,099
I have to give a speech.

118
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:34,512
- Do you have to, Professor?
- Of course the professor must.

119
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:37,517
Yes, my young colleagues.
The speech is a must.

120
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:41,155
Silencio!

121
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:45,682
- Ill be at least a half hour.
- Yes, he's working for his food.

122
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,923
My friends, don't be afraid.

123
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:54,161
The food has been very good.
Excellent, in fact.

124
00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:56,499
Or did anyone not like it?

125
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:59,540
So we must thank Hanna.

126
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:04,438
Our friend Thomas is a great man.

127
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:07,640
Now he's leaving us
to become even greater.

128
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:11,116
But where would Thomas be
without his wife?

129
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:16,117
He is a quiet scholar
and serious researcher.

130
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,853
She is his good fortune and life itself.

131
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:23,920
Thas how it is.
One complements the other.

132
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,296
For each one alone
is completely different.

133
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,995
- Come in.
- Are they still eating?

134
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,560
They've just finished.

135
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,799
Then I'll eat with you in the kitchen.

136
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:40,478
Then again, the two are quite similar.

137
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:44,985
Thomas has his lab at the clinic
where he does his research...

138
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,044
with his microscope
and flasks and apparatus...

139
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:50,056
the whole scientific arsenal.

140
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:54,288
While Hanna, here in this house,
has the arsenal of life.

141
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:56,922
All the things they have here.

142
00:09:56,998 --> 00:10:00,161
Look at the small coach over there.

143
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:04,228
It surely reminds her
of a special day.

144
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:08,969
Over on the desk, the china dancer.

145
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:13,273
It, too, must have a happy
meaning for her.

146
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,678
And then the picture over there.

147
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:21,979
It was probably bought
to keep a romantic memory alive.

148
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,887
So thas why I raise
my glass to them. Cheers.

149
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,222
Cheers.

150
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,322
This tastes great.

151
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,733
Even better here,
because I don't have to put on airs.

152
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,738
Where were you all day?
Hanna called many times.

153
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,840
- Doctor's office, Berta.
- We thought you wouldn't come.

154
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,571
Berta, really.

155
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,306
On such an important day?

156
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,314
Hanna's brother is here.

157
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,577
He's to make peace with the professor.

158
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:55,188
Les drink to that, Berta.

159
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,917
You make light of everything.

160
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,959
Even as a boy.

161
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,119
Dear Berta,
let me tell you something.

162
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:07,631
You've raised Hanna like a mother
since her mother's death. I know.

163
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:11,536
You stayed with her after she married
Thomas, though he was disliked.

164
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:15,905
But even you never thought
he'd make professor.

165
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,467
And who has said so
from the start? I have.

166
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,207
And you call this
making light of things?

167
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,944
But it was hard until
Hanna inherited that money.

168
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:27,510
- You weren't exactly starving.
- Well, if it hadn't been for you-

169
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,748
Exactly.

170
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:31,257
The two of us are the true heroes.

171
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:35,089
If you hadn't let me go dry,
we could toast to that.

172
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,529
- Are you going to Munich too?
- If the professor will have me.

173
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,293
Les clear the table.

174
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,136
Here's to Hanna.

175
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,470
- Bernhard.
- Eduard.

176
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,038
There you are.

177
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:58,347
- I haven't seen you in a long time.
- Yes.

178
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,184
We were in opposite camps.

179
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,320
Yes.

180
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,358
You should have married her.

181
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:09,759
He's a genius.

182
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,928
Thanks to you.

183
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,532
He's my friend.

184
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:18,197
I also always thought
Bernhard would marry her.

185
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:19,933
See?

186
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,438
Must be boring in there.
All those doctors.

187
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:27,811
Imagine a metastasis of an abscess...

188
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:30,851
following surgery
for sepsis of the arm.

189
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,408
Things you wouldn't believe.

190
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,818
- Where is Eduard?
- I don't know.

191
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:38,689
- Now is your turn.
- Well, my dear Professor.

192
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,319
Pain is doubtlessly Goïs idea.

193
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:45,525
He wanted childbirth to be painful.
Or he would have done it differently.

194
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,090
Pastor, you don't know your Bible.

195
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:51,832
When God created Eve from Adam's rib,
he put him in a deep sleep.

196
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:56,036
Thas proof that God
is in favor of anesthesia.

197
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:01,308
You? Here?
What are you doing here?

198
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:05,751
- Family meeting. Come sit down.
- I have to attend to my guests.

199
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,084
- Hanna.
- Bernhard. I missed you.

200
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,986
Where were you all day?

201
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,217
The clinic, Hanna.

202
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,784
- Say, are you limping?
- Is nothing. I fell down the stairs.

203
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,729
Don't start that medical jargon.
There's enough next door.

204
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:28,633
- Have you seen my wife?
- I think she's outside.

205
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,768
You'll dance with me later.

206
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:38,282
There you are. Look at you.

207
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,411
Come, les see our guests.

208
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:45,119
- Did you miss me?
- Of course.

209
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,089
- Good day, Bernhard.
- Hello, Thomas.

210
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:52,997
- Nice of you to come.
- My hearty congratulations, Thomas.

211
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,557
Thank you.

212
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:01,272
They're dancing in there.
We should go too.

213
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:04,334
- Can you dance with that foot?
- Sure, I can.

214
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,115
Well?

215
00:14:12,987 --> 00:14:13,987
Well.

216
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:28,224
You have to see it
as a businessman.

217
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,792
I just can't understand it.

218
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,361
Losing one's only daughter...

219
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:36,102
to a researcher at a small university,
and on top of-

220
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,837
You think only in percentages.

221
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,607
Yes, Doctor.

222
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,012
But you still accept
your brother-in-law?

223
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,913
Yes, sure.

224
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,418
Your candor is almost endearing.

225
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:47,511
- Cigar?
- Thanks.

226
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:50,580
I'll go into surgery.
I have always wanted to do that.

227
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:53,821
Isn't it terrible to cut off
arms and legs all day?

228
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,862
No, I quite enjoy that.

229
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,808
The professor is the greatest researcher
I know. He will be world famous.

230
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,823
Sounds like you've got
a crush on him.

231
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,835
Why? Is nothing to do with a crush.

232
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,736
Remember how you beat me up
in elementary school?

233
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,798
Yes, when you called me socialist.

234
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:10,537
You had good reason.

235
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,135
But...

236
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,977
we were friendly then.

237
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,579
We can be now, if you want.

238
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,485
I'll get him.

239
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,281
I'd like to see your institute.

240
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,020
Can I see Dr. Burckhardt as well?

241
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,585
Yes, of course.
She's a hard worker.

242
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,790
- Here's Bernharïs cello.
- Still playing trio?

243
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,526
Yes, we're very musical.

244
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:38,834
I'd better say good-bye.
I think I'm being called away.

245
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:42,239
- Shame.
- Good-bye.

246
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,369
Everyone should have
an examination every six months.

247
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,107
It will be made into law,
believe me.

248
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,513
There's the cello.
Now we'll hear the trio play, right?

249
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,347
- We promised.
- Well, friends, les get ready.

250
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,411
We won't have many more
chances to hear them.

251
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,252
Come over here.

252
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:27,474
I like music, but not so close.

253
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,827
- Whas that?
- Don't know.

254
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,996
The air is clean of sound.
We can go back now.

255
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:05,703
- Thas odd about the hand, right?
- Yes, odd.

256
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:09,078
A doctor on every finger,
but no one knows whas wrong.

257
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,811
- Good-bye.
- Thank you.

258
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:14,547
Great performance, too.

259
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,021
Many thanks.

260
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,285
Let me tell you...

261
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,021
- it was also a great day for me.
- Glad to hear that.

262
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,585
Good-bye, son.

263
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,155
- Whas with your hand?
- A little nervous.

264
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,724
Don't get her started,
or we'll have our first fight ever.

265
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:31,293
Come, Bernhard, leave the young ones.
We'll go for drinks.

266
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,532
- Bernhard and drinks.
- Why not?

267
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,268
You don't have time for that.

268
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,387
Tell me, he doesn't go for drinks
because he's so busy...

269
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,743
or does he work so much
so that he doesn't go drinking?

270
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,941
- You're so smart.
- I'll get him home.

271
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,177
Good-bye.

272
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:48,312
Don't talk about me
behind my back.

273
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,019
Now les go for a drink.

274
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,791
- Will it be this nice in Munich?
- Even better.

275
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,997
- What Schlüter said was nice.
- Yes, it was.

276
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,732
The Hanna anthem.

277
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:08,969
What sort of memento
would you like for tonight?

278
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,703
Have you thought of something?

279
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,147
We could use a picture here.

280
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,778
- Good night.
- Good night, Berta.

281
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:24,012
- Do you need my help?
- No, go to bed.

282
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:27,026
We'll do that tomorrow.
You must be very tired.

283
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:28,789
- Good night.
- Good night.

284
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:31,556
- Good night.
- Good night.

285
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,182
So beautiful out here.

286
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,521
What should we wish for
if we see a shooting star?

287
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,460
We don't need that.

288
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:11,634
Isn't life wonderful?

289
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:15,139
Yes, because of you.

290
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:22,712
- I just thought of a picture.
- What?

291
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,714
Us.

292
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,880
Oh, Thomas.

293
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:39,496
- Can you help me with that?
- You should see a good doctor.

294
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:42,899
- I have one.
- No, is not from your fall.

295
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,097
See Bernhard.

296
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:47,003
If necessary,
he'll refer you to a specialist.

297
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,564
Yes, you.

298
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:52,806
I specialize in cutting bodies open
to see what went wrong.

299
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:58,481
Bernhard will diagnose you.
We can't do that at the lab.

300
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:01,521
Make an appointment.
It can't hurt.

301
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:03,682
Here.

302
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:05,918
Now, I'm off to my lecture.

303
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:12,398
- Too bad that can't heal my hand.
- Silly.

304
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:37,347
- Don't forget to see Bernhard.
- Of course I'll see him. What do you think?

305
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,529
Do you have an idea?

306
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,361
I think so.

307
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,534
I feel so strange.
Just like everyone describes it.

308
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,145
I haven't told Thomas yet.

309
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,704
I have to know for sure first.

310
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:06,879
Don't you think that the hand
and foot are linked to that too?

311
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:10,116
I know nothing
about such things, dear.

312
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:13,515
You've wasted all your time
just with me.

313
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,185
It was my pleasure.

314
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,862
But I won't let Bernhard
examine me.

315
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:23,835
- But you can ask him.
- He'll know more than both of us.

316
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:27,633
I didn't want to keep you waiting.

317
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,548
I don't need you now, Nurse.

318
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:38,548
Yes, Doctor.

319
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:42,554
- I'll check on the preparations.
- All right.

320
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:45,718
I'm worried about you.

321
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,117
- Whas the problem?
- Still the silly hand.

322
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:51,426
And the foot is acting up again.

323
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:02,269
- All stiff.
- Yes, for two days.

324
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,549
- It comes and goes, right?
- Yes, but never this bad.

325
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,278
- Does this hurt?
- No.

326
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,449
Take off your coat.

327
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,290
What are going to do?

328
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:27,629
Use electricity to see
if is the muscles or the nerves.

329
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,362
Nerves? I'm not nervous.

330
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:37,203
- And the foot?
- The ankle hurts a bit.

331
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:57,393
Say, Bernhard...

332
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,898
tell me.

333
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:03,697
Could this mean I'm going to have a baby?

334
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:08,901
I feel so strange and dizzy.

335
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,068
Will you let me examine you?

336
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:12,975
You? Not a chance.

337
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:15,742
Have you examine me?

338
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:18,648
We've been friends
far too long for this.

339
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,081
I almost married you...

340
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:24,817
if you had asked me.

341
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,382
That is, before I knew Thomas.

342
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,691
But could my hunch be right?

343
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,854
I don't know.

344
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,739
That feels funny.

345
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,900
Whas it for?

346
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,912
Your muscles are fine.

347
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,814
Tell me...

348
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,749
what did you mean by dizzy and such?

349
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:57,083
Well, is as if-

350
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,783
as if I had stared into the sun.

351
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,158
Then I feel dizzy.

352
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,891
You see black spots?

353
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,227
Yes.

354
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,726
Maybe I should refer you
to an eye doctor.

355
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:14,433
Come on, I don't need glasses.

356
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:43,591
- Do companies send these to you?
- Yes.

357
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,429
- As samples?
- Yes.

358
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:49,742
Free of charge?

359
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:53,076
Yes.

360
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:55,307
And who gets them?

361
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,844
Whoever really needs them.

362
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,319
What are you reading?

363
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:09,759
You wouldn't be
a very passionate husband.

364
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:16,197
You don't know that
I would have married you.

365
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:19,238
Of course not.
You're married to medicine.

366
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,605
Come here, you psychologist,
and sit down.

367
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:34,644
- My wife is ungracious.
- Thas doctors for you.

368
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:36,814
For headaches,
you prescribe castor oil...

369
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,552
when a hand hurts,
you stare into our eyes.

370
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:41,287
Be quiet a moment.

371
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:51,737
Staring into the abyss.

372
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:04,406
Well, did you see something nice?

373
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,615
The curse of beautiful eyes.

374
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,318
Look to the right.

375
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,221
No, nose straight ahead.

376
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:16,785
Eyes to the right.

377
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:20,057
Eyes left.

378
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,294
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

379
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,428
Don't tell me.

380
00:28:24,504 --> 00:28:26,438
I already know.

381
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:28,406
Having a baby is not a disease.

382
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,542
Yes?

383
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:36,446
We're done here.

384
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:38,609
I'll see you tonight or tomorrow?

385
00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:41,848
Good-bye, you serious man.

386
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:51,123
Good-bye, Nurse Emma.

387
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:53,665
He looked deep into my eyes.

388
00:29:01,975 --> 00:29:03,738
Is something wrong, Doctor?

389
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:10,008
Call the lab. I must talk
with Professor Heyt urgently.

390
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:16,619
All clear. 56-82.
Typhoid BC negative.

391
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:23,595
56-83.

392
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:28,356
Typhoid BC negative.

393
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:31,927
- 56-85.
- What about 84?

394
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:34,769
Low on serum.
I've ordered a new one.

395
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:40,276
People are different.
I couldn't live without my work.

396
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,109
Too bad.

397
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:43,843
A real pity.

398
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:51,216
Hertenberg says that all lines of human conflict
converge into marriage like a focal point.

399
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:54,336
And the conflicts are carried out in the
third and fourth dimensions of marriage?

400
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,850
No thanks.

401
00:29:57,864 --> 00:30:00,697
But the marital hostilities
actually end after-

402
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:03,301
Just a minute.

403
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,799
56-85. Typhoid negative.

404
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:15,177
B: 1-100 positive.
1-200 plus, minus.

405
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:18,714
The marital hostilities
end after the first child.

406
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:25,080
And C: Negative.

407
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:30,658
Children, yes,
but why get married?

408
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:34,689
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello.

409
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,962
- Is your boss around?
- Yes, in his office there.

410
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:42,100
56-86-Typhoid BC.

411
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,036
- Hello.
- Hello, where's the fire?

412
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:48,978
One second. Just sit down.

413
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,983
Sorry, but I'd like
to finish this thought first.

414
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:01,423
- Bernhard.
- Hello, Thomas.

415
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:05,997
So, Hanna came by.

416
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,295
She didn't want me to examine her.

417
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,165
Probably for the best.

418
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:12,727
She also gave me a tough time.

419
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:16,241
I only checked
her reflexes and her eyes.

420
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,470
I see.

421
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:22,303
Her bones and muscles are fine.

422
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:25,545
- But the nerves-
- Hanna and nerves? Impossible.

423
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,653
Temporal pallor of the optic disc...

424
00:31:33,126 --> 00:31:35,219
central scotoma...

425
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:38,560
- paralysis of the left hand.
- Yes. And?

426
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,891
Multiple sclerosis.

427
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,397
My God.

428
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,299
Thas a death sentence.

429
00:31:53,613 --> 00:31:55,547
What makes you think that?

430
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,546
Is a very rare condition.

431
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:01,920
No, what she will have to go through.

432
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:07,048
You know I was an assistant
in the neurological department.

433
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,957
Yes, of course.

434
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:13,129
- Is incurable, right?
- Some, certainly not all.

435
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:19,738
I wish I were wrong.

436
00:32:19,806 --> 00:32:21,740
We must consult a specialist.

437
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:23,298
Who do you suggest?

438
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,768
Werther. He's the best.

439
00:32:31,584 --> 00:32:33,074
You know what?

440
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,813
I don't believe it.

441
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:39,017
Look, Bernhard, that disease in Hanna.
She's healthy as an ox.

442
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,784
Listen Bernhard, don't be angry...

443
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,124
but I know how you feel
about Hanna.

444
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:48,463
We never talked about it, no need.

445
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:53,198
But do you think is possible...

446
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:58,767
that you let your subconscious
influence you?

447
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:01,174
Possible.

448
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:06,251
But make sure you don't let your
subconscious blind your judgment.

449
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,810
Werther has to come, obviously.

450
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:11,550
- What did she say?
- Nothing. She doesn't know.

451
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,854
- Is she feeling ill?
- Sure.

452
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:16,726
But she thinks
she's going to be a mom.

453
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:20,798
Good God. Did you examine her?

454
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:23,529
No, she refused.
I only looked at her eyes.

455
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:27,562
Bernhard, Hanna is no case for you.

456
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,733
You normally examine with your reason...

457
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,834
and here you use your heart.

458
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:34,573
And the heart is like
a magnifying lens.

459
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:36,638
I'll go and see Hanna.

460
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:38,547
Dr. Burckhardt.

461
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:41,985
- See to it that Werther examines her.
- Yes.

462
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:46,219
I'm going home.

463
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:49,784
When I'm done,
should I phone you with the results?

464
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,523
No, don't. Come, Bernhard.

465
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:53,258
Good-bye.

466
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,740
Thomas.

467
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:38,040
You've brought me flowers?

468
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:40,443
What a surprise.

469
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:44,674
You always give me nice things.

470
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,813
You're smarter than we thought.

471
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,222
- Who's we?
- Berta and I.

472
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,226
How nice-

473
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,690
That silly hand.

474
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,368
You should have yourself examined.

475
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:06,769
Do you think so?

476
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,501
Bernhard thinks so too,
but I didn't want to.

477
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,702
But if you say so-

478
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:14,042
Sure.

479
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,944
What are you thinking?

480
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:18,710
Don't tell me.

481
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,616
I'm always thinking it too.

482
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,589
The diagnosis is correct, unfortunately.

483
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:37,392
No doubt, it is a severe
and incurable type.

484
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,301
What a shame.

485
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,465
Are you going to tell your wife?

486
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,943
- Don't tell her.
- I don't know-

487
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:50,107
Absolutely not.

488
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:53,619
Is like telling a prisoner
the date of his execution.

489
00:35:53,686 --> 00:35:57,520
- You can determine the date?
- Of course not.

490
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:03,085
There's no way of telling,
but Mrs. Heyt is seriously ill.

491
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:08,130
Such patients are often euphoric
to the last moment.

492
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:10,032
Nobody knows why...

493
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,500
but it may be a factor
in accelerating death.

494
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:19,941
How do you assess
the progression of the illness?

495
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:23,281
Well-

496
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:25,978
We're colleagues.
Don't hold back.

497
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,847
First, her legs will be paralyzed,
and she won't be able to walk.

498
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,255
Then she'll lose her arms
and have to be fed.

499
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:37,353
Everything beautiful in life,
nothing will be spared!

500
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,455
What can be done?

501
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,864
Rest, arsenic treatment.

502
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:45,461
I'm not giving up. I won't think of it.
I'll fight it.

503
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:48,006
My lab is one of the finest.

504
00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:51,908
Nerve specialists don't agree
on the origin of the disease, right?

505
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:54,139
- Unfortunately not.
- There you go.

506
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:57,774
I've informed myself.
Maybe you're too specialized.

507
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,512
Maybe the cause is
to be found in another area.

508
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,554
It could be a blood disease.

509
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:04,920
I know is your specialty...

510
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:09,189
but how can you link that
to multiple sclerosis?

511
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:12,425
The central nervous system
is not only made of nerve tissue.

512
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:14,489
There are fluids as well.

513
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,899
Maybe some deficiencies
in the blood create substances...

514
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:21,736
that, directly or indirectly,
destroy the nervous system.

515
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:24,972
Original, and highly interesting.

516
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:27,807
But this work would take years.

517
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,677
Maybe I can do it faster with luck.

518
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:31,273
I won't give up.

519
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,284
Of course not.

520
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:35,843
A real doctor never gives up.

521
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:38,720
And pardon me for saying so...

522
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,957
a loving one doesn't either.

523
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:46,121
- Anything else I can do?
- Thank you, Professor.

524
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:49,690
- I'll request some material.
- You'll get anything you want.

525
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:53,395
- Good-bye.
- I'll see you out.

526
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:02,604
In my estimation, her paralysis
is progressing rapidly.

527
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:05,583
Once it reaches her respiratory system,
the choking spells will start.

528
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:25,437
No, damn it!

529
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:33,267
You must think I'm crazy.

530
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,942
The moment has passed.

531
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:39,678
- Thomas-
- Just don't tell me to be reasonable!

532
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:42,744
Just don't tell me I'll come to terms!

533
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:44,483
I know that one.

534
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:47,048
I've told patients
the same thing myself.

535
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:51,062
- You're not giving up?
- Of course not, but this is something new.

536
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,064
First, I believed in diseases...

537
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:54,622
treatable diseases.

538
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,362
But then I realized these are
only words, names.

539
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:59,927
In reality, there are only sick people.

540
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:04,204
But now if I imagine
I'm fighting multiple sclerosis...

541
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:07,177
then is a disease again,
attacking Hanna.

542
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:11,410
A word, a term, nothing real,
something I can't touch.

543
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:16,421
What is this substanceless
monster that is sneaking up?

544
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:23,089
- But thas our profession.
- Our profession.

545
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:25,824
If I must lie to myself,
in order to lie to my sick patients.

546
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:28,230
Kindly refrain from lying to me too,
I'm not sick.

547
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,134
Not yet, but pull yourself together.

548
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:38,040
We'll hire two more technical
assistants and Rueger will help us.

549
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:44,341
- Maybe a pathogen is the cause.
- But no one has found it yet.

550
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:49,912
- People often find what others overlooked.
- Yes, Dr. Burckhardt.

551
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:51,479
Why couldn't we find the pathogen?

552
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:55,857
Leave nothing out, maybe is
cerebrospinal fluid or blood changes.

553
00:39:56,629 --> 00:39:58,460
Les summarize.

554
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:00,590
You, Dr. Burckhardt
are in charge of histology...

555
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:03,260
Dr. Höfer will handle the cultures...

556
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:06,202
and I'll run tests
on the cerebrospinal fluid.

557
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:08,536
If he's lucky, he'll find something.

558
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:13,603
But should he use his lab
for private research?

559
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,169
Is not private.

560
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:19,980
If he finds something, he's not just
helping Hanna, but thousands.

561
00:40:20,052 --> 00:40:23,544
Do you think it possible,
he'll find something in time?

562
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,690
A crap shoot.

563
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:31,095
We talked to Werther in detail.

564
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:36,362
He says is the nerves.

565
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:46,774
He doesn't think is-

566
00:40:46,846 --> 00:40:48,336
No, Hanna.

567
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:50,845
I don't want to lie to you.

568
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,578
He doesn't think you're having a baby.

569
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:04,355
I was so looking forward to it.

570
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,500
Is all pointless now.

571
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,498
But Hanna.

572
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:14,937
Hanna!

573
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:22,871
My God. Hanna!

574
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:07,084
- How many sections, Doctor?
- About a hundred.

575
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:08,847
Can your colleague help me?

576
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:13,952
- If he doesn't faint.
- I've never fainted, Doctor.

577
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:15,516
Not even during the first semester.

578
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,757
Don't let her fluster you.

579
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:22,164
She only wants to demonstrate
the strength of women.

580
00:43:22,234 --> 00:43:24,998
Come with me in the tiger's den.
Bring your records.

581
00:43:46,158 --> 00:43:48,251
We've finally done it.

582
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:51,125
The mouse has been infected.

583
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:54,960
Dr. Burckhardt. Come quick.

584
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:57,059
Yes, whas going on?

585
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:01,306
Look.

586
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:03,967
The mouse is paralyzed.
Great, isn't it?

587
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,770
Poor animal.

588
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:11,405
The first success in three weeks,
and she says, "Poor animal."

589
00:44:18,457 --> 00:44:19,947
There.

590
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:24,452
Be good. Take your medicine.

591
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,591
I think you're using me
as your guinea pig or something.

592
00:44:36,342 --> 00:44:40,836
What is my disease?
Don't you know?

593
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:44,906
- Not exactly.
- But it can't go on like this.

594
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:47,349
I can't move either leg...

595
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:50,752
and my right arm is acting up too.

596
00:44:50,823 --> 00:44:55,624
I can't spend my life
lying around paralyzed like that.

597
00:44:56,462 --> 00:44:58,487
Maybe we'll find a good treatment.

598
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:01,796
- Are you thinking about it?
- Of course.

599
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:05,933
- Is that why you look so tired?
- No.

600
00:45:06,605 --> 00:45:09,574
- You can tell me.
- No, Hanna.

601
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:12,337
I spent the last two nights
watching over a child.

602
00:45:12,411 --> 00:45:16,677
- What child?
- One with meningitis.

603
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:20,981
I need to be there because the child
may require heart medication.

604
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:22,953
Does it help?

605
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:26,549
Maybe the child will survive.

606
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:33,227
Is hard to imagine there are
others who are sick too.

607
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:35,628
Strange.

608
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:38,465
- I'm not all that sick.
- No.

609
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,567
You're a good doctor, right?

610
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:47,940
- And Thomas?
- He's a researcher.

611
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:52,450
I can help individuals if I'm lucky.
He helps thousands.

612
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:58,450
Does he think of me too
when he works?

613
00:45:58,524 --> 00:46:02,221
- All the time.
- Yes?

614
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:06,459
He comes home really late now.

615
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:09,228
New research, he says.

616
00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:16,202
Is he thinking of the healthy Hanna
who doesn't exist anymore?

617
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:21,406
Why don't you answer me?

618
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:25,717
You know how he thinks of you.

619
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:28,485
You, the way you are.

620
00:46:28,554 --> 00:46:31,523
- How long has the test been?
- Four weeks now, Professor.

621
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,922
- Still the only sick mouse?
- Yes.

622
00:46:34,593 --> 00:46:37,790
Then its paralysis was probably
caused by injury from the injection.

623
00:46:37,863 --> 00:46:39,797
Too bad.

624
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:43,858
We need to run a new test.

625
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,768
Try a brain mash
instead of injections.

626
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,330
Yes, Professor.

627
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:53,771
- How many sections left to analyze?
- About 120.

628
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:56,406
It needs to be done.
You have time?

629
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:58,211
Of course.

630
00:46:59,718 --> 00:47:02,710
I think we're over the hump.
The fever is gone.

631
00:47:02,788 --> 00:47:04,779
Doctor! L-

632
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:08,786
Don't celebrate yet.
There may be a relapse.

633
00:47:08,861 --> 00:47:12,388
But I'm happy too.
I think it will be good now.

634
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,670
Immersion.

635
00:47:29,982 --> 00:47:32,576
- How can you stand it?
- No wonder with me...

636
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:35,950
but you, I'm grateful to you.

637
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,182
10:00, and he hasn't called.

638
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:40,725
He doesn't have time to think.

639
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:43,590
But you're supposed
to think of him all day.

640
00:47:44,296 --> 00:47:47,288
Half of that crazy disease
comes from him not being here.

641
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:49,197
Stop it, Berta.

642
00:47:49,268 --> 00:47:51,566
Or I'll send you away
and won't speak to you.

643
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:54,171
Hanna.

644
00:47:55,274 --> 00:47:57,174
I mean well.

645
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:02,402
Sure, the professor.
I shouldn't say anything.

646
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:07,608
See? He's here now.

647
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:13,087
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Berta.

648
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:17,090
Good evening, Hanna.

649
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:24,099
- Haven't you eaten yet?
- No, I've waited for you.

650
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:27,332
I'm tracking something important.

651
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:30,068
And time is of the essence.
I'm sorry.

652
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:38,239
- I'd like to take a trip with you.
- We will soon. To Munich.

653
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:42,085
No.

654
00:48:42,154 --> 00:48:44,816
I want to go to a land
where there is no disease.

655
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:05,074
Poor animal.
I haven't forgotten you.

656
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:13,848
There.
Soon you'll feel no more pain.

657
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:19,646
Is nice of you
to always come yourself.

658
00:49:21,493 --> 00:49:23,586
Is just a pretext for me.

659
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:29,363
If you leave the bottle,
will you still visit?

660
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,767
Don't tempt me.

661
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,570
Leave the bottle here.

662
00:49:37,643 --> 00:49:41,977
See what you made me do?
Now there are too many drops.

663
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:45,483
One more or less won't matter.

664
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,040
You don't understand that.

665
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:14,968
Now I know.

666
00:50:15,981 --> 00:50:17,846
You're poisoning me.

667
00:50:18,684 --> 00:50:21,847
You know I'm seriously ill,
and you're all keeping it from me.

668
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,013
I've felt it.

669
00:50:24,923 --> 00:50:28,324
You're afraid to leave the bottle.

670
00:50:28,994 --> 00:50:33,090
I might drink it all at once,
silly as I am.

671
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:36,191
I still have courage.

672
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:38,759
I still believe I'll get better.

673
00:50:38,837 --> 00:50:41,397
But you don't.

674
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,674
At least tell me
the Latin name of my disease.

675
00:50:46,745 --> 00:50:48,542
How would that help you?

676
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:53,412
You won't? Thomas will tell me.

677
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:59,781
But I want to ask you
for something else.

678
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:05,289
Now, while I still can,
because I don't think ill happen...

679
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:09,794
but I ask you,
just for the worst case...

680
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:13,100
if I keep getting worse-

681
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:16,231
I can see whas coming.

682
00:51:16,308 --> 00:51:19,505
My legs are paralyzed,
the left arm is gone...

683
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:21,443
the right one's starting to go.

684
00:51:22,114 --> 00:51:27,051
You know, I am not afraid of dying,
but I don't want to just lie there.

685
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,785
For years, not being human,
but only a lump of meat.

686
00:51:32,858 --> 00:51:35,258
It would be a torment for Thomas
if I deteriorated like that.

687
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,320
And when he thinks of me...

688
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,259
when I'm dead...

689
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:43,928
he'll be glad.

690
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:48,164
And I don't want that at all.

691
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,403
- You're my best friend.
- Always.

692
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:54,843
Then forget to take
the bottle with you.

693
00:51:55,881 --> 00:51:57,940
You're mad.

694
00:51:58,016 --> 00:51:59,574
Surely, you're not that sick.

695
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:04,486
Promise me that you'll help me when I am.

696
00:52:04,556 --> 00:52:09,289
Promise me that you'll
spare Thomas and me.

697
00:52:10,796 --> 00:52:12,457
Listen, Hanna.

698
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:15,391
I'm your best friend.

699
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:20,302
But I'm also a doctor,
and a doctor is a servant of life.

700
00:52:20,372 --> 00:52:23,034
He must preserve it at all costs.

701
00:52:23,108 --> 00:52:26,908
May a doctor delay death if he can?

702
00:52:27,746 --> 00:52:29,236
Of course.

703
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:33,580
But he must not shorten
the pain of death?

704
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:36,120
- No.
- Why not?

705
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:41,455
Because we don't know
what death is.

706
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:45,322
We don't even know what life is.

707
00:52:45,397 --> 00:52:48,332
Life creates the body...

708
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,494
and the body creates
the mind and soul.

709
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:56,964
As long as the body lives,
things can still improve.

710
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:05,373
Thas very well thought out.

711
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:10,915
There.

712
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:12,957
We think is a new pathogen.

713
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:18,390
Well done.

714
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,398
But it has nothing to do
with multiple sclerosis.

715
00:53:21,466 --> 00:53:23,161
Unfortunately, no.

716
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:27,215
- So what will you do with it?
- We'll try to cultivate it.

717
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,239
With what?

718
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:31,537
We use tissue cultures. Look.

719
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:37,545
Well, I'll be! Thas great.

720
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:44,045
You just did that on the side.
Your boss must be proud.

721
00:53:44,122 --> 00:53:45,953
No, he's disappointed.

722
00:53:46,024 --> 00:53:47,787
He's only thinking of his wife.

723
00:53:47,859 --> 00:53:49,588
Yes, that would cloud his judgment.

724
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,764
What do you do as part
of your experiments?

725
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:01,499
You wouldn't understand, child.

726
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:06,636
Thomas, I understand precisely.

727
00:54:06,711 --> 00:54:09,111
You're trying to find
a cure for my disease.

728
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:12,616
Yes.

729
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:17,953
Is nice that this is the reason
you leave me all alone.

730
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:23,394
So you're also thinking of me
when you're at the lab.

731
00:54:24,596 --> 00:54:27,087
The disease is incurable?

732
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:30,860
No, Hanna.

733
00:54:31,536 --> 00:54:35,632
You can tell me the truth.
I believe in you.

734
00:54:36,308 --> 00:54:39,675
I know you'll succeed.

735
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:41,939
I'll be patient.

736
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:49,947
Why are you giving me poison?

737
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:54,084
To buy time for my work.

738
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:58,320
So, it is incurable.

739
00:54:59,831 --> 00:55:02,026
For the time being.

740
00:55:12,377 --> 00:55:15,813
Sometimes I've felt so sick...

741
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,007
and I've never told you.

742
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:21,083
I've even thought...

743
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:25,384
"If I die now,
he won't be here with me."

744
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:28,689
Thas the worst.

745
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:31,525
Promise me, Thomas...

746
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:34,531
if the disease is faster than you...

747
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:36,464
don't leave me alone.

748
00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:39,833
No, don't say anything.

749
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:44,603
When I get worse, you must help me.

750
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:48,510
You must help me remain
your Hanna...

751
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,241
to the very end.

752
00:55:50,315 --> 00:55:52,806
Before I turn into something else...

753
00:55:52,884 --> 00:55:55,751
deaf, blind or demented.

754
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:58,546
I couldn't bear that.

755
00:56:00,392 --> 00:56:05,887
You would then have to learn
to love another woman.

756
00:56:07,265 --> 00:56:09,927
And it would hurt me so much.

757
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:16,000
Promise me, Thomas,
that you'll release me before that.

758
00:56:16,975 --> 00:56:21,503
Do it, Thomas,
if you really love me.

759
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:23,513
Do it.

760
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:26,877
L-

761
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:30,387
I'll make you healthy again.

762
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:35,715
Still nothing.

763
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,459
And Hanna?

764
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,927
The disease is progressing rapidly.

765
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:46,732
Is there any hope left?

766
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:50,806
Is a race.
A race against death.

767
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:18,502
Of course I'm very sick, Eduard.

768
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,367
I know that.

769
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:25,698
But inside, I'm healthy...

770
00:57:27,212 --> 00:57:29,703
because I believe in Thomas.

771
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:33,914
- Don't you?
- Yes, I do.

772
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,879
I believe in his abilities.

773
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:41,324
He will help me.

774
00:57:42,227 --> 00:57:44,787
One way or the other.

775
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:22,298
- Is this the first new test series?
- Yes.

776
00:58:24,903 --> 00:58:26,734
Take a look.

777
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:43,319
Either I'm crazy,
or I really see something.

778
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:51,251
You're right. A silver lattice.

779
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:54,162
You see it too?
In both preparations?

780
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:55,995
Yes.

781
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:58,160
Here too.

782
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:00,500
- Take another one.
- Same for my other sections.

783
00:59:03,341 --> 00:59:05,468
They could be elementary bodies.

784
00:59:06,778 --> 00:59:07,676
They must be.

785
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:10,077
I think is the pathogen.

786
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,782
My God.

787
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:27,761
What do you see?

788
00:59:27,832 --> 00:59:30,528
A caterpillar-like silver lattice.

789
00:59:30,602 --> 00:59:33,093
Axon cylinders intact.
Myelin destroyed.

790
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:38,467
Connected hexagonal plates.

791
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:40,804
Some are striped.

792
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:45,638
Bundles of needle-shaped crystals.

793
00:59:45,717 --> 00:59:48,652
A perfect match for what I observed.

794
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,451
- What do you think it is?
- Elementary bodies of a virus.

795
00:59:52,523 --> 00:59:55,856
Much like small pox. Multiple sclerosis!!

796
01:00:00,999 --> 01:00:02,660
Excuse me, please.

797
01:00:27,258 --> 01:00:28,258
Yes?

798
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:35,694
Excuse me.

799
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:43,198
Dr. Burckhardt? You're here?

800
01:00:43,274 --> 01:00:45,367
Yes. Who are you?

801
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:49,703
Oh, Mr. Stretter.

802
01:00:49,781 --> 01:00:52,716
The professor is over there.

803
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:59,656
- Do you always work late?
- Right now, yes.

804
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:02,550
Yes, I thought so.

805
01:01:03,528 --> 01:01:05,506
You'll find the professor
behind that door over there.

806
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,054
Thank you.

807
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:12,927
Is quite interesting,
a lab like this.

808
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:22,944
Yes?

809
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:27,877
Well, well.

810
01:01:30,221 --> 01:01:33,418
- You're a sight.
- Why?

811
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:40,423
You're totally exhausted.

812
01:01:40,498 --> 01:01:42,159
Guess what.

813
01:01:42,233 --> 01:01:44,292
I think we've isolated the disease.

814
01:01:45,503 --> 01:01:48,631
- We who?
- Barbara and I.

815
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:56,944
- Is about Hanna's health.
- Stop pretending.

816
01:01:57,014 --> 01:02:02,179
- Whas wrong?
- Not my business, but you have good taste.

817
01:02:04,322 --> 01:02:05,983
I don't know what you want.

818
01:02:07,325 --> 01:02:09,919
I know what people are like.

819
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:12,189
Drop your act.

820
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:14,892
But I pity Hanna.

821
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:18,191
Poor Hanna.

822
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,963
Leave Hanna out of this.

823
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:27,504
What I've seen here
is all I need to know.

824
01:02:30,348 --> 01:02:33,579
- I was right after all.
- Of course.

825
01:02:33,651 --> 01:02:36,916
The healthy one
is always right, Thomas.

826
01:03:17,562 --> 01:03:19,393
Have you been crying?

827
01:03:21,232 --> 01:03:26,226
No. I still have hope.

828
01:03:26,304 --> 01:03:30,798
I'll cure you, Hanna.
I just isolated the pathogen.

829
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:35,302
- Yes?
- Barbara thinks so too. She's objective.

830
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:38,371
We saw it at least a dozen times.

831
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:40,383
I'm so happy.

832
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:45,179
Oh, Thomas.

833
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:58,257
I can't move my arm anymore.

834
01:03:58,336 --> 01:04:03,501
- Calm down.
- I can't move my arms.

835
01:04:03,574 --> 01:04:05,804
I told you.

836
01:04:05,877 --> 01:04:09,369
You will walk again.
You will raise your arms again.

837
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:12,280
I'll work the whole night.
I'll go back to the lab.

838
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,012
No, stay here.

839
01:04:15,086 --> 01:04:20,786
I am always afraid I may die
when you're not here.

840
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:27,997
- It is too late now anyway.
- Don't say that. No.

841
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:30,260
Help me, Thomas.

842
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:33,870
Help me.

843
01:04:35,273 --> 01:04:36,763
I'll cure you.

844
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:44,505
- You worked all night?
- Yes. I'm wonderfully tired.

845
01:04:44,582 --> 01:04:47,244
Success makes for really good sleep.

846
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:49,149
I'll take a look and make
new preparations.

847
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,279
Go home and rest on your laurels.

848
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:54,620
I'll just let the boss know.

849
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:04,823
No need to console me today, Pastor.

850
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:08,235
I'll be dancing again
two months from now.

851
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:10,831
I'll play a waltz for you then.

852
01:05:13,144 --> 01:05:18,810
I think anyone as gay as your are
must be devout as well.

853
01:05:20,518 --> 01:05:22,577
You won't get me like that, Pastor.

854
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:25,847
But it sounds nice.

855
01:05:26,524 --> 01:05:31,257
My pain is only half as bad,
now that I know I will be cured.

856
01:05:50,748 --> 01:05:52,511
I see it.

857
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:58,454
This pathogen has nothing
to do with multiple sclerosis.

858
01:06:00,858 --> 01:06:03,122
I'm sorry, Professor.

859
01:06:03,194 --> 01:06:06,357
But is still a great discovery.

860
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:12,059
Substances of the new agent likely
combined with the destroyed tissue.

861
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:15,299
This will open up new possibilities
in histological diagnostics.

862
01:06:15,373 --> 01:06:17,432
New possibilities?

863
01:06:17,508 --> 01:06:20,341
For you, perhaps, but not for me.

864
01:06:21,012 --> 01:06:23,037
You can go to Munich in my place.

865
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:24,877
But Professor.

866
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,809
Please leave me alone.

867
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:44,764
You see, Hanna?

868
01:06:44,835 --> 01:06:46,769
Everything will be all right.

869
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:49,169
A doctor must never give up hope.

870
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,208
Miracles do happen sometimes.

871
01:06:59,984 --> 01:07:03,818
- Am I dying?
- No, Hanna.

872
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:06,888
Call Thomas.

873
01:07:06,957 --> 01:07:07,957
Yes, Hanna.

874
01:07:11,362 --> 01:07:14,024
Leave it.
I don't want to be disturbed.

875
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:28,970
I'll get the professor.
He won't answer the phone.

876
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:37,376
- Professor! Come quick!
- Whas wrong?

877
01:07:37,455 --> 01:07:39,423
I think is the end.

878
01:07:46,931 --> 01:07:49,627
He's coming.

879
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:00,467
Thomas.

880
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:03,240
I can't-

881
01:08:03,314 --> 01:08:06,010
I can't take it anymore.

882
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,142
Stay calm.

883
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:10,483
I'll talk to Bernhard.
He'll help you.

884
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:15,218
No, don't go away.

885
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,953
I'll stay here.

886
01:08:17,027 --> 01:08:20,053
It won't take long.

887
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:52,718
Tell me the truth.
What is her condition?

888
01:08:54,064 --> 01:08:56,897
- The final stage.
- You know that for sure?

889
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:58,958
I've seen it many times.

890
01:08:59,036 --> 01:09:02,062
- How much longer?
- Two months.

891
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:04,630
- Two months of terrible pain?
- Yes.

892
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:06,767
And it can't be stopped?

893
01:09:06,844 --> 01:09:09,711
- Can we keep it from her?
- Not anymore.

894
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:11,441
What can we do?

895
01:09:12,116 --> 01:09:15,051
Keep her calm. Morphine.

896
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,951
Thank you for your candor.

897
01:10:05,236 --> 01:10:07,170
I'll give you your medicine now.

898
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:10,833
So you can sleep.

899
01:10:10,908 --> 01:10:14,344
Yes, Thomas.

900
01:10:41,605 --> 01:10:45,905
It has a very bitter taste.

901
01:10:53,584 --> 01:10:57,577
I'm so tired now.

902
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:01,584
So happy.

903
01:11:08,132 --> 01:11:11,659
Remember, Thomas...

904
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:18,337
how I came to you...

905
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:25,877
after running away from home...

906
01:11:27,685 --> 01:11:32,452
and I was so afraid...

907
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:38,827
we sat just like this.

908
01:11:44,702 --> 01:11:49,571
I feel so light...

909
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:54,675
so happy...

910
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,371
like never before.

911
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,512
I wish...

912
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:11,185
this was death.

913
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:21,561
It is death, Hanna.

914
01:12:26,076 --> 01:12:32,447
How I love you, Thomas.

915
01:12:38,055 --> 01:12:40,046
I wish...

916
01:12:41,992 --> 01:12:46,088
I could take your hand...

917
01:12:52,002 --> 01:12:56,063
I love you, Hanna.

918
01:12:59,043 --> 01:13:04,345
I love you, Thomas.

919
01:13:25,903 --> 01:13:28,303
Why are the lights off?

920
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,576
Hanna is dead.

921
01:14:09,246 --> 01:14:10,543
Did you kill her?

922
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:15,848
Set her free.

923
01:14:16,687 --> 01:14:19,178
Set her free?

924
01:14:19,256 --> 01:14:21,747
Is that what you call it?

925
01:14:25,996 --> 01:14:28,362
Thomas, what have you done?

926
01:14:29,233 --> 01:14:30,495
You've murdered her!

927
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:37,630
Don't talk now!
I know every word you would say!

928
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:40,700
You took the most precious thing
from her, her life.

929
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:44,372
As a doctor,
you have lost your honor.

930
01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:47,881
You never loved her.
I know that now.

931
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:52,183
She asked me too, but because
I loved her, I didn't do it.

932
01:14:54,725 --> 01:14:59,389
Because I loved her more, I did it.

933
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:02,855
Because her suffering was inhumane...

934
01:15:02,933 --> 01:15:06,528
because man must be above death...

935
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,696
thas why I set her free.

936
01:15:12,543 --> 01:15:14,511
Thas it, Thomas.

937
01:15:14,578 --> 01:15:16,910
I'm through with you.

938
01:15:17,614 --> 01:15:20,048
I never want to see you again.

939
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:35,526
Oh, Berta.

940
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:23,209
He killed her.

941
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:27,341
He said so himself.
And Bernhard said so too.

942
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:34,789
- Are you coming with us?
- No, to the police.

943
01:16:41,398 --> 01:16:44,890
It complicates
the assessment of your case.

944
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:47,266
It could be disastrous for you...

945
01:16:47,337 --> 01:16:50,306
if you don't tell us how it happened.

946
01:16:50,374 --> 01:16:55,073
How can we pass fair judgment
if you won't end your silence?

947
01:16:55,946 --> 01:16:58,210
You are charged with murder.

948
01:17:02,185 --> 01:17:07,316
Isn't there anything important
that the court should know?

949
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:11,825
You must have had a motive
for your actions.

950
01:17:14,731 --> 01:17:16,858
I loved my wife very much.

951
01:17:24,608 --> 01:17:25,802
And?

952
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:41,555
- Les hear from the witnesses.
- Maybe we'll find some discrepancies.

953
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,525
Witness Stretter, please.

954
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,525
Witness Stretter.

955
01:17:48,598 --> 01:17:53,092
I bet he gave her some medicine
he invented to try it out...

956
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:56,765
- and he doesn't want to admit it.
- Highly unlikely.

957
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:11,621
Director Eduard Stretter, age 42,
the deceased was your sister.

958
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:14,919
- You can refuse to testify.
- I want to testify.

959
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:20,727
Tell us first about the relationship
between Mr. And Mrs. Heyt.

960
01:18:20,797 --> 01:18:25,234
How did the accused
meet your sister?

961
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:28,867
We had known Thomas
since childhood.

962
01:18:28,939 --> 01:18:33,000
We moved to northern Germany,
while he studied in Innsbruck.

963
01:18:33,076 --> 01:18:35,738
My sister was still a young girl
when Thomas lost his practice...

964
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:39,976
- due to his medical views.
- We're aware of that.

965
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:43,110
He was in a bad way and came here
because his friend Dr. Lang...

966
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:47,179
who approves of his views,
was willing to support him.

967
01:18:47,257 --> 01:18:52,194
He then met my sister again,
who had turned 20.

968
01:18:52,262 --> 01:18:58,132
He managed to influence her,
and she ran away from home.

969
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:02,035
How did he do that?
Do you have more details?

970
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:07,805
She had childhood memories
that he took advantage of.

971
01:19:07,878 --> 01:19:12,212
He seemed to care mainly about
her money, because he wasn't doing well.

972
01:19:12,282 --> 01:19:15,445
My father reduced her share
to the legal portion in his last will...

973
01:19:15,519 --> 01:19:17,487
and he died soon after...

974
01:19:17,554 --> 01:19:20,955
probably still haunted
by these events.

975
01:19:21,024 --> 01:19:23,618
Still, she inherited a substantial sum.

976
01:19:24,728 --> 01:19:27,959
I think he was mainly interested
in her money.

977
01:19:28,632 --> 01:19:30,122
He'd never had money.

978
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:35,160
You know that Professor Heyt
sacrificed his own health for months...

979
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:39,106
working in his lab day and night
to save his wife.

980
01:19:39,176 --> 01:19:42,475
- You saw it yourself. You were there.
- Yes, thas right.

981
01:19:42,546 --> 01:19:46,710
But Dr. Burckhardt worked there too,
and their relationship...

982
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:49,946
- went beyond the job.
- What makes you say that?

983
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:54,184
Dr. Burckhardt also worked
at the lab day and night...

984
01:19:54,257 --> 01:19:57,226
sacrificing her own health.

985
01:19:57,894 --> 01:20:02,593
My sister was sick for a long time,
but she still clung to life.

986
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:04,759
- And to her husband.
- Unfortunately, yes.

987
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:08,703
So you reported Professor Heyt
to the authorities...

988
01:20:08,772 --> 01:20:11,605
because, based on your
personal conclusions...

989
01:20:11,675 --> 01:20:14,610
you thought he wanted to kill her?

990
01:20:14,678 --> 01:20:18,637
I knew Professor Heyt since childhood
as an excessive, brutal character.

991
01:20:18,715 --> 01:20:21,980
He beat you up many times
when you were young. I know.

992
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:33,028
- Any more questions for the witness?
- Not at this time.

993
01:20:33,096 --> 01:20:35,087
- Defense counsel?
- Yes, please.

994
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:43,569
Director, do you think it is possible
that the sick woman asked my client...

995
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,301
to help her die?

996
01:20:46,142 --> 01:20:48,337
Is it possible?

997
01:20:53,183 --> 01:20:56,118
- Yes.
- Thank you.

998
01:20:58,555 --> 01:21:01,080
Director, please be seated.

999
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:04,391
Witness Helmut Höfer.

1000
01:21:07,397 --> 01:21:09,331
Witness Höfer.

1001
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:14,603
- Simple case of murder.
- I don't think so.

1002
01:21:17,274 --> 01:21:22,837
Witness Dr. Helmut Höfer, age 28,
assistant, not related to the accused.

1003
01:21:22,913 --> 01:21:26,781
You work at the lab of Professor Heyt.

1004
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:29,683
- For how long?
- Three and a half years.

1005
01:21:29,753 --> 01:21:32,916
- You knew Mrs. Heyt?
- Yes.

1006
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:36,015
What was the professor's
relationship with his wife?

1007
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:41,595
He-

1008
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:47,231
He loved her more than anything.

1009
01:21:48,572 --> 01:21:50,665
You had help at the lab?

1010
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:54,005
Yes, a technical assistant,
and Dr, Burckhardt, of course.

1011
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:58,138
Dr. Burckhardt is a hard worker?

1012
01:21:58,815 --> 01:22:03,752
Yes, diligent.
Very smart for a woman I mean.

1013
01:22:06,156 --> 01:22:09,956
Do you know about Dr. Burckhards
personal circumstances?

1014
01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:12,153
Dr. Burckhardt?

1015
01:22:13,296 --> 01:22:14,786
Why?

1016
01:22:14,864 --> 01:22:17,059
No. Personal circumstances?

1017
01:22:17,133 --> 01:22:20,296
Well, did she have a closer
relationship with Professor Heyt?

1018
01:22:21,705 --> 01:22:23,570
Yes.

1019
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,904
No, I mean-

1020
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:31,372
- Do I have to answer that?
- You have to tell us what you know.

1021
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:36,749
Well, it is possible...

1022
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:41,951
that Dr. Burckhardt
admired the professor.

1023
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:45,791
- I mean, admire, but-
- But what?

1024
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:50,497
- Professor Heyt never noticed.
- How's that?

1025
01:22:50,567 --> 01:22:55,937
He loved his wife so much,
he never looked at another woman.

1026
01:22:56,006 --> 01:23:02,912
Do you know if Mrs. Heyt
asked her husband expressly...

1027
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:05,106
to help her die?

1028
01:23:05,181 --> 01:23:06,512
No.

1029
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:11,309
But is possible.

1030
01:23:11,388 --> 01:23:12,388
Yes.

1031
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:17,853
Thank you, Doctor.

1032
01:23:19,362 --> 01:23:21,830
Dr. Burckhardt.

1033
01:23:26,036 --> 01:23:28,129
Dr. Burckhardt.

1034
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,640
- Dr. Burckhardt, your first name?
- Barbara.

1035
01:23:40,717 --> 01:23:43,379
- How old are you?
- 26.

1036
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:47,947
You've worked in Professor Heys
laboratory for about two years.

1037
01:23:48,024 --> 01:23:49,685
Yes.

1038
01:23:49,759 --> 01:23:52,250
- You have a lot of work.
- Fortunately, yes.

1039
01:23:52,328 --> 01:23:55,354
You like working for Professor Heyt?

1040
01:23:55,432 --> 01:23:57,423
If you mean the workload.

1041
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:03,769
Professor Heyt is a genius.
We'd often work day and night.

1042
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,468
He did keep his lecture schedule.

1043
01:24:06,543 --> 01:24:08,909
Sometimes, things were slower.

1044
01:24:08,978 --> 01:24:12,914
Do you know if Mrs. Heyt was
understanding of his obsession for work?

1045
01:24:14,084 --> 01:24:16,416
You mean if she suffered.

1046
01:24:16,486 --> 01:24:18,147
Yes, of course.

1047
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:21,088
But that was even more reason
for her to love her husband.

1048
01:24:21,157 --> 01:24:23,648
You thought it was a happy marriage?

1049
01:24:23,727 --> 01:24:26,924
Ideal, the only happy marriage I know.

1050
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:33,430
Can you tell us more about
Professor Heys character?

1051
01:24:33,503 --> 01:24:36,370
How is he as a person?

1052
01:24:39,576 --> 01:24:43,774
I believe only a truly great man
can be a truly great researcher.

1053
01:24:43,847 --> 01:24:46,042
How was your work with Dr. Höfer?

1054
01:24:46,116 --> 01:24:49,779
He is, of course, highly competent.

1055
01:24:49,853 --> 01:24:51,844
How do you know?

1056
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:55,084
Professor Heyt would only hire
especially competent staff.

1057
01:24:56,459 --> 01:24:57,790
Thas right.

1058
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:03,021
- I didn't mean it like that.
- We know what you mean.

1059
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:07,329
One more question.
You knew Mrs. Heyt.

1060
01:25:08,371 --> 01:25:15,675
Do you think it possible Mrs. Heyt
expressly asked him to help her die?

1061
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:20,215
Yes.

1062
01:25:20,283 --> 01:25:24,947
Are you aware of any such
express request by Mrs. Heyt?

1063
01:25:25,021 --> 01:25:27,717
I wasn't there, Mr. Prosecutor.

1064
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:33,054
Thank you. Witness Berta Link.

1065
01:25:33,897 --> 01:25:35,558
Please have a seat.

1066
01:25:39,202 --> 01:25:41,693
Witness Berta Link.

1067
01:25:43,373 --> 01:25:45,102
Excuse me, Your Honor.

1068
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:48,472
I just remembered something.

1069
01:25:48,545 --> 01:25:50,137
Yes?

1070
01:25:51,114 --> 01:25:55,346
When I visited my sister
the day before her death...

1071
01:25:56,019 --> 01:25:57,509
she said to me...

1072
01:25:57,587 --> 01:26:00,852
"Thomas will help me.
One way or the other."

1073
01:26:00,924 --> 01:26:03,085
Your questions triggered my memory.

1074
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:06,890
This is very important, Mr. Stretter.
Thank you.

1075
01:26:13,102 --> 01:26:15,366
Ms. Link, please.

1076
01:26:16,573 --> 01:26:18,370
Three to one for Heyt.

1077
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:23,640
Berta Link, age 54.
Housekeeper at Professor Heys.

1078
01:26:23,713 --> 01:26:26,375
You know what your statement
means for Professor Heyt.

1079
01:26:26,449 --> 01:26:29,009
Stick to the truth.

1080
01:26:29,085 --> 01:26:33,522
Don't let feelings
make you stray from the truth.

1081
01:26:34,357 --> 01:26:37,588
You knew Mrs. Heyt from
the time she was a child, right?

1082
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:38,660
Yes.

1083
01:26:38,728 --> 01:26:40,286
Tell us.

1084
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:44,525
I worked as a cook in a hotel then.

1085
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:47,328
Or more like a kitchen maid.

1086
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:50,432
That is, I was being trained.

1087
01:26:50,506 --> 01:26:55,739
- When was that?
- 26, no, 27 years ago.

1088
01:26:55,812 --> 01:26:58,440
Don't start that far back.

1089
01:26:58,514 --> 01:27:00,505
When did you start
working for the Stretters?

1090
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:03,211
That was then.

1091
01:27:03,286 --> 01:27:06,551
It was Mr. Stretter.
The old Mr. Stretter.

1092
01:27:06,623 --> 01:27:08,682
He had some sweet dumplings
at the hotel...

1093
01:27:08,758 --> 01:27:11,352
and asked who'd made them.

1094
01:27:11,427 --> 01:27:14,590
Later, when he needed a cook,
he hired me.

1095
01:27:14,664 --> 01:27:19,658
- How old was Mrs. Heyt then?
- Hanna? She hadn't been born yet.

1096
01:27:19,736 --> 01:27:23,069
But Eduard was 12.

1097
01:27:23,139 --> 01:27:25,664
When was Hanna born?

1098
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:29,801
About a year later.

1099
01:27:29,879 --> 01:27:31,938
When did Mrs. Stretter die?

1100
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:37,513
She was five or six-

1101
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:41,014
Between Hanna's fifth and sixth birthday.

1102
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:42,580
- And then you-
- Yes.

1103
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:43,887
- What?
- Pardon?

1104
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:48,488
- You wanted to say something.
- No. L-

1105
01:27:48,564 --> 01:27:52,364
- After Mrs. Stretter's death, you-
- Yes.

1106
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:53,493
Yes, what?

1107
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:55,059
Yes, l-

1108
01:27:55,138 --> 01:27:59,438
I served as a mother to Hanna,
so to say.

1109
01:27:59,509 --> 01:28:00,874
Right.

1110
01:28:00,944 --> 01:28:05,404
When Hanna left her father
to go with Professor Heyt, you-

1111
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:08,245
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

1112
01:28:08,318 --> 01:28:11,048
I was-

1113
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,610
I went-

1114
01:28:12,689 --> 01:28:15,852
I went along with the child.

1115
01:28:15,925 --> 01:28:19,452
Because the old Mr. Stretter
was absolutely against it.

1116
01:28:19,529 --> 01:28:21,793
The poor child didn't have anyone.

1117
01:28:21,864 --> 01:28:24,958
Fine. Now tell us-

1118
01:28:26,269 --> 01:28:29,432
She was coughing
and couldn't breathe.

1119
01:28:30,606 --> 01:28:33,769
The professor sent me
to the kitchen...

1120
01:28:33,843 --> 01:28:35,868
and Dr. Lang was playing the piano.

1121
01:28:37,447 --> 01:28:42,714
Then they came down the stairs
and they were screaming.

1122
01:28:42,785 --> 01:28:46,744
Dr. Lang screamed,
"You murdered her!"

1123
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:50,688
The professor said...

1124
01:28:52,128 --> 01:28:54,653
"I have done it."

1125
01:28:54,731 --> 01:28:57,723
Be precise. What did he say?

1126
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:02,536
I'll never forget it.

1127
01:29:03,873 --> 01:29:05,932
The professor said...

1128
01:29:06,609 --> 01:29:11,069
"Because I loved her more, I did it."

1129
01:29:11,147 --> 01:29:12,739
More?

1130
01:29:12,815 --> 01:29:14,442
Well...

1131
01:29:14,517 --> 01:29:17,350
before that,
Dr. Lang had shouted...

1132
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:21,379
"Because I loved her, I didn't do it."

1133
01:29:21,457 --> 01:29:24,221
But this proves that the deceased
had asked both doctors for help.

1134
01:29:24,293 --> 01:29:29,788
Did she? You Herr Strahl, you know her.
She loved life.

1135
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:34,667
On her last day, she said
she'd dance again in two months.

1136
01:29:34,737 --> 01:29:39,640
Maybe then she'd thought that
Professor Heyt had found a cure.

1137
01:29:41,144 --> 01:29:42,805
Maybe.

1138
01:29:43,846 --> 01:29:46,337
No, no.

1139
01:29:47,683 --> 01:29:51,676
She was not a churchgoer,
but still pious.

1140
01:29:51,754 --> 01:29:56,350
She never made such a request.
Never did she ask for it!

1141
01:29:57,527 --> 01:29:59,620
Don't you want to respond?

1142
01:30:01,064 --> 01:30:03,157
May I ask a question?

1143
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:07,726
Where were you when you
heard the accused and Dr. Lang?

1144
01:30:07,804 --> 01:30:12,332
I heard them scream and ran out
of the kitchen and was behind the door.

1145
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:15,741
First, Bernhard screamed,
then the Professor said...

1146
01:30:15,812 --> 01:30:19,873
"Because I loved her more,
thas why I did it."

1147
01:30:21,384 --> 01:30:24,046
And he did it.

1148
01:30:25,354 --> 01:30:28,084
She was like my own child.

1149
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:31,090
She was always so happy.

1150
01:30:32,095 --> 01:30:34,290
Why did he have to-

1151
01:30:35,164 --> 01:30:38,497
Calm down. Take a seat.

1152
01:30:38,568 --> 01:30:40,263
Give her some water.

1153
01:30:40,937 --> 01:30:44,498
Is outrageous that witness
Dr. Lang cannot be located.

1154
01:30:45,174 --> 01:30:47,699
- You haven't heard from him?
- No.

1155
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:49,972
You don't know anything either?

1156
01:30:51,247 --> 01:30:52,805
No.

1157
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:55,776
No one knows.

1158
01:30:55,852 --> 01:31:01,256
He departed and left a note
about his replacement.

1159
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:08,627
For the question of assisted suicide,
Dr. Lang's statement may be crucial.

1160
01:31:09,298 --> 01:31:12,893
The witness's conduct
is incomprehensible.

1161
01:31:28,184 --> 01:31:32,644
Please come immediately.

1162
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:55,707
Where is she now?

1163
01:31:55,778 --> 01:31:58,042
Where?

1164
01:31:58,114 --> 01:32:00,241
In an institution.

1165
01:32:00,316 --> 01:32:05,845
She's blind.
She's deaf too and demented.

1166
01:32:05,922 --> 01:32:10,325
Wonderful, you healed her, Doctor...

1167
01:32:10,993 --> 01:32:13,393
instead of letting
that poor creature die.

1168
01:32:18,267 --> 01:32:20,258
Who am I?

1169
01:32:22,271 --> 01:32:25,263
Am I to decide life and death?

1170
01:32:25,341 --> 01:32:27,366
The poor child.

1171
01:32:27,443 --> 01:32:31,038
Doctor, you should have seen her.

1172
01:32:33,049 --> 01:32:34,846
My child.

1173
01:32:36,786 --> 01:32:42,190
We always thought
you'd come and help her.

1174
01:32:42,858 --> 01:32:44,348
I'll see her tomorrow.

1175
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:52,300
In contrast to my previous view,
and in agreement with my colleague...

1176
01:32:53,302 --> 01:32:57,796
I conclude that there is
insufficient proof to determine...

1177
01:32:57,873 --> 01:33:00,706
whether the deceased died...

1178
01:33:00,776 --> 01:33:03,472
from the lethal dosage...

1179
01:33:03,546 --> 01:33:07,539
or from the paralysis
of her respiratory system.

1180
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:12,410
The sclerosis of the respiratory system...

1181
01:33:12,488 --> 01:33:15,719
had already progressed so far...

1182
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:18,817
that this may have caused...

1183
01:33:18,894 --> 01:33:23,490
a fatal paralysis
of the respiratory system.

1184
01:33:23,566 --> 01:33:26,467
But thas crucial.

1185
01:33:26,535 --> 01:33:31,029
In a recent case at my clinic,
the sclerosis had not progressed this far.

1186
01:33:31,107 --> 01:33:33,598
As a medical officer,
it is your statement...

1187
01:33:33,676 --> 01:33:39,615
that the death may have been caused
by the disease itself?

1188
01:33:39,682 --> 01:33:45,245
- Yes. I have to affirm that.
- My view as well.

1189
01:33:47,923 --> 01:33:53,452
The accused, then, will be charged
with attempted murder instead...

1190
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:58,594
under section 211
of the criminal code.

1191
01:33:58,668 --> 01:34:02,229
He may adjust his defense accordingly.

1192
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:04,529
Three years in jail, at least.

1193
01:34:06,942 --> 01:34:12,608
- Ill be another moment.
- Please excuse my hurry...

1194
01:34:12,682 --> 01:34:15,674
but a lot depends on it for me.

1195
01:34:15,751 --> 01:34:18,743
When did you last see the girl?

1196
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:21,381
Several months ago.
I was on a long trip.

1197
01:34:21,457 --> 01:34:24,119
She has changed considerably.

1198
01:34:24,193 --> 01:34:25,854
But I have to see her.

1199
01:34:26,529 --> 01:34:31,694
It was a very difficult case.
An only child, and a young mother.

1200
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:35,760
I did everything to save
the chilïs life.

1201
01:34:35,838 --> 01:34:39,001
The mother gave blood
for two transfusions.

1202
01:34:39,075 --> 01:34:44,843
When the child was near the end,
I forced the heart with injections.

1203
01:34:48,351 --> 01:34:51,320
Now, the same mother tells me...

1204
01:34:52,121 --> 01:34:55,454
she hoped I'd come one more time...

1205
01:34:55,524 --> 01:34:57,651
to help her child.

1206
01:34:59,128 --> 01:35:01,722
You know what she meant by "help."

1207
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:08,163
I'm about ready
to leave our profession.

1208
01:35:08,237 --> 01:35:11,229
Because of that?

1209
01:35:11,307 --> 01:35:16,643
Not only that.
I also had another case at the time.

1210
01:35:16,712 --> 01:35:19,545
- You know I treated Hanna Heyt?
- Of course.

1211
01:35:20,516 --> 01:35:23,007
- We're ready, Professor.
- Come.

1212
01:35:23,686 --> 01:35:27,122
Dr. Lang was the girl's doctor.

1213
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:29,020
He wants to see her.

1214
01:35:29,091 --> 01:35:30,752
- Come.
- Thank you.

1215
01:35:35,364 --> 01:35:38,731
CHI LDREN'S WARD

1216
01:36:05,961 --> 01:36:07,451
Tell me.

1217
01:36:08,864 --> 01:36:10,525
How can the nurse take that?

1218
01:36:10,599 --> 01:36:12,464
The nurse?

1219
01:36:12,535 --> 01:36:16,437
She's a woman and loves
anything thas helpless.

1220
01:36:16,505 --> 01:36:19,838
A baby or a sick person,
it makes no difference.

1221
01:36:23,245 --> 01:36:27,181
- Can I use your phone?
- Yes.

1222
01:36:28,384 --> 01:36:34,721
Professor, do you think it possible
that the patient asked to die?

1223
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:39,784
- Yes. Absolutely.
- What facts do you base this on?

1224
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:43,629
The life of my colleague's wife...

1225
01:36:43,699 --> 01:36:49,194
had become an unbearable torture,
both physically and spiritually.

1226
01:36:49,271 --> 01:36:51,205
I witnessed it myself.

1227
01:36:51,273 --> 01:36:54,572
Add to that the worries about...

1228
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:59,637
her beloved husband who she saw
suffer for her and her sickness.

1229
01:36:59,715 --> 01:37:05,119
She was unable to release herself
from pain because of her paralysis.

1230
01:37:05,187 --> 01:37:07,985
Otherwise, she surely
would have done it herself.

1231
01:37:08,057 --> 01:37:12,756
She was an especially strong-willed,
lively and smart woman.

1232
01:37:12,828 --> 01:37:18,494
She would have done it
out of her deep love of her husband.

1233
01:37:20,369 --> 01:37:27,707
- What about the accused?
- His motive is found in his love for his wife.

1234
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:33,746
He sacrificed his greatest love
to help his great beloved.

1235
01:37:33,816 --> 01:37:36,080
Thas what it was.

1236
01:37:36,151 --> 01:37:39,348
As a doctor, he may have
gone outside the law.

1237
01:37:39,421 --> 01:37:42,584
With your leave, I'm only
sharing my personal views.

1238
01:37:42,658 --> 01:37:46,526
Any legal system
that requires a terminal patient...

1239
01:37:46,595 --> 01:37:49,758
to endure pointless suffering...

1240
01:37:49,832 --> 01:37:53,768
without the benefit of relief...

1241
01:37:53,836 --> 01:37:57,932
is unnatural and inhumane.

1242
01:37:58,007 --> 01:38:03,445
Nature lets things die quickly
when life is no longer viable.

1243
01:38:03,512 --> 01:38:07,448
Medical science
with its pills and drugs...

1244
01:38:07,516 --> 01:38:13,455
insists on artificially delaying
the mercy of a quick natural death.

1245
01:38:14,123 --> 01:38:18,423
Even when a cure or improvement
is completely impossible.

1246
01:38:18,494 --> 01:38:23,693
Thas a reversal of what
it really means to be doctor.

1247
01:38:23,766 --> 01:38:27,668
Every doctor is conflicted by that.

1248
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:30,031
Thas how it is.

1249
01:38:30,105 --> 01:38:35,099
Do you think the accused
acted out of a similar conviction?

1250
01:38:35,177 --> 01:38:42,345
The great German doctor Paracelsus
once said, "Medicine is love."

1251
01:38:42,418 --> 01:38:48,653
I know Professor Heyt
acted out of love alone.

1252
01:38:49,959 --> 01:38:52,393
Any further questions
from the prosecutor?

1253
01:38:53,395 --> 01:38:55,192
Defense counsel?

1254
01:38:56,899 --> 01:38:59,299
Thank you. Please take a seat.

1255
01:39:02,805 --> 01:39:06,832
Defense counsel, do you want
to cross-examine Pastor Görner?

1256
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:12,903
The hearing of evidence is thus concluded.
I now give the prosecutor the floor.

1257
01:39:17,519 --> 01:39:18,986
Gentlemen...

1258
01:39:20,022 --> 01:39:26,257
seeking justice is a difficult
and sometimes almost impossible task.

1259
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:31,862
If I have the duty to demand
the conviction of a man today...

1260
01:39:31,934 --> 01:39:36,428
whose scientific and individual
integrity is untouchable...

1261
01:39:36,505 --> 01:39:41,442
I'd like to express my thoughts
by quoting Richard Wagner...

1262
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:44,377
"My weapons weigh on me heavily."

1263
01:39:45,347 --> 01:39:48,680
My weapons are the existing laws.

1264
01:39:49,351 --> 01:39:54,015
Based on the trial,
they require a conviction for an act...

1265
01:39:54,089 --> 01:39:58,150
that can be excused on moral grounds.

1266
01:39:59,061 --> 01:40:05,227
But Professor Heys actions can
in no way be accepted on legal grounds.

1267
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,961
Especially not because...

1268
01:40:07,036 --> 01:40:09,698
as Professor Schlüter explained...

1269
01:40:09,772 --> 01:40:15,108
the act is apt to turn the accused
into a role model for doctors...

1270
01:40:15,177 --> 01:40:20,638
who then run the risk of violating laws
and their ethical standards.

1271
01:40:21,784 --> 01:40:25,413
Legally, the following must be said.

1272
01:40:26,422 --> 01:40:31,485
We cannot apply section 216
of the criminal code.

1273
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:36,224
As this requires an express
request from the deceased.

1274
01:40:36,298 --> 01:40:38,766
May I interrupt.

1275
01:40:38,834 --> 01:40:43,601
Dr. Lang is on his way here to testify.

1276
01:40:43,672 --> 01:40:47,768
We will adjourn for half an hour.

1277
01:40:48,577 --> 01:40:50,067
Adjourned for half an hour.

1278
01:40:54,349 --> 01:40:57,011
Thank God he made up his mind.

1279
01:40:57,086 --> 01:41:00,578
- What does this mean, Doctor?
- I don't know.

1280
01:41:00,656 --> 01:41:02,317
Anything is possible.

1281
01:41:05,094 --> 01:41:08,325
What if Dr. Lang testifies
that Mrs. Heyt wanted to die?

1282
01:41:08,397 --> 01:41:09,887
That wouldn't be enough.

1283
01:41:09,965 --> 01:41:13,457
There must be proof that she stated
an express wish to die.

1284
01:41:13,535 --> 01:41:18,632
- And then?
- It would be mercy killing, not murder.

1285
01:41:18,707 --> 01:41:20,641
Would he be convicted?

1286
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:26,841
The expert witness just said that
the exact cause cannot be determined.

1287
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:31,409
Was it her nerve condition,
or did he murder her?

1288
01:41:31,487 --> 01:41:34,422
If Dr. Lang confirms it,
we can go for an acquittal.

1289
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:38,358
- There you go.
- Unless he's guilty of assault.

1290
01:41:38,427 --> 01:41:40,987
- What?
- That would be a shame.

1291
01:41:41,063 --> 01:41:44,760
I feel sorry for him too,
but he had no right to do that.

1292
01:41:44,833 --> 01:41:50,203
But it was a good deed,
minimizing the poor woman's pain.

1293
01:41:50,272 --> 01:41:52,570
- You would acquit?
- Absolutely.

1294
01:41:52,641 --> 01:41:55,075
I'm not so sure.
This case has created a lot of noise.

1295
01:41:55,144 --> 01:41:57,612
Some doctors may want
to follow his example.

1296
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,080
That would be a grave sin.

1297
01:42:02,718 --> 01:42:04,549
If you asked me, gentlemen...

1298
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:06,781
Professor Heyt
should be acquitted precisely...

1299
01:42:06,855 --> 01:42:08,846
because he is a role model
for all doctors.

1300
01:42:08,924 --> 01:42:12,758
What if doctors
started relieving suffering?

1301
01:42:12,828 --> 01:42:15,092
Wouldn't people say no?

1302
01:42:15,164 --> 01:42:19,624
Prefer even terrible pain to dying?

1303
01:42:19,701 --> 01:42:22,329
- People would condemn doctors.
- Come on.

1304
01:42:22,404 --> 01:42:26,101
Everyone knows what doctors do
and continue to do for us.

1305
01:42:26,175 --> 01:42:30,669
They discovered X-rays and radiation,
and became cripples doing it.

1306
01:42:30,746 --> 01:42:34,773
If someone is terminally ill and would
rather die, why should he keep living?

1307
01:42:36,819 --> 01:42:39,287
If someone asks to die...

1308
01:42:39,354 --> 01:42:42,517
as the last help who can spare him...

1309
01:42:42,591 --> 01:42:44,923
doctors should be allowed to help.

1310
01:42:46,028 --> 01:42:48,394
That is all fine and good.

1311
01:42:48,463 --> 01:42:50,431
I agree.

1312
01:42:50,499 --> 01:42:56,836
But can these decisions
on life and death be left to doctors?

1313
01:42:56,905 --> 01:43:01,239
Of course not.
They'd take on the responsibility for it.

1314
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:03,244
Commissions must be appointed...

1315
01:43:03,312 --> 01:43:05,803
proper tribunals made up of doctors.

1316
01:43:05,881 --> 01:43:08,349
But something must be done.

1317
01:43:08,417 --> 01:43:10,078
It cannot go on like this.

1318
01:43:11,587 --> 01:43:13,817
It is Goïs will.

1319
01:43:13,889 --> 01:43:15,550
He sends suffering...

1320
01:43:15,624 --> 01:43:18,286
so that men will follow his cross...

1321
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,624
and attain eternal bliss.

1322
01:43:20,696 --> 01:43:22,186
My dear sir...

1323
01:43:22,264 --> 01:43:25,756
I would like to believe
that God is not that cruel...

1324
01:43:25,834 --> 01:43:27,597
nor the pastor, by the way.

1325
01:43:27,669 --> 01:43:30,832
Yes, well, gentlemen...

1326
01:43:30,906 --> 01:43:33,898
just a few weeks ago
I had to give my old hound...

1327
01:43:33,976 --> 01:43:35,910
the mercy shot.

1328
01:43:35,978 --> 01:43:38,469
He was blind and lame.

1329
01:43:38,547 --> 01:43:41,482
But otherwise, he had faithfully
served me his entire life.

1330
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:47,315
And if a hunter doesn't do that,
then he's a harsh fellow...

1331
01:43:47,389 --> 01:43:49,050
not an honorable huntsman.

1332
01:43:49,124 --> 01:43:51,456
Yes, but those are animals.

1333
01:43:51,526 --> 01:43:55,690
Yes, but are people to be treated
worse than animals?

1334
01:43:55,764 --> 01:44:00,167
Is not that simple.

1335
01:44:00,235 --> 01:44:07,334
The right to kill shouldn't
be given to a doctor alone...

1336
01:44:07,409 --> 01:44:15,409
these final medical decisions
should be left to the state.

1337
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:23,248
We would have to pass laws
for such "medical courts".

1338
01:44:23,325 --> 01:44:25,156
But as soon as possible.

1339
01:44:26,094 --> 01:44:28,028
I'm an old soldier, gentlemen.

1340
01:44:28,096 --> 01:44:33,966
Is evident to me that our state
demands a duty to die if need be.

1341
01:44:34,036 --> 01:44:38,473
But then it should also have to give us
the right to die, if necessary.

1342
01:44:39,308 --> 01:44:44,302
Sure, Major, but the laws
applicable here are still different.

1343
01:44:44,379 --> 01:44:48,873
Of course we will judge
Professor Heyt under current law.

1344
01:44:48,951 --> 01:44:52,978
That goes without saying.
But allow me to say...

1345
01:44:53,055 --> 01:44:59,392
the law is not here
to prevent people from worthy moral acts.

1346
01:44:59,461 --> 01:45:03,124
If thas the case,
the law must be changed.

1347
01:45:04,499 --> 01:45:09,061
- Witness Dr. Lang is here.
- Finally. Come, gentlemen.

1348
01:45:12,107 --> 01:45:18,046
That was quite an interesting
debate on criminal law.

1349
01:45:18,113 --> 01:45:21,048
We rarely have such
interesting lay jurors.

1350
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:23,984
I wonder what Dr. Lang will say?

1351
01:45:24,052 --> 01:45:27,681
I hope he won't make things worse.

1352
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:34,857
We're hearing evidence again.
Call the witness Dr. Lang.

1353
01:45:37,632 --> 01:45:39,122
Witness Dr. Lang.

1354
01:45:54,883 --> 01:45:57,977
I originally didn't plan
to appear, Your Honor.

1355
01:45:58,053 --> 01:46:00,954
- You'll be held in contempt.
- By all means.

1356
01:46:02,491 --> 01:46:04,516
- You are Dr. Bernhard Lang?
- Yes.

1357
01:46:04,593 --> 01:46:06,424
- Age?
- 42.

1358
01:46:06,495 --> 01:46:08,429
- Family physician?
- Yes.

1359
01:46:09,331 --> 01:46:12,459
- Are you related to the accused?
- No.

1360
01:46:12,534 --> 01:46:14,297
You're aware of the meaning
of your oath?

1361
01:46:14,369 --> 01:46:15,393
Yes.

1362
01:46:16,805 --> 01:46:19,205
You have known Professor Heyt
for a long time?

1363
01:46:20,142 --> 01:46:22,610
- Since we were children.
- You are friends?

1364
01:46:23,745 --> 01:46:25,975
We were.

1365
01:46:26,048 --> 01:46:29,540
You introduced him
to his future wife, right?

1366
01:46:30,986 --> 01:46:33,250
Yes, for the second time.

1367
01:46:33,989 --> 01:46:36,924
After the Stretter family
moved north...

1368
01:46:36,992 --> 01:46:40,553
Thomas and I completed
our studies in Innsbruck.

1369
01:46:40,629 --> 01:46:43,564
I opened my practice here.

1370
01:46:43,632 --> 01:46:48,695
Was your relationship with the
Stretters instrumental in this?

1371
01:46:50,739 --> 01:46:51,739
Yes.

1372
01:46:53,542 --> 01:46:56,739
- You later supported Dr. Heyt.
- Yes.

1373
01:46:57,913 --> 01:47:02,577
- You treated the deceased?
- Yes.

1374
01:47:02,651 --> 01:47:05,313
How did she assess her condition?

1375
01:47:05,387 --> 01:47:09,289
She was very patient,
sometimes even euphoric...

1376
01:47:09,357 --> 01:47:14,522
and optimistic, she really loved life.

1377
01:47:14,596 --> 01:47:18,999
Did that change
as a result of her disease?

1378
01:47:19,835 --> 01:47:21,769
Yes, most certainly.

1379
01:47:21,837 --> 01:47:23,600
She was afraid sometimes-

1380
01:47:25,907 --> 01:47:27,966
Was she afraid of death?

1381
01:47:29,311 --> 01:47:31,973
No, not of death.

1382
01:47:32,047 --> 01:47:34,515
Rather, of dying.

1383
01:47:35,984 --> 01:47:41,889
Were these merely moods,
or could they be called something else?

1384
01:47:41,957 --> 01:47:46,951
Was Mrs. Heyt aware of these moods?

1385
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:49,688
Yes.

1386
01:47:49,764 --> 01:47:52,699
She asked me once...

1387
01:47:54,202 --> 01:47:56,170
if she took a turn for the worse...

1388
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:02,601
and if her life
would no longer be humane...

1389
01:48:02,677 --> 01:48:07,478
that I help her die.

1390
01:48:10,385 --> 01:48:11,875
And you?

1391
01:48:14,156 --> 01:48:20,925
At that time, I didn't see her request
as compatible with my oath.

1392
01:48:20,996 --> 01:48:22,930
May I ask a question?

1393
01:48:23,632 --> 01:48:27,159
- Dr. Lang, you said, "at that time."
- Yes. That was then.

1394
01:48:27,235 --> 01:48:31,899
- And today?
- This very day? Probably not.

1395
01:48:33,108 --> 01:48:39,047
Do you think the deceased
may have asked her husband too?

1396
01:48:39,114 --> 01:48:41,048
She did. I know so.

1397
01:48:42,717 --> 01:48:47,518
Dr. Lang, what do you believe
the cause of her death was?

1398
01:48:52,093 --> 01:48:54,152
May I say something?

1399
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:55,890
The expert witness said-

1400
01:48:55,964 --> 01:48:57,693
Counsel!

1401
01:48:58,967 --> 01:49:03,131
- Answer my question, please, Doctor.
- I don't understand the question.

1402
01:49:03,205 --> 01:49:04,729
Really?

1403
01:49:04,806 --> 01:49:07,468
I learned of Hanna Heys death
from her husband.

1404
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:10,807
I have not seen him
or the deceased since then.

1405
01:49:12,147 --> 01:49:15,344
The expert witness must have
determined cause of death, right?

1406
01:49:15,417 --> 01:49:20,787
He said that the sclerosis of the
respiratory system may have killed her...

1407
01:49:20,855 --> 01:49:26,259
before the toxic dose could take effect.

1408
01:49:27,329 --> 01:49:29,320
Do you think it possible?

1409
01:49:31,266 --> 01:49:33,894
You are under oath.

1410
01:49:35,737 --> 01:49:39,002
You said to me, Bernhard,
"You murdered her."

1411
01:49:39,074 --> 01:49:42,407
Yes, Thomas.
And today I say to you...

1412
01:49:43,245 --> 01:49:44,906
you're not a murderer.

1413
01:49:49,584 --> 01:49:51,779
Thank you, Bernhard.

1414
01:49:53,088 --> 01:49:56,649
Based on your knowledge
of Mrs. Heys condition...

1415
01:49:57,325 --> 01:49:58,758
is her death possible...

1416
01:49:58,827 --> 01:50:02,923
as a result of either cause stated?

1417
01:50:06,601 --> 01:50:09,934
An hour before her death,
he told me she had two more months.

1418
01:50:10,005 --> 01:50:14,499
Surely, this cannot
have changed since then.

1419
01:50:14,576 --> 01:50:17,409
You're jeopardizing your acquittal.

1420
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:22,678
I know. I cannot remain silent.
Is not just about me.

1421
01:50:22,751 --> 01:50:26,016
It concerns everyone.
I am not afraid.

1422
01:50:26,087 --> 01:50:28,487
He who would be followed
must be able to lead.

1423
01:50:28,556 --> 01:50:34,222
I no longer feel I stand accused for I
suffered the biggest loss by my actions.

1424
01:50:34,296 --> 01:50:35,957
No, I will accuse now.

1425
01:50:36,031 --> 01:50:38,522
I will accuse a section of the law...

1426
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:41,660
that prevents doctors and judges
from serving the public.

1427
01:50:41,736 --> 01:50:44,261
I don't want my case
to be swept under the rug.

1428
01:50:44,339 --> 01:50:45,829
I want a verdict.

1429
01:50:45,907 --> 01:50:50,571
No matter what,
it will serve as a signal, a change.

1430
01:50:51,546 --> 01:50:55,607
Therefore, I confess:
I ended the suffering...

1431
01:50:55,684 --> 01:50:58,847
of my terminally ill wife
at her own request.

1432
01:50:59,688 --> 01:51:02,657
My life now depends on your verdict.

1433
01:51:02,724 --> 01:51:06,854
And the lives of all who may come
to share my wife's fate.
