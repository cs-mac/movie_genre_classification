1
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,633
And these are actually for sale
in the bookshops?

2
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,080
And in the streets as well,
Father.

3
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,590
- And in Toledo?
- In Toledo. In Salamanca,

4
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,357
Sevilla.

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,915
And in the Port of Cádiz.

6
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:15,718
So these prints
are sent abroad?

7
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:17,959
These are sold in Rome.

8
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:20,312
Even as far as Mexico.

9
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:23,196
This is how the world sees us.

10
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:26,475
This,
this is how the world is seeing us.

11
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:29,435
What is the name of the artist?

12
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:31,202
Francisco Goya.

13
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:40,276
Isn't he the man you commissioned
to paint your portrait?

14
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,273
He is, Father.

15
00:02:44,483 --> 00:02:46,202
Why did you choose him?

16
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:48,282
In all humility, Father,

17
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:51,761
I chose him for the same reason
our King and the Queen

18
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:54,923
have appointed him
to be the Court painter.

19
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,641
They consider him the greatest
painter in Spain.

20
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:02,836
These prints are quite disturbing,
I must say.

21
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:06,325
Disturbing?

22
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:09,283
Yes, yes, of course they are.

23
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:12,797
But, Father, these prints

24
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,159
show us
the true face of our world.

25
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:19,961
Maybe your world,
Brother Lorenzo.

26
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,284
How can you call
these hideous images

27
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:25,245
"the true face of our world"?

28
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:29,045
There is but one world, Brother,

29
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:32,719
and it is neither yours, nor mine.
It is the Lord's.

30
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,365
Have you lost your sight,
Brother?

31
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:38,480
Do you not see what demonic filth
and degradation

32
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:40,640
this Goya is selling?

33
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,803
He's an agent
of the darkest powers!

34
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,809
Granted that he's decorated
chapels.

35
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,649
He's painted angels, yes,

36
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,523
but when your mother raises her
eyes to pray to God

37
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,959
whom do you think she sees?

38
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:59,562
Whom do you think Goya
is using as models

39
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:01,723
for his angels?

40
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:04,171
Harlots!

41
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:08,160
Those are whores smiling down
at your mother from the ceiling!

42
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:09,930
I assert

43
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,281
before all of you

44
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:16,246
that Goya is a valuable
member of the Church.

45
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,451
How so?

46
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,963
Father, I have met women

47
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:24,447
who cannot recite
a single prayer.

48
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:25,966
It's them...

49
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:28,770
We have to seek them out,

50
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:30,764
but what is our response?

51
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:34,852
Condemn this great
Spanish artist instead?

52
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:38,523
Or do you think,
by burning Goya's canvases

53
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:41,486
the evil this artist
has depicted

54
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:43,486
will go up in flames?

55
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,567
Why don't we look at ourselves?

56
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:47,292
What have we accomplished

57
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:49,530
in the last 50 years?

58
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:52,532
How many heretics
have we sent to the stake?

59
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:55,090
I will tell you exactly how many,
Father. Eight.

60
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,810
Eight burned at the stake.

61
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:01,130
Are you proposing we show

62
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:02,891
greater severity?

63
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:07,648
Yes, Father, yes.
We have to return to the old ways.

64
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:11,412
I'm talking about the God- fearing
ways of the past.

65
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:17,845
Are you prepared
to join this battle?

66
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,015
Never mind join,

67
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:23,686
grant me the wisdom to lead it,
Father.

68
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,938
Why doesn't that painting
have a face?

69
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,214
Because he's a ghost.

70
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,219
No, he is not!

71
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,893
Have you ever seen a ghost?

72
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:56,977
No.

73
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,254
But I have seen a witch.

74
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:02,650
- Oh, did you?
- Yes, but she had a face.

75
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:05,336
What did she look like?

76
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,453
She was all bent and creepy,

77
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,659
and she stank... Phew!

78
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,460
That's interesting.
Because the witch that I know

79
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:18,339
she's young, very lovely,

80
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,458
and she smells of jasmine.

81
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:22,414
- She does?
- She does.

82
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:25,979
And I'm working on her portrait
right now.

83
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,704
I'm no witch!

84
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:34,133
How do you know?

85
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:58,100
Am I allowed to say something?

86
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:02,024
- Please.
- I know that face.

87
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:04,615
She would not be
one of your angels

88
00:07:04,786 --> 00:07:06,935
in the Florida chapel, would she?

89
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:10,617
Yes, she is.
You're dangerously perceptive.

90
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:16,302
This is probably a very naive

91
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,537
but I am a man of the cloth.

92
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:21,025
Do you...?

93
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:27,617
Do you painters not become very
intimate with your models?

94
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:32,742
It must be very...

95
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,222
tempting...

96
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:37,386
when you spend hours
and hours alone with,

97
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:38,743
not only beautiful,

98
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,739
but young girl.

99
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,823
Would you like me to include
your hands in the portrait?

100
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,307
- I'll leave that up to you.
- No, it's up to you to decide.

101
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:54,546
Hands are not easy to paint

102
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:57,100
and not everybody will spend
the extra money.

103
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:58,704
Well, what is the difference?

104
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,701
One hand, two thousand reales.
Two hands, three thousand.

105
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,944
Why did you agree to paint
my portrait?

106
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:15,711
Why not?

107
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:20,231
You have the reputation of mocking
the men of cloth in your work.

108
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:22,423
And harshly, I must say.

109
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:24,626
Do I?

110
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,540
Are you aware of how many powerful
enemies you have, Goya?

111
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:33,390
Fortunately, I also have
a few very powerful friends.

112
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,590
How have you been, dear Goya?

113
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:55,515
- As always, Your Majesty
- So don't complain.

114
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:57,670
I endeavor not to, Your Majesty.

115
00:08:57,874 --> 00:09:00,069
Is this the wild steed

116
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,306
that I am to conquer today?

117
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,834
Oh, dear!

118
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:17,232
So how do you want me to ride?

119
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:21,346
How do you want history to perceive
you, madam?

120
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:23,833
The way I am,

121
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,114
young and beautiful.

122
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:17,072
Which one do you wish for supper,
my dear?

123
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:21,951
Maybe...

124
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,440
the vulture.

125
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:34,120
May I stay

126
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:37,076
and watch you work for a while?

127
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,558
Why, if I may have any say
in the matter, Your Majesty,

128
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:45,553
I'd prefer no- one see the work
before it's finished.

129
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:48,439
Am I intruding?

130
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:50,363
Yes,

131
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,000
you are, my dear.

132
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,843
Oh, I see.

133
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:02,443
As you wish,

134
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:05,160
as you will,

135
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:09,965
whatever is your pleasure.

136
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:41,402
How long do I have to sit up here?

137
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:47,678
For as long as I may need you there,
Your Majesty.

138
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,644
See what I am carrying?

139
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,960
I must be a pious man, right?

140
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,921
But look at what
is really inside this.

141
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:02,642
Voltaire!

142
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,248
Voltaire!

143
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,082
The Dark Prince
of the darkest principles!

144
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:12,525
Devious. Devious.

145
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:15,845
Be vigilant, use your ears.

146
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:17,047
People talk.

147
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:21,286
You might hear somebody
claiming that matter

148
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:25,280
consists of very small elements,
called atoms.

149
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:27,445
Get his name.

150
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,521
He's a heretic

151
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,807
spreading these diabolical ideas

152
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:35,689
to poison the souls
of God- fearing people.

153
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:40,730
If you hear somebody talking
about 'The Temple',

154
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:43,368
instead of 'The Church',

155
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:47,089
he is either a Judaiser,
or, even worse, a Protestant.

156
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,253
Get his name.

157
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:52,127
If you are in a public place
and see a man

158
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:56,124
hiding his penis with his hand
while urinating

159
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:59,649
the man is probably circumcised.

160
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:01,855
And he's a Judaiser!

161
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:05,811
I am giving you
just a few examples

162
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:09,406
of what to look for,
whom to identify.

163
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:12,130
Bring their names to the attention
of Holy Office.

164
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:15,690
Your eyes, your ears,
your brain.

165
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:18,890
They are the servants of God.

166
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,779
Come on, Inés.
Taste it, it's good.

167
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,733
Come on.

168
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:31,373
- Hey, where are you going?
- Oh, she's going to the dwarf.

169
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,582
What did you do?

170
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:43,103
- Inés, wipe your mouth.
- No.

171
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:08,735
You have received a summons
from the Holy Office.

172
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:13,384
Do you have any idea
what it might be about?

173
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:14,577
No.

174
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:17,500
Where did you go with your brothers
last night?

175
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,139
The Tavern.

176
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:20,496
Think!

177
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:23,216
Did you say something sacrilegious?

178
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:25,096
No.

179
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:29,660
Was there an incident
they could hold against her?

180
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,666
She kissed the feet of a dwarf.

181
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:34,540
- You did?
- She did.

182
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,786
- Everyone did!
- You know, they can summon her

183
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:40,504
just to testify
against someone else?

184
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,541
Someone else?

185
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,107
Is there someone you know
they might be interested in?

186
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,505
I don't know.

187
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:51,739
No!

188
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,267
Do not worry, my child.

189
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,071
My child.

190
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:37,627
In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

191
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,067
Amen.

192
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:44,796
Sit down, please.

193
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,674
Are you Inés Bilbatua,

194
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,956
begat by one
Tomás Pio Bilbatua

195
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,115
and his wife María Isabel?

196
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,470
- Yes, I am.
- We have only a few questions

197
00:17:57,681 --> 00:17:59,636
and we expect you
to answer truthfully.

198
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:01,554
I will.

199
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,590
Is it true that on Wednesday,
the 16th of this month

200
00:18:05,802 --> 00:18:08,634
you dined at the inn
of Dona Julia?

201
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,394
Yes, it is.

202
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,592
What were you served that evening?

203
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,115
- For dinner?
- Oh, yes.

204
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:24,879
You actually want to know
what we ate?

205
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:26,197
For dinner.

206
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,480
I had chicken.

207
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:43,671
Onions,

208
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:48,361
chickpeas.

209
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:52,638
Chickpeas.

210
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:54,642
And?

211
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,124
Potatoes.

212
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:59,163
Green peppers.

213
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,842
Were you served pork?

214
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,918
Yes, but I didn't have any.

215
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:12,314
- Why not?
- I don't like the taste.

216
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:16,004
Are you prepared to swear
on the Holy Cross

217
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,044
that you're telling the truth?

218
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:20,758
About the pork?

219
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,038
Are you?

220
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,923
I swear on Jesus's sacred wounds,
I'm telling you the truth.

221
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:29,595
And I suppose
that you would not object

222
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:32,276
if we gave you an opportunity
to prove it?

223
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:34,843
No, I would be grateful.

224
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:39,284
How would you like me to prove it?

225
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,568
Did you tell us the truth?

226
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,285
Yes! Yes, I did!

227
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,960
We have reason
to suspect otherwise.

228
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,400
Why?

229
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:11,606
We suspect the reason you avoid pork
is because you are secret Judaiser.

230
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,290
What?

231
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:16,005
- Are you?
- What is that?

232
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:18,569
You practice Jewish rituals.

233
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:20,964
No, I do not!

234
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:24,408
You have something to confess.
Do it now.

235
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,806
But I...
What do you want me to confess?

236
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:30,682
The truth.

237
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:33,411
But I did!

238
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:39,726
Tell me what the truth is!

239
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,088
Tell me what the truth is!

240
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:11,687
Hey, Tomás, how wonderful
to see you, my friend.

241
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,047
- How are you, Francisco?
- Come in, come in.

242
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:21,607
- Can I offer you anything?
- No, nothing, thank you.

243
00:21:22,777 --> 00:21:24,655
Are we alone?

244
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:26,525
Yes.

245
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,967
I need to speak with this man,
Francisco.

246
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:34,777
Why?

247
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:39,247
My daughter Inés has been summoned
by the Holy Office.

248
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:43,290
- Inés?
- Yes.

249
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,768
That's preposterous.

250
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,928
She went in this morning
and she hasn't come out yet.

251
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:52,654
And we haven't heard
a word, either.

252
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,737
Do you know why they
wanted to talk to her?

253
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,572
No. That's why I would like
to speak with this man.

254
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,251
Francisco, I'm very sorry
to have to ask you this,

255
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,172
but is there any way
you can arrange it?

256
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:19,056
But I'm in no position to curry
favors from the Inquisition...

257
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:22,652
No, no favors.
I'm simply trying to learn

258
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:26,411
if there is anything at all
I can do to help my daughter.

259
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:29,540
I wish I...

260
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:37,097
No! I cannot talk
to the Holy Office

261
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:39,334
about any matter

262
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:41,898
that does not pertain directly
to me.

263
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:42,702
I'm sorry.

264
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:45,533
I beg you, Francisco.

265
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:21,148
Father Lorenzo.

266
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:22,915
Come in.

267
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,956
This way.

268
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,313
If I were to meet this man
on the street,

269
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:50,549
I would never recognize myself
in him.

270
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:56,872
One has such a different idea
of oneself.

271
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,677
You think you might like him?

272
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,752
I know I like the painting of him.

273
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,590
Yes, yes...

274
00:26:09,842 --> 00:26:11,433
I'm very pleased
with it, Francisco.

275
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:15,710
- Shall I choose a frame for it?
- Yes, please, do.

276
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:18,799
- And there's no need to send money.
- What do you mean?

277
00:26:19,802 --> 00:26:22,954
- Somebody's paying for it.
- Who's paying for it?

278
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:26,237
His name is Tomás Bilbatua.

279
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:30,434
He's a very rich merchant.

280
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:32,361
He also intends to underwrite

281
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:35,720
the reconstruction of the Convent
of Saint Tomás.

282
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:39,716
He's also asked me to paint
frescos throughout the Convent,

283
00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:43,394
which is a very welcome
commission, I must admit.

284
00:26:43,724 --> 00:26:46,875
- What is his name?
- Bilbatua.

285
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:50,595
What does Senor Bilbatua want
from me?

286
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:55,963
He's the father of...

287
00:26:56,207 --> 00:27:00,198
You recall seeing her face on the
ceiling in the Florida chapel?

288
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:02,153
Yes?

289
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:06,434
She's been arrested
by the Holy Office.

290
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:12,917
I know him quite well.
He's a very honorable man.

291
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:46,646
Don't be afraid.

292
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:50,007
- Inés Bilbatua?
- Yes.

293
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:00,529
I am hereto see if I can...

294
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:04,812
possibly be of some assistance.

295
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:07,211
May I go home now?

296
00:29:07,536 --> 00:29:10,130
I don't have the power
to decide that, Inés.

297
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,493
I wanna go home.

298
00:29:17,418 --> 00:29:19,328
Do not fear, my child.

299
00:29:25,217 --> 00:29:27,971
I can deliver a message
to your family...

300
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:29,970
Do you want me to?

301
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:31,935
Please.

302
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:35,251
Will you tell them
that I love them?

303
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:39,253
I love them so much.

304
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,728
And please,

305
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:44,574
tell them that always,

306
00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:47,410
when I shut my eyes

307
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,217
and I pray to God

308
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:52,819
I beseech Him
to let me see my mother

309
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,336
and my father

310
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,495
and my brothers,

311
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,769
when I open my eyes...

312
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:06,049
- Do you want me to pray with you?
- Yes, please.

313
00:30:17,063 --> 00:30:18,781
Glory to God on high.

314
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:22,057
And on earth peace
to men of good will.

315
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:26,051
We praise You, we bless You,
we adore You, we glorify You.

316
00:30:26,262 --> 00:30:29,174
We give You thanks
for Your great Glory.

317
00:30:29,382 --> 00:30:33,172
O Lord God, heavenly King,
God the Father Almighty.

318
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:36,218
O Lord Jesus Christ,
the only- begotten Son.

319
00:30:37,224 --> 00:30:40,181
O Lord Jesus Christ, Lord God,
Lamb of God...

320
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:42,818
Very good, Inés.

321
00:30:43,023 --> 00:30:45,220
I'll take care of you.

322
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,017
It's all right, it's all right.

323
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:58,418
- Hello! Welcome.
- Tomás!

324
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,183
- Gracias, Padre.
- Thank you, Jose.

325
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:03,105
- How are you, Francisco?
- I'm very well, thank you.

326
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,785
Father Lorenzo.

327
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:09,493
It's a great honor for me to welcome
you in my house, Father Lorenzo.

328
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,500
This way, please.
These are my sons.

329
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:15,141
Ángel... and Álvaro.

330
00:31:15,348 --> 00:31:16,905
Hello, Ángel.

331
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,783
And this is my dear wife...

332
00:31:21,186 --> 00:31:23,063
María Isabel.

333
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:26,625
Father Lorenzo,

334
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:28,786
welcome to our house.

335
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,184
- Thank you.
- Please.

336
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:34,102
Francisco, thank you.

337
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:37,265
The time has come for me
to repay

338
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,339
the Lord
for all his kindness

339
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:42,700
by restoring the Convent
of Saint Tomás.

340
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:46,309
You know,
Tomás being my own name,

341
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:57,903
I'm very sorry that my daughter
cannot dine with us tonight.

342
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:02,028
A most...

343
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,821
a most marvelous work indeed,
Goya.

344
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:07,589
Thank you.

345
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:09,346
As I was saying,

346
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:13,067
the time has come for me to repay
the Lord for all His kindness

347
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:16,309
by restoring the Convent
of Saint Tomás.

348
00:32:20,991 --> 00:32:23,382
Bless us, o Lord,

349
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,827
and your gifts,

350
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:29,423
which from your bounty we are about
to receive through Christ our Lord.

351
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:30,861
Amen.

352
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:38,752
To the successful restoration
of the Convent of Saint Tomás.

353
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:46,233
This wine is excellent.

354
00:32:46,436 --> 00:32:49,630
It was aged on a ship that has gone
twice around the world.

355
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:52,750
It takes constant motion

356
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:54,905
to bring out the flavor
in this particular wine.

357
00:32:55,313 --> 00:32:57,067
I didn't know that.

358
00:32:57,274 --> 00:32:59,950
And these are anchovies
from Santoña.

359
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:04,835
I presume that you're anxious
to have some news of your daughter.

360
00:33:05,195 --> 00:33:06,343
Oh, yes,

361
00:33:06,915 --> 00:33:08,313
extremely so.

362
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:11,827
She has never ever been away.
Did you see her?

363
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,755
Yes, I did.

364
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:15,834
How is she?

365
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:18,790
She's in fine spirits

366
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,187
and sends her love
to all of you.

367
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:24,867
When can we expect her home?

368
00:33:25,557 --> 00:33:29,187
I couldn't say.
She must first stand trial.

369
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:30,625
Stand trial?

370
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,269
Why?

371
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:36,393
For what she has confessed.

372
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:39,234
What did she confess?

373
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,268
That she had secretly practiced

374
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,350
the Jewish rituals
of her forbears.

375
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,915
But that's impossible.

376
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:51,435
We are an old Christian family.

377
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,394
Correct me if I'm wrong

378
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:57,559
but the Brothers in charge
of the archives...

379
00:33:57,761 --> 00:34:00,558
informed me that your
grandmother's great- grandfather

380
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,871
converted from Judaism to
Christianity when he came to Spain

381
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,877
from Amsterdam in 1624.

382
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:11,199
Is that true?

383
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,592
Yes.

384
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:18,592
But I am the only person
in the family who knows that.

385
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:21,756
Then why has your daughter
confessed to it?

386
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,238
Inés couldn't possibly confess to
something she has no knowledge of.

387
00:34:26,442 --> 00:34:27,717
Excuse me,

388
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:30,602
was my sister put
to 'The Question'?

389
00:34:31,004 --> 00:34:32,562
Yes, she was.

390
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:35,600
My daughter was tortured?

391
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,880
She was put to 'The Question'.

392
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:41,154
I thought that kind
of 'investigation'

393
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:43,281
had been abandoned years ago.

394
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:46,079
Yes, it was,

395
00:34:47,244 --> 00:34:50,078
but now
in these troubled times,

396
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:53,721
in its quest for the truth,
the Church is bringing it back.

397
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,153
So...

398
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:59,314
you maintain that a confession
obtained by the means of

399
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:03,313
as you call it 'The Question'
is valid proof of anything?

400
00:35:04,484 --> 00:35:07,957
This is not an opinion
of one simple monk, sir.

401
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:10,920
It is a tenet of Church
teaching that a confession

402
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:14,800
attained by 'The Question'
constitutes ultimate proof.

403
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:18,316
I'm sorry, Lorenzo,

404
00:35:18,526 --> 00:35:21,518
but how can this sort
of confession be an ultimate proof?

405
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:24,958
If I were tortured, I'd confess
to anything.

406
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:28,160
I'd confess
I was the Turkish sultan.

407
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:29,882
No, you wouldn't.

408
00:35:30,048 --> 00:35:32,197
I would confess to anything
to avoid pain.

409
00:35:32,407 --> 00:35:34,557
No, you wouldn't.

410
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:37,283
You're a God- fearing man, Goya,
aren't you?

411
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,766
Of course I am.

412
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,200
So, your fear of God would prevent
you from making a false confession.

413
00:35:45,008 --> 00:35:47,569
But what ifthe pain obscured
my senses?

414
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:51,162
What if my fear of pain
became bigger

415
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,162
than my fear of God?

416
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,760
If you are innocent of the charge,
God will give you the strength

417
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,847
to withstand the pain.

418
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,405
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

419
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,721
Forgive me, Father Lorenzo,

420
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,719
but have you ever been
put to the...

421
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:10,446
to 'The Question' yourself?

422
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:14,240
- Have I ever been?
- Yes.

423
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,922
Have you ever been subjected
to 'The Question'?

424
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:19,644
Of course not.

425
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:22,367
Do you think that if you were

426
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:24,767
and they asked you to confess

427
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,001
something grotesquely absurd,

428
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:28,962
say...

429
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:33,165
say you were told to confess that
you are really a monke...

430
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:38,366
are you sure that God

431
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:40,924
would grant you the fortitude
to deny it?

432
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:43,693
Or would you rather confess
to being a monkey

433
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:45,491
to avoid the pain?

434
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:47,206
I know I would.

435
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:51,203
I know you would.
So would I.

436
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:54,886
Would you?

437
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:02,164
What is this? Are you playing some
sort of silly game with your guest?

438
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:06,051
Nobody would ever ask Father Lorenzo
to confess something so absurd.

439
00:37:06,736 --> 00:37:08,613
I would.

440
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:28,288
- Is he serious?
- Oh, I'm sure he's not.

441
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:32,050
Álvaro, go get your father.

442
00:37:35,578 --> 00:37:37,889
Sometimes I don't understand
his humor.

443
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:40,808
Nobody does.

444
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:43,373
Because my father doesn't have
a sense of humor.

445
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:46,576
Oh, yes, he does.

446
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:50,774
- More wine?
- No, thank you.

447
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,327
Francisco?

448
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:03,295
"I, Lorenzo Casamares,

449
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:07,689
hereby confess that, contrary
to my human appearance,

450
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:09,621
am, in fact,

451
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:12,692
the bastard son of a chimpanzee
and an orangutan

452
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,811
and I have schemed
to join the Church in order

453
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:20,059
to do harm to the Holy Office."

454
00:38:35,342 --> 00:38:37,016
Sign it.

455
00:38:40,743 --> 00:38:43,497
This is a joke, Tomás, right?

456
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:47,142
Sign it.

457
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:56,180
Ángel, block the door.

458
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:03,700
Francisco, escort me out
of this house.

459
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,659
Stop Senor Goya.

460
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:12,294
- Are you crazy?
- Francisco, please stay out of this.

461
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:14,735
- Let us go.
- You can go.

462
00:39:14,945 --> 00:39:17,983
What do you mean I can go?
And Father Lorenzo?

463
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:20,781
Did he let my daughter go?

464
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:25,261
Did you let my innocent daughter
go?

465
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:28,905
Did he?

466
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,301
Keep him here.
Let Senor Goya go.

467
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,386
Release him!

468
00:39:37,828 --> 00:39:39,181
Escort Señor Goya out.

469
00:39:40,348 --> 00:39:41,906
Tomás!

470
00:39:42,468 --> 00:39:45,939
Take your hands off me!
This is outrageous.

471
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:48,186
Are you ready to sign
the confession?

472
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,027
María Isabel.

473
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:24,308
Bring him here.

474
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:29,232
Sign it.

475
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:40,502
Tie his hands.

476
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:47,023
Will you sign?

477
00:40:53,315 --> 00:40:54,667
All right.

478
00:40:54,874 --> 00:40:56,912
Let's find out if God will give
you the strength

479
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:58,988
to resist 'The Question'.

480
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:01,113
Lift him up.

481
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,316
I will burn this paper

482
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,477
the moment
my daughter returns home.

483
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,876
But I won't wait forever.

484
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,996
You must understand that.

485
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,715
All right, you are free to go now.

486
00:42:16,441 --> 00:42:17,954
Father Lorenzo?

487
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,721
You're forgetting something.

488
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:26,714
This might be of great help
to both of us.

489
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:42,719
This is a very generous
contribution, indeed.

490
00:42:44,404 --> 00:42:47,760
We are grateful for your efforts,

491
00:42:47,925 --> 00:42:49,562
Brother Lorenzo.

492
00:42:51,043 --> 00:42:53,239
There is a request, Father.

493
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:56,195
There usually is.

494
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:59,557
Let us hear the particulars.

495
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:01,564
The merchant

496
00:43:02,284 --> 00:43:04,196
would like
to have his daughter back.

497
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:07,996
- Is she with us?
- Yes, Father. Yes.

498
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,125
- What is her status?
- A Judaiser.

499
00:43:14,686 --> 00:43:17,521
How did you respond
to this request?

500
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:20,960
I promised
to plead for her release.

501
00:43:22,407 --> 00:43:26,195
- On what grounds?
- I took into consideration...

502
00:43:28,248 --> 00:43:31,082
the size of the endowment as well
as the fact

503
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:33,437
that she is very young.

504
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,678
Did she confess?

505
00:43:36,888 --> 00:43:38,445
Yes, Father.

506
00:43:38,888 --> 00:43:41,563
She was put to 'The Question'.

507
00:43:44,448 --> 00:43:47,600
We shall accept
this magnanimous gift

508
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:49,958
with humble gratitude.

509
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,082
We shall also carve the name
of the donor

510
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:58,761
in the Convent in stone
to commemorate

511
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:01,165
his generosity forever.

512
00:44:02,928 --> 00:44:05,126
As for the daughter,

513
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,479
I will pray to the Lord He may
bestow His mercy on her.

514
00:44:10,451 --> 00:44:13,010
Of course, releasing her would
contradict

515
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,412
the basic principles
of our faith,

516
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,921
because it would suggest
that the Church

517
00:44:19,132 --> 00:44:21,361
doubts the power
of 'The Question'.

518
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:25,683
We are concluded.

519
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,006
- Did you see my parents?
Yes, I did, I did.

520
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:43,043
They are doing everything
they can to get you out.

521
00:44:43,254 --> 00:44:44,243
And?

522
00:44:47,213 --> 00:44:48,441
And...

523
00:44:49,694 --> 00:44:52,529
they love you very much, Inés.

524
00:44:55,896 --> 00:44:57,851
Shall we pray together, Inés?

525
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:29,452
I can't believe it.

526
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,050
"I am, in fact,
the bastard son

527
00:45:33,258 --> 00:45:36,295
of a chimpanzee
and an orangutan...

528
00:45:37,459 --> 00:45:39,972
Can you believe this idiot?

529
00:45:41,178 --> 00:45:42,736
He's crazy.

530
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:46,937
Your Majesty,

531
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,808
I am a desperate father

532
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:53,888
and this was done only to prove
that, if put to 'The Question'

533
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,177
even the most innocent man
of cloth

534
00:45:56,901 --> 00:45:59,936
will confess to the most
preposterous absurdities.

535
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,689
Yes.

536
00:46:04,901 --> 00:46:07,779
We beg you, Your Majesty,
please use your authority

537
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:10,892
to restore our daughter to us.

538
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,012
Yes,
I will see what I can do for her.

539
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,097
I had a good look at the signature.

540
00:46:20,103 --> 00:46:23,858
- There can be no mistake?
- It is Lorenzo's.

541
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:28,059
Where is Brother Lorenzo?

542
00:46:28,342 --> 00:46:30,617
All the brothers are looking
for him, Father).

543
00:46:34,983 --> 00:46:37,020
- Yes?
- Francisco Goya y Lucientes?

544
00:46:38,183 --> 00:46:39,412
At your service.

545
00:46:39,984 --> 00:46:41,940
We have been told
that you are painting

546
00:46:42,104 --> 00:46:43,902
a portrait
of Lorenzo Casamares.

547
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:46,459
Yes, please come in.

548
00:46:46,822 --> 00:46:48,941
It's already finished.
This way.

549
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:50,942
I hope Father Lorenzo

550
00:46:51,105 --> 00:46:53,573
is pleased with the frame
we've chosen for it.

551
00:46:57,504 --> 00:47:00,065
Lorenzo Casamares
disgraced himself

552
00:47:00,225 --> 00:47:01,816
and he is now a fugitive.

553
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,184
A fugitive?

554
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:05,613
I see.

555
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:08,338
We're here to confiscate
the portrait.

556
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,303
Yes, of course.

557
00:47:13,746 --> 00:47:16,180
If he were to contact you,

558
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:18,623
we would like
to be notified immediately.

559
00:47:18,827 --> 00:47:20,385
Well, certainly.

560
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:25,539
Oh, incidentally,

561
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:31,737
I have not yet been paid
for the painting.

562
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:35,100
If we find him,
we'll remind him.

563
00:48:15,552 --> 00:48:18,065
As the image of the man

564
00:48:18,231 --> 00:48:20,588
vanishes into thin air...

565
00:48:22,512 --> 00:48:25,025
may his name forever vanish

566
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:27,581
from all memory.

567
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,545
Whosoever pronounces his name

568
00:48:32,154 --> 00:48:34,668
may he burn in the fires

569
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:37,222
of eternal damnation.

570
00:49:17,636 --> 00:49:21,551
She will like this frame.
You've done beautiful work.

571
00:49:22,316 --> 00:49:25,149
I've never been this close
to our Queen.

572
00:49:25,877 --> 00:49:29,028
But... is she really that ugly?

573
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:32,751
What's your point?
It's a beautiful painting.

574
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:36,428
Yes, but that does not make
a Queen beautiful.

575
00:50:29,523 --> 00:50:30,194
Don Francisco,

576
00:50:30,763 --> 00:50:33,914
Her Majesty wishes for you
to go to His Majesty's chamber.

577
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:50,878
Please, sit.

578
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:55,760
Sit, please.

579
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:58,482
Please, sit

580
00:51:53,969 --> 00:51:55,085
How did you like it?

581
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,250
Very much, Your Majesty.
Very much.

582
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:02,798
- Are you telling me the truth?
- I am, I am. I was very...

583
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,326
moved, Your Majesty.

584
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:06,561
Not now.

585
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,961
Do you know
who composed that piece?

586
00:52:10,012 --> 00:52:12,400
No, not really, sire.

587
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:17,088
Mozart, maybe? No.

588
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:21,209
Händel?

589
00:52:23,011 --> 00:52:25,445
- I did.
- Really?

590
00:52:27,733 --> 00:52:29,724
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

591
00:52:29,932 --> 00:52:32,208
Excellent and beautifully
performed. performed.

592
00:52:34,811 --> 00:52:36,768
- So much for art.
- Now, sire,

593
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:40,014
I wonder if I could have
your opinion on my...

594
00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:42,766
All right, come in.

595
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:52,084
Your Majesty...
I have come from Paris.

596
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,972
The French rabble

597
00:52:55,575 --> 00:52:58,213
has decapitated the King
of France.

598
00:52:58,934 --> 00:53:01,291
The King of France?

599
00:53:01,455 --> 00:53:03,686
Yes, Your Majesty.
King Louis.

600
00:53:03,895 --> 00:53:06,888
He was guillotined
in a public execution

601
00:53:07,055 --> 00:53:08,331
six days ago.

602
00:53:09,776 --> 00:53:11,653
My cousin Louis?

603
00:53:12,136 --> 00:53:13,695
Yes, sire.

604
00:53:38,939 --> 00:53:40,167
15 YEARS LATER

605
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:43,570
Our soldiers must comprehend
the noble purpose of their mission.

606
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,809
They carry a personal message
from me, Napoleon Bonaparte,

607
00:53:47,017 --> 00:53:50,295
that I will not stand by
and watch our Spanish neighbors

608
00:53:50,498 --> 00:53:52,650
continue to suffer the tyranny

609
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,811
of corrupt and decadent kings,

610
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,011
repressive clergy
and foreign imposters.

611
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:01,179
Yes, the King of Spain
is not even Spanish.

612
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:03,496
He is French.
And the Queen of Spain...

613
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:05,975
She is Italian!

614
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,498
No wonder the Spanish people
hate the Royal Family

615
00:54:09,701 --> 00:54:12,535
as much as they hate
the Inquisition.

616
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,736
You have never fought

617
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:17,971
an easier campaign, soldiers!

618
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:22,736
The common folk will greet you
with flowers and kisses

619
00:54:22,942 --> 00:54:25,137
on the streets of Madrid!

620
00:54:25,343 --> 00:54:28,857
The Spaniard cannot wait
to break his chains

621
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:32,212
and become a free man.

622
00:54:32,422 --> 00:54:34,301
Long live Napoleon.

623
00:55:38,828 --> 00:55:42,615
I can see these explosions
but I can't hear them.

624
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,266
I'm deaf.

625
00:55:45,748 --> 00:55:49,538
I am completely deaf now,
but every morning

626
00:55:49,749 --> 00:55:53,425
I thank the Lord that
He hasn't taken my sight away

627
00:55:53,629 --> 00:55:55,585
that I've been able to witness

628
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,340
and record
what has been happening here.

629
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:06,986
These are French soldiers.

630
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,825
The Mamelukes.

631
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,340
Special cavalry recruited
from Egypt by Napoleon

632
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,347
to help liberate Spain.

633
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,859
To bring us the noble ideas
of the French Revolution.

634
00:56:19,832 --> 00:56:21,265
Liberty,

635
00:56:21,473 --> 00:56:22,587
equality,

636
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:23,986
brotherhood.

637
00:56:25,672 --> 00:56:28,505
Then to defend the ideas
of the Revolution

638
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:31,945
Napoleon, this scourge of royalty,

639
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:35,941
made his own brother,
Joseph, the King of Spain.

640
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,266
But to my fellow Spaniard,

641
00:56:38,754 --> 00:56:42,222
Napoleon's armies are nothing
but foreign invaders,

642
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:44,302
occupiers.

643
00:57:02,796 --> 00:57:05,264
Who is in command
of this place?

644
00:57:08,476 --> 00:57:10,113
God

645
00:57:10,555 --> 00:57:12,625
is in command of this

646
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:16,951
and every other place
on this earth, my son.

647
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:21,833
- In the name of Emperor Napoleon...
- Continue.

648
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:24,232
...and by the letter
of the Rights...

649
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,029
Brother? Brother?

650
00:57:39,237 --> 00:57:41,753
Brothers, give him air,
let him breathe here.

651
00:57:44,113 --> 00:57:46,945
In the name of Emperor Napoleon
and by the letter

652
00:57:47,153 --> 00:57:50,827
of the Declaration of the Rights
of Man and of the Citizen,

653
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:54,822
we hereby proclaim
the Spanish Inquisition abolished.

654
00:57:55,314 --> 00:57:58,032
All of its properties confiscated

655
00:57:58,234 --> 00:58:02,021
and all of its prisoners
will be freed forthwith.

656
01:00:58,769 --> 01:01:00,806
Now, go away.

657
01:01:02,731 --> 01:01:04,639
I'm deaf.

658
01:01:04,848 --> 01:01:06,406
I'm deaf!

659
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:20,086
Sit down. Sit down.

660
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:27,284
You have to write,
write everything down.

661
01:01:28,931 --> 01:01:31,765
Write what happened,
I can't hear.

662
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:33,959
Are you hungry?

663
01:01:35,252 --> 01:01:37,447
Are you hungry?

664
01:01:44,011 --> 01:01:45,570
I confessed,

665
01:01:46,613 --> 01:01:49,446
and they said I would be tried,

666
01:01:50,093 --> 01:01:52,288
but there was never a trial.

667
01:01:53,694 --> 01:01:55,889
My father is dead now.

668
01:01:57,654 --> 01:01:59,849
My whole family is dead.

669
01:02:07,253 --> 01:02:11,043
The only thing I can think
about is my child.

670
01:02:12,015 --> 01:02:13,892
You had a child?

671
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:15,933
In prison?

672
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:25,409
My daughter, my little girl.

673
01:02:25,936 --> 01:02:27,928
I need to see her.

674
01:02:28,137 --> 01:02:30,129
I need to take care of her.

675
01:02:30,297 --> 01:02:32,969
Can you help me find her?
Please?

676
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:43,207
Inés, look at me.

677
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:46,410
Swear to God Almighty
you're telling the truth.

678
01:02:52,419 --> 01:02:55,296
I need to talk to somebody
from the Holy Office.

679
01:02:55,498 --> 01:02:58,013
But the Holy Office is long gone.

680
01:03:00,138 --> 01:03:02,971
- But they're not all dead, are they?
- They might as well be.

681
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,692
They're either all in prison
or on the run.

682
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,378
- Who's running the prison?
- The French.

683
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:14,218
And Napoleon has sent

684
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,690
a special prosecutor along
with his army.

685
01:03:20,341 --> 01:03:23,094
Will he receive me?
Where would I find him?

686
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,689
Stay here. Watch her.

687
01:03:31,901 --> 01:03:33,459
Felipe!

688
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:51,692
Silence!

689
01:03:56,104 --> 01:03:56,776
Silence!

690
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:04,541
Quiet!

691
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:19,016
I am here

692
01:04:19,186 --> 01:04:23,179
to serve the ideas of the
great French Revolution!

693
01:04:32,347 --> 01:04:34,256
They opened my eyes,

694
01:04:34,466 --> 01:04:37,618
as they are opening the eyes
of the blind all over the world,

695
01:04:37,827 --> 01:04:40,340
because they are irresistible.

696
01:04:41,348 --> 01:04:43,862
They are logical, they are just.

697
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:45,785
Universal.

698
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:57,225
All men, all men are born free.

699
01:04:58,148 --> 01:05:01,425
All possess the same rights,
and those...

700
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:04,781
...those who refuse
to see the light of liberty

701
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:06,702
shall receive no mercy.

702
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:08,706
There will be...

703
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:13,269
there will be no liberty
for the enemies of liberty!

704
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,989
Father Gregorio...

705
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:29,861
do not take this personally
However...

706
01:05:30,952 --> 01:05:33,102
However you are

707
01:05:33,272 --> 01:05:34,671
the very incarnation

708
01:05:34,832 --> 01:05:37,063
of blind fanaticism and nepotism.

709
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:40,426
You are the tool by the means
of which few

710
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:43,783
have kept the many in chains.

711
01:05:43,992 --> 01:05:47,987
You exemplify the very worst aspect
of Spain

712
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,344
and so you will be judged
for your deeds.

713
01:05:58,113 --> 01:06:02,106
By... By the unanimous decision
of the judges...

714
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,985
and by the power vested in them
by the Declaration

715
01:06:07,194 --> 01:06:10,346
of the Rights of Man
and of the Citizen,

716
01:06:10,555 --> 01:06:12,114
this court

717
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:14,067
sentences you...

718
01:06:16,036 --> 01:06:17,435
to death.

719
01:06:38,997 --> 01:06:41,511
Do you remember
that rich merchant

720
01:06:41,677 --> 01:06:44,066
that made you confess that you...

721
01:06:49,478 --> 01:06:50,708
Yes.

722
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,591
- You remember.
- Sí. What was his name?

723
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,391
Tomás Bilbatua.

724
01:06:57,598 --> 01:07:00,555
Yes, of course. How is he?

725
01:07:00,998 --> 01:07:02,399
Oh, he's dead.

726
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,871
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, it's his daughter.

727
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,757
She needs help.

728
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:13,514
Of course. She can come
to see me any time she wants.

729
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:16,394
Well, she's here.
She's in my carriage outside.

730
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:18,478
Bring her in.

731
01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:22,835
I owe everything...

732
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:31,309
- I owe everything to...
- No, you don't have to shout.

733
01:07:31,722 --> 01:07:33,917
You can just speak slowly

734
01:07:34,121 --> 01:07:36,954
and articulate
and I can read your lips.

735
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:42,917
I owe everything to that man.

736
01:07:43,122 --> 01:07:46,558
Because of him I had
to run to France.

737
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:49,118
And there suddenly,

738
01:07:49,284 --> 01:07:51,514
saw in one bright flash

739
01:07:51,723 --> 01:07:55,192
how terribly wrong I had been
all my life.

740
01:07:55,643 --> 01:07:56,871
Reading...

741
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:59,473
Reading Voltaire, Rousseau...

742
01:08:00,324 --> 01:08:02,237
Meeting Danton. Look,

743
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:04,481
I was baptized again.

744
01:08:04,924 --> 01:08:07,119
I shed blood
for the Revolution.

745
01:08:07,324 --> 01:08:10,999
- A nasty wound.
- And I even got married there.

746
01:08:11,203 --> 01:08:13,720
Yes, Henrietta, my wife.

747
01:08:14,606 --> 01:08:17,120
I love her...
And I have three children.

748
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:20,845
Yes, I who took the vows
of celibacy.

749
01:08:22,325 --> 01:08:25,237
So you will have to paint
my portrait

750
01:08:25,406 --> 01:08:27,396
with the whole family.

751
01:08:27,845 --> 01:08:29,074
That's...

752
01:08:29,807 --> 01:08:32,321
That's ten hands to paint.

753
01:08:32,966 --> 01:08:36,438
Ten.
And I can afford them all now.

754
01:08:37,048 --> 01:08:38,685
Come in.

755
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:42,996
Inés.

756
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:47,483
- This is Lorenzo...
- Casamares.

757
01:08:47,688 --> 01:08:49,680
Lorenzo Casamares.

758
01:08:51,448 --> 01:08:53,244
What can I do for you, miss?

759
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:56,721
Don't, no, no, please, stop this,
stop.

760
01:08:57,087 --> 01:08:58,967
Stop, please.

761
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:01,408
Sit down.

762
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:04,237
Sit.

763
01:09:04,929 --> 01:09:06,806
Just tell me

764
01:09:07,169 --> 01:09:10,320
what do you need?
What can I do for you?

765
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:14,203
What happened to our child?

766
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:17,564
- I beg your pardon?
- Is she...?

767
01:09:19,011 --> 01:09:20,886
Is she with you?

768
01:09:29,892 --> 01:09:33,043
How long did they keep you
in that prison?

769
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,567
I don't know.

770
01:09:37,811 --> 01:09:39,040
And...

771
01:09:40,772 --> 01:09:43,492
you think you had a child
in there?

772
01:09:43,692 --> 01:09:45,570
A little girl.

773
01:09:46,134 --> 01:09:48,771
- Our daughter
- "Our" daughter?

774
01:09:53,373 --> 01:09:56,649
Why do you believe that I am
the father of your little girl?

775
01:09:58,254 --> 01:10:00,052
Because you're

776
01:10:00,214 --> 01:10:02,682
the only man I've ever known.

777
01:10:03,455 --> 01:10:05,969
Please, sit down,
sit down, please.

778
01:10:15,255 --> 01:10:17,371
What happened to the child?

779
01:10:17,576 --> 01:10:19,451
I don't know.

780
01:10:20,094 --> 01:10:22,291
They took her from me

781
01:10:22,496 --> 01:10:23,723
before...

782
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:27,491
she even tasted my milk.

783
01:10:50,777 --> 01:10:52,655
Inés, my dear, come here.

784
01:10:52,936 --> 01:10:54,495
Come, come.

785
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,258
Now,

786
01:10:58,459 --> 01:11:01,451
you will go
with this nice young man

787
01:11:01,659 --> 01:11:04,254
and he will take you
to your daughter.

788
01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:06,017
All right?

789
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:09,215
You just go with him.

790
01:11:09,861 --> 01:11:13,330
Go on.
Everything will be fine.

791
01:11:24,061 --> 01:11:25,938
I feel...

792
01:11:27,381 --> 01:11:30,531
such pity for these poor souls.

793
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,738
How barbaric we were...

794
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:36,893
Where are you sending her?

795
01:11:37,262 --> 01:11:40,095
She has obviously taken leave
of her senses in jail.

796
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:46,250
However, I will not fail her.
I promise you.

797
01:11:46,461 --> 01:11:49,181
- Will she be all right?
- She will be well provided for.

798
01:11:49,382 --> 01:11:52,612
You think she invented the story
about her child?

799
01:11:55,104 --> 01:11:57,937
I'm afraid so.
I'm sure she did.

800
01:12:00,144 --> 01:12:01,703
Tell me...

801
01:12:02,543 --> 01:12:04,579
if a prisoner gave birth

802
01:12:04,743 --> 01:12:06,655
in the dungeons
of the Holy Office,

803
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:10,578
what would have happened
to the child?

804
01:12:13,826 --> 01:12:15,702
Might it concern

805
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:18,863
your child?

806
01:12:19,946 --> 01:12:21,172
Please,

807
01:12:22,346 --> 01:12:24,701
respond to my question.

808
01:12:25,346 --> 01:12:26,903
If I do,

809
01:12:27,625 --> 01:12:31,302
will you spare whatever remains
of my life?

810
01:12:31,507 --> 01:12:34,340
Will you kindly let me die
in peace?

811
01:12:36,347 --> 01:12:37,985
Yes.

812
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:43,464
Can I trust a... a monkey?

813
01:12:48,308 --> 01:12:49,705
Yes.

814
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:57,264
There are no girls here born in '93
and brought from Madrid?

815
01:12:58,108 --> 01:12:59,986
Are there?

816
01:13:02,468 --> 01:13:05,941
There was one who would answer
that description.

817
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,741
1793, Madrid,

818
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,423
sent here
by the Holy Office.

819
01:13:13,629 --> 01:13:15,027
Which one is she?

820
01:13:15,228 --> 01:13:16,902
She's not here.

821
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:19,379
She ran away from us
when she was only 11.

822
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:22,028
Where is she now?

823
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,586
Only God can answer
that question.

824
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:27,145
She was a little tiger.

825
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:32,786
Is it known
who her parents were?

826
01:13:35,353 --> 01:13:36,910
Not really.

827
01:13:40,793 --> 01:13:42,747
Did they mention their names?

828
01:13:43,432 --> 01:13:46,265
Oh, no. They never do.

829
01:13:48,552 --> 01:13:51,227
- Did you baptize her?
- Oh, immediately.

830
01:13:51,434 --> 01:13:53,629
What was her baptismal name?

831
01:13:54,073 --> 01:13:54,903
Alicia.

832
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:56,867
Alicia.

833
01:13:57,273 --> 01:13:58,502
Alicia.

834
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:01,191
Come on.

835
01:14:39,678 --> 01:14:41,235
Come on.

836
01:14:53,038 --> 01:14:56,588
- Who was that girl there?
- Her name is Alicia. She's sweet...

837
01:14:56,798 --> 01:14:59,358
- What's her name?
- Alicia.

838
01:14:59,558 --> 01:15:01,436
Write it down.

839
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,799
Alicia.

840
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:05,751
All right. Alicia.

841
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:08,793
- Will she be back?
- Oh, no, no, not today. Tomorrow.

842
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:11,751
- What?
- You can have her tomorrow.

843
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,397
My God, what is this?

844
01:15:19,201 --> 01:15:21,431
This is by the Flemish painter
Hieronymous Bosch...

845
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,438
El Bosco, sire.

846
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,751
It's called
'The Garden of Earthly Delights'.

847
01:15:26,241 --> 01:15:28,232
- Do you like this?
- Well,

848
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,197
it is very bizarre, you are right,
but of course it's Flemish.

849
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:34,916
And it is very well painted.

850
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:38,157
This is neither my kind of a garden
nor my kind of delights.

851
01:15:39,043 --> 01:15:41,191
I would never send this
to Napoleon.

852
01:15:41,401 --> 01:15:44,155
This is not my brother's taste...
No!

853
01:15:44,362 --> 01:15:46,272
You can keep this thing right
here in Madrid.

854
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:53,516
Ah, now this looks promising.

855
01:15:53,724 --> 01:15:56,032
This is Carlos the Fourth.

856
01:15:56,244 --> 01:15:59,156
I met him... and his wife.

857
01:15:59,522 --> 01:16:01,720
Although I don't recall her being
that ugly.

858
01:16:02,484 --> 01:16:05,318
How did she manage
to have so many lovers?

859
01:16:05,524 --> 01:16:08,039
She was the Queen, sire.

860
01:16:10,403 --> 01:16:12,760
This... is a masterpiece.

861
01:16:12,965 --> 01:16:16,322
- Indeed it is, sire.
- My brother would appreciate this.

862
01:16:17,445 --> 01:16:19,755
And he can just do that?

863
01:16:19,965 --> 01:16:23,402
Take paintings from the Royal gallery
and pack them off to Paris?

864
01:16:23,606 --> 01:16:26,563
We have to express our gratitude
for what Napoleon did for freedom

865
01:16:26,766 --> 01:16:29,997
in Spain somehow darling. Yes?

866
01:16:31,408 --> 01:16:34,080
Senor Francisco de Goya
is here to see you, sir.

867
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:36,165
- Bring him in.
- Wait!

868
01:16:40,486 --> 01:16:43,956
Show Senor Goya to my study
and kindly ask him to wait.

869
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:45,922
Thank you.

870
01:16:56,927 --> 01:16:59,123
I'm sorry, Francisco.

871
01:16:59,289 --> 01:17:01,359
At lunch I'm a family man.

872
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:04,564
- May I offer you something to drink?
- No, thank you, no.

873
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,407
I just want to get in touch
with Inés Bilbatua.

874
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:09,848
Why?

875
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:12,718
Well, she was telling the truth.

876
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:15,444
She does have a daughter.

877
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:17,808
How do you know?

878
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:20,923
- I saw her.
- You saw her?

879
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:22,919
Yes.

880
01:17:23,531 --> 01:17:25,646
Did you talk to her?

881
01:17:25,851 --> 01:17:27,728
No, no, I just saw her.

882
01:17:27,931 --> 01:17:31,844
How do you know that the girl
you saw is Inés's daughter?

883
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:35,569
She looked exactly
like her mother did

884
01:17:35,732 --> 01:17:37,642
when I painted her 16 years ago.

885
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:41,640
- She was, it was a perfect replica.
- Where did you see her?

886
01:17:45,814 --> 01:17:48,202
In the Pardo Gardens.

887
01:17:49,652 --> 01:17:52,167
- In the Gardens?
- Yes.

888
01:17:53,652 --> 01:17:55,529
She is a...?

889
01:17:57,534 --> 01:17:59,525
Yes, she is.

890
01:18:00,694 --> 01:18:02,572
Do you know her name?

891
01:18:03,815 --> 01:18:05,452
- Alicia.
- Alicia.

892
01:18:05,653 --> 01:18:08,805
Do you think you could bring Inés
to my house?

893
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:12,087
I want the mother
to meet her daughter.

894
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:13,563
Of course.

895
01:18:16,895 --> 01:18:18,453
Come on.

896
01:18:36,256 --> 01:18:39,055
- Is your name Alicia?
- Yes.

897
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:43,691
Where were you born, Alicia?

898
01:18:44,418 --> 01:18:46,453
In an orphanage.

899
01:18:46,857 --> 01:18:49,371
Do you know
who your parents were?

900
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:52,567
My mother was a heretic.

901
01:19:06,218 --> 01:19:08,255
So, where do you wanna do it?

902
01:19:08,419 --> 01:19:09,488
Right here?

903
01:19:09,698 --> 01:19:12,817
Nowhere.
I just want to talk to you.

904
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:16,176
You're not the police, are you?

905
01:19:19,062 --> 01:19:21,574
I would like to make you
a proposition.

906
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:25,254
- All right.
- Leave Spain.

907
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,258
- Leave Spain?
- Yes.

908
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,020
- And go where?
- America.

909
01:19:29,221 --> 01:19:30,702
With you?

910
01:19:30,902 --> 01:19:32,857
No, but...

911
01:19:33,461 --> 01:19:35,338
if you leave Spain,

912
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:39,330
I will provide you with enough money
that you will never want for...

913
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,817
No, no, please let me out of the...

914
01:19:42,023 --> 01:19:43,979
- Now, please, stop this...!
- Wait, calm down. Let me speak.

915
01:19:44,183 --> 01:19:46,491
I'm not gonna end up
in some brothel or harem?

916
01:19:46,703 --> 01:19:47,976
Let me speak.

917
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:51,254
- Let go of me, or I'll scream.
- Wait, stay here.

918
01:19:51,462 --> 01:19:53,580
Wait... Quiet, quiet.

919
01:19:53,944 --> 01:19:57,856
Quiet, quiet. Let me speak.
Quiet! Wait!

920
01:19:58,224 --> 01:20:00,021
Alicia, come back!

921
01:20:01,545 --> 01:20:04,376
Even if this Alicia actually
were Inés's daughter,

922
01:20:04,743 --> 01:20:07,258
which I doubt, which I doubt...

923
01:20:09,144 --> 01:20:11,022
If she were,

924
01:20:11,465 --> 01:20:14,616
I would never want to bring
those two together.

925
01:20:14,904 --> 01:20:16,462
Why not?

926
01:20:16,665 --> 01:20:18,542
For me,
the idea of telling a mother:

927
01:20:18,746 --> 01:20:20,781
"I found your daughter
and she's a whore"

928
01:20:20,945 --> 01:20:22,856
is unthinkable and cruel.

929
01:20:23,865 --> 01:20:26,221
I could never bring myself
to do it.

930
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:28,582
But they're the same flesh
and blood.

931
01:20:28,788 --> 01:20:30,539
Plus, Francisco,

932
01:20:32,186 --> 01:20:36,019
Inés is not in control
of her senses.

933
01:20:38,906 --> 01:20:41,945
- Where is she?
- She's in very good hands.

934
01:20:42,148 --> 01:20:44,298
Where?
I need to talk to her.

935
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:46,504
Why is she so important to you?

936
01:20:47,268 --> 01:20:50,418
You are completely obsessed
with her.

937
01:20:51,506 --> 01:20:53,625
You yourself noticed her.

938
01:20:53,829 --> 01:20:57,378
That face is...
engraved on my mind.

939
01:20:58,189 --> 01:21:01,099
She's the angel descending
from heaven in 'La Florida'.

940
01:21:01,308 --> 01:21:04,824
I see her in taverns, I see her
in the streets, in my dreams.

941
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:08,860
I saw her face when I thought
I was dying in Cádiz.

942
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:11,105
And I didn't do anything for her
when she needed it.

943
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,504
I'm not going
to abandon her again!

944
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:15,905
Can you understand that?

945
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:19,547
Where is she?

946
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:24,619
Francisco,

947
01:21:26,992 --> 01:21:30,300
that poor woman
has lost her mind.

948
01:21:32,871 --> 01:21:34,589
I said where is she?

949
01:21:37,832 --> 01:21:40,791
- I don't care who you are.
- I'm painter to the King!

950
01:21:41,472 --> 01:21:44,943
To which King? Do you know how
many kings I have in here?

951
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:48,623
I even have two Napoleons.
And one of them is an Arab.

952
01:21:48,832 --> 01:21:51,712
The other one is seven foot,
two inches tall.

953
01:21:53,193 --> 01:21:55,424
- Is he deaf?
- Yeah.

954
01:21:56,154 --> 01:21:58,986
Painter to the King.
He could be blind.

955
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:02,183
So, who is this woman anyway?

956
01:22:04,394 --> 01:22:05,462
Inés Bilbatua.

957
01:22:06,874 --> 01:22:09,024
How much is she worth to you?

958
01:22:10,874 --> 01:22:14,663
- How much is she worth to you?
- One thousand reales.

959
01:22:15,155 --> 01:22:17,350
1,000? 100!

960
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:19,672
100!

961
01:22:19,876 --> 01:22:23,709
You must be crazy! And take it
as a professional opinion!

962
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:26,954
There are revolutions everywhere,
the world is going to hell.

963
01:22:27,157 --> 01:22:29,032
The British have landed
in Portugal

964
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:30,914
and I am responsible
for this hospital.

965
01:22:31,116 --> 01:22:34,630
And you have the audacity
to offer me 100?

966
01:22:34,836 --> 01:22:36,713
500. 500.

967
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:39,750
- 200.
- All right.

968
01:22:40,877 --> 01:22:43,072
Is there anybody else here
that he wants?

969
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:05,278
Inés.

970
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,593
Oh, no... Not again.

971
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:14,989
You cannot carry a baby
all your life. No woman can.

972
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:20,116
No, María, no!

973
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,079
- Stop it!
- Inés!

974
01:23:22,441 --> 01:23:23,874
Hold her.

975
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,754
Get her! Stop it!

976
01:23:25,962 --> 01:23:28,077
Stop it. Let her go!

977
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,919
- Inés, calm down.
- Inés!

978
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:33,117
Inés!

979
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:38,598
Don't you remember me?

980
01:23:41,962 --> 01:23:42,998
You can go home now.

981
01:23:45,122 --> 01:23:47,193
I found your daughter, Inés.

982
01:23:48,485 --> 01:23:49,712
See,

983
01:23:49,883 --> 01:23:52,603
you have to go.
He has found your daughter.

984
01:23:55,084 --> 01:23:57,198
- My daughter?
- Yes.

985
01:23:58,362 --> 01:23:59,796
My baby?

986
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,352
Halt!

987
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:22,157
What's happening here?
Why can't we go through?

988
01:24:25,445 --> 01:24:27,323
You can't go there.

989
01:24:27,925 --> 01:24:29,803
Inés, wait in the carriage.

990
01:24:31,045 --> 01:24:33,241
You keep an eye on her.

991
01:25:47,293 --> 01:25:48,931
Miss Alicia?

992
01:25:50,373 --> 01:25:52,125
Yes.

993
01:25:53,052 --> 01:25:54,929
I'm Francisco Goya.

994
01:25:56,053 --> 01:25:58,249
I'm painter to the King.

995
01:26:01,814 --> 01:26:03,725
Is that your child?

996
01:26:04,173 --> 01:26:05,083
No.

997
01:26:06,934 --> 01:26:10,085
I want you to come
with me and meet somebody.

998
01:26:10,494 --> 01:26:12,485
Another man?

999
01:26:13,214 --> 01:26:14,888
No.

1000
01:26:15,935 --> 01:26:17,527
I understand.

1001
01:26:17,735 --> 01:26:19,853
No, I'm not talking about...

1002
01:26:20,056 --> 01:26:22,204
I want you to meet somebody
to whom you are very important.

1003
01:26:22,415 --> 01:26:23,244
Who?

1004
01:26:30,376 --> 01:26:31,696
Alicia,

1005
01:26:31,897 --> 01:26:34,286
you've never met your mother,
have you?

1006
01:26:35,736 --> 01:26:36,965
And?

1007
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:57,685
Alicia!

1008
01:26:59,018 --> 01:27:00,896
Alicia, run!

1009
01:27:04,298 --> 01:27:06,176
No, don't touch her!

1010
01:27:07,299 --> 01:27:08,937
Alicia!

1011
01:27:52,862 --> 01:27:55,058
- Where is she?
- She went that way.

1012
01:27:55,262 --> 01:27:57,937
But didn't I tell you...!
Go find her!

1013
01:27:58,144 --> 01:28:00,578
I said Don Francisco wants you
to stay here.

1014
01:28:00,784 --> 01:28:03,014
Bring her home! Bring her home!

1015
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:05,027
Bring him in.

1016
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:16,422
- Did you decree that deportation?
- Yes.

1017
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:21,144
So you're sending all these girls
to America

1018
01:29:21,671 --> 01:29:24,137
just to get your poor harlot
daughter out of the way?

1019
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:28,026
This is the best thing for those
women, it's the best thing.

1020
01:29:28,192 --> 01:29:30,067
What are you saying?
Say it again.

1021
01:29:30,271 --> 01:29:32,149
It is a new life for them.
It is a new life.

1022
01:29:33,112 --> 01:29:35,989
A new life? To be sold
as slaves in America?

1023
01:29:36,191 --> 01:29:39,549
It is better than living
in this whorehouse called Spain.

1024
01:29:39,754 --> 01:29:42,789
- What are you saying?
- Wake up, Francisco.

1025
01:29:42,992 --> 01:29:45,746
The Spanish people couldn't care
less about ideals.

1026
01:29:45,953 --> 01:29:49,229
Spain today
is one big whorehouse.

1027
01:29:50,072 --> 01:29:51,267
Whore?

1028
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:55,709
Are you calling me a whore?

1029
01:29:56,113 --> 01:29:58,787
You have the audacity
to call me a whore?

1030
01:29:58,992 --> 01:30:01,508
And what are you? Look at you!

1031
01:30:01,794 --> 01:30:03,625
Look what you are today.

1032
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:05,950
But do you remember
what you were yesterday?

1033
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:09,187
Who's the whore here?

1034
01:30:10,235 --> 01:30:13,069
Don't lecture me, Francisco.

1035
01:30:13,876 --> 01:30:17,627
Do not lecture me.
At least I tried to do something

1036
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:19,826
- and believed in what I was doing.
- Wait.

1037
01:30:20,034 --> 01:30:21,786
- I am a believer, Francisco.
- Wait.

1038
01:30:21,994 --> 01:30:24,829
I am a believer...! But you?

1039
01:30:25,436 --> 01:30:27,313
Look at you.

1040
01:30:28,195 --> 01:30:30,949
You work for anyone
who pays.

1041
01:30:31,156 --> 01:30:33,067
Yesterday the King of Spain.

1042
01:30:33,276 --> 01:30:35,744
Today the French.
Tomorrow?

1043
01:30:35,916 --> 01:30:38,227
Probably that bastard Wellington!

1044
01:30:38,438 --> 01:30:40,632
- No!
- Yes, Francisco.

1045
01:30:41,117 --> 01:30:43,632
You only believe in money.

1046
01:30:44,796 --> 01:30:46,276
You are the whore.

1047
01:30:50,637 --> 01:30:52,277
What is it?

1048
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:03,751
The King has just received news

1049
01:31:04,678 --> 01:31:07,638
that the British have crossed
the border from Portugal to Spain

1050
01:31:07,841 --> 01:31:09,478
and are advancing.

1051
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:13,918
According to a reliable source,
they are not meeting any resistance

1052
01:31:14,118 --> 01:31:17,908
and the Spanish are joining them
in their assault on our outposts.

1053
01:31:18,759 --> 01:31:20,511
What are the King's orders?

1054
01:31:20,718 --> 01:31:23,998
The King and his family left
for Madrid half an hour ago.

1055
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:29,752
- And Madrid?
- News hasn't reached the city yet.

1056
01:32:28,046 --> 01:32:29,684
Inés.

1057
01:32:33,366 --> 01:32:35,404
I want her to sleep.

1058
01:32:35,568 --> 01:32:37,479
Her father has not seen her yet.

1059
01:32:38,207 --> 01:32:41,676
Oh, I don't want her to be crying
when she sees him.

1060
01:33:36,332 --> 01:33:37,561
Wait!

1061
01:33:47,011 --> 01:33:48,241
Halt!

1062
01:33:50,973 --> 01:33:53,362
Back to France, you cowards!

1063
01:34:48,898 --> 01:34:50,125
Françoise?

1064
01:35:40,142 --> 01:35:41,700
Brother Lorenzo,

1065
01:35:42,542 --> 01:35:46,012
I hope you will understand there
is nothing personal

1066
01:35:46,303 --> 01:35:47,372
in our judgment.

1067
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:48,497
However,

1068
01:35:49,382 --> 01:35:51,499
you became

1069
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:54,461
the living embodiment
of diabolical ideas.

1070
01:35:57,103 --> 01:36:00,254
You proclaimed that Man
is higher than God

1071
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:04,574
and that the words of the Gospels
are nothing but lies and poison.

1072
01:36:06,983 --> 01:36:08,861
You must never

1073
01:36:09,223 --> 01:36:12,295
never be allowed
to repeat your crimes.

1074
01:36:13,103 --> 01:36:15,984
Therefore,
the Church declares you guilty,

1075
01:36:16,626 --> 01:36:19,459
and your punishment
will be death.

1076
01:36:20,745 --> 01:36:23,896
But if you repent publicly,

1077
01:36:24,104 --> 01:36:26,700
the merciful hand
of the Church

1078
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:28,465
will spare your life.

1079
01:36:31,987 --> 01:36:34,820
Your body will be saved,
and even your soul,

1080
01:36:35,028 --> 01:36:36,664
if you join us again

1081
01:36:36,825 --> 01:36:39,136
in the ever- loving arms
of God.

1082
01:36:43,067 --> 01:36:44,295
Lorenzo,

1083
01:36:45,107 --> 01:36:46,745
my son,

1084
01:36:54,508 --> 01:36:56,703
will you repent?

1085
01:37:35,151 --> 01:37:36,823
No, I'm sure.

1086
01:38:04,353 --> 01:38:06,709
- In the name of the Father...
- God will forgive your sins.

1087
01:38:06,913 --> 01:38:09,950
You have lost your sight, Brother.
Open your eyes.

1088
01:38:10,794 --> 01:38:12,308
Lorenzo!

1089
01:38:12,514 --> 01:38:13,584
Lorenzo!

1090
01:38:14,155 --> 01:38:16,873
Lorenzo! Over here!

1091
01:38:17,315 --> 01:38:19,545
Well, what do you think's going
to happen to him now?

1092
01:38:19,755 --> 01:38:23,635
Brother, repent. You still have
time to plead for God's mercy.

1093
01:38:23,836 --> 01:38:25,715
Repent. Repent.

1094
01:38:41,357 --> 01:38:44,827
Come back to us, and God
will receive you into His arms.

1095
01:38:46,557 --> 01:38:47,628
Open your eyes!

1096
01:38:55,319 --> 01:38:57,513
Repent.
God will forgive your sins

1097
01:38:57,679 --> 01:38:59,750
if you repent now! Repent...

1098
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:05,592
Oh God.

1099
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,753
Or you'll be damned
for all eternity.

1100
01:39:09,158 --> 01:39:12,630
God will forgive your sins.
You have lost your sight, Brother.

1101
01:39:12,959 --> 01:39:15,598
You still have time to plead
for God's mercy.

1102
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:18,235
For God is all merciful.
