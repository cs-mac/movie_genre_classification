1
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,640
Paulo's next.

2
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,050
He is also one of us! He downed his glass like everyone!

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,600
BEYOND THE WALLS

4
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,670
Fucking hell!

5
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,680
You have to help me here!

6
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,700
Bloody Hell!

7
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,500
Here...

8
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
I don't even know your name.

9
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,000
Ilir.

10
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
What does it mean? Where's it from?

11
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,200
Ilir, it's Albanian.

12
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,850
The Mafia?

13
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,000
OK, I see... you've got your head full of stereotypes.

14
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,030
Sugar?

15
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,100
Yes, thanks.

16
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,300
It means freedom in French.

17
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,150
- Can I bite mine too? - Sure, but have some water first.

18
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,280
Drink. You've got to dilute your hangover, trust me!

19
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,200
- Finish it! - No, I can't.

20
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,490
Trust me, you need to get rid of the toxins.

21
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,280
Or you'll feel like shit all day.

22
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Good... drink, drink... swallow.

23
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,600
Don't choke yourself.

24
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,840
- I can't anymore - Thats fine.

25
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,000
- Go, if you have to - No, it's OK.

26
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Was that your girlfriend?

27
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,900
No.

28
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,760
No, it wasn't... well yes, but not really.

29
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,240
Fine, say no more, I get it.

30
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,500
What do you mean?

31
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,320
You're still trying to figure it out, aren't you?

32
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,570
No.

33
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Yes, I mean... you could say that.

34
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
- I can't remember last night - That's probably a good thing.

35
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,270
- Why? - Never mind...

36
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,520
No, go on, tell me...

37
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,480
We snogged, you wanted to suck my cock.

38
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,460
- Oh, no no... no - Oh yes... yes you did.

39
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,320
But it's OK, it's no big deal.

40
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm really sorry.

41
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,880
Hey, I was joking.

42
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Where were you?

43
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,100
Don't you have stuff to do?

44
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,700
I looked for yo.u everywhere, you could have called.

45
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,480
I was out of credit... my phone battery was dead.

46
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,620
Where did you sleep?

47
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,240
I don't know anymore.

48
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,500
I can't remember, I don't know...

49
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,780
Was it a guy?

50
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,080
- Have you got one size up, or not? - I'll be with you, madam.

51
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,360
You promised you'd stop.

52
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,220
Tell me the truth.

53
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,400
There, that's the truth.

54
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,100
Hi.

55
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,680
- Alright? - Yeah, you?

56
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,350
Yeah, good... good.

57
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,900
I've got your T-shirt.

58
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,800
Thanks.

59
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,000
Thanks, that's nice of you.

60
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
I washed it.

61
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,100
I hope so.

62
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,900
- Do you want something to drink? - Yes.

63
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,860
I'll have whatever... a beer... a beer.

64
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,000
- It's fine like that. - OK,thanks a lot.

65
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,350
- See you soon. - Bye.

66
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,020
- You're not having one? - No, I'm at work.

67
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,150
But if you feel like it, I'm doing a concert on the 30th...

68
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,100
If you have nothing else on, if you feel like it...

69
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,750
Well, do what you want.

70
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,040
Isn't it possible before that?

71
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,500
No, because...

72
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,150
it's not my decision.

73
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,220
I'm going out with some mates.

74
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,750
- Oh no, not tonight. - Why, what's up?

75
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,710
I just wanted you to stay here with me.

76
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,500
Me too... another time?

77
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,900
But you can't go out with that look.

78
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,620
Where should we go?

79
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,090
Sorry, sorry... I'm sorry.

80
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,450
Let me see... I really went for it, sorry.

81
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,050
Can I taste?

82
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,000
You want, too?

83
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't resist. OK?

84
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,190
Just breath in, OK?

85
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,700
Do you love me?

86
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:53,760
Yes.

87
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,320
It doesn't feel like it.

88
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,500
You didn't even ask me how my meeting went.

89
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,140
- I did. - No.

90
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,820
OK, so I forgot.

91
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,230
How did it go?

92
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,300
It's too late now.

93
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,710
Sorry I forgot. I had other things on my mind...

94
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,040
You always have other things on your mind.

95
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,020
So what's up now? We're going to start this again?

96
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,820
This is no good.

97
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,400
You know it.

98
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,230
What? What's going on? What did I do?

99
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,250
We need to talk, you need to tell me the truth.

100
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,000
We need to talk!.

101
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,780
We do nothing but talk, bla bla bla all day.

102
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,150
Enough now, no?

103
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,220
Can I meet him?

104
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,420
I'm going to bed.

105
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,830
We should hook up again soon.

106
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,350
I miss you already.

107
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,030
I love you.

108
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,280
I want you to leave.

109
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,150
I've had enough.

110
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,350
I don't understand.

111
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,790
We're good together.

112
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,030
How can you say that?

113
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,750
It's been months since we've done anything.

114
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,000
Stop pressuring me all the time like that!

115
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,630
Get out! Get out!

116
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,050
- What, right now? - Yes.

117
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,830
Take your stuff and get out!

118
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,590
- No way! - Oh, yes.

119
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,630
Can you put me up?

120
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:52,510
We've seen each other twice. We hardly know each other.

121
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,310
We've seen each other three times.

122
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,600
Three times, if you prefer, but that changes nothing.

123
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,700
Where can I go?

124
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,830
- Your parents? - They live in the boonies.

125
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
Don't you know anyone who can put you up for one night?

126
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,750
I'd never beg you if I did.

127
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,550
Now is not a good time for me.

128
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,000
- Its burnt. - Give me two minutes.

129
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,230
Who is he?

130
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,110
Elina. This is Elina.

131
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,710
She's my sister!

132
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,350
Have you known each other long?

133
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,990
He's never mentioned you.

134
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,630
Leave him alone. He's a friend.

135
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,160
That's all.

136
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,590
- I'm only asking. - Mind your own business, OK!

137
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,430
What's wrong?

138
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,070
Nothing, don't worry.

139
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,830
I'll clean up.

140
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,630
- No wait I'll... - It's fine!

141
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,230
Leave that, I'll do it.

142
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,550
- What's the problem? - I want to be alone.

143
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,000
- He's here, isn't he? - Leave me alone!

144
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,250
As you wish.

145
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,500
Thanks.

146
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,210
No, I don't agree.

147
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:36,190
For tonight, just picture a line here, a frontier between us.

148
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,950
Are you punishing me?

149
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:51,290
Come on, move, get out of here...

150
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,310
There!

151
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,390
You're all I've got left.

152
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,000
What?

153
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,000
You're all I've got left.

154
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,870
- Don't exaggerate... - No, it's true.

155
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,710
Listen, I'm happy to help you out, but...

156
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,830
I prefer things to be clear, for me this is just for fun.

157
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,870
What do you mean, just for fun?

158
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,910
What happened to me is your fault.

159
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:51,200
Come on, we had fun cuddling for a few minutes.

160
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,590
That doesn't mean I have to turn my flat into a YMCA.

161
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,350
Take care of me.

162
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,430
Take care of me.

163
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,140
Blow jobby?

164
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,860
What?

165
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,600
Blow jobby?

166
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,460
No, no blow jobby now...

167
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,940
Blow jobby! Honestly what a word, blow jobby?

168
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,140
If you want, I'll swallow.

169
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,400
Where am I... I don't know anymore...

170
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:24,940
Right, I'm going to stop this, I've lost track...

171
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,780
Thanks... thanks a lot.

172
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,500
Come here.

173
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,320
No! Wait, just come here, like this.

174
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,000
Time to sleep,OK? - Yes.

175
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,620
Be a good boy.

176
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,380
Are there lessons on Saturday?

177
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,640
It's so the kids don't forget their origins.

178
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,540
One of my mom's great ideas.

179
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,180
Can you wait here, please. I won't be long.

180
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,690
What are you doing?

181
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,820
- Getting attached to you. - You prick.

182
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,060
We should play music together one of these days.

183
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,820
Yeah, if you like.

184
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,460
Bass and piano isn't great.

185
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,240
Can't you play another instrument?

186
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,600
I can play flute.

187
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,040
Idiot.

188
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,940
- No, honestly, it's true. - Yeah, right.

189
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,520
And singing? Can you sing?

190
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:59,690
<i>I'm flying off to the sun, towards days full of fun,</i>

191
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,400
<i>I'm flying off to the sun, to give you advice second to none.</i>

192
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,490
OK, so you can't sing.

193
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,090
No, stop, please... It tickles.

194
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,450
Let go.

195
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:30,930
Do you love me?

196
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,570
Not at all.

197
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,570
Go for it.

198
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,770
Don't forget, my eyes are closed.

199
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,500
I can't take it anymore, I'm on the edge, here.

200
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,890
- You've never taught anyone, have you? - For fucks sake.

201
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,490
- I'm not the worst. - I can't believe you!

202
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,970
I like you a lot, but you really exhaust me.

203
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Wait...

204
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,450
- Look! - Fuck.

205
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,630
What now?

206
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,330
- I'll buy you one. - Well, hurry up.

207
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,290
Get a move on.

208
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,450
Shit, bollocks...

209
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,670
- Get up, for fuck's sake. - Sorry. I'm sorry.

210
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,570
Thank you. Thank you, madam.

211
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,460
Wait... are there any left?

212
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,250
Come on. Let's go. Don't touch me, not here.

213
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,440
Let me know when I'm allowed to touch you.

214
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,040
Don't make a scene. This is my neighbourhood.

215
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,550
everyone knows me, so get off my back!

216
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,610
I wasn't on your back, I just needed your arm to get up!

217
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,250
Don't they have any rubbers here?

218
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,430
Don't know.

219
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,010
- Do you know if they sell condoms? - What are you doing?

220
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,200
It's time we do some ass fucking, I'm sick of playing games.

221
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,500
- We'll see later. - What?

222
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,660
Oh, you're embarrassed. Look at me.

223
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,480
I thought you wanted everything out in the open.

224
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,100
- Miss, do you sell condoms? - She has no idea.

225
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,620
We'd like to spend a nice afternoon together.

226
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,620
Excuse me, could I have your attention please?

227
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,050
- Does anyone know where the rubbers are? - Stop!

228
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,300
Condoms, anywhere here?... No?

229
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,500
They're hard to find...

230
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,180
They didn't all hear me.

231
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,540
Please stop.

232
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,600
Don't touch that, you've made your point.

233
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,640
- One second, I've got to finish. - Put it back!

234
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:57,120
Relax, I'm just embracing my sexuality.

235
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:03,400
Excuse me, can everyone hear me, even over by the cheeses?

236
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,660
I'd like to introduce you to my princess...

237
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,240
who's a bit shy, she's called Mr. Paulo Moiro.

238
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,260
There, now you know him. We are looking for some condoms,

239
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,520
to spend a pleasant afternoon together.

240
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,720
Can anyone help? Because, you see, you can never be too gay.

241
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,660
- Hello - Hello

242
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,550
- Hello - Hello

243
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,500
For the gel, do your prefer pineapple, watermelon.. or natural?

244
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,000
- Is there Kiwi? - Kiwi.

245
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,990
- Do you have Kiwi? - No, none left.

246
00:33:59,440 --> 00:33:59,990
That's a pity.

247
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,000
No Kiwi left.

248
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,880
You decide.

249
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,360
I'll take pineapple, then.

250
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,960
How does it work?

251
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,650
You put your cock through it and then your balls round the back.

252
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,040
- Behind what? - Behind the cuffs and you lock it.

253
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,700
With a little key.

254
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,940
You lock it with a key? What for?

255
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,100
So whoever's wearing it can't open it without the key.

256
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Fucking hell, they're crazy.

257
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:39,950
What?

258
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,000
You're actually into this stuff?

259
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,500
Just the thought makes my balls fizzle.

260
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,840
Fucking crazy... No way.

261
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,000
How can you put your...

262
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,320
We'll take this,

263
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,760
- and this too. - I'll give you a youth price.

264
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,900
Youth price? OK, I see, Here, keep the change.

265
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,120
Goodbye and have a nice day.

266
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,480
- Bye. - Come on.

267
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,240
Are you OK, whats up?

268
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,450
Nothing.

269
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,800
You know the rules, right? Ready...

270
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,160
Hands behind your back.

271
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,550
- Ready? - Yes.

272
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,520
I am, I'm ready.

273
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,580
two, three...

274
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,380
Oh fuck, breathe...

275
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,620
- Are you going for it? - Breathe... Yeah, totally.

276
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,040
No way, take your hand away.

277
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,760
You're cheating.

278
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,000
You cheated...

279
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,880
I lost.

280
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,840
No, do it for real now.

281
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,640
- Oh, you want to do it again? - Without cheating.

282
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,080
But I'd lost, you had your chance, young man.

283
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,640
Your hand.

284
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,600
Here you go.

285
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,040
The pineapple is overpowering.

286
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,080
I'm going to need three weeks to get over this.

287
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,080
Do you want to keep it as a souvenir?

288
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,120
No.

289
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Shame.

290
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,700
- Are you sure? - Yes.

291
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,920
Here, catch.

292
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,560
Be careful! Behind you!

293
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,600
- I've been waiting ages. - I was getting you a present.

294
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,720
Little piglets.

295
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,220
Thanks.

296
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,600
You've missed your train now.

297
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,200
I'll just take the next one, no big deal.

298
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,480
Hold on to this, I'll show you.

299
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,420
Careful.

300
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,640
You'll be mine for the whole weekend.

301
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,560
- No no. - Yes yes.

302
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,800
- No no. - Yes yes.

303
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,400
Follow me.

304
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,880
Come on.

305
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,900
It's fine, you are allowed in here.

306
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,840
You're hurting me.

307
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,000
You're too hard.

308
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,500
It won't work if you're this hard.

309
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
I can't, I can't.

310
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,200
I don't know.

311
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,000
Think about your ex-girlfriend.

312
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,240
There.

313
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,280
Now you'll be happy, you're mine now.

314
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,320
You're mine.

315
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,840
Say it.

316
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,360
Stop, stop.

317
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,440
Say it: I'm yours.

318
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm yours.

319
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,280
Come on, say it. I want to hear it.

320
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,200
Say. I'm yours.

321
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,000
Say I own you.

322
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,400
- Are you mine? - Yes.

323
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,990
- Only mine? - Yes.

324
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,520
Yes, only yours.

325
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,520
Only mine, only mine... Say it. Louder.

326
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,120
I'm only yours, only yours.

327
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,120
- Forever? - Yes.

328
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,900
Forever, I'm only yours forever.

329
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,000
Articulate.

330
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,500
I'm only yours forever.

331
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,500
I'm only yours forever.

332
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,440
I'm only yours forever.

333
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,000
Are you OK?

334
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,920
- No, no, no - give   ...

335
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,700
No way.

336
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,600
- two days is too long, give - Come on, only two days

337
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
There, speaking of keys.

338
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,280
I'll give you these.

339
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,720
Can I... can I help you?

340
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,200
I've...no...

341
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,100
Maybe you could help. It's complicated.

342
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Yeah, seems s... what's up?

343
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,120
I've got this and I don't know what to do with it.

344
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,360
Thank you.

345
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,000
Where is he now?

346
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,240
Second door on the left.

347
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,480
It's for Ilir Loshi.

348
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,440
May I sit here?

349
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,460
You stole my sweater.

350
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,060
- Let me give it back. - No, it's OK. You're not allowed.

351
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,260
- I want to give it to you. - You can't.

352
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,580
It has to be in a package. Security measures.

353
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,600
Fuck!

354
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,320
Are you OK?

355
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,400
I guess.

356
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,540
You never even told me how long you were in for.

357
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,360
Eighteen months.

358
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,600
If things go well, I'll be out in a year they said.

359
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,840
A year? Congratulations!

360
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,160
Are you fucked up in here?

361
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,580
You think I did it on purpose?

362
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,400
300 of us on that train, and they went for me.

363
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,140
You've got hash smoker written all over your face.

364
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,480
You're a moron!

365
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,000
Crossing the border with hash on you, you fucking idiot!

366
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,860
Is that why you came, to lecture me?

367
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,020
There's more to it, so I want to know.

368
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,120
I fought back a little.

369
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,880
Thats good, there you go.

370
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,060
Assault and battery of a Police Officer.

371
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,840
Great!

372
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,560
What do we do now?

373
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,380
What are we going to do?

374
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,840
Wait, I mean you're OK aren't you?

375
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,520
I've got one bit of good news.

376
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,720
I've got a real six-pack.

377
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,560
You want to see? Look.

378
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,580
Three weeks intensive training.

379
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,340
Just imagine.

380
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,340
I must be dreaming,

381
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,560
What is it?

382
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,080
Is that all you can find to tell me?

383
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,000
Fuck, what do you want me to say?

384
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,660
Time.

385
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,320
Don't give up on me, OK?

386
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,120
How can I help you?

387
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,040
Maybe bring me some clothes.

388
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,300
Maybe you can lend me some money?

389
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,720
Why do you need money in prison?

390
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,200
Don't offer to help if you don't want to.

391
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,560
But I do.

392
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,940
I want to help, yes.

393
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,600
Everything costs s bomb in here, toothpaste, food,

394
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,280
The price of cigarettes is ridiculous.

395
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,200
Might help you to stop smoking.

396
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,040
I think they have a bank transfer system.

397
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,000
You could look into it, no?

398
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,060
Hello.

399
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,460
I've come to get some music sheets, I left up here.

400
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,120
I threw everything out.

401
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,460
Sorry.

402
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,000
Never mind.

403
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,600
What's the link...

404
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,540
between a bungee jumper and a faggot?

405
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,520
I don't know.

406
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,920
- Have a guess. - I don't know.

407
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,500
I give up.

408
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,040
If the elastic snaps. they're both up shit creek.

409
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,580
That's crap and disgusting!

410
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,620
Fuck, that's bad.

411
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,460
Wait, I've got a better one,

412
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,460
Two dogs on a walk in Berlin,

413
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,560
one of them lifts his leg

414
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,560
and goes like this,

415
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,280
and the other one also starts peeing...

416
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,640
The first looks straight ahead, not realizing they're both there...

417
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,200
and starts peeing in the other direction,

418
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,640
and the first dog...

419
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,760
is still peeing like that.

420
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,720
He turns round and says

421
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,300
wasn't there a wall here before?

422
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,360
In Berlin...

423
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,220
that's so bad.

424
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:56,000
I've got to tell you something too.

425
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:56,940
OK.

426
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:06,900
This isn't easy to say, so hear me out.

427
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,560
Go for it, I'm listening.

428
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
You've got to stop coming.

429
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,500
It's going to fuck us up.

430
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,680
It's a skewed picture of reality here.

431
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,200
But when we meet here it's good...

432
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,080
It hurts me more than anything.

433
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,120
Thirty minutes, for fuck's sake.

434
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,960
Thirty minutes in a week is...

435
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,700
What's the use?

436
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
It's still good, isn't it?

437
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,360
Listen, I know what I'm saying.

438
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,360
OK?

439
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,380
You've got to stop coming because... I've got my reasons,

440
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,380
everyone will be happier that way, especially you. Believe me.

441
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,560
How can you know that?

442
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,120
You make me weak.

443
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,680
As soon as I see you I go...

444
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,720
It weakens me.

445
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,160
I've got to protect myself.

446
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,940
Do it for me.

447
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,300
No.

448
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,300
Not for you, not for anyone, not for me.

449
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,300
I;m staying here, period!

450
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,440
I'm sorry.

451
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,560
I'm doing this for us.

452
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,400
- No - Stop... stop.

453
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,160
Stop, it's finished now.

454
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,300
You bastard!

455
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,260
- Stop it! - You have no right!

456
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,080
You fucking bastard!

457
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,280
Get him out of here!

458
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,800
Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!

459
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,020
- You want to start with that. - OK.

460
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Your go.

461
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,120
Bring your knees together a bit.

462
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,280
Your back.

463
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,280
So...

464
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,560
Three, four, three...

465
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,840
again, three four...

466
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,300
Ilir!

467
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,420
Ilir!

468
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,780
Ilir!

469
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,540
Ilir!

470
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,960
Keep going.

471
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,640
Are you sure?

472
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,960
Are you sure?

473
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,080
Yes, I'm sure.

474
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,820
Lets look after this.

475
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,720
- Answer. - No.

476
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,760
Come on.

477
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,760
No, its fine.

478
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:03,940
Hello?

479
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,060
Hello?

480
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:07,660
Excuse me.

481
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,300
Wait, hello?

482
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,300
It's me, can you hear me?

483
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,060
Where are you?

484
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,320
I need your help.

485
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,440
Alright?

486
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,000
What's wrong with you?

487
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,000
Nothing, I...

488
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,000
a touch of flu, that's all.

489
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,000
Here, what have you got?

490
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,740
It's from a food tin,

491
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,740
with the lid.

492
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,020
Listen, I'm in a spot of bother...

493
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,910
If you could...

494
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,560
If you could bring me some stash.

495
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,360
Like what?

496
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,560
You know exactly what.

497
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,200
No...no.

498
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,200
Come on, please.

499
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,380
I'll send you money, that's no problem.

500
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,680
That's pointless.

501
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,680
It's real currency in here.

502
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,000
What do I do if I get caught?

503
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,580
Like you're going to get caught?

504
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,500
with your angel face.

505
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,080
No, no and no.

506
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,680
Forget it.

507
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,500
Thanks for coming then.

508
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,420
OK, it's all here.

509
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,000
- Do you want some help? - No.

510
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,840
Well, I hope he's worth it.

511
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,840
He's never asked me for anything,

512
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,100
so now I can help him, I'm doing it.

513
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,900
A 300 euro hash deal, love is beautiful.

514
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,000
- I thought you weren't jealous. - I'm not,

515
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,660
I'm worried, that's all.

516
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,200
It's alright, I know what I'm doing.

517
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,000
Well, if you get into trouble, don't come crying here.

518
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,400
- I hope that's clear. - Yes.

519
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,920
The 1:30 visit, ladies and gentlemen.

520
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:41,540
Hello.

521
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,960
Please close the door behind you.

522
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,480
Visiting rooms open.

523
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,880
- My side is fine. - Mine too.

524
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,520
Go for it.

525
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,620
They need to be smaller.

526
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,400
- Sorry. - Keep going, give me the rest.

527
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:45,860
Wait.

528
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,100
Wait, one second.

529
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,100
How's your family?

530
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,520
They're well, they're happy...

531
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,300
- What are they up to? - On holiday.

532
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,400
- That's nice. - To the country.

533
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,700
The country, that's good.

534
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,400
No, not yet.

535
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,600
They're well, really well.

536
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,760
- We could go to the country - That would be good.

537
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,600
We're clear.

538
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,800
Go for it.

539
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Wait!

540
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Sorry, Sorry...

541
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,160
Stop... stop, stop.

542
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,100
Spit it out.

543
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,400
Fuck!

544
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:44,860
Shit!

545
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,750
Thank Christ.

546
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,760
Where the fuck were you?

547
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,400
Where were you?

548
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,400
Tell me.

549
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,600
Tell me, for fuck's sake!

550
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800
Answer me.

551
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,400
Let go of me.

552
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,250
This is still my home.

553
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,440
Stay there!

554
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,620
Explain it to me.

555
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,120
Did they catch you?

556
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I fucked things up for him.

557
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,520
I fucked things up for him.

558
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,300
It's not your fault.

559
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,600
You can't save him.

560
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,180
You've got to stop suffering like this.

561
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,180
I'm useless, I'm useless, I'm useless!

562
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,600
Let me take care of you.

563
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,260
- Good luck. - Thank you.

564
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:08,000
I leave you alone for a bit, and look where you end up.

565
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,700
How are you?

566
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And you?

567
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,220
I'm OK.

568
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,200
You could say hello to me.

569
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:38,880
Hello.

570
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:51,380
You know what they gave me when I was released?

571
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,720
Look.

572
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
It's too late now.

573
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,500
I hope so, for you.

574
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:09,100
I gave all your stuff to your sister.

575
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,220
Yeah, she told me.

576
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:14,660
Thanks.

577
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,380
Do you need some help?

578
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:35,200
Listen, I finish in two hours, we could meet up in a bar.

579
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,850
I don't want us to talk here.

580
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:41,850
OK.

581
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,940
- See you in a bit. - Yes.

582
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,300
Do you want some sugar?

583
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,700
Yeah, cheers.

584
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,000
You've become all grown up.

585
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,500
No, it's just that I made some choices.

586
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,050
Do you really find sexy boy better than me?

587
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,200
No, you are definitely better looking.

588
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,400
So?

589
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,100
So what?... so...

590
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,350
It's complicated.

591
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,700
Where are you crashing?

592
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,700
With my sister.

593
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,000
And are you sure you know where to sleep?

594
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,050
No, I'm not really sure.

595
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,200
I'm not sure about anything.

596
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,400
You know what, let's celebrate.

597
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,500
Forget about everything, celebrate and start from scratch, OK?

598
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,500
I don't know.

599
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,900
Oh come on, please, don't say no.

600
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,200
Should we go for a walk?

601
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,200
Cool.

602
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,000
Come on.

603
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,500
We'd like a room.

604
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,500
- For two? - Yes.

605
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,000
Twin beds?

606
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,900
- Does it look like we're together? - Oh yes, yes. I'm sorry.

607
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
We've got some luxury rooms at 340 euro.

608
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,200
- Nothing smaller? - No, that's fine.

609
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,500
I'll pay now.

610
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,800
- This is ridiculous, we'll share. - No, it's OK.

611
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,200
Hard to get it out. Here.

612
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,050
Do you want to come upstairs with us?

613
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,000
I don't even make you hard anymore, do I?

614
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:10,750
What's this?

615
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,350
- Nothing. - What?

616
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,650
It's nothing I said, too much playing.

617
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:36,750
Stop.

618
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:38,750
Stop, stop!

619
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,350
Stop it!

620
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,800
We're here all night, so...

621
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,300
Oh fuck.

622
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,800
It feels like I'm still in a cell.

623
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,000
And on top of it I picked up something nasty.

624
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:16,650
What?

625
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:21,550
Syphilis.

626
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:27,000
It's not the end of the world, just a pain.

627
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:30,700
But it's OK.

628
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,700
- But did you... - I didn't have a choice,

629
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,700
you had a choice.

630
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,200
What do you know? I did what I could, like you.

631
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:42,200
Like you.

632
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,220
If you say so.

633
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,220
Just like me.

634
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,270
In that case, bottoms up.

635
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:31,700
What are you doing?

636
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,400
- I'm leaving. Wait...

637
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:39,250
you can't leave like that, wait a couple of minutes.

638
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,600
I have to be somewhere.

639
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:46,900
I forgot, you're over-booked now you've become a winner.

640
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,900
If you say so.

641
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:50,200
Wait!

642
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,650
You know what, I...

643
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,050
I don't even have a photo of you.

644
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,550
It's not as if we're not going to see each other again.

645
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:15,290
One photo.

646
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,400
OK?

647
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:27,090
Are you ready?

648
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,500
No, wait wait.

649
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,800
This isn't us, is it?

650
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,100
We have to be happy.

651
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:53,900
OK?

652
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,700
Right!

653
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,590
- You've got to smile, OK? - Yes.

654
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:22,990
One... two...

655
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:29,400
and three.
