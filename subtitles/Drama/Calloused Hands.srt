1
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,240
Did you blow
the candles out downstairs?

2
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,922
Yeah.

3
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,321
Look at this.

4
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,849
A Thanksgiving cornucopia
made of pie plates and spackle.

5
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,042
What the heck is a cornucopia?

6
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,169
It's like a horn of plenty.

7
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,765
Oh, dear, can't it wait'?

8
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,440
We just finished decorating
for Halloween.

9
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,328
- Well, good night.
- Night.

10
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,080
Go look!

11
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,051
Just a prank, that's all. Anton.

12
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,364
Our little Scooter would
never do something like that.

13
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,444
Quit calling him that baby name.

14
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,884
Anton would not scoot his behind
off the couch if the house was on fire.

15
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,527
God knows he didn't help me
with the Halloween decorations.

16
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,328
Did you hear that?
I heard something downstairs.

17
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,802
Well, the dog's out in the yard.

18
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,441
It's probably just the cat.

19
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,291
Well, go see!

20
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,529
Hey, Bones.

21
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,726
Gary?

22
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,405
Anton?

23
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,603
Gary, you said you--

24
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,882
The house could burn down!

25
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,528
Wake up!

26
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,966
Anton, is that you'?

27
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,364
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
hang up and try again.</i>

28
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,406
<i>If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.</i>

29
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,281
Hey, Mom! We're out of milk!

30
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,611
Mom, we're out of dog food!

31
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,929
<i>Murder in Bolan: A Special Report.</i>

32
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,403
<i>Four bodies have been found.
The killer is still at large.</i>

33
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,331
<i>Bolan is gripped with fear.</i>

34
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,767
<i>The killings spread
from a postal route...</i>

35
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,248
<i>...to the bowling alley and
now to our own Burger Jungle.</i>

36
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,363
<i>With Halloween only one day away...</i>

37
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,167
<i>...Bolan officials have set
a 9 p.m. curfew for all teenagers.</i>

38
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,320
Hey. What's up, man?

39
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,568
<i>- What's up with you?
- I'm dry.</i>

40
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,883
- So?
- So why don't you bring me a dimer'?

41
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,209
<i>This ain't Domino's, you lazy bitch.
Come over and get it.</i>

42
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,647
Come on, man. I'm comfortable.

43
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,521
<i>Hello'?</i>

44
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,129
What's up, Anton?

45
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,209
Nice outfit!

46
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,563
Yeah? If your mom had teeth,
she wouldn't suck dick so well.

47
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,091
What's your point'?

48
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,041
What's up, Anton?

49
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,525
How's it going, brother?

50
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,524
Nice boxers.

51
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,405
Pass the chronic.

52
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,087
I'm sorry, man.
This bong is cashed.

53
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,322
You said he was holding.

54
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,081
I didn't say what I was holding.

55
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,602
That's messed up.

56
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,885
I hear if you combine nutmeg and
oregano, you can get pretty wasted.

57
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,010
All you do is smoke pot...

58
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,531
...and watch TV all day.

59
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,525
Don't get me wrong.
That's what life is all about.

60
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,923
But don't you think you should
have some ambition, a goal?

61
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,284
Yeah. l mean,
my dream life would be...

62
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,204
...to lie around and watch TV
while some hot broad delivers me food.

63
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,047
Until your parents
kick your oily ass out.

64
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,602
I haven't seen my parents
in a few days.

65
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,440
Maybe they're dead.
Party at Anton's.

66
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,926
What are you doing?

67
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,771
With a killer loose,
you can't rule out murder.

68
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,001
What killer'?

69
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,691
Don't you watch the news?

70
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,525
I hate that fucking show.

71
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,280
Our little town is
in the national spotlight.

72
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,010
Local mailman, iced.

73
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,607
Barmaid at the bowling alley, iced.

74
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,569
You haven't heard about the twins?

75
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,680
They were jerking off
in the milkshake-maker again?

76
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,010
Iced times two. Last night, when
they were working at Burger Jungle.

77
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,891
Damn.

78
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,204
Anton, here comes your woman.

79
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,002
He's got serious problems.

80
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,568
Molly's lived across the street
for, like, what, ever'?

81
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,127
Tell her about your
obsession with her.

82
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,126
- Start by telling her your name.
- Yeah, man. She's waiting for you.

83
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,885
She's not waiting for me.

84
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,966
Would you stop being such a puss
and go, like, ask her to the dance'?

85
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,321
What dance'?

86
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,126
If you'd been to school recently,
you'd know.

87
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,964
Halloween thing in the gym?

88
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,640
9:00 curfew?
No trick-or-treating allowed?

89
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,962
Dumb-ass dance is the only option.

90
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,127
You guys 9°in97

91
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,170
Hell, no. Can you see us
in stupid-ass costumes?

92
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,845
Grooving to Hanson and Jewel'?

93
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,526
What do we look like,
total losers, man?

94
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,650
I see your point.

95
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,731
She dropped her lyrics book.

96
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,288
She'll catch you reading that
over her shoulder in biology.

97
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,364
Her songs are bad-ass.
She's like a poet or something.

98
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,845
Go bring it back to her.
Be like a knight in shining armour.

99
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,085
She'd be all grateful, invite me in,
offer me a drink, I'd accept.

100
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,805
She'd rip your clothes off...

101
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,930
...and make sweet love to you,
Red Shoe Diary-style.

102
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,328
- Right.
- Could happen.

103
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,928
Just go talk to her, man!

104
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,131
Maybe she'll think you're funny
or something.

105
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,126
You know what?

106
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,926
I think I'm going to.

107
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,328
You want to borrow some pants, chief?

108
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,251
First impressions and all.

109
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,687
You're a bud.

110
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,165
Think he's gonna do it'?

111
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,246
So you gotta reach.

112
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,122
You're getting Cheezy Poofs everywhere.

113
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,322
You gotta open your mouth, man.

114
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,490
Lookie what I found.

115
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,121
I thought you were dry.

116
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,282
I guess not.

117
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,921
Fire me up.

118
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,690
These are great.

119
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,290
My book!

120
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,366
Thank you so much...

121
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,291
...for returning it.

122
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,561
You're certain this is the right man?

123
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,451
Well, I'll tell you,
Sister Liquor--

124
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,884
That's LeCure.

125
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,170
- Debt's fine.
- All right, Sister Debi.

126
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,084
He's right here.

127
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,006
He's gone!

128
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,841
Shit!

129
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,010
Missed it again.

130
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,845
Where did it go'?

131
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,285
Beaver.

132
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,645
Bolan.

133
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,810
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

134
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,645
Holy shit!

135
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,761
Don't move!

136
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,446
Roll over!

137
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,126
Roll over!

138
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,721
Anton Tobias.

139
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,807
You got a reason
for prowling around here'?

140
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,927
I live here.

141
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,401
Since when is it illegal
to grocery shop?

142
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,364
Hey, I know you guys.

143
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,930
You guys were seniors
when I was a freshman.

144
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,884
Let's talk about high school.

145
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,084
You and your stoner friends
zipping around on skateboards.

146
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,970
Thought you were too cool for us.

147
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,489
Did you even once invite us
to get high behind the gym?

148
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,281
You were dorks.

149
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,091
Either of you holding?

150
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,327
<i>What'?</i>

151
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,490
I'm desperate. I know you can
get in the evidence room--

152
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,082
You asshole!
You're trying to score from a cop'?

153
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,449
That's it.
Complete personal-effects search.

154
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,007
What's this'?

155
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,607
Stupid, that's an asthma inhaler.

156
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,845
Empty your pockets, boy.

157
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,161
They're not my pants.

158
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,487
Let's go!

159
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,325
George found a new home.

160
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,290
What have we here'?

161
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,246
Officer'?

162
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,643
Smells like marijuana to me.

163
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,847
Write it up, Ruck.

164
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,201
What? It's empty.

165
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,246
You can't cite me
for possession of a baggie.

166
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,451
Littering.

167
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,284
Maximum fine.

168
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,969
Two hundred dollars.

169
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,801
Right.

170
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,322
Oh, shit! The killer's here!

171
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,724
The killer's in my house!

172
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,926
Okay, Du key.

173
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,924
Everything's gonna be okay.
Come on, come on.

174
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,888
Everything's going to be fine.

175
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,730
Yes, it is.

176
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,365
All right, boy.

177
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,685
He's not dead!

178
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,283
Duke! Come on, lay down!

179
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,646
Get down, Duke!

180
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,606
All right.

181
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,808
Hold on, Duke. Hold on.

182
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,328
Where's the phone'?

183
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,845
Run, Duke, run!

184
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,042
He's under the bed!

185
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,281
Mom?

186
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,607
Dad?

187
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,370
What's the matter?
Bad shrooms'?

188
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,847
You got a fever'? Here you go.

189
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,885
I'm going to show you.

190
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,530
Oh, man!

191
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,682
I love this video. I didn't think
they could show it anymore.

192
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,722
Guys!

193
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,045
Someone killed my parents!

194
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,406
This is the best part.

195
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,246
Shake them, baby.

196
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,682
Look! Look!

197
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,925
- Shit!
- Yeah, you see'?

198
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,761
Mr. Tobias?

199
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,081
Miss T.'?

200
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,964
Is this some kind of Halloween gag?
Your parents always go all out.

201
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,685
What the fuck are you doing?
That's my dad!

202
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,685
CPR, man. I saw it on Baywatch.

203
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,731
Check it out.

204
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,725
A clue.

205
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,961
"Ant"? They were killed by ants?

206
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,083
Please, don't be stupid.

207
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,845
Do you have an evil aunt?

208
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,726
Holy shit!

209
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,127
Are those ears'?

210
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,240
Earrings?

211
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,761
They're both lefts.

212
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,210
You know what that means.

213
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,964
Feldstein twins.

214
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,282
The killer was wearing your shirt.

215
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,124
The killer was wearing me.

216
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,651
I'm the killer.

217
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,046
I'm gonna call 911.

218
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,160
What's the number'?

219
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,282
There's something wrong
with my friend.

220
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,086
I think he took
some nutmeg or something.

221
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,644
Mick, buddy.

222
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,931
- I would remember something like that.
- You would.

223
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,004
I'm not the killer. You know'?

224
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,801
Yeah, I know. But if O.J.
could get off, then I'm sure--

225
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,691
Do you want a beer'?

226
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,251
- No, thanks.
- You sure'?

227
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,400
Talk to me!

228
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,128
What the hell is happening to me'?

229
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,286
Pnub, man.

230
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,525
I didn't do it.

231
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,284
Okay, I did it.
But it was an accident.

232
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,721
I can't believe
you told me to smoke that shit!

233
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,687
Okay, Anton.
I have to leave now.

234
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,322
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

235
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,206
It's the basement!
You can't get out that way!

236
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,170
Why are you doing this?

237
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,646
I don't know!

238
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,045
It's me, Pnub! Your buddy!

239
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,886
I know who you are.
I don't want to hurt you.

240
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,167
Then don't!

241
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,966
It's not me!

242
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,361
It's my hand!

243
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,921
It's like I have no control
over my hand!

244
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,167
I don't know how long
I can hold it. Run!

245
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,521
Get out of my way!

246
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,568
Just go!

247
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,291
It's going to be okay.
I won't tell anybody.

248
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,641
I swear.

249
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,491
Everything will be cool.

250
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,721
Everything will be...

251
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,570
...cool.

252
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,805
What have I done'?

253
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,204
What have I done'?

254
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,044
Get out of here, Bones!

255
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,726
Git!

256
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,881
Bones?

257
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,725
Here, kitty, kitty.

258
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,562
Aren't you a little old
for ding-dong ditch?

259
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,809
Sorry about your bush.

260
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,530
No problem.

261
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,327
What were you doing out there anyway?

262
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,607
Jesus, look at you!

263
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,124
I was looking for my cat.

264
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,600
We got in a fight.

265
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,124
You sure got your ass kicked.

266
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,284
I did okay.

267
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,249
So you ran and hid in my bush.

268
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,530
I shouldn't be here.

269
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,570
I'm not myself today.

270
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,329
I'm someone completely different.

271
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,084
You're so shy.

272
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,446
It's okay. I get it.

273
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,123
So let's skip this chickening-out,
sneaking-around stage.

274
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,284
No, you don't understand. I'm--

275
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,007
Do you want to come inside and talk'?

276
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,886
You never gave me a chance to thank you.
That book is important to me.

277
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,606
So...

278
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,369
...nothing cooler than
a chick bass-guitar player.

279
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,602
Especially one that writes
her own lyrics.

280
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,330
You read them?

281
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,163
I couldn't help looking in the book.
They're amazing.

282
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,971
Look, I even got
my favourites memorized.

283
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,884
<i>Devil girl with nothing to lose</i>

284
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,330
<i>She got wind in her hair
And gum on her shoes</i>

285
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,124
I was 13 when I wrote that.

286
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,725
Yeah, well...

287
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,367
...they're amazing.

288
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,886
Thanks.

289
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,287
I should not be here, Molly.

290
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,241
Safer in here than on the streets.
There's a killer out there.

291
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,487
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I'm dangerous.

292
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,961
0h, yeah?

293
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,089
How dangerous?

294
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,161
I'm not kidding.

295
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,243
I've done stuff, you know'?

296
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,484
I'm impressed.

297
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,691
I never would've thought you'd have
the balls to just grab me like that.

298
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,440
Me either.

299
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,690
You're kinky.

300
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,531
That's me.

301
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,081
Move it, people! Let's go!

302
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,322
Some of us are
on serious missions here.

303
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,522
<i>There's evil out there,
and I gotta kick its ass!</i>

304
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,760
Shit, my parents are home.
We'll have to pick this up later.

305
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,487
My parents might take offense to some
bloody boy banging their daughter.

306
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,806
Tomorrow.

307
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,328
- You want to see me'?
- Come by at 7.

308
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,924
The curfew's annihilated our options,
but we can go to the dance.

309
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,801
I thought you said
the streets weren't safe.

310
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,201
I'll protect you.

311
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,091
Dearly beloved...

312
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,130
...we're gathered here today
because you're all dead.

313
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,570
And it's my fault.

314
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,683
Mom, Dad...

315
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,762
...what can I say'? I mean...

316
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,288
...you brought me into this world...

317
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,286
...you put a roof over my head,
you fed me until I killed you.

318
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,284
If you look at it that way, I haven't
been a good son, but I'm really...

319
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,602
...really, really sorry.

320
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,723
And wherever you are...

321
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,644
...I just want you to forgive me...

322
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,168
...because I'm gonna try to change.

323
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,681
Mick...

324
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,285
...Pnub, guys...

325
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,127
You guys were the greatest.
I'm never going to forget...

326
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,247
...the way we sat around all day,
watched TV and got really stoned.

327
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,927
And all those other times
where we just...

328
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,802
I guess that's all we did.

329
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,086
Amen.

330
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,324
Over here.

331
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,405
Anton, help me.

332
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,923
Come on, man.
I can't breathe down here.

333
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,642
Anton, can you hear me'?

334
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,161
Yeah, man, Mick.

335
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,368
Now get me out of here.

336
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,681
You're dead.

337
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,688
No, I'm not.

338
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,521
You conked my head pretty good.
I must have been unconscious.

339
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,205
- You think?
- I know, fucker. Now dig me up!

340
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,610
Stay where you are, Mick!

341
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,766
Please don't kill me.

342
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,647
Watch it, man!

343
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,043
What did I take last night?

344
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,288
That dream was intense.

345
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,605
Intense.

346
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,686
- Turn it up. Check it out.
- Yeah, I'm watching.

347
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,842
<i>Did you see'?</i>

348
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,206
- Guys!
- That's funny.

349
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,001
Thank God you're alive, because
I had this dream that I killed--

350
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,806
Shit!

351
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,009
Sorry about that thing
with the shovel.

352
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,569
- You're dead.
- Easy, tiger.

353
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,684
Undead, actually.

354
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,048
You said you were unconscious.
You lied.

355
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,841
You killed me, all right'?
Try and keep this thing in perspective.

356
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,050
I was bitter about the
getting-killed-by-my-best-friend thing.

357
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,685
But I got over it.

358
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,691
So why you here'?

359
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,291
We need a place to kick it.

360
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,205
Don't be selfish.
No one else parents are dead.

361
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,001
No, not why are you "here" here.
I mean...

362
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,801
...are you flesh-eating zombies
back from hell to exact revenge?

363
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,366
Is that it'?

364
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,563
Why would we go to hell'?

365
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,608
We're not bad.

366
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,242
It's not like we're good,
but at least we don't kill people!

367
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,489
I didn't kill anybody on purpose.

368
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,168
Yeah, well, we weren't in hell.

369
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,324
There was this bright light
at the end of a long tunnel.

370
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,609
There were all these chicks' voices.
And that music.

371
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,722
Music?

372
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,571
Kind of uncool music, like Enya.

373
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,404
And these chicks were saying...

374
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,371
..."Come to us.
Come towards the light."

375
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,291
So what happened?

376
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,090
We figured, fuck it.

377
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,129
I mean, it was really far.

378
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,202
I've got to ask.
What's with the hand?

379
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,484
It doesn't obey me at all.

380
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,889
The only thing I can come up with is,
it's possessed.

381
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,089
Do you guys know anything
about Satan or evil or...'?

382
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,642
No.

383
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,683
But we know somebody who does.

384
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,006
Did you know them well'?

385
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,524
Not really.

386
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,967
You?

387
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,968
Yeah, they were great.

388
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,444
I just feel really bad, you know,
because I was always so mean to them.

389
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,281
Like this one time, they asked me
to go on a double-date...

390
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,127
...and I thought they were 'tarts,
because there's only one of me.

391
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,690
So I told them to go blow each other.

392
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,961
Did they?

393
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,000
The way you treated them...

394
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,846
...the guilt must be making you feel
like shit inside.

395
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,607
Randy!

396
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,604
You're still in high school?

397
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,366
Yeah, me, I got out
about three years ago.

398
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,931
I need your help.

399
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,201
What are you playing,
a little two-ball'?

400
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,163
I gotta talk to you.
There's serious stuff going on.

401
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,882
Anton, can't you see I'm getting
a little action over here'?

402
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,688
Oh, man. I can't believe
you cock-blocked me like that.

403
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,888
I thought we were buds.

404
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,442
Randy, wait!

405
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,368
I didn't mean to mess you up.
Listen.

406
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,170
I need your help.

407
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,280
Piss off!

408
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,203
Fresh tomatoes.

409
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,251
Hey! Who are you'?

410
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,409
New. Drive-thru duty.

411
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,801
Excuse me.

412
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,241
Sorry.

413
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,889
- Break time.
- All right.

414
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,445
Give me the Big Five with
the Spicy Safari Fries...

415
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,682
...the African Apple Turnover...

416
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,843
...and the Raspberry Rainforest Shake.

417
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,560
Slap some extra mustard
on that Jungle Burger.

418
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,007
<i>Tell me everything you know
about the devil.</i>

419
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,643
<i>Are you out of your fucking mind?</i>

420
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,002
You listen to satanic music.
You must've picked up something.

421
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,766
<i>Look, it's just music.</i>

422
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,682
<i>Like Mozart and that other fag...</i>

423
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,361
Keep it clean.

424
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,691
Who, Beethoven'?

425
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,089
<i>That's the guy. It's just like
their music, only louder.</i>

426
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,810
You gotta know.
I'm desperate.

427
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,326
Oh, man!

428
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,841
Here!

429
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,531
Asshole!

430
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,724
It's my hand. It's like it's got
a mind of its own.

431
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,321
It makes me do things
I don't want it to do.

432
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,286
I used to be like that.

433
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,841
Get into all kinds of stupid shit.

434
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,161
Look, the trick is...

435
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,124
...to keep yourself busy.

436
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,567
That's why I'm always
working on the Ford.

437
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,649
Keeps me out of trouble.

438
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,884
Idle hands are the devil's playground.

439
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,129
Keep my hands busy.

440
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,605
Yeah, that actually makes sense.

441
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,120
Thanks.
You're the coolest.

442
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,405
So do you, like, knit now'?

443
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,928
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look queer doing that.

444
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,162
Randy broke it down for me.

445
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,525
"Idle hands are the devil's playpen."
So I'm thinking...

446
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,327
...keep my hands occupied, right'?

447
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,967
Man, that saying's not literal.

448
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,486
It's more like...

449
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,128
...you know...

450
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,926
Metaphorical'?

451
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,566
Right.

452
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,163
This is the noise complaint.

453
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,724
Ain't this the Tobias residence?

454
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,487
Holy shit! It's Anton.
He's the killer!

455
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,961
- I better call for backup.
- Are you crazy?

456
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,682
And let the feds get the credit?
If we collar him, we'll be heroes.

457
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,450
We can't go in without a warrant.

458
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,808
Piss on the Bill of Rights!
We got just cause.

459
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,206
Freeze!

460
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,680
Yeah, freeze!

461
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,368
Guys...

462
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,602
...what do I do'?

463
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,926
I think you--

464
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,321
I was gonna say to do
what they tell you...

465
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,965
...but now I changed my mind.

466
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,770
You should just kill them.

467
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,851
- They're alive!
- They are not!

468
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,168
You shot one in the head!
They're morgue-meat.

469
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,571
Look, guys. I don't want
to kill anybody else.

470
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,288
You don't want to go to jail, though.

471
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,967
Jail. That's it!

472
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,488
They'll throw me in a rubber room.
I can't hurt anybody else.

473
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,006
Cuff me!

474
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,409
Okay. Just...

475
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,730
...drop the knitting needles.

476
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,130
That's not a good idea.
Why don't you just cuff me'?

477
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,490
Drop the needles
and put your hands on your head!

478
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,767
I can't!

479
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,322
Put down the needles
and come quietly.

480
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,881
- Cuff me!
- Put the needles down now!

481
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,764
- Cuff me!
- Put them down!

482
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,405
- Put them down!
- Cuff me!

483
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,847
Go, go, Buffalo!

484
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,286
Stop!

485
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,849
I didn't do it. It was my hand.

486
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,726
It's like, the knitting
didn't help at all.

487
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,850
I told you that saying
was more, like, metaphorical.

488
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,607
I can't keep doing this!

489
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,930
I'm losing my mind.

490
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,570
Get your head.

491
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,284
No way.

492
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,008
It's the only thing I can think of.

493
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,563
Once that hand is gone,
how will you cut off the other one'?

494
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,086
The left one's a keeper.

495
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,527
I mean, I guess it wasn't idle enough.

496
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,201
Are you sure'?

497
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,131
I use it for a lot of things.
I light up, I change the remote...

498
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,642
...I relieve a little tension.

499
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,088
This is the answer. I know it.

500
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,004
Those things won't even cut my bagel.

501
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,001
Shit!

502
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,922
Grab the carver.

503
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,886
Look at me!

504
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,884
I'm Leather-face!

505
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,967
Thanks, Mick.

506
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,009
I'll just use this one.

507
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,725
I can't watch.

508
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,887
You missed.

509
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,927
Pnub...

510
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,047
...bite down.

511
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,686
Don't cut me, man!

512
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,649
You scream like a girl.

513
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,005
What the hell are you doing?

514
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,966
I gotta stop the blood flow.
Don't you watch ER'?

515
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,560
Look at that nasty thing.
That's gonna be infected for sure.

516
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,689
You got any antiseptic, Anton?

517
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,921
I don't know.

518
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,004
Pnub's got some in a first-aid kit
in his house.

519
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,361
And burritos.

520
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,411
You'll be okay, buddy.

521
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,120
We'll be back in a sec
to fix you up, Anton.

522
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,127
Catch you on the flip-flop.

523
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,126
Oh, shit!

524
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,123
Anton, are you home'?

525
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,888
Don't come in!
Just stay there, okay?

526
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,210
Very funny, Anton.

527
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,930
Stay out there, Molly!

528
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,049
I'm freezing my butt off.

529
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,649
Anton, we're gonna be late.

530
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,204
Anton, I can hear you in there!

531
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,090
Stay outside!

532
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,009
Come on, Anton!

533
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,402
Let's go!
We're gonna be late!

534
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,044
We're gonna miss the band.

535
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,126
Fry!

536
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,246
Gross.

537
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,489
Anton, I'm coming in.

538
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,768
Wait!

539
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,011
You look incredible.

540
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,089
Thanks. But you should've called.

541
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,807
If you needed more time with your
costume, fine. But I hate waiting.

542
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,447
So what are you supposed
to be, anyway?

543
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,007
I'm...

544
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,843
...a fast-food employee that
cut off his own hand.

545
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,168
Cute.

546
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,921
Come on!

547
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,250
Anton, we're back!

548
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,004
We got antiseptic
and adhesive bandages!

549
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,929
The ouch-free kind!

550
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,042
"Microwave for three minutes
and enjoy."

551
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,803
That's really getting on my nerves.

552
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,964
What are you doing?

553
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,922
Could you...'?

554
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,281
This way.

555
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,601
<i>EafiY-</i>

556
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,089
Yeah. That's better.

557
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,281
All right.

558
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,680
Thanks, man!

559
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,520
Gross!

560
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,123
Maybe we should clean it first.

561
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,211
Hey, yeah! And while we're at it,
we can clean the whole house.

562
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,970
This ain't our mess.

563
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,526
Look, I can't go to the dance yet,
okay? I'm sorry.

564
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,646
My parents will be home
in a few minutes.

565
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,446
If they see the mess I made,
they'll kill me.

566
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,208
Look, I won't be too long.

567
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,771
I'll meet you there.

568
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,531
Is something wrong?

569
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,404
You need to go there now...

570
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,969
...and you can't stop till you're
inside with everyone else, okay?

571
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,243
You wouldn't stand me up, would you'?

572
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,282
Not a chance, baby-snakes.

573
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,850
I'll get the next one.

574
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,123
Shit! I bit my tongue.

575
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,527
That's disgusting.

576
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,569
I bet I can fix that for you.

577
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,282
Hold still.

578
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,606
That's better.

579
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,163
<i>Burrito, burrito</i>

580
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,607
Wait, wait! Don't open it!

581
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,650
I'm sorry, there were only two.

582
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,167
No! You let the hand out!

583
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,002
We brought you a first-aid kit.

584
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,045
- Where did it go'?
- What'? You mean the hand?

585
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,327
Of course, the hand.

586
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,282
Try looking up your ass.

587
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,326
Damn.

588
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,928
Hey, fOXY-

589
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,287
Looking for a ball'?

590
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,280
Because I could help you find one
that's the right size for you.

591
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,247
What the hell'?

592
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,811
Try and keep up.

593
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,931
I'd be happy to keep up
with you, sweet thing.

594
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,804
Don't you have a dance to go to'?

595
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,966
That's right.
We gotta do our costumes.

596
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,527
- You coming, Randy?
- No.

597
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,649
I think I can find myself a ride.

598
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,086
All right.

599
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,129
So what brings you to Bolan'?

600
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,166
You don't want to know.

601
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,206
No, seriously.
I'm interested.

602
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,561
Really?

603
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,930
Here it goes.

604
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,481
I'm a Druidic priestess sworn
to fight a certain evil force...

605
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,564
...that possesses the laziest
fuck-up it can find.

606
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,326
It will kill as many people
as possible...

607
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,689
...and then drag a free soul
into the Netherworld.

608
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,088
That's some weighty shit there.

609
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,646
Here's the kicker.

610
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,168
I have the one thing
that can stop this from happening.

611
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,004
I just need to find the bastard
whose hand is possessed.

612
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,687
Weird.

613
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,925
Earlier today, this guy, Anton,
told me his hand was doing stuff...

614
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,162
...that he didn't want it to do.

615
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,531
Don't you fuck with me!

616
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,330
Ease up, there, kitten.

617
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,530
I'm telling you the truth.
This guy was freaked!

618
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,564
Show me where he lives.

619
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,361
Left! Turn left!

620
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,445
Guys! We gotta go to the dance.

621
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,091
The hand, it's after Molly.

622
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,087
Let's check out the dance.
I'll win Best Costume.

623
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,290
Chicks dig winners.
I'll probably hook up.

624
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,605
Yeah, because severed heads are
one of the top 10 big turn-ons.

625
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,891
It kills me to see you stressed out.

626
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,209
You cut off your hand
in the interest of others.

627
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,601
It's not your problem anymore.

628
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,641
So what I want you to do
is take a little Anton-time.

629
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,161
Just relax and kick back, my man.

630
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,170
No, no. You know what?

631
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,807
Not this time, okay?

632
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,281
I'm through with that.
All I do is sit around.

633
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,051
I veg out, I watch TV,
I smoke pot--

634
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,766
No Kevin Costner speeches.
Let's just go.

635
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,367
Come on!

636
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,811
Let's go! Come on, come on!

637
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,286
That's him!

638
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,889
- They're getting into my Ford!
- Wait here. He's dangerous.

639
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,886
Wait.
Don't let him steal my Ford.

640
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,884
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

641
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,166
That's lucky.

642
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,281
Shit.

643
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,170
Couldn't be automatic.

644
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:42,888
Want me to drive'?

645
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,360
No, just shift for me.

646
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,764
Anton! Wait!

647
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,241
What was that?

648
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,481
<i>Who cares'?</i>

649
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,325
Get back here!

650
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,568
Who's got the barf breath?

651
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,002
Damn!
It's hot in here.

652
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,565
So are you, babe.

653
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,764
I'm sweating my costume off, Curtis.

654
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,601
Better?

655
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,884
Help me get this off.

656
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,729
Right there.

657
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,441
It's here.

658
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,248
You guys go protect Molly.

659
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,800
I'll go after the hand.

660
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,522
- What a waste.
- You didn't like Curtis.

661
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,484
I'm talking about that ass!

662
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,449
Well, at least he died happy.

663
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,805
What's bugging you'?

664
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,405
Just thinking.

665
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,645
And I know who about.

666
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,849
Just thought he'd be here by now.

667
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,205
He'll be here.

668
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,006
I'll go get some punch.
You want some'?

669
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,330
Okay, I'll be right back.

670
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,883
You guys look great!

671
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,290
Who did your makeup?

672
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,843
- I guess Anton did.
- Based on my design, though.

673
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,727
You want to dance'?

674
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,922
Hell, yeah!

675
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,962
- We should find Molly.
- Quit being a skirt.

676
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,562
We'll look for her while we dance.
There's plenty of chicks here.

677
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,561
- Careful, it's on kind of loose.
- Cool!

678
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:53,162
Don't put me on hold again.
I want to talk to your supervisor.

679
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,561
<i>What'?</i>

680
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,124
Yes, of course.

681
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,324
What's taking so long?
Is this the supervisor'?

682
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,966
What do you mean
my credit card is no good?

683
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,801
Well, you must have
the wrong number.

684
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,251
No, it's 8-4-6-8.

685
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,246
That's good.

686
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,006
I think you've been a bad girl...

687
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,242
...and I want to spank you
with my ruler.

688
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,690
Oh, yes, that's nice.

689
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,320
That is nice.

690
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,040
Now I'm hot.

691
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,051
I'm hot.

692
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,808
You got me so hot, it's like
I can feel you touching me.

693
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,968
I can feel you touching me.

694
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,847
Bingo!

695
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,527
Come on! We got to find Anton!

696
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,364
And kick his ass!

697
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,885
Are you Anton?

698
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,885
If you're a teacher,
we'll discuss my attendance later--

699
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,048
I found you!
My name is Debi LeCure.

700
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,567
I know what's happening.
I could stop it.

701
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,282
Really, how'?

702
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,448
Die!

703
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,286
Yeah, fuck him up, Debi!

704
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,729
The host of evil must die!

705
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,842
Isn't that knife
a little extreme, kitten'?

706
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,408
You're not going anywhere, evil-hosting
fuck-stick. Nobody touches my Ford!

707
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,648
<i>Come on, Debt.</i>

708
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,802
Give him what for.

709
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,525
Wait, wait! I'm not a host.

710
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,966
Okay, look.

711
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,242
The evil was in my hand, all right'?

712
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,884
I cut it off. Okay?

713
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,562
Oh, shit!

714
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,046
You let it loose?

715
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,009
That was probably a mistake.

716
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:10,244
No kidding. And now it's
after my girlfriend.

717
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,204
- You got a girlfriend'?
- I gotta stop it.

718
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,171
-It's out for blood.
- That ain't all it's out for.

719
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,210
If your girl's the one it's after,
then at midnight...

720
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,090
...it's taking her to hell.

721
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,765
Hell?

722
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,726
It's not even 9:00 yet.
We got some time.

723
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,768
It's actually...

724
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,890
...six minutes till midnight,
druid time.

725
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,125
Druid time.

726
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,282
Right.

727
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,288
Let's go!

728
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,761
Oh, God!

729
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,326
That's disgusting.

730
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,690
Come on, man. You're dead.

731
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,810
You know, think about it.
It's illegal.

732
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,965
Move! Look out!

733
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,285
Everybody, go home!
There's a psycho killer here!

734
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,961
I cut off my hand,
and it'll kill you all.

735
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,605
Get off the stage!

736
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,521
It's true.
His hand killed us yesterday.

737
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,001
Yeah, it sliced me up real good.

738
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,681
- Molly, you out there?
- Get out of here, kid!

739
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,766
You had your fun!
Now it's time--

740
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,841
Shit!

741
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,928
- God! Did you see that thing?
- I have to get Anton!

742
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,164
No, screw him!
I mean, he'll be fine!

743
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,321
Come on!

744
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:45,927
In there?

745
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,482
You want to stay out here and
get killed as you're trampled?

746
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,363
I was going to get some.

747
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,089
I really doubt it.

748
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,326
Pnub's a lot more creative
than I thought.

749
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,682
I mean, he's actually kind of cool.

750
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,566
- He had that costume--
- Maybe we should go faster.

751
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,404
I don't know if he did it or--

752
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,369
- Wait, wait!
- What, what-J?

753
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,682
Go!

754
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,401
Oh, shit! We're trapped in here!

755
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,086
-It's going to get me!
-It's not going to get you!

756
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,209
It's not going to get you!

757
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,643
We can't go through the blade!
We'll be pulverized!

758
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,245
Give me your shoe!

759
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,204
What are you going to do'?

760
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,206
No, no.
Oh, God, it's too far!

761
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,329
I can't drop that far!

762
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,645
We'll die in this vent!

763
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,644
- We won't die.
- We'll die here.

764
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,566
The rats are gonna eat us,
and nobody's gonna find us.

765
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,051
Okay, we're good.

766
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,082
- Be careful.
- All right, let's go!

767
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:52,404
This would be more comfortable
if your ass wasn't so wide.

768
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,768
- This is dumb.
- Anton needs our help.

769
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,049
The best thing about being dead
is zero responsibility.

770
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,567
That's Tanya. Let's save her.
Come on!

771
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,688
- Hurry up. She needs me.
- She needs you like a fish needs--

772
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,243
Okay, this sucks.

773
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,809
Grab the cord and come down!

774
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,125
I can't. I can't. I'm scared!

775
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,204
Do it, Tanya! Come on!

776
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,204
I can't. It's here.

777
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,044
It's in here. I know it.

778
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,089
Why'd you pull the rope up?

779
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,849
I didn't pull the rope up.

780
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,962
Tanya, where are you'?
I can't see you!

781
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,164
Tanya, talk to me, please!

782
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,845
Just jump! Just jump!

783
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,567
Tanya, grab the rope!

784
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,727
Get it off!

785
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,807
I'm not going through all this Tanya.
Go back that way.

786
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,640
- Now you really won't get any.
-It's unfair.

787
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,406
You can go back if you want
to get a piece.

788
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,365
Fucking hand, I got you now!

789
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,251
Who's your daddy now, bitch?

790
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,641
Who's your fucking--

791
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,683
We're here for you.
Don't worry.

792
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,610
- I made that ashtray!
- Really'?

793
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,126
You let it go again!

794
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,408
Fuck you, then.

795
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,210
Fine, then! You know what?

796
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,169
You aren't crashing at my house.

797
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,811
Did you guys hear that?

798
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,324
Help! Help!

799
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,121
Help me!

800
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,723
Bet she wins Best Costume.

801
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,567
Help me!

802
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,566
The hand's raising the car!

803
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,646
Help me!

804
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,043
Don't worry. We got it under control!

805
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,566
The fucker's got a grip.

806
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,251
Hurry, please!

807
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,483
Those auto-shop boys
are true artistes.

808
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,089
It's Mighty Joe Bong!

809
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,801
I needs me spinach.

810
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,240
I made that.

811
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,364
The ashtray, I'd almost believe.
But this? No way.

812
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,281
Molly's about to get squished,
you bastards!

813
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,921
This is important. For strength.

814
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:37,886
There you go.

815
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,404
Now you're taking Anton-time.

816
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:45,642
You're getting stoned with
your friends? Unbelievable!

817
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,883
That's some one-hit shit there!

818
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:20,968
Don't worry.

819
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,328
I'll get you down.

820
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,088
That's it'?

821
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,889
That's it'?
No explosions, no hellfire, no--'?

822
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,211
I'm glad everyone's all right.

823
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,090
But that was weak.

824
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,523
Well, my work here is done.

825
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,445
Time for the ritualistic sex.
You coming'?

826
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,642
You are a pistol.

827
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,767
Hello'? I'm still up here.

828
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,126
Thanks, Mick.

829
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,600
You're a bud.

830
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,641
Come here.

831
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,407
As usual...

832
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:51,883
...marijuana saves
an otherwise disastrous day.

833
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,928
I never got a hit. Light me.

834
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,485
Sweet Jesus!

835
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,165
That wasn't my fault!

836
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,006
That thing should've come down
a lot slower!

837
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,811
What the hell.

838
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,206
Don't forget my bong.

839
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,363
You did not make that bong.

840
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,601
I arc welded it.

841
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,961
You don't take auto shop.

842
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,571
Fuck you!

843
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,724
You coming, Anton?

844
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,365
I can't even believe it.

845
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,967
You blew off heaven
to kick it with me.

846
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,207
You are the coolest.

847
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,802
You taking care of me
beats the shit out of heaven.

848
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:03,808
Really?

849
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,405
Time for your meds.

850
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,761
Guys! You blew off heaven too'?

851
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,327
No, we're your guardian angels.

852
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,410
Poor thing has delirium.
Visiting hours are over.

853
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,324
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

854
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,001
So the deal is,
we're supposed to monitor you...

855
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,806
...and make sure you don't revert
to your evil ways.

856
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,764
But you seem fine now.

857
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,288
Let's hit the Snack Master in the hall.
You want anything?

858
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,807
Get me Crunch Nuggets.
They're awesome.

859
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,524
Thanks, you guys.

860
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,401
Hit the light.

861
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:13,125
Mick! Pnub!
Come guardian me!

862
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,326
You're right.
Anton screams like a girl.

863
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,086
Think we should tell him
we painted that?

864
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,008
Fuck it.
Let's go walk through a nurse.

865
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,521
Watch it! Some of them are guys.
