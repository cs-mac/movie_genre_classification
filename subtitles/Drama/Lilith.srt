1
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,728
Hi.

2
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:59,057
Oh, thank you.
Can I help you?

3
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,827
Can you tell me where
I can find a Miss Brice?

4
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:03,766
That's me.

5
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:06,406
Well, I'm Vincent Bruce.

6
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,938
Please come in.

7
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:14,704
Won't you sit down?

8
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:17,545
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yeah, thank you.

9
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:21,017
- How do you take it?
- Black.

10
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:43,740
Well, we can begin either with your
telling me all about yourself...

11
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:48,405
or my telling you all about us.
Which would you rather do?

12
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,679
I'd better tell you about me. You may
not want to bother with the rest of it.

13
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,152
All right.

14
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,457
There's not really very much to tell.
I've been out of the Army for a while.

15
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:07,030
I guess I've never had a job
that I was really interested in.

16
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:10,797
You live here in Stonemont,
don't you?

17
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:14,806
I've lived here all my life...

18
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:19,374
and I was always kind of curious
about this place.

19
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:20,946
Why?

20
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:26,445
I don't know. I guess I just was.

21
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:32,818
Are you interested in a permanent job
or just some sort of summer work?

22
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,327
No, I mean a permanent job.

23
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:41,595
I want to do some kind of work where
I can be of direct help to people.

24
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,934
And that's why I decided
to come here.

25
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:33,084
Get out of here.

26
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:36,854
Get out of here.

27
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,936
Vincent, I'd like you
to meet Mr. Polakis.

28
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,200
- Hello.
- This is Mr. Bruce.

29
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:12,352
It's not as disturbing
on this floor, is it?

30
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:15,894
Somehow insanity
seems a lot less sinister...

31
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:19,124
to watch in a man than in a woman,
doesn't it?

32
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:23,837
I thought it best
to show you the worst first.

33
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:02,104
Young man.

34
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,381
- Are you a new patient?
- No, I'm just a visitor.

35
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:10,415
I may go to work here.

36
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:14,017
Tell me, have you read
Dostoyevsky?

37
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:18,216
<i>I've read Crime and Punishment,
and Brothers Karamazov.</i>

38
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:21,920
Oh, have you?
Tell me, do you believe it?

39
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:27,592
Do you believe that if there is no God,
there can be no such thing as virtue?

40
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,431
No.

41
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:38,808
- Do you?
- No.

42
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,751
I do hope you'll come and work here.
We shall be very great friends.

43
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:47,719
I hope so.

44
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:55,821
You handled that very well.

45
00:08:56,898 --> 00:09:01,028
- Have you done a lot of reading?
- Some.

46
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:04,435
When you're in the Army,
you've got nothing but time.

47
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:09,906
It's a lot different
from a state institution, huh?

48
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:12,979
Most of these people come
from very wealthy families.

49
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:17,414
They pay several thousand dollars
a month to keep them here.

50
00:09:20,556 --> 00:09:23,821
Hi, Miss Brice.
Are you going to have lunch now?

51
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,524
It's a nice day, isn't it, Miss Brice?

52
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,824
I hope you have a nice lunch,
Miss Brice.

53
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,695
You have a very nice-looking friend.

54
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:35,770
It certainly is a nice day,
isn't it, Miss Brice?

55
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:39,135
Yes, Miss Glassman. It's a lovely day.

56
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,450
Of course, at first you'll be nothing
but an orderly, more or less.

57
00:09:57,627 --> 00:10:01,757
It's long hours, terrible pay.

58
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:06,600
It's dirty, often degrading,
sometimes dangerous.

59
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:11,238
Do you know why you work here?

60
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:21,310
- Maybe I shouldn't ask you that.
- No, no. That's all right.

61
00:10:21,484 --> 00:10:25,544
It's something that all of us
who work here have to ask ourselves.

62
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:28,485
And we're better off
if we can answer it...

63
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:31,957
as honestly and as thoroughly
as possible.

64
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:34,221
I hope you will too.

65
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:35,986
Miss Brice.

66
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,666
Think about it this evening.

67
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,196
If you don't change your mind,
I'll see you in the morning.

68
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:54,398
- Hi.
- How are you?

69
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:56,909
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Fine.

70
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,874
- I heard you were back.
- I've been back for a while.

71
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,984
I'm glad. They told me
you were wounded or something.

72
00:12:03,152 --> 00:12:05,177
Yeah, or something.

73
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:08,922
- Gee, you look good.
- Thanks. So do you.

74
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:10,923
Did you get my letter?

75
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,051
- How is your husband?
- He's very well, thanks.

76
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,097
He's working with the electric
power company right now...

77
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:19,461
hoping to be office manager
in the fall.

78
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:21,296
- Right here in town, huh?
- Yes.

79
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,704
All your letters never once mentioned
anything about us or our future.

80
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,173
- Didn't I?
- No.

81
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:32,075
Since we never really had any
understanding of a romantic nature...

82
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:33,681
There's my bus.

83
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,877
I hope you visit us sometime. I'd like
you to meet Norman, my husband.

84
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:40,545
- I will. I will.
- Bye.

85
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:56,190
I can have the job if I want it.

86
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:59,494
- Do you?
- Yeah.

87
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:05,400
- You've had no training.
- They'll train me.

88
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:12,813
I want the very best for you.
You know that, don't you, Vincent?

89
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:25,722
Nothing to be ashamed about
working in an insane asylum.

90
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,499
Nothing wrong
with curing sick people.

91
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:44,573
Or is there, Grandma?

92
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:46,809
I'm not hungry.

93
00:14:57,761 --> 00:14:59,820
Vincent.

94
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:04,396
If your poor mother knew
about this job...

95
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:07,002
I think she would be very happy.

96
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:30,516
<i>This was their greatest moment...</i>

97
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:33,552
<i>their moment of triumph...</i>

98
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:37,998
<i>over the bodies
of wounded and dying men.</i>

99
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:49,002
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,875
You'll die.

101
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:53,140
She dies.

102
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,815
Everybody dies.

103
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,271
Fourth floor.

104
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:20,306
- Good morning.
- Morning.

105
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:31,655
You take the third.
Polakis and Levitz.

106
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:35,086
And watch Dostoyevsky.
He's on his fresh-blood kick.

107
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:39,058
- Vincent Bruce, Bob Clayfield.
- We met earlier.

108
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:43,723
Accompany him for the week, observe
the way he deals with the patients...

109
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,494
learn the Lodge rules
and procedures...

110
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,266
and become generally oriented
to the hospital.

111
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:52,164
Come in.

112
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:55,902
- Good morning.
- Morning.

113
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,276
I thought you'd like to meet Mr. Bruce.
He's a new OT.

114
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,611
- Mr. Bruce, Mrs. Meaghan.
- Hello.

115
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,754
How do you do, Mr. Bruce?

116
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:07,252
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

117
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:15,126
It's such a lovely day outside, we
thought you might like to take a walk.

118
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,631
Yes, it is a lovely day.

119
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:21,468
It's very kind of you,
but I cannot leave the building.

120
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:24,938
As you know, I have many enemies.

121
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:29,273
It'll be perfectly safe. Today,
there are two of us to protect you.

122
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:34,040
That's very kind of you.
Perhaps another day.

123
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:40,255
- Does Mr. Bruce play gin rummy?
- Sure, I play gin.

124
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:44,087
I should enjoy playing cards
for a while, if you have the time.

125
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,126
Good.

126
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:49,889
I'll be out in a little while.

127
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,329
- You wanna deal?
- Yes.

128
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:29,238
Cut, please.

129
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,849
She plays quite magically.

130
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,426
She made it herself.
Quite remarkable, isn't it?

131
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,304
Stop playing.

132
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:47,141
I said, stop playing!

133
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:14,203
I understand you've restricted
her playing to certain hours.

134
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,209
I think that's monstrous.

135
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,111
It was a staff decision. Some
of the patients complained, I believe.

136
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:21,809
Monstrous.

137
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,427
I don't feel like
playing cards anymore.

138
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,763
I'll be back in a minute.

139
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:58,554
Wanna play?

140
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,453
Yes.

141
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:07,663
Thank you. Thank you very much.

142
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:30,415
Vincent.

143
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,817
Try to get her down here, will you?

144
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,772
Are you going on the picnic?

145
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,222
May I carry it?

146
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:22,856
- I don't know. May he, Mr. Bruce?
- Sure.

147
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,575
You're very perceptive.
I'm glad you came here.

148
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:41,974
- What nationality are you?
- I'm an American.

149
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,914
- No, I mean what descent are you?
- Mostly English, I guess.

150
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,315
Would you marry an English girl?
I mean, of English descent?

151
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,585
I don't know, I'm...

152
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:55,192
- Would you think I was Jewish?
- It never occurred to me.

153
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,955
Many think I am, but I'm Polish.
My grandfather was a priest.

154
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:03,760
I might get out of here soon. I'm
almost well. I might even get married.

155
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,334
Should I bring them back?

156
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:52,273
No. Stay where you are
untiI it lets up.

157
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,163
He says we can stay.

158
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,422
I never knew
you could paint like that...

159
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,329
simply with grasses
and things of that kind.

160
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:52,334
They fade, but there are no colors
like them while they last.

161
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:57,933
I'd love to paint
or do anything like that.

162
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,812
How do you begin?
What is it that you do?

163
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:05,610
I don't do anything.
My hand just moves, and I follow it.

164
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,186
That's it.
Your hand moves, mine doesn't.

165
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,615
I can't trust my hands.

166
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,987
You must learn if you want them
to lead you to things you love.

167
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:18,892
No, I'm afraid I have
a scholar's mind, not an artist's.

168
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,123
It's a very different faculty,
you know.

169
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,269
You have the gift of tongues.
That's a great gift.

170
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,370
But it's nothing compared to you.

171
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:31,202
I've studied them. I know the grammar,
but you've invented one of your own.

172
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,743
- That's the greatest gift.
- I didn't invent it.

173
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,109
- It was taught to me by my people.
- You actually hear it, then?

174
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:39,751
I mean, you actually
hear them speaking it?

175
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,015
Oh, I'd love to hear it. I'm fascinated
by languages, you know.

176
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,454
Do you think they would
speak it to me?

177
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,926
Perhaps you would teach me.

178
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,688
I wouldn't be allowed to teach you
without approval.

179
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:54,265
It's a language very few
are permitted to speak.

180
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:57,732
But what would I have to do?
I'm sure I could persuade them.

181
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:02,670
You would have to demonstrate great
courage and a great capacity for joy.

182
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:07,938
But I can. But I can.
You don't understand me.

183
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,549
Eat this, then.

184
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:17,815
They might make me sick.
They could be poisonous.

185
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,630
Don't do that. Spit it out.

186
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:34,705
- Have I made you angry, Mr. Bruce?
- He was right. It might be poisonous.

187
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,138
It wouldn't hurt me if it is.

188
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:41,443
- You worry about me, then?
- I'm responsible for you.

189
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,013
Yes, then I'll be very good.

190
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:47,711
I promise not to get sick.
I wouldn't want to embarrass you.

191
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:54,826
You hurt my hand.

192
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,862
Let me see.

193
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:04,435
You have exquisite hands.

194
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,962
I bite my nails.

195
00:30:12,712 --> 00:30:15,340
If I learned to trust my hands...

196
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:18,348
would they really lead me
to the things I love?

197
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:17,272
Vincent, come on. We're leaving.

198
00:33:21,902 --> 00:33:25,736
Mr. Bruce, you haven't said anything
about my painting.

199
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,065
- Do you know what you almost did?
- What?

200
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:33,178
You almost killed a boy.
How can you let a paintbrush...

201
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:37,613
fall 15 yards in front of you?
- I was shaking the paint out of it.

202
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:40,480
- Why'd you make him go after it?
- Because he's a fool.

203
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:42,814
If he's a fool,
why do you lead him on?

204
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:45,253
Because I'm mad.

205
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,187
<i>Perhaps she was testing him.</i>

206
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:54,025
<i>Demanding a
demonstration of courage from him.</i>

207
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:58,100
- Or an act of worship.
- I don't know what she was doing.

208
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,503
If she wanted to kill him, why didn't
she simply push him off the cliff?

209
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:05,235
All I know is, I shouldn't have
left him alone.

210
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:08,869
Look, that was my mistake, not yours.

211
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:13,782
I gave you the assignment. You
didn't have enough experience yet.

212
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:17,790
I thought it would be
good training for you.

213
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:20,283
The hard way, huh?

214
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:24,564
When I brought her back,
I tried to get her to admit what she did.

215
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:27,700
It was like trying to get her
to admit she's insane.

216
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:31,865
- She makes you forget she's a patient.
- Yes, she does.

217
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:34,506
She's very clever.

218
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:39,343
You still want to resign?

219
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:45,407
Could it be that you're
afraid of failing?

220
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:51,148
Do you remember I told you
we never issue a set of keys...

221
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:55,385
to a worker untiI we think
he's ready?

222
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:05,530
If you didn't feel so deeply, I wouldn't
have this much respect for you.

223
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:24,356
- Hi.
- Hi.

224
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:43,174
Have you seen her? Is she all right?
Did she ask about me?

225
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:46,801
- She say anything about last week?
- I haven't seen her.

226
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,108
I haven't either,
or heard her playing either.

227
00:35:50,284 --> 00:35:53,151
- You don't suppose she's ill?
- No, no, I don't think so.

228
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:58,586
You ought to realize it wouldn't be
right for me to act as a go-between.

229
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:01,956
I understand, yes, of course.
I beg your pardon.

230
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:05,288
I thought you'd understand
my being anxious.

231
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:08,993
I do. And when I see her,
I'll tell her that you asked about her.

232
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:12,196
Will you? That's very kind of you.

233
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:16,206
I don't mean to embarrass you,
but it means a great deal to me.

234
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:19,937
- I know.
- I suppose you think it's foolish...

235
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:23,550
rather absurd,
this attachment of mine.

236
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:26,185
I don't think there's anything
foolish about it.

237
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,082
- You don't?
- No.

238
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:31,391
Not even under
these grotesque conditions?

239
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,322
No.

240
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:37,830
Well, still, it's possible to think of it
as a rather foolish thing.

241
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:41,525
She's so proud, you know?
Such a delicate creature.

242
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:46,162
And yet she allowed me to touch
her hair for a moment. You saw that.

243
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:50,432
You see, I really have
nothing else to live for.

244
00:36:50,844 --> 00:36:52,869
Fourteen.

245
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:09,026
So many of these people
have such extraordinary minds.

246
00:37:09,197 --> 00:37:11,324
Such extraordinary sensibilities.

247
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:14,764
Too extraordinary, I think, sometimes.

248
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,170
This is not a scientific theory.

249
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:22,672
Maybe it's romantic, but I often
compare them to fine crystal...

250
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:28,748
which has been shattered by the
shock of some intolerable revelation.

251
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:33,279
I have the feeling when I talk
with them, they have seen too much...

252
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:36,217
with too fine an instrument.

253
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,291
That they have been close
to some extreme...

254
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:44,390
to something absolute
and been blasted by it.

255
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:49,426
That they have been destroyed, one
might say, by their own excellence.

256
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:56,306
Regarded in this way,
they are the heroes of the universe.

257
00:37:56,477 --> 00:38:00,573
Its finest product
and its noblest casualty.

258
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:04,846
Schizophrenia, however, is far
from an exclusive affliction...

259
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:06,610
of the superior mind.

260
00:38:06,788 --> 00:38:10,519
As a matter of fact, by using a
substance from the blood of humans...

261
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:14,388
schizophrenia has been
induced in dogs...

262
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:17,224
spiders, as well as men.

263
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:29,206
As you will note, the web
of most normal spider species...

264
00:38:29,377 --> 00:38:34,439
is as distinctive and invariable
as their coloring.

265
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,883
But the mad ones spin out
fantastic, asymmetrical...

266
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:47,453
and rather nightmarish designs.

267
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:50,223
A most unsettling fact.

268
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:13,512
What's that...?
What language is that?

269
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,587
It's mine.

270
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:23,196
What do you mean,
your own language?

271
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,644
Why did you come here?

272
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:45,577
I needed a job.

273
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,213
You could get a job in a butcher shop.

274
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:53,285
Grocery store, gas station.

275
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:57,762
You were in the Army?

276
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:00,997
Were you a hero?

277
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,402
I didn't think so.

278
00:40:11,012 --> 00:40:13,606
Did you come here for excitement?

279
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:15,612
Excitement?

280
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:18,375
Adventure?

281
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:23,117
I'm not an adventurer.

282
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:26,019
I think you are.

283
00:40:27,496 --> 00:40:28,757
Why?

284
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:35,632
You're ill at ease. Adventurous people
are always a little ill at ease.

285
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:40,240
They're shy. They aren't bold
the way people think they are.

286
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:43,809
They go stumbling around,
breaking things, being scolded.

287
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:46,641
Always looking for a place
they feel they'll belong.

288
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,545
They have that crooked look.

289
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,619
The crooked look?

290
00:40:53,155 --> 00:40:56,089
Of not really matching anything.

291
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:09,636
I'd like to go for a walk now.

292
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:55,705
I didn't think they'd let me go on
any more trips after the picnic.

293
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:59,911
Well, there's some
pretty smart people here.

294
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:03,487
My people punished me.

295
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:09,655
How?

296
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,891
What'd they do to you?

297
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:15,001
They wept.
That's how they always punish me.

298
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,599
They come and kneel at my bed
and sob.

299
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:23,678
Have you ever heard someone
that you loved weeping?

300
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:33,479
Sometimes I hear my mother cry.

301
00:42:34,122 --> 00:42:35,385
Do you?

302
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:40,921
Is she unhappy?

303
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:42,757
Not now.

304
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,955
At least, I hope not.

305
00:42:49,972 --> 00:42:51,530
What was your mother like?

306
00:43:28,177 --> 00:43:31,146
Hands lie so still in death.

307
00:43:34,683 --> 00:43:38,050
You've killed with these hands. Why?

308
00:43:40,355 --> 00:43:42,152
That's the business of a soldier.

309
00:43:42,324 --> 00:43:47,227
You must love your god a lot to
kill for him and still go on loving him.

310
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,789
I'd never ask that of a lover.

311
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:53,627
I'd only ask his joy.

312
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:58,936
<i>Look at her.
She wants to be like me.</i>

313
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:01,268
She's lovely.

314
00:44:04,446 --> 00:44:08,212
My kisses kill her.
She's like all of them.

315
00:44:08,383 --> 00:44:11,250
Destroys them to be loved.

316
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:14,822
Can I go farther?

317
00:44:31,207 --> 00:44:32,901
Lilith?

318
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:36,372
Lilith?

319
00:44:50,225 --> 00:44:52,386
You call me "Lilith."

320
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,296
Well, at least that'll be
a very unusual kind of cloth, huh?

321
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:02,665
- You think it's beautiful?
- Yes.

322
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,471
You gonna cut your hair?

323
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,674
There are scissors there on the table.
Will you hand them to me?

324
00:45:11,848 --> 00:45:13,281
Nope.

325
00:45:13,448 --> 00:45:15,245
You won't?

326
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:20,349
What'll you do? Leave me
chained here by my hair untiI I starve?

327
00:45:23,292 --> 00:45:25,351
Gonna set you free.

328
00:45:25,528 --> 00:45:27,688
That'll be difficult.

329
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:33,562
This was to be a present for you.
A throw for your bed.

330
00:45:33,935 --> 00:45:36,632
I made it especially for you.

331
00:45:37,706 --> 00:45:39,901
To make you dream.

332
00:45:46,248 --> 00:45:48,375
You're very gentle.

333
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:52,883
I'm glad you're not leaving.

334
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:57,487
I think you do a great deal of good
here. I think the patients trust you.

335
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:59,855
It'd be very foolish
if you were to leave.

336
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:07,963
These reports of mine
are not completely accurate.

337
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:11,230
They're factual, but they
don't express what really happens.

338
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:15,206
The atmosphere of your relationship
is different from what the reports say?

339
00:46:15,377 --> 00:46:18,870
- Right.
- Are you disturbed about it?

340
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,841
Let me put it quite candidly.

341
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:27,420
Do you feel she's trying
to seduce you?

342
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,080
Well, it's not that simple.

343
00:46:32,327 --> 00:46:36,127
Well, you could call it that.
But it's not...

344
00:46:36,298 --> 00:46:40,895
It's not just a physical thing.
It's much more than that.

345
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:46,508
I'm not sure what it is
that she's trying to offer.

346
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:52,907
It's almost like she wants to share
this magic little world of hers.

347
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:55,141
And...

348
00:46:56,753 --> 00:46:58,880
Does that all sound strange to you?

349
00:46:59,055 --> 00:47:01,319
No, that doesn't sound strange.

350
00:47:01,691 --> 00:47:05,092
It isn't unknown, you know,
for patients to seduce personnel...

351
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:07,786
and vice versa, unfortunately.

352
00:47:15,036 --> 00:47:17,665
Do you ever feel inclined to accept?

353
00:47:20,076 --> 00:47:21,634
Yeah.

354
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:25,076
Yeah, sometimes I do.
And...

355
00:47:25,647 --> 00:47:29,584
You see, I don't really think
that Lilith is unhappy.

356
00:47:29,919 --> 00:47:32,353
Most of the patients are.

357
00:47:32,522 --> 00:47:35,753
But I don't think she is.
She's got some...

358
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:42,996
- I don't know, she's got a kind of a...
- Rapture.

359
00:47:43,266 --> 00:47:45,062
- What was the word?
- Rapture.

360
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:47,168
Rapture? That's a good word for it.

361
00:47:47,336 --> 00:47:50,066
Yes, it is. In Shakespeare's time,
it meant "madness"...

362
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,003
as the words "ecstasy"
and "innocence" often did.

363
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:57,409
I think all of us here are concerned
with rapture in some way.

364
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,516
And when a man devotes himself
to studying the nature of rapture...

365
00:48:01,684 --> 00:48:03,777
he may find himself
dispossessed by it.

366
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:06,817
That's one of the risks we take.

367
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:09,890
Does she ever talk to you
about her delusions?

368
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:13,657
Yeah.

369
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,297
Oh, yeah.

370
00:48:15,465 --> 00:48:19,902
In her case, it's seldom possible
to tell what is fantasy and what is fact.

371
00:48:21,737 --> 00:48:24,001
Has she ever spoken to you
about her family?

372
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:28,803
No, I don't think so.

373
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:32,379
She had a brother who was
killed accidentally in a fall.

374
00:48:32,548 --> 00:48:35,278
She's never mentioned him,
I suppose.

375
00:48:51,535 --> 00:48:53,730
Well, you know,
I never try to question her.

376
00:48:54,504 --> 00:48:56,267
No, I wouldn't.

377
00:48:56,439 --> 00:48:58,964
That's apt to be disastrous.

378
00:49:01,244 --> 00:49:04,407
How long did you say
that she's been here?

379
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:06,377
Since she was 18.

380
00:49:09,919 --> 00:49:12,080
What do you think of her chances?

381
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:16,050
Very small.

382
00:49:17,426 --> 00:49:20,487
Still, you never can tell.
She's been doing very well lately.

383
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:24,224
I'm particularly pleased with the
influence you seem to have on her.

384
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,063
This is a girl that, since she's
been here, has had no contact...

385
00:49:28,238 --> 00:49:30,069
with any world except her own.

386
00:49:30,373 --> 00:49:32,773
I think you're doing a damn good job.

387
00:49:34,244 --> 00:49:37,735
It's a very small chance
that we're talking about.

388
00:49:45,254 --> 00:49:47,951
You saw Dr. Lavrier last week,
didn't you?

389
00:49:50,993 --> 00:49:53,086
You talk about me?

390
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,159
Among other things.

391
00:49:57,767 --> 00:49:59,030
What'd you say?

392
00:50:03,773 --> 00:50:05,400
Tell me.

393
00:50:05,575 --> 00:50:07,703
You think I should, huh?

394
00:50:09,446 --> 00:50:11,208
You think I would?

395
00:50:15,351 --> 00:50:19,310
I invent all sorts of stories for him
about my childhood.

396
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:20,979
You think he believes them?

397
00:50:22,392 --> 00:50:26,384
He'll believe anything about me
except that I'm happy.

398
00:50:26,796 --> 00:50:30,324
It's all he exists for,
inventions and confessions.

399
00:50:30,499 --> 00:50:33,435
- I'm sure he'd love to hear yours.
- What would I tell him?

400
00:50:33,603 --> 00:50:35,128
Don't you know?

401
00:50:42,512 --> 00:50:44,241
Excuse me.

402
00:50:44,414 --> 00:50:46,404
Good morning, Miss Arthur.

403
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,318
I'm making something for you...

404
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:52,454
in the shop. They told me
next week was your birthday...

405
00:50:52,622 --> 00:50:56,081
and I wanted to give you something.
I wonder if I should tell you.

406
00:50:56,258 --> 00:50:58,250
I think it's going to be quite nice.

407
00:50:58,428 --> 00:51:00,862
I've been spending a lot of time on it.

408
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:03,794
It should be finished in a day or two.

409
00:51:04,935 --> 00:51:06,732
Are you going bicycling?

410
00:51:06,903 --> 00:51:09,166
It's a lovely day for it.

411
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,665
May I come with you?

412
00:51:12,709 --> 00:51:14,233
I'm sorry...

413
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,776
maybe we can do it another time.

414
00:51:19,983 --> 00:51:22,178
That's very disappointing.

415
00:52:40,465 --> 00:52:41,931
Wait, wait.

416
00:52:42,566 --> 00:52:44,261
Wait.

417
00:52:46,804 --> 00:52:49,363
Tell me now, please.

418
00:52:49,539 --> 00:52:51,837
You think I don't know
how you suffer?

419
00:52:52,008 --> 00:52:55,172
I do. I know how terrible it is
to love somebody...

420
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:57,906
and not be able to confess
your love.

421
00:52:58,482 --> 00:53:00,882
But you can tell me.

422
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:04,487
Please.

423
00:53:04,654 --> 00:53:07,123
I can't stand it.

424
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:10,282
I can't stand it anymore.

425
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:18,230
This is a bad cut.
We'll have to go back.

426
00:53:44,327 --> 00:53:47,160
You've got blood on your face.

427
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,791
You feel cleaner now?

428
00:53:54,137 --> 00:53:56,834
You think I infected you?

429
00:53:57,742 --> 00:53:59,471
Lilith.

430
00:53:59,743 --> 00:54:03,373
I've never been able to do
anything worthwhile in my life.

431
00:54:03,548 --> 00:54:07,950
I wish you would help me to do
just one thing well, honorably.

432
00:54:08,652 --> 00:54:11,678
If you wanna help me, go away.

433
00:54:11,856 --> 00:54:14,882
I can't be saved by honor.

434
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:18,185
Well, how does everybody
feel today?

435
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:20,762
You're all so solemn.

436
00:54:21,566 --> 00:54:26,628
Did anything happen today that
somebody would like to talk about?

437
00:54:27,638 --> 00:54:30,573
Doesn't anybody
have anything to say?

438
00:54:32,643 --> 00:54:34,633
Miss Verigold...

439
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:38,373
you've just come back to us.
Is there anything you'd like to say?

440
00:54:38,549 --> 00:54:41,985
I'm happy to be back with...

441
00:54:49,894 --> 00:54:52,590
That is so stupid.

442
00:54:52,763 --> 00:54:56,028
- "Marigold."
- Well, I would like to...

443
00:54:58,068 --> 00:55:01,970
Why were you laughing
when Miss Verigold was speaking?

444
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:04,902
I just think her name is so funny.

445
00:55:05,076 --> 00:55:07,442
Her name is so funny,
it cracks me up.

446
00:55:07,878 --> 00:55:10,404
I have a new understanding now.

447
00:55:15,952 --> 00:55:19,582
Benito, you had something on your
mind you had to tell the whole group.

448
00:55:20,091 --> 00:55:21,524
How about it?

449
00:55:39,877 --> 00:55:42,971
Did you ever see
a dancer that smoked?

450
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:49,749
I don't want it anymore.
I don't know why.

451
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:53,482
I was born to do it.
I was born to move.

452
00:55:53,658 --> 00:55:58,925
I was born to be free.
I was born to express, to create.

453
00:55:59,864 --> 00:56:03,356
I got nothing left anymore.
I'm drained.

454
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:07,163
I know I do...
I know...

455
00:56:08,306 --> 00:56:10,365
Love it.

456
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:16,343
But it seems to me that
that love that I have I can easily hate.

457
00:56:17,915 --> 00:56:23,319
- Destroy because it possesses me...
- Who gave you the right to destroy?

458
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:27,688
- Who gave you the right to destroy?
- Nobody gave me the right.

459
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:30,419
- I chose the right.
- You have no such right.

460
00:56:30,594 --> 00:56:34,360
You have no right to destroy the gift
God gave you. It belongs to us all.

461
00:56:34,532 --> 00:56:36,295
I don't accept that. It's my gift.

462
00:56:36,468 --> 00:56:39,129
- I do with it as I please.
- Who do you think you are?

463
00:56:39,303 --> 00:56:42,170
How dare you take such a prerogative
into your own hands!

464
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,433
- Really?
- Yes! Yes!

465
00:56:44,608 --> 00:56:47,008
- You have no right.
- What do you mean, who am I?

466
00:56:47,178 --> 00:56:49,669
Who are...?
God gave you a great gift.

467
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:52,645
It was for us that he meant it.
It's for us...

468
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:56,583
to judge if you have the right...
- It's not for you to judge anything.

469
00:56:56,754 --> 00:56:59,120
What you lack is a sense of reality.

470
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,451
What's so wonderful about reality?

471
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:03,480
<i>Why don't you tell me you love me?
Why don't you tell me you want me?</i>

472
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:04,917
<i>Because I love you.</i>

473
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,580
<i>I can't be saved by honor.</i>

474
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:20,633
<i>To make you dream.
To make you dream.</i>

475
00:58:37,321 --> 00:58:40,553
<i>To make you dream.
To make you dream.</i>

476
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:43,090
<i>You call me "Lilith."</i>

477
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:51,435
Good morning. That was some storm
we had last night. You see any of it?

478
00:58:51,603 --> 00:58:54,595
Yeah. About 3:00, the shutter
broke loose, woke me up.

479
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,041
I don't think I've seen rain like that.

480
00:58:58,844 --> 00:59:02,211
- I read your report. Did it go well?
- It went pretty well.

481
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,244
You feeling secure about yourself?

482
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:07,907
I think that was all imagination
or beginner's nerves or something.

483
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,452
Are you still getting a lot of fantasy?

484
00:59:10,622 --> 00:59:13,113
No, I mentioned that in the report.

485
00:59:13,757 --> 00:59:16,590
No personal talk
that I should know about?

486
00:59:16,862 --> 00:59:19,955
- No. No.
- Well, keep in touch with me.

487
00:59:20,132 --> 00:59:23,659
She'd like to go and see that
jousting tournament in Barnesville...

488
00:59:23,834 --> 00:59:26,599
and I said I'd ask
your permission, so...

489
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,671
Did you ask her yourself?

490
00:59:28,906 --> 00:59:32,707
It just came up. Something we
were talking about. Horses, I think.

491
00:59:33,378 --> 00:59:37,439
All the other OTs have given me such
good reports. I'm pleased about it.

492
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,980
By all means, take her.

493
00:59:41,353 --> 00:59:42,945
Thank you.

494
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,969
It's like another time and place.

495
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:06,906
- Knights and lances.
- Oh, this is a very old custom.

496
01:00:07,078 --> 01:00:09,808
They brought it here from England.
Except nowadays...

497
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,417
instead of knocking each other
off horses, we spear that ring.

498
01:00:13,984 --> 01:00:15,247
Really?

499
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,514
I did this before I was in the service,
when I was a kid.

500
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,749
You any good at it?

501
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:23,060
I'm pretty good.

502
01:00:46,986 --> 01:00:49,146
<i>Candy apples. Candy apples.</i>

503
01:00:49,321 --> 01:00:52,415
<i>Get your candy apples.
Fifteen cents.</i>

504
01:00:52,591 --> 01:00:56,426
<i>Candy apples. Fifteen cents.
Get your candy apples.</i>

505
01:01:01,733 --> 01:01:03,030
That doll.

506
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,635
- Which one?
- That one. I want it.

507
01:01:39,505 --> 01:01:41,438
How much are your watermelons?

508
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:45,303
Twenty-five cents.
The big ones is 25 cents.

509
01:01:45,478 --> 01:01:49,574
- How much is the ice?
- We're not selling the ice, ma'am.

510
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:52,942
I'd rather have a piece of ice.
Can't I have a tiny piece?

511
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:54,381
Yes, ma'am.

512
01:01:54,853 --> 01:01:56,684
Let me do it.

513
01:02:01,693 --> 01:02:03,422
It's like a diamond.

514
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,563
Yes, ma'am.

515
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,824
She swallowed the diamond!

516
01:02:11,202 --> 01:02:15,195
It'd cut her all up inside if it was.
She'd bleed.

517
01:02:16,876 --> 01:02:18,901
- Wanna see my blood?
- Yes, ma'am.

518
01:02:19,077 --> 01:02:21,046
Touch my lips.

519
01:02:30,356 --> 01:02:32,824
It ain't none.
I known you was fooling.

520
01:02:32,992 --> 01:02:36,189
There is, but you can't see it.
It's clear, like water.

521
01:02:36,362 --> 01:02:38,091
She got white blood.

522
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:42,991
- What color's yours?
- Mine's red. I get cut a lot.

523
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:45,262
No, it's not.

524
01:02:45,504 --> 01:02:46,869
It's blue.

525
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,634
Hot and blue.

526
01:02:51,076 --> 01:02:53,773
I don't have any money.
Can't pay you for the diamond.

527
01:02:53,946 --> 01:02:55,572
Shall I give you a kiss instead?

528
01:02:57,615 --> 01:03:00,448
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come here.

529
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:22,168
Goodbye. Thanks. It was delicious.

530
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,586
He's the most beautiful one of all.
He shines like gold.

531
01:03:44,764 --> 01:03:48,961
Vince never told me he was
gonna bring you. He's a sly deviI.

532
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,133
Are you gonna ride?

533
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,830
For me?

534
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:00,406
You better take the lance too.
It's over by the tree.

535
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:02,274
I'll get it.

536
01:04:11,957 --> 01:04:15,324
How you gonna ride? I gotta fill out
a entry blank with your name.

537
01:04:15,494 --> 01:04:17,826
- Knight of Poplar Lodge.
- What colors?

538
01:04:18,264 --> 01:04:19,526
Can I use your scarf?

539
01:04:20,633 --> 01:04:22,624
Blue and gold.

540
01:04:58,204 --> 01:05:01,640
<i>We will now commence
the riding of the tournament.</i>

541
01:05:01,807 --> 01:05:04,935
<i>Sir knights, the rules
are as follows:</i>

542
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:08,079
<i>Distance of the course is 80 yards.</i>

543
01:05:08,247 --> 01:05:11,705
<i>The time to ride the course
is 10 seconds.</i>

544
01:05:11,884 --> 01:05:13,944
<i>Your rings are now hanging...</i>

545
01:05:14,453 --> 01:05:16,444
<i>6 feet, 9 inches
from the ground.</i>

546
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:19,785
<i>We will now commence
the riding of the tournament.</i>

547
01:05:22,896 --> 01:05:25,625
<i>Knight of Doranstown,
prepare to charge.</i>

548
01:05:27,534 --> 01:05:30,970
<i>Clear the track, please.
Keep your balloons still, children.</i>

549
01:05:31,438 --> 01:05:33,769
<i>Charge, sir knight.</i>

550
01:05:46,753 --> 01:05:48,653
<i>Three rings.</i>

551
01:06:19,953 --> 01:06:23,684
<i>We will now reduce the rings
to three-quarter of an inch.</i>

552
01:06:24,323 --> 01:06:28,054
<i>The ring hangers will now hang
the three-quarter inch rings.</i>

553
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:31,288
<i>Knight of Doranstown,
prepare to charge.</i>

554
01:06:31,831 --> 01:06:33,695
<i>Keep the tracks clear, please.</i>

555
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:35,766
<i>Charge, sir knight.</i>

556
01:06:44,611 --> 01:06:46,636
<i>Three rings. Three rings.</i>

557
01:06:53,587 --> 01:06:56,817
<i>Knight of Poplar Lodge,
prepare to charge.</i>

558
01:06:58,959 --> 01:07:00,824
<i>Charge, sir knight.</i>

559
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:12,663
<i>Three rings!</i>

560
01:07:13,206 --> 01:07:18,610
<i>9.3 seconds.
Best of the day, and the winner.</i>

561
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:33,987
- Is this your lady?
- Yes.

562
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,129
Crown her queen
of love and beauty.

563
01:08:55,542 --> 01:08:57,237
I love you.

564
01:10:02,108 --> 01:10:05,043
If I died tonight,
would it have been enough?

565
01:10:14,287 --> 01:10:16,415
Then I'll live forever.

566
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:45,543
So smooth...

567
01:10:47,488 --> 01:10:50,285
everywhere but where they
wounded you.

568
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,460
Now the wound's mine.

569
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:28,958
Hello.

570
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:31,761
Good evening.

571
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:35,433
Aren't you gonna go in
to dinner?

572
01:11:36,336 --> 01:11:38,237
In a little while.

573
01:11:45,112 --> 01:11:48,843
I can bring a tray up to your room
if you want me to.

574
01:11:49,483 --> 01:11:50,972
No, thank you.

575
01:11:54,555 --> 01:11:56,785
I couldn't help noticing
you've succeeded...

576
01:11:56,957 --> 01:12:00,859
in persuading Miss Arthur to
accompany you on several occasions.

577
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:07,557
That's quite remarkable, considering
she hasn't been out in months.

578
01:12:09,403 --> 01:12:13,430
That, of course,
is in your line of duty, isn't it?

579
01:12:15,876 --> 01:12:17,342
Isn't it?

580
01:12:18,913 --> 01:12:22,610
I'm sure you think of yourself
as a very persuasive young man.

581
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:25,248
That's my job.

582
01:12:26,921 --> 01:12:29,890
I should find it a most
depressing kind of work.

583
01:12:30,057 --> 01:12:34,494
Entertaining eccentric spinsters,
pushing witless girls about.

584
01:12:38,065 --> 01:12:40,329
I don't think of it that way.

585
01:12:41,468 --> 01:12:43,333
No, I'm sure you don't.

586
01:12:44,004 --> 01:12:46,472
You seem to be a man
of principle.

587
01:12:49,777 --> 01:12:52,473
That's less flattering
than you believed.

588
01:12:59,253 --> 01:13:01,244
Good evening, Mr...

589
01:13:04,258 --> 01:13:05,748
Bruce.

590
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,559
Oh, yes, of course.

591
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,256
Principles, Mr. Bruce...

592
01:13:11,231 --> 01:13:13,324
should always be examined.

593
01:13:57,311 --> 01:13:59,371
We have to be careful.

594
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:08,155
Do you think loving me is sinful?

595
01:14:11,925 --> 01:14:14,393
Think I have a talent for love?

596
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:22,697
If my talent were greater than you
think, would you stop loving me?

597
01:14:34,214 --> 01:14:35,546
I don't think you love me.

598
01:14:38,086 --> 01:14:41,612
There are a lot of things that
aren't allowed, but we've done them.

599
01:14:44,124 --> 01:14:45,990
I wonder what they'd do
if they knew.

600
01:14:50,998 --> 01:14:52,261
Should I tell them?

601
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:56,929
I think, if you think they'll take your
word against mine, you tell them.

602
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:02,540
If someone on the staff were to support
my story, maybe they would.

603
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:08,141
What are you talking about?

604
01:15:12,787 --> 01:15:16,450
If I lose this job,
then we don't see each other anymore.

605
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:29,627
I love you, Vincent.

606
01:17:21,749 --> 01:17:23,512
You dirty bitch.

607
01:17:32,827 --> 01:17:35,921
If you should discover
that your god loved others...

608
01:17:36,097 --> 01:17:39,032
as much as he loved you,
would you hate him for it?

609
01:17:40,468 --> 01:17:43,631
I show my love for all of you,
and you despise me.

610
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:08,697
Oh, Mr. Bruce?
I want to show this to you.

611
01:18:08,863 --> 01:18:11,127
It's the gift I'm making for her.

612
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:15,062
I showed it to Miss Brice before.
She thought it was lovely, didn't you?

613
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:17,204
- Yes.
- It's made out of cedar.

614
01:18:17,372 --> 01:18:19,898
As you can see,
the design is very intricate.

615
01:18:20,074 --> 01:18:22,942
You know, I've never made anything
with my hands before.

616
01:18:23,344 --> 01:18:25,539
It's for her pastels.

617
01:18:33,388 --> 01:18:36,381
I've never seen her so happy before,
have you?

618
01:21:53,222 --> 01:21:55,020
Vincent?

619
01:22:00,363 --> 01:22:02,489
Vincent, my goodness.

620
01:22:02,664 --> 01:22:05,463
What in the world are you doing
out there in the rain?

621
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:11,697
I just went out for a walk,
and I happened to be passing by.

622
01:22:15,411 --> 01:22:17,674
Why don't you stop in for a minute.

623
01:22:18,447 --> 01:22:21,042
We're just about to have our coffee.

624
01:22:22,084 --> 01:22:24,518
Would you like to have
a cup with us?

625
01:22:24,854 --> 01:22:28,084
I know Norman would like
to meet you very much.

626
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:31,292
If it isn't too much trouble,
I'd like to meet him.

627
01:22:41,704 --> 01:22:43,365
Norman.

628
01:22:44,306 --> 01:22:47,367
Norman, this is Vincent Bruce
that I told you so much about.

629
01:22:47,543 --> 01:22:51,673
Well, how do you do? We've been
waiting long enough for this pleasure.

630
01:22:51,848 --> 01:22:54,577
- Thank you.
- Vincent happened to be passing by.

631
01:22:54,751 --> 01:22:58,585
- He'll have a cup of coffee with us.
- Fine, wonderful.

632
01:22:58,755 --> 01:23:02,589
Sit down there, Vince,
while Laura stirs us up some coffee.

633
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:05,727
- You won't be long?
- It's almost ready.

634
01:23:05,894 --> 01:23:09,227
- Remember my meeting?
- I don't see how I could forget it.

635
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:13,596
I've got United Citizens CounciI
tonight.

636
01:23:13,769 --> 01:23:16,466
Women don't understand
the importance of civic things.

637
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,765
A man attends
his civic responsibilities...

638
01:23:18,941 --> 01:23:22,605
and they feel deserted.
- I guess they do.

639
01:23:25,814 --> 01:23:28,409
I guess you're mighty glad to be back,
aren't you?

640
01:23:28,685 --> 01:23:31,084
- Yeah.
- It's quite an adventure, wasn't it?

641
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:32,914
Yes, it was.

642
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:37,318
I tried twice to sign up myself,
but I couldn't make the grade.

643
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:39,993
Colon trouble.

644
01:23:44,634 --> 01:23:47,228
The TV bother you? I'll just...

645
01:23:55,678 --> 01:23:58,010
Say, I don't suppose
there's any possibility...

646
01:23:58,181 --> 01:24:01,241
you knew my brother.
He's in the 1 st Marine Division...

647
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:04,112
over there in your part
of the world somewhere.

648
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:08,882
No, no, I don't.

649
01:24:09,459 --> 01:24:13,895
- That was a great outfit, though.
- Great outfit, wasn't it? Great.

650
01:24:14,529 --> 01:24:17,124
Nick had a fine war record.
He's doing well now too.

651
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:21,396
He turned out to be real natural
as a traveling salesman.

652
01:24:21,603 --> 01:24:24,835
Found a kind of unusual line
for an ex-Marine.

653
01:24:25,608 --> 01:24:27,371
Every time I see him now, I say:

654
01:24:27,543 --> 01:24:31,001
"Nick, I never thought I'd see you
in ladies' underwear."

655
01:24:32,148 --> 01:24:34,844
Ladies' underwear, that's his line,
ladies' underwear.

656
01:24:35,017 --> 01:24:36,952
Yeah, I got it.

657
01:24:41,189 --> 01:24:45,650
The joke's on us. He made 3600
last year in commissions.

658
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:48,319
There's no laugh about that,
is there?

659
01:24:49,232 --> 01:24:50,859
No.

660
01:24:58,341 --> 01:25:01,037
I wish sometimes
I went on the road myself.

661
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:04,111
It's a good life,
in more ways than one.

662
01:25:13,089 --> 01:25:14,852
Honey!

663
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:19,490
Do you have to shout like that,
Norman?

664
01:25:19,662 --> 01:25:21,789
You know Mother's
trying to get some sleep.

665
01:25:21,964 --> 01:25:24,432
Well, let's not go into that now.

666
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:26,862
How about the coffee?

667
01:25:34,944 --> 01:25:37,037
I don't want to barge in
on you like this.

668
01:25:37,213 --> 01:25:40,740
No, no, no. You stay.
We want to hear all about you.

669
01:25:40,917 --> 01:25:43,715
Laura tells me you're over
at the asylum. Is that right?

670
01:25:43,886 --> 01:25:49,324
Yeah, I'm training to be something
they call an occupational therapist.

671
01:25:50,126 --> 01:25:53,459
Is that so?
An occupational therapist?

672
01:25:56,599 --> 01:25:59,159
I bet that's pretty interesting work,
isn't it?

673
01:26:01,838 --> 01:26:03,863
- It can be.
- Yeah.

674
01:26:07,477 --> 01:26:09,069
Say...

675
01:26:10,446 --> 01:26:15,146
I bet you some pretty funny stuff
goes on in a place like that, isn't it?

676
01:26:29,599 --> 01:26:31,830
Come to think of it,
Laura was telling me...

677
01:26:32,002 --> 01:26:34,629
that your mother
used to be a little...

678
01:26:40,344 --> 01:26:42,244
Oh, thank you.

679
01:27:11,341 --> 01:27:16,005
You caught me on a bad night. I have
to run, or I'm gonna miss this meeting.

680
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:18,875
- I think I better be going...
- No, no, no. You stay.

681
01:27:19,049 --> 01:27:21,517
Laura, you get him
some of the blueberry muffins.

682
01:27:21,685 --> 01:27:23,812
Did you put the garbage out?

683
01:27:24,187 --> 01:27:26,452
- I'll get it later.
- That's the third night...

684
01:27:26,623 --> 01:27:30,217
I can't think of everything now.
I just can't think of everything.

685
01:27:30,394 --> 01:27:33,624
I've got more important things
on my mind than that garbage.

686
01:27:34,797 --> 01:27:37,232
- Been real nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

687
01:27:37,401 --> 01:27:39,733
Come back real soon,
we'll have a real chat.

688
01:27:39,903 --> 01:27:41,164
Thank you.

689
01:28:12,569 --> 01:28:14,969
Can you imagine that, Vincent?

690
01:28:15,138 --> 01:28:17,071
Me drinking?

691
01:28:21,445 --> 01:28:23,174
Please have one.

692
01:28:45,802 --> 01:28:48,896
Vincent, how did you happen
to stop by tonight?

693
01:28:57,981 --> 01:29:00,609
You never got that clock fixed.

694
01:29:02,386 --> 01:29:04,479
Isn't that funny,
the things you remember?

695
01:29:04,655 --> 01:29:07,283
I thought you'd forgotten
all about me.

696
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:12,155
You see, I wasn't sure how you felt
after Norman and I got married.

697
01:29:13,363 --> 01:29:16,298
I even thought you might be
holding it against me.

698
01:29:18,869 --> 01:29:20,302
Why would I do that?

699
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:28,505
I've been thinking about you.

700
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:34,307
I happened to see you passing by the
other day. I suppose that's the reason.

701
01:29:34,618 --> 01:29:37,587
You were with
a very pretty blond girl.

702
01:29:40,657 --> 01:29:43,592
That's one of the patients.

703
01:29:48,398 --> 01:29:52,391
I'm sure you'll make a great success
of your work, Vincent.

704
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:56,333
I always hoped you'd
find yourself someday.

705
01:30:04,648 --> 01:30:06,775
Vincent, what's the matter?

706
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:11,246
- I'll be running along.
- Vincent.

707
01:30:12,723 --> 01:30:14,248
Do you remember when I said...

708
01:30:14,658 --> 01:30:18,322
l'd never really let you make love
to me untiI I was married?

709
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:21,288
Well, I am married now.

710
01:31:17,422 --> 01:31:20,288
I'm not allowed
to go across the street.

711
01:31:27,799 --> 01:31:31,257
If this was my hoop, I'd put ribbons
in the rim, with little bells.

712
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:35,372
That would be a good idea, lady,
but would it cost a lot?

713
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:38,406
Then I'd have to give you
some money.

714
01:31:38,643 --> 01:31:42,739
We still have some money, don't we,
Vincent? From my allowance?

715
01:31:43,815 --> 01:31:46,477
- How much?
- A dollar.

716
01:31:48,886 --> 01:31:51,854
There you are.
Don't forget, it's just for the bells.

717
01:31:52,022 --> 01:31:53,923
Yes, ma'am, and thank you.

718
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:59,161
I'll come back and see you in a couple
of days. When, Vincent? Thursday?

719
01:32:09,272 --> 01:32:11,332
- What's your name?
- David.

720
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:55,510
Ma'am, I wanna buy this aquarium.

721
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:00,512
There he goes again.

722
01:34:00,685 --> 01:34:04,816
He screamed like that all night. Who is
it that screams like that above me?

723
01:34:05,189 --> 01:34:07,351
It's our friend Mr. Davis, isn't it?

724
01:34:08,125 --> 01:34:12,152
Why don't they do something for him?
You don't know how terrible it is.

725
01:34:13,531 --> 01:34:17,092
- What do you want them to do?
- Kill him.

726
01:34:23,942 --> 01:34:27,673
They're not supposed to kill people
here. They're supposed to cure them.

727
01:34:29,114 --> 01:34:30,705
Are they?

728
01:34:36,654 --> 01:34:38,485
Do you think they can cure Lilith?

729
01:34:44,729 --> 01:34:46,629
Do you know what she wants?

730
01:34:48,366 --> 01:34:51,063
Do you think they can cure this fire?

731
01:34:52,037 --> 01:34:54,095
Do you know
what they have to cure?

732
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:58,972
She wants to leave the mark of her
desire on every creature in the world.

733
01:35:01,812 --> 01:35:05,077
If she were Caesar,
she'd do it with a sword.

734
01:35:05,484 --> 01:35:08,714
If she were a poet,
she'd do it with words.

735
01:35:16,194 --> 01:35:17,956
But she's Lilith.

736
01:35:20,464 --> 01:35:22,932
She has to do it with her body.

737
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:39,208
Your hands are cold.
They feel like death.

738
01:35:55,566 --> 01:35:57,262
Why did you steal my doll?

739
01:35:59,271 --> 01:36:01,796
- What doll?
- You know.

740
01:36:01,973 --> 01:36:03,907
I don't know
what you're talking about.

741
01:36:04,076 --> 01:36:05,976
You're lying.

742
01:36:06,211 --> 01:36:09,839
You say you love me, and you lie.
How can there be trust between us...

743
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:12,711
when you lie to me?
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

744
01:36:12,883 --> 01:36:16,115
- I didn't steal your doll.
- Liar! Liar!

745
01:36:16,288 --> 01:36:18,347
Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar!

746
01:36:21,026 --> 01:36:22,584
Liar!

747
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:30,129
Liar.

748
01:36:33,739 --> 01:36:37,197
I took it because I love you.

749
01:36:43,648 --> 01:36:45,946
Did I show you my paintbox?

750
01:36:46,585 --> 01:36:48,314
My new one?

751
01:36:50,254 --> 01:36:52,223
Don't you think it's beautiful?

752
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:55,657
It was a gift from Ronnie.

753
01:36:59,097 --> 01:37:01,792
Ronnie? Who's Ronnie?

754
01:37:03,602 --> 01:37:05,331
My brother.

755
01:37:10,976 --> 01:37:12,739
Your brother's dead.

756
01:37:15,414 --> 01:37:17,143
Is he?

757
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:20,445
He used to give me things.

758
01:37:21,286 --> 01:37:22,810
Flowers.

759
01:37:24,055 --> 01:37:26,546
There was a rose
in his hand that day.

760
01:37:27,426 --> 01:37:31,123
All the petals
blew away like little flowers.

761
01:37:36,502 --> 01:37:39,129
What did you ever bring me,
Vincent?

762
01:37:46,846 --> 01:37:49,643
I want you to take us out together.

763
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:57,245
His hands are warm...

764
01:37:57,457 --> 01:38:00,152
not cold and dead like yours.

765
01:38:02,594 --> 01:38:04,858
He makes lovely things for me.

766
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:10,200
He's very sweet.

767
01:38:11,369 --> 01:38:13,599
I've been very cruel to him.

768
01:38:16,943 --> 01:38:19,001
Tell me more about your brother.

769
01:38:23,682 --> 01:38:25,274
My brother?

770
01:38:25,751 --> 01:38:27,615
There's nothing to tell.

771
01:38:28,954 --> 01:38:30,615
He's dead.

772
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,422
He asked Miss Brice
to bring it for me.

773
01:38:38,697 --> 01:38:39,959
Who asked Miss Brice?

774
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:47,799
Steven.

775
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:51,774
Steven Evshevsky.
He made it for me for my birthday.

776
01:38:54,646 --> 01:38:56,739
Don't you think that's touching?

777
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,255
You will take us walking tomorrow,
won't you?

778
01:39:12,732 --> 01:39:14,632
You will take us walking.

779
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,358
Won't you?

780
01:39:39,725 --> 01:39:41,089
Good evening.

781
01:39:44,397 --> 01:39:46,092
Won't you sit down?

782
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:07,743
The music's beautiful, isn't it?

783
01:40:14,293 --> 01:40:16,260
You saw Miss Arthur today.

784
01:40:18,898 --> 01:40:22,697
I wonder if she mentioned
the gift that I sent her.

785
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:25,932
Yes, she did.

786
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:30,097
She did? Well, was she...?

787
01:40:31,611 --> 01:40:34,512
Did she seem pleased with it?

788
01:40:37,116 --> 01:40:38,413
She showed it to me.

789
01:40:39,085 --> 01:40:40,745
She showed it to you?

790
01:40:42,221 --> 01:40:44,451
Then she must have been
pleased with it.

791
01:40:45,624 --> 01:40:52,053
You know, I really think she's
beginning to have a feeling for me.

792
01:40:52,231 --> 01:40:54,131
Don't you?

793
01:40:56,802 --> 01:41:02,069
Of all the people here, I think you are
the only one who understands us.

794
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:13,579
How beautiful everything is.

795
01:41:17,323 --> 01:41:20,759
Only last night, this very tree
terrified me.

796
01:41:25,564 --> 01:41:28,431
Do you know I was just
about to destroy this leaf?

797
01:41:30,536 --> 01:41:32,060
To kill it...

798
01:41:33,305 --> 01:41:35,240
just out of happiness.

799
01:41:37,843 --> 01:41:41,779
How careless joy can make us,
and yet how wonderful.

800
01:41:42,715 --> 01:41:45,583
One feels a kind of
heightened sensitivity.

801
01:41:46,819 --> 01:41:49,287
You hear things that
you've never heard before.

802
01:41:49,656 --> 01:41:52,216
You see things that
you've never seen before.

803
01:41:53,693 --> 01:41:55,786
You can feel colors.

804
01:41:57,731 --> 01:42:02,463
That must be what she feels when
she catches the sunlight in her prisms.

805
01:42:06,073 --> 01:42:08,974
How wonderful I feel
when I'm happy.

806
01:42:12,412 --> 01:42:14,311
Do you think that insanity...

807
01:42:15,848 --> 01:42:18,715
could be so simple a thing
as unhappiness?

808
01:42:23,589 --> 01:42:25,716
Maybe it's the other way around.

809
01:42:27,093 --> 01:42:28,617
I don't understand that.

810
01:42:29,762 --> 01:42:31,093
What do you mean?

811
01:42:34,967 --> 01:42:36,798
I don't know what I mean.

812
01:42:39,339 --> 01:42:42,136
Sometimes I just say things.
You shouldn't trust me.

813
01:42:43,109 --> 01:42:44,576
But I do.

814
01:42:46,112 --> 01:42:48,445
Just as I trust the way I feel.

815
01:42:54,019 --> 01:42:56,886
You say she showed you my gift.

816
01:42:58,791 --> 01:43:00,589
Did she say anything about it?

817
01:43:00,761 --> 01:43:02,455
Did she like it?

818
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:06,525
Did she talk about me?

819
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,591
I'd like permission to live
on the grounds.

820
01:44:34,988 --> 01:44:38,287
He got a kitchen knife
from someone.

821
01:44:39,025 --> 01:44:42,483
Held it against his chest and
then fell full-length onto the floor.

822
01:44:42,629 --> 01:44:46,258
- When?
- It must have been about sunrise.

823
01:44:46,433 --> 01:44:49,664
Greta came over to check
when he didn't show at breakfast.

824
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:52,236
Tell him to cover up his hands.

825
01:44:53,473 --> 01:44:56,067
He didn't like people
to see his fingers.

826
01:45:09,022 --> 01:45:11,582
What is it? Mother here?

827
01:45:12,259 --> 01:45:13,657
I saw the ambulance.

828
01:45:13,827 --> 01:45:15,454
I was watching from my window.

829
01:45:16,096 --> 01:45:19,691
They came to get my brother,
didn't they? They've taken him away.

830
01:45:19,866 --> 01:45:21,458
I saw them. I saw the ambulance.

831
01:45:21,635 --> 01:45:24,798
They took him out on a stretcher,
covered with a white blanket.

832
01:45:24,971 --> 01:45:26,529
It was Steven.

833
01:45:29,009 --> 01:45:30,772
Steven?

834
01:45:35,949 --> 01:45:37,246
- You're lying to me.
- No.

835
01:45:37,417 --> 01:45:40,181
- Why are you always lying to me?
- I'm not lying.

836
01:45:41,688 --> 01:45:44,316
You mean that gentleman
with the lovely hands...

837
01:45:44,491 --> 01:45:46,618
who made me my paintbox?

838
01:45:48,261 --> 01:45:50,388
Have I shown you my paintbox?

839
01:45:52,432 --> 01:45:54,525
And you were going
to take us walking.

840
01:45:54,701 --> 01:45:56,362
- No.
- You said in a couple days...

841
01:45:56,536 --> 01:45:58,231
we could go walking.

842
01:45:58,405 --> 01:46:02,273
You don't know what I've done.
He killed himself.

843
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:05,906
He's dead.

844
01:46:15,455 --> 01:46:17,480
No, I don't know what you're saying.

845
01:46:18,725 --> 01:46:21,353
I don't understand
what you're saying.

846
01:46:25,732 --> 01:46:27,860
You shouldn't say
such terrible things.

847
01:46:28,034 --> 01:46:30,161
You're lying if you say those things.

848
01:46:30,337 --> 01:46:32,362
I did the right thing.

849
01:46:33,374 --> 01:46:36,001
You wanted me to do that.
Say that.

850
01:46:38,411 --> 01:46:40,937
That isn't why they die.

851
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:45,481
Just say I did the right thing.

852
01:46:48,522 --> 01:46:50,148
Tell me that.

853
01:46:50,324 --> 01:46:52,314
Say you wanted me to do it.

854
01:46:53,994 --> 01:46:56,485
I don't kill the things I love.

855
01:46:57,364 --> 01:46:59,332
I didn't kill my brother.

856
01:47:00,935 --> 01:47:02,526
He jumped.

857
01:47:05,138 --> 01:47:08,335
He jumped because he
didn't dare to love me.

858
01:47:10,243 --> 01:47:12,007
And I wanted him to.

859
01:47:18,051 --> 01:47:20,042
I wanted him to.

860
01:47:26,594 --> 01:47:28,390
What else you wanna know,
doctor?

861
01:47:28,561 --> 01:47:32,759
You always want me to tell you things.
Don't you know enough, doctor?

862
01:47:36,803 --> 01:47:38,931
I'm Vincent.

863
01:47:40,607 --> 01:47:42,132
Vincent?

864
01:47:48,214 --> 01:47:50,148
Leave me alone, please.

865
01:47:52,887 --> 01:47:55,855
Leave me alone. Please.

866
01:48:09,837 --> 01:48:11,236
Vincent?

867
01:48:31,124 --> 01:48:32,489
Vincent?

868
01:48:35,329 --> 01:48:36,887
Vincent?

869
01:49:44,498 --> 01:49:46,363
Hi.

870
01:49:47,001 --> 01:49:49,231
- Drinking?
- Sure.

871
01:49:49,570 --> 01:49:52,198
Only it's on me.
I owe you a binge.

872
01:49:52,573 --> 01:49:54,768
Scotch, water on the side.

873
01:49:56,777 --> 01:49:58,802
Scotch, blood on the side.

874
01:50:07,755 --> 01:50:10,816
If you're in a rocket ship,
you can shoot right back at them.

875
01:50:11,792 --> 01:50:13,760
They disintegrate.

876
01:50:15,162 --> 01:50:17,562
You're gonna be alone
in space, you know.

877
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:23,637
Space, all alone.

878
01:50:27,441 --> 01:50:29,136
I don't know which is right.

879
01:50:50,097 --> 01:50:52,692
Yellow hair, yellow ribbon.

880
01:51:04,144 --> 01:51:07,376
This one's for you, bitch.

881
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,831
Help me.
