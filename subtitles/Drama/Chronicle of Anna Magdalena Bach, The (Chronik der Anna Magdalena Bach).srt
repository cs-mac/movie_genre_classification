1
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,280
"On the 16th, when we stood aproximately
on 58 degree of southern latidude,

2
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,460
the sea shone at night, which,

3
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,299
on account of the high degree of latidude
and the cold temperature in the sky,

4
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,339
struck us as curious,

5
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,300
although that glowing therein was visible
merely within single sparks.

6
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,660
At noon, the thermometer
climbed up to 33,5 degrees Celsius.

7
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,100
There were strong winds
across this entire area

8
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,499
We saw lots of seaweed,
foremost rocktop,

9
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,979
a huge amount of petrels and shearwaters,
and else seabirds.

10
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,040
Amongst the latter, we were amused
by some of big gray seagulls,

11
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,619
when they were hunting
a big, white albatross."

12
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:41,975
Jakob!

13
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,739
"Despite of his long wings
he could not escape them."

14
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,409
Jakob!

15
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,499
"They tried to get to him from below,
towards his belly, where he..."

16
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:54,703
Give me that book!

17
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,914
- Lazy boy, I'll teach him what work is!
- I didn't hear you.

18
00:01:58,043 --> 00:01:59,408
- Come out of here!
- Jakob!

19
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:00,909
Get out of here!

20
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:03,128
- Give me the book.
- Give me the book.

21
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,372
- I didn't hear you.
- Come out of there!

22
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:06,795
Not the book, father.

23
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,299
You rascal, next time I catch you skiving,
I'll break your neck!

24
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,597
Give me that book!

25
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:21,058
- Jakob!
- As long as you live under my roof,

26
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,102
you do as I say.

27
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:24,600
Where are you going?

28
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,487
And you always stick up for the lout!

29
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,578
Trouble and strife all day...

30
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:51,969
Thinks he's an Indian himself,
the halfwit!

31
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:41,685
HOME FROM HOME

32
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:47,650
Chronicle of a Vision

33
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,719
Uncle!

34
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:00,531
What is it?

35
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,155
On this,

36
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:26,109
the first day of April

37
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:30,490
in the year 1842,

38
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,457
in Schabbach,

39
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:40,374
commenced his journal

40
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,219
Jakob Adam Simon,

41
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:48,549
son of the master blacksmith
Johann Simon

42
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:51,928
and his wedded wife Margarethe,
my dearly beloved mother,

43
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:56,185
spurred by the promptings of my heart
to explore the world

44
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,568
as it is described in books

45
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:03,189
and in the records
left by intrepid travelers,

46
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:07,067
chiefly for the sake of the languages of
faraway peoples which I intend to study.

47
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:10,992
The moon is full,
that's why you can't sleep.

48
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,827
It's all right, grandmother.

49
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,292
Be careful what you dream.

50
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:20,289
Dreams have a way of
coming true one day.

51
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:27,845
This is my vowed intent

52
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,392
to entrust to this book

53
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:37,852
each of my steps
and earnest resolutions,

54
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:45,197
until I stand at the edge of the great ocean
that will bear me to the New World.

55
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:55,198
In the night,
slumber has often forsaken me,

56
00:08:56,461 --> 00:09:00,375
and in my mind's eye
I see the multitude of men and women,

57
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,919
servant girls, children and youths

58
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,220
who have abandoned their homes
in these years.

59
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,720
In long battalions their pilgrim shadows
wend their way to the surging waves

60
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,517
that will take them out
to the New World.

61
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:23,147
But why,
asks my pining heart,

62
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,572
why leave home for ever?

63
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:31,284
The hardship that besets us
will surely relent,

64
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:34,530
and rarely does good fortune
smile on the exiles.

65
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,743
Why do all these wagons
stand heavy-laden,

66
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,042
outward-bound in the lanes
and farmyards of the Rhineland,

67
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:47,259
the Palatinate, nay,
so rumor has it, all over Europe.

68
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:54,974
This is it then.

69
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:57,595
The Kuhn brothers are emigrating.

70
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,598
All three of them.

71
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:06,569
Many retire for the night irresolute and
swear that they will stay for the duration,

72
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:13,945
only to awake determined to tear up
their roots that very same day

73
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,947
and follow the call of the times,

74
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,247
a call stronger than all our resolve.

75
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,586
The Lord bless you and keep you.

76
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:27,423
The Lord make his face shine upon you
and be gracious to you.

77
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,677
The Lord lift up his countenance upon you
and give you peace.

78
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:35,303
God bless you, amen.

79
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,104
Our Father,
which art in Heaven,

80
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:47,022
hallowed be Thy name,

81
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:50,193
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

82
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:52,315
in earth as it is in Heaven.

83
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,693
Give us our daily bread

84
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:56,820
and forgive us our trespasses,

85
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,913
as we forgive them
that trespass against us...

86
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,350
These are the last.

87
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,606
Just imagine, mother,

88
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:38,366
over there the fields are
five hundred times bigger than here,

89
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,535
and there is no winter.

90
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:48,755
They can harvest corn,
maize and wheat twice a year.

91
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,175
On the Rio Grande!

92
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:56,172
The biggest forest is in the north.

93
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:02,015
It's not just hundred, it's thousand times
bigger than the whole Hunsrück!

94
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:09,813
Where do you get it from, Jakob?

95
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:15,068
It makes me come over all funny
when I look in your eyes.

96
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:19,361
There's something in
those eyes of yours, Jakob...

97
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,622
I don't know where it comes from.

98
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,627
It's just from a few books, mother.

99
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:30,247
There are hundreds of them,
thousands.

100
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,373
No, Jakob.

101
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:36,219
You've always been different,
even when you were small.

102
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:39,722
Always staring into the distance.

103
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,263
Gran said,

104
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,018
be careful he doesn't die young,

105
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:50,313
gazing into the other world like that.

106
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:53,027
Father doesn't see it that way.

107
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,418
With this hymn
we welcome the spring in a year

108
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,969
that with God's help
will bring us the just reward

109
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:23,012
for all the hard work
of the last years: a rich harvest.

110
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:29,139
It's God's will that the lean years
will be followed by the fat years.

111
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:33,651
We look back on seven years of hardship,
poor harvests, darkness

112
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,774
and the deaths
of many of our little children.

113
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:45,406
Some of us have understood the hymn:
"Go seek my heart the joys of life"

114
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:50,206
as an injunction to seek their fortune
on the other side of the ocean.

115
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:56,963
But even in Brazil, God's paradise
is not merely there for the asking!

116
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,797
The paths of destiny are legion,
and I shall follow their beckoning

117
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:06,769
when once my brother Gustav shall return
from His Majesty's infantry in Wesel,

118
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:12,016
where he acquits his military service
as a hoof-smith for the dragoons.

119
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,643
For the greater glory
of that Prussian king

120
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,487
so oblivious and unmindful
of his subjects!

121
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:21,324
There is a better cause
that I can serve.

122
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:22,817
It's name is Liberty!

123
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:26,322
Hence my resolve,
before the year is out,

124
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:29,449
to turn my back on
this faithless homeland

125
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:33,829
that has nothing but servitude to offer
to its children and to go in quest

126
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:40,211
that realm of dreams described
in so many books and travelogues.

127
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:42,063
They're all in church.

128
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:45,195
It's so nice to have you back, Gustav.

129
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:49,787
Good day, Gran.

130
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:55,498
I'm so tired.

131
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,745
Go ahead and sleep.

132
00:15:57,882 --> 00:15:59,714
You're home now.

133
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:17,310
Uncle.

134
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,777
Uncle!

135
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:27,780
- Uncle, Gustav's home.
- Yes, yes.

136
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:31,155
The time has come.
It's the end of the world.

137
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,156
But not for me.

138
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:37,331
It's in my sister's will.

139
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:42,879
And she shook Napoleon by the hand
and knitted a bit of his shroud!

140
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,342
- And the awful hunger...
- Ah, yes.

141
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,965
Hunger came with the false emperor.

142
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:52,342
But the Swedes couldn't frighten us.

143
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,266
We were too tough for them
here in Schabbach.

144
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:57,389
But that was 200 years ago, Uncle.

145
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:01,735
When the world ends,
it'll be on a Sunday.

146
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:04,354
When they're all in church.

147
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,279
- Mark my words!
- Listen, Uncle!

148
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:09,993
Gustav is home.

149
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:12,579
When they're all in church.

150
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:16,415
And God in heaven
can look down on them all.

151
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:21,289
- He never forgets. The day of reckoning!
- He's right there in the kitchen.

152
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,540
Uncle, they're waiting for us.

153
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,418
Jakob, does your father
still make your life a misery?

154
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:27,840
It's time to go home.

155
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:32,557
<i>When the Republic
comes marching down the hill</i>

156
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,101
<i>The rascals</i>

157
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:38,187
<i>In their palaces</i>

158
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:41,353
<i>Will have to pay the bill</i>

159
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:45,941
<i>They'll all cough up
until they cough up blood!</i>

160
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:52,076
Jakob, when you go to the Indians,
can I come too?

161
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,194
Yes, for sure.

162
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,742
- And will you teach me to read?
- Yes.

163
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,288
And then we can read
all those books I hid for you.

164
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,252
Yes, I promise.

165
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:08,381
<i>When the Republic
Comes marching down the hill...</i>

166
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:25,811
Come here, Margot,
say good-day to Gustav.

167
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,813
He was nearly two years in the army.

168
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,122
Margot!

169
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:46,248
You backhanded halfvvit!
You little fiend! You ugly cripple!

170
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,416
Stupid creature that you are!

171
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,178
You're the Devil's work
and no mistake!

172
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,135
With your club foot...!

173
00:18:56,435 --> 00:19:00,804
Satan is your father,
we've always known.

174
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,147
My father died in the war!

175
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,188
What war'? Napoleon's?

176
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,652
There was no sign of you then.

177
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,909
It's good you're back.

178
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:26,204
Things will be better now.

179
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,641
Attention!

180
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,778
Jakob, old lad.
You held the fort while I was gone?

181
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,731
You've grown.

182
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:56,029
The villagers call him the Indian.

183
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,333
Where's Lena then?

184
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:13,050
Has anything happened to her?

185
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:20,049
Your sister married a Mosel man.

186
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,972
A strapping fellow he is.

187
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:27,857
Protestant or Catholic,
character is the main thing!

188
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,397
She lives in Wolf an der Mosel,

189
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,987
her husband is
a winegrower called Zeitz.

190
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:35,982
You won't know him.

191
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:43,574
And that little Catholic bastard
in her oven has no place here.

192
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,245
- Am I right?
- You are.

193
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,165
- Smearcase cheese for supper!
- Fold your hands.

194
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,971
All eyes are raised to thee, O Lord,

195
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,716
For Thou shalt feed us
when the time is come,

196
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:06,312
The fullness of Thy hands
pours blessings on all creatures.

197
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,684
Amen.

198
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:51,858
The Cayucachua believe that
it brings misfortune, hing-ti-tuyu,

199
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:55,728
to speak of things long past
or yet to come.

200
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:58,484
If they do so,

201
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,575
they either refrain from
any reference to time at all

202
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:04,162
or the so-called ancestral tense.

203
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,748
Only the native Indians
are permitted to use this form

204
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:12,211
because it is also the tense in which
their sacred narratives are couched.

205
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:17,462
For example:
"Place where the sun rises",

206
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:19,589
kla-kulo.

207
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:26,073
Come on, I'll show you.

208
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:31,119
It's good for it to be wet. Come on.

209
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,599
Listen, will it really help?
Do you swear?

210
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,934
On anything you like.

211
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,181
I've tried it myself.
All the sores were gone by nightfall.

212
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:56,231
Look.

213
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,944
Come on, we have to undress.
And sing that song.

214
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,813
<i>It is cold.</i>

215
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:03,485
It has to be.

216
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:06,530
Can you remember the words?

217
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>We won't go home, we won't go home,
We won't go home no more</i>

218
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:16,789
<i>Till all the nasty scabs are gone
And no more sores on hands or bum</i>

219
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,664
<i>We won't go home no more</i>

220
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,044
<i>Three, two one, the spell is done,
and soon the scurf will all be gone</i>

221
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:44,154
Know what I was thinking of?

222
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,317
A handsome prince.

223
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,451
With a little todger hanging down.

224
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:02,631
- No looking! Turn your back!
- Turn around, I say!

225
00:25:20,611 --> 00:25:22,522
All right, you can look now.

226
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,612
- Will you tell on us?
- No, never!

227
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:31,532
- Never?
- Never and a day.

228
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:36,077
She has this rash on her arms.
It won't go away.

229
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,256
Look what I found. It's a wing feather
from a falco rusticolus islandus,

230
00:25:43,383 --> 00:25:45,169
up on Soon Hill.

231
00:25:45,886 --> 00:25:48,002
- You can have it, if you like.
- It's pretty.

232
00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:50,838
Is it a love story?

233
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:54,683
- No, it's about the tropics.
- Tropics?

234
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:56,301
Is that an illness?

235
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,772
The tropics are a place where...

236
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:07,689
at midday the shadow of your head
falls right on your feet.

237
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:14,078
Tropics...

238
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:19,079
Florine, you're a barmy.
Wait for me!

239
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,952
The tropics...

240
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:27,837
You can keep it.

241
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:29,585
It's pretty.

242
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,799
- Rusticulus oswaldus romandus.
- No, falco rusticolus islandus.

243
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:37,802
From the high north.
A gyrfalcon.

244
00:26:37,938 --> 00:26:41,476
The Cayucachlilas call it kl-u-i-kl.

245
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:44,271
But they have lots of other birds
that are much more colorful.

246
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,274
You can't imagine what the birds
in South America look like.

247
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,399
Some are the size of wasps.
Others are as big...

248
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:53,901
as big...

249
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:56,199
as big as you are!

250
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:58,538
The condor, say, or the pelican.

251
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:16,258
Florine, you are barmy!
Wait for me!

252
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:22,013
You're barmy!

253
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,318
Equally uncongenial was
our first encounter with sand fleas.

254
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:40,285
These insects sought out
our heels and toes

255
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:43,626
and deposited their unhatched offspring
under the skin.

256
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:45,995
Jakob!

257
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,341
Now you're in for it!

258
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,627
Come out of here!

259
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:59,718
Shamming! Lying!
Get into the smithy!

260
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:01,719
Give me that book!

261
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,272
- Finished?
- Yes, we're finished.

262
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,302
Shouldn't we be glad that
the boy has learned so much?

263
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:40,765
What's he learned?
Nothing useful!

264
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:43,352
Two left hands
and lazier than a dead bat.

265
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,346
I wish I could read books.

266
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:48,691
No, mother. Father's right,
I'm no good for anything.

267
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:51,686
We all have to earn our bread.
Look at your brother!

268
00:28:52,322 --> 00:28:53,687
Am I right, Gustav?

269
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:25,093
Florine!

270
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:31,562
Florine, where are you?

271
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:47,917
No one could see us now
if we took all our clothes off.

272
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:50,081
I don't need to. Look!

273
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:53,876
Not one little pimple left!

274
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:57,964
- Not even a scar on your fingers.
- It did help.

275
00:29:59,973 --> 00:30:02,431
But we can still
take our clothes off, right?

276
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,597
I'd die if someone saw us.

277
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:07,936
You mean if the Indian comes.

278
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:12,099
Or the prince.

279
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:20,817
<i>The wolf prowls through
the tall, tall grass</i>

280
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:26,368
<i>Across the muddy ground</i>

281
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:34,998
<i>And sinks his fangs in little lass</i>

282
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:41,592
<i>Before she can look round</i>

283
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,387
Florine... there!

284
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:48,678
It is a prince!

285
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:46,326
Are you familiar with the area?

286
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:04,761
Ah, you took the short cut
over Koppenstein hill.

287
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,927
All rocks and granite...
Napoleon came a cropper up there.

288
00:32:08,435 --> 00:32:09,925
Yes and no.

289
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,426
- Nauert?
- Yes?

290
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,804
Come here.
Take a look at this.

291
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,432
- Gustav!
- Your services are no longer required.

292
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:17,558
Here.

293
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,523
A token of my gratitude.

294
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:38,461
They need a hand.

295
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,047
It's the young baron from Gmünden.

296
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:49,758
Look after the horses
before your father gets nasty again.

297
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:05,731
Aren't you girls from the gemstone mill
near Kirchwiller?

298
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:09,576
Henriette is. I'm from Morsch's tannery
down near Fischbach.

299
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,658
Aha.

300
00:33:17,504 --> 00:33:18,960
Did it help?

301
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:40,273
See you around, maybe.

302
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:42,518
- She's still got that feather.
- Hush!

303
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:55,998
The baron, your uncle,
did you drop him off at Kreuznach?

304
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:59,084
- No, he sent me there...
- I see.

305
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:01,544
...because his lady wife
is taking the waters.

306
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:05,382
I see. It fits.

307
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,841
- Now it fits.
- Yes, it fits.

308
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,870
Right up your street, eh?
Better than hard work in the smithy.

309
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:48,008
Can you understand that?

310
00:34:48,678 --> 00:34:49,793
<i>Yes.</i>

311
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,386
It's Spanish.

312
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,643
It means something like...

313
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:04,854
"in the night after
I had spoken with him

314
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:08,399
"came a strong wind
and blew so hard

315
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:11,193
"that part of the roof flew away."

316
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:17,280
The savages were angry with me.
Lingua...

317
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:22,706
In their language they said:
Hua-ka-atra-aku. Sti-she santi-kulu hem.

318
00:35:23,796 --> 00:35:26,288
That's Xancaréu dialect

319
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:29,249
and means...

320
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:34,550
"The evil one, the medicine man
has made the wind come."

321
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:37,307
He meant the book I was holding.

322
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:49,065
You're quite a wizard, eh?

323
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,120
Nice and slow, my pretty one,

324
00:35:59,249 --> 00:36:01,741
otherwise we'll make sausage out of you.

325
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:03,492
And slow.

326
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,914
And what does this mean?

327
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:08,292
That's English.

328
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:14,011
"In earlier issues
we published some news

329
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:19,133
"on the state of the slaves
in the plantations..."

330
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:20,759
Jakob!

331
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:23,603
- Oh, it's my father.
- Where are you skulking?

332
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:41,121
That'll be six florins.
The wheel is better than it was before.

333
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,127
What I say is true.

334
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,221
Keep it for me till the next time.

335
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:05,849
It's all Greek to me.

336
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,171
Father!

337
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:41,973
Father!

338
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,606
Have you heard?

339
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,197
Florine's brothers
are going abroad, too.

340
00:37:59,118 --> 00:38:01,610
I know what you're thinking.

341
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:06,123
But don't worry your head.
I'll stay with you.

342
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:10,210
With your mother.

343
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:13,672
Otherwise you wouldn't have anyone
who understands you.

344
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:18,255
Don't worry your head.

345
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:51,914
And I haven't got a sweetheart either...

346
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:00,460
What are you thinking?

347
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,448
Lovely.

348
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:27,912
So far away.

349
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:32,454
It's endless.

350
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:36,875
You could lose yourself in it for ever.

351
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:41,085
Across the sea and out yonder.

352
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,132
It's like the sky.

353
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:47,762
It never ends.

354
00:39:50,313 --> 00:39:51,803
Paradise.

355
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:22,383
Often, when we were children,
my brother Gustav, three years my elder,

356
00:40:22,512 --> 00:40:26,506
had to take me by the hand and guide me
through our village when it was dark.

357
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:32,015
Who cannot see must have
the world in his head, he would say.

358
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:35,355
All he meant was the position of
the houses and the holes in the road,

359
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:37,190
so as not to fall into them.

360
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,111
What I say is that the whole world
is a dark place

361
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:46,029
that has to be lit up in our minds

362
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,323
so we can find our way around in it
at night, like natives.

363
00:40:49,455 --> 00:40:51,787
Beware of that ferret!

364
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,328
Its nest is right where your bed is.

365
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,418
And are not such wise people
to be found everywhere?

366
00:40:57,547 --> 00:41:01,757
And can we not solicit their guidance
once we have learned their languages

367
00:41:01,884 --> 00:41:03,716
and know the names they give to things?

368
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:16,888
How to address members of a tribe.

369
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:18,389
Example:

370
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:22,190
"The Chieftain speaks to
the woman great with child",

371
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:26,030
Tamjuk vatuksh-talem Hanya Ktekel.

372
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:29,696
Or, "The woman great with child
speaks to the chieftain",

373
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:33,663
Tamyuk himya takel
Sikta tuk chat yokel.

374
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,498
Nota bene,

375
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:39,961
all members of a tribe and all strangers
would use the first form of address.

376
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:44,299
By so doing, they express the veneration
in which they hold the chieftain.

377
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:19,376
My mother can neither read
nor write like all

378
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:24,213
who toil to earn a living from the soil
like many generations before her.

379
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:27,459
She protected me.

380
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:29,757
As we say in our language:

381
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:31,505
she was my soul's ease.

382
00:42:32,892 --> 00:42:35,759
Often I half believed
I could fly like a bird,

383
00:42:35,895 --> 00:42:38,102
but she never laughed me to scorn.

384
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,561
Instead, she exhorted me

385
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,560
not to let the envious derision
of my detractors clip my wings.

386
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,240
Thanks to her wisdom
I have evaded the snares

387
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:53,360
laid by them
whose feet stick to the ground.

388
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,561
- These are the big ones.
- Good.

389
00:44:03,566 --> 00:44:06,103
We're digging potatoes.

390
00:44:13,576 --> 00:44:16,159
How stupid do you think I am?

391
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,906
Johann, don't do it!

392
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,701
- Johann!
- Not even the press gang would take you!

393
00:44:25,212 --> 00:44:27,078
Get out of my sight!

394
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:30,252
Trying to hoodwink me like that!

395
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,803
Our Indian!
You won't catch him!

396
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:38,139
I'll teach you what work is.

397
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:40,099
With a cudgel, if need be!

398
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:57,593
Fürchtegott!

399
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,801
Fürchtegott!

400
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,949
Have you seen my husband?

401
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,535
No. No one's been here.

402
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:25,325
Fürchtegott Niem
from the gemstone mill in Kirchwiller.

403
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,074
He's not been home all night.

404
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:30,869
Help me look for him, please!

405
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,249
I know Henriette, your daughter.

406
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:52,106
Is that your husband?

407
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,896
Fürchtegott!

408
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:57,775
Come out of the water!

409
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,940
Fürchtegott!

410
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,278
Come.

411
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,249
Hold the wheel, would you?

412
00:47:10,377 --> 00:47:12,288
Here I am. Yes.

413
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:18,090
Come on, Mr Niem.

414
00:47:39,531 --> 00:47:41,021
Fürchtegott?

415
00:47:56,006 --> 00:48:00,375
My husband stopped talking
twelve years ago.

416
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:03,798
He's not said a word since.

417
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,181
Twelve years!

418
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:12,304
Would you credit it?

419
00:48:43,012 --> 00:48:47,176
Henriette's not here.
She's never here when I need her.

420
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:50,346
Probably hanging around with
that friend of hers from the sinky tannery.

421
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,344
It wouldn't kill her to give me a hand.

422
00:48:54,857 --> 00:48:56,473
Are you hungry?

423
00:48:57,318 --> 00:48:58,683
You must be.

424
00:49:02,156 --> 00:49:04,022
That's all I can give you.

425
00:49:05,534 --> 00:49:07,195
Put it in there.

426
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,825
Times are hard.

427
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:17,868
Much obliged.

428
00:49:28,223 --> 00:49:30,134
I will need to speak of hardship.

429
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:33,968
I have legs to take me
as far as I would go,

430
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:37,472
instead of abiding
and obeying and keep in the peace.

431
00:49:38,734 --> 00:49:43,228
When I set out one day
to lay eyes on the New World,

432
00:49:43,364 --> 00:49:47,483
I shall not take toils with me
like all the others,

433
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,986
encumbered with their provisions
and utensils, even their bedsteads

434
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,078
and their chamber pots.

435
00:49:53,832 --> 00:49:56,745
How benighted is
their vision of the New World!

436
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:59,915
We should not seek to make it
a rehearsal of our distress

437
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:02,960
but a reflection of our dreams.

438
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:06,505
I shall take nothing with me
but the knowledge of all those

439
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:10,471
who have gone this way before me and
recorded in books what has befallen them.

440
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:15,806
For all can be lost, sent plunging down
to the depths by some tempest.

441
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:18,600
But not what we know in our hearts.

442
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:30,366
<i>Johnny, Johnny, come with me</i>

443
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:33,532
<i>Brazil's the place we're off to see</i>

444
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:36,656
<i>A land so big, a land so free</i>

445
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:40,001
<i>With taters the size of a giant's knee</i>

446
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:43,667
<i>Where every day you can kill a pig</i>

447
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:47,167
<i>And wash it down with a deep long swig</i>

448
00:50:47,302 --> 00:50:54,516
<i>And all the pots are much too small
for trotters, liver, innards and all</i>

449
00:50:54,643 --> 00:51:02,767
<i>So Johnny Johnny, don '1' delay,
your fortune 's just a step away</i>

450
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:03,891
Gentlemen!

451
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:07,353
The likeness of the gracious Emperor.

452
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:11,153
And here a parrot from Brazil.

453
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:16,496
From Brazil, my friends. A parrot.
Brazil is paradise on earth.

454
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:21,956
No ice in Brazil, no snow.

455
00:51:22,087 --> 00:51:23,623
None of your cold winters.

456
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:27,499
Plenty to eat,
the land of the eternal sun.

457
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:31,548
Many before you have grown rich in Brazil.
And so can you.

458
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,173
Do you understand?
Good fortune awaits you there.

459
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:40,811
<i>Welcome, spake the emperor</i>

460
00:51:40,939 --> 00:51:43,897
<i>I bid you welcome all</i>

461
00:51:44,026 --> 00:51:46,984
<i>For I would wish to share with you</i>

462
00:51:47,112 --> 00:51:50,355
<i>The bounty in my thrall</i>

463
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:53,609
<i>Fear not, my hand will keep you</i>

464
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:56,702
<i>From harm and from ill-will</i>

465
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,868
<i>When once you are my subjects</i>

466
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,992
<i>In the fair land of Brazil</i>

467
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,298
<i>Fear not, my hand will keep you</i>

468
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,339
<i>From harm and from ill-will</i>

469
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:15,338
<i>When once you are my subjects</i>

470
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:18,432
<i>In the fair land of Brazil</i>

471
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:28,142
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

472
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:32,112
Today not only the wine is free.

473
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,781
The Emperor of Brazil

474
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:39,495
offers every settler
four hundred acres of land,

475
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,955
a yearly salary of two thousand gulden,

476
00:52:42,084 --> 00:52:44,997
twelve slaves, a house,

477
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:47,369
ten head of cattle and ten pigs.

478
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:50,919
For skilled craftsmen
the passage is free.

479
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:54,510
For their families
it costs next to nothing.

480
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,424
Here are the papers.

481
00:52:56,557 --> 00:52:58,798
Sign your name
and make your fortune!

482
00:53:16,618 --> 00:53:18,825
Lots of old people.

483
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,044
- One or two will sign.
- One or two?

484
00:53:29,631 --> 00:53:32,248
- Not many.
- You know how it is.

485
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:50,475
We'd go to Rio de Janeiro like a shot.
But we come from a Hunsrück tannery.

486
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:53,729
And if we can't make ends meet here,

487
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:57,573
what chance is there for us in Brazil?

488
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:01,069
In Rio the demand for leather goods
is 200 times higher than it is here,

489
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:04,868
but there are only a tenth as many tanners
well-versed in their trade.

490
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,365
Tell us another one!

491
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:14,548
Our trading house Delrue in Bruges
is your warranty.

492
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:18,587
Looking around the room,
I can see what you're thinking.

493
00:54:19,931 --> 00:54:22,548
After the poor harvests, the levies,

494
00:54:22,684 --> 00:54:25,472
the drudgery in the army
and the despotism of your masters

495
00:54:25,604 --> 00:54:28,562
you say to yourselves:
Any fate is better than death.

496
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,272
Huh? Am I right?

497
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,937
And what is better than death?

498
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,607
A good life, a better life!

499
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:39,983
And that is what our trading house Delrue
offers you.

500
00:54:40,118 --> 00:54:44,908
Our secretary
Antonio Alvares de Mirandan Varejao

501
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,953
has negotiated these contracts
personally with the Brazilian president

502
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:53,046
Aureliano de Souza e Oliveiro Coutinho

503
00:54:53,173 --> 00:54:58,213
and his minister Aranje Ribeiro
has signed and sealed them.

504
00:54:59,638 --> 00:55:03,677
Antonio Alvares de Mirandan Varejao,

505
00:55:05,477 --> 00:55:08,890
Aureliano de Souza Coutinho,

506
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,557
minister Aranje Ribeiro...

507
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:16,360
All those names make my head spin.

508
00:55:16,488 --> 00:55:24,953
<i>If we wear red or yellow tunics,
hats or helmets, boots or shoes</i>

509
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,540
<i>If we sew woman’s dresses
or put curls into their tresses</i>

510
00:55:29,668 --> 00:55:34,128
<i>It makes no odds,
we've nothing more to lose</i>

511
00:55:34,256 --> 00:55:38,591
<i>If we sew woman's dresses
or put curls into their tresses</i>

512
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,304
<i>It makes no odds,
we've nothing more to lose</i>

513
00:55:43,432 --> 00:55:45,014
Hey, comrade,
won't you come with us?

514
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:48,600
- Me?
- Yes, you! Come on!

515
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:49,969
But where are you going?

516
00:55:50,105 --> 00:55:53,848
<i>We're on our way, we're on our way</i>

517
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:57,397
<i>To topple the king in Mainz</i>

518
00:55:57,529 --> 00:56:00,772
<i>Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah</i>

519
00:56:00,907 --> 00:56:04,741
<i>Then we're off to America!</i>

520
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,282
My sister lives on the way to Mainz!

521
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:08,779
Down the hatch!

522
00:56:18,467 --> 00:56:20,754
Freedom lives!

523
00:56:21,636 --> 00:56:23,718
Five years in jail
for each of these books,

524
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,804
if they catch you with them.

525
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:31,056
"An execrable civilization,

526
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:35,557
"adding that most despicable
and corruptible of all aristocracies,

527
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,649
"the moneyed class,

528
00:56:37,778 --> 00:56:42,067
"to inherited nobility

529
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:48,866
"and making a horde of fawning
sycophants into rulers of the nation...

530
00:56:49,831 --> 00:56:54,041
"But the revolutions were not long
in exercising that devil."

531
00:57:05,263 --> 00:57:07,755
Hold up! Put ashore!

532
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:11,012
Are you deaf? That's an order!

533
00:57:11,645 --> 00:57:14,979
<i>Rise up, German brothers,
the fatherland's at stake</i>

534
00:57:15,106 --> 00:57:18,599
<i>It's the rights of man we fight for,
and the citizens we smite for</i>

535
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:22,569
<i>Slaves we shall never be
in the republic of the free...</i>

536
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,949
Up there in the sunshine
of earthly bliss,

537
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:29,865
I saw huge venomous plants

538
00:57:31,498 --> 00:57:34,957
rearing up from swamp and sludge...

539
00:57:39,506 --> 00:57:41,088
Dismount!

540
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:45,255
...bloated leeches,

541
00:57:46,346 --> 00:57:50,340
institutions masquerading
<i>as</i> havens of liberalism

542
00:57:50,475 --> 00:57:53,763
but merely serving to bemantle

543
00:57:53,895 --> 00:57:57,138
the excesses of royalty and the rich...

544
00:58:17,544 --> 00:58:22,334
I have severed the cord that
binds me to the world of my parents.

545
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,378
Adieu, comrade! Bonne chance!

546
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,844
My journey to liberty begins with
a new way of regarding things.

547
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,886
I have banished familiar things
to the outer regions.

548
00:58:33,018 --> 00:58:35,885
My eyes are blessed with
this acuity of vision

549
00:58:36,021 --> 00:58:40,060
because they have glimpsed the liberty
I cherish deep in my heart.

550
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:45,482
Wolf an der Mosel,
the tenth day of September,1842,

551
00:58:45,614 --> 00:58:48,151
on my way to my sister Lena's house.

552
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,891
You must tell me all the news, Jakob.

553
00:59:18,146 --> 00:59:20,638
How you hurt your arm.

554
00:59:25,278 --> 00:59:27,394
How things are with father and mother.

555
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:31,615
And in Schabbach.

556
00:59:40,627 --> 00:59:42,994
And why father will not relent.

557
00:59:51,137 --> 00:59:53,219
It makes me all daft in the head.

558
01:00:06,945 --> 01:00:10,188
It's not my baby's fault
that her father's a Catholic.

559
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:17,444
I have disowned my parents.

560
01:00:22,794 --> 01:00:24,705
What are you saying?

561
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:31,083
No one disowns his parents.

562
01:00:35,348 --> 01:00:37,589
And you're mother's favourite.

563
01:00:47,986 --> 01:00:50,068
Jakob, you're safe here with me.

564
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:00,450
I never thought to have you here...

565
01:01:05,545 --> 01:01:07,627
never in all my life.

566
01:03:28,646 --> 01:03:30,182
Uncle?

567
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:39,062
Uncle?

568
01:04:00,845 --> 01:04:02,210
What's wrong?

569
01:04:09,354 --> 01:04:10,344
It's Uncle...

570
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:07,901
Chick, chick, chick...

571
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:35,144
I'll get round the back of him.

572
01:05:35,273 --> 01:05:37,731
- Wait, I'll take his feet.
- OK.

573
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:39,816
Take his feet first.

574
01:05:39,944 --> 01:05:42,276
I'll take the arms.

575
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,646
He's a weight, isn't he?

576
01:05:44,782 --> 01:05:47,865
Wait, I've got to pull him round.

577
01:05:47,994 --> 01:05:51,783
- One, two, three...
- Let's get him away from here.

578
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:56,579
- He'll be all right like that.
- Take his foot.

579
01:05:56,711 --> 01:06:00,124
I'll untie this shoe, you do the other.

580
01:06:02,467 --> 01:06:04,083
He's heavy!

581
01:06:08,014 --> 01:06:10,051
Off with his trousers!

582
01:06:10,183 --> 01:06:14,017
- One, two, three.
- You'll have to raise him a bit.

583
01:06:28,576 --> 01:06:30,738
Give me that rag, would you?

584
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:34,366
Are you all right?

585
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,415
You look a bit green about the gills!

586
01:06:38,878 --> 01:06:39,993
The awful stench!

587
01:06:40,713 --> 01:06:44,251
- I'll do his arse.
- This'll do.

588
01:06:44,842 --> 01:06:48,005
I'll just scour his toes,

589
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:51,763
so he looks presentable, the Uncle.

590
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:57,352
Do the head, nothing else.
Just the head.

591
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,141
I can do his neck as well.

592
01:06:59,273 --> 01:07:01,139
No need to see the rest of him.

593
01:07:03,403 --> 01:07:05,861
Now we can put him in his grave.

594
01:07:07,573 --> 01:07:11,191
- All washed and tidy.
- You've forgotten something.

595
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:14,865
Let me do it.

596
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:21,872
Hold him up, you two.

597
01:08:19,687 --> 01:08:21,269
You fancy him, don't you?

598
01:08:59,727 --> 01:09:02,435
- Come and get it!
- Straight from the wine-press.

599
01:09:02,563 --> 01:09:04,770
Good. I'm thirsty.

600
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:07,015
Come down here, all of you.
Refreshments!

601
01:09:07,818 --> 01:09:09,980
- What is it?
- Grape juice.

602
01:09:20,248 --> 01:09:22,239
- Tastes good!
- Be careful, though.

603
01:09:23,501 --> 01:09:24,491
Why?

604
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,961
Most people drink too much of it
and have to crap all day.

605
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:29,830
It can go straight through you.

606
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,562
Wait a minute...

607
01:09:50,861 --> 01:09:53,478
You can drink as much as you like.

608
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:57,319
Grape juice, fresh from the press.

609
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,742
Drink!

610
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:04,661
But not so much that
it comes out the back of you.

611
01:10:04,792 --> 01:10:07,284
Out of the back of you?

612
01:10:08,546 --> 01:10:10,253
I'm so thirsty.

613
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,836
It's good!

614
01:10:19,098 --> 01:10:20,930
Henriette, be careful!

615
01:10:35,281 --> 01:10:40,276
Walter's father died just where
you're standing, last July third.

616
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:44,822
We only found him next morning.
He was behind the altar,

617
01:10:44,957 --> 01:10:46,664
so we couldn't see him.

618
01:10:50,504 --> 01:10:54,247
I never knew Walter's mother.

619
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:56,249
She died last winter.

620
01:10:58,804 --> 01:11:02,672
Walter says,
his father died of grief.

621
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:09,224
So would I,
if anything happened to Walter.

622
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,651
We're made for each other, Jakob.

623
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:21,816
If only father would see that
two people can belong together

624
01:11:21,952 --> 01:11:24,193
even if they have different religions.

625
01:11:25,706 --> 01:11:28,698
A Catholic can be
just as god-fearing as a Protestant.

626
01:11:32,213 --> 01:11:34,830
Walter is a fine man,
and wise with it.

627
01:11:41,889 --> 01:11:44,051
That's such a boon
in these terrible times.

628
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:49,428
Lena...

629
01:11:53,567 --> 01:11:55,808
I'm all set to emigrate.

630
01:11:57,822 --> 01:12:00,564
- What's put that in your head?
- I want to be...

631
01:12:02,076 --> 01:12:04,568
...where the sun goes
when it sets here.

632
01:12:06,414 --> 01:12:07,996
Do you see?

633
01:12:15,589 --> 01:12:17,626
When it gets dark here...

634
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,087
...it gets light over there.

635
01:12:21,721 --> 01:12:24,884
Much lighter
than it can ever be here.

636
01:13:00,384 --> 01:13:03,467
Will you read to me?
ls it about the tropics?

637
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,795
No.

638
01:13:05,931 --> 01:13:08,889
I only got it from
the lending library yesterday.

639
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:12,602
It's by Paulino Reitz
on the Rio Grande.

640
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,854
He's a Catholic missionary.

641
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,433
He explains in Portuguese

642
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:22,403
how the different rainforest tribes
talk to one another.

643
01:13:22,907 --> 01:13:25,239
And what do they say?

644
01:13:28,746 --> 01:13:32,831
The Cayucachfla Indians, for example,
have 22 words for "green",

645
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:35,871
but no words for "left" and "right".

646
01:13:36,003 --> 01:13:39,496
But the Xancaral
do have direction words,

647
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:46,379
like "downstream" or "nose direction"
or "treetop direction".

648
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:52,593
The Cayucachfla always know where to
find things and what they're looking for.

649
01:13:55,356 --> 01:13:57,688
And how do they say "arm"?

650
01:14:01,278 --> 01:14:02,768
Arm?

651
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,776
Ko-yu.

652
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,034
But a raised arm is galk-yu.

653
01:14:10,162 --> 01:14:11,903
- Ko-yu.
- Ko-yu.

654
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,364
- Galk-yu.
- Galk-yu.

655
01:14:15,209 --> 01:14:19,077
- Stretch it sideways and it's ptak-yu.
- Ptak-yu.

656
01:14:19,213 --> 01:14:22,706
Because in the jungle
every motion counts.

657
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:28,920
And like this?

658
01:14:32,309 --> 01:14:34,721
The natives don't do that.

659
01:14:34,854 --> 01:14:38,848
They... cross their arms
on their chest,

660
01:14:38,983 --> 01:14:43,193
bend forward a bit and say:
Na ana mana sezu.

661
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,862
Na ana mana sezu.

662
01:14:53,205 --> 01:14:54,912
Right.

663
01:15:03,841 --> 01:15:07,175
I... I thought I'd got over it,

664
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:12,054
but now it's starting all over again.

665
01:15:12,182 --> 01:15:15,095
It's because you drank too much.

666
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:24,396
Tay yuk am si-u uklu tand-la-o.

667
01:15:24,528 --> 01:15:26,565
What's that mean?

668
01:15:27,865 --> 01:15:31,950
- "Can you keep a secret"?
- In Caca-Coochie?

669
01:15:32,077 --> 01:15:33,567
Cayucachua.

670
01:15:34,747 --> 01:15:36,329
Well, can you?

671
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:38,864
You've got a secret?

672
01:15:40,628 --> 01:15:43,837
Our secret. Remember?

673
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:51,548
- I'm leaving the country.
- For Brazil?

674
01:15:53,724 --> 01:15:57,683
I'm putting in a request
for an emigration permit.

675
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:01,516
Is that why you're learning
those jungle languages?

676
01:16:02,316 --> 01:16:06,731
Yes. Because if you suddenly
come across natives in the jungle,

677
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,229
you can tell what they're planning.
Do you see?

678
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:12,824
You can say:
na ana mana sezu,

679
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,448
and they'll know
you have good intentions.

680
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:21,199
Or if they come up to you and say:
talu tatem-tel,

681
01:16:21,335 --> 01:16:25,203
it means they're on the warpath and
you have to say that you come in peace.

682
01:16:25,339 --> 01:16:28,502
- Chentu hime ya-ye.
- Chentu hime ya-ye.

683
01:16:28,634 --> 01:16:33,174
Yes. Or... you offer them a gift.

684
01:16:33,305 --> 01:16:36,423
- An ulma pta-keel.
- What on earth is that?

685
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:39,892
"Ulma" means gift
and "pta-keel" means fire.

686
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:43,809
It just means a box of matches.
They've never seen them before.

687
01:16:43,941 --> 01:16:46,524
And then you're their friend
straightaway.

688
01:16:59,373 --> 01:17:01,705
Will you take me to see the natives,
Jakob?

689
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:03,290
Look, I'm serious.

690
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,570
Look who's here. Gustav.

691
01:17:41,582 --> 01:17:42,788
How did you find me?

692
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,831
Grandmother knows all.

693
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:48,411
Jakob, come back home.
We need you.

694
01:17:50,007 --> 01:17:53,921
And what about our sister? Isn't it time
she came back to Schabbach too?

695
01:17:54,762 --> 01:17:56,344
It's about time.

696
01:17:56,472 --> 01:17:58,133
Jakob...

697
01:18:00,517 --> 01:18:01,507
Uncle is dead.

698
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:05,394
But there was nothing wrong with him.

699
01:18:05,522 --> 01:18:07,183
The funeral is on Friday.

700
01:18:28,462 --> 01:18:30,920
He was always on my side.

701
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,416
Friday?

702
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:39,713
No one in the village understood him.
No one.

703
01:19:10,671 --> 01:19:12,628
The three of us.

704
01:19:13,507 --> 01:19:16,590
Yes... the three of us.

705
01:19:18,178 --> 01:19:19,714
It's true.

706
01:19:22,933 --> 01:19:25,641
- Only mother's not here.
- And father.

707
01:19:29,148 --> 01:19:30,730
I miss them all.

708
01:19:35,195 --> 01:19:38,608
Leave-taking comes naturally
to all human creatures.

709
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:43,113
The days of our lives pass one by one
and we shall never see any of them again.

710
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:47,455
Just as the dead take a part of us
with them into their silent graves,

711
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:50,575
so time and youth pass away from us,
never to return.

712
01:19:52,379 --> 01:19:56,543
Remembrance of lost love
is reunion and farewell in one.

713
01:19:56,675 --> 01:19:59,838
All poets tell us this,

714
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:02,302
and I felt the truth of it
at the Smearcase Fair

715
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:05,640
on the seventh day
of November, 1842,

716
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:09,931
when the sun set on my endeavours,

717
01:20:10,063 --> 01:20:12,020
not to shine again for many a long day.

718
01:20:47,434 --> 01:20:48,924
Strange as it may seem to say so,

719
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:52,554
the Smear case Fair was
the disaster of my life.

720
01:20:53,565 --> 01:20:57,058
They call it "Cold Feet Fair"

721
01:20:57,194 --> 01:21:00,403
because it comes
in the early days of November

722
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:03,693
when the work in the fields is done
and the quiet rooms

723
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:06,988
wait for the loved ones to come home
and sit in tranquil reunion.

724
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:12,991
All the lads and lasses from the villages
of Simmern and Herrstein county came,

725
01:21:13,126 --> 01:21:16,994
as I did though I had no skill
or knowledge of the dance.

726
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,871
My brother bade me accompany him,
so I went.

727
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:23,046
Smearcase!
Smearcase from Schabbach!

728
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:25,715
Buy Schabbach Smearcase!

729
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:28,805
It's the best smearcase
in all the world,

730
01:21:28,934 --> 01:21:31,972
what am I saying:
in all of the Hunsrück!

731
01:21:33,814 --> 01:21:36,351
Three farthings for
a slice of bread with smearcase.

732
01:21:36,483 --> 01:21:39,851
In the pot there are agate marbles.

733
01:21:39,987 --> 01:21:41,352
If you find one,

734
01:21:41,488 --> 01:21:44,105
you can keep it, and you can get
another slice of smearcase.

735
01:21:44,241 --> 01:21:47,859
- The other's for my friend.
- There are two pieces of silver.

736
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:52,159
If you find one, you can keep it,
and you'll get another slice of smearcase.

737
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:54,783
- What about us?
- Smearcase from Schabbach!

738
01:21:56,253 --> 01:22:02,249
- Henriette! I've got a marble!
- What have you got?

739
01:22:05,345 --> 01:22:07,632
Oh, that's pretty.

740
01:22:07,764 --> 01:22:09,380
You got a slice of bread for me?

741
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,968
We must claim our reward.
Come!

742
01:22:14,104 --> 01:22:16,061
Smearcase from Schabbach!

743
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:18,681
No money back if you don't like it.

744
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:23,060
We never had any truck with that.

745
01:22:25,032 --> 01:22:27,945
Who's got a marble?
Who's got a marble?

746
01:22:29,703 --> 01:22:33,287
Of course they're in there,
Florine found one.

747
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:36,203
She's got her hands full.

748
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:40,419
Enjoy it while it's hot.

749
01:23:42,692 --> 01:23:44,933
Look at your brother!
He's no slouch!

750
01:24:00,293 --> 01:24:02,955
- Jakob, are you not dancing?
- No.

751
01:24:03,422 --> 01:24:04,583
I'll show you how.

752
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,340
...two, jump-

753
01:24:16,476 --> 01:24:18,058
One, two, jump.

754
01:24:42,002 --> 01:24:43,367
Gustav was in the army.

755
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:48,004
- Na ana mana sezu.
- Na ana mana sezu.

756
01:24:48,884 --> 01:24:51,296
Does that mean,
fancy something to drink?

757
01:24:52,429 --> 01:24:54,591
- Yes.
- Then come.

758
01:24:59,019 --> 01:25:01,010
- Butterling!
- Gustav!

759
01:25:04,107 --> 01:25:06,189
- Give me four glasses of wine.
- I can't.

760
01:25:06,318 --> 01:25:10,482
My cellars are full of wine,
but I'm not allowed to sell it.

761
01:25:11,364 --> 01:25:14,482
You're having men on. What kind of fair
would it be without wine?

762
01:25:14,618 --> 01:25:19,704
The baron in Gemünden has the
exclusive right to sell wine till Christmas.

763
01:25:19,831 --> 01:25:21,321
But that's impossible.

764
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:24,621
It's possible here, all right.
Ancient privileges, they call it.

765
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:28,587
- Skulduggery, if you ask me.
- So what now?

766
01:25:28,715 --> 01:25:31,924
- I can give you schnapps.
- Then give me schnapps. Four glasses.

767
01:25:48,818 --> 01:25:53,733
I'd love to hear all those 22 words
the natives have for "green".

768
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:55,947
You know them all?

769
01:25:56,576 --> 01:26:00,069
Let's see.
See those pine branches down there?

770
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:03,573
That is "lika-la-itu".

771
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:09,582
And...

772
01:26:09,714 --> 01:26:12,081
what about that woman's frock?

773
01:26:13,843 --> 01:26:14,833
Fim-sa-la.

774
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,588
- Fim-sa-la?
- Fim-ssa-la, with a proper

775
01:26:18,723 --> 01:26:20,634
All right, fim-ssa-la.

776
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:29,310
And that little copper lamp up here?

777
01:26:29,442 --> 01:26:32,275
I'm not sure
if the Cayucachfla have copper.

778
01:26:32,404 --> 01:26:35,567
Yuki-hem? Ka-yi?

779
01:26:36,366 --> 01:26:38,277
No. Holm-huo.

780
01:26:38,868 --> 01:26:41,610
- Holm-huo?
- Yes, that's holm-huo.

781
01:26:44,082 --> 01:26:48,167
In another context
holm-hu-ho also means "heart's ease".

782
01:26:48,295 --> 01:26:51,833
But if you say it about a lamp,
then it means "green".

783
01:26:55,594 --> 01:27:00,589
I always knew Henriette and Jakob
would end up together. I just knew it.

784
01:27:00,724 --> 01:27:02,089
Honestly.

785
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:09,935
No one, not a single person anywhere
in the Hunsrück is like you, Jakob.

786
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:16,687
Have you ever heard
Florine and her brothers sing?

787
01:27:16,823 --> 01:27:18,063
- No.
- No?

788
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:20,861
Then you ought to. Come on!

789
01:27:20,994 --> 01:27:24,157
- Wait a minute. I've got to sing.
- Well, sing then!

790
01:27:54,361 --> 01:27:57,820
<i>When they go marching through
the streets, the soldier's boys so brave</i>

791
01:27:57,947 --> 01:28:01,156
<i>All the pretty girls in town
stand at the door and wave</i>

792
01:28:01,284 --> 01:28:04,822
<i>- But why?
- Because!</i>

793
01:28:04,954 --> 01:28:08,572
<i>Because they go toot-toot,
Boom-boom, chingsa-rassada...</i>

794
01:28:18,843 --> 01:28:20,425
Well? Why aren't you dancing?

795
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:25,130
- I think Jakob's scared to.
- Scared, is he? But you aren't!

796
01:28:26,685 --> 01:28:29,518
You're a proper little spinning top!

797
01:28:30,146 --> 01:28:31,136
Here, hold this!

798
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:54,038
<i>When the bombs and hand grenades
go woosh and bang out in the glades</i>

799
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:58,038
<i>The girls all weep and make a noise
for the poor soldier boys</i>

800
01:29:00,593 --> 01:29:02,550
But why?

801
01:29:41,217 --> 01:29:44,505
<i>When they come back from the trenches</i>

802
01:29:44,637 --> 01:29:47,846
<i>All the girls are someone else 's</i>

803
01:29:47,974 --> 01:29:51,467
<i>- But why?
- Because!</i>

804
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:56,498
What's going on here?
Get out of the way!

805
01:30:57,502 --> 01:30:59,539
Get out of the way!

806
01:31:01,548 --> 01:31:04,631
They're unloading those barrels.
Get that out of here!

807
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:06,670
Give us a hand!

808
01:31:09,347 --> 01:31:11,291
When will you finally learn?

809
01:31:11,317 --> 01:31:15,204
These are established privileges,
set down in writing.

810
01:31:18,273 --> 01:31:21,766
They say we can only drink
the baron's wine at the fair.

811
01:31:26,114 --> 01:31:27,821
That's how it's always been,

812
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:31,032
- even before the French came.
- Put a rag in it!

813
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:34,994
The Smearcase Fair
has always been in November.

814
01:31:36,165 --> 01:31:39,874
We see no reason why those blackguards
should line their pockets at our expense.

815
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:44,621
Did you call me a blackguard?

816
01:31:44,757 --> 01:31:46,043
Do you know who I am?

817
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:50,635
You're in their pay, that's all.

818
01:31:51,848 --> 01:31:53,759
Robbers they are!

819
01:31:53,892 --> 01:31:56,475
First the French,
now the accursed gentry!

820
01:31:57,145 --> 01:32:01,639
They won't leave us anything,
not even the ground to sit our arses on!

821
01:32:01,774 --> 01:32:04,562
That's right!
This is our fair!

822
01:32:06,112 --> 01:32:10,106
And this is my shop,
and I want to sell our wine.

823
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:12,653
So that at least
a few farthings stay in the village.

824
01:32:12,785 --> 01:32:15,698
If we don't stand up for ourselves,
we've had it!

825
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,322
The baron's got enough.

826
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:22,543
- He won't starve. Am I right?
- Yes!

827
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,035
He's right!

828
01:32:24,172 --> 01:32:26,163
From now on
we only sell our own wine.

829
01:32:26,883 --> 01:32:30,717
And we're not coughing up
to feed those layabouts.

830
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:33,803
Like that fat slob over there!

831
01:32:36,309 --> 01:32:40,519
They don't give a damn
whether we live or die.

832
01:32:40,647 --> 01:32:46,939
No more free wine and sweetmeats for
the beadle and the forestry commissioner!

833
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:51,029
Egalité!
It's time the word became law!

834
01:32:53,993 --> 01:32:57,531
How about a little dance, Mr overseer?
Come down!

835
01:32:57,664 --> 01:32:58,904
Sedition!

836
01:32:59,958 --> 01:33:01,039
This is sedition!

837
01:33:12,428 --> 01:33:15,261
What's wrong with you people?
ls this your idea of diversion?

838
01:33:16,099 --> 01:33:17,089
Disband!

839
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:20,095
- The times are changing.
- You!

840
01:33:20,228 --> 01:33:21,764
Unload those barrels!

841
01:33:21,896 --> 01:33:24,934
We'll shit in their golden dishes!

842
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,567
Have you seen your brother?

843
01:33:36,703 --> 01:33:38,159
Is he not on the dance-floor?

844
01:33:38,287 --> 01:33:41,996
This is sedition! Revolution!
Resistance to the authorities!

845
01:33:42,125 --> 01:33:44,492
And you've not seen Henriette either?

846
01:33:44,627 --> 01:33:46,163
Best regards to the baron!

847
01:33:46,295 --> 01:33:49,504
From now on
he can guzzle his own wine!

848
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:54,008
Down from there!

849
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,431
Don't you dare!

850
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:54,353
- Revenge is underway!
- Up yours, overseer!

851
01:34:59,952 --> 01:35:03,240
It's time to celebrate!

852
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:07,244
Drink, drink!

853
01:35:08,127 --> 01:35:10,710
They'll make you pay in the end.

854
01:35:14,383 --> 01:35:17,626
Drink and enjoy!

855
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:21,304
We've got enough to go round.

856
01:35:21,432 --> 01:35:22,763
Drink!

857
01:36:14,026 --> 01:36:16,358
It's like the earth has swallowed them up.

858
01:36:16,487 --> 01:36:19,275
- Who do you mean?
- Your brother and Henriette.

859
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,868
Did you see the bashing
your brothers gave them?

860
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,036
Who?

861
01:36:27,165 --> 01:36:28,872
The baron's men.

862
01:36:39,385 --> 01:36:40,967
I'm going home.

863
01:37:47,245 --> 01:37:49,077
Hold it up!

864
01:38:31,455 --> 01:38:34,948
Come on, have some more.
It's free today.

865
01:38:37,586 --> 01:38:39,497
Here. Another swig for you.

866
01:38:54,645 --> 01:38:58,434
The fair is over.
It must close down forthwith.

867
01:38:59,275 --> 01:39:05,021
The fair is closed due to public insolence,
sedition and insubordination.

868
01:39:06,866 --> 01:39:12,157
Stop the music, stop dancing!
Stop the music!

869
01:39:12,288 --> 01:39:17,624
The ringleaders are to be arrested
and taken into custody.

870
01:39:17,752 --> 01:39:20,119
Those who resist,

871
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:22,621
will be clapped in jail.

872
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:26,879
- Who started the rioting?
- What rioting?

873
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:33,093
It was the baron.

874
01:39:35,561 --> 01:39:37,427
You've got a big mouth,

875
01:39:38,522 --> 01:39:39,933
but we'll soon close it for you.

876
01:39:40,524 --> 01:39:43,892
- What's your name, fellow?
- Call me... Liberté!

877
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:47,603
Call me Liberté!

878
01:40:01,587 --> 01:40:02,952
Liberté!

879
01:40:04,757 --> 01:40:06,247
Liberté!

880
01:40:13,057 --> 01:40:14,047
Liberté!

881
01:40:21,273 --> 01:40:22,604
Liberté!

882
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:25,767
Liberté!

883
01:40:26,695 --> 01:40:28,231
Liberté!

884
01:40:30,199 --> 01:40:31,735
Liberté!

885
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:34,492
Liberté!

886
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:37,745
Liberté!

887
01:40:39,542 --> 01:40:40,657
Liberté!

888
01:40:43,462 --> 01:40:44,748
Liberté!

889
01:40:45,256 --> 01:40:48,214
Liberté!

890
01:40:48,342 --> 01:40:50,083
- Go home, lad.
- Liberté!

891
01:40:50,219 --> 01:40:52,460
- Sleep it off!
- Liberté!

892
01:40:52,972 --> 01:40:56,840
- Long live Young Germany!
- If that's how you want it.

893
01:40:56,976 --> 01:40:58,592
Liberté!

894
01:40:59,562 --> 01:41:01,428
Liberté!

895
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:08,507
In the name of His Majesty,
the King of Prussia,

896
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:10,926
and the royal household
administrations,

897
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:13,675
pay heed to the following decree!

898
01:42:14,845 --> 01:42:18,595
The gathering of foliage, litter,
moss, heath, turf and grass

899
01:42:18,649 --> 01:42:22,984
in the royal woodlands is forbidden,
as is the breaking of stone.

900
01:42:23,738 --> 01:42:26,400
It is prohibited, on pain of retribution,
to dig up mud, clay, sand or marl

901
01:42:26,532 --> 01:42:30,241
for the construction or reinforcement
of buildings, paths and cattle tracks,

902
01:42:30,369 --> 01:42:36,536
fields, meadows and gardens
or whatever else.

903
01:42:37,835 --> 01:42:42,580
In the royal hunting grounds
it is prohibited to bring down game,

904
01:42:42,715 --> 01:42:47,585
birds or any other creatures,
to plunder nests for eggs,

905
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:50,087
and to make use
of the royal waters for fishing,

906
01:42:50,222 --> 01:42:56,594
retting flax, irrigation of land
or any other purpose whatsoever.

907
01:42:57,646 --> 01:43:01,059
No one is permitted to avail themselves
of dry, green, cut or uncut wood

908
01:43:01,192 --> 01:43:06,232
standing or lying in forests,
enclosures or flowing water,

909
01:43:06,363 --> 01:43:09,071
nor to possess themselves
of kindling, acorns, beech mast

910
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,568
or other fruits of the woods,
tree-bark for tanning,

911
01:43:12,703 --> 01:43:17,288
wild fruit, berries,
mushrooms, and so forth.

912
01:43:17,416 --> 01:43:19,783
The keepers and wardens
have been instructed

913
01:43:19,919 --> 01:43:24,163
to report any violations of this decree
to their superiors forthwith

914
01:43:24,298 --> 01:43:27,586
and to ensure that any offence
against the laws of the forest

915
01:43:27,718 --> 01:43:31,211
be punished severely, in accordance
with the edicts of the state...

916
01:43:44,944 --> 01:43:47,402
What higher aspiration can there be

917
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,362
than to join forces and seek a path

918
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:51,652
on which to escape from tyranny
and heartlessness?

919
01:43:52,993 --> 01:43:55,655
Olm is a true friend.

920
01:43:55,788 --> 01:43:58,576
I have learned so much from him.

921
01:43:58,707 --> 01:44:03,417
Now I understand where wrongdoing
and hardship have their origins,

922
01:44:03,546 --> 01:44:07,210
not in God, but in our own hearts.

923
01:44:14,598 --> 01:44:18,466
Freedom
is not the opposite of captivity.

924
01:44:18,602 --> 01:44:23,392
It is a holy right vouchsafed to us all.

925
01:44:25,526 --> 01:44:27,016
What do you see?

926
01:44:28,988 --> 01:44:30,399
Snow.

927
01:44:32,783 --> 01:44:34,148
Snow.

928
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:19,949
- They told me Florine's ill.
- She's up there in bed, snorting.

929
01:45:20,664 --> 01:45:23,907
- What's wrong with her?
- We don't know. The snots.

930
01:45:55,532 --> 01:45:56,863
Look.

931
01:45:58,827 --> 01:46:00,943
I've brought you some apples.

932
01:46:03,123 --> 01:46:05,865
And a jar of smearcase
from the fair.

933
01:46:08,671 --> 01:46:11,914
And two bars of
our good lavender soap.

934
01:46:12,049 --> 01:46:14,381
To make you smell nice.

935
01:46:37,616 --> 01:46:39,277
Are you still angry with me?

936
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,412
I've brought you something else.

937
01:47:04,018 --> 01:47:05,508
Look!

938
01:47:19,074 --> 01:47:22,408
- Don't give me anything.
- It's Christmas time.

939
01:47:23,996 --> 01:47:27,705
You can give it back
when you get well again.

940
01:47:38,135 --> 01:47:40,001
You're with child, aren't you?

941
01:47:52,066 --> 01:47:53,101
Does it show?

942
01:47:57,196 --> 01:47:59,312
<i>Gustav“ have to marry you.</i>

943
01:48:01,992 --> 01:48:04,233
But I hardly know him.

944
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:09,038
I mean, not like you.

945
01:48:30,813 --> 01:48:35,182
Do you want to know how Jakob is?

946
01:48:35,317 --> 01:48:38,400
They'll put a stop
to his mad ideas there.

947
01:48:38,529 --> 01:48:42,193
It'll make a man out of him.
Am I right?

948
01:48:56,713 --> 01:48:58,954
If only I knew...

949
01:49:01,009 --> 01:49:02,841
Knew what?

950
01:49:05,264 --> 01:49:07,426
How I can help him.

951
01:49:09,476 --> 01:49:11,717
We must get him out 0f that dungeon.

952
01:49:34,418 --> 01:49:37,376
Can I leave this basket with you
while I visit my son?

953
01:49:45,637 --> 01:49:48,254
You don't mind
if I put the basket down here?

954
01:49:54,229 --> 01:49:56,186
I won't be long.

955
01:49:59,484 --> 01:50:01,896
Right,
I'll be putting it down here, then.

956
01:50:27,471 --> 01:50:29,132
Jakob...

957
01:50:29,264 --> 01:50:31,756
Those warders are all crooks,
I can tell.

958
01:50:31,892 --> 01:50:34,384
They'd do anything for money.

959
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:40,307
Where am I supposed to
get money from?

960
01:50:42,861 --> 01:50:44,443
Look!

961
01:50:51,662 --> 01:50:54,654
This is enough
to get you out of here twice over!

962
01:50:54,790 --> 01:50:58,374
Mother, where did you
get so much money?

963
01:50:59,795 --> 01:51:03,333
I'll tell you when we've got you home.

964
01:51:19,106 --> 01:51:20,688
Gee up!

965
01:52:02,232 --> 01:52:03,973
It's a sign, all right.

966
01:52:05,527 --> 01:52:08,235
But still no sign of Jakob.

967
01:52:20,542 --> 01:52:24,752
How often has that louis d'or
scorched my skin like hell fire!

968
01:52:25,714 --> 01:52:27,955
A thousand times
I have asked myself

969
01:52:28,091 --> 01:52:32,836
whether the value of freedom
can be expressed in gold coin.

970
01:52:34,556 --> 01:52:37,674
Such questions
torment my tremulous heart.

971
01:52:39,811 --> 01:52:44,681
Even my friend Olm, so contemptuous
of the clergy and the Prussian king,

972
01:52:44,816 --> 01:52:47,524
beseeches me to hold out with him
and not to pay money

973
01:52:47,652 --> 01:52:51,065
for something that is priceless.

974
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:56,363
He says a sign from Heaven will come
and warn us that liberty is nigh,

975
01:52:56,495 --> 01:53:00,454
that mother to us all, seated on
a throne more precious than gold.

976
01:53:04,044 --> 01:53:06,001
Is it the end of the world, pastor?

977
01:53:09,883 --> 01:53:13,126
On the second day of March 1843,

978
01:53:13,261 --> 01:53:18,973
the comet will attain such brightness
as to be visible by day.

979
01:53:19,101 --> 01:53:20,808
It belongs to the Kreutz group

980
01:53:20,936 --> 01:53:25,772
and its tail has the extraordinary length
of two astronomical units.

981
01:53:33,657 --> 01:53:34,647
It's a sign.

982
01:53:37,702 --> 01:53:40,160
A sign of nothing, Frau Niem.

983
01:53:44,126 --> 01:53:46,242
I've come about my Henriette.

984
01:53:49,297 --> 01:53:51,038
Why? What ails her?

985
01:53:58,306 --> 01:54:00,217
You're a decent lad.

986
01:54:02,561 --> 01:54:04,802
Henriette thinks so,

987
01:54:04,938 --> 01:54:08,806
so do my husband and me,
all three of us think so.

988
01:54:11,111 --> 01:54:14,524
Or should I say all four?

989
01:54:45,937 --> 01:54:47,803
No one can hear us in here.

990
01:54:56,656 --> 01:54:58,488
Now we can talk.

991
01:55:05,081 --> 01:55:11,077
I'm here to tell you that Henriette,
my husband and me,

992
01:55:11,838 --> 01:55:13,954
we're all in favour of you.

993
01:55:16,551 --> 01:55:21,091
So we thought you might first
have a word with your parents,

994
01:55:22,474 --> 01:55:25,842
then could come out to Kirchwiller

995
01:55:26,937 --> 01:55:29,850
and ask for Henriette's hand.

996
01:55:32,692 --> 01:55:34,854
But you mustn't wait too long,

997
01:55:36,488 --> 01:55:39,731
otherwise it'll show at the wedding.

998
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:44,026
You understand, don't you?

999
01:55:46,456 --> 01:55:50,370
She deserves
to be married in a nice dress,

1000
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:54,662
such a nice-looking girl as she is.

1001
01:56:01,888 --> 01:56:04,550
You understand
what I'm saying, don't you?

1002
01:56:08,353 --> 01:56:09,718
I do, but...

1003
01:56:13,733 --> 01:56:16,475
I've got this steam engine to build.

1004
01:56:27,038 --> 01:56:28,494
Father?

1005
01:56:29,332 --> 01:56:31,073
Where are you going?

1006
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:37,747
One, two, three, up!

1007
01:56:37,882 --> 01:56:39,589
- Has it gone in?
- It has.

1008
01:56:40,176 --> 01:56:41,712
It's fine.

1009
01:56:41,845 --> 01:56:45,213
I'll just get the crank
to put in the mechanism.

1010
01:56:54,733 --> 01:56:56,315
The blocks.

1011
01:56:57,277 --> 01:56:59,234
- Is it all right?
- Yes.

1012
01:57:01,406 --> 01:57:02,737
The cuffs.

1013
01:57:11,458 --> 01:57:12,789
The screws.

1014
01:57:21,509 --> 01:57:23,341
They fit?

1015
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:25,460
They fit.

1016
01:58:39,921 --> 01:58:42,709
Go and get Henriette from the carriage.

1017
01:59:06,406 --> 01:59:08,738
Look after father for me.

1018
01:59:10,785 --> 01:59:12,776
Put her down here.

1019
01:59:12,912 --> 01:59:14,573
- That's right.
- Here?

1020
01:59:14,706 --> 01:59:16,413
Here.

1021
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:18,327
Gustav!

1022
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:21,122
The pastor!
Put her down here.

1023
01:59:22,422 --> 01:59:24,038
Come along!

1024
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:31,052
Here! The foghorn.

1025
01:59:31,181 --> 01:59:32,842
- Good morning.
- One moment, pastor.

1026
01:59:33,349 --> 01:59:37,058
- You're the bridesmaid, you have to...
- Oh, do stop fussing!

1027
01:59:38,062 --> 01:59:42,101
Go on ahead.
And take the flowers with you!

1028
02:00:00,585 --> 02:00:02,121
Father!

1029
02:01:04,983 --> 02:01:06,348
Mother?

1030
02:01:25,962 --> 02:01:27,452
Wait a moment.

1031
02:01:29,299 --> 02:01:30,789
Mother?

1032
02:02:11,007 --> 02:02:13,374
Everything in its time.

1033
02:02:14,761 --> 02:02:16,923
And you're too late.

1034
02:02:22,977 --> 02:02:25,218
Is my husband in here?

1035
02:02:27,523 --> 02:02:30,015
He wasn't in church,

1036
02:02:30,151 --> 02:02:33,143
I thought he was
with the Morsch brothers.

1037
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:35,486
Now he's vanished again.

1038
02:02:36,199 --> 02:02:39,908
He can't just ignore his daughter
on the biggest day of her life.

1039
02:02:42,705 --> 02:02:44,366
Fürchtegott!

1040
02:02:48,252 --> 02:02:50,163
Fürchtegott!

1041
02:03:03,977 --> 02:03:05,012
Gustav!

1042
02:03:05,144 --> 02:03:07,556
Gustav, you have to escort her in.

1043
02:03:16,739 --> 02:03:18,321
Wait, Henriette!

1044
02:03:18,449 --> 02:03:21,111
- Gustav, carry her over the threshold!
- Right.

1045
02:03:22,912 --> 02:03:24,698
Here goes!

1046
02:03:26,332 --> 02:03:27,948
That's right!

1047
02:03:40,179 --> 02:03:42,671
High time, Pastor Wiegand!

1048
02:03:47,353 --> 02:03:49,515
An uplifting ceremony, am I right?

1049
02:03:55,236 --> 02:03:57,193
I'm famished.

1050
02:03:57,321 --> 02:04:02,031
- Take no notice of me.
- Now you two cut the cake. Together.

1051
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:03,400
Me?

1052
02:04:11,627 --> 02:04:15,962
Now we're all related, I can say it.

1053
02:04:17,341 --> 02:04:20,675
When we were rolling in money,

1054
02:04:20,803 --> 02:04:23,295
and Henriette was about 10 years old,

1055
02:04:25,016 --> 02:04:28,805
my idea of a wedding was
something very different from this.

1056
02:04:30,188 --> 02:04:31,553
Then,

1057
02:04:32,732 --> 02:04:34,643
all of a sudden,

1058
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:38,193
it petered out.

1059
02:04:40,531 --> 02:04:43,068
No more agate anywhere.

1060
02:04:44,994 --> 02:04:46,951
It wasn't our fault.

1061
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:55,543
Did you know that,
over here in Schabbach?

1062
02:05:04,764 --> 02:05:07,597
Listen, all of you! Jakob's back.

1063
02:05:07,725 --> 02:05:10,968
Your Jakob!
I saw him with my own eyes.

1064
02:05:11,104 --> 02:05:13,812
It was him all right.

1065
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:16,147
Jakob's back.

1066
02:05:16,275 --> 02:05:17,640
Jakob?

1067
02:05:17,777 --> 02:05:19,984
Yes. Come out here, all of you.

1068
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:25,861
Where did you see him?

1069
02:05:25,993 --> 02:05:27,654
Jakob!

1070
02:05:27,787 --> 02:05:30,370
- No point looking in the smithy!
- I saw him here.

1071
02:05:30,498 --> 02:05:33,081
- He was sitting just there.
- Didn't he say anything?

1072
02:05:33,209 --> 02:05:34,950
Where's he gone?

1073
02:05:35,086 --> 02:05:37,874
Down that way.

1074
02:05:38,005 --> 02:05:40,372
You've been hitting the bottle again!

1075
02:05:40,508 --> 02:05:42,499
I saw him, I tell you!

1076
02:06:45,615 --> 02:06:47,231
Anyone home?

1077
02:06:49,994 --> 02:06:51,530
<i>Luise?</i>

1078
02:06:52,914 --> 02:06:56,657
I don't want to intrude.
I can sleep somewhere else.

1079
02:07:03,716 --> 02:07:05,127
Luise.

1080
02:07:25,571 --> 02:07:28,313
Remember? Your hat?

1081
02:07:41,003 --> 02:07:43,836
My friend
shared all his thoughts with me,

1082
02:07:43,965 --> 02:07:48,050
but never a word passed his lips
about the dire straits he was in.

1083
02:07:48,177 --> 02:07:50,669
The pride of an honorable craftsman
sealed his lips,

1084
02:07:50,805 --> 02:07:53,046
and hardly anyone
so richly deserves that description.

1085
02:07:53,182 --> 02:07:56,425
Hardship was a disgrace, a secret
to be kept from the world at all costs.

1086
02:07:58,187 --> 02:08:04,274
Olm and his family endured their
blameless lot, suffering in silent shame.

1087
02:08:04,402 --> 02:08:07,019
Without sustenance
there can be no dignity.

1088
02:08:08,030 --> 02:08:09,896
Would that some great storm

1089
02:08:10,032 --> 02:08:12,865
finally came to blow away
injustice and despotism for all time!

1090
02:08:17,039 --> 02:08:18,996
For my lodging.

1091
02:08:50,197 --> 02:08:51,858
Here we are.

1092
02:08:58,414 --> 02:09:00,576
Thanks for everything.

1093
02:09:05,755 --> 02:09:07,871
Much obliged!

1094
02:09:10,843 --> 02:09:12,129
Fürchtegott!

1095
02:09:14,221 --> 02:09:16,337
Are you still at work?

1096
02:10:48,774 --> 02:10:51,357
Your home will be with me now.

1097
02:10:51,485 --> 02:10:53,271
We will get to know each other
much better.

1098
02:10:53,404 --> 02:10:55,361
We had no time before.

1099
02:10:55,489 --> 02:10:58,902
And the baby!
I have to make things up to you.

1100
02:11:41,327 --> 02:11:44,536
Any fate is better than death.

1101
02:11:56,717 --> 02:12:00,176
What do you say in Herrstein dialect?
"I sayed"?

1102
02:12:00,304 --> 02:12:03,968
No, here we say "I sedd".

1103
02:12:05,684 --> 02:12:08,221
It's like the Cayucachua dialects.

1104
02:12:09,188 --> 02:12:13,182
"The ceremony was successful"
is either "Tua tush tatekel hum dam a"

1105
02:12:13,984 --> 02:12:17,147
or "Tau tush tatekel ham dum a".

1106
02:12:17,279 --> 02:12:19,737
They just exchange
a couple of vowels.

1107
02:12:21,408 --> 02:12:24,070
- People are the same everywhere.
- Oh no.

1108
02:12:24,203 --> 02:12:27,070
If it were that simple,
we wouldn't need to emigrate.

1109
02:12:28,123 --> 02:12:30,080
We could just stay put.

1110
02:12:34,838 --> 02:12:37,956
There must be something
all languages have in common,

1111
02:12:39,301 --> 02:12:42,510
a secret law,
otherwise we could never communicate.

1112
02:12:43,681 --> 02:12:45,672
For example, how could we say...

1113
02:12:51,981 --> 02:12:53,471
Mother!

1114
02:12:57,945 --> 02:13:00,232
You've got here.

1115
02:13:00,364 --> 02:13:02,025
This is the place!

1116
02:13:06,829 --> 02:13:08,445
Take the basket!

1117
02:13:15,462 --> 02:13:18,295
Mother, you've arrived.

1118
02:13:23,804 --> 02:13:27,217
It has pleased God to turn
everything I do into a paradox.

1119
02:13:28,642 --> 02:13:30,474
On my return, the homesickness

1120
02:13:30,603 --> 02:13:34,187
that plagued me in the prison house

1121
02:13:34,315 --> 02:13:39,105
transformed
into pining affection for a girl

1122
02:13:39,236 --> 02:13:43,776
I was not sure I loved
until I had lost her forever.

1123
02:13:45,784 --> 02:13:48,367
I shall not write down her name here,

1124
02:13:48,495 --> 02:13:50,953
and henceforth
I shall shun her presence.

1125
02:13:51,582 --> 02:13:54,620
The happiness she has found
with another breaks my heart.

1126
02:13:56,337 --> 02:13:59,170
So I cannot go back
to my parents' house.

1127
02:13:59,298 --> 02:14:03,041
But my mother's love for me
will never die.

1128
02:14:03,177 --> 02:14:06,670
I owe her not only my life
but new sustenance every day.

1129
02:14:08,015 --> 02:14:09,926
Here are some carrots...

1130
02:14:10,059 --> 02:14:11,299
Bacon!

1131
02:14:55,354 --> 02:14:59,018
29 July 1843.

1132
02:15:01,652 --> 02:15:04,895
Stay in bed with Matilda!

1133
02:15:05,698 --> 02:15:07,280
They're lovely!

1134
02:15:11,537 --> 02:15:16,657
Now we're coming in under the porch
and into the smithy.

1135
02:15:18,627 --> 02:15:20,368
That's the big flue,

1136
02:15:21,630 --> 02:15:25,749
you're never to go near it on your own.

1137
02:15:25,884 --> 02:15:27,921
Do you hear me?

1138
02:15:28,053 --> 02:15:30,636
The man standing at the anvil

1139
02:15:30,764 --> 02:15:34,348
is your grandfather, the blacksmith.

1140
02:15:37,104 --> 02:15:38,845
And here's the steam engine

1141
02:15:38,981 --> 02:15:42,190
built by your father.
It's almost finished.

1142
02:15:43,569 --> 02:15:47,358
We've christened you Matilda,
after your great-grandmother.

1143
02:15:51,910 --> 02:15:56,404
The name is much too big for you,
but there's plenty of time.

1144
02:15:56,540 --> 02:15:59,999
You'll grow into it, never fear!

1145
02:16:00,127 --> 02:16:02,209
You're barmy!

1146
02:16:15,559 --> 02:16:16,640
Mathilda,

1147
02:16:18,187 --> 02:16:21,680
1843.

1148
02:16:27,696 --> 02:16:29,858
I'll just go and see to the fire.

1149
02:16:51,345 --> 02:16:53,052
Turn the wheel a bit!

1150
02:17:50,988 --> 02:17:53,320
Father! Say something!

1151
02:17:55,325 --> 02:17:58,033
It's working! Where are you all?

1152
02:18:00,163 --> 02:18:04,077
Nauert! Father! Mathilda's running!

1153
02:18:06,753 --> 02:18:08,335
She's running!

1154
02:18:08,463 --> 02:18:12,548
It works! I said it would!
It works!

1155
02:18:18,223 --> 02:18:21,932
Faster! My lovely little lass,
you have to go faster!

1156
02:18:41,079 --> 02:18:43,241
- Gustav, where are you?
- I couldn't stop her!

1157
02:18:43,373 --> 02:18:46,161
You nearly ruined the place!

1158
02:18:47,044 --> 02:18:49,786
- Gustav!
- Henriette!

1159
02:18:55,636 --> 02:18:57,752
She went faster and faster!

1160
02:18:57,888 --> 02:19:00,380
Are you injured?
- No, no.

1161
02:19:00,515 --> 02:19:02,301
I couldn't stop her.

1162
02:19:02,434 --> 02:19:05,301
Faster all the time.
I thought she'd fly away.

1163
02:19:08,273 --> 02:19:10,765
I tried to close the vent. I was lucky.

1164
02:19:11,443 --> 02:19:14,151
The old wall held up.

1165
02:19:14,988 --> 02:19:17,070
- Have you come to any harm?
- No.

1166
02:19:22,037 --> 02:19:25,405
Then we leave the coast of
Mauretania to our left

1167
02:19:26,333 --> 02:19:28,995
and sail past the Canaries,

1168
02:19:29,962 --> 02:19:32,169
west-south-west.

1169
02:19:34,341 --> 02:19:37,629
The Horse Latitudes
are a place on the ocean

1170
02:19:37,761 --> 02:19:40,594
where the wind sometimes
stops blowing for days on end.

1171
02:19:40,722 --> 02:19:42,679
Not a breath of air!

1172
02:19:48,522 --> 02:19:53,062
And when we cross the equator,

1173
02:19:54,653 --> 02:19:57,611
the captain
will open a vat of wine for us all.

1174
02:19:59,574 --> 02:20:03,067
Six to eight weeks later

1175
02:20:03,203 --> 02:20:07,447
we reach Bahia,
passing by Pernambuco,

1176
02:20:09,376 --> 02:20:10,912
just here.

1177
02:20:12,129 --> 02:20:14,837
Through the porthole

1178
02:20:14,965 --> 02:20:19,334
you can see the vast forests that
come right down to the water's edge.

1179
02:20:19,469 --> 02:20:22,678
And marvel at
one or two tribes of Indians

1180
02:20:22,806 --> 02:20:26,049
who have never seen
a four-mast schooner like ours.

1181
02:20:26,184 --> 02:20:29,552
Then onwards, further south,
to our destination:

1182
02:20:29,688 --> 02:20:32,521
Porto Alegre.

1183
02:20:35,944 --> 02:20:38,356
Once there,
we'll have reached eternal summer.

1184
02:20:39,322 --> 02:20:42,735
No sign of winter,
even at Christmas.

1185
02:20:44,036 --> 02:20:45,618
And we're never coming back?

1186
02:20:49,875 --> 02:20:51,331
On the thirteenth day of August,

1187
02:20:51,460 --> 02:20:55,670
the news of mother's haemorrhage
alarmed me greatly.

1188
02:20:58,633 --> 02:21:01,421
With the image of
my dying mother before my eyes,

1189
02:21:01,553 --> 02:21:03,544
I ran not for my life, but for hers.

1190
02:21:18,487 --> 02:21:20,398
It seemed to me that if I defied nature

1191
02:21:20,530 --> 02:21:24,398
and accomplished the journey
across mountains and streams,

1192
02:21:24,534 --> 02:21:26,400
through woods and thickets
without rest or fresh water,

1193
02:21:26,536 --> 02:21:29,073
then that might suffice
to ward off the hand of death.

1194
02:21:29,956 --> 02:21:32,539
I wagered the only thing I had:

1195
02:21:32,667 --> 02:21:35,750
my belief that I could save
my beloved mother.

1196
02:22:00,237 --> 02:22:03,150
- How is my mother?
- You can't go in, the doctor's with her.

1197
02:22:03,281 --> 02:22:05,898
- But she may need me.
- Who knows?

1198
02:22:06,034 --> 02:22:08,571
Help me shoe the doctor's horse.

1199
02:22:10,205 --> 02:22:12,037
Father, Jakob's back.

1200
02:22:19,965 --> 02:22:22,047
Good day, father. How's mother?

1201
02:22:22,175 --> 02:22:23,916
You know how to do it.

1202
02:23:36,541 --> 02:23:38,657
She's breathing freely again.

1203
02:23:38,793 --> 02:23:41,285
It's like I said. The lungs.

1204
02:23:42,130 --> 02:23:44,792
Come away, it's no sight for you.

1205
02:23:49,638 --> 02:23:52,346
Like I said. The lungs!

1206
02:24:03,985 --> 02:24:06,352
If only I could help your mother

1207
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:09,647
like you minister to my horse.

1208
02:24:11,409 --> 02:24:13,150
I'm in your debt, you know.

1209
02:24:15,247 --> 02:24:18,410
Your mother's lungs
have been rattling for years.

1210
02:24:18,541 --> 02:24:23,081
Hard labor night and day, and nothing
to eat but curds and mashed potato.

1211
02:24:26,967 --> 02:24:31,052
Consumption battens on hunger.

1212
02:24:31,179 --> 02:24:33,671
I have had as many
as ten cases in some villages.

1213
02:24:35,475 --> 02:24:37,341
There is only one remedy:

1214
02:24:38,311 --> 02:24:42,054
fresh air, sunshine,

1215
02:24:43,191 --> 02:24:46,434
and rest, rest and more rest.

1216
02:24:47,487 --> 02:24:49,524
Square meals too,

1217
02:24:49,656 --> 02:24:51,488
but you know that.

1218
02:24:53,410 --> 02:24:57,324
I don't know
where you're going to get them from,

1219
02:24:57,455 --> 02:24:59,071
but you must.

1220
02:25:01,584 --> 02:25:05,418
At least there's a young woman
in the house now to do the work.

1221
02:25:15,223 --> 02:25:19,433
After the comet,
spring came much later than usual.

1222
02:25:20,562 --> 02:25:24,681
The cherry trees
blossomed with the chestnut trees,

1223
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:34,319
it was August
before the flax came out.

1224
02:25:34,451 --> 02:25:36,442
And last year that plague of sparrows.

1225
02:25:38,621 --> 02:25:40,282
Everything is out of joint.

1226
02:26:20,205 --> 02:26:22,196
Mother's bedded down in the kitchen.

1227
02:26:26,252 --> 02:26:27,742
Gran is with her.

1228
02:26:28,797 --> 02:26:30,504
She's asleep now.

1229
02:26:50,902 --> 02:26:52,688
She called for you.

1230
02:27:04,833 --> 02:27:07,700
- Where shall we put her?
- I don't know.

1231
02:27:08,962 --> 02:27:10,418
What do you say?

1232
02:27:10,547 --> 02:27:12,709
In the field, down there?

1233
02:27:16,511 --> 02:27:20,129
That storm yesterday
has left much havoc.

1234
02:27:23,351 --> 02:27:24,933
This is a good place.

1235
02:27:30,358 --> 02:27:33,476
- Breathe deeply, in and out!
- Come on.

1236
02:28:43,389 --> 02:28:45,847
Mother, what's wrong?
Mother?

1237
02:28:48,895 --> 02:28:50,260
Mother!

1238
02:28:53,066 --> 02:28:56,434
I just saw all the children
the Lord God took from me.

1239
02:28:58,738 --> 02:29:01,480
All your little brothers and sisters.

1240
02:29:03,952 --> 02:29:04,942
Tony,

1241
02:29:06,246 --> 02:29:08,362
dead in his cot.

1242
02:29:10,833 --> 02:29:13,575
Freda, my first little girl,

1243
02:29:13,711 --> 02:29:18,046
who was only three when she died,
in that cold winter of 1816.

1244
02:29:20,301 --> 02:29:21,712
Anna,

1245
02:29:22,428 --> 02:29:24,339
who came into the world
all blue in the face,

1246
02:29:28,268 --> 02:29:30,885
little Sebastian
with his pale blue eyes

1247
02:29:31,813 --> 02:29:33,724
and his lovely laugh.

1248
02:29:37,610 --> 02:29:39,192
Katie,

1249
02:29:41,197 --> 02:29:43,108
burning up with fever

1250
02:29:44,284 --> 02:29:46,946
all the year round, every single day.

1251
02:29:50,873 --> 02:29:52,204
And Hans,

1252
02:29:55,169 --> 02:29:57,206
whose lungs caused him
so much anguish

1253
02:29:57,338 --> 02:30:02,333
until that dreadful, lovely day in summer
when he couldn't get up any more.

1254
02:30:05,638 --> 02:30:07,970
Six children, big and small.

1255
02:30:09,892 --> 02:30:13,101
I just saw them all with my own eyes,

1256
02:30:18,067 --> 02:30:23,107
waving to me from the other side.

1257
02:31:15,083 --> 02:31:17,916
I have heard of a secret place,

1258
02:31:19,587 --> 02:31:22,545
a land hidden
in the jungles of Amazonia

1259
02:31:22,674 --> 02:31:25,837
that bestows its paradise delights

1260
02:31:25,968 --> 02:31:31,213
only on those who go there free
of all cupidity, pure at heart

1261
02:31:31,349 --> 02:31:34,717
and mindful of their duties
to father and mother.

1262
02:31:37,772 --> 02:31:41,060
But mother's illness
and the hardships of this winter

1263
02:31:41,192 --> 02:31:44,856
are so dreadful as to
stifle all faith in any El Dorado.

1264
02:31:45,571 --> 02:31:50,281
They thrust us into the cold muck,
blameless though we be and pure at heart.

1265
02:31:51,703 --> 02:31:53,819
Set down with icy fingers

1266
02:31:53,955 --> 02:31:58,415
in the winter of our distress,
the year of the comet, 1843.

1267
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:06,081
They're all doomed
up there in the Hunsrück.

1268
02:32:07,510 --> 02:32:09,171
How could they survive?

1269
02:32:09,303 --> 02:32:11,135
We have each other.

1270
02:32:11,973 --> 02:32:15,341
Every night I think of mother and father
and my brothers.

1271
02:32:16,436 --> 02:32:18,643
Religions are the Devil's invention.

1272
02:32:18,771 --> 02:32:21,479
They only cause strife in the world.

1273
02:32:34,495 --> 02:32:36,987
It is futile!

1274
02:32:37,915 --> 02:32:41,078
For hours on end
I drove through the villages,

1275
02:32:41,210 --> 02:32:44,328
not a soul to be seen,

1276
02:32:45,506 --> 02:32:47,497
not even a dog in the road.

1277
02:32:47,633 --> 02:32:50,921
It's not the cold. It's fear.

1278
02:32:51,971 --> 02:32:54,588
They shut themselves in
because they're afraid.

1279
02:32:54,724 --> 02:32:57,307
But death gets through all doors.

1280
02:32:57,435 --> 02:33:01,804
Today four more children choked to death.
There was nothing I could do.

1281
02:33:04,567 --> 02:33:08,276
Not even prayer
helps against diphtheria.

1282
02:33:08,404 --> 02:33:11,271
Dead children everywhere,

1283
02:33:12,074 --> 02:33:14,907
seven in one night in Schabbach,

1284
02:33:15,661 --> 02:33:17,652
and four in Kirchweiler.

1285
02:33:17,789 --> 02:33:25,207
Sometimes I think I may be spreading
the disease myself with my visits.

1286
02:33:33,346 --> 02:33:37,556
Sunday last, toward the seventh hour
of the morning,

1287
02:33:37,683 --> 02:33:42,223
Gustav and Henriette's little girl
died of diphtheria in her mother's arms,

1288
02:33:42,355 --> 02:33:46,974
smothered by a scourge that had already
sought to carry us off in our childhood.

1289
02:33:48,110 --> 02:33:51,398
We can gird our loins
against all enemies

1290
02:33:51,531 --> 02:33:55,650
save death,
that gaunt and grinning specter

1291
02:33:56,202 --> 02:33:59,115
that has wormed its way
into our homes

1292
02:33:59,247 --> 02:34:01,329
and will not budge an inch.

1293
02:34:01,457 --> 02:34:04,040
At the last,
we will be forced to take flight,

1294
02:34:04,168 --> 02:34:06,910
if we want to escape from this hell.

1295
02:34:26,607 --> 02:34:29,599
Where are the parents? It's time.

1296
02:34:29,735 --> 02:34:32,693
<i>Get up, do!</i>

1297
02:34:32,822 --> 02:34:35,610
There's no help for it.

1298
02:34:37,159 --> 02:34:40,652
Gustav, who'll be carrying
the little one?

1299
02:34:40,788 --> 02:34:42,870
<i>We two.</i>

1300
02:34:42,999 --> 02:34:45,115
- Father'?
- Come here!

1301
02:34:46,168 --> 02:34:49,001
Take the cross and go on in front.

1302
02:35:06,939 --> 02:35:08,725
They're waiting.

1303
02:37:00,344 --> 02:37:04,633
For the first time
in human recollection,

1304
02:37:04,765 --> 02:37:07,928
the frost has penetrated
further into the ground

1305
02:37:08,060 --> 02:37:10,552
than the earth consecrated
for our graves.

1306
02:37:10,688 --> 02:37:16,309
So we shall take leave of the souls
of our little children here on this spot,

1307
02:37:16,444 --> 02:37:19,186
in memory of Christ's agony.

1308
02:37:21,949 --> 02:37:24,737
Then we shall accompany their bodies
across the bridge to the cemetery,

1309
02:37:24,869 --> 02:37:29,204
where we shall guard over them
with a constant vigil

1310
02:37:29,331 --> 02:37:32,073
until winter's dreadful fury is worn out

1311
02:37:32,209 --> 02:37:34,371
and the earth is set free to take them.

1312
02:37:34,503 --> 02:37:38,997
<i>The flowers slumber
through the night...</i>

1313
02:37:39,133 --> 02:37:43,923
Even in this, our great distress and trial,
God is hope for us all.

1314
02:37:45,973 --> 02:37:49,216
We Christians believe

1315
02:37:49,351 --> 02:37:53,686
that there is a better life to come
than this vale of tears on earth.

1316
02:37:53,814 --> 02:37:56,977
These little children
have not left us behind,

1317
02:37:57,109 --> 02:38:01,353
they have gone on before us
to the heavenly kingdom.

1318
02:38:01,489 --> 02:38:03,480
Before us, Pastor?

1319
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:06,532
Where to?

1320
02:38:07,661 --> 02:38:09,993
Is this what you call
the heavenly kingdom?

1321
02:38:11,123 --> 02:38:12,739
Hell is what it is.

1322
02:38:12,875 --> 02:38:15,037
<i>Hush, little baby...</i>

1323
02:38:15,169 --> 02:38:16,876
Sheer hell!

1324
02:38:17,004 --> 02:38:19,996
<i>...close your eyes</i>

1325
02:39:08,097 --> 02:39:10,338
- Can I help?
- Where do the Olms live?

1326
02:39:11,142 --> 02:39:12,678
They live opposite.

1327
02:39:16,522 --> 02:39:17,887
Letters for you.

1328
02:39:19,191 --> 02:39:20,522
Olm?

1329
02:39:20,651 --> 02:39:22,107
Sign here.

1330
02:40:07,448 --> 02:40:11,567
Go up into the classroom,
warm yourselves, put a log of wood on

1331
02:40:11,702 --> 02:40:14,569
and stay there until school is out.
And be careful of the fire!

1332
02:40:15,331 --> 02:40:17,789
- Ernst Bodtländer?
- At last!

1333
02:40:18,792 --> 02:40:21,580
Are the papers
for the blacksmith's son here too?

1334
02:40:21,712 --> 02:40:24,704
Yes, and for Heinrich Nauert
and his wife and daughter.

1335
02:40:45,361 --> 02:40:47,352
They're not moving.

1336
02:40:48,989 --> 02:40:50,070
It's like they were dead.

1337
02:40:51,617 --> 02:40:53,028
Gustav!

1338
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:54,650
Hetty!

1339
02:40:56,413 --> 02:40:57,903
Open the door!

1340
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:00,156
Gustav! Hetty!

1341
02:41:00,292 --> 02:41:02,704
- They've got to eat!
- Open the door!

1342
02:41:02,836 --> 02:41:05,077
I have something for Jakob.
Is he home?

1343
02:41:13,430 --> 02:41:15,467
I'll get my tools from the smithy.

1344
02:41:38,414 --> 02:41:41,532
I got my tools,
I'll break the door open.

1345
02:41:52,678 --> 02:41:54,635
The Key's in the lock.

1346
02:41:54,763 --> 02:41:56,379
I'll have to break it down.

1347
02:42:00,894 --> 02:42:02,510
Father.

1348
02:42:08,235 --> 02:42:09,725
God be praised!

1349
02:42:09,862 --> 02:42:13,150
We all have to live.
It's God's will.

1350
02:42:26,962 --> 02:42:29,624
The first day of February, 1844.

1351
02:42:30,841 --> 02:42:35,005
Six weeks or forty-one days till we
take leave of the land of our fathers.

1352
02:42:36,513 --> 02:42:40,427
This book has been
my true companion in the face of God.

1353
02:42:41,685 --> 02:42:43,722
Now the ocean awaits us.

1354
02:42:44,855 --> 02:42:49,349
The 280-ton, brand new,
eminently handsome,

1355
02:42:49,485 --> 02:42:52,978
copper-girded, three-mast packet boat
"Emilie" of Bremen,

1356
02:42:53,822 --> 02:42:56,280
captained by J. Meyerwind,

1357
02:42:56,408 --> 02:43:00,151
will set sail for Rio de Janeiro
on the fifteenth day of March.

1358
02:43:00,913 --> 02:43:04,406
The ship is built specially
for passenger travel,

1359
02:43:04,541 --> 02:43:10,082
has uncommonly generous
and extremely elegant cabins,

1360
02:43:10,214 --> 02:43:12,706
better described as staterooms,

1361
02:43:12,841 --> 02:43:15,208
and a very ample
and spacious between-deck

1362
02:43:15,344 --> 02:43:17,881
warmly recommended
for passenger use.

1363
02:43:26,772 --> 02:43:35,567
<i>Eternity, O thunderous word</i>

1364
02:43:35,697 --> 02:43:43,161
<i>O sword that pierces my soul</i>

1365
02:43:43,288 --> 02:43:49,409
<i>Beginning without end</i>

1366
02:43:50,212 --> 02:43:58,836
<i>Eternity, time without time</i>

1367
02:43:58,971 --> 02:44:06,685
<i>So heavy is my heart</i>

1368
02:44:06,812 --> 02:44:12,899
<i>I know not where to turn</i>

1369
02:44:13,902 --> 02:44:20,615
<i>My trembling heart so shudders</i>

1370
02:44:20,742 --> 02:44:29,708
<i>My tongue sticks to my teeth</i>

1371
02:44:36,717 --> 02:44:39,004
We thank Thee for Thy martyrdom,

1372
02:44:39,136 --> 02:44:40,626
for all the shame and fear

1373
02:44:40,762 --> 02:44:43,629
Thou withstood for us.

1374
02:44:43,765 --> 02:44:46,382
We are the cause of Thy misery.

1375
02:44:46,518 --> 02:44:50,182
Help us now, O Lord,
to acknowledge our sins

1376
02:44:50,314 --> 02:44:53,682
and be thankful for
Thy faithful charity.

1377
02:44:56,278 --> 02:44:57,985
What is it?

1378
02:45:15,214 --> 02:45:18,081
My wife Henriette and I have resolved,

1379
02:45:20,677 --> 02:45:25,672
after sober reflection
and without influence from others,

1380
02:45:25,807 --> 02:45:29,766
to leave our unhappy home for ever

1381
02:45:29,895 --> 02:45:31,636
and to emigrate to Brazil,

1382
02:45:37,277 --> 02:45:39,018
the country

1383
02:45:40,447 --> 02:45:43,155
where the roses bloom at Christmas.

1384
02:45:46,286 --> 02:45:48,323
So help us God.

1385
02:45:57,756 --> 02:45:59,246
Gustav!

1386
02:48:04,925 --> 02:48:06,086
Must you take everything?

1387
02:48:07,427 --> 02:48:08,792
I wanted to explain.

1388
02:48:08,929 --> 02:48:10,260
- Explain?
- Yes.

1389
02:48:10,389 --> 02:48:11,925
Explain that I have
to look after our parents,

1390
02:48:12,057 --> 02:48:15,800
that I can inherit the smithy,
that I can follow you out there later,

1391
02:48:15,936 --> 02:48:18,268
but not before I've started a family!
Was that it?

1392
02:48:18,980 --> 02:48:21,312
Well, it's true, isn't it?

1393
02:48:21,441 --> 02:48:23,023
No, it's not.

1394
02:48:23,151 --> 02:48:25,893
You sail for the New World unforgiven.

1395
02:48:26,530 --> 02:48:30,364
There is no pardon for the rift
you've driven between us!

1396
02:48:57,436 --> 02:49:01,430
Written in Schabbach
on the eighth day 0f July, 1844.

1397
02:49:02,983 --> 02:49:05,190
Today I shall close
my diary for all time

1398
02:49:05,318 --> 02:49:08,060
and conclude this account of all
my dreams that have come to nought.

1399
02:49:08,989 --> 02:49:12,903
As long as my parents live, I must stay
here and be the staff for them to lean on,

1400
02:49:13,034 --> 02:49:15,401
until the hour of their death,

1401
02:49:15,537 --> 02:49:19,371
and my thankful heart must go on beating,
stout and stalwart.

1402
02:49:20,667 --> 02:49:24,205
As I write this,
my friend Franz Olm and his family

1403
02:49:24,337 --> 02:49:27,079
are on the high seas
seas in the Bremen packet boat Emilie,

1404
02:49:27,758 --> 02:49:31,922
guided to its final haven
by Captain Meyerwind.

1405
02:49:35,390 --> 02:49:39,554
Our thoughts will meet
out there in the cosmos!

1406
02:49:39,686 --> 02:49:41,848
Jakob Adam Simon

1407
02:50:14,846 --> 02:50:17,304
And what if your father
sends us packing again?

1408
02:50:19,518 --> 02:50:23,182
If Gustav has gone on the Rhine steamer
at Bacharach, it's too late anyway.

1409
02:50:23,688 --> 02:50:26,771
It's four hours to Schabbach
and it's noon already.

1410
02:50:34,032 --> 02:50:37,241
I wanted to see Gustav and Henriette,
just one more time.

1411
02:50:39,830 --> 02:50:41,537
They're going for good.

1412
02:51:14,406 --> 02:51:16,147
We're almost there.

1413
02:51:18,535 --> 02:51:20,117
The cherry tree.

1414
02:51:31,256 --> 02:51:33,918
You've been so pale all day, mother.

1415
02:51:35,969 --> 02:51:38,882
- Where are we going?
- To the cherry tree.

1416
02:51:40,140 --> 02:51:41,756
Take your time!

1417
02:51:44,352 --> 02:51:45,763
Careful now!

1418
02:51:53,653 --> 02:51:55,690
You can turn her now.

1419
02:52:10,670 --> 02:52:12,832
Come on, sit her straight.

1420
02:52:16,092 --> 02:52:17,878
She'll be fine now.

1421
02:52:18,011 --> 02:52:19,547
That's it.

1422
02:52:21,681 --> 02:52:24,093
- Gustav.
- Yes, mother.

1423
02:52:26,770 --> 02:52:30,434
- I want you to promise me something.
- I surely will.

1424
02:52:32,233 --> 02:52:35,316
Write and tell us when you get there.

1425
02:52:36,404 --> 02:52:38,020
I promise.

1426
02:52:39,366 --> 02:52:40,902
Tell us

1427
02:52:42,243 --> 02:52:44,280
you're well.

1428
02:52:45,163 --> 02:52:48,406
I promise, mother, by all that's holy.

1429
02:52:55,590 --> 02:52:56,876
What ails you?

1430
02:53:02,973 --> 02:53:04,179
Mother!

1431
02:53:04,307 --> 02:53:06,264
Jakob, hold her!

1432
02:53:06,393 --> 02:53:09,681
Mother?
What's the matter with her, Jakob?

1433
02:53:13,942 --> 02:53:17,606
- I'm going for help.
- Mother, calm down.

1434
02:53:18,571 --> 02:53:21,154
Calm down.

1435
02:53:21,282 --> 02:53:22,738
Mother!

1436
02:53:23,159 --> 02:53:26,823
Calm yourself, mother.
I'm here with you. Mother!

1437
02:53:28,707 --> 02:53:31,790
Mother!

1438
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:34,542
Mother! Mother!

1439
02:53:35,463 --> 02:53:37,420
Wake up! Mother!

1440
02:53:38,383 --> 02:53:40,090
Mother...

1441
02:53:46,558 --> 02:53:49,641
Our Father, which art in Heaven...

1442
02:53:51,312 --> 02:53:53,974
- Sophie!
- Gustav, what's the matter?

1443
02:53:54,107 --> 02:53:56,064
Mother's in a bad way.

1444
02:54:12,250 --> 02:54:14,708
She can't get her breath.

1445
02:54:14,836 --> 02:54:18,955
Who can help us?
She's out in the fields with Jakob.

1446
02:54:20,008 --> 02:54:22,545
- Maybe she's...
- No, no...

1447
02:54:22,677 --> 02:54:25,385
No, Gustav,
we were almost gone.

1448
02:54:29,851 --> 02:54:33,264
Dear God,
let mother live a little longer!

1449
02:54:45,784 --> 02:54:48,867
Where is she?
Where's Margret?

1450
02:54:48,995 --> 02:54:51,908
Out in the fields.

1451
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:55,578
- I won't let this happen! Not today!
- I'll come too.

1452
02:54:55,710 --> 02:54:59,294
It would be awful if she died on us.

1453
02:54:59,422 --> 02:55:02,756
If she's not dead already,
we have to get her back home.

1454
02:55:10,350 --> 02:55:11,715
Jakob!

1455
02:55:14,020 --> 02:55:17,183
Mother!

1456
02:55:23,446 --> 02:55:24,732
Jakob!

1457
02:56:12,912 --> 02:56:15,904
Margret, bear up!

1458
02:56:17,125 --> 02:56:18,832
I'm almost there.

1459
02:56:27,844 --> 02:56:29,710
Mother!

1460
02:56:43,735 --> 02:56:45,146
Quick!

1461
02:56:58,833 --> 02:57:00,699
- Is she still alive?
- Yes.

1462
02:57:01,711 --> 02:57:03,622
We don't need you now.

1463
02:57:07,258 --> 02:57:11,126
It'd be a blow for the whole village.
Not just for you and Henriette.

1464
02:57:29,864 --> 02:57:31,229
Get out of the way!

1465
02:57:31,908 --> 02:57:34,149
- Put her down there.
- What's the matter with her?

1466
02:57:34,285 --> 02:57:36,868
The other way round.
With her head up there.

1467
02:57:39,874 --> 02:57:41,660
- I've got her.
- Let me do it.

1468
02:57:45,922 --> 02:57:47,708
Give me that pillow.

1469
02:57:49,926 --> 02:57:52,088
- Another pillow. Go and get a pillow!
- Another pillow?

1470
02:58:03,398 --> 02:58:05,480
You can go now.

1471
02:58:05,608 --> 02:58:07,690
- You too.
- Yes.

1472
02:58:07,819 --> 02:58:12,279
Henriette, hold her
so I can get at her back

1473
02:58:12,407 --> 02:58:14,364
and hear her lungs.

1474
02:58:14,492 --> 02:58:16,699
Keep her still. That's it.

1475
02:58:17,537 --> 02:58:21,201
Breathe nice and deep.

1476
02:58:29,173 --> 02:58:31,130
You can lie her down again.

1477
02:58:35,930 --> 02:58:38,797
When you emigrate,
you're never alone.

1478
02:58:38,933 --> 02:58:42,096
I got this list from
the district administrator's office.

1479
02:58:42,228 --> 02:58:47,769
There are 850 names on it
from the Koblenz region alone,

1480
02:58:47,900 --> 02:58:51,268
63 of them from around here.

1481
02:58:52,405 --> 02:58:53,770
Let's see.

1482
02:58:53,906 --> 02:58:55,988
We'll see them all on the boat.

1483
02:58:56,117 --> 02:59:00,327
I know where they come from,
how much property they have

1484
02:59:00,455 --> 02:59:03,493
and whether they are
law-abiding citizens or not.

1485
02:59:05,251 --> 02:59:08,039
You always were a little busybody.

1486
02:59:08,171 --> 02:59:10,253
Well, you can't be too careful.

1487
02:59:12,342 --> 02:59:14,128
Where's your father?

1488
02:59:22,560 --> 02:59:24,301
Has anyone seen father?

1489
02:59:24,437 --> 02:59:26,269
He'll be in the smithy.

1490
02:59:27,857 --> 02:59:30,349
All we can do now is wait.

1491
02:59:44,665 --> 02:59:46,121
Not so loud!

1492
02:59:47,085 --> 02:59:49,247
When you're grown up,

1493
02:59:49,379 --> 02:59:53,088
they'll take you
to a famous doctor in Mainz.

1494
02:59:53,216 --> 02:59:57,084
He'll grab your foot,
break it off, turn it round

1495
02:59:57,220 --> 03:00:00,212
and put it back on again
to grow properly.

1496
03:00:00,348 --> 03:00:04,262
And then you'll find
a handsome sweetheart to marry.

1497
03:00:04,394 --> 03:00:06,852
Break it off? I'd be scared!

1498
03:00:06,979 --> 03:00:09,346
No need for that.

1499
03:00:12,110 --> 03:00:15,728
Come on, help me make
some potato salad.

1500
03:00:15,863 --> 03:00:19,276
We need salt, bacon fat

1501
03:00:19,409 --> 03:00:21,571
and nutmeg.

1502
03:00:28,209 --> 03:00:31,247
In the language of the Cayucachua
there is a word

1503
03:00:31,379 --> 03:00:35,623
that means approximately
"return to the end of time".

1504
03:00:35,758 --> 03:00:37,544
Tapa-na-ma,

1505
03:00:37,677 --> 03:00:41,716
the arrow that flies back
to the archer's hand.

1506
03:00:41,848 --> 03:00:43,680
Tapa-na-ma.

1507
03:01:00,825 --> 03:01:05,410
Here I am, following time's arrow -
and my mother's breath.

1508
03:01:07,248 --> 03:01:09,740
Jakob! You're not at home?

1509
03:01:10,751 --> 03:01:13,743
- I'm going soon.
- But it's their last evening.

1510
03:01:13,880 --> 03:01:16,042
- I know.
- You've got to be there.

1511
03:01:16,174 --> 03:01:17,164
I know.

1512
03:01:18,217 --> 03:01:22,006
I'm taking Henriette
her trousseau for Brazil.

1513
03:01:24,557 --> 03:01:27,265
Wait for me!

1514
03:01:27,393 --> 03:01:29,100
Are you coming?

1515
03:01:32,607 --> 03:01:34,348
Hurry UP-

1516
03:01:54,754 --> 03:01:59,920
The progress of these last hours is
inevitable and aimless at the same time.

1517
03:02:00,927 --> 03:02:03,339
We can never know where there is
treasure to be found

1518
03:02:03,471 --> 03:02:07,180
or where happiness resides.

1519
03:02:09,143 --> 03:02:16,265
My father has always been sure
of what is right.

1520
03:02:16,400 --> 03:02:19,734
Now he has been assailed
by doubt and scrabbles for hidden gold

1521
03:02:19,862 --> 03:02:22,570
under the rotting boards
of his own floor.

1522
03:02:22,698 --> 03:02:25,690
But that gold exists only
in his poor distempered mind,

1523
03:02:25,826 --> 03:02:30,195
not in the castles and dungeons of
the robber barons and despots of yore.

1524
03:02:30,331 --> 03:02:31,742
Tapa na-ma.

1525
03:02:59,860 --> 03:03:01,316
Say something!

1526
03:03:02,363 --> 03:03:04,149
Where does it hurt?

1527
03:03:06,492 --> 03:03:09,735
Why did you go off like that
without saying anything?

1528
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:12,821
Have you found
the Highwayman's Treasure?

1529
03:03:12,957 --> 03:03:14,994
I just wanted to know.

1530
03:03:21,507 --> 03:03:23,089
Today of all days!

1531
03:03:24,343 --> 03:03:27,335
Tomorrow would have been too late.

1532
03:03:35,313 --> 03:03:39,682
A French lieutenant gave me this soap.

1533
03:03:39,817 --> 03:03:42,809
He was billeted with us
when the French were here.

1534
03:03:42,945 --> 03:03:45,152
I must have been nine or ten.

1535
03:03:45,281 --> 03:03:47,898
That was ages ago.
I bet it's lost its scent.

1536
03:03:48,576 --> 03:03:50,783
You have to spoil everything!

1537
03:03:50,911 --> 03:03:55,030
This bodice still fits.

1538
03:04:03,174 --> 03:04:06,007
I wish I could go with you to Brazil

1539
03:04:06,135 --> 03:04:08,126
and never come back.

1540
03:04:13,309 --> 03:04:17,268
Finest lace this is.

1541
03:04:18,731 --> 03:04:20,517
I made it myself.

1542
03:04:20,650 --> 03:04:22,232
Look!

1543
03:04:25,154 --> 03:04:27,191
Aren't they nice plates?

1544
03:04:27,323 --> 03:04:31,942
They say the upper classes
are very posh in Rio de Janeiro.

1545
03:04:32,953 --> 03:04:37,823
I wouldn't want my daughter feeling
ashamed because she comes from here.

1546
03:04:59,855 --> 03:05:02,017
Where's Henriette?

1547
03:05:40,980 --> 03:05:44,644
What are you doing?
You're supposed to take it easy.

1548
03:05:55,077 --> 03:05:56,909
This is our Gretchen.

1549
03:05:59,081 --> 03:06:01,413
Walter's outside on the cart.

1550
03:06:04,003 --> 03:06:05,914
What a beautiful girl.

1551
03:06:17,016 --> 03:06:19,098
And you're expecting another baby?

1552
03:06:39,538 --> 03:06:41,120
Lena?

1553
03:06:42,333 --> 03:06:45,291
Everything in its time.

1554
03:06:50,090 --> 03:06:51,956
I knew it.

1555
03:07:04,688 --> 03:07:06,770
You can't go on like this.

1556
03:07:22,331 --> 03:07:25,244
Tomorrow
would have been too late.

1557
03:07:34,051 --> 03:07:39,592
You thought,
if you found the treasure,

1558
03:07:39,723 --> 03:07:41,509
we'd stay here.

1559
03:07:44,603 --> 03:07:46,935
- Father!
- I just wanted to know.

1560
03:07:52,695 --> 03:07:55,403
- Johann!
- Over to the sink!

1561
03:07:55,531 --> 03:07:58,068
What are you doing?
Leave me alone!

1562
03:07:58,200 --> 03:08:01,283
It needs looking at.
ls that all right?

1563
03:08:02,746 --> 03:08:04,328
I know it hurts.

1564
03:08:15,217 --> 03:08:16,207
Lena?

1565
03:08:17,803 --> 03:08:20,670
- Didn't you see Walter, out on the cart?
- No.

1566
03:08:30,274 --> 03:08:31,764
Come on. Leave me be.

1567
03:08:32,318 --> 03:08:34,400
I want to have a wash.

1568
03:08:34,528 --> 03:08:36,644
Mother, give me some water.

1569
03:08:46,457 --> 03:08:48,039
I need a towel.

1570
03:09:08,896 --> 03:09:10,352
Let me see.

1571
03:09:20,449 --> 03:09:22,531
It's a Simon all right.

1572
03:09:27,748 --> 03:09:28,738
What's her name?

1573
03:09:29,917 --> 03:09:31,157
Gretchen.

1574
03:09:33,754 --> 03:09:35,336
And the boy?

1575
03:09:36,924 --> 03:09:38,756
We sometimes call him Hans,

1576
03:09:38,884 --> 03:09:40,841
if it's a boy.

1577
03:09:40,970 --> 03:09:43,428
It's a boy all right.

1578
03:09:53,399 --> 03:09:54,764
This is Walter.

1579
03:10:07,579 --> 03:10:10,697
I'm sorry. Make room!

1580
03:10:43,157 --> 03:10:44,613
Matilda!

1581
03:11:44,593 --> 03:11:46,925
Na ana mana sezu.

1582
03:11:49,181 --> 03:11:51,172
Na ana mana sezu.

1583
03:12:12,746 --> 03:12:13,952
Come on.

1584
03:12:21,755 --> 03:12:23,462
No one can hear us here.

1585
03:12:41,608 --> 03:12:45,476
Te-yu kam-si u-uklu tand-la-o.

1586
03:12:47,239 --> 03:12:50,322
- You remember that?
- Yes.

1587
03:12:51,702 --> 03:12:54,285
And I know exactly what it means.

1588
03:12:54,872 --> 03:12:57,534
Si u-uklu.

1589
03:12:57,666 --> 03:12:59,577
The secret.

1590
03:13:01,920 --> 03:13:04,332
I'll be gone tomorrow, Jakob.

1591
03:13:05,883 --> 03:13:07,544
Early.

1592
03:13:08,594 --> 03:13:10,050
Hold it up!

1593
03:13:21,773 --> 03:13:23,355
I'll let you.

1594
03:13:30,532 --> 03:13:32,398
Look in my eyes, Jakob,

1595
03:13:32,534 --> 03:13:34,195
look in my eyes!

1596
03:13:36,163 --> 03:13:39,281
Stay like that. Nice and slow.

1597
03:13:41,335 --> 03:13:42,917
Can you hold it?

1598
03:13:47,216 --> 03:13:48,706
I'm with you.

1599
03:14:37,766 --> 03:14:42,101
The passports, the confirmation
of release from Prussian nationality,

1600
03:14:43,522 --> 03:14:46,139
the certificates of good character
for you and me,

1601
03:14:47,484 --> 03:14:51,773
reservation of passage from Rotterdam

1602
03:14:51,905 --> 03:14:57,071
to Rio de Janeiro and from there
to Porto Alegre, plus receipt of payment,

1603
03:15:01,748 --> 03:15:05,241
and the passenger tickets
from the steamer company

1604
03:15:05,377 --> 03:15:07,960
for the lower and central Rhine
to Rotterdam.

1605
03:15:11,383 --> 03:15:15,718
Then they add the donation from
the Brazilian ambassador in Hamburg.

1606
03:15:18,348 --> 03:15:19,804
Once again:

1607
03:15:19,933 --> 03:15:24,177
the passports, the release documents
from Prussian nationality,

1608
03:15:25,605 --> 03:15:28,267
the certificates of good character
for you and me...

1609
03:15:30,527 --> 03:15:32,564
...born in Schabbach,

1610
03:15:33,864 --> 03:15:37,607
district of Simmern,
residing in Schabbach with his wife,

1611
03:15:37,743 --> 03:15:43,284
Henriette Simon,
née Niem, 19 years old,

1612
03:15:43,415 --> 03:15:46,077
to emigrate to Brazil.

1613
03:15:50,172 --> 03:15:54,086
This passport must be shown
to the police authorities

1614
03:15:54,217 --> 03:16:00,429
in all places where the holder
remains for longer than 24 hours,

1615
03:16:00,557 --> 03:16:04,892
with no distinction between states.

1616
03:16:06,438 --> 03:16:12,480
Look, Henriette: "All persons
listed here receive the assurance

1617
03:16:12,611 --> 03:16:16,570
"that when once they have been issued
their release papers by their present..."

1618
03:16:16,698 --> 03:16:18,029
I can't read that.

1619
03:16:18,158 --> 03:16:24,074
"...or their government,
then they will become...

1620
03:16:25,165 --> 03:16:28,203
"citizens of the Empire of Brazil."

1621
03:16:51,274 --> 03:16:52,890
Mother.

1622
03:17:18,969 --> 03:17:20,585
Those that go away,

1623
03:17:20,720 --> 03:17:25,510
my brother and all the neighbours
so soon to bid us farewell forever,

1624
03:17:25,642 --> 03:17:28,680
will blench anon at the desire to stay

1625
03:17:28,812 --> 03:17:31,304
that will seize them covertly
in the last hour before they leave.

1626
03:17:32,149 --> 03:17:36,268
Yet go they must,
and tear out their hearts,

1627
03:17:36,403 --> 03:17:39,395
and never grieve
for what they have left behind.

1628
03:17:46,830 --> 03:17:48,412
Morning!

1629
03:17:56,590 --> 03:17:57,751
Morning.

1630
03:18:06,349 --> 03:18:07,931
Come here.

1631
03:18:12,022 --> 03:18:14,764
Stand still. And turn.

1632
03:19:33,562 --> 03:19:35,428
Come on.

1633
03:19:35,564 --> 03:19:37,430
Drink!

1634
03:19:38,483 --> 03:19:40,019
You too.

1635
03:20:40,003 --> 03:20:43,337
Maybe you have no use for it,

1636
03:20:43,465 --> 03:20:46,423
but I've brought you
a little sack of Hunsrück earth.

1637
03:20:48,762 --> 03:20:52,005
You can grow some flowers in it
when you're in Brazil

1638
03:20:52,140 --> 03:20:54,802
to remind you of us, if you want.

1639
03:20:56,561 --> 03:20:57,596
Thank you, Florine.

1640
03:21:16,790 --> 03:21:18,781
Father, mother,

1641
03:21:20,293 --> 03:21:22,534
I'll not be long gone.

1642
03:21:23,713 --> 03:21:28,378
I offered the wagoner in Gehwiller that I'd
bring back the horses and the empty cart.

1643
03:21:29,511 --> 03:21:31,297
Someone has to do it.

1644
03:21:35,225 --> 03:21:39,264
Is that true, Jakob?
Or are you going too?

1645
03:21:39,396 --> 03:21:41,012
I'll be back, never fear!

1646
03:21:45,694 --> 03:21:47,025
Hammer.

1647
03:21:47,153 --> 03:21:48,393
Wrench.

1648
03:21:48,530 --> 03:21:51,739
Henriette.

1649
03:21:52,659 --> 03:21:55,242
Henriette, my only solace!

1650
03:21:55,370 --> 03:21:59,159
Don't leave me! You can't leave
your poor mother all alone!

1651
03:21:59,290 --> 03:22:01,952
Who'll sit with me when I'm dying?

1652
03:22:03,586 --> 03:22:06,954
If the ship sinks,
it'll be the end of me.

1653
03:22:07,090 --> 03:22:09,878
- Stay with me! Stay with me!
- Mother!

1654
03:22:10,009 --> 03:22:12,125
Stay with me.

1655
03:22:14,347 --> 03:22:18,136
- That's enough, mother!
- Don't go!

1656
03:22:23,648 --> 03:22:25,730
Gee up!

1657
03:23:27,879 --> 03:23:31,918
<i>Farewell, beloved home of you're</i>

1658
03:23:34,511 --> 03:23:37,879
<i>I must go down to the sandy shore</i>

1659
03:23:41,142 --> 03:23:45,010
<i>I'm off to places strange and new</i>

1660
03:23:47,398 --> 03:23:52,518
<i>Farewell, my home, forget me not</i>

1661
03:23:55,657 --> 03:23:59,742
<i>Remember me, at least a while</i>

1662
03:24:00,787 --> 03:24:06,248
<i>My lass, be true, save me a smile</i>

1663
03:24:09,379 --> 03:24:15,091
<i>I have no choice, it is my lot</i>

1664
03:24:15,218 --> 03:24:20,679
<i>Farewell, my home, forget me not</i>

1665
03:26:33,147 --> 03:26:34,603
Post scriptum.

1666
03:26:35,858 --> 03:26:37,474
We live more than once.

1667
03:26:39,112 --> 03:26:43,071
He who has weathered
the stormy waves of life

1668
03:26:43,199 --> 03:26:46,317
will gladly follow me
to the thickened forests,

1669
03:26:46,452 --> 03:26:50,411
through the endless steppes and
across the mighty backs of the Andes.

1670
03:26:54,752 --> 03:26:57,961
And the worldly spirit will tell him:

1671
03:26:58,089 --> 03:27:01,878
In the pursuit of science is freedom.

1672
03:27:24,198 --> 03:27:27,281
Father! I have the answer!

1673
03:27:28,202 --> 03:27:32,116
- We must build a centrifugal governor.
- A what?

1674
03:27:32,248 --> 03:27:34,831
A centrifugal governor.
It's in this book.

1675
03:27:37,295 --> 03:27:38,956
Look.

1676
03:27:39,088 --> 03:27:42,956
"Centrifugal force activates
a joint-and-lever mechanism

1677
03:27:43,092 --> 03:27:47,302
"that throttles the steam pressure when
the machine starts running too fast.

1678
03:27:47,430 --> 03:27:52,925
"Otherwise it would rotate at
maximum speed until it destroyed itself."

1679
03:27:53,061 --> 03:27:55,723
Now we know what Gustav did wrong.

1680
03:27:58,441 --> 03:28:01,433
- Centrifugal governor?
- Centrifugal governor!

1681
03:28:01,569 --> 03:28:03,151
We can make it ourselves.

1682
03:28:03,905 --> 03:28:06,988
Or rather... you make it,

1683
03:28:07,116 --> 03:28:09,153
and I'll tell you if it's right or not.

1684
03:28:14,248 --> 03:28:15,238
Mother?

1685
03:28:20,254 --> 03:28:22,336
I've got something to say to you.

1686
03:28:22,465 --> 03:28:24,627
I've just been telling father
about centrifugal governor.

1687
03:28:24,759 --> 03:28:26,875
Be quiet and listen!

1688
03:28:27,011 --> 03:28:28,547
What is it?

1689
03:28:31,140 --> 03:28:32,630
I've been thinking.

1690
03:28:33,893 --> 03:28:35,884
Maybe you should marry.

1691
03:28:43,069 --> 03:28:45,606
Are you quite right in the head?

1692
03:28:47,865 --> 03:28:50,027
I know what I'm saying.

1693
03:28:51,953 --> 03:28:55,071
Who am I supposed to marry?

1694
03:29:01,963 --> 03:29:04,170
Florine is a dear girl.

1695
03:29:07,677 --> 03:29:10,965
- And she has a lovely singing voice.
- Florine?

1696
03:29:11,097 --> 03:29:13,464
She hardly knows me at all.

1697
03:29:15,101 --> 03:29:17,388
She comes by every week

1698
03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:19,852
and asks what my Jakob is doing.

1699
03:29:21,566 --> 03:29:23,773
And what do you tell her?

1700
03:29:25,945 --> 03:29:28,027
That you're always on your own.

1701
03:29:30,533 --> 03:29:34,993
And then she says
she's all on her own too.

1702
03:29:36,455 --> 03:29:38,287
I can't think of marrying!

1703
03:29:38,416 --> 03:29:40,532
I'm corresponding with this famous
privy councillor in Berlin.

1704
03:29:40,668 --> 03:29:45,333
He made a mistake and I proved it!
He wants to know how I got the idea.

1705
03:29:45,464 --> 03:29:46,704
In this book he says

1706
03:29:46,841 --> 03:29:49,583
the languages of the Cayucachua
and the Xancarao are different dialects,

1707
03:29:49,719 --> 03:29:53,178
but they're not,
they're languages in their own right.

1708
03:29:53,306 --> 03:29:56,173
He said I was wrong,
and we've been exchanging letters.

1709
03:29:56,309 --> 03:29:58,141
Since Christmas!

1710
03:29:58,269 --> 03:29:59,851
On my own?

1711
03:29:59,979 --> 03:30:01,515
I'm not.

1712
03:30:02,398 --> 03:30:05,766
Mother, don't you understand?
I'm not on my own.

1713
03:30:08,154 --> 03:30:10,316
Such a lovely voice.

1714
03:30:27,548 --> 03:30:29,414
Do you really think so?

1715
03:30:30,885 --> 03:30:32,216
<i>Yes.</i>

1716
03:31:28,025 --> 03:31:29,891
Northerly direction.

1717
03:31:31,988 --> 03:31:33,444
Synchronize!

1718
03:31:36,701 --> 03:31:38,237
The reading is accurate!

1719
03:31:38,369 --> 03:31:41,282
Take up your position
at the edge of the field.

1720
03:31:49,547 --> 03:31:50,628
Stop!

1721
03:32:06,480 --> 03:32:10,644
Tell me, my good man,
what is the name of that place?

1722
03:32:10,776 --> 03:32:13,438
Over there? That's Schabbach.

1723
03:32:14,155 --> 03:32:15,611
Benjamin!

1724
03:32:39,972 --> 03:32:43,966
Father, that means we have
a machine that can look after itself.

1725
03:32:44,101 --> 03:32:45,842
You can leave it to run all on its own.

1726
03:32:47,480 --> 03:32:49,312
I'm proud of you.

1727
03:32:53,486 --> 03:32:56,695
Start her up.
I want to try it out.

1728
03:33:35,861 --> 03:33:37,693
Come a little closer.

1729
03:33:40,282 --> 03:33:42,865
Do you know a certain Jakob Simon?

1730
03:33:44,578 --> 03:33:46,819
What do you want from my husband?

1731
03:34:04,223 --> 03:34:06,180
I am speechless.

1732
03:34:19,488 --> 03:34:21,604
Give me pen and paper!

1733
03:35:11,415 --> 03:35:13,827
"Esteemed Jakob Simon!

1734
03:35:14,585 --> 03:35:17,373
"On our way from Berlin to Paris,

1735
03:35:17,505 --> 03:35:21,920
"we would gladly have paid
our respects to a born master.

1736
03:35:22,051 --> 03:35:25,885
"But overawed by his own repute,
he has fled from our sight.

1737
03:35:27,348 --> 03:35:29,589
"Be true to science!

1738
03:35:30,392 --> 03:35:31,757
"My best regards.

1739
03:35:32,645 --> 03:35:34,556
"Alexander von Humboldt"

1740
03:35:36,440 --> 03:35:40,024
Letters from Berlin.
So it was true after all!

1741
03:35:58,754 --> 03:36:04,215
- How light you are. Like a bird.
- Stop it, you make me dizzy.

1742
03:36:04,343 --> 03:36:06,129
Soon you can fly.

1743
03:36:06,929 --> 03:36:08,761
I'm scared.

1744
03:36:30,578 --> 03:36:33,320
This is a lovely view.

1745
03:36:37,751 --> 03:36:40,459
Down there is Henriette's mother's mill.

1746
03:36:40,588 --> 03:36:43,797
Further off Gehwiller and Hene.

1747
03:36:43,924 --> 03:36:47,383
The whole world is at your feet.

1748
03:36:50,139 --> 03:36:55,225
I just need to close my eyes
and I can go anywhere.

1749
03:36:56,061 --> 03:36:57,597
Faraway countries,

1750
03:36:58,522 --> 03:37:00,934
unknown cities in the jungle,

1751
03:37:02,109 --> 03:37:04,225
the shores of the ocean.

1752
03:37:07,031 --> 03:37:09,147
If I could fly, Jakob...

1753
03:37:12,620 --> 03:37:14,486
do you know where I'd go?

1754
03:37:15,831 --> 03:37:17,947
To Brazil,

1755
03:37:18,083 --> 03:37:19,915
to see how Gustav is doing.

1756
03:37:20,878 --> 03:37:22,243
No.

1757
03:37:25,591 --> 03:37:27,081
To Hennwiller,

1758
03:37:28,469 --> 03:37:29,925
where we lived when I was small.

1759
03:37:30,512 --> 03:37:34,130
You don't have to fly
to go to Hennwiller.

1760
03:37:36,935 --> 03:37:39,222
At my age you do.

1761
03:37:49,239 --> 03:37:52,322
If only Gustav would write.

1762
03:37:55,079 --> 03:37:57,411
It's been 13 months.

1763
03:38:42,793 --> 03:38:44,204
Margarethe...

1764
03:38:45,879 --> 03:38:47,790
has stopped breathing.

1765
03:38:51,635 --> 03:38:53,592
Next to you in bed?

1766
03:38:55,139 --> 03:38:57,176
You don't need to look.

1767
03:38:57,850 --> 03:38:59,761
She's at peace now.

1768
03:39:02,104 --> 03:39:03,094
That's how it is.

1769
03:39:28,005 --> 03:39:30,622
I hope nothing's happened
to Gustav and Henriette.

1770
03:40:32,694 --> 03:40:35,152
Anyone home?

1771
03:40:35,280 --> 03:40:37,738
A letter for Simon.

1772
03:40:43,288 --> 03:40:46,121
Jakob! It's from Gustav!

1773
03:41:15,153 --> 03:41:17,144
"Dear family and friends back home.

1774
03:41:18,532 --> 03:41:22,196
"After almost 60 days at sea
we arrived in Rio de Janeiro.

1775
03:41:23,912 --> 03:41:27,121
"The passage was often hazardous.

1776
03:41:27,249 --> 03:41:30,116
"Seven children and three adults
died on board

1777
03:41:30,252 --> 03:41:32,289
"and were committed to the waves.

1778
03:41:32,421 --> 03:41:33,957
"With bribery the cook was persuaded

1779
03:41:34,089 --> 03:41:37,002
"to give some passengers
twice as much to eat

1780
03:41:37,134 --> 03:41:40,752
"and nothing to the others, although
the rations were agreed in the contract.

1781
03:41:42,890 --> 03:41:46,975
"On our arrival we were put into collective
accommodation for weeks on end.

1782
03:41:47,102 --> 03:41:50,060
"Our documents proved worthless there.

1783
03:41:50,188 --> 03:41:53,806
"But then Gustav
complained to the governor,

1784
03:41:53,942 --> 03:41:56,479
"and one of his agents
put us on a boat to Porto Alegre.

1785
03:41:58,906 --> 03:42:04,197
"Once there, another agent
showed us our land on a map

1786
03:42:04,328 --> 03:42:06,990
"and gave us documents of ownership.

1787
03:42:07,122 --> 03:42:11,912
"Most of it was jungle,
one very small part had been worked,

1788
03:42:12,044 --> 03:42:14,285
"then abandoned
and left to grow over again.

1789
03:42:16,632 --> 03:42:21,251
"We had to toil day and night to wrest
arable soil from that plot, inch by inch.

1790
03:42:22,930 --> 03:42:26,139
"Franz Olm and his family
live one day's journey away,

1791
03:42:26,266 --> 03:42:30,225
"his daughter Frieda
has gone into service in Porto Alegre.

1792
03:42:31,438 --> 03:42:34,851
"Ploughing their fields, the Olms
found agate and precious stones

1793
03:42:34,983 --> 03:42:37,975
"that they could have made
good use of at home.

1794
03:42:38,111 --> 03:42:39,772
"Tell my mother that.

1795
03:42:40,656 --> 03:42:44,900
"It has been six months now,
and things are looking up.

1796
03:42:44,993 --> 03:42:47,075
"The livestock
has finally been delivered.

1797
03:42:47,204 --> 03:42:49,741
"Gustav has 40 cows,

1798
03:42:49,873 --> 03:42:51,409
"124 acres of land,

1799
03:42:51,541 --> 03:42:55,205
"and the wooden house we have built
has a lock on the door.

1800
03:42:55,337 --> 03:42:57,248
"The snakes have been driven away.

1801
03:42:58,590 --> 03:43:00,922
"There is no sign of any natives,

1802
03:43:02,135 --> 03:43:05,002
"so I cannot try out
Jakob's message on them:

1803
03:43:08,266 --> 03:43:12,510
"Te-yu kam-si u-uklu tand-la-o."

1804
03:43:15,315 --> 03:43:17,101
That was Henriette.

1805
03:43:20,195 --> 03:43:21,777
This is from Gustav.

1806
03:43:25,951 --> 03:43:28,864
"Dear family, we are doing well.

1807
03:43:28,996 --> 03:43:30,782
"240 square yards of wheat
have taken root.

1808
03:43:30,914 --> 03:43:33,326
"On the eighth day of March
Henriette bore me a daughter.

1809
03:43:33,458 --> 03:43:35,825
"We have christened her Jakobine.

1810
03:43:37,170 --> 03:43:38,706
"A sturdy child,

1811
03:43:39,673 --> 03:43:43,837
"with God's succour she will grow up
a fine girl in this, our home from home.

1812
03:43:43,969 --> 03:43:46,757
"Remember us fondly!
Gustav and Henriette.

1813
03:43:48,807 --> 03:43:50,468
"We send our best greetings

1814
03:43:50,600 --> 03:43:53,888
"to mother, father,

1815

"Lena, her husband and grandmother.

"Tell Jakob to give our best wishes
to Lotte Niem and the Morsches

1817
03:44:02,237 --> 03:44:07,403
"and above all to Florine, and tell her
that her brothers are doing well.

03:44:08,326 --> 03:44:13,162
"They live 10 days' journey to the north
and have found work in a tannery.

1819
03:44:13,290 --> 03:44:17,784
"And remember us to Sophie and Margot,
and to all the neighbours,

1820

"the Nauerts and Linnemanns
in Schabbach

1821
03:44:20,422 --> 03:44:22,333
"and the Linnemanns in Kirchwiller."

1822
03:45:52,597 --> 03:46:00,186
In memory of my brother,
Guido Reitz (1946-2008). E.R.
