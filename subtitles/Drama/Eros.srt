1
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:31,385
Cloe,

2
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:35,280
Why do we talk in such a way?

3
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:36,451
This is what you said

4
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:39,809
Me?
Everything is my fault

5
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,504
Why do you blame me when the
relationship faced with problems?

6
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:45,998
What are you saying? Wish? Yes

7
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:48,493
I don't want to wish

8
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:50,522
And you always hope
your wish comes true

9
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,784
Why can't you accept the fact
that we've broken up?

10
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:58,140
This way, everything is understood,
we'll know what to do

11
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,572
If I've not mistaken,
you always want to make things clear

12
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:03,824
Isn't that correct?

13
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:06,221
Answer me!

14
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:09,255
Can we go now?

15
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:30,719
Thank you, Nuccio

16
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:00,753
Sing

17
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:54,602
Why haven't we been here before?

18
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,949
Not enough curiosity

19
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:06,207
Yes

20
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:26,673
Do you still remember
the beautiful things?

21
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:30,264
What do you want to remember,
the sun, the moon?

22
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:32,996
Don't you tell me suddenly
you've become a romantic person

23
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,819
I do all these things because
I don't want to be trapped in the past

24
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,384
This is a must

25
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:44,447
What I do remember is not the day,
but clouds

26
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:47,866
The sad feelings emerged
when summer came to the end

27
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,963
I don't want to be sad, that's why
sometimes I smile without reason

28
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:54,787
So, smile

29
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:17,123
How are you?

30
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:20,848
How are you?
- How are you?

31
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:23,809
Can I take 2 apples for the horse?
- Yes

32
00:10:24,242 --> 00:10:25,728
How are you?
- How are you?

33
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:30,688
Do you know her?

34
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:32,691
Who?

35
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:34,818
The girl who went out just now

36
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,443
The girl lives below the tower

37
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:49,143
Thank you

38
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:55,617
I like this location,
today I was sued

39
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:04,395
If you want personal space,
it's up to you

40
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:20,173
You're not allowed to talk in such a way,
who do you think you are?

41
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,337
You're silly
- Is that so?

42
00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:22,266
Yes!

43
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,527
Tell me what do we do the whole day
besides fighting, nothing else

44
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:29,521
What do you wanna do? Sex?
- Yes, sex

45
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:32,283
But make me happy,
sex is not an illusion

46
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:34,437
You think too much

47
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:36,698
Walk quickly!

48
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:43,153
I hate this, but I get it everytime

49
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,279
Isn't that funny?

50
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:49,306
You are always searching for purity

51
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,304
You are a hated person

52
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:57,821
I can't do anything
I like this

53
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:00,788
You like it?

54
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,380
Let us be here

55
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,395
What are you finding inside?

56
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:46,890
Yes

57
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:53,613
I like old things
- But I am young

58
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,078
I like it even more

59
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,356
Is this an invitation?

60
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:10,183
Hopes you like it

61
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,147
What?

62
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:15,740
Generally

63
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,148
I seems to know you for a long time

64
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,910
No

65
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:49,973
You're the opposite type

66
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:54,959
Other types

67
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:57,889
Who?

68
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,344
A saxophone player

69
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:05,069
I saw 2 butterflies near the beach

70
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,805
They're always following me

71
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:10,458
I'm sure you've met one of them

72
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:11,961
No

73
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:16,018
But I believes one of them is with us

74
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:19,017
You want us to find it?
- No

75
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,070
No?
- No

76
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,632
This is a message
- Message?

77
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:27,899
Might be a message related to 2 people

78
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:29,158
Maybe

79
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:58,635
I feel cold

80
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:03,619
Goodbye

81
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:06,087
Goodbye

82
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:09,737
Are you here?

83
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:32,500
If I throw it, what will happen?

84
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,768
Tell me your name.

85
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:21,700
My name is Linda

86
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:46,357
How are you?
- How are you?

87
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:03,416
Hello?

88
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,208
How are you?
- How are you?

89
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,269
Where are you?
- Beach

90
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:12,101
The horse has ran away,
I want to bring them back

91
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,791
I am looking at the snow
- Where?

92
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:18,622
Paris
- I can't hear you, where are you?

93
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:20,345
I am in Paris

94
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:23,180
Is it snowing there?

95
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:26,143
I hope it snows here too

96
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:28,301
Cleo, if you're saying this

97
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:31,273
You makes me want to go there

98
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:33,099
I hope to get close to you

99
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,164
But the way you analyse problems

100
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:39,285
Hello? I can't hear

101
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:41,780
I said the way you analyse problems

102
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:44,815
The way I analyse problems,
how do we change?

103
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,442
Forget it

104
00:24:47,415 --> 00:24:49,207
This is about searching

105
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:51,071
Foundation to something

106
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,894
Now I can't think of anything

107
00:24:55,236 --> 00:24:59,854
Snow makes me calm,
I'm nervous now

108
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:03,318
la might be your best friend today

109
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,366
Kiss you
- Me too

110
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:18,823
Let's go back!

111
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,816
I don't remember exactly
when it happened

112
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,383
It was 2 weeks ago

113
00:31:44,383 --> 00:31:47,432
Yesterday,
that was the day that I lost my...

114
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:51,123
It was the day after we're told we'll
be pitching this Samson's account

115
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:56,311
The copy guy comes in
and he's wearing a...

116
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,673
What's the socially acceptable term

117
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:05,027
Somebody encountered this trap,
kill it

118
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:08,255
We're shocked,
our molecules are moving

119
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:15,002
And before we processed this betrayal,
Howard says calmly

120
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:16,991
He decides to do something
about his hair problem

121
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:19,857
And he'll appreciate it if we kindly
refrain from making it

122
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:22,644
A topic of comment or conversation.

123
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:24,274
This is my team

124
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,126
Good people.
They're great at what they do

125
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:28,956
It's like Jazz

126
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:33,847
We can't talk about this tragedy
of Hallet's hair

127
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:37,930
I mean you should see him,
faces like starving animals

128
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:39,721
Look at me

129
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:46,838
Do something!

130
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,285
It is an alarm clock

131
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,972
They want a new concept
for their shitty little alarm

132
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:59,070
You know the, Samson,
'coz time is important to us

133
00:33:00,566 --> 00:33:05,314
We're polishing the vase
when the house falls down

134
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:10,965
- Do you've an alarm clock?
- I do. Yes.

135
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:14,292
- You happy with it?
- It does the job.

136
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,415
Right, but you need a new alarm clock,
Dr Pearl

137
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:18,842
And it's gotta be a Samson

138
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:21,298
A new colour, a new texture

139
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:26,122
You want softer kick

140
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:28,944
You wanna kick it off a night stand
every morning for a year, you can

141
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,066
Our mechanism is incredibly

142
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:36,249
You see what I'm saying?
The message is simple

143
00:33:37,454 --> 00:33:39,346
The life is lacking something

144
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:46,093
Pearl

145
00:33:46,427 --> 00:33:48,149
Yes, it's short for Dr Pearl

146
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:51,139
You're talking about alarm clocks

147
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:56,319
All around me, these other firms,
they can hit home-runs

148
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:57,818
Left
Right

149
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:02,873
Melt in your mouth, not your hand,
it's great!

150
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:05,334
Dollar for dollar

151
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:16,657
Any of 'ur patients famous?
- I can't discuss my patients

152
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:19,588
All right, no, I saw a sketch
about that one at a night club

153
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,231
Doctor patient,
patience, doctor

154
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:26,323
I remember that, I want to remember
the names, anything personal

155
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:31,072
Mr Penrox ain't

156
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,104
Do you remember Jack?

157
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:34,524
I really can't help you there

158
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:37,354
Oh my god,
their sales up to the roof

159
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:39,012
I have the data

160
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:44,626
Your sister mentioned something
about a recurring dream

161
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:47,582
The woman in the dream.

162
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,877
The woman in the dream,
why did you say it that way?

163
00:34:52,211 --> 00:34:53,639
Cecelia says it like that

164
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:56,497
Is Cecelia is your wife?
- Yeah

165
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,080
And you tell her about the dream?

166
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:05,101
I make the mistake of
mentioning it once

167
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:09,389
Now it has become a ritual,
it's a ritual

168
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:11,907
Until yesterday

169
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:14,865
What happened yesterday?

170
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:18,191
Yesterday I came down to the kitchen,
I was telling her about the dream

171
00:35:18,795 --> 00:35:21,413
The latest installment.
There was a woman in the dream

172
00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:25,900
When I wake up, I don't remember who
it is, but in the dream, I know her

173
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:29,352
It's not a sex dream

174
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,312
Exactly

175
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:37,304
But we're there and I said,
'Boy, who is it? '

176
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,749
Because I was thinking about it, I felt
like the air in the room has change

177
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:47,329
I look over and there she was,
shoulder shaking, she's crying

178
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:48,992
Why is she crying?

179
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:50,893
I don't know

180
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:52,716
Did you asked her?

181
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:55,673
She won't say it

182
00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:58,072
She is upset?

183
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:00,962
Yes

184
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:05,016
Have you given any
thought of sitting down?

185
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:12,063
I'm wondering if cavemen
sat around talking about their dreams

186
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:14,157
And having coded conversations
with their wives

187
00:36:14,157 --> 00:36:15,811
Over cold venison.

188
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:20,593
Do you often imagine
that you're a caveman?

189
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,994
No

190
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:25,479
I am happy with 1955

191
00:36:25,954 --> 00:36:30,270
Look at the advances
in medicine, polio, TB

192
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,821
That was a joke

193
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:38,515
So, how is it with Cecelia
since her crying in the kitchen?

194
00:36:38,515 --> 00:36:40,033
It's great

195
00:36:44,657 --> 00:36:46,843
She's like a nurse on the night
when I've my tonsils out

196
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:50,137
Civil and unavailable

197
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:56,909
And how long is it since
you've been having this dream?

198
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:57,972
That's the thing...

199
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:00,294
It was the night when Hallet show up
with a new on his head

200
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:05,088
They show the woman in the dream

201
00:37:06,052 --> 00:37:08,669
I've to show Cecelia
that I know the answer

202
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:10,502
Or she's gonna be gone

203
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:14,853
You've to help me, if this woman is
pulling away, I don't know what I'll do

204
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:17,606
So, I need to know the answer now

205
00:37:18,212 --> 00:37:21,293
Before I leave, I gotta know

206
00:37:23,727 --> 00:37:25,018
Mr Penrose

207
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,699
Human beings is not a car brake, I mean
we'll talk, we'll see what happens

208
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:33,586
Everybody is different.
You're under a lot of stress.

209
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,017
You're anxious about the job,
the recurring dream, the situation...

210
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:39,176
With your wife, you're much
more anxious than usual.

211
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:40,070
Exactly.

212
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:43,622
There're various ways I can try
to help you reduce 'ur anxiety.

213
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,445
First, I'll have you lie down
on the couch over here.

214
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:54,684
This couch?
Yes, right here

215
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:58,773
Just put 'ur head up on one end and
slide your feet down the other end

216
00:38:00,472 --> 00:38:01,797
This works for people, the couch?

217
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,453
I can tell you,
I've great success with this couch

218
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:12,758
Should I take my shoes off?
- Yes, whatever makes you comfortable

219
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:21,258
We want your mind completely clear

220
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:23,790
Should I close my eyes?
- I find that helps

221
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:25,820
'coz I see things in great details

222
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:52,663
Sometimes, I imagine myself
as a person with no responsibility

223
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,345
That's very interesting

224
00:38:57,948 --> 00:39:00,168
Part of me knows I enjoy it

225
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,552
Now, I want you to tell me
about your dream

226
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:04,981
Okay

227
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:08,603
But first, take a minute, go back
to the beginning of the dream

228
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:10,100
When you got there,

229
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:13,984
Just pause for a moment, and
hold the first image in your mind

230
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,550
We at the beginning?
- Yes.

231
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,001
Tell me the first thing
you see in the dream

232
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:27,201
A woman's face

233
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,623
Can you see the woman
in 'ur mind right now?

234
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:34,502
Yes.

235
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:37,864
Where are you? Are you very close
or are you far-away?

236
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:41,442
We've facing each other in bed.
It's right after

237
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,082
That's very close.

238
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,873
Think for a minute what it feels like

239
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:56,458
How do you feel?

240
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:03,894
Then what happens?

241
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:08,214
She looks at me with kinda funny smile

242
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:10,867
And goes off to the bathroom

243
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:15,154
Turns on the tub and lets it run

244
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,724
This is when I realised we've
been in this room before

245
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:27,538
Describe the room to me?

246
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,489
Feels like a hotel room

247
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:36,710
Doesn't feel like a place
where anybody live

248
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:40,722
The only person
belongs to us

249
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:45,052
So, when I hear the water running,
I think,

250
00:40:45,052 --> 00:40:49,163
I love it, that
she's gonna take a bath and I,

251
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:53,749
Begin to imagine her getting ready.

252
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:57,803
Taking off her make-up,
putting her hair up

253
00:40:58,702 --> 00:41:02,122
So excited thinking about it.

254
00:41:03,152 --> 00:41:08,192
When I hear her turn the water off,

255
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:11,912
I'm gonna go right
in the tub with her.

256
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:16,365
That's when the phone starts ringing.

257
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:23,135
- Who do you think might be calling?
- I don't know.

258
00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:27,658
Aren't you afraid of being discovered?
- No.

259
00:41:28,294 --> 00:41:30,343
Not even a slightest feel guilty?

260
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:34,471
- No.
- Not the tiniest bit?

261
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:35,864
No, no guilt whatsoever.

262
00:41:39,652 --> 00:41:41,169
Then what happened?

263
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:52,932
Got better things to do
than answering the phone

264
00:41:53,335 --> 00:41:54,694
She takes her bath

265
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,361
She gets up and dry herself up

266
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:06,408
She climbs up on the sink
in front of the mirror like a cat

267
00:42:06,642 --> 00:42:10,820
And puts on her make-up

268
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:13,310
She finishes and,

269
00:42:14,944 --> 00:42:17,400
Back in the bedroom,
I watched her as she,

270
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,492
Get dressed.

271
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:22,315
In the bathroom for a minute,
close the doors

272
00:42:25,768 --> 00:42:28,587
She comes back out in her living room

273
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:35,722
She puts her hand on my face

274
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:41,138
There is a glove on her hand.

275
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:43,324
She kisses me.

276
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,500
I just lay there for a minute.

277
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:55,288
Then the phone rings again, I got up

278
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:59,499
Answer it, but there's
no one at the other end

279
00:43:01,033 --> 00:43:04,010
- Then what happens?
- I wake up.

280
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:07,435
- Should I stop?
- No, no, stay in the dream.

281
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:21,976
I feel so sad.
Yes, you wanna be with her.

282
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:23,509
Yes.

283
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:28,128
Stay there on the bed.
You're in the dream now.

284
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:31,343
And I want you to go back.

285
00:43:31,681 --> 00:43:35,031
I want you to go back in the dream
when the woman is in the bathroom.

286
00:43:51,571 --> 00:43:55,223
The bathroom door is close?

287
00:43:55,223 --> 00:43:56,518
Yes.

288
00:43:56,518 --> 00:43:58,974
And you're lying on the bed?
- Yes.

289
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:12,478
Raise your head slowly, slowly

290
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:17,269
Where are you?
- I am standing.

291
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:19,295
And where is the purse?

292
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:21,783
The purse?

293
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:26,401
Yes, you said that when she sat down
next to you, she picked up a purse

294
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,005
- You see it?
- Yes.

295
00:44:35,435 --> 00:44:37,891
I want you to go to the purse.

296
00:44:43,669 --> 00:44:45,363
I can't.
- Why?

297
00:44:54,727 --> 00:44:57,410
You're in a very vulnerable
state right now,

298
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,831
It's crucial you do not feel
judged at this moment.

299
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:02,663
If you turn around,
any expression on my face,

300
00:45:02,663 --> 00:45:07,046
No matter how sympathetic
or supportive

301
00:45:07,046 --> 00:45:10,827
And I cannot allowed that,
I'll not allowed that.

302
00:45:14,384 --> 00:45:15,606
Thank you.

303
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:35,568
Let's go back to your work
for a while.

304
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,214
You feel as if
you've run out of ideas?

305
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,994
I feel like I've run out
of good ideas.

306
00:45:52,204 --> 00:45:53,596
Something is missing.

307
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:55,189
Yes.

308
00:45:56,386 --> 00:46:01,355
What is your favourite part
of the dream?

309
00:46:08,336 --> 00:46:10,588
When she standing at the door
while the phone rings

310
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,687
Why?

311
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,653
By standing at the door and
letting the phone rings,

312
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:22,502
She's keeping outside world
away for a minute.

313
00:46:25,498 --> 00:46:28,576
That's where I screw up, I answer
the phone and the dream ends

314
00:46:28,684 --> 00:46:32,124
Maybe if I didn't answer the phone,
she'll come back

315
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,617
So, the phone is an interruption
from the outside world.

316
00:46:36,617 --> 00:46:37,544
Yes.

317
00:46:37,779 --> 00:46:41,027
Like the alarm clock.

318
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,378
Maybe.

319
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:03,201
You hear the alarm clock
in the morning, what happens?

320
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:06,715
I turn it off.
- Yes, but what did you wanna do?

321
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:08,638
Go back to sleep.

322
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:13,197
- Why don't you?
- If I don't get up,

323
00:47:13,794 --> 00:47:16,081
I'll fall back to sleep
and I will be late for work.

324
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,226
Yes, yes, but you just want a few
more moments of sleep, just a few.

325
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:23,915
You've to reset the entire alarm

326
00:47:24,152 --> 00:47:26,505
And the setting mechanism
isn't that precise.

327
00:47:27,935 --> 00:47:29,519
What'll solve the problem then?

328
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:35,570
You've to turn the alarm off, and then
turn it off again automatically

329
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,437
I actually think I would.

330
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:09,256
Samson,
the alarm clock of your dreams.

331
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,502
Sounds like one of those good ideas.

332
00:48:17,946 --> 00:48:19,405
Can I get up now?

333
00:48:20,402 --> 00:48:21,420
Absolutely.

334
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,166
Feeling better?

335
00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:28,795
Yes.

336
00:48:32,051 --> 00:48:33,843
I feel like we've accomplished
something today.

337
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:49,005
No need to thanked me.
The work is an honourable reward.

338
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,963
Breakthrough is exhausting.

339
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,308
I feel really tired all of a sudden.

340
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,624
Are you all right?
- I feel like I can lay down again

341
00:49:09,652 --> 00:49:13,691
You've some time left on your hour.

342
00:49:24,853 --> 00:49:25,509
Thank you.

343
00:50:53,045 --> 00:50:54,335
Are you up?

344
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,110
You must have hit the alarm
about a half a dozen times.

345
00:51:00,215 --> 00:51:01,798
It's become a ritual.

346
00:51:05,658 --> 00:51:06,313
What?

347
00:51:10,238 --> 00:51:13,124
Promise me you'll talk to Hall
about his hair today.

348
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:20,121
I gotta go.

349
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:57,069
We can't pitch this,
we can't present this.

350
00:52:15,726 --> 00:52:17,617
We work very hard on this.

351
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:20,437
And I'll like to think we've
accomplished something.

352
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:23,455
Don't you feel like we've
accomplished something?

353
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:26,702
No, I don't.

354
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,291
Neither do I.

355
00:52:33,285 --> 00:52:35,866
We're living in the shadow
of a freaking snooze alarm

356
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:39,191
Where do you go from there?

357
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:47,681
What?

358
00:55:53,898 --> 00:55:55,289
How are you now?

359
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:57,342
Fine

360
00:55:58,641 --> 00:56:01,288
Don't you ever come again,
epidemic illness

361
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:05,468
No

362
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,055
You don't have to

363
00:56:15,593 --> 00:56:17,244
That person is gone

364
00:56:17,782 --> 00:56:18,868
Look at my face

365
00:56:19,939 --> 00:56:21,759
Can't wear it anymore

366
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:24,840
No

367
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,187
You will be fine

368
00:56:33,472 --> 00:56:36,254
Do you want to try?
- No

369
00:56:38,515 --> 00:56:40,596
I believes you've done it well

370
00:56:42,496 --> 00:56:44,747
Do you remember

371
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:47,494
The first time we met?

372
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:50,322
Yes

373
00:56:53,642 --> 00:56:55,293
Do you remember my hand?

374
00:56:57,557 --> 00:56:58,710
Yes

375
00:57:05,584 --> 00:57:07,707
Where is block 1 first floor?

376
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:09,764
To the left
- Here?

377
00:57:09,764 --> 00:57:11,087
Yes
- Thank you

378
00:57:17,228 --> 00:57:18,189
Who is it?

379
00:57:20,677 --> 00:57:23,890
Is Miss Hua here?
- Who is looking for her?

380
00:57:24,293 --> 00:57:28,071
I'm Master Jin's worker,
he asked me to come

381
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:25,094
Mr Zhao, wanna go?
- Yes

382
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:32,652
Miss, Master's Jin worker is here

383
00:58:34,354 --> 00:58:35,575
Let him ini

384
00:58:38,169 --> 00:58:40,782
You can come in

385
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,129
You can come in

386
00:58:54,457 --> 00:58:56,413
Miss Hua

387
00:58:57,343 --> 00:59:00,261
You're Master Jin's worker?
- Yes

388
00:59:00,394 --> 00:59:01,785
Name?

389
00:59:02,617 --> 00:59:04,200
Xiaozhang

390
00:59:07,062 --> 00:59:08,249
What's the matter?

391
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,332
Nothing

392
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:14,986
Stand nicely

393
00:59:24,047 --> 00:59:25,766
Put down your arms

394
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:36,678
What happened to you?

395
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:40,925
Nothing

396
00:59:43,817 --> 00:59:45,004
Take off your pants!

397
00:59:47,798 --> 00:59:48,657
Take it out!

398
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:53,729
Do you want me to call your Master?

399
00:59:57,086 --> 00:59:58,048
Take it out!

400
01:00:17,003 --> 01:00:18,223
Underwear too

401
01:00:34,872 --> 01:00:36,590
Nothing?

402
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,337
Come here

403
01:00:45,116 --> 01:00:46,438
Give me your hand

404
01:01:05,471 --> 01:01:07,788
Have you touched a woman before?

405
01:01:13,925 --> 01:01:16,705
No, how can you become a tailor?

406
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,875
You'll touch many women

407
01:01:23,738 --> 01:01:25,456
It becomes like this when you touched

408
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,500
Who wants to find you?

409
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,875
Am I good to you?

410
01:01:43,331 --> 01:01:44,257
All right

411
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,609
You remembered

412
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:50,349
Your master is old

413
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,064
He said you will be successful

414
01:01:56,094 --> 01:02:00,232
Maybe you'll become
a tailor after this

415
01:02:05,509 --> 01:02:07,860
You have to remember
your feeling today

416
01:02:09,256 --> 01:02:12,466
The dress made by you
is gonna be very beautiful

417
01:03:29,915 --> 01:03:31,101
Miss Hua

418
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:32,659
We have yet to congratulate you

419
01:03:33,859 --> 01:03:35,679
Some said you are married

420
01:03:36,644 --> 01:03:39,855
How come we don't know
such wonderful news?

421
01:03:42,844 --> 01:03:45,590
Xiaozhang? He went out

422
01:03:46,391 --> 01:03:49,827
Yes, the festival is near

423
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:51,857
A bit busy nowadays

424
01:03:53,154 --> 01:03:55,200
Why do you say such things?

425
01:03:55,474 --> 01:03:58,254
You know Xiaozhang

426
01:03:58,425 --> 01:04:00,143
He won't served other customers

427
01:04:00,414 --> 01:04:02,302
He only makes your dress

428
01:04:03,995 --> 01:04:07,635
All right, when Xiaozhang is back,
I asked him to come to your house

429
01:04:08,968 --> 01:04:10,856
All right

430
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,332
Didn't I say not to come again?

431
01:04:14,968 --> 01:04:17,613
If they see, what will happened?
You take care of me?

432
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,242
I take care of you

433
01:04:20,571 --> 01:04:22,119
What can you do?

434
01:04:22,361 --> 01:04:24,317
What do I eat later on?

435
01:04:24,715 --> 01:04:26,071
Eat me

436
01:04:26,506 --> 01:04:28,393
Irritating

437
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:42,245
Forget it

438
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:45,724
Don't be like that

439
01:04:54,088 --> 01:04:58,225
Next time, you go back first,
I called you, ok?

440
01:05:03,868 --> 01:05:05,653
I go back first
- Just go

441
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:17,117
Mr Zhao, are you going?
- There are things to do

442
01:05:17,692 --> 01:05:18,710
Goodbye

443
01:05:24,555 --> 01:05:27,505
Ying, if Mr Zhao come again,
tell him I'm not at home

444
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:28,695
Yes

445
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:33,298
Has Xiozhang came?
- Not yet

446
01:05:33,605 --> 01:05:35,493
Call him, ask him to come quickly

447
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:39,498
What Adonis?

448
01:05:40,699 --> 01:05:41,784
Him?

449
01:05:42,257 --> 01:05:44,009
He is my cousin brother

450
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:47,154
You always hear rumours

451
01:05:50,943 --> 01:05:53,723
Looks like Adonis
- Waiting for you

452
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:57,406
His hair is less than you

453
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:04,428
I have choosen the house

454
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:08,107
When you come tonight,
bring the cheque along

455
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,760
I want to give deposit

456
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:15,006
What?
- Miss Kofi

457
01:06:15,543 --> 01:06:17,656
Has Xiaozhang came?
Yes

458
01:06:18,162 --> 01:06:21,666
Give him this clothes, tell him Boss Chu
bought for me this clothes from France

459
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,288
Let him do it carefully

460
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,405
Give him a few dumplings, say
I'm the one who give him to eat

461
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:28,992
All right

462
01:06:29,566 --> 01:06:30,390
Hello?

463
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:32,310
What did you say?

464
01:06:33,279 --> 01:06:35,528
What do you scare?

465
01:06:36,295 --> 01:06:38,081
Scare of your wife?

466
01:06:38,947 --> 01:06:40,732
Scare of me?

467
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:43,455
Scare of me is all right

468
01:06:45,379 --> 01:06:47,335
Don't come tonight

469
01:06:47,965 --> 01:06:50,112
This dumplings is given by miss

470
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:51,935
She makes it herself

471
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:55,451
Thank you
- Okay

472
01:06:55,623 --> 01:06:57,873
Goodbye
- Goodbye

473
01:06:58,143 --> 01:06:59,069
See you again

474
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:26,815
Master Zhang, so early

475
01:07:27,051 --> 01:07:30,622
Have miss woke up?
- Miss is talking with Mr Zhao

476
01:07:30,731 --> 01:07:32,155
Any problem?

477
01:07:33,018 --> 01:07:35,798
The dress is ready,
I want to let her try

478
01:07:36,201 --> 01:07:37,591
Give it to me

479
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:40,409
Looks like they're
gonna discuss further

480
01:07:42,831 --> 01:07:43,792
All right

481
01:07:44,555 --> 01:07:47,539
If there's problem, call me

482
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:48,996
Okay
- I go first

483
01:07:52,545 --> 01:07:53,562
There's no need for you
to say like this

484
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:57,515
How many times must I say
we're relatives

485
01:07:57,683 --> 01:07:59,661
We don't have any relationship at all

486
01:08:04,015 --> 01:08:08,220
I know, you're boring, right?

487
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:13,424
Wanna dumped me just like that?
It's not that easy

488
01:08:14,293 --> 01:08:15,411
You listen carefully

489
01:08:16,945 --> 01:08:19,623
If you don't do things that satisfy me

490
01:08:21,188 --> 01:08:22,940
I won't let you go

491
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:31,927
Miss, Master Zhang
is waiting for you outside

492
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:40,312
How dare for him to come

493
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:46,077
I don't want.
I won't sew at there again

494
01:08:47,776 --> 01:08:49,923
Xiaozhang has gone out,
who is talking?

495
01:08:51,821 --> 01:08:53,143
Sis Ying, how are you?

496
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,355
I am Jin, he has gone out

497
01:08:57,523 --> 01:09:00,405
What? Miss is looking for him?

498
01:09:01,468 --> 01:09:03,582
If he comes back,
I ask him to go at once

499
01:09:05,248 --> 01:09:08,593
You're welcome, okay

500
01:09:15,326 --> 01:09:17,439
Hello Mr Shao?

501
01:09:19,436 --> 01:09:20,419
Me

502
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:23,006
You can't recognise my voice?

503
01:09:26,464 --> 01:09:28,317
Terrible

504
01:09:30,311 --> 01:09:31,734
You didn't go out?

505
01:09:34,686 --> 01:09:35,669
I am okay

506
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:43,234
Call you, nothing

507
01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:46,645
These 2 days

508
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:48,865
I miss you

509
01:09:51,527 --> 01:09:52,352
Who?

510
01:09:54,312 --> 01:09:55,498
Him?

511
01:09:56,765 --> 01:09:58,382
I didn't see him

512
01:10:00,313 --> 01:10:01,930
I didn't see him for some time

513
01:10:04,855 --> 01:10:06,708
Mr Shao

514
01:10:07,705 --> 01:10:10,520
I want to work

515
01:10:12,911 --> 01:10:14,889
Being at home is quite boring

516
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,854
Nothing to do

517
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:20,795
Mr Shao

518
01:10:21,265 --> 01:10:22,915
When I am performing

519
01:10:23,188 --> 01:10:25,076
You have to come and watch

520
01:10:27,033 --> 01:10:28,322
You promised to come?

521
01:10:32,338 --> 01:10:33,524
Yes

522
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,068
Are you

523
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:44,696
Busy later on?

524
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:51,588
I treat you to eat supper

525
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,108
Where?

526
01:10:57,964 --> 01:10:58,925
Okay

527
01:11:01,346 --> 01:11:03,392
So, you must come

528
01:11:04,462 --> 01:11:05,648
Okay

529
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:10,984
See you later

530
01:11:19,878 --> 01:11:21,234
Is it tight enough?

531
01:11:33,537 --> 01:11:34,791
Am I fat?

532
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,540
A little

533
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,457
You're usually 23 inches

534
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:41,987
Now

535
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,608
24 inches, 2 inches more

536
01:11:54,422 --> 01:11:55,711
Do like previously

537
01:11:56,908 --> 01:11:59,089
I want to go to work

538
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,410
Will be thin

539
01:12:03,538 --> 01:12:06,183
Don't you misunderstand

540
01:12:06,357 --> 01:12:08,742
I don't want to force you

541
01:12:09,108 --> 01:12:10,465
I heard that you're sick

542
01:12:10,733 --> 01:12:12,812
I called to ask how are you

543
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,333
Yes

544
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:20,901
You're our old customer

545
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,062
Okay

546
01:12:23,761 --> 01:12:27,640
You rest,
when you have time

547
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,198
I asked Xiaozhang to come
and collect it

548
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:31,210
Okay

549
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:34,232
See you again

550
01:12:38,084 --> 01:12:40,570
Who do you think you're?

551
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,457
You're just a hooker

552
01:12:43,355 --> 01:12:45,502
You're just like last time?
Without money

553
01:12:45,808 --> 01:12:47,130
No need to say anything

554
01:13:46,144 --> 01:13:48,755
You are back
- Yes

555
01:13:50,156 --> 01:13:51,117
What did he say?

556
01:13:53,338 --> 01:13:55,791
He is sick, ask me
to find him after a few days

557
01:13:56,422 --> 01:13:59,202
It's more than half a year

558
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,725
He can't take it anymore

559
01:14:02,057 --> 01:14:04,668
She didn't go to work

560
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:07,983
Everyday live in luxury

561
01:14:08,124 --> 01:14:09,672
Her lifestyle is luxurious

562
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,268
Force her after 2 days

563
01:14:12,268 --> 01:14:14,347
The festival is here soon

564
01:14:47,177 --> 01:14:49,132
Look at all these clothes

565
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,814
All needs to be changed

566
01:14:53,045 --> 01:14:54,469
Just sell it

567
01:14:55,929 --> 01:14:57,410
You keep the money

568
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,959
I still owe you

569
01:15:10,748 --> 01:15:11,641
Nevermind

570
01:15:12,705 --> 01:15:13,631
Nothing

571
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:24,205
You keep all these clothes

572
01:15:26,264 --> 01:15:27,450
A lot are still new

573
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:35,601
I can't wear that many,
I want to go other places

574
01:15:36,342 --> 01:15:38,026
I don't want to bring so many things

575
01:15:39,558 --> 01:15:41,446
Keeping it is not useful

576
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:44,858
Just bring it along

577
01:15:46,188 --> 01:15:47,578
Where are you going

578
01:16:03,195 --> 01:16:05,207
Can't bring so many clothes

579
01:16:08,234 --> 01:16:10,246
I haven't thanked you

580
01:16:13,306 --> 01:16:14,232
Take it

581
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:23,642
I know you like alcoholic drink

582
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,608
Come

583
01:16:35,253 --> 01:16:36,271
Drink

584
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:29,850
Who are you looking for?

585
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:33,061
Is Miss Hua here?

586
01:17:33,402 --> 01:17:35,018
She have moves out

587
01:17:35,954 --> 01:17:37,435
Do you know where she moves to?

588
01:17:37,943 --> 01:17:41,221
No
- Thank you

589
01:17:42,485 --> 01:17:43,807
Who?
Look for who?

590
01:17:43,943 --> 01:17:46,452
Miss Hua, she have moved

591
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,254
Hello?

592
01:18:55,254 --> 01:18:56,677
Yes

593
01:18:58,039 --> 01:18:59,090
Xiaozhang?

594
01:18:59,464 --> 01:19:00,425
He have went out

595
01:19:01,354 --> 01:19:02,574
Who is looking for him?

596
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:06,989
Miss Hua

597
01:19:07,156 --> 01:19:08,546
You

598
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,283
Yes, I am Master Jin

599
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:18,192
Sorry, I can't recognise your voice

600
01:19:19,024 --> 01:19:20,912
It's been a while since
we keep in touch

601
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:23,622
We miss you so much

602
01:19:27,047 --> 01:19:29,963
You're back, where do you live now?

603
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:36,949
Can you leave your contact number?

604
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:41,564
Okay

605
01:19:42,529 --> 01:19:45,998
When Xiaozhang is back,
I ask him to go at once

606
01:19:47,998 --> 01:19:49,976
Okay

607
01:19:51,115 --> 01:19:51,973
See you

608
01:19:54,297 --> 01:19:56,682
Where is Miss Hua's room?

609
01:19:57,314 --> 01:19:59,099
The room at the end uptairs

610
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,253
Thank you

611
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:27,844
Drink tea

612
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,128
So long no see

613
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:33,813
You're just like last time,
didn't change

614
01:20:36,268 --> 01:20:37,420
You too

615
01:20:38,356 --> 01:20:39,248
Thank you

616
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:46,238
You're getting better

617
01:20:49,893 --> 01:20:52,278
How are you?

618
01:20:53,142 --> 01:20:55,686
Have you married?
- Not yet

619
01:20:57,617 --> 01:20:58,543
Why?

620
01:21:00,502 --> 01:21:02,853
No one wants to marry me

621
01:21:05,276 --> 01:21:07,288
You introduce one to me

622
01:21:15,586 --> 01:21:17,010
Introduce myself

623
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:19,856
You won't mind, is it?

624
01:21:23,377 --> 01:21:24,495
No

625
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:27,017
Promise?

626
01:21:31,698 --> 01:21:32,749
Yes

627
01:21:36,836 --> 01:21:38,792
You're good to me

628
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:45,348
Can you...

629
01:21:47,114 --> 01:21:48,798
Sew a dress for me?

630
01:21:50,462 --> 01:21:51,581
What type of dress?

631
01:21:52,352 --> 01:21:53,369
Tell me

632
01:21:56,065 --> 01:21:57,285
A beautiful dress

633
01:21:59,413 --> 01:22:02,849
I have an old customer who
came back from America

634
01:22:03,424 --> 01:22:06,069
He still remembers me, ask me out

635
01:22:06,972 --> 01:22:11,076
I think this is my last chance

636
01:22:13,337 --> 01:22:15,021
Help me

637
01:22:16,918 --> 01:22:17,776
Okay

638
01:22:24,575 --> 01:22:27,525
This is the money I've left,
you take it first

639
01:22:29,515 --> 01:22:32,398
If I have extra, I'll pay again

640
01:22:34,355 --> 01:22:35,835
You keep it first

641
01:22:37,073 --> 01:22:38,995
I still keep your dress

642
01:22:41,052 --> 01:22:44,431
There's more new one.
Just change a bit

643
01:22:46,456 --> 01:22:48,807
Don't use use anymore money

644
01:22:51,495 --> 01:22:53,281
You still keep it

645
01:22:59,717 --> 01:23:03,028
I can't wear all those clothes

646
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,140
I have become thin

647
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,210
Want to measure for me again?

648
01:23:12,978 --> 01:23:13,904
There's no need

649
01:23:15,563 --> 01:23:17,214
I am used to your body

650
01:23:20,006 --> 01:23:22,186
Measure with your hand is enough

651
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:52,761
Do you know where Miss Hua went?
- You try to find her at the beach

652
01:25:53,168 --> 01:25:55,146
She is usually there at this time

653
01:25:55,522 --> 01:25:56,075
What is she doing over there?

654
01:25:56,218 --> 01:25:59,326
To work, what else?

655
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,983
It is raining heavily outside

656
01:28:15,258 --> 01:28:16,840
Is it enough?

657
01:28:19,799 --> 01:28:21,381
Who is she to you?

658
01:28:23,314 --> 01:28:24,500
We are friend

659
01:28:25,635 --> 01:28:28,641
Friend? Your friend is good

660
01:28:28,949 --> 01:28:30,531
Pay rent for her

661
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:34,081
She is very ill, if you've time,
bring her to see doctor

662
01:28:41,813 --> 01:28:45,419
How are you now?
- All right

663
01:28:45,757 --> 01:28:48,209
Don't you come again,
epidemic illness

664
01:28:52,156 --> 01:28:53,342
No

665
01:28:56,333 --> 01:28:58,345
I've altered your dress

666
01:29:01,074 --> 01:29:02,294
There's no need

667
01:29:03,195 --> 01:29:04,812
That person have gone

668
01:29:05,516 --> 01:29:09,551
Can't wear it anymore

669
01:29:11,881 --> 01:29:13,000
No

670
01:29:16,058 --> 01:29:17,414
You will be fine

671
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:22,953
Do you want to try?

672
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:24,742
No

673
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:28,516
I believe you did it very well

674
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,965
Do you remember

675
01:29:33,397 --> 01:29:35,680
The first time we met?

676
01:29:38,104 --> 01:29:39,087
Yes

677
01:29:42,249 --> 01:29:44,633
Do you remember my hand?

678
01:29:45,862 --> 01:29:46,981
Yes

679
01:29:49,608 --> 01:29:51,959
Do you hate me that day?

680
01:29:55,012 --> 01:29:56,436
No

681
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:02,170
I have to thanked you

682
01:30:03,234 --> 01:30:07,111
If not because of your hand,
I've change my job

683
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,153
Forget about me

684
01:30:12,748 --> 01:30:14,861
Find other girls

685
01:30:17,456 --> 01:30:18,778
Come here

686
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:31,740
You're good to me

687
01:30:32,175 --> 01:30:34,187
I can't repay you back

688
01:30:35,424 --> 01:30:38,069
I don't think there's chance

689
01:30:41,325 --> 01:30:43,371
I am fine

690
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,919
I still have something last time

691
01:30:48,917 --> 01:30:50,273
Now nothing

692
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,204
Only this hand that is left

693
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:07,977
Do you mind?

694
01:33:27,252 --> 01:33:29,795
Where do you go?
I want to find you

695
01:33:30,202 --> 01:33:31,920

696
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,299
She past away?

697
01:33:36,169 --> 01:33:36,756
Yes

698
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:40,040
So quick

699
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:42,198
Yes

700
01:33:44,557 --> 01:33:47,733
Today, there're many people
on the street sending her

701
01:33:49,497 --> 01:33:50,819
She is very happy

702
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:53,838
Dan beautiful too

703
01:33:58,647 --> 01:34:00,794
2 years ago, I thought she is gone

704
01:34:00,967 --> 01:34:03,611
Now there's chance she is back again

705
01:34:05,443 --> 01:34:07,160
Unimaginable

706
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:10,051
Yes

707
01:34:10,051 --> 01:34:11,972
Couldn't imagine it

708
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,250
Have Liu's dress finish?

709
01:34:26,991 --> 01:34:28,245
What happened to you?

710
01:37:13,713 --> 01:37:14,966
The End
