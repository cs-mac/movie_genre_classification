00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,124
How are you feeling?

969
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,651
Like shit.

970
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,242
I apologize for my colleague.

971
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,722
He is enthusiastic,
but perhaps not

972
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,485
as understanding
of the intellectual nuances.

973
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,601
Your father was imprisoned
at one time, was he not?

974
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,721
Yes.

975
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,325
When was this?

976
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,521
In 1953.

977
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,840
He was accused
of being a communist.

978
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,884
Yes. Was he?

979
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,207
He was a communist back then.

980
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,481
On whose authority
was he detained?

981
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,131
MAZIAR: Under the Shah.

982
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,645
Yes.

983
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,971
The Shah of Iran.

984
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,205
I'm sorry.

985
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,726
That must have been difficult
for your family.

986
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,570
Thank you, sir.

987
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,209
But I thought at that time,

988
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,284
Iran had a democratic leader.

989
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,207
Mossadegh. Mohammad Mossadegh.

990
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,209
So there was a coup?

991
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,362
Yes. Organized by?

992
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,283
The CIA. The
Americans, British...

993
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,362
Operation Ajax I believe
it was called.

994
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,204
The West wanted
the Iranian people's oil.

995
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,281
Yes.

996
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,011
And the journalists
and gangsters

997
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,448
that were paid by the CIA
to spread lies and violence,

998
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,569
and turn the Iranian people
against its government

999
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,564
so the Americans
and Zionists could deploy

1000
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,402
their puppet the traitor,
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi...

1001
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,528
Yes, but that was in those

This is not paranoia!

with these saboteurs

1007

to the unrest?

They... They are

They are friends of mine.

They are not saboteurs.

and I wanted to know
your opinion about, uh,

how the Americans do
espionage these days.

1029
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,721
Is it very different from how it
used to be in the '50s?

Is it?
