1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,207
My name is Johnny Barrett.

2
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:30,207
I'm a reporter on the Daiy Globe.

3
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:32,707
This is my story...

4
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:34,458
as far as it went.

5
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:51,595
When was the first time
you got this urge, Mr. Barrett?

6
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:55,471
- There must have been a first time.
- When I was 14.

7
00:01:57,139 --> 00:02:00,346
And when I was much younger -

8
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,096
10 -

9
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:03,722
that's when I got the feeling.

10
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:05,305
What gave it to you?

11
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,222
Her braids.

12
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:09,722
Tell me about her braids.

13
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:12,015
- I got excited.
- Go on.

14
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,348
I grabbed her braids.

15
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,223
Is that when you hurt her?

16
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:18,391
I never hurt her.

17
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:20,641
Did you pull on her braids?

18
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:23,725
I caressed them.

19
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,767
- Just -
- Did you pull on them?

20
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,559
Do you think I'm a fetishist?

21
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:30,267
Hell, no, Johnny!

22
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:33,143
- Let them bring up that word - Not you.
- Yeah.

23
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:37,185
You'll be facing the 
best psychiatrists in the state.

24
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,352
They'll know when you're shamming.

25
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:41,394
I feel sorry for Doc Fong.

26
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,935
Professionally he knows
he's playing with dynamite.

27
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:47,312
But he just couldn't turn down
his closest friend, Swanee.

28
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:51,228
They were in psychological 
warfare back in World War II.

29
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:55,563
Today, the doc's a topflight head-candler,
and Swanee's my boss...

30
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:57,897
managing editor of the Daiy Globe.

31
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:02,397
The role you'll be playing will be stronger
than your strongest imagination...

32
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,190
so don't ever weaken.

33
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:08,815
It'll be a daily duel between the 
insane and your own sane mind.

34
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,398
And as for the doctors there...

35
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:13,983
lower your mast for an instant
and they'll know you're a phony.

36
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,983
Never let them forget you're 
living on a sexual powder keg.

37
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:19,400
He's all yours, Swanee.

38
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:22,108
- Think he's ready?
- As he ever will be.

39
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,901
Well -

40
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:28,235
the next move is yours, Cathy.

41
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,611
Caressing my braids.

42
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,194
Kissing them.

43
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,236
What a disgusting story.

44
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:38,987
What happens if they find out
I'm not really his sister?

45
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:40,570
I'll handle that.

46
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:45,072
Johnny -

47
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:48,946
Johnny, you've got to be crazy to want to be
committed to an insane asylum to solve a murder.

48
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:52,072
Even if I don't crack this case, 
honey, my experiences alone...

49
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:54,572
- will make a book, a play or even a movie sale.
- But -

50
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:56,823
Every man wants to get
to the top of his profession.

51
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:58,615
- Mine is winning the Pulitzer Prize.
- Johnny -

52
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:03,865
- If this story doesn't do it, nothing ever will.
- But their sickness is bound to rub off on you.

53
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,366
I said the same thing to you
when you started singing in your skin.

54
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,908
- Remember, Cathy?
- That's different.

55
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:12,534
But those hookers didn't get to you, did they?
And those lunatics are not gonna get to me.

56
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,659
He's right.

57
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:18,743
Reporters have impersonated coal miners,
school teachers, hoodlums.

58
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:20,743
Those reporters went in for a purpose.

59
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,078
Not to win a journalistic halo
on the cover of Life.

60
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,161
And not to win a cash prize and get
their pictures in Time and Newsweek.

61
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,036
Oh, come on, Cathy.
All you have to do is play your part.

62
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:31,079
I'm fed up.

63
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:34,287
Fed up playing Greek chorus
to your rehearsed nightmare.

64
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:37,454
Why don't you smuggle aboard a rocket
and write the memoirs of an astronaut?

65
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:40,997
- You have any cigarettes, Cathy?
- Why don't you give up this psychoanalytical binge?

66
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:43,039
Because it's what people buy.

67
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:46,955
Mark Twain didn't psychoanalyze
Huck Finn or Tom Sawyer.

68
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,581
Dickens didn't put Oliver Twist 
on the couch because he was hungry.

69
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,915
- Oh, come on, Cathy.
- Good copy comes out of people, Johnny...

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,917
not out of a lot of explanatory medical terms.

71
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,542
Oh, stop it, will you?

72
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:59,754
You're on a hopped up, show-off stage.
Get off it.

73
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:02,506
Don't be Moses leading your 
lunatics to the Pulitzer Prize.

74
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,674
- Would you care for a cigarette?
- You make me sick!

75
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:10,427
Sick at the thought of you playing games
with your mind and riding that crazy horse.

76
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:14,098
He has been conditioned
for a whole year to ride that horse.

77
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:17,517
You've got to saddle it and 
get me off and running, that's all, Cathy.

78
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:21,143
Scratch me in this race, Johnny.

79
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,192
We made a deal.

80
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:37,364
My whole instinct is to kick myself hard
for ever having gone into this deal with you.

81
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,243
What I should do is to land a righteous 
punch in your supercivilized nose.

82
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:44,119
Oh, Cathy, you're an intellectual,
well past the age -

83
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:46,411
Don't you dare analyze me!

84
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:50,665
Johnny?

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,333
Johnny.

86
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:58,295
Johnny, I'm in love with a normal 
reporter holding down a normal job.

87
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,629
Mm-hmm, normal.

88
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:03,465
Do you think I like singing in that 
sewer with a hot light on my navel?

89
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:06,927
I'm doing it because it pays more
than shorthand or clerking or typing.

90
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:10,304
- I know that, Cathy.
- I'm saving money so we can have that normal life.

91
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:12,889
- That's all I want.
- I know all about that.

92
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:14,473
But I'm scared.

93
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:18,144
I'm scared when I see how 
calm Dr. Fong and Swanee...

94
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:20,436
and you can be about
this whole crazy scheme of yours.

95
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:22,062
Oh.

96
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:26,816
I'm scared this whole Jekyll-Hyde idea's
going to make a psycho out of me.

97
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:28,901
Oh, now, wait a minute, Cathy.

98
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:30,068
Cathy.

99
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:34,113
Do you think I'd ever
let anything happen to you?

100
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,116
But you've just gotta go through
with your part, honey.

101
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:40,493
You're the only one we can trust.

102
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:47,539
Thank God.

103
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,208
Cathy. Cathy.

104
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:52,877
Then go back to your dive!

105
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:56,171
Dive?

106
00:06:56,256 --> 00:07:00,340
That dive is holy compared
to your ideas of work.

107
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:03,759
Hamlet was made for Freud, not you.

110
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:37,075
I want--

111
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,037
Somebody

112
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:45,956
- To love.
- Johnny, Johnny--

113
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:50,084
Someone to care--

114
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:54,546
- For me.
- Johnny, Johnny--

115
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:56,881
Johnny, Johnny--

116
00:07:56,966 --> 00:08:01,468
I need--

117
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:08,724
Somebody to hold

118
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:12,559
Someone who'll hold

119
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:17,980
Just me.

120
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:22,399
I'd like someone--

121
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:28,571
Who'll always be tender and sweet

122
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:34,116
And kind

123
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:42,289
Who's mine

124
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:47,209
All mine

125
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:54,756
I need

126
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:59,969
Somebody to kiss

127
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:03,263
Someone who'll kiss

128
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:08,100
Just me

129
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:14,187
I want somebody to miss

130
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:18,107
Someone who'll miss

131
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:27,029
Just me

132
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:31,200
I know

133
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,953
That somewhere

134
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:39,831
There's a someone

135
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:47,628
Who's true

136
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,841
I know

137
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:59,470
- The lover I want
- Johnny, Johnny

138
00:10:00,222 --> 00:10:05,975
Darlin', my love

139
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:15,106
Is you

141
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:22,987
Well, I told Mr. Ford that the 
only way for a stripper to strip...

142
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,990
is for me to take off all my clothes.

143
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:33,578
- Did Johnny phone?
- No.

145
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:51,007
Scared this whole Jekyll-Hyde idea...

146
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,843
is going to backfire
and make a psycho out of me.

147
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:03,767
But their sickness is bound
to rub off on you.

148
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,188
I said the same thing to you when 
you started singing in your skin.

149
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:10,396
- Remember, Cathy?
- That's different.

150
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:14,733
But those hookers didn't get to you, did they?
And those lunatics are not gonna get to me.

151
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:19,153
She's gonna blow her top
if that guy dumped her.

152
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:24,157
How can a girl love a guy that much?

153
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,700
Tell him it's Cathy.

154
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,035
Yeah?

155
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,663
Put her on.

156
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:35,915
Oh, Swanee.

157
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,523
Change your mind, Cathy?

158
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:40,407
Swanee, it's been4 days.

159
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,931
You called the shot.

160
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:46,916
Swanee, I haven't heard 
from him in 4 days.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,546
If you love him,
you'd go the limit for him.

162
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,573
Well, good evening.
What can I do for you, young lady?

163
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,873
My brother won't let me alone. He -

164
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:10,512
How old is he?

165
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,640
30.

166
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:14,816
- Are you married?
- No.

167
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,116
Does he live with you?

168
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,201
No.

169
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,128
Has he ever tried to... attack you?

170
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:25,467
He's tried.

171
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:27,973
Has he ever hurt you?

172
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:30,731
Yes.

173
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:34,029
Have you ever brought charges
against his sickness?

174
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:38,040
- Why not?
- Ashamed.

175
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,337
And now?

176
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,977
He said he'd...

177
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:47,565
kill me if I -

178
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:53,914
Are you ready to sign a formal complaint
that he's mentally unsound?

179
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:58,300
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes.

180
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:00,389
What's your brother's full name, please?

181
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:02,645
John Barrett.

183
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,083
County General Hospital.

184
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,965
The psycho unit, please.

185
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,511
Dr. Menkin?

186
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,100
Kane, 16th precinct.

187
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:21,484
Subject's name:
John Barrett.

188
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:24,283
Attempted incest with sister.

189
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:29,212
Soon as we pick him up we'll send 
him over for emergency admission.

190
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,721
How dare you jackass me
down here on her say-so!

191
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:35,645
I'm a reporter for the Daily Glofbe!
Call my boss. He'll vouch for me.

192
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,109
We checked with him.
He gave you a clean bill of health.

193
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:40,407
- That's more like it.
- But his word doesn't carry much weight...

194
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:43,039
- since your sister signed a formal complaint -
- Formal complaint?

195
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:47,133
Now what can you expect from a stripper?
Sis, come in here and explain how
you dreamed this whole thing up.

196
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,803
Please. Mr. Barrett, please.

197
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:50,390
Sit down.

198
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:53,775
Please?

199
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,352
- Your father living?
- No.

200
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:04,219
- Did you like him?
- Of course.

201
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,656
- Any brothers?
- No.

202
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:13,800
- Any other sisters?
- Just Cathy, and that's enough.

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
- Mother living?
- No.

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,632
You, uh -

205
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:22,205
- You love Cathy, don't you?
- She's my sister.

206
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:26,861
- You love her like a woman, don't you?
- I would never let a meathead have her, no.

207
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:30,047
Mothers and fathers have the same fears.

208
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:34,498
- You understand me, don't you?
- Of course. Of course.

209
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:40,461
Tell me, when was the first time
you felt differently toward your sister?

210
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,892
Well, there must have been a first time.

211
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,160
When I was 14.

212
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,234
Look at the way his eyes lit up.

213
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,217
He's got me talkin'.

214
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:55,789
He's a happy little rascal.

215
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,941
Maybe younger, when I was 10.

216
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:02,159
Now if you'd just ask me
what made me feel different...

217
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:04,774
this story will write itself!

218
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:07,768
What made you feel differently toward her?

219
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,131
Her braids.

220
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:12,451
Tell me about her braids.

221
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,898
I caressed them...

222
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:16,205
kissed them.

223
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,019
Did you pull on them?

224
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:19,410
I'd never hurt her.

225
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:25,358
The next question's gotta be about fetishist, 
according to Doc Fong's script.

226
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:28,985
Oh, I don't like this.
He's stalling too much.

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,921
If he doesn't come through with that question,
I'll fall right on my typographical face.

228
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:39,884
Do you know what a fetishist is?

229
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:42,011
There's no contest in this.

230
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:43,596
Sure, I know.

231
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:46,224
As a reporter, did you ever cover a story...

232
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:50,312
where a man became intensely excited
whenever he saw a woman with long hair...

233
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:52,648
long, loose hair?

234
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:53,732
Yes.

235
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,776
- Did he make love to her?
- Yes, he killed her.

236
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,821
You don't want to wake up some fine 
morning to learn you killed your sister.

237
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:01,241
Oh, now, Doctor, I'm no epileptic
with some kind of fetish for hair!

238
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:03,952
- Of course, Cathy - Now, her hair is different.
- I understand.

239
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:05,954
- I figured you would. Yes.
- I understand.

240
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:08,707
Didn't you threaten to commit suicide
if she ever got married?

241
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:12,335
Didn't you threaten your sister
if she wouldn't let you make love to her?

242
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:13,587
- That's different.
- Why?

243
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,214
- Because she's different.
- Why is she different?

244
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:16,465
- Because!
- Because why?

245
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,385
Because I want her,
and nobody's gonna keep her from me!

246
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:22,513
I want her, Doc!

248
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,146
Cathy! Cathy!

250
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,402
Cathy! Cathy!

252
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,702
Cathy! Cathy!

253
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:44,495
Cathy!

254
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,790
Cathy! Cathy!

255
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,293
Cathy! No!

256
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:57,342
Personality synthesis. 
Test emotional state.

257
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:03,057
Test 3: emotional tendencies.
Test 2: personality synthesis.

258
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:05,100
Emotional state.

259
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:12,067
You were a healthy lover,
until you started this crazy idea.

260
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:15,195
And now it's consumed you.

261
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,239
You made a nervous wreck out of me.

262
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,203
Well, reverse the situation, Johnny.

263
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:25,664
What if I -

264
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,878
I were going away on a trip
that could separate us for weeks...

265
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,880
or months?

266
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:35,508
Would you help me...

267
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:38,303
put a gap between us?

268
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:43,308
The drama critic on your paper...

269
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:48,063
said my "Chablis-tinted hair...

270
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:51,234
"is like a soft halo...

271
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:53,611
"over wide-set...

272
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,863
inviting eyes".

273
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,825
And my mouth -

274
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:01,994
my mouth was a lush tunnel...

275
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,457
through which golden notes came.

276
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,167
Stop it, Cathy.

277
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,226
And my movements...

278
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,314
evoke the most inflammatory passions...

279
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,770
in all -

280
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:33,765
I miss you, Cathy.

281
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,510
My yen for you goes up and down
like a fever chart.

282
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:45,165
- I love you, Cathy.
- I don't like being alone, Johnny.

283
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,449
But you made me be alone, Johnny.

284
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:54,153
And I have a right...

285
00:18:54,238 --> 00:18:56,483
to find another Johnny.

286
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:58,272
No!

287
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:03,140
Let me have his frequency table.

288
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:14,416
Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

289
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:20,408
Shows a culmination of
internal sexual conflict...

290
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:23,778
generally of old standing...

291
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:29,519
and based on a constitutionally 
determined chaotic sexual pattern.

292
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:31,059
There's no doubt.

293
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:33,015
"His pattern of symptoms...

294
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:36,676
"in a mental disease is familiar.

295
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:40,503
"We've got to resolve the underlying...

296
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:43,750
"sexual conflict.

297
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:47,411
"Whenever he wants his sister physically...

298
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:53,735
"he is taking the form
of a mental breakdown...

299
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,227
an acute schizophrenic episode".

300
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,678
Well, what does it mean?

301
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,297
Means I'm a pretty good teacher,
and Johnny's a smart student.

302
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:12,375
- So far, so good.
- I don't mean that.

303
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,869
Aren't either of you
concerned about his breakdown?

304
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:18,076
What breakdown?

305
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,531
Well, taking all those tests
is bound to make him sick.

306
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:22,986
You're right.
That is something to worry about.

307
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,730
On the contrary,
I think he's caught the perfect mood -

308
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:30,557
a borderline psychosis,
exactly as we rehearsed.

309
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:35,426
And if the superior court judge buys
his performance, he'll be committed.

310
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:41,667
140 I.Q. classification.
Very good, Mr. Barrett.

311
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:43,332
Means superior intelligence.

312
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,825
Oh, my name's Wilkes. I'm sorry.
You'll have to get used to no belt, no shoelaces.

313
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:50,821
New patient. John Barrett.

314
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:52,402
Barrett, eh?

315
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:56,438
Barrett, put it back.

316
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:01,805
Barrett -

317
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:04,053
Ward B, bed 2.

318
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:07,631
Come on, Mr. Barrett.

319
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:10,335
Come on.

320
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:13,914
Barrett, uh?

321
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:17,075
So you're a 140 I.Q. journalist.

322
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,486
- Where's your typewriter?
- Easy, Lloyd.

323
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:23,358
The last reporter I had on 
this floor was Ben Franklin.

324
00:21:23,443 --> 00:21:25,855
- And that egghead gave me more trouble than -
- Come on, Mr. Barrett.

325
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:28,101
Born phonies, all you newspapermen.

326
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,036
You came at the make-friends hour.

327
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:49,197
Patients who behave are permitted

00:21:49,282 --> 00:21:50,778
They call it "the street".

329
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:53,108
Gives 'em a chance to make new friends.

330
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,063
The women have their "street" too.

331
00:21:56,021 --> 00:22:00,098
I used to work in the female wing,
but the nympho ward got too dangerous for me.

332
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,998
Well, this one's yours, Mr. Barrett.

333
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:13,787
Am I the only loony in this ward?

334
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,198
No, Mr. Barrett.
Your roommates are in the street.

335
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:20,070
Oh, if you don't mind,
we never use words here like...

336
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:23,523
"nuts", "bugs", "screwy", "goofy", "loony".

337
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,770
We'd like it very much
if you didn't use them either.

338
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:28,890
I'm sorry.
I'm a greenhorn inmate.

339
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:32,385
- You're a patient, not an inmate.
- This is an insane asylum, is it not?

340
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:36,754
Not exactly. This is a mental hospital,
and we're dealing with mental hygiene.

341
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,333
After Dr. Cristo takes you in hand,
you'll be a different man.

342
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,337
He has one of the finest records
in the country.

343
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:52,480
- I really don't belong here.
- I understand.

344
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:54,610
You won't cause any trouble though, will you?

345
00:22:54,694 --> 00:22:57,866
As you did when you attacked
the county hospital psychiatrist.

346
00:22:57,951 --> 00:23:01,706
- I forgot myself.
- We're here to help you to remember not to forget.

347
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:05,464
- I phone my sister?
- No. I'm sorry.

348
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,135
I'm hungry!

349
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,431
Lloyd will show you your place
in the dining room.

350
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:11,561
- Lloyd?
- What's the matter?

351
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:14,232
Lloyd, the keeper that called me a phony?

352
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:17,281
Well, he's no keeper.
He is an attendant like me.

353
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:20,412
Lloyd doesn't like me.

354
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:25,339
Don't mind him. He doesn't mean 
anything with that chip on his shoulder.

355
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:29,096
It's just his way of fighting everybody
because he can't cure the patients.

356
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:32,855
Well, make yourself at home, Mr. Barrett.

357
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:38,700
I made it! I'm in!

358
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:47,927
Ever since my voice changed, I wanted to be
in the company of the newspaper greats.

359
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:53,939
And this long corridor is the magic highway...

360
00:23:54,024 --> 00:23:55,817
to the Pulitzer Prize.

361
00:23:58,324 --> 00:24:02,080
Maybe I'm looking at the killer right now.

362
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,136
Three witnesses -

363
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:12,352
Stuart, Trent, Boden.

364
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:25,044
- How do you do? I'm Pagliacci.
- Johnny Barrett.

365
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,922
Welcome to Ward B, Mr. Barrett.

366
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:37,193
If you expect a demonstration of insanity -

367
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,905
forget it.

368
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,957
What are you in here for, Mr. Barrett?

369
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:37,608
Witness number one: Stuart.

370
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,780
Farm boy from the Bible Belt.

371
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:42,452
Hobby: Playing Civil War games.

372
00:25:42,537 --> 00:25:46,544
Believes he's General Jeb Stuart,
Confederate hero of the Civil War.

374
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:10,300
Mr. Pulitzer.

375
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:13,390
Come on. I'll show you to your table.

376
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,713
This is your place from now on, Brisbane.

377
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:30,091
Yes, sir.

378
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:32,388
- Just behave yourself.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,142
Yes, sir.

380
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:47,961
They don't give us any knives or forks around here. 
They're afraid we'll hurt ourselves.

381
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,251
- Take your anti-convulsions.
- I don't like it.

382
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:32,468
Gimme, uh, the -
Gimme the, uh -

383
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:35,432
the tranquilizer drug.

384
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:39,190
No, no, no, no. 
Gimme - Gimme - Gimme -

385
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:41,696
Gimme the - the -
That one. That one.

386
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:45,328
No, no, no. No, th-that one - that one there.
The white one. Yeah.

387
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,920
I hate my meat already chewed up!
I can eat a steak the size of a cow!

388
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:52,342
- What am I, an infant?
- Drink this.

389
00:27:52,428 --> 00:27:54,347
He ate my vitamins!

391
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:06,413
Stuart.

392
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:12,091
He took my vitamins!
Gimme back my vitamins!

393
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:13,677
Gimme back my vitamins!

394
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:16,099
Stuart, bring your brigade up
around the right here.

395
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:19,773
We'll flank McClellan's forces.
Then we hit Antietam and hit 'em hard.

396
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:22,028
You will address me as "sir".

397
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:24,283
A lieutenant general never serves
a major general.

399
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,295
What lieutenant general?

400
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:32,800
Nathan Bedford Forrest.

402
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:37,685
At ease, General.
Report to my command post.

403
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,271
Where are you bivouacked, sir?

404
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:41,985
Come on, gentlemen.
We're going back to the wards.

405
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:44,991
Where are you bivouacked, sir?

406
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:47,872
A mile north of Gettysburg - Ward B.

407
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,795
Better leave your brigade
behind with me, General.

408
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,800
I'll be there, sir.

409
00:28:52,884 --> 00:28:55,096
Now march!

411
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:29,248
All the men want me, Johnny.

412
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,837
But I want you.

413
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:35,136
And you -

414
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,267
you want the Pulitzer Prize.

415
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:45,991
I--

416
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,997
Want--

417
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:53,756
Somebody

418
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:57,472
- To love
- Johnny, Johnny

419
00:29:57,557 --> 00:30:02,733
Someone to care

420
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:06,491
For me

421
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:13,798
I need

422
00:30:13,882 --> 00:30:18,891
Somebody

423
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:23,943
Somebody to hold

428
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:56,382
Figaro

433
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:34,376
Thank you.

434
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,800
I was in the middle of an aria.

435
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:40,556
And I pitched forward on my face like this...

436
00:32:43,354 --> 00:32:45,941
and died of a heart attack...

437
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:47,946
caused by overweight.

438
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,832
A knife is a messy weapon!

439
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:01,458
It was a knife that killed Sloan in the kitchen.

440
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:09,085
Do you know why so many 
people came to my funeral?

442
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,378
They wanted to make sure I was dead.

443
00:33:15,463 --> 00:33:18,712
Who used a knife on Sloan?

445
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:23,546
I took my time killing my wife.

446
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,256
Did you know that a man named Sloan,
a patient here, was killed with a knife in the kitchen?

447
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:33,756
Still an unsolved murder.

448
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:36,757
I despise butchery!

449
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,592
I didn't want my wife to die like Sloan...

450
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:44,717
so I gently sang her to death.

451
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:50,760
Good night, Mr. Barrett.

452
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:57,802
He remembered Sloan's murderer.

453
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:01,303
They do have flashes of sanity.

455
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:18,140
Breakfast bell! Wake up, John!
Wake up! Jonathan, up.

456
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:20,433
La, la, la, la
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

457
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,558
- Wake up, John. Wake up. Wake up.
- Good morning.

458
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:27,601
Now that's better.

459
00:34:35,145 --> 00:34:37,727
La, la, la, la

460
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:40,811
La, la, la, up

461
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:43,520
Sing.
Figaro ti, Figaro ta

462
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:45,062
Sing. Sing. Sing.

465
00:34:51,982 --> 00:34:54,398
Ah, you started as a copy boy, I see.

466
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,106
Yeah, when I was 14.

467
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:59,191
And supported your sister.

468
00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:02,191
Did you sleep well?

470
00:35:06,193 --> 00:35:08,275
I'm an opera lover now.

472
00:35:09,694 --> 00:35:11,485
Pagliacci's harmless.

473
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:17,027
I want to help you, John,
but I need your cooperation.

474
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:18,362
I understand.

475
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:20,695
Why didn't you cooperate
with my staff this morning?

476
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,236
They want to hurt me.

477
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:23,987
Do I want to hurt you?

478
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:31,696
Oh, I've had my eye on you
every minute since I've been here.

479
00:35:31,782 --> 00:35:33,864
- Do you know who I am?
- Of course.

480
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:35,739
Who am I?

481
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:41,074
Dr. Cristo, clinical director,
head of the medical staff for seven years.

482
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,699
Married, two children.
Hobby: Golf.

483
00:35:43,784 --> 00:35:45,783
Don't you know?

484
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:52,076
Now it's time to ask me about voices.

485
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:55,785
You hear voices?

486
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,119
Yes.

487
00:35:57,204 --> 00:36:00,161
My head hurts.
I gotta get outta here.

488
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:03,620
Call my paper. They can't go to press
without me there. Is Cathy all right?

489
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:05,371
That's why you're here, John...

490
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,371
to make sure she will be all right,
you understand?

491
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:11,538
Why did you fingerprint me?
I've committed no crime.

492
00:36:11,623 --> 00:36:13,372
You're not in prison, John.

493
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:16,206
He told me I shouldn't
love her as a woman.

494
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,748
Who told you?

495
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:21,207
The man on TV. He looked right at me 
and told me it was naughty.

496
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:23,750
Now, how would he know?
He's never met Cathy.

497
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:27,708
- Does he talk to you often?
- Every time I turn on TV.

498
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:30,209
Could this man be your father?

499
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:34,292
My father wouldn't get sore
if I played around with Cathy.

500
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:37,543
And besides, what's he doing on TV?
He's dead.

501
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:39,711
I am impotent.

502
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:41,878
And I like it.

504
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:48,754
- How you feeling, Mr. Barrett?
- Fine. Just fine.

505
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:52,213
Hydrotherapy -
is that what you call this treatment I'm getting?

506
00:36:52,298 --> 00:36:53,797
That's right.

507
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:56,798
- Cathy come to visit me yet?
- Your sister?

508
00:36:56,882 --> 00:37:00,256
- Yeah.
- Not yet. She'll probably come on visiting day.

509
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:04,549
- Confidentially, Mr. Wilkes -
- Yes?

510
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:06,716
Come here. Come here.

511
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:09,716
Do you really think that all this
nerve-calming treatment's...

512
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:12,884
gonna help me forget
how much I want her in my arms?

513
00:37:31,223 --> 00:37:34,597
We know about his fetish for your hair.

514
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:36,972
But did he ever try to cut it off?

515
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:41,557
Once.

516
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,599
With a pair of scissors or a knife?

517
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,225
Scissors.

518
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,767
Did he kiss you when he 
tried to cut off your hair?

519
00:37:53,852 --> 00:37:55,060
No.

520
00:37:57,478 --> 00:37:59,477
Well - Uh -

521
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:02,103
Yes.

522
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,646
Did he ever attack any man
who showed an interest in you?

523
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,938
Yes.

524
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:14,896
- Do you love John?
- Oh, yes.

525
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:17,897
More than just as a brother?

526
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:19,981
What do you mean?

527
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:23,856
Well, often these cases are 
developed through encouragement. 

528
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:26,482
What do you mean?

529
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:33,818
Forgive me for saying it, Ms. Barrett,
but there's something very strange about this case.

530
00:38:35,486 --> 00:38:37,777
And you don't appear to be too cooperative.

531
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:40,944
I -

532
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,653
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Dr. Cristo. I -

533
00:38:46,154 --> 00:38:49,904
When I received your call, I - I thought
something had happened to Johnny and I -

534
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,571
Well, I just wasn't prepared for this -

535
00:38:54,656 --> 00:38:56,154
- Inquisition?
- No.

536
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,155
But you thought of the word, didn't you?

537
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:01,155
Yes.

538
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:05,490
Was he jealous of the way you
revealed your body to other men?

540
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:17,159
Relax, Ms. Barrett.

541
00:39:22,995 --> 00:39:24,577
May I see Johnny now?

542
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,327
You'll have to wait for visiting day.

543
00:39:27,413 --> 00:39:28,911
How is he getting along?

544
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:32,496
- He's in dance therapy now.
- Dance therapy?

546
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:40,247
- I got an idea how I can help my buddy.
- I'd do anything to help.

547
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:42,289
All right.
Have the fellow play "Dixie".

548
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,080
Joe, would you please play "Dixie"?

551
00:40:40,113 --> 00:40:43,775
And a-1 and a-2

552
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,646
And a-3 and a-4

562
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,150
I want water!

563
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:14,288
I'll get the water for you, General.

564
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:18,152
Dixie!

565
00:41:18,237 --> 00:41:21,072
1, 2, 3 and 4.

568
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:28,267
Dixie!

569
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:32,091
4 and 5 and 6

571
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,988
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

572
00:41:40,072 --> 00:41:44,555
My Bonnie lies over the sea

573
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:48,669
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

574
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:53,111
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me

575
00:41:53,196 --> 00:41:57,226
Bring back, oh, bring back

576
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,282
Oh, bring back my Bonnie

577
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:00,435
Nymphos.

578
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:13,705
He's mine.

579
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,598
What's the matter with this door?

580
00:42:15,685 --> 00:42:25,411
He's mine.

581
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,952
Hello, girls.

582
00:42:33,288 --> 00:42:35,912
I hope that door opens.

583
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,680
It's got to!

584
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:04,245
My Bonnie lies over the sea

585
00:43:04,313 --> 00:43:07,741
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

586
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:10,836
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me

587
00:43:10,904 --> 00:43:14,064
My Bonnie lies over the sea

588
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,932
My Bonnie lies over

589
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,828
I love coffee, I love tea

590
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:22,184
I love the boys and the boys love me

591
00:43:22,241 --> 00:43:24,956
I love coffee, I love tea

593
00:43:26,066 --> 00:43:28,670
I love coffee, I love tea!
I love the boys, and the boys love me!

594
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,058
I heard about you getting 
wounded at Shiloh, sir.

595
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:04,554
Does it hurt much?

596
00:44:06,305 --> 00:44:09,522
I'll get the mess sergeant
to fix you some baked apple.

598
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,610
Baked apple. I -

599
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:20,570
I haven't had any baked apple
since I was in Japan.

600
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:23,431
How far is that from Shiloh?

601
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:27,325
Japan isn't in this country.

602
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:30,346
It's far away in Asia.

603
00:44:38,494 --> 00:44:40,718
Is that Buddha still there?

604
00:44:44,654 --> 00:44:46,798
I keep seeing it in color...

605
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,468
and it keeps looking at me.

606
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:50,693
The Great Buddha of Kamakura.

607
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:52,919
I want to climb a parallel up to his head...

608
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,322
and look at the people down below
praying for my battalion.

609
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,561
I keep seeing monks in a parade...

610
00:44:59,645 --> 00:45:03,382
and little girls dressed
like baby geishas...

611
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,294
going to prayer...

612
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:08,783
to ask Buddha to take care of me
when I go back to Korea.

613
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:12,022
I get up there on that playground.
It's on the roof of the world.

614
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:15,512
And the wheel keeps going
round and round...

615
00:45:15,596 --> 00:45:17,506
and round!

616
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,909
Like those Commies kept going
round and round us on that hill in Korea.

617
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:24,526
Toy train.

618
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:27,433
Toy train. No.

619
00:45:28,971 --> 00:45:29,966
Train.

620
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,999
Mount Fuji.

621
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:40,959
No. Another train.
And another train. And another.

622
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:44,461
And another! And another!
And another!

623
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:50,464
We were supposed to 
sandbag a train in Korea.

624
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,716
But we were captured.

625
00:45:56,635 --> 00:45:59,468
I remember it was cold,
and they marched us in the snow.

626
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:08,056
Who are you?

627
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,389
Johnny Barrett.

628
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:14,892
Well, what is this place?

629
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,309
It's a mental hospital.

630
00:46:18,394 --> 00:46:20,186
What am I doing here?

631
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,562
You were a Commie in Korea.

632
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:28,231
- That's a dirty lie!
- You became a member of the Kremlin Club.

633
00:46:28,316 --> 00:46:29,982
Don't you call me a Commie!

634
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:32,316
You wrote your father that 
the Russians were your friends.

635
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:35,235
Now you tell me something, boy.
Why should I write my Pappy?

636
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,235
He can't read.

637
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,570
He's a tenant farmer.
He can't read or write.

638
00:46:43,906 --> 00:46:45,405
I remember.

639
00:46:48,158 --> 00:46:51,659
I remember I helped Pappy 
sharecrop another man's land.

640
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,828
But that's before I ran away 
from home and joined the army.

641
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,163
But, now, why did I run away from home?

642
00:47:02,248 --> 00:47:04,247
I like my home.

643
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,999
That's a downright lie.

644
00:47:11,252 --> 00:47:12,876
Downright lie.

645
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:21,004
I know why I went over to the Commies.

646
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,757
Ever since I was a kid...

647
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,843
my folks fed me bigotry for breakfast
and ignorance for supper.

648
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:31,843
Never - not once -

649
00:47:31,928 --> 00:47:36,846
did they ever make me feel 
proud of where I was born.

650
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:40,430
Now, see, that was 
a cancer they put in me.

651
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:45,349
No knowledge of my country.

652
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:47,851
No pride.

653
00:47:49,353 --> 00:47:51,103
Just a hymn of hate.

654
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:56,521
I'd have defected to any enemy.

655
00:47:58,274 --> 00:48:02,691
Because, you see, it was easy.
My brains was cabbage.

656
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:06,359
They taught me everything
from cabbages to commissars.

657
00:48:06,443 --> 00:48:08,442
And they gave me a woman.

658
00:48:11,947 --> 00:48:14,280
And she called me "mister".

659
00:48:14,364 --> 00:48:16,446
And she made me feel important.

660
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:22,117
What changed your mind
about the Reds?

661
00:48:23,451 --> 00:48:29,036
The Dogface.

662
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:36,248
I was having a ball waving a red flag
until I met a sergeant from the First Division.

663
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,875
He was a G.I. retread from World War II.

664
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,669
Fought through North Africa and Sicily...

665
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:47,879
and all through Europe
up to Czechoslovakia.

666
00:48:50,548 --> 00:48:53,631
And after he was captured in Korea,
well, then he was transferred to my camp...

667
00:48:53,716 --> 00:48:55,631
and then...

668
00:48:55,717 --> 00:48:58,717
I was assigned to help brainwash 
him over to the Commie side.

669
00:49:04,305 --> 00:49:06,512
And this sergeant -

670
00:49:06,597 --> 00:49:08,804
Kolowicz.

671
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,306
That was his name.

672
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,140
Kolowicz.

673
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:17,809
He told me things that...

674
00:49:17,894 --> 00:49:19,809
I never dreamed of.

675
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:31,064
Things that - that I wanted to wrap up
gentle and proud-like and...

676
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,649
go to sleep thinking about.

677
00:49:34,902 --> 00:49:37,067
Things that give me a feeling like -

678
00:49:39,487 --> 00:49:41,737
Things my folks should have told me.

679
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:46,405
And I wanted to go home.

680
00:49:50,326 --> 00:49:53,576
So, yeah, I stopped wavin' the red flag.

681
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,911
And the Commies said
that I was sick in the head.

682
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:04,581
So it was easy for me to...
get on the next prisoner exchange.

683
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:10,417
And they brought me back and they 
gave me a dishonorable discharge.

684
00:50:11,085 --> 00:50:13,335
And nobody talked to me.

685
00:50:14,587 --> 00:50:17,170
And everybody spit on me.

686
00:50:17,255 --> 00:50:19,755
And Pappy spit on me.

687
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:26,925
The newspaper reporters just kept
hounding me, hounding me...

688
00:50:27,009 --> 00:50:28,592
hounding me and hounding me...

689
00:50:28,677 --> 00:50:31,093
hounding me and hounding me.

690
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:43,433
Stuart...

691
00:50:46,268 --> 00:50:48,935
sorry, but...

692
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,186
could I ask you a question?

693
00:50:55,189 --> 00:50:59,606
Do you think they'll let me out
of this place now that I'm all right?

694
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:07,777
Did you see the man that...

695
00:51:07,862 --> 00:51:10,111
killed Sloan in the kitchen?

696
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,613
Yeah.

697
00:51:13,698 --> 00:51:15,531
I saw him.

698
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:20,408
I was under a table
with two other men.

699
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,869
What was I doing under a table?

700
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:29,329
I didn't see his face, but...

701
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:32,538
I know he had white pants.

702
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:38,124
White pants.

703
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,626
White fence.

704
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:43,960
A stone wall.

705
00:51:45,213 --> 00:51:48,213
A bend in a stone wall!

706
00:51:50,548 --> 00:51:52,464
Lee!

707
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:55,508
We've got to help General Lee!

708
00:51:56,176 --> 00:51:57,801
Come on!

709
00:51:57,885 --> 00:52:00,385
Let's get those damn Yankees!

711
00:52:04,137 --> 00:52:07,471
Come on!

712
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:13,891
White... pants.

714
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:18,059
- Does he ask for me?
- All the time.

716
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:23,062
You have nothing to worry about.

717
00:52:23,146 --> 00:52:25,896
He likes tea, you know?
With lemon in it.

718
00:52:25,981 --> 00:52:28,230
And oatmeal.

724
00:52:50,325 --> 00:52:53,409
The killer is an attendant or a doctor.

725
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:56,827
Stuart couldn't see his face,
but he saw white pants.

726
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:02,079
Tell Swanee that one of the 
other two witnesses will open up.

727
00:53:02,164 --> 00:53:03,914
I feel it.

728
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:08,499
The killer is an attendant or a doctor.

729
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:12,709
Stuart couldn't see his face,
but he saw white pants.

730
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:18,003
Tell Swanee that one of the other two
witnesses will open up. I feel it.

731
00:53:28,926 --> 00:53:31,759
You know, if he went down into a 
coal mine on a disaster story...

732
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:34,386
he'd come up with a little coal dirt
on his face, wouldn't he?

733
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,970
He's getting sick.

734
00:53:36,054 --> 00:53:38,595
He's doing great.
He's been there only 6 weeks...

735
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:41,431
and narrowed the hunt down
to a hospital employee, didn't he?

736
00:53:41,515 --> 00:53:43,348
Something the cops couldn't do.

737
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:46,766
If you don't phone Dr. Cristo right now
and get Johnny out of there tonight, I will.

738
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:49,643
Oh, Cathy, 
you're becoming a nervous wreck.

739
00:53:49,728 --> 00:53:53,478
I'm more worried about you 
outside than I am Johnny inside.

740
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:57,105
- Phone him!
- You phone him!

741
00:53:57,189 --> 00:54:00,857
Call Dr. Cristo, and you lose Johnny
for good, and you know it!

743
00:54:23,618 --> 00:54:25,201
Have a stick of gum.

744
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,953
Have another one. Come on.

745
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:32,121
Chew two.
Open your mouth and chew 'em.

746
00:54:32,205 --> 00:54:33,788
I got five. Come on.

747
00:54:35,874 --> 00:54:37,707
Chew. Chew 'em good.
Put 'em in your mouth.

748
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:41,959
It's very good for you. Here.
It's very good for you. Chew these up.

749
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:43,543
Chew 'em.

750
00:54:44,879 --> 00:54:46,712
A little more.
That'll be just enough.

751
00:54:47,713 --> 00:54:49,463
Chew. Come on. Chew, chew, chew.

752
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:54,048
See, you chew, and your jaw muscles,
they get tired. See?

753
00:54:55,050 --> 00:55:00,301
And then the other muscles, they get
the message and they get tired too. See?

754
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,510
And before you know it...

755
00:55:03,596 --> 00:55:05,262
you're sleeping.

756
00:55:06,138 --> 00:55:09,221
And when we're asleep...

757
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,557
nobody can tell a sane man
from an insane man.

758
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:16,183
Huh?

759
00:55:16,268 --> 00:55:18,060
Good night, Mr. Barrett.

760
00:55:18,144 --> 00:55:19,643
Good night, Mr. Pagliacci.

763
00:55:39,154 --> 00:55:40,653
Did you make Johnny change his mind?

764
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:44,155
I tried, but he's just too 
close to the story now.

765
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,114
That ex-G.I. Stuart has been 
transferred to another floor...

766
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,991
but Johnny is certain that 
Trent or Boden will open up.

767
00:55:50,076 --> 00:55:52,075
Was Dr. Fong with you?

768
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,493
What did he say?

769
00:55:53,577 --> 00:55:56,660
That it's natural for Johnny
to show mental strain.

770
00:55:56,745 --> 00:55:58,578
- What else?
- Well, that's it.

771
00:55:58,662 --> 00:56:00,661
Do you want me
to check with Dr. Fong myself?

772
00:56:00,747 --> 00:56:05,915
Well, he is afraid that the force
driving Johnny can boomerang.

773
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,461
Meaning he could snap? Is that it?

774
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:09,674
Now, don't jump to conclusions.

775
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,438
Look, if I pulled him off now, he'd still suffer
from some kind of depressive psychosis...

776
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:16,528
because he'd never know
what would have happened...

777
00:56:16,612 --> 00:56:20,162
if he had stuck it out long enough
to contact the other witnesses.

778
00:56:20,248 --> 00:56:23,213
You mean if he quits now,
that depression sickness could hit him?

779
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:24,466
Yes.

780
00:56:24,552 --> 00:56:27,099
But if he cracks the murder,
he'll be all right, won't he?

781
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,352
Yes.

782
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:31,068
Do you seriously believe that?

783
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:32,154
Yes!

784
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:33,993
You're crazy!

787
00:57:12,434 --> 00:57:14,605
Oh, no. No, thank you. No.

788
00:57:14,691 --> 00:57:16,528
There is nothing in there
that will hurt you.

789
00:57:16,612 --> 00:57:19,452
Last time I went into a strange room,
I was attacked by amazons.

791
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,752
That's a secret dream most men have.

792
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,136
Well, you try it sometime,
tell me about.

793
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,723
Come on, Mr. Barrett.

795
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:37,461
Something wrong?

796
00:57:37,546 --> 00:57:38,840
No.

797
00:57:38,924 --> 00:57:41,095
Just saw the twitch
in one of your muscles.

798
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:42,683
The one in my head?

799
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:47,781
Tell me, John.

800
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:50,956
Is your desire for your sister
still as strong as ever?

801
00:57:52,128 --> 00:57:56,640
I'll tell you what, Doc. You level me off,
and I'll share all my dreams with you.

802
00:57:57,894 --> 00:57:59,397
I'm cold and sweaty!

803
00:57:59,482 --> 00:58:01,862
Chill sweats are usual in your case.

805
00:58:03,994 --> 00:58:05,915
What is my case?

806
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,743
You're suffering from
a form of dementia praecox...

807
00:58:09,828 --> 00:58:12,115
incident to the age of puberty...

808
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:16,316
characterized by childish behavior...

809
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:18,646
hallucinations...

810
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,892
and emotional deterioration.

811
00:58:32,334 --> 00:58:34,953
"Somebody's sleeping in my bed,"
said the Papa Bear.

812
00:58:35,038 --> 00:58:37,532
Come on. Get up.
Go to your own bed. Go on.

813
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,420
What are you in here for, Mr. Barrett?

814
00:59:03,493 --> 00:59:06,487
"God-haunted Ghost
and the Street of No Return".

815
00:59:06,573 --> 00:59:09,816
Oh, Cathy, what a story
this is going to make!

816
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:18,261
Don't you dare strike me!

817
00:59:18,928 --> 00:59:23,877
I'm pregnant. I've been carrying
my baby for five months now.

818
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:29,785
"God-haunted Ghost".
Not bad for a lead.

819
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:32,531
If only Stuart had held on a little longer.

820
00:59:32,615 --> 00:59:35,609
Another two seconds,
and I'd have cracked this yarn!

821
00:59:44,763 --> 00:59:47,507
Witness number two: Trent.

822
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:49,921
Only Negro student
in a Southern university.

823
00:59:50,005 --> 00:59:52,458
Hobby: collecting pillowcases.

824
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:54,912
- Trent!
- Yes, sir?

825
00:59:54,997 --> 00:59:57,159
- A pillowcase is missing.
- I don't have it, sir.

826
00:59:57,244 --> 01:00:00,071
- It's from your bed!
- I don't have it, sir.

827
01:00:00,156 --> 01:00:02,651
- Want to go back into the hole?
- I don't have it, sir.

828
01:00:02,735 --> 01:00:04,980
- Let him keep it.
- Keep out of this, Wilkes.

829
01:00:05,065 --> 01:00:07,310
Dr. Cristo said not to get him excited.

830
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:09,307
You know what that pillowcase means.

831
01:00:10,224 --> 01:00:12,219
It's all right, Trent.
We know you don't have it.

832
01:00:12,303 --> 01:00:13,258
Thank you, sir.

833
01:00:13,344 --> 01:00:14,507
Come on, Lloyd.

834
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:22,702
He does that every day.
He's reaching out for his nerves.

835
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:25,615
- Friend of yours?
- No. He's a nigger-lover.

836
01:00:25,699 --> 01:00:28,028
Didn't make his kid spit on a black boy.
God punished him.

837
01:00:28,112 --> 01:00:30,690
That's why he's in a catatonic stupor.
Watch this.

838
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,265
Now he's the Statue of Liberty.
What are you doing here?

839
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:39,011
- Visiting a friend.
- So am I, friend. So am I.

840
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,089
The hole is for dangerous
and troublesome people.

841
01:00:42,174 --> 01:00:44,710
- They put me in by mistake.
- So I heard.

842
01:00:44,794 --> 01:00:47,580
- No, you didn't. I just told you.
- That's right.

843
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:50,076
I know why you're shining up to me.
You want to carry my sign.

844
01:00:50,162 --> 01:00:52,448
- No, I don't.
- Calling me a liar?

845
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:53,488
No.

846
01:00:53,573 --> 01:00:55,776
Go make your own sign and carry it.
You coming to the meeting?

847
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,357
What meeting?

848
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,138
I forgot.

849
01:01:05,304 --> 01:01:07,508
Do you know the conductor
of the state symphony orchestra?

850
01:01:07,592 --> 01:01:08,589
No.

851
01:01:08,674 --> 01:01:09,796
I do.

852
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,374
He comes here now and then as 
guest conductor of our own hospital band.

853
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,953
I like him, but, uh, he's mixed up.

854
01:01:16,038 --> 01:01:17,035
How do you mean?

855
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,030
He permits a black boy
to play with white musicians.

856
01:01:20,115 --> 01:01:22,609
Imagine - a black boy!

857
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:28,518
Oh, they're all right as entertainers, but -

858
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:33,426
Let's get him before 
he marries my daughter!

859
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:34,757
Trent! Trent!

860
01:01:35,924 --> 01:01:37,753
Trent! Come on!

861
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:39,832
Trent! Come on, snap out of it!

863
01:01:42,913 --> 01:01:45,616
Trent! Come on!

864
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,403
All right, break it up!
What's the trouble?

865
01:01:48,488 --> 01:01:50,150
- There's no trouble!
- What are you hatching up now?

866
01:01:50,234 --> 01:01:52,313
- He's not hatching up anything!
- I'm talking to him!

867
01:01:52,398 --> 01:01:54,393
Leave him alone.

868
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:56,140
Is everything all right, Trent?

869
01:01:56,225 --> 01:01:57,722
Yes, sir.

870
01:01:57,806 --> 01:01:59,761
No trouble now, Trent.
Promise?

871
01:01:59,844 --> 01:02:01,132
Yes, sir.

872
01:02:03,547 --> 01:02:05,916
Let's check the back ward.
Come on, Lloyd.

873
01:02:11,784 --> 01:02:14,154
Thank you, friend.

874
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:15,736
It's all right, friend.

875
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:26,219
You, uh, ever been on the Mississippi?

876
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,091
No.

877
01:02:28,175 --> 01:02:31,253
You like to watch the paddleboats
go up and down the river?

878
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:36,078
I'd like that.
Yeah, I'd like that.

879
01:02:36,163 --> 01:02:37,826
I know the captain.

880
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:43,566
Mark Twain is a friend of mine.
Come on.

883
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:08,154
Mark Twain!

884
01:03:09,694 --> 01:03:13,437
Whoo! Whoo!

885
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:15,476
I like this trip.

886
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,639
So do I.

887
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,030
What's that?

888
01:03:34,114 --> 01:03:37,940
A sign of the invisible empire.

889
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:41,809
That's a cyclos -
from the Greek word kuklos.

890
01:03:41,895 --> 01:03:43,391
It means circle.

891
01:03:44,973 --> 01:03:48,133
This baptizes a new organization -

892
01:03:48,217 --> 01:03:50,005
the Ku Klux.

893
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:51,836
Sounds good.

894
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,084
No.

895
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:58,243
Ku Klux Klan.

896
01:03:58,327 --> 01:04:01,154
Sounds more mysterious,
more menacing, more alliterative.

897
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:03,608
Ku Klux Klan. Say it.

898
01:04:03,694 --> 01:04:04,940
Ku Klux Klan.

899
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:06,188
- KKK.
- KKK.

900
01:04:06,273 --> 01:04:09,932
It'll catch on quick. It'll drive
those carpetbaggers back north.

901
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:13,511
Scare the hell out of 'em,
tar and feather 'em, hang 'em, burn 'em.

902
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:18,253
- Who are you?
- Your friend.

903
01:04:18,337 --> 01:04:20,582
- I don't know you.
- I got here firstest -

904
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:22,579
With the mostest men.

905
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:26,573
General Forrest.
Nathan Bedford Forrest.

906
01:04:29,238 --> 01:04:30,734
General...

907
01:04:30,818 --> 01:04:34,893
you going around taking 
credit for founding the KKK.

908
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:39,095
I'm the founder. I'm the Grand Wizard.
What's our code word?

909
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,800
"Secrecy".

910
01:04:41,884 --> 01:04:43,879
General...

911
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:49,205
if Christ walked the streets
of my hometown, he'd be horrified.

912
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:52,449
You've never seen so many black people...

913
01:04:52,534 --> 01:04:57,193
cluttering up our schools
and buses and cafes...

914
01:04:57,277 --> 01:05:00,188
and washrooms!

915
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:04,764
I'm for pure Americanism!
White supremacy!

916
01:05:05,764 --> 01:05:07,593
Listen to me, Americans.

917
01:05:07,677 --> 01:05:10,920
America for Americans.

918
01:05:11,006 --> 01:05:14,915
We got to throw rocks
and hurl bombs.

919
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,751
Black bombs for black foreigners!

920
01:05:19,419 --> 01:05:23,420
So they like hot music, do they?

921
01:05:23,504 --> 01:05:26,796
Well, we'll give them a crescendo
they'll never forget!

922
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,922
Burn that freedom bus!

923
01:05:29,007 --> 01:05:31,174
Burn those Freedom Riders!

924
01:05:31,258 --> 01:05:33,924
Burn any man who serves them
at a lunch counter!

925
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:38,802
Burn every dirty, nigger-loving
pocketbook integrationist!

926
01:05:38,888 --> 01:05:43,930
Collect a lot of blackjacks
and good long lengths of pipe.

927
01:05:44,016 --> 01:05:48,100
We'll show those rabble-rousers
they can't breathe our white air...

928
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:51,685
and go to school with our white children.

929
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:54,519
We'll get some infallible liquid
and pour it on 'em!

930
01:05:54,605 --> 01:05:56,855
We'll pour it on their homes
and burn 'em!

931
01:05:56,939 --> 01:05:59,773
Pour it on their pickaninnies
and set them on fire!

932
01:05:59,858 --> 01:06:02,357
Call out of the members
of the White Citizens' Council.

933
01:06:02,443 --> 01:06:06,277
Call out the KKK!
Yes, we'll sponsor the Africans north!

934
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:09,862
Get rid of every black mother,
son and daughter!

935
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:15,032
America for Americans!

936
01:06:16,534 --> 01:06:18,825
- Keep our schools white!
- Keep 'em white!

937
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:20,786
That's right! Keep 'em white!

938
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:23,453
- I'm against Catholics!
- Hallelujah, man! Hallelujah!

939
01:06:23,538 --> 01:06:26,622
Against Jews!

940
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:29,206
Against niggers!

941
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:34,209
Against niggers!

942
01:06:34,294 --> 01:06:35,502
There's one!

943
01:06:37,087 --> 01:06:39,962
Let's get that black boy
before he marries my daughter!

949
01:07:39,331 --> 01:07:40,914
Wednesday...

950
01:07:40,998 --> 01:07:44,499
August 30, 1954.

951
01:07:48,753 --> 01:07:52,587
Wednesday, August 30, 1954.

952
01:07:52,672 --> 01:07:56,840
The U.S. Supreme Court decreed the nation's
schools must be racially desegregated...

953
01:07:56,924 --> 01:07:58,757
with all deliberate speed.

954
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:00,758
I'm a boy in the Amazon jungle.

955
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,801
A brown boy, not a black boy.

956
01:08:02,886 --> 01:08:05,636
Someone is scraping my thigh
with the teeth of the piranha fish...

957
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,428
to change my blood to white blood.

958
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:11,264
I'm a boy in the Amazon jungle.
A brown boy, not a black boy.

959
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:14,015
And someone is scraping my thigh
with the teeth of the piranha fish...

960
01:08:14,101 --> 01:08:16,101
to change my blood to white blood.

961
01:08:16,185 --> 01:08:18,310
August 30, 1954.

962
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:20,894
The U.S. Supreme Court decreed
a ceremonial dance...

963
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,021
to be racially desegregated
with all deliberate speed.

964
01:08:24,107 --> 01:08:26,857
Wednesday, August 30, 1954.

965
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:29,859
The U.S. Supreme Court decreed
a ceremonial dance...

966
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:32,526
to be racially desegregated
with all deliberate speed.

967
01:08:33,195 --> 01:08:34,695
It's the KKK.

968
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:38,780
Run. Run. Run for your life, Trent.
I can't see his face.

969
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,447
Here comes the KKK. Run! Run!

970
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:44,116
Run for your life, Trent.
I can't see his face. I can't see his face.

971
01:08:44,201 --> 01:08:47,952
Here comes the KKK. Run. Run!

972
01:08:48,036 --> 01:08:51,787
I can't see his face. I can't see his face.
Run, Trent! Run!

973
01:08:51,873 --> 01:08:53,372
Run, Trent! Run!

974
01:08:53,456 --> 01:08:55,415
Run, run, run!

975
01:09:04,504 --> 01:09:06,004
Always in color.

976
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:11,215
It's that same nightmare,
always in color.

977
01:09:12,843 --> 01:09:17,719
Strange how I always get my 
mind back after that dream.

978
01:09:23,016 --> 01:09:24,891
What's your name?

979
01:09:24,975 --> 01:09:26,433
Johnny Barrett.

980
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:32,561
I know all about that trouble
you had in that Southern university, Trent.

981
01:09:32,645 --> 01:09:34,937
You don't sound sick to me.

982
01:09:35,022 --> 01:09:36,980
We were in a race riot.

983
01:09:37,065 --> 01:09:39,149
You leading, and me trying
to save your neck.

984
01:09:40,734 --> 01:09:43,442
So you know I was a guinea pig
in a classroom, huh?

985
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,737
The whole country went to school 
with you every day, Trent.

986
01:09:47,821 --> 01:09:50,821
No. I failed.

987
01:09:52,574 --> 01:09:54,574
Well, people were counting on you.

988
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:58,409
Oh, I wish I'd had the guts
to have stuck it out.

989
01:10:01,579 --> 01:10:05,413
I was brought up to have pride in my country.
Called it esprit de corps.

990
01:10:05,498 --> 01:10:07,915
It's inside me. I love it.

991
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,338
It's even a blessing to love my country,
even when it gives me ulcers.

992
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:17,551
And those ulcers will stop...

993
01:10:17,637 --> 01:10:20,221
the day all schools
must get an education...

994
01:10:20,307 --> 01:10:24,519
before being allowed
to open their doors.

995
01:10:25,438 --> 01:10:28,941
Do you know who killed Sloan
with a butcher knife in the kitchen?

996
01:10:29,945 --> 01:10:31,946
I can't blame the students.

997
01:10:33,031 --> 01:10:35,366
They were brought up to hate
the color of my skin.

998
01:10:36,118 --> 01:10:40,456
It's their - their blueprint
for delinquence, the birth of lynchings...

999
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:44,002
the disease carried to those yet unborn.

1000
01:10:44,088 --> 01:10:46,881
Those poor, sick children...

1001
01:10:46,966 --> 01:10:50,468
are taught to depend
on their parents' claws...

1002
01:10:51,806 --> 01:10:53,473
instead of their love.

1003
01:10:54,726 --> 01:10:58,605
And the irony of it is
that many Negroes are mulatto...

1004
01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:03,235
and integration is well established
down south.

1005
01:11:05,657 --> 01:11:08,701
Remember Sloan, who was killed
in the kitchen with a butcher knife?

1006
01:11:08,785 --> 01:11:11,996
I remember the first day
I went to school.

1007
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:14,332
A woman held up her child
so he could reach out...

1008
01:11:14,418 --> 01:11:16,669
and beat me with his little fist.

1009
01:11:18,172 --> 01:11:19,756
Sure, I remember Sloan.

1010
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,760
What was the name of 
the doctor that did it?

1011
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,929
It wasn't a doctor.
It was an attendant.

1012
01:11:27,184 --> 01:11:30,020
I even had a private teacher
to help me to -

1013
01:11:30,104 --> 01:11:32,731
to make sure the university
wouldn't flunk me.

1014
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:34,942
Do you know his name?

1015
01:11:35,028 --> 01:11:37,779
Of course. I saw him kill Sloan, didn't I?

1016
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:42,243
Did you know that my house was 
attacked by night-riding shotgunners?

1017
01:11:42,328 --> 01:11:45,205
- Will you tell me his name?
- Sure.

1018
01:11:48,462 --> 01:11:50,546
You know...

1019
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:53,466
if I hadn't quit school...

1020
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:57,263
I'd have gotten very, very sick.

1021
01:11:57,347 --> 01:11:58,639
Tell me his name!

1022
01:11:59,476 --> 01:12:01,143
Get that nigger!

1023
01:12:01,227 --> 01:12:03,645
He's not going to school
with my daughter.

1024
01:12:03,731 --> 01:12:07,108
First the classrooms, then the school dances.
You know what after that.

1025
01:12:07,194 --> 01:12:08,194
Trent! Trent!

1026
01:12:08,278 --> 01:12:11,155
Go to your own home!
Go to your own school, nigger!

1027
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,491
- Go to your own schools!
- Trent!

1028
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:14,284
- Go to your own black schools, nigger!
- Trent!

1029
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:16,913
- Go to your own black school!
- Trent! Trent!

1030
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:20,417
- I'm for pure Americanism! White supremacy!
- Trent! Listen to me!

1031
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,505
- I'm for pure Americanism! White supremacy!
- Snap out of it! Listen to me!

1032
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,924
Get that freedom bus!
Burn that freedom bus!

1033
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:27,927
- Burn those Freedom Riders!
- Shut up!

1034
01:12:28,012 --> 01:12:29,930
- Shut up!
- Burn those Freedom Riders!

1035
01:12:30,014 --> 01:12:32,974
Trent, shut up! Trent, shut up!

1036
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:50,498
Visiting time over.

1037
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:53,334
That close. I was that close
to getting the killer's real name...

1038
01:12:53,419 --> 01:12:55,045
and, boom, he went nuts again.

1039
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,797
Right back to the hole.

1040
01:12:59,845 --> 01:13:01,720
But there's still Boden.

1041
01:13:04,809 --> 01:13:06,810
I'll reach him.

1042
01:13:06,895 --> 01:13:09,981
I'll get to him, and this time I'm not 
gonna waste one of his sane moments.

1043
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:12,358
I'm gonna ask him right out
all about the murder.

1044
01:13:12,443 --> 01:13:14,236
Boom! I'll get the answer.

1045
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:19,659
You realize, Cathy, I'm sitting
right on top of this story.

1047
01:13:26,086 --> 01:13:28,254
You all right, Cathy?

1048
01:13:28,339 --> 01:13:30,508
Oh, Johnny.

1050
01:13:34,016 --> 01:13:36,351
Don't ever do that!

1051
01:13:36,437 --> 01:13:38,689
Don't you ever kiss me like that again!

1052
01:13:38,773 --> 01:13:40,358
What?

1053
01:13:40,443 --> 01:13:41,944
You know what I mean.

1054
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,242
No, I don't know what you mean, Johnny.
You tell me.

1055
01:13:45,327 --> 01:13:48,122
What do you mean, I should never
kiss you again like that?

1056
01:13:48,207 --> 01:13:50,125
- What's the matter? What is it, Johnny?
- I'm sorry, Miss Barrett...

1057
01:13:50,211 --> 01:13:52,129
but you're exciting the other patients
by shouting!

1058
01:13:52,214 --> 01:13:54,549
- Miss Barrett!
- Johnny, what do you mean? No!

1059
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:55,801
Miss Barrett!

1060
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,398
What's the matter with her?

1062
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:12,414
You're wanted on the phone, Cathy.
Mr. Swanson.

1063
01:14:16,381 --> 01:14:18,925
Cathy? Didn't you hear me?

1064
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:21,096
Mr. Swanson's on the phone.

1066
01:14:47,643 --> 01:14:50,146
- Yes?
- You went to the hospital today, huh?

1067
01:14:50,231 --> 01:14:52,066
Dr. Cristo sent for me.

1068
01:14:52,152 --> 01:14:53,987
Well, why did he send for you?

1069
01:14:54,071 --> 01:14:57,284
Because he wanted my permission...

1070
01:14:57,369 --> 01:15:00,498
to give Johnny electric shock treatments.

1071
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:02,835
Have you lost your marbles?

1072
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,010
Johnny can't take that kind of punishment.
He'll crack. They'll find out he's a fake.

1073
01:15:07,094 --> 01:15:09,680
Oh, I hope they do.

1074
01:15:09,766 --> 01:15:13,103
Then it won't be me who will expose him.
He'll expose himself.

1075
01:15:13,188 --> 01:15:16,067
Well, you should have refused
the electric shock.

1076
01:15:16,152 --> 01:15:18,279
After all, he knows the killer
is an attendant...

1077
01:15:18,364 --> 01:15:22,202
and he's bound to find out his identity
from Boden at the rate he's going.

1078
01:15:22,287 --> 01:15:25,792
At the rate he's going...

1079
01:15:25,877 --> 01:15:28,546
I don't know if he'll know
his own identity.

1080
01:15:28,632 --> 01:15:30,884
What are you talking about?

1081
01:15:33,557 --> 01:15:36,018
He's beginning to think...

1082
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:41,318
that I'm really his sister.

1089
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,884
Cathy!

1091
01:16:30,114 --> 01:16:32,993
What's the matter with my voice?

1092
01:16:33,995 --> 01:16:36,080
Why can't I talk?

1093
01:16:37,168 --> 01:16:38,669
What is it, John?

1094
01:16:40,006 --> 01:16:42,008
Why can't I talk?

1095
01:16:43,428 --> 01:16:45,096
I'll try again.

1096
01:16:45,182 --> 01:16:46,934
Fine.

1097
01:16:47,018 --> 01:16:48,686
I'm fine.

1098
01:16:50,858 --> 01:16:53,194
Was there anything wrong
a moment ago?

1099
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:55,113
No.

1100
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,953
You're not holding anything 
back from me, are you, John?

1101
01:16:58,037 --> 01:17:00,456
No, sir.

1102
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:03,295
Think another shock treatment
might help?

1103
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:07,218
Not unless you strap me in the chair
and throw the switch yourself all the way.

1104
01:17:07,303 --> 01:17:09,472
I've learned my lesson, believe me.

1105
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:12,895
No more race riots in the corridor, huh?

1106
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,148
The way I feel now,
a midget could whip me.

1108
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:18,739
All right, John.

1109
01:17:18,824 --> 01:17:21,578
You can stretch your legs in the 
street during make-friends hour.

1110
01:17:26,587 --> 01:17:29,172
I beat 'em all.

1111
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:31,677
They didn't learn a thing.

1113
01:17:36,438 --> 01:17:38,106
Hey.

1114
01:17:40,361 --> 01:17:42,071
What happened then?

1115
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,621
Why did I lose my power of speech?

1116
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,503
What happened to my voice?

1117
01:18:04,152 --> 01:18:06,154
Witness number 3:

1118
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,909
Dr. Boden, American physicist,
Nobel Prize winner.

1119
01:18:08,994 --> 01:18:10,996
Worked on the atom bomb, the H-bomb.

1120
01:18:11,082 --> 01:18:13,835
The most brilliant scientist alive today.

1121
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,176
Went insane working on nuclear fission -
missiles and rockets to the moon.

1122
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,762
Hobby: drawing.

1123
01:18:19,846 --> 01:18:22,684
Now has the mentality of a child of six.

1124
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:33,869
- Hello.
- Hello.

1125
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:36,124
You been away?

1126
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:38,794
We played games.

1127
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:41,465
You want to play with me?

1128
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:44,137
Good. We'll play hide-and-seek.

1129
01:18:44,222 --> 01:18:45,932
- I'd like that.
- All right.

1130
01:18:46,016 --> 01:18:47,768
You hide your eyes and count to 10.

1131
01:18:47,854 --> 01:18:48,979
Okay.

1135
01:19:07,429 --> 01:19:09,765
Now I wonder where he could be hiding.

1137
01:19:31,137 --> 01:19:33,556
Yes.

1138
01:19:33,642 --> 01:19:34,892
Yes.

1139
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:37,480
Keep it up, John.

1140
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:39,818
Maybe you can help him.
We can't.

1141
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,707
- Wonderful.
- All by myself.

1142
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:52,083
- He's coming along just fine, isn't he?
- Oh, yes.

1143
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:55,916
- Good.
- See? I can do it all by myself.

1144
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,251
Hi. Guess what.

1145
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:01,167
I got Dr. Boden making a portrait of me.

1146
01:20:01,253 --> 01:20:03,085
It's really a professional job.

1147
01:20:03,169 --> 01:20:05,502
He was a wonderful artist
at one time, you know.

1148
01:20:05,586 --> 01:20:09,086
Einstein's hobby was the fiddle,
and Boden's hobby was drawing.

1150
01:20:10,504 --> 01:20:13,253
Still has the mind of a child,
but his hand -

1151
01:20:13,338 --> 01:20:15,420
his hand has the stroke of an adult.

1153
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,838
Imagine me, your Johnny...

1154
01:20:18,922 --> 01:20:20,921
giving therapeutic treatments
to Dr. Boden.

1156
01:20:23,006 --> 01:20:25,172
Oh, you look so much better
than you did the last time.

1157
01:20:25,257 --> 01:20:28,756
Well, you tell Swanee, Boden's apt
to snap back to sanity at any moment...

1158
01:20:28,841 --> 01:20:31,422
and when that happens -
I'll crack that jigsaw.

1159
01:20:31,508 --> 01:20:33,173
What about my perjury?

1160
01:20:33,259 --> 01:20:37,258
Dr. Cristo will be delighted.
Don't you see, Cathy?

1161
01:20:37,342 --> 01:20:40,716
The killer could score another 
victim if he's not exposed.

1162
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:43,175
And the judge will understand
why you lied.

1164
01:20:58,513 --> 01:21:00,262
Dr. Boden.

1165
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:09,138
Dr. Boden wanted.

1166
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:16,098
Dr. Boden wanted at the Pentagon.

1167
01:21:16,183 --> 01:21:19,099
Dr. Boden wanted at
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

1168
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:21,307
Dr. Boden wanted at Newfoundland.

1169
01:21:27,102 --> 01:21:29,101
Dr. Boden wanted.

1170
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:32,852
Dr. Boden -

1171
01:21:32,936 --> 01:21:35,893
Dr. Boden wanted at
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

1172
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:37,893
Dr. Boden wanted at Newfoundland.

1173
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:40,602
Dr. Boden wanted at Newfoundland.

1174
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:42,603
- Dr. Boden wanted at Newfoundland.
...at the Pentagon.

1175
01:21:42,688 --> 01:21:43,936
Not again.

1176
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:48,728
Rockets were fired off in 
Newfoundland in 1953.

1177
01:21:48,814 --> 01:21:51,813
I detected the first hint
of the radiation belt, didn't I?

1178
01:21:53,022 --> 01:21:55,397
Let me alone. I'm through.

1179
01:21:55,481 --> 01:21:57,355
He's rational!

1180
01:21:59,858 --> 01:22:02,606
Hey, not now.

1181
01:22:02,692 --> 01:22:07,816
Oh, God, don't let me
lose my voice now!

1182
01:22:08,651 --> 01:22:10,608
Hold still, John.
You're moving too much.

1183
01:22:13,527 --> 01:22:15,734
You know, John...

1184
01:22:15,819 --> 01:22:19,360
we've become too sophisticated
in the art of death.

1185
01:22:19,444 --> 01:22:22,694
Please, please, let me ask him.

1186
01:22:22,778 --> 01:22:25,819
I've got to ask him!

1187
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:29,112
There's a sense of doom, crises.

1188
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,529
I'll - I'll write the question.

1189
01:22:33,613 --> 01:22:35,946
No-No, it's liable to snap him
back to childhood.

1190
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:38,863
I-I've got to get my voice back!

1191
01:22:40,657 --> 01:22:43,447
We have too many intellectuals
who are afraid to use...

1192
01:22:43,532 --> 01:22:46,030
the pistol of common sense.

1193
01:22:46,783 --> 01:22:48,782
Don't panic!

1194
01:22:49,825 --> 01:22:53,116
John, how can I finish your portrait
when you keep moving around?

1195
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,616
Don't panic now!
Your voice came back in the ward, didn't it?

1196
01:22:56,701 --> 01:22:58,700
Don't panic. It'll come.

1198
01:23:04,369 --> 01:23:05,868
I'm getting it.

1199
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:08,035
Yes, my boy.

1200
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:13,077
I got fed up with man taking a daily
hammer and sickle-coated pill of venom.

1201
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:17,161
If I keep saying it over and over
and over in my mind...

1202
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:19,954
the words will have to jump
out of my mouth!

1203
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:22,662
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?

1204
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,122
I'm a pure scientist.

1205
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:26,580
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?

1206
01:23:26,665 --> 01:23:29,539
Let the Russians claim bigger satellites.

1207
01:23:29,624 --> 01:23:32,373
Now, if they are the first to...

1208
01:23:32,457 --> 01:23:35,623
discover the mating habits
of sea horses...

1209
01:23:35,709 --> 01:23:40,000
must we then race them to discover
the inner structure of a grasshopper's brain?

1210
01:23:40,084 --> 01:23:43,500
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?

1211
01:23:44,168 --> 01:23:46,084
We should take advantage
of our ignorance...

1212
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:48,418
and quit living like tigers -

1213
01:23:48,502 --> 01:23:51,710
tigers in bomb shelters
instead of homes.

1214
01:23:51,795 --> 01:23:54,169
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?

1215
01:23:54,253 --> 01:23:59,003
Today, with all this talk of the panic button,
we're right on the brink of disaster.

1216
01:23:59,088 --> 01:24:01,545
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?

1217
01:24:01,629 --> 01:24:04,712
Today everybody's giving the human race
two weeks to get out.

1218
01:24:05,881 --> 01:24:08,297
Now, I cannot live
with a two-week notice.

1219
01:24:10,298 --> 01:24:12,714
Well, so I quit living.

1220
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,214
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?

1221
01:24:17,049 --> 01:24:19,090
Oh, yes.

1222
01:24:19,174 --> 01:24:21,215
Yeah, I remember Sloan.

1223
01:24:22,675 --> 01:24:26,507
You know, uh, for an insane man,
he had morals.

1224
01:24:27,593 --> 01:24:31,175
I was down in the kitchen with two friends,
and we were under this table.

1225
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:33,301
Who killed him?

1226
01:24:33,386 --> 01:24:35,760
And we saw Sloan
confront this attendant.

1227
01:24:35,845 --> 01:24:37,552
What was his name?

1228
01:24:37,636 --> 01:24:40,302
And Sloan threatened to 
expose him to Dr. Cristo.

1229
01:24:41,721 --> 01:24:43,887
And do you know why?

1230
01:24:43,971 --> 01:24:47,637
For taking sexual advantage
of feeble-minded women...

1231
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:49,637
in the ladies' ward.

1232
01:24:49,722 --> 01:24:51,470
Who killed Sloan?

1233
01:24:51,556 --> 01:24:52,680
Wilkes.

1234
01:24:52,764 --> 01:24:57,055
Wilkes! I've broken the story! Thank God!

1235
01:24:57,891 --> 01:24:59,639
Take a look, John.
It's a perfect likeness.

1236
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:04,891
What's that?

1237
01:25:05,933 --> 01:25:07,932
Well, it's your portrait, of course.

1238
01:25:08,017 --> 01:25:09,974
You must be crazy.
That's not me.

1239
01:25:10,893 --> 01:25:12,725
I only draw what I see, John.

1240
01:25:13,602 --> 01:25:15,726
That's not me!

1241
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,767
Oh! I don't - I don't want to play!

1242
01:25:17,852 --> 01:25:20,059
I don't want to -
I don't want to play!

1243
01:25:20,144 --> 01:25:22,518
- That's not me!
- I don't want to play!

1244
01:25:22,603 --> 01:25:25,810
That's not me! That's not me!

1245
01:25:25,896 --> 01:25:28,312
Will you -
That's not me!

1248
01:25:35,022 --> 01:25:36,312
That's not me!

1250
01:25:39,315 --> 01:25:40,897
That's not me!

1252
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:49,148
That's not me!
Ah, that's not me!

1253
01:25:49,233 --> 01:25:50,982
That's not me!

1254
01:25:51,066 --> 01:25:53,482
Not me!

1255
01:25:53,567 --> 01:25:56,608
That's not me!

1256
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,483
- I don't want to play.
- That's not me!

1257
01:25:58,568 --> 01:26:01,650
- That's not me!
- I don't want to play anymore with you.

1258
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:05,235
I - I'm not gonna play...

1259
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,736
with you anymore.

1260
01:26:10,403 --> 01:26:12,444
Dr. Cristo...

1261
01:26:12,529 --> 01:26:14,737
I know who killed Sloan in the kitchen.

1262
01:26:15,487 --> 01:26:17,403
You've been hearing stories
from a patient.

1263
01:26:17,488 --> 01:26:19,821
No, no, no. I'm telling you,
I remember.

1264
01:26:19,906 --> 01:26:23,113
So you call the paper
and tell Swanee that I know.

1265
01:26:23,197 --> 01:26:25,322
I know who the killer is.

1266
01:26:25,406 --> 01:26:27,196
It's Dr. Cristo.

1267
01:26:28,073 --> 01:26:30,072
No.

1268
01:26:30,157 --> 01:26:31,614
It's Cathy.

1269
01:26:31,699 --> 01:26:33,531
No.

1270
01:26:33,617 --> 01:26:35,741
I killed Sloan.

1271
01:26:35,825 --> 01:26:37,657
Yeah, I killed Sloan.

1272
01:26:38,992 --> 01:26:40,574
I killed him.

1273
01:26:40,659 --> 01:26:42,783
- Wilkes?
- Yes, sir?

1274
01:26:44,243 --> 01:26:48,242
Keep him under restraint
until further orders.

1275
01:26:50,369 --> 01:26:52,201
Killed Sloan.

1276
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:02,245
Are you sure you killed Sloan?

1277
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:03,870
Sure, I'm sure.

1278
01:27:05,747 --> 01:27:08,746
No.

1279
01:27:08,831 --> 01:27:10,496
Cathy did.

1280
01:27:10,581 --> 01:27:12,663
Cathy killed Sloan.

1281
01:27:12,749 --> 01:27:14,956
Why are you interested in Sloan?

1282
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:17,332
Wilkes killed him.

1283
01:27:17,416 --> 01:27:18,915
Who told you I killed him?

1284
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,665
Dr. Cristo.

1285
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:24,497
No. Cathy did.

1286
01:27:26,081 --> 01:27:27,580
Cathy killed him.

1287
01:27:28,998 --> 01:27:30,996
Cathy killed Sloan.

1288
01:27:33,663 --> 01:27:35,620
Cathy did it.

1290
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,953
Cathy killed Sloan.

1292
01:27:42,621 --> 01:27:44,994
Why should Cathy kill him?

1295
01:28:02,909 --> 01:28:06,323
Somebody do something about my head!

1296
01:28:06,408 --> 01:28:08,823
Help my head!

1297
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:11,072
It hurts!

1299
01:28:24,988 --> 01:28:28,194
Why aren't you taking a 
little walk in the street?

1300
01:28:35,819 --> 01:28:37,318
With these on?

1301
01:28:37,403 --> 01:28:38,985
- What's wrong with them?
- It's embarrassing.

1302
01:28:39,069 --> 01:28:40,901
That's a good sign.
How's the headache?

1303
01:28:40,985 --> 01:28:42,733
Gone. I lost it in the hole.

1304
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,108
- You know who I am?
- Dr. Cristo.

1305
01:28:45,192 --> 01:28:47,899
That's Mr. Wilkes, Mr. Lloyd,
and I'm a different man.

1306
01:28:49,234 --> 01:28:51,024
Who killed Sloan?

1307
01:28:51,692 --> 01:28:53,982
I wish I could remember the name.

1308
01:28:55,066 --> 01:28:58,772
Watch it now.
This may be a trap!

1309
01:28:58,857 --> 01:29:01,730
Two attendants here.
Could be one of them.

1310
01:29:01,815 --> 01:29:02,771
Who?

1311
01:29:02,857 --> 01:29:04,605
Sloan.

1312
01:29:04,690 --> 01:29:06,147
Who's Sloan?

1313
01:29:09,564 --> 01:29:11,062
Remove it.

1314
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:17,394
Well, I think it's time you got
a little exercise, John.

1315
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:18,978
Thank you, Doctor.

1316
01:29:20,312 --> 01:29:23,143
Wilkes, relieve Kellogg in Hydro, eh?

1317
01:29:23,228 --> 01:29:24,727
Yes, sir.

1318
01:29:35,684 --> 01:29:37,974
I think you're making progress, John.

1319
01:29:38,058 --> 01:29:39,806
Real progress.

1320
01:29:42,391 --> 01:29:44,306
He gave me the name of the killer.

1321
01:29:44,391 --> 01:29:48,514
He named the killer,
and I can't remember!

1322
01:29:48,599 --> 01:29:51,388
I just don't understand!

1323
01:29:51,473 --> 01:29:54,346
He handed the story to me
right on a platter!

1324
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:57,387
Right on a platter.
He gave me the name. I've got to -

1325
01:29:57,472 --> 01:30:00,013
Why can't I think of a name?

1326
01:30:00,097 --> 01:30:01,387
Name!

1327
01:30:01,471 --> 01:30:04,969
I can't remember the name
of the killer!

1330
01:30:31,466 --> 01:30:34,214
- Did you feel that?
- What?

1331
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:36,043
It's beginning to rain.

1332
01:30:37,292 --> 01:30:39,035
I like the rain.

1342
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:57,228
That was such a sour note, John.

1343
01:32:57,312 --> 01:33:00,511
You were way off-key.

1345
01:33:30,603 --> 01:33:33,178
I remember. Wilkes. Wilkes!

1346
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:38,331
Dr. Cristo, you've got to listen to me.
You've got to let me out of here. Please.

1347
01:33:38,417 --> 01:33:40,826
Call my paper. Talk to Swanee.
He'll tell you why I'm here.

1348
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:43,901
- Now, John, don't start that again.
- Wilkes killed Sloan. I swear it!

1349
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:45,480
Get Wilkes. I can prove it!

1350
01:33:45,565 --> 01:33:48,140
- I thought you killed him, John.
- Doctor, I'm not nuts!

1351
01:33:48,225 --> 01:33:50,841
I'm here for the paper!
I'm a plant!

1352
01:33:52,298 --> 01:33:54,375
Now forget all about Sloan, huh?

1354
01:33:55,539 --> 01:33:57,450
Why don't you keep Pagliacci company?

1355
01:33:57,534 --> 01:33:59,611
Have him sing La Boheme for you.

1356
01:33:59,696 --> 01:34:01,191
Yes, sir.

1357
01:34:06,138 --> 01:34:10,002
Where did Cristo send Wilkes? Where?

1358
01:34:10,086 --> 01:34:13,285
I remember.
Hydro. Hydrotherapy!

1359
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:18,979
I remember! Hydrotherapy!

1365
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:07,164
Who killed Sloan?

1366
01:36:07,248 --> 01:36:09,782
Tell me, or I'll tear 'em off!

1367
01:36:09,867 --> 01:36:12,858
Tell me, or I'll tear your ears off!

1368
01:36:12,942 --> 01:36:15,476
Who killed Sloan?

1369
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:22,666
Who killed Sloan?

1370
01:36:23,499 --> 01:36:29,067
Who killed Sloan?

1371
01:36:32,559 --> 01:36:33,805
Tell me!

1372
01:36:33,889 --> 01:36:36,382
I killed Sloan!

1376
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:56,164
Now, if you don't mind...

1377
01:36:56,249 --> 01:36:58,326
I'd like you to call my paper...

1378
01:36:58,410 --> 01:37:01,983
and ask Swanee to confirm
that I was a plant here.

1379
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:04,975
That is a load off my mind, Doc.

1380
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,677
He was sane enough
to write that story.

1381
01:37:07,761 --> 01:37:09,880
He has been sane for weeks.

1382
01:37:09,965 --> 01:37:13,122
Don't you stand there and tell me
that there's nothing you can do for him.

1383
01:37:13,996 --> 01:37:15,117
Why?

1384
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:19,356
Why is he like that?

1385
01:37:21,019 --> 01:37:22,847
Oh, God in heaven.

1386
01:37:22,932 --> 01:37:26,547
Well, a man can't tamper with a mind
and live in a mental hospital...

1387
01:37:26,631 --> 01:37:30,162
and subject himself to all kinds of tests
