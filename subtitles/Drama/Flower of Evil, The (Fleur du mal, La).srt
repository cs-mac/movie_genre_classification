[TNC Manager
Rena Jeong]

3
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:48,767
I was going to leave quietly
because I'm so embarrassed and sorry.

4
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:51,999
I won't make it long.

5
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:56,067
Whatever excuses I make,
I know I'm unforgivable.

6
00:00:56,067 --> 00:01:03,999
Regard it as that you were unlucky
to meet a greedy, arrogant woman.

7
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:09,334
Even if you hold it against me for long,
I'll accept it.

8
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:15,999
You told me not to say this,
butI guess it will be the last time.

9
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:20,200
I am sorry and
thank you for everything.

10
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,801
Do you think it's over
once you had your say?

11
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,999
You should hear
me out, too.

12
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:08,367
Why are you so late?
I waited for a long time.

13
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:09,999
Give me your bag.

14
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:13,901
Why are you out? You're worried
someone might kidnap this beauty?

15
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:17,999
Beauty? They kidnap pigs
regardless of looks.

16
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:19,200
Hey!

17
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:24,999
I'm glad to see
you smile again.

18
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:28,834
I was worried that you were
kicked out in with a false charge.

19
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:34,601
See? I told you my boss
was really a good person.

20
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:40,434
I'm happier that my trust in her
was proven right than being reinstated.

21
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:44,200
Then what will become of her?
Will she be fired?

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,999
No way! Strictly speaking,
she isn't to blame, either.

23
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:53,999
And since the Director and the Chairman
put full trust in her, she'll be alright.

24
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:58,801
I'm extremely tired
from this heartache.

25
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,667
Come on!

26
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,634
What?

27
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,999
You're tired.
Get on my back.

28
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:16,634
You can't carry me.
If you do, you'll hurt your back.

29
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:19,999
So hungry. Let's go home quickly
and have bibimbap.

30
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,734
Let's see who
gets there first!

31
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,734
Hurry up! I'm hungry!

32
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:35,133
Hey Kang Yi Sol!
Wait for me!

33
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,999
Why, you can't sleep?

34
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:03,667
Darn it.
I'm worried to death.

35
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:07,834
Didn't the statement of apology
conclude the case?

36
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:12,334
Not really.
That's just the start.

37
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:18,999
Usually, accidents are given banner
headlines, but apologies are not.

38
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:25,999
Sales will be down and
we'll have to deal with the aftermath.

39
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:30,033
But Min Jun is tough.

40
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:33,999
He can pull through it
so don't worry too much.

41
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,100
When you talk like that,
you're like a stranger.

42
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,999
You sure are a stepmother.

43
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:44,000
What do you mean?

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,999
Rena Jeong was
his right-hand woman.

45
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:54,133
And she left him in this situation.
How drained he must be now.

46
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:57,999
But you're saying I should
just sit back and watch.

47
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:02,999
I told you I didn't feel good
about her from the beginning.

48
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:09,999
She's a shallow person and no help
to Min Jun. It's all the better she left.

49
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:10,999
Still, I'm upset with you.

50
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,701
It doesn't matter
if you're upset.

51
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,999
You are my only husband
in the world.

52
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:25,234
If you fret your health away,
I won't forgive you.

53
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:30,999
Huh? Is that
what you meant?

54
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,999
Alright.

55
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,534
In fact, I almost fell over
with the shock a few times.

56
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,934
Honey.

57
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:44,033
Don't worry. I will be fine since
you care about me so much.

58
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:53,567
Like you said, I'll leave the matter
to Min Jun and take care of myself.

59
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,601
Let's sleep.

60
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,200
Being here reminds me
of my days in New York.

61
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,999
Have you walked along
the Hudson River?

62
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:21,999
The Hudson River?

63
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:28,400
When I was too distressed to sleep,
I used to walk there at daybreak.

64
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,467
It was very foggy.

65
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:36,999
Walking alone through the fog
calmed my mind as if by magic.

66
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:40,999
What caused you
sleepless nights?

67
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:47,033
I was betrayed by
someone I had trusted.

68
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:53,334
Since then, it was really
hard for me to trust people.

69
00:06:53,999 --> 00:07:00,501
I thought I didn't need people
by my side for a long time.

70
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,033
I really thought so.

71
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:11,999
It's been quite a while since I last felt
reassured having someone by my side.

72
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:20,400
If I hold on to you,
will you stay with me?

73
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:26,167
We'll face a lot of difficulties.
But if you trust me and...

74
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:32,999
Having me by your side
won't be of any help to you.

75
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,334
I'm the one who caused this crisis.
Who would accept me?

76
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,999
What if I don't care?

77
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:45,300
I don't care.
So stand by me.

78
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,534
No, I don't want to.

79
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:52,267
I'm not sure I can work
in that atmosphere.

80
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:59,434
I'd rather leave now than feel guilty
and distressed working with you.

81
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:01,801
I mean it.

82
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:08,467
If you care about me,
please let me go.

83
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:30,999
I understand.

84
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:43,999
Take it.
It's yours anyway.

85
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:03,667
I was going to give it to you
at the Jinmao Tower.

86
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,999
Mr. Park, this is...

87
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:08,999
It's doesn't mean anything
so don't feel burdened.

88
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:15,100
You said you've never had
a good relationship in your life.

89
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:19,868
Our relationship
ends like this,

90
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:24,200
...but since that ring
brings happiness,

91
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,999
...I wish you
a good relationship.

92
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:51,267
Don't give it to anybody
if you don't like it.

93
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:55,999
It's more expensive
than your one-dollar ring.

94
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,367
Did you find a job?

95
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:31,601
No. I'll have to look
for one from now.

96
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:41,300
You can come back if you want anytime.
I'll leave your position vacant.

97
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:52,767
If you meet someone and give them
a hard time, it's not a good relationship.

98
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:58,434
I won't return to you.

99
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:07,999
I wish you health
and happiness.

100
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,999
Don't look back.
It's all over.

101
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:46,200
I already cast the dice.

102
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,033
Now it's all or nothing.

103
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,367
My mouth feels sandy.

104
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:10,367
Have some more.
It's your favorite yellow corvina.

105
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:15,234
Right. Eat a little more
for your loving son.

106
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:19,999
I'm going to go to temple
tomorrow morning.

107
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:20,999
Why?

108
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:26,501
I'll pray to Buddha with my mother.
We can support Min Jun with prayer.

109
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:31,767
What are you talking about?
I won't go. Never. You go alone.

110
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,000
It's not that you won't,
but you can't.

111
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,334
She's forbidden
to enter the temple.

112
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,999
Forbidden? How come?

113
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:42,901
Last time she went there to pray,
she ordered pork...

114
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:45,999
...and was caught by the
chief priest. Hang it.

115
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,934
You bigmouth!

116
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,100
I'm going to work.

117
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,999
Why?

118
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:59,934
It's Saturday, but staff are having an
emergency meeting, so I need to stop by.

119
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:02,100
Wait. Maid...

120
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,999
Yes, here you are.

121
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:07,968
Give this to Min Jun.

122
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:11,999
It's red ginseng brewed all night.
This is all I can do for him.

123
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,999
Thank you. He'll handle it well
with your concern.

124
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:29,434
Yi Sol, can you guess the
profound meaning of these shoes?

125
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,999
Your love will walk away from you if you
give her a pair, so I'm giving you two.

126
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:38,999
If you ever walk away from me,
come back to me.

127
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:47,999
What are these shoes for?
They're so pretty!

128
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:52,467
Hey, they're not for you.

129
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:55,999
I know.
They are for Yi Sol, right?

130
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,133
No.

131
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:04,999
Love is timing. If you just keep looking
at her, someone will snatch her.

132
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:08,667
Hey, be quiet!
Yi Sol might hear you.

133
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,999
Do you need my support?

134
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:13,634
Don't mess it up!

135
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:18,999
I'm going to confess today.

136
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:22,234
Jae Jun.

137
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:27,999
Are you going somewhere?
Yura will be here shortly.

138
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,901
She prepared food
for your father's health.

139
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:36,999
Can't you hear me?

140
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,267
You need to earn points with
your father during times like this.

141
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,434
How can you just watch?

142
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:44,999
What good is it to
earn points with him?

143
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:49,467
Step on Min Jun and gain a mere
hospital in Qingdao, that's all.

144
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:52,634
What?
A mere hospital?

145
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:53,200
Yes.

146
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,999
It's a mere hospital to me.

147
00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:03,033
Let me be clear. Fixing the normal
faces for money is not what I want to do.

148
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,999
So forget about
the Qingdao hospital.

149
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:09,167
Forget about it?
Don't you tell me that!

150
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,000
Mom.

151
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,999
I clearly told you there
can't be two suns in the sky.

152
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:18,400
Min Jun's crisis
is your chance.

153
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,501
Listen to me. Get engaged
to Yura and please your father.

154
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,999
Then you can step over Min Jun.

155
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:28,999
Please mom!

156
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:31,999
That's why I can't even
go to comfort him...

157
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:35,868
...lest I score
a hit with Father.

158
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,634
Can't you stop now?

159
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:43,334
You acting like
an unselfish stepmother...

160
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:46,100
...makes me sick.

161
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,701
What?

162
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,667
This is not a family!

163
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:57,400
We sit around
the table and act caring,

164
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,300
...but at heart, we wish others'
failure in jealousy.

165
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,968
Are we a family?

166
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:04,734
Who do you think this is for?

167
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,968
For whom do you think I play
the hypocrite all my life?

168
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:13,501
If it's for me, stop. I'm not
interested in the Qingdao hospital.

169
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:19,999
Living as a true family caring
for each other even if it's only a day...

170
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:23,999
That's my wish. Please.

171
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:39,167
True family?

172
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,999
To hell with it.
You're not even blood-related.

173
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:49,133
Practice.

174
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:58,067
Can't you hear me?
One, two!

175
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:01,999
Father, how concerned
you must be.

176
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:08,901
Barley thrives after a snow,
and ground packs after a rain.

177
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:14,999
I have no doubt that TNC will
become more solid after this incident.

178
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:20,934
Please have the health food I
prepared and recover your strength.

179
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:25,901
Yeah, very good.
Every crisis is an opportunity.

180
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:31,267
Use this opportunity and get your
parents-in-law and Jae Jun on your side.

181
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,934
Understand?

182
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:39,234
Why should I do that?
Acting coy is not me.

183
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:42,801
Why should I deny myself
to play a prudish lady?

184
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,534
You really don't know?

185
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:49,999
Your true self is a super playgirl,
good for nothing.

186
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:55,999
By playing coy or whatever,
captivate Jae Jun today, okay?

187
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,999
I think it'll be difficult.

188
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:02,400
What?

189
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,999
Look. Jae Jun knows I'm going.
He's is getting away.

190
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,133
What's this?

191
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,834
He knows we're coming.
Where is he going?

192
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:28,999
What are you going to do?

193
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:39,999
I'm leaving home now. You didn't
forget we're going to the sea today, right?

194
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:43,999
Yi Sol! Come on, let's go.

195
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,734
Hey! We're ready.
Let's go.

196
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:50,999
Dong Gu rented a tent, a van, and
everything from his employee. Let's go.

197
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:51,999
Where are we going?

198
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:57,133
You forgot? We're going camping
today to comfort you.

199
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,434
We'll sleep over
in a tent tonight.

200
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:02,434
Oh, right. What should I do?
I have another engagement.

201
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,999
No way! This is our first family trip
since we came back to Korea.

202
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:10,999
-No, you can't pull out.
-Right.

203
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:37,200
Mom, let's just go back.

204
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,267
Maybe he's going on a trip alone.
Leave him alone.

205
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:43,999
Be quiet.
He's not alone.

206
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,334
I'm sorry.
I'm late, aren't I?

207
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:53,901
It's okay we're not late.
We have plenty of time.

208
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:57,801
Who's that tall brat?

209
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:59,767
Wait.

210
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,534
I'm sorry, but I can't go to
the sea again this time.

211
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,767
Something happened?

212
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:09,999
I forgot I had a previous engagement.
A family camping trip.

213
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:15,999
Everybody looked forward to today,
so I can't back out. Sorry.

214
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,734
Really? I looked
forward to today, too.

215
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,999
Sorry.

216
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:26,999
That's okay. They must be
waiting for you, so go ahead.

217
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:28,999
What are you going to do?

218
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:33,999
I felt heavy so I needed
some fresh air. I'll go alone.

219
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,868
Get going, dumpling.

220
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,434
Sorry. Next time we'll go
together for sure.

221
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:40,999
I'm really sorry.

222
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:56,999
Come with me.

223
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:57,667
To where?

224
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:01,367
Camping. It looks sad
to take a trip alone.

225
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,999
I'll relieve your stress.
Come with me.

226
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,968
Are you sure I can join you?

227
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:08,999
Of course.
They will welcome you.

228
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:21,999
What the heck.
He has a girlfriend?

229
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:24,999
I'm going to...!

230
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:29,999
Wait. I think I've
seen her before.

231
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,400
Where did I see her?

232
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,999
Do you know her? How?

233
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:37,999
Wait. Gosh, I think too much
alcohol killed my brain cells.

234
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:45,434
Right! Kaohsiung,
the date-for- hire!

235
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:47,267
Date-for-hire?

236
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,501
Oh, the masseur?

237
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:56,999
How could she be here?
She lives in Kaohsiung.

238
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,901
Are you sure?

239
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:03,834
Yes, I'm sure.
I have good eyesight.

240
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,467
Check with the
massage shop. Hurry.

241
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:12,467
It's the most famous shop
so there must be a number.

242
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:13,999
Here it is.

243
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,999
[Hello, I'm calling
to ask something.]

244
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:22,033
[Does the Korean masseur
still work there?]

245
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:29,601
Who the heck is that chap?

246
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:37,999
It's him. The one who made
Yi Sol cry a lot back in Kaohsiung.

247
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:43,634
What? The date partner
who broke her heart?

248
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:49,999
Is it fate? Why'd they meet again?
I don't like him.

249
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:54,667
You're not the only one
who doesn't like him.

250
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:26,133
Please stop!

251
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:36,567
What a brutal atmosphere. We're
going to shoot a film, 'Dual in the Wilds.'

252
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:40,999
You'll see. I'll act harshly
to him to shake him off.

253
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
A girl?

254
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:54,999
My Jae Jun?
Maybe you're mistaken.

255
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:59,999
No. Yura and I saw
it with our own eyes.

256
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:04,434
Can you guess who she is?

257
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:07,999
Guess? You mean
I know her?

258
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,801
Of course.

259
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:16,133
Remember Jae Jun lost his
heart to a lousy girl in Kaohsiung?

260
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,200
The masseur?

261
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,300
No way.
She can't be in Korea.

262
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,968
I checked. She moved
to Seoul two months ago.

263
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:28,999
Seems they've bee
 seeing each other.

264
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:31,667
They looked so intimate.

265
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:37,167
I think they took a trip together
since they met at the train station.

266
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:41,067
No way. Jae Jun is
not that kind of a boy.

267
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,999
The person you have
dialed is not available...

268
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:49,567
He not
answering, huh?

269
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:58,067
He must be on the trip like Yura said.
Why would he answer your call?

270
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:06,934
Do you know anything
else about her?

271
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:11,100
No. All I know is
her name, Kang Yi Sol.

272
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,067
Kang Yi Sol.

273
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:16,999
Kang Yi Sol? I've heard
that name before.

274
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:21,999
I heard a rookie copied
the rainbow pizza.

275
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:26,999
Father, what's the
name of that rookie?

276
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,999
Kang Yi Sol something.

277
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:38,999
Right, the rookie.
That's why he asked.

278
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:42,367
Rookie?
What do you mean?

279
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:47,999
Let me promise one thing.

280
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:51,434
I'm sorry I didn't
discipline him well.

281
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:56,999
I'll make him finish with her quickly.
Please understand for today.

282
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:59,999
But they looked so intimate.

283
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,999
Trust me. I told you.

284
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:07,834
He's bound to come
back to my arms.

285
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:13,000
I will separate them
by all means.

286
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:20,234
Smells good.

287
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,999
Please sit here. I'll do it, Father.

288
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,999
'Father?'

289
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:30,999
Are we that familiar to each other?
I don't have a son like you.

290
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:33,467
Oh.

291
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:37,999
Mother, let me go wash these.

292
00:26:38,234 --> 00:26:40,999
'Mother'? No need.

293
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,267
Don't get in the way
and just go sit over there.

294
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:50,701
Jae Jun, she doesn't put
a guest to work. Go get some rest.

295
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,999
Shall I?

296
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:55,999
Then I'll go help them
set up the tent.

297
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:01,999
Mom! What's wrong with you?

298
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,999
Can't you be nice
to my friend?

299
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:08,999
Have you no pride? How could
you bring that jerk here?

300
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:12,734
He's not a bad guy.
Please be nice to him.

301
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:17,868
Mr. Huh, please don't be
mean to him. I beg you.

302
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:21,601
Go away!
You're of no help!

303
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:23,999
Go away!
Please go away!

304
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:26,534
No one welcomes
you here.

305
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:31,400
Exactly. We brought rice
only for six people.

306
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,999
If I'm short of rice,
it's your fault.

307
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:47,100
Aren't you hungry?

308
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,999
Let's eat.

309
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:53,999
I'm fine. You brought food
only for six people.

310
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:58,033
A man can't get sulk just
because of that? Come on.

311
00:27:58,033 --> 00:28:00,601
I said I'm fine.

312
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,567
I'm not hungry from the
negativity I've received all day.

313
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:07,834
Are you really
not going to eat?

314
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,434
Alright.

315
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:18,000
It's so delicious
out here in the open air!

316
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,701
Come on!
Don't be mad and just eat.

317
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:30,167
I'm really full!
I am full!

318
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:43,999
Even my stomach
is so uncooperative.

319
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:49,868
Isn't it delicious?

320
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:51,033
Yes.

321
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,133
Have some sausages.

322
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,334
Where is Yi Sol?

323
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:09,999
Dong Gu, I told you
love is timing.

324
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,467
This is no time for you
to cook meat here.

325
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,999
Go give her the shoes
and confess your feelings.

326
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:21,567
Since she doesn't know your feelings
for her, she fell for him.

327
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:31,334
It's good!

328
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:36,167
By the way, why does
your family hate me?

329
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:40,999
I didn't expect a big welcome, but
I didn't know they'd be mean to me.

330
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:44,999
Actually, it's because of me.

331
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:52,999
My mom saw everything when you
gave me money at the massage shop.

332
00:29:56,734 --> 00:30:00,968
That day, I was so upset
and cried a lot.

333
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:04,999
And it broke the
my family's hearts.

334
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:12,701
Weren't you resentful of me?
My pride from having money?

335
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,434
No, I wasn't.

336
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:29,033
I was rather distressed because
we ended like that when I was serious.

337
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:35,999
Also I was sad since I thought
I couldn't see you again.

338
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:49,834
I'm sorry. I'll never
let that happen again.

339
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:59,999
Shall we go? I will soften
the hearts of your family.

340
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:02,999
Yay!

341
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:03,968
Yay.

342
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:05,067
Yay!

343
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:25,234
Is the name of the new recruit
who caused the incident Kang Yi Sol?

344
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:27,033
Yes, that's right.

345
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:32,999
Can I see her face?

346
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:33,999
Pardon?

347
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:37,133
It's because
I think I know her.

348
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:40,367
I see. Her resume should be
on the company website.

349
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:47,999
Please take a look ma'am.

350
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,999
This one.

351
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:15,801
How did she join TNC? She didn't get
the job through open recruit, did she?

352
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,999
Tell me. How did
she join the company?

353
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:23,999
In fact, it was
Director Park's order.

354
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:29,000
I knew it.

355
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,434
It was Min Jun as expected.

356
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:39,300
What a fresh air.
And I'm full.

357
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,734
-Father?
-Yes.

358
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:45,999
Now we're comfortable
without him being around.

359
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:51,133
Exactly. I've never seen
such a clumsy guy.

360
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:54,334
If I were him,
I would've left earlier.

361
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,501
But he has the nerves
to eat our food.

362
00:32:58,501 --> 00:33:01,999
That's not all. He's jobless.

363
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:03,033
What?

364
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:09,734
How come when he has an able body?
He could do any manual labor.

365
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,567
He has the wrong mentality.

366
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:18,067
That's why a girl hired Yi Sol to date him
in her place back in Kaohsiung.

367
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:22,534
Yi Sol isn't clever either.
How could she see him of all guys?

368
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:27,000
I know. When there's
a nice guy like Dong Gu.

369
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,701
We're back, Father, Mother.

370
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:32,167
I thought you left.

371
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:35,999
No. Eat some dessert.
Jae Jun bought these.

372
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:39,300
This is your favorite icy soju.

373
00:33:40,334 --> 00:33:42,667
This is your favorite beer.

374
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:46,701
Uncle, I mean brother.

375
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:49,634
Do you have my
favorite ice cream?

376
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:51,999
Of course.
Pick what you want.

377
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,999
I'll take this.

378
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:59,434
Oppa, I'll take this.

379
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:00,999
Give it to me.

380
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:04,934
Mr. Park Jae Jun.

381
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:09,234
We don't need this.
Please leave.

382
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:12,999
Right. I don't need
this, either.

383
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:16,334
This makes me feel flatulent.

384
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:22,999
See? No one welcomes
you here. Please go back.

385
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:27,367
Dong Gu, what's wrong with you?
I told you he's my friend.

386
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,834
Friend?

387
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,999
How can he be your friend?

388
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:37,999
He insulted you in Kaohsiung,
and how did he treat you at the club?

389
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:40,767
Did you forget he looked
down you becuase he had money?

390
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:44,999
I told you. It was a misunderstanding
and that won't happen again.

391
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,133
He isn't that kind
of man you think.

392
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:52,467
He's the only one who believed my
innocence and supported me. So please...

393
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:57,167
No, Yi Sol. He's right.

394
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:04,434
Forgive me. I was thoughtless
and hurt her feelings a lot.

395
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:07,000
From now on,
I'll do my best...

396
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,667
...to Yi Sol and
to her family that loves her.

397
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:16,968
I will never break
your hearts again. Believe me.

398
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:24,234
I think I made a mistake today
when this is your family trip.

399
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:28,200
I'll visit you often until
you forgive me.

400
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,999
Goodbye.

401
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:31,567
Jae Jun.

402
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:33,400
I'll leave.
See you.

403
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,801
Jae Jun, Jae Jun.

404
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:44,434
You're so mean!
Do you have to send him like that?

405
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,999
Can't you accept him for me?

406
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:48,767
Hey, we're all
worried about you!

407
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:53,100
You don't have to,
because I'm so happy.

408
00:35:53,999 --> 00:36:00,734
It's the first time I've felt
like this in my 23 years of living!

409
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:07,999
When he's out of sight, I miss him,
care about him, and wish him the best.

410
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,999
When he's with me,
I smile and feel thrilled.

411
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:21,999
I really like him.

412
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:24,999
I like him a lot.

413
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:36,999
But if you don't like him,
I will wait.

414
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:40,999
I'll wait until you accept him.

415
00:36:56,999 --> 00:37:01,968
Mr. Park Jae Jun!
Mr. Park Jae Jun!

416
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:07,999
Come with me.
Yi Sol is waiting for you.

417
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:11,067
Excuse me?
You mean...

418
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:14,100
Let me give you
one warning.

419
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:20,999
If you ever make
her cry again, then I...

420
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:23,999
...I will not forgive you.

421
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:28,999
Thank you, Mr. Heo Dong Gu.

422
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,999
I'll really be good to her.

423
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,901
Thank you.

424
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,999
What brings you here?

425
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:57,834
What's your intention?

426
00:37:57,834 --> 00:37:58,000
Excuse me?

427
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,100
Your intention
for hiring Kang Yi Sol.

428
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,734
There's no intention. Jae Jun asked me
a favor and I found her talented, so...

429
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:11,999
Even so, didn't you know
you shouldn't do that?

430
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:15,999
You could tell they are
in no ordinary relationship.

431
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:22,999
He has a fiancee. As his brother, you
should have stopped him, not supported.

432
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:24,999
Stepmother.

433
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:26,868
What's your ulterior motive?

434
00:38:26,868 --> 00:38:34,267
Do you want him to break off his
engagement and lose favor with Father?

435
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:41,634
You don't, right?
I believe you don't.

436
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:44,999
Then fire her.

437
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:47,400
Jae Jun is head
over heels for her.

438
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,100
Father will be in complete shock if
his father finds out he sees such a girl.

439
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,999
That's not what
you want, is it?

440
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:00,334
I can't do that.

441
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:01,868
You can't?
Why?

442
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:05,999
She's the focus of
attention due to this incident.

443
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:09,000
If she's fired in this situation,
it'll do no good to the company.

444
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,999
And regarding his marriage, why
don't you trust him and leave the matter...

445
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:16,999
Trust and leave the matter?
So what happened?

446
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:20,901
Did you forget what happened
in New York 10 years ago?

447
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:25,999
We left the matter to you and
what became of your wedding?

448
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:30,999
Your bride didn't show up and
brought disgrace to the family.

449
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:34,100
You didn't forget it, did you?

450
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,999
Both your discernment
is worth that much.

451
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:43,901
Fire her unless you want
to bring dishonor to your father.

452
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,300
Tada!

453
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,601
He prepared a lot!

454
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,999
Rest for a beat,
rest for two...

455
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:08,999
Rest for another,
One, two, three, four!

456
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,667
He's old-fashioned like us.

457
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:46,000
The person you have
dialed is not available...

458
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:31,067
That fool!

459
00:41:36,868 --> 00:41:40,300
Wasn't it hard today?
My family was so demanding.

460
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,367
No, I enjoyed it.

461
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:47,267
Now I see why you are
cheerful and warm-hearted.

462
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:52,999
Caring for each other sincerely,
that's a true family.

463
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:56,999
We're not well off,
but we're rich at heart.

464
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:59,067
I really envy that.

465
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:02,999
I'm determined
in what I want to do.

466
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:06,167
What you want to do?
What is it?

467
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:10,234
I'll tell you at
the beach as I promised.

468
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:12,200
Let's go to the sea
next week.

469
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,067
Okay. I will tell my family.

470
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,999
Just kidding.

471
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:23,367
Let's promise this.

472
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:29,701
Whatever may happen,
let's trust each other to the end.

473
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:32,999
I'll promise.

474
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,634
Promise.

475
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,100
Look at the sky!

476
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:10,734
It's beautiful.

477
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:28,834
How's your feeling after
losing Jae Jun to someone else?

478
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:29,999
Well.

479
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:34,934
Just 'Well'? Aren't you eaten
up with fierce jealousy?

480
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:37,534
No, I like it.

481
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:45,467
I thought he was a boring ascetic,
but he has a heart capable to love.

482
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:47,999
I got interested in him.

483
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:49,999
That's good.

484
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:53,601
I don't know what
to make of men.

485
00:43:53,601 --> 00:44:00,934
I knew they are foolish but how could
they fall for girls with poor backgrounds?

486
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:01,999
I know.

487
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:08,334
You see in the dramas, a rich
guy falls for a shocking poor girl...

488
00:44:08,334 --> 00:44:15,133
...and the girl gets hit
or money from his parents.

489
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:19,567
'You'll marry her
over my dead body!'

490
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:23,701
What is it?
That mentality of men.

491
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:30,999
What mentality? You shouldn't
be materialistic like that.

492
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:33,999
To men, there's something
more important than money.

493
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:37,968
More important than
money? Like what?

494
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:41,400
Protective instinct.

495
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,534
Nope!

496
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:48,901
To men, appearance
counts the most.

497
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:56,999
Was that why
you chose me?

498
00:44:56,999 --> 00:45:00,999
What are you talking about?
You know I'm unique.

499
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:07,000
I chose you for money.

500
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:11,601
I'm going to work!

501
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:14,999
Come here!
One, two, three!

502
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:19,167
He's too frank.

503
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:26,300
Mom, so he married you for
money. What about you?

504
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,067
Curious?

505
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:31,999
I married him for one thing.

506
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:32,999
Money?

507
00:45:33,968 --> 00:45:35,999
I was ten times
more rich than him.

508
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:38,999
Then his look?

509
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:41,999
Are you going to upset me
from the morning?

510
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:43,999
Then what is it?

511
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:48,999
It's some garlic bread hot
from the oven. Eat some.

512
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,234
I can barely
swallow this.

513
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:54,734
I'm so nervous.

514
00:45:54,734 --> 00:45:58,534
Articles on me are decreasing,
but there's no response.

515
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,999
I know.

516
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:07,934
You were quite an issue before,
but it's so quiet this time.

517
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:15,400
I thought the public wanted to be
impressed, but maybe I was wrong.

518
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:19,999
Why don't you go back?
There's no other place like TNC.

519
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:21,999
I can't.

520
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:26,999
I made a scene that I won't go back.
It's embarrassing before Mr. Park.

521
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:32,701
Why?

522
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:34,999
It's unlike you.

523
00:46:34,999 --> 00:46:37,999
You choose substance
over your pride.

524
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:44,033
Are you interested in him?

525
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:47,999
Look, he's a married man.

526
00:46:47,999 --> 00:46:49,999
I detest a married man.

527
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:52,400
So he's okay
other than that?

528
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,999
Please stop.

529
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:59,534
Go back to TNC.
That's the best way for now.

530
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:12,234
Take it.

531
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:14,467
It's yours anyway.

532
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:17,999
Our relationship
ends like this,

533
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:20,999
...but since that ring
brings happiness,

534
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:23,534
...I wish you
a good relationship.

535
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:30,767
You can come back if you want anytime.
I'll leave your position vacant.

536
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:41,133
Should I call him
to see how he's doing?

537
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,999
Right, there's no need to worry
about my pride before him?

538
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:50,999
I have no personal
feelings for him anyways.

539
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:03,734
The person you have dialed...

540
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:16,300
The person you have
dialed is not available...

541
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,999
We cannot live!
We want the CEO to resign now!

542
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:29,434
Resign now! Resign now!

543
00:48:29,434 --> 00:48:32,999
We want Park Min Jun
to resign now!

544
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:34,999
Resign now! Resign now!

545
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:37,267
They are in a meeting.
They'll find a solution.

546
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,999
Stop.

547
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:43,234
Mr. Park, you shouldn't
come here.

548
00:48:43,234 --> 00:48:47,100
Let's go to the conference room.
I'll explain everything.

549
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:51,999
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

550

The person you have
dialed is not available.

551
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:20,901
What's going on?

552
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:37,934
I heard you calmed store owners
and sent them away.

553
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:38,999
Yes.

554
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:42,400
We have a lot of problems.

555
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,234
The customers' response to the
Spicy Chicken Pizza is not good.

556
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:47,999
I was reported.

557
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:52,234
It tastes different from sampling.
What's the reason?

558
00:49:52,234 --> 00:49:56,968
We followed Ms. Jeong's recipe,
but it doesn't taste the same.

559
00:49:57,868 --> 00:50:03,968
Then bring her right now.
That's the only way.

560
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:05,999
Father, she's
already resigned.

561
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:09,100
Doesn't matter.
Just bring her.

562
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:14,234
She has to take responsibility
for the problem she caused.

563
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:15,999
You want me to call her?

564
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:18,801
No. I'll do it.

565
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:23,067
Bring her in even if
you have to drag her.

566
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:27,999
She's the only one to get us
out of this crisis, so bring her.

567

[5 missed calls

Go ahead.
Their coffee is good.

569
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:11,300
This is the restaurant
you were going to find me a job.

570
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,999
Our situations are reversed now.
I might have to work here.

571
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:21,999
That's why I came.
I was surprised to find you gone.

572
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:27,801
It's only right to be punished
for what you've done wrong.

573
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:31,534
Can't you come back?

574
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,067
It feels so empty without you.

575
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:40,501
Mr. Park alone is busy looking for
solutions and he looks exhausted.

576
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:47,200
Please come back.
Everything is messed up.

577
00:51:47,701 --> 00:51:49,999
Please come back and help.

578
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:52,999
Did he send you?

579
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:58,667
No. Though no one says,
everybody feels the same way.

580
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:02,834
And I miss you so much.

581
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:07,400
Without you,
I have no one to rely on.

582
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:14,999
Do you still rely on me
after all that I've done to you?

583
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:21,834
Yes. I still like you.

584
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:31,033
You shouldn't like people easily.

585
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:34,501
Please help.

586
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:43,901
Sorry, I'm not accustomed
to physical contact.

587
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:52,999
Alright, Since I caused the
problem, I'll think about it.

588
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:54,999
Ms. Jeong!

589
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:57,767
Sorry.

Will I end up back there?

593
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,999
Yes. For now,
TNC is the best option.

594
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:47,868
This is Rena.

595
00:53:47,868 --> 00:53:49,634
Yes. I was waiting
for your call.

596
00:53:49,634 --> 00:53:51,400
What was your
call regarding?

597
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,601
Let's meet and talk.

598
00:53:53,601 --> 00:53:58,234
Okay. I too have
something to tell you.

599
00:53:58,999 --> 00:54:03,834
Since you're busy,
I'll visit you at your office.

600
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:05,601
I'll be waiting.

601
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,601
Like a brigand.

602
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:38,968
Yes, this is Rena.

603
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:41,999
Now?

604
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:44,999
One day guest?

605
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:50,300
It's for Healing Recipe,
a real hit these days.

606
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,000
I know. The famous
Jeong Hiyeon is the host.

607
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:57,999
The appointed guest
can't show up.

608
00:54:57,999 --> 00:55:00,999
Can you make it tomorrow?

609
00:55:00,999 --> 00:55:04,934
Of course. If you let me,
I can do anything.

610
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:08,234
Come to my office
tomorrow by 10.

611
00:55:13,834 --> 00:55:18,999
By the way,
why did you call me again?

612
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:24,467
I'm just wondering.
You clearly said...

613
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:28,999
...no one's interested in a manager
who quit the company in disgrace...

614
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:33,067
...and I'm only a middle-aged
woman if without a title.

615
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:39,434
And I've got another tag
on top of them.

616
00:55:39,434 --> 00:55:42,999
A recipe thief.

617
00:55:56,901 --> 00:56:01,267
I know you're smart,
but don't try petty tricks with me.

618
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:07,999
You think I don't know that
you put on a show for this?

619
00:56:07,999 --> 00:56:10,534
Since the manager job
didn't appeal to you,

620
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,334
and you were fired from broadcasting,
that's why you're trying to make news.

621
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:17,767
A touching story you confess
your fault to the whole nation.

622
00:56:17,767 --> 00:56:22,400
Not bad.
I like that side of you.

623
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,999
It didn't create a great sensation,
but saved your face.

624
00:56:27,999 --> 00:56:31,734
I'll put you on the air
and see the response.

625
00:56:31,734 --> 00:56:35,999
If you survive this time,
you'll do well on your next.

626
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:47,634
Oh, Mr. Park.

627
00:57:20,334 --> 00:57:22,999
Let me fill your glass.

628
00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:31,999
I thought you wouldn't come.

629
00:57:31,999 --> 00:57:36,999
Why wouldn't I?
I'm sorry I was so late.

630
00:57:38,067 --> 00:57:42,400
Seems you've really hit
hard times. You became gaunt.

631
00:57:44,067 --> 00:57:47,968
How have you been?

632
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:55,999
I dreamt every night that
I go to work when I can't go back.

633
00:57:57,601 --> 00:58:02,067
After a such a hard time,
I've just got a job.

634
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:04,999
I appear on TV tomorrow.

635
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:09,801
I think this is
the last chance for me.

636
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:15,734
If things go well, I may be forgiven
by the public and gain my footing.

637
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:19,767
I will stake my everything
and do my best.

638
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:25,868
That's good.
I'm sure you'll do a good job.

639
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:31,868
Oh. You have something
to tell me. What is it?

640
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:37,999
Nothing.

641
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:40,834
I was just wondering
if you were doing okay.

642
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:42,999
Oh.

643
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:48,999
Didn't you say you too
have something to tell me?

644
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:50,234
Pardon?

645
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:57,567
Oh. I'm sorry I couldn't
help you in times of trouble.

646
00:58:59,834 --> 00:59:01,667
I'll accept your heart.

647
00:59:01,999 --> 00:59:05,067
I'll be cheering you on
from afar so do well.

648
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:08,767
Sure. I'll do a good job.

649
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:14,999
I think I should go now.

650
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:20,999
I have a lot to prepare
for the recording tomorrow.

651
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:25,400
Well, take care.

652
00:59:58,033 --> 01:00:00,200
One moment, I need to buy clothes.

653
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,634
It's time to close.

654
01:00:02,634 --> 01:00:04,367
I'll buy the
most expensive one.

655
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,999
I have to wear it tomorrow
so give me a little time.

656
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:09,434
Then take a look around.

657
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,999
Please eat some.

658
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:44,999
What the...!

659
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:10,999
Jeong Hiyeon?

660
01:02:14,033 --> 01:02:14,999
Hello.

661
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:17,999
Hey, Hiyeon.
Look great.

662
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:21,999
Today you have
a new guest.

663
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:23,000
Who?

664
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,999
You know
Chef Rena Jeong.

665
01:02:25,999 --> 01:02:27,434
-Rena Jeong?
-Yes.

666
01:02:27,434 --> 01:02:28,999
I don't know her.

667
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:30,767
Oh, you don't?

668
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:38,999
How are you?

669
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,100
What is this?

670
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,634
Excuse me?

671
01:02:55,267 --> 01:02:57,501
Take it off.

672
01:02:57,999 --> 01:03:00,999
Take it off now!

673
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:08,999
What's wrong with you?

674
01:03:08,999 --> 01:03:29,467

675
01:03:35,999 --> 01:03:37,767
Let's do it brightly,
pleasantly.

676
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:40,300
Yeah, make my day.
I'll never lose again.

677
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,999
Stop suffocating me
and just leave me alone!

678
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:44,667
What? Suffocating you?

679
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:46,467
I'll get rid of her
out of your sight.

680
01:03:46,467 --> 01:03:48,999
I didn't know you were
this terrible person.

681
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:50,901
You're really going too far.

682
01:03:50,901 --> 01:03:54,434
If you want the Qingdao hospital, you two
build it and live happily ever after!

683
01:03:54,434 --> 01:03:55,676
I'll refuse it!

684
01:03:55,701 --> 01:03:58,601
Get out. I'm sick to death
of incompetents.

685
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:01,999
Now it's really over.
It's all over.
