1
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:56,973
All right.

2
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,184
Okay. Come on, now.

3
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,811
Come on, boy.

4
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,400
Let's not take your sweet-ass time
about this. Jesus.

5
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,194
All right.

6
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,821
Okay, that's it.

7
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,825
Ah, good.

8
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,287
Don't laugh, I outlived you,
you little bastard.

9
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,005
Goddamn it. Son-of-a-bitch.

10
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,352
Breakfast of champions.

11
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,369
You trying to tell me Sammy Davis Jr.
was better looking than Robert Redford?

12
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,579
No question.

13
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,789
Better actor too.

14
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,501
Sammy should've been
the Sundance Kid.

15
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,836
Ah. You're out of your mind.

16
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,546
No, they're right.

17
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,133
Sammy only had one eye,
but he cut quite a figure.

18
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,055
I know what you're doing.

19
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,391
You're trying to piss me off,
but it's not gonna work. Not this time.

20
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,481
Strike.

21
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,291
You boys enjoy the fishing,
I'll see you up in the Carolinas.

22
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,711
Where you going, Gus?
Aren't you gonna see what he's got?

23
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,005
I've seen all this guy's got.

24
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,175
My daughter can throw better than that.

25
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,927
Good luck.

26
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,890
NEIL
Mickey, it's time.

27
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,101
Yep.

28
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,897
- They're ready for you, Miss Lobel.
Thank you.

29
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,950
Hard to believe it's been seven years.

30
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,787
Time flies when you're
working your ass off.

31
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,249
Excuse me, doing your life's work.

32
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,336
So where do you stand
on the Landau case?

33
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,798
- I like my chances.
- That could be quite a coup for us.

34
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,634
It's all very impressive.

35
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,636
Thank you.

36
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,431
You'd be the youngest partner
this firm's ever had.

37
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,518
There is a reason I've not taken a Saturday
off in seven years. I want this. Bad.

38
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,147
So does Todd.
He's been productive for a long time.

39
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,733
He's a quality associate.

40
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,610
But I have been more productive.

41
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,654
And I agree with you,
he is a quality associate.

42
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,490
You'd be the only woman.

43
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,661
Gentlemen,
my father is a baseball scout.

44
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:10,291
And while he was hardly attentive, the one
thing he did give me was experience.

45
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,126
I took a lot of road trips.

46
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,879
I grew up around men who swore,
drank, and farted.

47
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,257
Trust me, I can handle it.

48
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,301
Let us bring it
to the partnership committee.

49
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,595
- Then we'll talk.
- Great.

50
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,349
Hudson, a 17-game winner last year...

51
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,725
Order up!

52
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,104
You need some money
for some new clothes?

53
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,649
I just came from yoga.

54
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,401
You into that voodoo, huh?

55
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:42,281
Yeah. I'm thinking about getting three sixes
tattooed across my forehead.

56
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,494
- What about the partnership?
- We're close.

57
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:50,706
There's just some competition from
another attorney, but he's harmless.

58
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,291
You got a boyfriend?

59
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,086
I'm seeing somebody, sort of.

60
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,506
And has he got a job?

61
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,633
He's an attorney.

62
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,555
Well, marry him.
He'll probably be a great provider.

63
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,517
I can provide for myselfjust fine.

64
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,646
Hudson, he's really painting
the corners tonight.

65
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,066
Guy's a true artist.

66
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,903
I'm gonna go.

67
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,739
- What?
- I'm going to go.

68
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,658
You haven't finished your dinner yet.

69
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,535
Oh, I've had enough.

70
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,578
Suit yourself.

71
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:36,377
Absolutely tremendous. Prescott
just went three-for-three again last night.

72
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,838
Didn't he just get arrested for assault?

73
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,423
Allegedly.

74
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,967
Kid's hitting 350,
ready to move to Double A.

75
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,594
So let's not rush to judgment.

76
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,596
You seen him play lately?

77
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,682
I don't need to see him play.

78
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,227
You and that computer. Heh.

79
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,855
Need to stay current, Pete.

80
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,191
These programs are an essential tool
to evaluating today's talent.

81
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,153
In fact, there's only one scout
in the entire organization...

82
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,614
...maybe in all of baseball,
that doesn't use this technology.

83
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,702
Maybe that's why he's only signed
three kids in what, last four years?

84
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,705
This isn't like a store.
You can't just go in and get what you want.

85
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,208
Maybe there's nothing out there.
Maybe his territory's a little thin.

86
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,420
What about Billy Clark in Rome?
Didn't Gus sign him?

87
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,715
Heh, yeah, and he's struggling.
Kid's in a big-time slump.

88
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,635
He'll come around.
Gus could spot talent from an airplane.

89
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,473
I just hope we're not missing anything,
that's all.

90
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,974
I mean, he is getting up there.

91
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,394
Should we send him to look at Gentry?

92
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,773
Of course. The Carolinas are his territory.

93
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,900
Draft's in nine days.

94
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,486
I don't want any surprises.

95
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,655
You're talking about one of the best scouts
baseball's ever seen.

96
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,076
You're talking about the guy that signed
Ralph Garr, Dusty Baker...

97
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,703
...Dale Murphy, Tom Glavine,
Chipper Jones.

98
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,246
The list goes on.

99
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,417
With all due respect, Pete,
the game's changed.

100
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,462
It's so much bigger now. It's global.

101
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,798
Need somebody to keep up with the times.

102
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,884
Gus couldn't even turn on a typewriter,
let alone a computer.

103
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:13,349
Look, we all hate to think it,
but he may be ready for pasture.

104
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,813
- When's his contract up?
Three months.

105
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,190
We carry the option.

106
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:26,362
For chrissakes, what is this?
Gus Lobel can do the job.

107
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,948
If he proves me wrong,
I'll take full responsibility.

108
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:33,119
Until then, let's just worry
about the guys on the field.

109
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,332
Shit.

110
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,211
Bunch of goddamn midgets
design this garage?

111
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,811
Come on, number five.
Strike him out, boy.

112
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,564
Billy Clark ain't got nothing on you, baby.

113
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,401
That Billy Clark is a bum.
We haven't seen him hit a baseball all year.

114
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,699
Come on, Billy.

115
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,832
Here it comes, Billy.
Here it comes, baby. Go, baby.

116
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,510
And that'll do it, with the final score:

117
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,096
Intimidators 5, Braves 2.

118
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,682
Better luck next time, boys.

119
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,778
How long before they release me?

120
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,281
You're just in a slump. No big deal.

121
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,490
I'm in a coma.

122
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,286
Yeah. Look, when I first signed you up,
you were hitting great.

123
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,788
You were the quickest bat alive.

124
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,084
I don't know what my problem is.
I just can't concentrate like I should.

125
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,463
What about your family?
They still over in Akron?

126
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,132
- Yeah. Just outside.
- Mm-hm.

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,635
When was the last time you saw them?

128
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,346
It's been a while.

129
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,933
They would make the drive down, but,
uh, money's just kind of tight right now.

130
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,476
You worry about baseball.

131
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:23,562
I'll take care of getting your parents here
so you can see them.

132
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,314
No problem.

133
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,816
Thanks, Gus.

134
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,330
Gus, you home?

135
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,207
Oh.

136
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,669
It's 9:00 in the morning,
where the hell else would I be?

137
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,504
I guess that means I can come in.

138
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,506
Yeah, come on in.

139
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,009
Breakfast will be here in a minute.

140
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,178
Have a seat.

141
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,555
Busy?

142
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,850
Yeah. Just doing my homework, that's all.

143
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,484
Gus, did you ever think in a million years
computers would be a part of this game?

144
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,860
Computers?

145
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,865
Anybody uses computers doesn't know
a damn thing about this game.

146
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,369
If you wanted to, you could access
any high school or college roster...

147
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,871
...pull the stats on any player any time.

148
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,666
You wouldn't have to waste time
with all these papers.

149
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,627
I'm not wasting my time.
I enjoy doing this.

150
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,715
You know, they got a special program now
that can calculate a player's stats...

151
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,842
...and based on the competition he's seen...

152
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,304
...tell you whether or not he's ready
for the next level. You believe that?

153
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,682
Yeah, what else does it tell you?
When to scratch your ass?

154
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,229
I don't like them either,
but they're part of the business now.

155
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:52,234
Pete, scouts, good scouts,
are the heart of this game.

156
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:57,489
They decide who's gonna play, if they're
lucky they decide how it's gonna be played.

157
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,243
But a computer, that can't tell
if a kid's got instincts or not...

158
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,997
...or if he can hit a cut-off man,
or hit behind the runner.

159
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,750
Or look into a kid's face
that's just gone oh-for-four...

160
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,587
...and know if he's gonna be able
to come back like nothing's happened.

161
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:15,591
No, a computer can't tell you
all that crap, I'll tell you. No.

162
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,594
What do you think about Bo Gentry?

163
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,097
I don't know.
He looks pretty good on paper.

164
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,184
I'll take a look at him, see if he can play.

165
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,103
If the Red Sox pass with their first pick...

166
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,439
...I know Phillip really wants to take him.

167
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,648
Phillip.

168
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,612
Well, tell him to check his computer.
What we need is a pitcher.

169
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,280
Yeah.

170
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,450
Maybe, uh, he can find one on his interweb.
Heh.

171
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,204
Spotlight's really on this kid.

172
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,041
Well, there's breakfast.

173
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,298
Morning, Mr. Lobel.

174
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,635
Got your Canadian bacon,
extra anchovies, chili peppers.

175
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,971
- Wow, that's a work of art, Danny.
- Yeah, it's gross.

176
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,433
- And I got your newspapers.
- Oh, thanks.

177
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,643
Right here.

178
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,603
- There you go.
- Thank you.

179
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,855
- Keep that.
- Uh...

180
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,108
Mr. Lobel, did you mean to give me 50?

181
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,447
No, no, I was just... I was just testing you.
Heh.

182
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,657
Here.

183
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,244
Here's a 20 for the pizza
and keep the five for yourself.

184
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,957
Some new kind of style I'm not up on?

185
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,836
That's Fang-shmay.
Don't you know anything?

186
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,348
Ah.

187
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,100
What you looking at?

188
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,686
Gus, are you all right?

189
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,354
Yeah, fine.

190
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,733
We go back. If something were wrong,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

191
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:57,943
Course.

192
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,198
Because if for any reason,
you're not up to it...

193
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,826
...we could send somebody
from Charlotte.

194
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,120
Might be easier on you.

195
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,038
I don't need easier.

196
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,043
Have you thought about what you might do
when your contract's up?

197
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,589
Sure. Sign another one for more money.

198
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,468
You ever think about retirement?

199
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,972
What's this all about?

200
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,225
There's just a lot of pressure right now.

201
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:35,063
Phillip has Vince's ear. Pumping him full
of ideas. Telling him we need new blood.

202
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,066
Young new blood.

203
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:43,071
Yeah. Phillip doesn't have a lick of sense,
they're gonna find that out sooner or later.

204
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,033
- They're worried about Billy Clark.
- Don't worry about Billy.

205
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,744
He can hit. He just needs
to see his mama, that's all.

206
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:53,081
In fact, I put in some paperwork already
to have his folks come down and see him.

207
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,833
I can't do that.

208
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,251
You want him to hit?

209
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,753
Do it.

210
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,672
You know the game better than most...

211
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,551
...and I'll always go to bat for you.
I just want to make sure you're up for it.

212
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,846
Want something to eat?

213
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,099
How's Mickey?

214
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,435
Good.

215
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,523
Good. They're gonna make her a partner
in her firm, at least she thinks.

216
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,611
Tell her I said hey.

217
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,779
Yeah.

218
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,062
Richard.
No, I'm not.

219
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,106
Yeah, he tagged you.
Come on, guys.

220
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,150
All right, look out. A-Rod's up.

221
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,653
This'll be an easy out, guys. Easy out.

222
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,738
Oh, really? Then who are you gonna be?

223
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,157
Josh Beckett.
I'm gonna throw at your A-Rod head.

224
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,660
- We'll see about that.
Outfielders, move in.

225
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,000
Hey, batter, batter.
Hey, batter, batter.

226
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,168
Beckett winds and delivers.

227
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,339
He comes with a nasty slider
that A-Rod just barely gets a piece of.

228
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,302
A- Rod's in the type of slump he couldn't hit
the beach with a beach ball.

229
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,679
Here comes the oh-one.

230
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,016
A- Rod lines a shot to center.

231
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,476
The outfielder can't make the play.

232
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,606
The ball goes under his glove,
rolling all the way to the wall.

233
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,985
He's rounding third, gonna try to make it
home. Here comes the throw at the plate.

234
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:49,323
Safe! Safe! He beat the tag!
The Yankees win the game!

235
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,536
I do not believe it!
The Yankees win the game!

236
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,416
What a weirdo.

237
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,210
- Yeah, okay.
Dork.

238
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,379
It'd help if you wouldn't fidget.

239
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,384
Well, if I wasn't blind, I would be after
having that light stuck in my eye.

240
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,845
You see anything in there,
other than open space?

241
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,472
I'm afraid I do.

242
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:18,810
I'm not sure, but, uh, there are indications
of macular degeneration...

243
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,062
...or maybe glaucoma.

244
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,563
Or maybe nothing.

245
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:26,068
Well, let's find out. We'll, uh, get you
an appointment with a specialist.

246
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,986
No, no. No appointments.

247
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,990
- I haven't got time. I've got the season.
- Well, you better make time.

248
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,327
Look, Lloyd, let's just pretend
I wasn't even in here.

249
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,705
Oh, God.

250
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,628
Blues with a feeling
That's what I have

251
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,171
How's it going, Gus?

252
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,591
Crap, Jimmy. Absolute crap.

253
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,804
- How about a game of Keno, Gus?
- I don't think so.

254
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,098
- Come on, one game.
- I said, I don't think so.

255
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,767
That means no, goddamn it.

256
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,770
Okay, okay. What crawled up your ass?

257
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,022
Old age.

258
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,782
I just want to see where this goes.

259
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,367
So do I.

260
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,910
Then step up.

261
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,413
Can we agree on being exclusive?

262
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,415
See what happens.

263
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,126
Just see where it goes.

264
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,631
Mickey, I don't mean to be pushy, but...

265
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,633
...we're perfect together.

266
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,262
Friends, lawyers.

267
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,474
If you look at it on paper,
it makes perfect sense.

268
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,893
I mean, a no-hitter.
Jurrjens was awesome.

269
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,187
Couldn't have
without that catch by Heyward.

270
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:48,442
Excuse me. Did you just say Jair Jurrjens
pitched a no-hitter?

271
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,403
Walked one, or would have had
a perfect game. Blowing people away.

272
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,988
I doubt that.

273
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,489
I'm sorry?

274
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,659
He's a sinker-ball guy.

275
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,246
He's crafty, makes his living
on the corners.

276
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,459
Wow.

277
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,003
You're quite a baseball fan.

278
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,881
Just picked up a few things growing up.

279
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,517
FEMALE VOICE
You have one new message.

280
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,853
ROSENBLOOM
Mickey, it's Daniel Rosenbloom.

281
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,855
We've spoken with
the partnership committee.

282
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,690
You win the Landau case...

283
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,486
...I think we'll be holding a big reception
to introduce you as the firm's new partner.

284
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,155
Yes!

285
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,298
Who the hell is calling me up
at this time of night?

286
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,677
Hello?

287
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,730
The undersigned hereby substitutes
Georgia Reconveyance Company...

288
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,023
NEIL
Mickey?

289
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,151
- What?
- You have a visitor.

290
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,573
Pete.

291
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,660
Can we talk for a second?

292
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,999
Have you noticed anything lately?
Has he been acting any differently?

293
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,127
No, he is as unpleasant as usual.

294
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,380
He been sick at all?

295
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,756
I don't think so.

296
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,970
Mick, if something goes wrong
up in Carolina with this kid Gentry...

297
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,555
...he's gonna be out of a job.

298
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,515
Well, let's hope that doesn't happen.

299
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,768
That would be the end
of one of the all-time great love stories.

300
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:51,439
- He wouldn't do well without his work.
- What do you want me to do about it?

301
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,527
Carolina's beautiful this time of year.

302
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,783
No. No way.
He has his life, I have my life.

303
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,786
That is the way it's always been.
That's the way he wants it.

304
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,914
Just for a couple of days.
To make sure everything goes okay.

305
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,792
It'd be nice for you two
to spend some time together.

306
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,502
Nice for who?

307
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,963
If you won't do it for him, do it for me.

308
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,633
He's my friend for 30 years.
I care about him.

309
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:24,139
Don't try to manipulate me.
I'm an attorney, that's my job.

310
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,977
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm really busy right now.

311
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,859
I appreciate your time, Mickey.
I just thought you should know.

312
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,669
Yeah.

313
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,798
I'm sorry about not being
around here lately.

314
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,718
But I been working a lot and...

315
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,721
Your little girl...

316
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,974
...you'd really be proud of her.

317
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:13,897
She's gonna be made a partner in the firm.
How about that?

318
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,235
I don't know where she got the brains.
It's got to be from you.

319
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:24,199
It wasn't from my part of the family,
that's for sure.

320
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,787
Anyway, I need you around to talk to her.

321
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,623
You were always good at that.

322
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,545
I have a hard time with that, you know?

323
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,387
You are my sunshine

324
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,890
My only sunshine

325
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,727
You make me happy

326
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,730
When skies are gray

327
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,734
You'll never know dear

328
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,197
How much I love you

329
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,910
Please

330
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,416
Don't take your sunshine away

331
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:43,862
Cut the crap, Lloyd.

332
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,072
I'm his daughter.

333
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,241
Then he can tell you.

334
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,078
Please?

335
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:58,001
His eyes are going.
He needs to see a specialist right away.

336
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,970
Who is it?

337
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,974
If this is a robbery,
just take anything you want.

338
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,479
But leave that flat-screen.
You take my flat-screen, I'll kill you.

339
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,440
Did you set off a bomb in here?

340
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,653
It's raining, for chrissake.

341
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,907
Yeah, outside it's raining.
In here it's like a four-alarm blaze.

342
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,536
Oh.

343
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,748
Look, twice in one week.
What, did somebody die or something?

344
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,708
Pete came to see me.

345
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,420
Did you hear that Jurrjens, uh,
pitched a no-no?

346
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,465
He wanted to know
if I thought you were okay.

347
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:46,925
Yeah.

348
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,470
I know you're a vegan and everything,
but some of this meat would re...

349
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:54,015
Yeah, I told him that I thought so,
but I called Lloyd just to make sure.

350
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,936
That's a good burger.

351
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,191
What are you doing?
No, no. Don't do that. Don't do that, no.

352
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,651
This is really nice.

353
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,361
Nice stuff.

354
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,531
Do you want to talk about it?

355
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:16,162
You know how these doctors are,
they don't know their right from their left.

356
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,373
You're always reading in the paper...

357
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,709
...about how they're taking off
the wrong part of some poor guy.

358
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,004
You need to meet with a specialist.

359
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,383
I've got a job to do,
and if I don't do that job...

360
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,844
...the Braves will get somebody else
to do it.

361
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,973
You know, they already think
I should be playing Bingo...

362
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,726
- ... and drinking little umbrella drinks.
- They can't fire you over an illness.

363
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,147
Yeah, well, they can certainly phase me out.

364
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,316
I've only got three months left
on my contract.

365
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,736
Well, how are you gonna scout this guy
if your eyes aren't right?

366
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,489
I'll figure something.

367
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,449
How?

368
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,577
You hungry?

369
00:24:56,287 --> 00:25:00,373
You know, every good chef says that
you got to eat a meal when it's warm.

370
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,042
You know, I had this, uh...

371
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,922
This crazy idea you and I could actually
have a conversation about this, rationally.

372
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,593
Well, we are. If you eat some meat,
it's great protein for you.

373
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,761
How about that?

374
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,560
Well, don't worry about it.

375
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,688
I wish it were that easy, I really do.

376
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,107
That would be awesome.

377
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,540
Trust me, it's there.

378
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,295
Article 15, section 2A
clearly states the precedent.

379
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,964
Yeah, find it. Check the public record.

380
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,133
Get back to me. Thank you.

381
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,386
Do you work while you sleep too?

382
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,473
When I have to.

383
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,393
That's one good thing about not having
any family. You can focus on work.

384
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:07,732
I have a family, and they're none
of your goddamn business.

385
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,235
Excuse me.

386
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,611
After you.

387
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,904
Cheers, Todd.

388
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,113
Cheers.

389
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, I hope you're enjoying the trip,
sweetheart.

390
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:31,172
We're just entering the beautiful state
of North Carolina.

391
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,481
Do you need an extra key?

392
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,400
No, just one, thanks.

393
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,777
Don't even think about it.

394
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,281
- Room 4 is vacant. Do your homework.
- Yes, ma'am.

395
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,659
Sorry. Last room on the end.

396
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,786
Okay. Thank you.

397
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,711
I wish Daddy was here.
I do too.

398
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,882
Thanks.

399
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,677
Come on, baby.

400
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,113
I understand, Mickey.
And I fully support what you're doing.

401
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:41,784
I'm just questioning the timing. There's
so much to do before the presentation.

402
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:46,080
And I will get it done, okay?
You can count on me. It's just a few days.

403
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,634
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen...

404
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,429
...and welcome
to Swannanoa Grizzlies Baseball.

405
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,558
This afternoon,
the Grizzlies host the Fairview Raptors.

406
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,101
Hey, guys.

407
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,644
I think that's him.

408
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,898
How many years they gonna hold
him back? He looks like he's 30.

409
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,152
First thing I do when I get in the Majors...

410
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,488
...is bang one of those chicks
on Desperate Housewives.

411
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,033
I'm mature, I like older women.

412
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,160
But what if they don't want to bang you?

413
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,039
Wilson, that's a retarded question.

414
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,793
I'll have patience with you
since you're not yet worldly.

415
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,797
See, when a player gets to the Majors,
chicks come out of a deep freeze.

416
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,965
They migrate from hundreds of miles.

417
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:42,136
Celebrity chicks, non-celebrity chicks,
chicks from all walks of life.

418
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,346
It's a chick-fest.

419
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,142
Hey, yo, Peanut Boy! Over here.

420
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:57,985
Two dollars, please.

421
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,239
You want me to pay for them?

422
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,993
It's all right, Peanut Boy.
Put it on my tab.

423
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:26,681
Strike three!

424
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,350
And that retires the side.

425
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,853
The Grizzlies are coming up.

426
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,703
Wow.

427
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,044
Hey, there, kiddo.
- Been a while. Hey.

428
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,174
You mind?

429
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,259
The hell are you doing here?

430
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,805
I had some vacation days. Couldn't think
of a better place to use them.

431
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,224
Well, they have telephones.
You could call.

432
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,684
Yeah. You would've said no.

433
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:15,897
Damn right, I would've.
You should be back home, doing your job.

434
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,024
Same as I'm doing my job here.

435
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,193
If it makes you feel better,
I'm doing it for Pete.

436
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,028
He thought you could use
some company.

437
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:23,905
Yeah, well, he's wrong.

438
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,324
Wait'll I see that horse's ass.

439
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:31,287
It must be so rewarding
being one of your close friends.

440
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:32,997
Hmm.

441
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,877
And now batting
for the Grizzlies, number three, Bo Gentry.

442
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,339
Yeah, way to go, Big B! Go Bo!

443
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,843
Let's see what everybody's
been talking about.

444
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,689
That's the way to do it, boy! Hustle! Hustle!

445
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,111
Safe.
That's it.

446
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,917
Ball four! Take your base!

447
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,752
This guy sucks!

448
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,712
Now batting for the Grizzlies...

449
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,465
...number three, Bo Gentry.

450
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,135
Let's go, Big Bo. Number three!

451
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,013
You're in trouble now, Bacon Boy!

452
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,436
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

453
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,648
But if that guy calls me Bacon Boy
one more time, I'm gonna kick his ass.

454
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,358
All right, listen to me.

455
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,319
I want you to walk Gentry.
Don't give him anything to hit.

456
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,074
Walk him? Have you seen the way
I've been throwing today, coach?

457
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:54,161
- I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
- All right, son. Stick with it.

458
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,081
Better put some grease on it, Bacon Boy!

459
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:02,336
Oh, yeah? Too bad I used all my grease
last night on your mother.

460
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,505
Ooh!

461
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,800
- Douche bag.
- Come on. Play ball.

462
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,176
Let's go, Big B.

463
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,529
That's what I mean, boy!

464
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,533
Yeah! Yeah! That's my boy! Ha, ha.

465
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,497
Bring it on in! Bring it on in!

466
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,166
Bring it on in!

467
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,262
Y'all make a hole, make a hole now.

468
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,432
We're not talking till after the playoffs.
Nope, I'm sorry.

469
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,561
If you want an autographed picture of Bo,
he signs before every game.

470
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:04,732
It's a bargain, 25 bucks a pop.

471
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,067
Autographs?

472
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,652
You've been gone a while.

473
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,111
I guess so.

474
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,623
What happened here?

475
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,626
My garage is starting to shrink.

476
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,586
- I think I'll drive.
- No.

477
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:26,837
Dad, give me the keys.

478
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,923
This is my car and I drive.

479
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,383
Give me the keys.

480
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,093
I said, I'll drive.

481
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,433
Stubborn as hell.

482
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,310
Yeah, I wonder where I get it.

483
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,563
I want you to drive
straight to the airport...

484
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,692
...because I don't need your pointy
little nose in my business.

485
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,946
I don't want anything to do with your
business. I'm here because you're so pig...

486
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,406
Gus Lobel.

487
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,034
Wow, it's good to see you, man.

488
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,869
It's Johnny.

489
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,207
Johnny? Oh, Johnny.
Johnny The Flame Flanagan?

490
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,000
Nobody's called me that in a while.

491
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,628
Yeah, well, you used to throw
the cover off the ball.

492
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,796
Phew. I used to.

493
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,589
What are you doing, boy?

494
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,968
I'm here, uh, doing the same thing you are.
I'm scouting for the Red Sox.

495
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:17,054
- You don't know anything about scouting.
- Don't tell them that.

496
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,641
Yeah. This is my daughter, Mickey.

497
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,102
Excuse us.

498
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,855
Sorry. Hi. I'm Mickey.

499
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,815
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

500
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,987
- Okay. You gonna be at Boots Bar later?
- Where else?

501
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,948
- I'm buying you a drink.
- I'm taking it.

502
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,450
Okay.

503
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,077
- A great pitcher at one time, that kid.
- Wow.

504
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,287
Yeah.

505
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,789
- When are you gonna leave?
- Just get in the car.

506
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,673
Cold beer on Friday night
A pair ofjeans that fit just right

507
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,343
He can do it all.
He's more versatile than De Niro.

508
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,345
What?

509
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,931
Ice Cube isn't an actor.

510
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,184
He's in the movies, ain't he?

511
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,227
That doesn't mean he's an actor.

512
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,355
Gus, what do they call the actors
in the movies?

513
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,523
Actors.

514
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,944
Plus, he can rap. Can De Niro rap?

515
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,362
Actors don't rap.

516
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,364
Ice Cube does. Heh.

517
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,367
See, this is what I'm trying to teach you
about versatility.

518
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:24,538
It's a crime he hasn't won
an Academy Award.

519
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:29,210
That's true. Pretty soon he'll be joining
the greats like Cagney and Tracy.

520
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,544
All the real big ones.

521
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,213
I'm with you there, brother.

522
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,049
All right. You did it.

523
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,218
You pissed me off.

524
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,557
Hi, guys.

525
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,229
Hey, it's been a long time
since we've seen your little girl, Gus.

526
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,398
Been a long time
since she was a little girl.

527
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,569
The hell are you doing here?

528
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,113
I'm taking a temporary break
from anything judicial.

529
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,908
I just need a big drink
and a game of pool.

530
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,910
You shouldn't be in a place like this.

531
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,996
You used to sneak me
into places worse than this.

532
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,415
You should be back in Atlanta,
where you belong.

533
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,459
Yeah, well, I agree with you.

534
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,545
Hey, Johnny!

535
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,713
Why do they call him "The Flame"?

536
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,424
Well, Flanagan, he...

537
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:21,095
He could pitch a hundred-mile-an-hour
fastball, that's why.

538
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,557
- So, what happened?
- He blew his arm out.

539
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,101
They tried to bring him along too fast.

540
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,895
Pretty soon, he was gone. Done for.

541
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,773
I tried like mad to block that trade.

542
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,944
How long you gonna be here anyway?

543
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,030
I'll probably close the place down.

544
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,456
Hey.
- Hey.

545
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,251
Name's Rick.
You, uh, feel like playing a game?

546
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,297
- Sure. Mickey.
- Nice to meet you, Mickey.

547
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,923
Hope you like losing.

548
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,553
Ouch.

549
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,640
Three-ball, corner pocket.

550
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,773
One-ball, side pocket.

551
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,003
Thanks for the game.

552
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,008
Hey, you wanna dance?

553
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,635
Not really.

554
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,845
Come on, one dance.

555
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,597
I don't think so, Dick.

556
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,183
- Heh. It's Rick.
- Sorry.

557
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,185
Come on, one dance.
It wouldn't hurt anything.

558
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,854
And I mean, after the beating I just took,
you owe me.

559
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,439
- Get off!
- Dad!

560
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,779
You ever touch her again,
I'm gonna rip your fucking face off.

561
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,489
Whoa, Gus.
- Dad, take it easy.

562
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:04,782
Just look at this kid.

563
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,201
- All right, all right.
- I saw you touching her.

564
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,703
Get out before I have
a heart attack trying to kill you.

565
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,330
I think I'd like to see that.

566
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:15,584
Enough! Hey, you know what,
this is my dad and, uh, that's my sister.

567
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:19,129
And, uh, we like to get a little crazy
every now and then, especially this one.

568
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,132
Go on, get out of here.

569
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,225
- That was a little excessive.
- I don't think so.

570
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,687
- You want to kill a guy touches my arm?
- I had him, you know?

571
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,356
Yeah, no, you had him good.
You had him good.

572
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,234
Sorry about the kiss.
I never had a sister that looked like you.

573
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,904
You know what?
I can take care of myselfjust fine.

574
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,157
- Okay. Something tells me pretty well too.
- You know what?

575
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,244
You got what you wanted.

576
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,579
I'm going to bed.

577
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:58,919
Leaving the bar.

578
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,761
To set the record straight,
I am 33 years old.

579
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,473
I've been taking care of myself
for a long time. I can handle a guy in a bar.

580
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:12,766
He was bothering me.

581
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,062
All of these years, after everything
you could be bothered about, it's that.

582
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,940
Look, I don't need your help.
I don't know why you're here.

583
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,942
I don't know why you don't go home.

584
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:27,448
Because, in spite of you, I feel this
dysfunctional sense of responsibility...

585
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,199
...to make sure that you're okay.

586
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:34,121
I know I'm as blind as a slab of concrete,
but I'm not helpless.

587
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,875
- I'll put a bullet in my head, that happens.
- That's comforting.

588
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,090
As always, it's been really great
talking to you.

589
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:48,052
I've got half a beer back at the bar
that won't argue with me.

590
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:52,473
- You all right, Gus?
- Yeah.

591
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:13,994
Jesus Christ!

592
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,245
Goddamn it!

593
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,083
Son of a bitch.

594
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,870
Oh! Ha, ha.

595
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,039
Oh, my God.
All right, check it.

596
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,918
Your mom is so fat,
her high school photo was an aerial shot.

597
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:06,004
Your mom is so fat,
they pay her in biscuits.

598
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,548
- Your mom is so...
- Excuse me?

599
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,884
Earth to losers?

600
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,054
I'm trying to do my visualizing.

601
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:18,058
I'm hitting homers, I'm signing
endorsement deals, I'm banging chicks.

602
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,227
Respect my space.

603
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:23,313
All right, all right, that's enough, okay?
Everybody, sit down.

604
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,731
Back in your seat, Eric.

605
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,943
This is a big game today.
Let's think baseball, huh?

606
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,533
Let's tighten it up, Grizzlies.

607
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,743
One, two, three, Grizzlies!

608
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,415
No room for bad play. Don't suck today.

609
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:52,968
There they are.

610
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,386
Here he comes.

611
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,096
- Hey, Gus.
- Hi.

612
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,265
Hey, Mickey.
Look at you.

613
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,104
Hey, Dad!
Dad, Dad, Dad, are you all right?

614
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,607
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Here, come on.

615
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,775
You okay?

616
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,944
Yeah, leave me alone. I got it.

617
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:15,115
What's the matter,
you never seen anybody trip before?

618
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,911
Jesus Christ.

619
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,623
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

620
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,416
Thank you.

621
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,043
Hey, listen. About last night...

622
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,920
It's... Forget it.

623
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,630
Yeah.

624
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,257
Play ball!

625
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,765
I'll be right back.

626
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,475
Where you going?

627
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,644
Third base side.

628
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,314
- What for?
- Because I'd like to get back to Atlanta.

629
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,443
Oh, good. As long as you're here,
you might as well be helpful.

630
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,154
- Watch his hips.
- Yeah, I know.

631
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,615
Make sure they carry him through the ball.

632
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,033
Yeah. I know.

633
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:01,995
Okay, and his swing, is it a two-piece deal
or is it nice and fluid?

634
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,916
And then go around the other side
and see how he goes the opposite way.

635
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,755
Now don't just stand there, get going.

636
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,184
Ball!

637
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,567
Oh, yeah, this is a good idea.

638
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,987
Why are you right next to me?

639
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,657
Because you're the first scout
I've ever been attracted to, thank God.

640
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,909
I'm not a scout, I'm a lawyer.

641
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,913
Normally, a deal breaker, but I'm all about
expanding my level of tolerance.

642
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,873
Self-improvement, et cetera.

643
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,542
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

644
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,043
Next up, Bo Gentry.

645
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,005
Go, Big 3!

646
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,383
- Hey, what do you think about dinner?
- You mean together?

647
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,720
Whoa, that's a little forward,
don't you think?

648
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,973
But, yeah, if you're asking me out,
I accept.

649
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,725
I'd even consider paying.

650
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,101
Strike!

651
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,896
Well, it's really tempting, but I don't plan
on being around here much longer.

652
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,815
Let's go, Bo!

653
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,567
Bring the heat.

654
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,903
He'll be all over the heat.
Come with the off-speed stuff.

655
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,536
Yeah!

656
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,414
That's it, boy! Take them bases, man!

657
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,500
That's the fourth car this year. Ha-ha-ha.

658
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,715
Gus must have a lot of confidence in you.

659
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,091
So, what'd you see?

660
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,011
He sits back on the pitch.

661
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,305
He uses his hips and legs for power.

662
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:47,059
Looks like he has pretty quick hands.
You're on your own.

663
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,770
You know too much about baseball
to be a lawyer.

664
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,438
It's a long story.

665
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:52,773
I'd like to hear it.

666
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,233
I don't wanna tell it.

667
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,618
Go, Bo!

668
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,955
Come on, Big Bo.

669
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,792
There you go, buddy.

670
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,795
That popped. Fastball.

671
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,255
Hanging.

672
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,967
How would you know with your face
buried in that?

673
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,096
It's called multitasking.

674
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,308
You are such an ass.

675
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,147
That thing hear you?

676
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,151
His name is Todd and he will,
loud and clear.

677
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,451
There you go, baby.

678
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,995
Breaking ball on that one.

679
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,372
Yep.

680
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,183
Ready?

681
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,027
Why don't you show me what you got?

682
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,366
Hmm.

683
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,331
Come on, you stubborn mule.
Give me something.

684
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,835
I'm a little old for this.

685
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,044
I'm not.

686
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,880
Remember:

687
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,217
- See the ball...
- "See the ball, hit the ball. " I know.

688
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,559
Whoo!

689
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,149
What the hell are you doing?

690
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,943
I'm enjoying my home run trot.

691
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,405
Whoo!

692
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,922
You snake. I'll kick your ass.

693
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,132
Give me the keys.

694
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,718
Come on, you're busy.
Give me the keys.

695
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,596
Give me the keys.

696
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,000
Hey! You all right?

697
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,922
You know, you're lucky to be alive.

698
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,425
How old are you, sonny?

699
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,927
I'm 28.

700
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,806
Well, then how the hell would you know
if I'm lucky to be alive?

701
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,810
I know, it'll get done.
It's just a couple more days.

702
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:21,898
Mickey, I'm sorry about your father,
but the client will be here next Thursday.

703
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,151
- It's imperative that you're here to present.
And I will be there.

704
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,947
I'm considering bringing Todd
into the case, just till you get back.

705
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,782
No, I'm not comfortable with that.

706
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,452
He is a talented attorney.

707
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,498
No, but I don't need his help.
Please, just hold off.

708
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,501
I gotta go.

709
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,673
Well, I guess we were lucky
we weren't on the road at the time.

710
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:51,845
She was 13 years old
and she was going to her first dance...

711
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:55,765
...and she came in the room
and asked me what I thought of her outfit.

712
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,687
I knew right then that she wasn't
gonna be a kid any longer.

713
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,025
How old was Mickey when, uh...?

714
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:08,028
Her mother died? Six.

715
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,781
That should've been me.

716
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,035
No kid should be without a mother.

717
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,790
How did you handle all that by yourself?

718
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,377
I didn't.

719
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:29,799
How about you, Flanagan?

720
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,678
Don't you feel like you're over your head,
handling a number one pick?

721
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,057
I've been doing okay so far.

722
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,851
Besides, you're here. I'll be fine.

723
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,396
This isn't exactly what you wanted to do,
is it?

724
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:53,907
After my arm went, the Red Sox gave me a
chance to, uh, you know, stay in the game.

725
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,411
There's gonna be a job in the booth
next year, and I'm gunning for it.

726
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,913
Announcing, huh?

727
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:02,624
Yes, Gus.

728
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,127
I plan on bringing all that hard work
and dedication I had as an athlete...

729
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,088
...to my profession as a broadcaster.

730
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,888
Ever think what would've happened
if the Braves hadn't traded you?

731
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,103
No more than eight, nine hours a day.

732
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,147
Yeah.

733
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,442
Never goes away, does it?

734
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,737
No, it doesn't.

735
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,749
God Almighty, Gus.

736
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,459
What happened?

737
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,212
Cut myself shaving.

738
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,215
What are you fellas staring at?

739
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,134
I'm not a pole dancer.

740
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,187
What you doing with hot dogs?

741
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,148
I couldn't hold out any longer.

742
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,691
One of those for me?

743
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,025
Nope.

744
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,340
Good job, Bo.

745
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,975
Yeah, there's one more game.
We'll watch it and then make our decision.

746
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:47,395
- You think the Sox are gonna pass?
- How the hell should I know?

747
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,689
Try and get a sense
of what they're gonna do.

748
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,816
I'll get that, Mom.

749
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,277
Yeah, I'll see what I can do on that.

750
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:57,197
Dad, I'm starving.

751
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,533
I gotta hang up now. Mickey and I
are gonna get something to eat.

752
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,619
She still there?

753
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,663
Yeah, she's here.
She's just, you know, sightseeing.

754
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,344
He's a monster.

755
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,513
Three for three, two homers and a single.

756
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,307
We could be looking
at the next Albert Pujols.

757
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,227
Oh, my God, I want this pick.

758
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:31,189
Maybe the Red Sox are on the fence,
we do a draft and trade deal.

759
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:34,192
Just make sure Grandpa
doesn't screw it up, all right?

760
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,821
- He's got some young babe with him.
- Wow.

761
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,907
I'm surprised he can still get it up.

762
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:44,244
- All right, keep me posted.
- You got it.

763
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,040
It was Mississippi.

764
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,459
No, I know it was Mobile, Alabama.

765
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:55,463
They had one of those promotion nights
where they had a horse out on the field.

766
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:58,925
They had one of the players
race the horse around the bags.

767
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,885
That's right, and the player won.

768
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,263
You almost gave me a heart attack.

769
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,430
How?

770
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,934
Well, you kept pestering me
about getting up on the horse.

771
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,728
And the horse ran off,
right out over center field.

772
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,940
I thought it was gonna go through
the center field fence.

773
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,150
I loved that horse.

774
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,902
Yeah, I know you did.

775
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:23,116
And then you went back looking for him
and he wasn't there.

776
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:26,995
What? What is it?

777
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:31,624
Nothing.
It was just a long time ago, that's all.

778
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,751
- Here, I got it.
- No, I got it.

779
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,129
Dad, I've got it.
Let me help, that's why I'm here.

780
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:37,964
No, I got it!

781
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,641
Night.

782
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,493
- Hey, Greg.
Mickey.

783
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:11,164
If it wasn't for your assistant, I wouldn't
have known you were out of town.

784
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:16,628
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I meant to call you,
I just had a lot going on up here.

785
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:23,843
I just want you to know
I've been thinking about us...

786
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:28,431
...and I am really clear that I want this
to go to the next level.

787
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,185
So, basically, I just need to know
that you're feeling the same way.

788
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,688
Greg, I can't answer that right now.

789
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,149
That's the problem.

790
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:41,110
It doesn't feel like you can ever
give me an answer.

791
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:46,324
This isn't one of those things
that you can just put on paper.

792
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,788
Well, I guess that's my answer.

793
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,999
You, uh...

794
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,709
You take care, Mickey.

795
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,022
You could buy me a drink if you want.

796
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:23,903
You have got to lighten up.

797
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,155
Seriously.

798
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:29,575
I don't feel so light right now.

799
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,661
Get out.
- What?

800
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,246
Go.

801
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:36,666
Why don't you two go out,
meet some people? Have some fun.

802
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,459
You don't want to hang around here.

803
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:42,380
- Thank you. I meet plenty of people.
- Well, you're still single, aren't you?

804
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:46,676
- Yes, I'm still single, very single.
- Maybe you are emotionally unavailable.

805
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:49,554
Emotionally unavailable?

806
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,222
- Yeah.
- Who are you, Dr. Phil?

807
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,016
Hey, that is quality television.

808
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,225
Yeah.

809
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,519
By the way,
if I am emotionally unavailable...

810
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,772
...which I am not, thank you very much,
it would be because of you.

811
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,190
Just go, will you?

812
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,400
- No.
Jesus Christ.

813
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,986
We gotta get a camera crew
to follow you guys around.

814
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:08,614
I mean, the Kardashians
have nothing on the two of you.

815
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,199
Wow, that poor Bruce.

816
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,617
Come on. Will you, please?

817
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:14,954
Just the two of you, get out.

818
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,970
Okay.
Okay.

819
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,513
Name a team...

820
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:36,893
...to have four 20-game winners
in the same season. Go.

821
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,063
'71 Orioles: Palmer, McNally...

822
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,316
...Cuellar and Dobson, they lose
to the Pirates in the series. Go figure.

823
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,902
Ugh! You've got to be kidding me.

824
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,321
- Have you had enough?
- Mm-mm.

825
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:51,032
No, no, no. Fire away. Come on.

826
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,450
Okay, uh, '75 World Series...

827
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:56,329
...Carlton Fisk hits a homer
to win the game, right?

828
00:56:56,497 --> 00:57:01,084
What was the player who hit a homer to tie
the game and take it into extra innings?

829
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,919
Ugh.

830
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:04,128
The three-two pitch.

831
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:07,298
This one's hit deep to center, way back.

832
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,676
Way back.
This baby's got a chance. It's gone.

833
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,471
Home run.
Bernie Carbo has just tied the game.

834
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,682
Bernie Carbo has just tied the game.

835
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,185
- Very good.
- All right, that's... Yeah.

836
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,355
You're actually very good.

837
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:25,566
You're really very good.
You sound like the real thing.

838
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:28,653
- Let's hope the Red Sox agree with you.
- I would listen to you.

839
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:29,946
- Really?
- Really.

840
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,825
Who's the only player to be named
MVP in both leagues?

841
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:38,204
Frank Robinson.
Baltimore and Cincinnati.

842
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,455
That was too easy.

843
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,125
- It was really, really easy, actually.
- Shit.

844
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,918
Mm.

845
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,711
Who was he traded for?

846
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:49,257
Milt Pappas, but if we're going to be
specific, Baldschun and Simpson.

847
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,466
Drink up.

848
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,135
Who are you?

849
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:57,557
- I see what's happening here.
- I'm kicking your ass is what's happening.

850
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,476
Well, maybe.

851
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,729
I mean, you're trying to get me drunk.
You're hoping to get lucky.

852
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,898
Really? Heh.

853
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,409
Um...

854
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,786
Too much moonshine?
What are they doing?

855
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:19,996
Clogging.

856
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,373
- Clogging?
- Clogging. Clogging.

857
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,251
- It's a mountain dance. No?
- No.

858
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,795
Where I'm from, they'd take you
to a psych ward for that.

859
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,589
No, actually, it's a...

860
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,840
I think you'd like it.

861
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,384
It's really fun. You should try it.

862
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:34,886
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yes.

863
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,929
- No.
- Come on, it's fun. It's really fun.

864
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,764
- No.
- It's really fun. Come on.

865
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,350
I'll deny this ever happened.

866
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,728
Just try to keep up.

867
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,906
Hop up and down, they'll think
you know what you're doing.

868
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,282
Okay.

869
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,371
I think we're going in a circle.

870
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,082
Oh, yeah!

871
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:10,213
You're good at this. I don't believe you,
I think you clog all the time.

872
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,594
Just keep bouncing, just bounce.

873
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:19,472
I think I got it now. I got it.

874
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:29,190
Yeah, it was, uh,
my first start after being called up.

875
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,069
God. There's nothing like it.

876
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,071
I mean, it's Fenway.

877
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,741
As I'm walking out to the mound,
all I could think about was...

878
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,577
...all the legends that had played
there before, you know?

879
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,954
How'd you do?

880
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,665
Went six and a third, three earned.

881
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,583
First start, that's awesome.

882
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,919
Well, that's the best it got.

883
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,922
We needed middle relief help.

884
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,465
So they used me...

885
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,300
...a lot.

886
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,719
My arm got tired...

887
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:00,513
...didn't say anything.

888
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:02,765
Ended up tearing my rotator.

889
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,309
That was it. What are you gonna do?

890
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,645
Why didn't you say anything?

891
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:13,192
Because I was afraid if I did,
they'd find somebody else.

892
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,445
I'm sorry.

893
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,784
So, what's Mickey short for? Michelle?

894
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,161
Heh. Mickey is short for Mickey.

895
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,580
As in Mickey Mantle,
my father's favorite player.

896
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,457
Aha.

897
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,252
Lucky it wasn't Yogi Berra.

898
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:35,673
Shit, I'm sorry.

899
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,759
Jealous boyfriend?

900
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:40,594
No, this thing is all work, no play.

901
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:44,682
There's no available space
for jealous boyfriends.

902
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,062
You want to tell me
what's wrong with Gus?

903
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,398
You can trust me.

904
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,150
Okay?

905
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,029
When Gus scouted me,
we spent a lot of time together.

906
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:02,742
To be honest, when I got traded, I think
it bothered him as much as it did me.

907
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:08,372
Actually, I remember him saying
he had a daughter in college.

908
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,249
Yep.

909
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:14,295
He would say that she was smarter
than me and him put together.

910
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:19,216
That's why when I met you, obviously,
I thought Gus had another daughter.

911
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,513
Doesn't sound like my father.
That sounds like a compliment.

912
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,182
Well, he said it.

913
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,517
Well, he never tells me anything.

914
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,894
Maybe he wants to.

915
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:33,689
You know? Doesn't know how.
You might have to take the lead.

916
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,525
Trust me, I've tried. I'm done.

917
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,528
As you know...

918
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:44,450
...to hit the magical 300,
you fail seven out of ten times.

919
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,246
You think you're pretty smart.

920
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,332
- Me? No.
- Yeah, you.

921
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:56,295
- What, that a good thing? You like smart?
- Well, you gotta have it here, and here.

922
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,588
Here and here?

923
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,465
Yes, here and here.

924
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,135
Oh, yeah. I'm pretty much
what you're looking for then.

925
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,436
I come home early in the evening

926
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:15,106
Lie around some time

927
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:20,486
Little girl's got everything I want

928
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:23,989
Looking and smelling so fine

929
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,910
It's a good night for dancing.

930
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:30,830
Yeah. Heh.

931
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,999
Yeah, we've done some dancing. Heh.
If you can call it that.

932
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,543
Don't be shy.

933
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,755
Ahem. Well, you heard the man.

934
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,508
Make a move on me.

935
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,469
Okay, come on. Come on.

936
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,985
I'm so sorry.
I'm having a good time, but...

937
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:04,572
- What's wrong?
- It's this thing, I just...

938
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,282
I need to go.

939
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,994
Wow. You were not kidding.

940
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:11,996
You really have no available space.

941
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:14,957
Is all this by design?

942
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:18,544
It is way too late
to get into that right now.

943
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:21,964
Yeah, okay.

944
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,049
I'll take you home.

945
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,401
You trying to starve me to death?

946
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,446
Come on, let's go get something to eat.

947
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,033
You got a man in there?

948
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:53,746
Yeah, Flanagan's in here.
We're getting ready to get in the shower.

949
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,294
Not so funny.

950
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:05,799
What the hell happened in here,
anyway?

951
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,009
Work.

952
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:14,099
Okay. There you go. You're good.

953
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,769
You kids all right?

954
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:19,021
Yeah. Just fine.

955
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,026
You wouldn't happen to know what
the state bird of New Jersey is, would you?

956
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:28,614
That'd be a trick question.
There are no birds in New Jersey.

957
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,201
That's good.

958
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,375
You're leaving a lot of good food
unattended there.

959
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,967
Do you know what, um, therapy is?

960
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:50,886
What?

961
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,389
Therapy.

962
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:59,186
I've been going since college.
It's a long time.

963
01:05:01,273 --> 01:05:05,818
Just needed to talk to someone
to help me deal with why you left me.

964
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,904
Did I say something wrong here?

965
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:16,036
I just needed to, um, understand
why after mom died...

966
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:20,874
...you took a 6-year-old to live
with an uncle that she barely knew...

967
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:25,671
...and you left her there for a year
and you didn't even call, not once.

968
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:30,634
We came here to watch baseball.
We didn't come here to...

969
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,553
Talk. I know.

970
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,931
Everything is okay
as long as we don't talk.

971
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,976
But there's no TV
and there's no game on, so...

972
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,688
- It's just you and me.
- I need a check here.

973
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,356
And then you did it again.

974
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:48,360
I had you until I was 13,
until you sent me away to boarding school.

975
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:49,778
And then nothing.

976
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,405
You were gone.

977
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,533
Middle school, high school,
college, nothing.

978
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,536
For a long time,
I thought I had done something wrong...

979
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,997
...and that's why you left.

980
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:03,959
But then I figured out that's how
you wanted it, so I acted like it was okay...

981
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:07,046
...because I didn't want you
to know how bad it hurt.

982
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,548
This is not the time or place
to talk about this.

983
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,425
Are you kidding?

984
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,886
There's never a time or place.

985
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:17,056
What are you doing, anyway?
Why did you start all this?

986
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,853
You're amazing.

987
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,235
Give me a check.

988
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,823
Get me a goddamn check.

989
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:43,248
So I hear the old man has a girlfriend
in North Carolina, a young one.

990
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,209
What the hell are you talking about?

991
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:48,045
Nelson says he's got a pretty
little baby helping him out.

992
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:50,589
What's Matt Nelson doing
in Gus's territory?

993
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:53,384
They sent him down there.
Make sure everything's all right.

994
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,220
Confirm that Bo Gentry's our choice
if he's available.

995
01:06:58,598 --> 01:06:59,640
Listen.

996
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:04,019
That babe is Gus' daughter
and she's not helping out, she's visiting.

997
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,896
The hell's going on, Pete?

998
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:10,109
Can't have the daughter of one of our scouts
impacting an important Braves decision.

999
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,528
You're a real team player,
aren't you, Phillip?

1000
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,822
It's just business. Don't take it so personal.

1001
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,908
I'm not after your job
because I want director of scouting.

1002
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:22,121
I'm after your job because I want to be
the G.M. You know how it is.

1003
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,873
Get the hell out of my office.

1004
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:40,681
Nice shot.

1005
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:43,434
- Uh, I got the Landau research.
- Oh.

1006
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,646
I agree with Mickey there's precedent,
I don't think it's our strongest position.

1007
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,565
I've outlined my approach a bit different.

1008
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:54,987
I know you have a hard deadline for the
presentation, so I'm here if you need me.

1009
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:56,155
It's priority.

1010
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,866
Why, I appreciate that, Todd.

1011
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,368
It, uh...

1012
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,912
...won't go unnoticed.

1013
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,753
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen...

1014
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,297
...and welcome
to Asheville's Zeb B. Vance Field...

1015
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:17,426
...the site of the Mountain County
Championship game...

1016
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:22,514
...between your Swannanoa Grizzlies
and the Devils of Morganton.

1017
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,103
There you go, darling.

1018
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,192
That'll be a collector's item
so don't go selling that on the Internet.

1019
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,695
It's the two best teams
in the Mountain County League...

1020
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,364
Well, the last game.

1021
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,701
- Hope it's a good one.
- Yep.

1022
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:43,911
Play ball!

1023
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,371
Pack up and get you back to Atlanta.

1024
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:48,957
For sure.

1025
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:59,218
There they are. My two favorite people
in the entire state of North Carolina.

1026
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:02,971
Well, good to see you.

1027
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:06,683
Hey, did you get your work done?

1028
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,311
Some of it.

1029
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,897
Good. I had a nice time.

1030
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,817
Who knew I was such a clogger?

1031
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:23,742
Now batting, number three...

1032
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,495
...Bo Gentry!

1033
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:45,305
Off-speed. Right?

1034
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:50,894
Do you mind getting your beak
out of that thing? I'm blind, you know.

1035
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,231
Got it.

1036
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,493
Did you hear that?

1037
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:07,953
No, what?

1038
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,665
- That was a breaking ball, right?
- Yeah.

1039
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,626
Ha. Son of a bitch. Heh.

1040
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,212
Can't handle a breaking ball.

1041
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,298
How can you tell?

1042
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:22,885
- Did you see a hitch in his swing?
- No.

1043
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:28,515
If you can get down there next time he's up,
I want you to keep an eye on him.

1044
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:31,018
See how he handles that breaking ball.

1045
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:40,903
Come on, now. This is it.
Let's bring this one home to Swannanoa.

1046
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,487
Wilson.

1047
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,952
You better get your skinny little ass
on base.

1048
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,914
I got a chance to win this game
in front of all these scouts.

1049
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:55,417
I'm visualizing mega endorsement deals.

1050
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:57,628
Do not mess this up.

1051
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,465
I'll do my best, Bo.

1052
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,845
Oh, dear God, let me get a hit.

1053
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:11,350
Now batting, number 12, Wyatt Wilson.

1054
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,604
One pitch at a time.

1055
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,859
You got it, Wyatt!

1056
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:24,696
Take your base!

1057
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,658
Come on, ump, what the heck's going on?

1058
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,329
Guess you misunderstood me.

1059
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:36,291
Next up, Bo Gentry!

1060
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:56,061
All right, let's see how
you handle the hook.

1061
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,255
That's my boy! That's right!

1062
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,565
And the Swannanoa Grizzlies...

1063
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:44,735
...are the champions
of the Mountain County League.

1064
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:50,115
Congratulations to both teams
for an exciting and excellent game.

1065
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,955
You were right.

1066
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,790
His hands drift.

1067
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,794
How did you know that
if you can't see him?

1068
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:06,757
Because I've been in this business
too damn long, that's why.

1069
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,426
No, it's more than that. Tell me.

1070
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:13,221
It's the sound you hear.

1071
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:17,559
It's like a ball coming off the bat,
or exploding into a glove.

1072
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:21,188
It's a pure sound.
You'll know it when you hear it.

1073
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,943
MICKEY
So, what do you think?

1074
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:30,197
You make a number of key arguments.
It's provoking.

1075
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:33,116
Well, I'll be back tomorrow afternoon
to present to the client.

1076
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:38,080
Uh, no need to rush back.
Uh, you can take off the rest of the week.

1077
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,623
Excuse me?

1078
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:42,793
Mickey, we didn't know how serious
this was going to be with your father.

1079
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,546
So to ensure the firm's best interests
were protected...

1080
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:49,216
...we had Todd draft a resolution.

1081
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,425
What?

1082
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:54,513
He's gonna take the case from here,
so, look, enjoy a few more days.

1083
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,848
- Come back rested.
Rested?

1084
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:01,520
This isn't a vacation.
I've worked my ass off on this case.

1085
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,522
No one would dispute that.

1086
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,274
You bring boot-licking Todd on
and you don't tell me?

1087
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,319
- Mickey, it's not personal.
- Of course, it's personal.

1088
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:13,698
Todd's just being a team player.
- Yeah, that's being a team player.

1089
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,034
How does this affect my partnership?

1090
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:17,953
To be determined.

1091
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:21,206
A conversation we all want to continue.
You're a quality associate.

1092
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,961
Now I'm a quality associate, I see. Um...

1093
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:30,632
I've worked longer and harder than
anyone in that office. I deserve this.

1094
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:36,680
You'll have your time, Mickey.
Just, uh, maybe not now.

1095
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,685
All right, um...

1096
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:45,897
I will see you all next week,
rested and ready to work.

1097
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,076
It's my problem.

1098
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:02,247
I don't know why I give my blood,
sweat and tears to those cold-blooded...

1099
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,791
...backstabbing jerk-offs.

1100
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,044
And for what?

1101
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:13,341
I guess, you know,
you want your name on the door.

1102
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,596
Hmm.

1103
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:28,398
Where'd you learn how to drink, uh,
fancy single-malt out of the bottle?

1104
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:31,193
- They teach you that at law school?
- No.

1105
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:36,573
My dad. Yet another brilliant gift
he bestowed upon me.

1106
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:47,959
You are my sunshine

1107
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,212
My only sunshine

1108
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:56,468
You make me happy
When skies are gray

1109
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,265
My dad used to sing that when, uh...

1110
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:06,686
When we were low,
and he would sing that and...

1111
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:08,897
...it would help.

1112
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,944
You have his voice.

1113
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,912
What do you think, Flanagan,
about your first pick?

1114
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:28,458
Uh, I don't know. What do you think?

1115
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,002
I just got off the phone with Atlanta.

1116
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,672
We're not gonna take him
because he can't hit a curve.

1117
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,341
The last homer he hit was off a curve.

1118
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,134
Tell him.

1119
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,846
His hands drift.

1120
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,227
He can't get any punch into a breaking ball
because his hands are just drifting.

1121
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:48,770
Well, he still hit it out.

1122
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,690
Sisters of the Blind could hit it out
with an aluminum bat.

1123
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:55,151
From everything the Red Sox
have heard...

1124
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,862
...they think we're drafting
the next Albert Pujols.

1125
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,657
Well, just take my advice
and be careful.

1126
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:05,537
You're sure? Not even as a project?

1127
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:09,207
You'd waste a number one pick
on a project?

1128
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:13,503
If you wanna cover your ass, okay,
but I sure as hell wouldn't do that.

1129
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,965
It's not every day you get
a number one pick.

1130
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:20,343
That's true, but let me give you
another piece of advice.

1131
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,637
Don't be afraid to walk away.

1132
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,806
Go ahead and do what you like,
Flanagan.

1133
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:28,768
If he's available, he's not gonna be playing
for the Braves, I'll tell you that.

1134
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,233
Think he's right?

1135
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,527
I don't know.

1136
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:41,906
What's the matter with you? You okay?

1137
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,535
Yeah. I'm just thinking, a lot, too much.

1138
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,163
- Too much thinking.
- Okay.

1139
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:52,125
That's enough, we're gonna get out of here.
Come on.

1140
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,753
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

1141
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,921
You'll figure it out when we get there.

1142
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:58,840
- Come on.
- Do I need my shoes?

1143
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,884
You can bring them if you want.

1144
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,614
You want something from him...

1145
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:25,784
...that he just may not be able to give you.

1146
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:29,788
So do yourself a favor,
stop being pissed off about it.

1147
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:36,461
What?

1148
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,130
You're not so bad, Flanagan.

1149
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:56,606
Wow.

1150
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:00,735
That's all right. I'll wait.

1151
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,614
How long?

1152
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,661
As long as it takes.

1153
01:19:19,547 --> 01:19:21,047
What are you doing?

1154
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,508
What am I doing?
I'm taking my clothes off.

1155
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:31,433
What?

1156
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,023
Let's go.

1157
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,526
You are crazy.

1158
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,323
Aah! Ha, ha.

1159
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:54,664
You coming in?

1160
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,917
Oh, no. No, no, no, I don't think so. Heh.

1161
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:01,880
Afraid you might forget about your job
for a second and actually have some fun?

1162
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,800
Oh, thank you for the analysis.
How much do I owe you?

1163
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,552
That one was pro bono.

1164
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,721
Oh, thanks.

1165
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:11,514
Come on.

1166
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,224
Live a little.

1167
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,900
No peeking.

1168
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:30,992
What're you staring at?

1169
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,661
The paint job on the car.

1170
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,038
Oh, yeah, you like it?

1171
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:36,748
Really hot paint job.

1172
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,667
- Yeah.
- Really hot.

1173
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,964
What? Oh, uh-oh. Here she goes.

1174
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,257
Whoo!

1175
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,178
Whew.

1176
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:52,931
Wow.

1177
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:55,350
- A cannonball.
- Yeah, you like that?

1178
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:57,519
- Yeah, it's impressive.
- Thank you.

1179
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:01,648
Isn't this beautiful?

1180
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,234
Yeah, it sure is.

1181
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:14,077
Where are you going?

1182
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:17,205
I'm keeping a safe distance.

1183
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,583
You're good at that, you know?

1184
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:22,919
Why don't you try stopping?

1185
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:26,381
Here.

1186
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:31,719
How's this?

1187
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,223
It's safe.

1188
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,726
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1189
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:44,899
What about now?

1190
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:48,069
Safe.

1191
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:19,350
This makes me nervous, Johnny.

1192
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:25,857
Are you sure they're passing?
How well do you know Gus Lobel?

1193
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:28,985
Trust me, we go back a long way.
Okay? He's a friend.

1194
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:30,903
Three minutes to make the pick.

1195
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:33,990
Look, I could play this safe
and tell you to take him.

1196
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:36,868
But you don't want to do that.
The kid's hands drift.

1197
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:40,538
The truth is, I didn't even see it,
Lobel did.

1198
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,707
You better be sure
you understood him correctly.

1199
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,418
I'm sure.

1200
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:47,670
Welcome back to Major League Baseball's...

1201
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:50,214
...live coverage of the first-year player draft.

1202
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,342
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1203
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:56,429
High school, college students from across
the country have worked hard all year...

1204
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:58,598
...and it all comes down to this.

1205
01:22:58,766 --> 01:22:59,891
Here we go.

1206
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:03,311
Okay, so it's time to find out.
Let's head to the podium.

1207
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,855
Oh, my God.

1208
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:08,024
SELIG
Good evening.

1209
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:12,153
With the first selection
of the first year player draft...

1210
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,238
...the Boston Red Sox select...

1211
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:19,494
...Paulino Estrada, a right-handed pitcher
from Arizona State University.

1212
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,287
Yes! Come on, baby.

1213
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:23,539
Gentry's ours, Red Sox pass!

1214
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:26,834
The Atlanta Braves have
the next pick and they are now on the clock.

1215
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,044
Congratulations.

1216
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:31,255
The Red Sox. So stupid.

1217
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:36,052
The Sox passed
because Flanagan's smart, that's why.

1218
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,098
Like I told you last night,
kid can't hit a curve ball.

1219
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,434
You know how I feel about you,
but God Almighty, if you're wrong...

1220
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:47,814
Well, I'm not wrong.
Kid's nothing but a dead-red hitter.

1221
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:51,359
Oh, you can watch him if you want
and see if he develops...

1222
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:52,902
...but no more than that.

1223
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,030
I'll see you back in Atlanta in a few days.

1224
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:02,912
Don't sign him.

1225
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:06,457
- What?
- Gus is adamant. He can't hit the curve.

1226
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:11,003
Oh, Christ! How long?
How long are we gonna listen to this?

1227
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:13,631
I don't give a damn.
We've been tracking him.

1228
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,175
Matt says he can hit the crap
out of anything.

1229
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:17,427
This kid's a godsend.

1230
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:21,139
- Pete?
- I stand with Gus.

1231
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,099
I say sign the pitcher from San Diego.

1232
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,017
We are not passing on him, Vince.

1233
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,979
Last time I checked, that's my decision.

1234
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,315
Yes. No, I'm sorry. It's just...

1235
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,985
I've been following this kid...

1236
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:37,238
- ... every game, every single at bat.
Your computer's followed him.

1237
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:40,992
When's the last time you stepped out
of the office and saw a high school game?

1238
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,453
Our pick's up in two minutes.

1239
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:47,790
If I am wrong, if I'm wrong, you fire me.

1240
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:49,667
But I am telling you right now:

1241
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:54,005
Bo Gentry's the kind of five-tool player that
changes the entire landscape of a franchise.

1242
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:58,217
We draft this kid and we are competitive
for the next five, 10 years.

1243
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,149
Sorry, Pete.

1244
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,200
- You better be right.
- I'm right.

1245
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:24,285
Definitely right.

1246
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:39,133
Did it even occur to you
that I might get fired?

1247
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:41,135
- You just don't care.
- What happened?

1248
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:42,845
That's funny. Learn to walk away?

1249
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:45,848
Isn't that what you said?
Yeah, well, I did. I walked away.

1250
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:48,851
I passed and you guys got Gentry.
Congratulations.

1251
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:50,228
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1252
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:53,981
You did the right thing, Flanagan. I guess
the Braves don't give a crap what I think.

1253
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,399
Honestly, Gus, save it.

1254
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:57,401
Whoa, hold on. Johnny, it wasn't us.

1255
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:58,820
- Really?
- Really. It wasn't.

1256
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:02,073
- It's the truth.
- The truth? Oh, okay.

1257
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:04,200
Well, the truth is, it's over for me.

1258
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:07,787
I had a real shot at the booth,
and now it's gone.

1259
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:10,581
Okay, well, that wasn't us.

1260
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:14,919
You can drop the act, Mickey,
I feel dumb enough already, okay?

1261
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,796
You know, I should've known better.

1262
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:20,216
A lawyer and a washed-up baseball player.

1263
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:24,428
Look, you have to believe me. Last night
meant more to me than you know.

1264
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,013
Get out of the way, Mickey.

1265
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:31,561
This is a bad time to walk away now.

1266
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:33,604
Move.

1267
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:35,690
No.

1268
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:37,733
Move!

1269
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:41,612
Let him go.

1270
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:07,889
Well...

1271
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:13,144
...I guess now I go into a life of retirement
for all the good service I've given them.

1272
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,355
Always use another watch.

1273
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:19,066
I should've seen it earlier.

1274
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,027
No, it wasn't your fault.

1275
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:26,198
Phillip Sanderson sent that guy up here
to make sure I didn't screw it all up.

1276
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:28,826
Well, things are definitely screwed up.

1277
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,288
So, what do we do now?

1278
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:33,873
Go home.

1279
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:39,337
Me, to a career ending, and you to
a career that's just starting as a partner.

1280
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:41,839
I don't think so.

1281
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:43,925
What?

1282
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:47,470
It was more important
that I be here. It's, I...

1283
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:49,138
- No.
- No, it's all right.

1284
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:51,432
- No.
- No, I'll deal with it.

1285
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,642
No.

1286
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:56,520
God, I worked my ass off
so you could have more, and you...

1287
01:27:56,688 --> 01:28:00,191
You're gonna throw it away
on coming to a garbage can like this?

1288
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:02,777
- That's no life for a...
- For a girl.

1289
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,528
That's no life for a kid of mine.

1290
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:09,617
Living out of suitcases and visiting
every shit-ball town in the area.

1291
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,453
That's not what I wanted for my kid.

1292
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:15,039
Well, I guess what I wanted didn't matter.

1293
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:19,710
- You don't even like baseball.
- I love baseball.

1294
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,129
You know I love it.
I never wanted to be a lawyer.

1295
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,882
I did that for you so that you
would be happy with me...

1296
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:28,719
...and that you would approve of me
and then maybe you'd keep me around.

1297
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:33,432
I did what I felt was right.

1298
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,143
I just didn't want you to have life
in the cheap seats.

1299
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,270
They weren't the cheap seats.

1300
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:41,691
Spending every waking moment
with my dad watching baseball...

1301
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,985
...eating food that was no good for me.

1302
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:47,738
Playing pool, staying up too late,
those were the best seats in the house...

1303
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,615
...until you sent me away.

1304
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:52,910
Well, I was just doing the best I know how.

1305
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:54,745
Only a coward leaves their kid.

1306
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:58,416
You don't know half
of what you think you do.

1307
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,794
Okay, then tell me the other half.

1308
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:04,422
Goddamn it, Dad, talk to me.

1309
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:08,759
Dad...

1310
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,845
...talk to me.

1311
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:13,681
Please.

1312
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:28,320
You remember years ago,
down in Mobile, Alabama...

1313
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:30,614
...they had the horse
running around the field.

1314
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:31,824
Yeah.

1315
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:36,537
They used to keep that horse in a trailer
down outside the bullpen gate.

1316
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:41,375
Anyway, I was talking to this kid
I had signed...

1317
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:45,629
...telling him there's no place for him
in the big leagues.

1318
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:49,800
And all of a sudden I realized
you were gone and I couldn't find you.

1319
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:50,968
I was panicking.

1320
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:53,804
I saw this shack there.

1321
01:29:58,852 --> 01:29:59,894
I went...

1322
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:02,563
I went over and looked in...

1323
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:06,484
...and there you were with this guy.

1324
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,320
He had his hand
down the back of your shirt.

1325
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,156
I don't remember that.

1326
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,910
Yeah. How could you?
You were only 6 years old.

1327
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:23,042
I sent you out, and then I started
beating the shit out of this guy.

1328
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:28,172
I smashed his head against the wall and
I started hitting him with everything I had.

1329
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,052
I strangled his ass.

1330
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,513
Finally, he passed out.

1331
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:38,641
Oh, my gosh, Dad.

1332
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:43,354
I kept waiting for the police to come
and arrest me, but they never did.

1333
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:47,942
That's when I sent you to your aunt and
uncle's. I thought they'd take care of you.

1334
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:50,694
I thought I'd failed you.

1335
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,489
Your mother had died a year before
and I was a mess.

1336
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:56,117
You have to understand that.

1337
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,872
Can't you understand that you
sending me away wasn't protecting me...

1338
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,207
...it was rejecting me.

1339
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:09,213
I've been working hard to not let anyone
else get close enough to do that again.

1340
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:11,382
And being alone really sucks.

1341
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,011
Well...

1342
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:22,184
...you might just have to give me
a little slack on that, because...

1343
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:24,353
...I just can't change.

1344
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,357
You never tried.

1345
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:39,910
I'm just a broken-down old man.

1346
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:48,335
And you ought to get as far away
from me as you can.

1347
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:51,505
Can't you just do that?

1348
01:31:57,888 --> 01:31:58,929
Yeah.

1349
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,266
I can do that.

1350
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:30,461
Grace?

1351
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:32,796
Do you know where he is?

1352
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,966
Oh, he left. Checked out early this morning.

1353
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:39,887
Thanks.

1354
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:42,723
MICKEY
Is he all right?

1355
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:45,226
He said he wanted to take the bus.

1356
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,395
What happened with you two?

1357
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:50,648
Nothing.

1358
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:53,984
It's all good.

1359
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,195
Thanks, Pete.

1360
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:43,260
I gotta stop.

1361
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:48,932
Hi. I'm Mickey.

1362
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,060
I've been watching,
it's really impressive.

1363
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:52,728
Thank you.

1364
01:34:52,896 --> 01:34:55,105
You're welcome. Mind if I try?

1365
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:00,110
I can handle it, I think.

1366
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,447
Are you crazy?

1367
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,450
Probably.

1368
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:08,077
Can I borrow your glove?

1369
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,963
- Throw me that fastball.
Okay.

1370
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:28,555
Is that your favorite pitch?

1371
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,266
Sorry?

1372
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:34,103
Can you throw a curve?

1373
01:35:35,105 --> 01:35:36,146
Yes.

1374
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:39,358
- Show me.
- Okay.

1375
01:35:57,544 --> 01:35:58,585
Oh, my God.

1376
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:00,587
Do it again.

1377
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:17,354
What's your name?

1378
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:20,065
Rigoberto. They call me Rigo.

1379
01:36:20,233 --> 01:36:21,942
Rigo. You play in school, Rigo?

1380
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:24,862
No, ma'am. Never had the grades
to suit my mom.

1381
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,947
Kept getting B's in Chemistry.

1382
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:31,034
Well, thank God for Chemistry.
You gonna be around here for a bit?

1383
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,661
Yes, ma'am.

1384
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:35,706
Okay. Wait here, all right?

1385
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:40,085
Mickey, I just can't do it.
This isn't an open tryout.

1386
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:43,714
I've seen him.
I swear to you, he's the real thing.

1387
01:36:43,882 --> 01:36:45,340
There's no paperwork on the kid.

1388
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:49,219
I just can't parade him out on the field
and let him pitch.

1389
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:52,723
I'm here because of you, Pete, okay,
so I don't care what you have to do.

1390
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:55,893
You gotta make this happen, okay?
You owe me.

1391
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:04,568
Well, you can take an early retirement,
collect disability.

1392
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:06,737
With the pension,
you should be comfortable.

1393
01:37:06,905 --> 01:37:09,698
Save it. Being comfortable's overrated.

1394
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:12,701
Thank God we sent Matt down there
or we would have missed on this kid.

1395
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:14,912
That kid can't hit a curve.

1396
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:18,582
Gus, now that we're all aware
of your condition...

1397
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:22,628
...I can't help but ask,
how could you tell?

1398
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:24,880
I heard it.

1399
01:37:26,508 --> 01:37:27,549
You heard it?

1400
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:30,469
- That's right. And Mickey saw it.
- And Mickey saw it.

1401
01:37:30,637 --> 01:37:33,263
- This is getting interesting.
- Damn right she saw it.

1402
01:37:34,015 --> 01:37:36,141
Let me just get this straight.

1403
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:39,311
This year's pick was gonna
be based on what you heard...

1404
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:42,105
...and what your daughter, a girl, saw?

1405
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:45,776
We need to go down to the field. Mickey's
brought us something we gotta see.

1406
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:48,445
Oh, boy, I can't wait to see
what Mickey brought us.

1407
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,906
- Hey, you watch yourself.
- Let's go.

1408
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:55,953
Hey, here he comes.
Hey, Bo, how about a shot?

1409
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,120
Over here.

1410
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:58,956
Everything okay? Ah, nice.

1411
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,458
Hey, how's it going?
Show's about to start.

1412
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,627
Great. Go for it, kid.

1413
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:11,426
Oh, yeah.

1414
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:13,095
Wow.

1415
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:23,105
Whoo!

1416
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:29,903
All right, let's show them what you got.

1417
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:44,001
Oh, boy. He's got a nice swing.

1418
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:47,254
You got this.

1419
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:56,680
What the hell's going on?

1420
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:58,599
- I heard it.
- What?

1421
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,892
The pure sound, I heard it.

1422
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:06,189
Come on. What is this?
We don't have all day.

1423
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:10,152
Gentlemen, this is Rigoberto Sanchez.

1424
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:12,988
Peanut Boy?

1425
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:15,782
Son of a bitch.

1426
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:19,161
Is this a joke?

1427
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:21,830
Y'all gonna waste my time on him?

1428
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:25,375
- That's it. I've seen all I need to see.
- Just hold your ass right there.

1429
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:32,883
All right. This is gonna be ugly.

1430
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:36,678
Start with the fastball.

1431
01:39:57,742 --> 01:39:58,992
You all right?

1432
01:39:59,369 --> 01:40:00,410
Yes, ma'am.

1433
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:02,329
Nervous?

1434
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:04,706
No, ma'am. It's just a game.

1435
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:11,088
You're right, Rigo. It's just a game.

1436
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:48,875
He looks like Sandy Koufax.

1437
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:51,670
Yep, combined with Steve Carlton
and Randy Johnson.

1438
01:40:51,838 --> 01:40:53,463
And that's not even his best pitch.

1439
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:55,966
Show him a curve.

1440
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:27,080
Nobody saw this?

1441
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:31,668
Gentry's got potential,
but using our number one pick?

1442
01:41:38,843 --> 01:41:40,093
Jesus Christ.

1443
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:48,435
Gentry knows it's coming,
he still can't hit it.

1444
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:55,901
Shit!

1445
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:58,320
Jesus Christ, who is this kid?

1446
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:01,198
What do you say now, jackass?

1447
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,534
That's known as trouble with the curve.

1448
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:10,916
Well, there's no doubt that Rigo Sanchez
should be offered a contract.

1449
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:12,459
You think? Heh.

1450
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:13,960
And he's gonna need an agent.

1451
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:15,295
He's got one.

1452
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:17,255
Mickey.

1453
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:20,884
She's a damn good lawyer and I'm sure
she can whip up some papers...

1454
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:23,887
- ... make that young man some money.
- Shit.

1455
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:25,847
Or she could have your job...

1456
01:42:26,015 --> 01:42:29,476
...because you sure as hell
don't know anything about the game.

1457
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:33,396
And if I'd have been any help,
she'd be managing her own club now...

1458
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:36,900
...because she knows more about baseball
than anyone in this room.

1459
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:38,819
It's okay, Dad.

1460
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:42,155
No. It's in my blood
and it's in your blood too.

1461
01:42:43,366 --> 01:42:45,617
I want you to be happy, that's all.

1462
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:53,333
Here's the reports
from last night's game.

1463
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:54,960
What about you, Gus?

1464
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:58,588
Your contract's gonna be up.
Are you interested in an extension?

1465
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:01,174
I'll think about that.

1466
01:43:01,342 --> 01:43:04,427
- Anything you want. You name it.
- I said, I'll think about it.

1467
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:05,595
Unbelievable.

1468
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:08,723
Billy Clark went five-for-five again.

1469
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:12,227
He's been hitting close to 400
since his folks came to visit him.

1470
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:17,274
How much did it cost this organization to put
his parents up? That's what I want to know.

1471
01:43:18,526 --> 01:43:19,860
Phillip...

1472
01:43:20,403 --> 01:43:22,070
...you're fired.

1473
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:26,199
Vince, wait a... Wait a sec. I'm sorry.

1474
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:30,453
I know I missed with Gentry and I'm sorry
about that, but this is real life.

1475
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:33,206
- We're gonna go get a little lunch.
- Yeah, I'm starving.

1476
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:37,502
I'll go to high school games. I like
high school. I mean, I just bought a boat.

1477
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:40,797
I've got private school. I'll take you fishing.

1478
01:43:44,427 --> 01:43:45,552
Well...

1479
01:43:46,304 --> 01:43:50,849
...I think maybe, maybe I could
change the way I do things.

1480
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:52,601
You already have.

1481
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,272
What would they want now?

1482
01:43:57,732 --> 01:44:02,611
Hmm. Todd's presentation didn't go
so well, so they're trying to...

1483
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:04,779
...push my, uh, partnership forward.

1484
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:07,240
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I'll think about it.

1485
01:44:07,825 --> 01:44:10,994
- No, I mean...
- I said, I'll think about it.

1486
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:23,506
Thank you.

1487
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:26,051
'77 World Series...

1488
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:30,847
...Reggie hits three homers in one game.

1489
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:33,266
Yeah.

1490
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:39,189
Name the pitchers he took deep.

1491
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:49,532
You came all this way to ask me that?

1492
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:54,496
Yeah.

1493
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:05,548
Charlie Hough, Elias Sosa, Burt Hooton.

1494
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:10,887
Is that it? Is that all you got?

1495
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:14,182
No.

1496
01:45:14,392 --> 01:45:16,226
I got a lot more than that.

1497
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:36,329
Well, looks like I'll be taking the bus.
