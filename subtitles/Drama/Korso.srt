1
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,160
<i>I bought the top yesterday.</i>

2
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,889
Hi, mum.

3
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,287
Why aren't you in bed?

4
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,689
I was just going.
I have a night shift tomorrow.

5
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,121
Good night.

6
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,723
<i>Fair maiden, when you grew up</i>

7
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,163
<i>under your father's roof</i>

8
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,365
<i>A hobo took your virginity</i>

9
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,484
<i>inside a portaloo</i>

10
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,964
Happy birthday. Old geezer!
Twenty years!

11
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,362
Markus! Let me go!

12
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,406
I mean it! I'm gonna be late!
Fucking hell!

13
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,841
Testo rules. Hey, don't!

14
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,202
Where's my present?

15
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,051
You owe me at least three presents.

16
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,288
Who's counting?

17
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,647
Happy birthday, bozo!

18
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,566
There's pizza in the fridge.
Happy birthday.

19
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,967
Bye then.
- Bye!

20
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,643
What did you do to your hair?
- Nothing.

21
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,165
Did you dye it?
You washed it!

22
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,522
Fuck you.
- Let's do it.

23
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,405
Véné, did you drink all my beers?

24
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,002
My birthday beer!
- No worries, we've got time.

25
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,363
What am I supposed to drink?
- There's sugar wine.

26
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,042
This isn't drinkable yet.
- You're right.

27
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,527
That's your last one.

28
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,848
Shouldn't sixth-formers drink wine?
- Eh?

29
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,601
Our Finnish teacher thinks
Heta should apply.

30
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
What's that about?
- I'm not sure I'll apply.

31
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,450
You'll turn into a tosser
like all sixth-formers.

32
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,720
You don't need the sixth form,
you're already a tosser.

33
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,002
Girl, you nicked it!
- I did not!

34
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,965
Okay. Hartikainen saw me
but didn't say anything.

35
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,567
Better not get pissed
and start snogging anyone.

36
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,169
We'd have made it
if you hadn't stopped to take a leak!

37
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,204
One minute past!
- What a fucking birthday!

38
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,926
Where's the party?
- Hey, girls!

39
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,566
Can we tag along?
- It's his birthday,

40
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,047
give him a pity fuck at least.

41
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,608
I like your shirt! I could pick it up
from my floor tomorrow.

42
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,406
Can we even afford a pint each?

43
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,649
What a wingman!
- Come on, they weren't gonna put out.

44
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,525
They could have invited us
to their party.

45
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,291
That chick looked really familiar.

46
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,691
I know, she was Hérkénen's sister!

47
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,202
Get the fuck out of here!
- Look, it's Murikka.

48
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,483
Hey, Murikka. I think that's enough.

49
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,482
What did he do?

50
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,603
The entry fee is five euros.
- It's always been free!

51
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,928
Today it's a fiver.
- Why?

52
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,600
Do you take meal vouchers?
- No.

53
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,647
When I get to NewYork,
I'll find a flat

54
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,367
where you can lie in bed
and see the skyscrapers.

55
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,724
A lemon, makes it fresher.
- Buy a proper liquor cabinet as well.

56
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,720
Yeah, for parties.
- And the top 5 of guests includes

57
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,446
Megan Fox and Cameron Diaz...

58
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,804
No, Cameron is way too old.
Who's the chick with the amazing lips?

59
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,651
Mila Kunis is mine.
- I'd do her!

60
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,446
She'd do me, not you!

61
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,689
And Prince. Let's invite him, too.

62
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,724
What the fuck?
- He's not a chick.

63
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,362
Just an idea.

64
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,046
You're useless.

65
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,287
That was close.

66
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,722
Who can make the shot?

67
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,610
The trajectory...
It was fucking perfect.

68
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,321
But you're the star.
Show us how it's done.

69
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,691
Fuck, that was smooth. Great shot.

70
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,042
Right in the middle.

71
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,128
Height is overrated.
The Professor is 178 cm

72
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,130
and one of the best players
in the world.

73
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,328
Of course the blokes in NBA
are huge as fuck,

74
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,002
but Nate Robinson is the same height.
- 175.

75
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,045
175 cm.
- And dunks like nobody's business.

76
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,762
But all the real talent is in
streetball these days. You know why?

77
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,928
It's creative.

78
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,641
You're free. You can do what you want.

79
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,165
You have your own style.
No coaches telling you how to play.

80
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,489
Hartsa?

81
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,202
Wake up, Hartikainen.

82
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,562
Véné, let's play.

83
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,929
You look like a fucking nightmare.
- I should drink less.

84
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,203
You're pathetic.
- I hallucinated this morning.

85
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,609
Baby Shaq was taking a piss
in our bathroom.

86
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,442
Baby Shaq, the basketball player?
- Yeah. it felt so real.

87
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,366
This is Jojo. And my brother, Markus.

88
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,045
Hi.

89
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,451
Catch you later.
- I'll call you.

90
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,606
What the fuck are you up to?
- Look who's talking!

91
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,966
I heard something funny.

92
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,806
Murikka founded a company,
Weirdox Ltd.

93
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,129
Opened accounts in shops
and maxed out the credit.

94
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,971
The three biggest hardware shops.

95
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,649
Bought stuff for 30 grand
and sold them for half the price.

96
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,286
That makes 15 grand or something.

97
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,721
People are so stoked
when a Finn goes to Hollywood.

98
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,924
Antti Jokinen, for example. Big deal!

99
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,090
In the States they make at least
a thousand films a year.

100
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,282
Who's the spook?

101
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,526
Is Heta into development aid?

102
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,641
Didn't Renny's films do okay?
- Renny Harlin?

103
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,810
He knows the right people
but he's got no vision.

104
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,128
I didn't say he had.

105
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,089
Nice!

106
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,849
Watch it!

107
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,801
You've had a few beers, then?

108
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,925
1,257 cans. All different.
- Really?

109
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,250
I want a house whose lounge wall
is all covered with these.

110
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,887
I've calculated that
6,000 cans should be enough.

111
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,845
Did you calculate
how to buy the house?

112
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,481
I'm still working on it.

113
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,331
What's up with you two?
- You're a nifty player.

114
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,569
Talking to me?
- I saw a streetball event in Tiksi.

115
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,764
My mates were playing.
- In Tiksi?

116
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,850
I see. The only real
streetball event is Ball Up.

117
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,731
You know? The tour in the States.

118
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,608
They scout the streets for players.
They've found many stars that way.

119
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,406
Markus has been saving up
for a long time.

120
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,444
Not that long.
- For real?

121
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,488
Yeah, I figured I could participate.
- In the States?

122
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,048
The next open run
is in New York in two weeks.

123
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,811
And you're going?
- Hell yeah.

124
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,250
You need talent,
but then it's just hard work.

125
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,602
Hey, we should go.

126
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,009
Does Markus go to trade school?
- He dropped out.

127
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,966
He's got the same upper lip
as all chavs. Like this...

128
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,724
And when they show off,
they're like this...

129
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,001
Give it a rest already.

130
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,531
Baby, don't get upset.

131
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,449
What?

132
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,482
Stand back!

133
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,962
There's a shitload of them!
- I told you!

134
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,722
Throw them there.

135
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,809
Right there.

136
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,685
I could use a shag. To warm me up.

137
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,247
Only two more hours.

138
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,208
How much do you think they're worth?
- At least 200 if we're lucky.

139
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,488
Alrighty then.

140
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,522
Is that money I smell?
- This'll take a while.

141
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,447
We're fucking geniuses.

142
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,406
What the fuck?
- Try the other one.

143
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,611
It won't accept this one either.
- The machine is broken!

144
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,211
Estonian cans have no deposit.

145
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,085
What do you mean?
- No deposit!

146
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,090
I dragged these cans here,
and you won't pay?

147
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,524
Life sucks sometimes.
- What did you say? Fucking hipster!

148
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,930
Come over here and say that again!
- Let it go.

149
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,681
Fivers each...
- What?

150
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,408
Is this it?
- Some change, too. A couple of euros.

151
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,847
I don't believe this shit.

152
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,606
That's fucking Korso for you.

153
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,080
No use even trying.

154
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,641
Is Murikka around?

155
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,009
Murikka, do you have a minute?
- No.

156
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,408
Don't you get it?

157
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,927
It's important.
- Piss off!

158
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,521
I wasn't talking to you.
- What did you say?

159
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,564
<i>Artsi, go and buy Ruusu a pint.</i>

160
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,530
What do you want, ball boy?

161
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,922
I need work.

162
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,767
What can you do?

163
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,642
I could carry...

164
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,320
Turn off that fucking music!

165
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,046
I could carry something...

166
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,200
or shovel...
- Shovel.

167
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,291
Or clean, or anything.

168
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,411
How much were you thinking of?

169
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,122
A grand.

170
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,367
You've got balls.

171
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,640
What do you want me to do?

172
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,527
We'll figure it out.

173
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,963
But hey, this was great.

174
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,162
Great.

175
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,006
Are you fucking crazy? From Murikka?
- Where else?

176
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,444
It's no payday loan.
He'll kill you if you don't pay back.

177
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,530
I'll pay him. And it's not urgent.

178
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,725
Are you really a match for them in
New York? - I just have to practice.

179
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,562
They're not all doing pirouettes.
Take the bounce dunk, for example.

180
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,207
You just have to practice
step-by-step. First three strides,

181
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,086
ball to the floor, jump,
and then you just dunk.

182
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,363
'You just dunk?'
- Méétténen on the left!

183
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,689
Hult, you know you can't eat here.

184
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,963
Or does Hult the Hooligan
miss the school?

185
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,647
Who cares about your classes, wanker.
- Right!

186
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,921
What are you gonna do?

187
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,727
Your countdown has begun, too.
- I may become marginalized!

188
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,730
Looks that way.
- Let's get out of here.

189
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,203
Next time I'll call the police.

190
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,042
Where are you off to?

191
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,402
Where is he going?

192
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,442
Hey, Jojo!

193
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,645
Stay away from my sister.
- Look, it's the basketball star!

194
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,730
I'm so scared.
- Did you hear me?

195
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,003
Didn't you find anyone to beat up?

196
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,521
What? The King of Korso.

197
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,200
This is how long I'll rot in here.

198
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,409
Now we're gonna buy some shoes.
- Hey, look at that bloke.

199
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,609
Piss-arse drunk
in the middle of the day.

200
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,531
The rich are morons,
just like the rest.

201
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,681
You look like a pro!
- Those cougars are checking you out.

202
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,811
I have the best arse in NYC.
- Markus, I want these.

203
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,889
They're cool as fuck.

204
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,731
Do they fit?
- These feel really good.

205
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,366
He's going to NYC to play.

206
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,449
I'll leave these on.

207
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,008
And we'll take the shades as well.
- That's right.

208
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,289
Hey, wanna come to my farewell party?

209
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,485
It'd be nice,
but my boyfriend wouldn't like it.

210
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,081
You're breaking my heart!

211
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,608
That was really good.

212
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,607
I'll fix us a ride.

213
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,562
Hi, what's up?
- Not much.

214
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,809
What's the occasion?
- A mate is going on exchange.

215
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,321
Really? Where?
- The States.

216
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,444
I'm going as well. Where?
- Florida.

217
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,881
Markus, come here!

218
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,163
Why are you going?
- To play basketball.

219
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,409
That's my ball bearer and my coach.

220
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,251
Bollocks. I'm the manager.
- Yeah, you look like it.

221
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,725
Could you give us a ride?
- I don't think there's room...

222
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,730
This is a minivan!
- Not this time.

223
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,403
If you give us a ride, my hair
won't be the only wet thing tonight.

224
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,524
Is that your friend over there?
- Karla!

225
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,731
Take it easy.
- We've been waiting for ages.

226
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,164
It's like the lottery,
we've got no chance. Look at them!

227
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,331
I don't know how to open it.
- The one with the bag is yours.

228
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,047
Could you help us?
- Go and show them.

229
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,604
Hi. Are you Karla?
- Yeah.

230
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,327
I'm Markus.
- Do I know you from somewhere?

231
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,171
Not yet.
- It's open!

232
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,649
Yes.

233
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,447
Thanks a lot. Have a nice day.
- Let's go.

234
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,924
I told you! No fucking chance!

235
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,447
Hey, how about that ride?

236
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,849
It's raining! Come on.
It's my last night.

237
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,328
It's so different.
Streetball is like...

238
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,801
It's free.
I reckon it's more like dancing.

239
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,129
Are you really going to the States?
- Yeah.

240
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,523
We could meet up somewhere halfway.
- Where are you going? I've got wine.

241
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,530
We're going to a party.

242
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,203
You have wine, we have beer.
We have to drink them somewhere.

243
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,446
I noticed your jeans are dirty.
You could take them off later,

244
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,201
and we can wash them
on my washboard abs. How about it?

245
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,289
In your dreams.

246
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,249
Go straight until the water tower.

247
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,762
Turn right! There!
- What the fuck is this place?

248
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,646
Where's the party?
- It's wherever we are!

249
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,483
We're here.

250
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,481
Ta-dah!
- I'd leave right now.

251
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,684
Hurry up!
- I want to go to Helsinki.

252
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,322
Fucking hell.

253
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,923
I can help you with those.
- We don't even have to open the cans!

254
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,889
My dad's car is stuck.

255
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,011
It'll come out when the sun
starts to shine and it dries off.

256
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,921
It may be broken!
- No, it's not! It's American.

257
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,091
At least I won't get hammered
with this drizzle.

258
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,409
This is how Markus makes
his first 3-point shot.

259
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,089
Jump! No!

260
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,681
He)', guys, it's my only ball!

261
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,127
Well, I'll buy a new ball from NYC.
A better one.

262
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,484
You can swim by yourself.
- I can help you undress.

263
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,160
Do you have a bikini?
- No.

264
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,126
When you're old and
nobody wants to kiss you anymore,

265
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,962
you'll remember the lovely boy
from Korso who wanted to kiss.

266
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,324
But you were like: 'I'm a bit busy,
going to Florida and everything.'

267
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,287
The lovely boy from Korso...
- I'm lovely for a guy from Korso.

268
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,564
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

269
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,128
Your arse was up for grabs! Chill!

270
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,448
Karla, we're leaving.

271
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,329
Do you hear me?
That fucking shithead is too drunk.

272
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,649
I want to get out of here.
- What happened?

273
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,967
Have a nice exchange!

274
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,443
You're a fucking hero.
- Well done.

275
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,809
A Finnish man just wants some intimacy
but the bitch gets upset!

276
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,443
Easy for you to smile!
- 'The lovely boy from Korso.'

277
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,007
I'm so gonna use that next time.

278
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,410
Have you been raving about
some plane tickets?

279
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,524
I bought them. I'm going to New York.

280
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,047
With what?
- None of your business.

281
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,925
For real. You can't just go there.

282
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,246
Where are you going to stay?
- I just need to get started.

283
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,604
Mum's got some relatives there.
- We don't even know them.

284
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,726
A little snack.

285
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,882
I was thinking you could tag along.
- Fuck you.

286
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,641
My Golden American Express
will take care of the expenses.

287
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,684
You've got no chance
against those black tanks.

288
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,329
You'll be totally clueless in Harlem.
You even get lost in Helsinki!

289
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,205
The roadworks confused me!

290
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,961
'My name is Markus from Finland.
Please don't hurt me.'

291
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,647
Let's take a ride.

292
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,730
I'll clear the seat.
Hold that for a bit.

293
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,726
Fuck all this stuff.

294
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,883
Okay. Are you good?
- Yeah.

295
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,202
<i>High winds. Sea breeze near the coast.
The skies are mostly clear.</i>

296
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,167
<i>The temperatures will range from</i>
a <i>few degrees below zero to plus five...</i>

297
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,327
Have some nuggets.

298
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,286
No thanks, I just ate.
- Come on. The dip is excellent.

299
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,520
Try the other dip as well.

300
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,491
We were supposed to go fishing,

301
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,648
but we'll see.

302
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,843
How about you? Going on any trips?

303
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,289
No.

304
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,203
Hey, what are you doing?
Calm down!

305
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,569
Goddammit!

306
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,525
Do you think I'm stupid, eh?
- No!

307
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,241
You think you can leave
without paying your debt?

308
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,647
I'll pay you back!

309
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,969
Pay your goddamn debt!
- It hurts!

310
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,130
Pay, motherfucker!
- I'll give you 1,500 next week!

311
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,848
Let me go!

312
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,801
Do you hear?
Fucking fatso, open the door!

313
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,721
Come and get your backpack.

314
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,448
Two days.

315
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,771
Did you apply for that job
we were talking about?

316
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,888
No. They required two years
of work experience and a degree...

317
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,887
And you're not going back to school?

318
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,526
Maybe later.

319
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,520
How about training courses
for the unemployed...

320
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,803
There's a creativity workshop...

321
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,005
I sort of need
some cash right now.

322
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,287
'Cos my mum died.

323
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,688
Sorry...

324
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,090
Honestly, I'm screwed. I borrowed
money from the wrong person,

325
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,921
and he's gonna kill me
if I don't pay him back tomorrow.

326
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,050
How stupid do you think I am?

327
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,962
Do you think you can come here to lie,
and we'll just give you the money?

328
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,449
Typical. You people claim you want to
help, but when I really need help...

329
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,206
Go fuck yourself, Terttu!

330
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,767
Social services fail you every time.
- They just fuss over their refugees.

331
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,849
Don't you have anything to sell?

332
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,761
A friend of Vana's brother made
good money with an insurance fraud.

333
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,964
He'd claimed his boombox
had been stolen.

334
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,970
I don't think we have insurance.

335
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,524
Should you call your dad in Sweden?

336
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,609
Fuck!

337
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,125
Or is he still upset 'cos you drank
the money for your driving license?

338
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,887
<i>Hello.</i>
- Hi...

339
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,607
Hi, it's Markus.
- <i>Nice of</i> you to <i>call.</i>

340
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,371
Hi, how are you doing?

341
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,370
<i>Watch it! Daddy's on the phone.</i>

342
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,248
<i>Emma and Johan have been ill.
Just some virus. How are you all?</i>

343
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,047
Yeah... Look, I was wondering...

344
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,723
<i>How's school?
I could get</i> a <i>summer job for you.</i>

345
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,766
Hasse might <i>have</i> something.
- Thanks for the birthday card.

346
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,128
<i>Oh, you got</i> it...

347
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,648
Well?

348
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,047
I didn't ask him.

349
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,723
Sorry, I didn't hear.
- Is Hartsa at home?

350
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,684
Haven't seen him for a while...
- His mobile is off.

351
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,724
Jo-johannes?
- What is it?

352
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,409
Well?

353
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,007
Get down!

354
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,202
Hurry UP!

355
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,486
Any luck?
- Stop grilling me! I can do this.

356
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,761
Holy shit, it started!

357
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,967
Shout when you see it.
- Which one is it?

358
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,766
Guys, this is for real.

359
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,726
Are you absolutely sure you're in?
- Of course.

360
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,449
Let's go, then.

361
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,409
I'll keep watch.
- Where's the key?

362
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,607
Well well, look at this...

363
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,330
Are you sure no-one's home?
- Pretty sure.

364
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,409
What do you mean 'pretty'?

365
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,763
What if some geezer
skitters forth with a shotgun?

366
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,442
We'll run. Or say:
'Make us some coffee.'

367
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,722
Let's be quick.

368
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,565
What about these?
- They're glass.

369
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,081
No, they're crystal!

370
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,087
Here's only some shot glasses.

371
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,208
Look at this!

372
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,163
This could be a good foreplay
with some chick!

373
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,291
Right...
- Then what?

374
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,206
Let's start with these.

375
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,248
Got it?
- Yeah.

376
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,804
We've got to be quick. Quickly now!

377
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,002
I found some tools!

378
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,851
Let's take them.
- Totally.

379
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,520
Did anyone look down there?

380
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,447
Wow. Unbelievable.

381
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,361
It's like heaven!

382
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,406
Exactly what I want.
The cans could go here.

383
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,242
I could put up narrow shelves
and arrange the cans by country.

384
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,161
Cover them up with Plexiglas
so I won't have to dust them.

385
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,923
Hey, there's a bar!
- Fucking hell.

386
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,808
No way! An album by Dolly Parton!
She's unbelievably hot!

387
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,924
Isn't she an old hag?
- She's a quality babe.

388
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,644
Oops!

389
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,889
Oops.

390
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,928
Hey, Véné!

391
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,446
Kill the music! Someone can hear!

392
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,201
Véné, let's get out of here!

393
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,321
Let's go!
- Yeah, yeah.

394
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,443
Was there someone there?
- Whoa!

395
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,762
Was there?
- No idea.

396
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,964
Yes!

397
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,530
That stuff is totally worth a grand.
- What's that bloody garden gnome?

398
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,451
Did you nick a fucking eagle, eh?

399
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,005
What's that?
- Did I hit something?

400
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,249
What the fuck is that sound?
- It's coming from here.

401
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,091
Maybe it's the exhaust. Pull over!

402
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,722
The pipe fell apart.

403
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,647
Did it come loose?
- The clamp is broken.

404
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,845
It'll take a couple of minutes.
It's easy to fix.

405
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,251
Mayfly larvae are best
for ice fishing.

406
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,125
Shit!
- I've used normal maggots.

407
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,010
Yeah.
- It's so traditional.

408
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,003
Well, maybe it just conked out.

409
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,288
There are tools.
Maybe they tried to fix it.

410
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,130
<i>Will</i> you check the plate number?
- Yeah.

411
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,800
Have you tried blue maggots?

412
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,482
Yeah, when catching perches.
But not for chars.

413
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,331
Do chars like different colour?

414
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,285
Freeze! This is the police! Get down!

415
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,247
Let me go!

416
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,171
Fuck! Stop it!

417
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,085
Take it easy.
- Fucking let me go!

418
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,800
You're breaking my arm!

419
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,409
My shoulder...
- This was a spunky one.

420
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,289
Station, this is fourteen.

421
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,610
Will you check this plate number...

422
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,650
Let's go. - if we leave the van,
this was all for nothing.

423
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,004
We must finish this, or we'll have
both the cops and Murikka after us.

424
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,891
Walk home if you're so scared!

425
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,721
Just carry it in.

426
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,168
For ages over 7.
Why not even younger...

427
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,362
Are we even?

428
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,167
Goddammit, ball boy.

429
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,761
I'd never have thought...

430
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,328
Stop by at the pub sometime,
I'll buy you a pint.

431
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,122
We couldn't do anything fancy.

432
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,686
The equipment in our school's
film club is not that good.

433
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,008
I like this bit.

434
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,289
Check this out!

435
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,321
This is a no-budget film.

436
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,802
I'll call you.

437
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,164
What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

438
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,809
Do you think
they'll like you like that?

439
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,164
Fucking sixth-former. You reckon
you'll get in by putting out?

440
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,285
Where are you going?
- Another time.

441
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,529
I can do it,
you just have to stand still.

442
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,809
Why did it have to be Hartsa
who got caught.

443
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,685
With his previous
car thefts and all...

444
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,881
How about the flat in NYC?
- Still working on it.

445
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,202
It's looking good.

446
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,441
Look!
- Hartsa.

447
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,043
Is everything okay?
- Good to see you.

448
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,610
Should we go to Jane's now?
- I think I'll go home.

449
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,081
I see. Okay.

450
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,362
Are we going?
- Yeah, let's go.

451
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,962
Can you give me a ride
or something?

452
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,168
Mum...

453
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,641
I'm making a mess. Lend me a hand.

454
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,403
Were you saying something?
- Well...

455
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,162
I'm not sure if the sixth form
is my thing...

456
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,082
Yeah, you struggled at school
even when you were little.

457
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,921
I thought you were never
going to learn how to read.

458
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,689
Remember that time
at the railway station when you read:

459
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,451
R-E-K-O-L-A...

460
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,284
Korso!

461
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:47,211
The cops called the van's owner.
He looked outside and was like 'what?

462
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,405
The van was parked right there.
- And you didn't say anything?

463
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,171
They kept grilling me about the van.

464
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,041
And they asked about some house,
but they didn't have any proof.

465
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,891
Way to go, Hartsa! You showed them!

466
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,124
Let's drink to that. Bottoms up!

467
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,967
Well, there's still
'resisting arrest with violence'.

468
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,967
Are you going inside?

469
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,128
We'll see.

470
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,361
Tomorrow you'll be
somewhere above the Atlantic.

471
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,802
You're a celebrity soon.
- And the top 5 of people we shag...

472
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,123
First I'm gonna make Miley Cyrus
bite the pillow!

473
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,051
What about you, Markus?
- Not now.

474
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,801
Don't be such a tight-arse.
- I'm not in the mood.

475
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,528
Are you getting your period?
I can get you some pussy pads...

476
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,007
I said leave it!

477
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,090
I forgot,
Markus is better than the rest.

478
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,330
Hey, guys. Tonight we'll celebrate!

479
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,927
I'm going now.

480
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,210
You borrowed my hoodie.
Do you have it?

481
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,005
What I said earlier...
- I heard Hartsa is going to jail.

482
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,603
Do you have something to do with it?
- Stop listening to bullshit.

483
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,886
Heta said you're leaving today.

484
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,525
Bloody boots.
- You came.

485
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,724
I figured I can come and say bye.

486
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,727
Wanna warm up?

487
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,521
White boy...

488
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,007
Can you play at all?

489
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,882
'I'm Jojo, a great film director.'

490
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,289
'Everybody sucks
except me and Ed Wood.'

491
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,524
You think you'll make it in New York?
You're gonna be fucked.

492
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,168
Show me what you've got!

493
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,200
You're fucking pathetic!

494
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,402
Did it feel good?

495
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,010
Calm down!
- Fucking coon, yuck.

496
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,402
Stop it!

497
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,648
Get off him!

498
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,601
Who do you think you are?
You and your stuck-up friends!

499
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,246
You know nothing about real life!

500
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,445
I didn't mean it!
- You're so fucking fake!

501
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,968
Give me a break.

502
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,042
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the train
will wait for another train to pass.</i>

503
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,369
<i>We'll stop for</i> a <i>couple of minutes.</i>

504
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:10,443
<i>Vantaa, the foggy and misty city</i>

505
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,007
<i>No-one even knows their neighbour</i>

506
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,366
<i>Everyone's in</i> a <i>hurry
smiles are rare</i>

507
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:33,282
<i>The invisible strings
tug and pull at the puppets</i>

508
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,721
<i>I see the sturdy forest
and the blue hills</i>

509
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,888
Mummy!

510
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,840
<i>Let's give a big hand to Murikka
for a great performance.</i>

511
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:08,126
<i>Next up is Pena with
T he Shadows of the Night'.</i>

512
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,606
I can buy you that pint now.

513
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,649
Two pints.

514
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,931
Have you been in a fight?

515
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,647
Come sit with us.

516
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,283
Méhonen...
- What did he do?

517
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,962
He kicked in the rear window
of some crappy Mazda.

518
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,369
His foot got stuck
and he was dragged behind the car.

519
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,643
His face was a bloody pulp.
- What did he say?

520
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,320
'Where can I get more booze?'

521
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,169
Goddammit.

522
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,682
Did Mahonen's face
look a bit different?

523
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,962
Should we take him to the hospital?

524
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,802
What the fuck are you doing here?
You're flight is leaving.

525
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,241
In seven minutes!

526
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,087
I don't think I'll make it.
- What are you on about?

527
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,208
Beer...

528
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,531
Markus, what are you doing?

529
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,484
It's a fucking shame,
but hey, I'm an asshole.

530
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,087
Let's go.
- And leave that idiot alone.

531
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,125
Hey, guys. No smoking.
It's the law.

532
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,449
Law? It's the law, eh?
- Yes.

533
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,571
It's the Finnish law!
- One drag and I'll put it out.

534
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,325
Look, what the fuck is he doing?

535
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,523
Goddammit!
He stubbed it out on his forehead!

536
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,291
Bring us more booze!

537
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,804
Drink up, drink up!

538
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,170
A toast to Korso.
- To Korso.

539
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,563
Korso, Korso...

540
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,405
Hey, where are we going?

541
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,929
Korso!

542
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,004
Calm the fuck down!

543
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:10,370
When I look at you,
I see myself 15 years ago.

544
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,204
We do things, and others follow.

545
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,805
You're so fucking crazy that you're
capable of anything! Get it?

546
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,604
Have some, go on.

547
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,970
Hey, ball boy! Going for a jog?

548
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,720
Where do you think you're going?

549
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,601
Leave me alone.

550
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,451
I'm gonna smash your face.
- Fucking pussy.

551
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,565
Your dick is so small you couldn't
stand your sister fucking a black guy.

552
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,808
Fuck!

553
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,401
Kick his ass!

554
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,001
You don't have to worry.

555
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,242
The nigger is out.
Heta dumped me.

556
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,408
Fucking coon.
- Kick his ass already!

557
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,763
Come on, then. What?

558
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,926
What the fuck are you looking at?
I'll fuck all your sisters and mums!

559
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,169
You're a dead man!
- Back off!

560
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,762
The lad can take care of this.
- Come on then!

561
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,645
Fucking dickheads. Suck this!
- What the fuck?

562
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,842
Well?
- I'll fucking beat you to death!

563
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,327
Don't! Let him go!

564
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,687
Hey! Fuck off!

565
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,001
Fuck off, everyone!

566
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,411
Thanks... I'll never forget...

567
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,806
Let's get the fuck out of here.

568
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,081
What are you guys welding?

569
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,848
Smoker boxes.

570
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,687
I've made only seven so far.

571
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,209
Tut-tut.

572
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,289
Leksa said I make the cleanest seams
he's seen in a while.

573
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,006
Who's Leksa? One of your fucks?

574
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,362
Shut up, Swede.

575
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,846
Hasse's Copy Shop...

576
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,691
I'll be sweating behind a photocopier.

577
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,963
But Hasse seems okay
for a friend of my dad's.

578
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,970
How will you spend all that fortune?

579
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,686
I figured I could check out NewYork.

580
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,169
Fuck you.
- Just for a visit.

581
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,561
Then I could continue south.

582
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,646
Stop by in Florida.

583
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,247
'The lovely boy from Korso.'
- Cuba could be cool, too.

584
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,963
There's a school for voodoo priests
in Havana. Should I apply?

585
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:01,324
I saw some pics of their parties.
Looked a bit whacky...

586
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,801
And the babes... Jesus.

587
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:52,089
Sorry, sorry! Nobody chooses
their clothes as slowly as him.

588
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,760
Come on, it didn't take that long.

589
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,046
He's got a special song
for choosing shoes.

590
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:02,165
Is it typical for sixth-formers?
- Yeah, they taught it first thing.

591
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,486
Remember to study or I'll come back
to watch over your arse.

592
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,886
I'm glad to get rid of you.

593
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,481
I'm not gonna miss you, either.

594
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,528
You're gonna be late.

595
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,045
<i>Welcome on board M/S Mariella.</i>

596
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,040
<i>We will arrive in Stockholm
at 10</i> a.m. <i>local time.</i>

597
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:55,360
