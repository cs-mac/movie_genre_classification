1
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,816
Long ago...

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,725
<i>...the Medicine Game was given to the people
of the Haudenosaunee...</i>

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,331
<i>...to entertain the Creator.</i>

4
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,697
Ooh.

5
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,173
Holy stick work!

6
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,347
Somebody better mail that guy's helmet
back from Syracuse.

7
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:34,958
Outlet pass and Coventry Academy is pulling
off another dominating coast-to-coast play.

8
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,772
Another goal for Coventry Academy!

9
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,799
All-Star middie Clay Watson
just obliterated a Sunaquot defender.

10
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,172
- Chewy, take him out!
- How did you miss that?

11
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,974
- Are you all right?
- I can't move it.

12
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,477
Let's bring it in.

13
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:07,852
And at halftime, the defending champs
lead the overmatched Sunaquot, eight to three.

14
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,517
It's game one of the season
and it's time for this team to tap out.

15
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,689
If anyone's still listening, please enjoy
this commercial-free intermission...

16
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:20,564
...as we still have no sponsors, here on
the Bryan Sports Broadcasting Network...

17
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,402
...the number one and only radio show
covering upstate prep school lacrosse...

18
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,910
...and streaming live on BSBN.com.

19
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,549
All right, guys, bunch up.

20
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:37,654
Listen, they are a very good team.
But we can be too.

21
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,121
We have got to bring our minds
together as one.

22
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,188
- Chewy, you gotta move your feet.
- I do move my feet. They move theirs faster.

23
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,161
Reed, you can stop some shots
if you take a step toward the shooter.

24
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,334
- Cut down the angle.
- I was protecting my backside.

25
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,527
This ain't dodgeball, moron.
Your job is to try and get hit.

26
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,899
And your job is to pass the ball, Jimmy.

27
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,769
Owen was wide open
when you got your ass handed to you.

28
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,967
Oh, whipped.

29
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,108
Owen. Sammy. Enough.

30
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,684
Starters, get ready for the second half.

31
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,219
We'd be better off scrimmaging
our middle-school team.

32
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,413
But I'm not gonna let today go to waste.

33
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,220
In the second half,
I want you all using your weak hands.

34
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,626
But don't you let up. Not for one second.
Remember who we are.

35
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,355
Scared to go back?

36
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,195
- I'm hurt.
- Your feelings or your shoulder?

37
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,894
- A kiss would fix both.
- Ha.

38
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,573
Ah!

39
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,833
- Toby, you're in.
- Me?

40
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,375
At attack.
- Against Coventry?

41
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,409
Okay...

42
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,523
Number 17 is a real firecracker.

43
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,220
Keep it up! Give him that shaft! Get him, Nadie!

44
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,868
This guy is frustrating the Coventry
offense with relentless position defense.

45
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,926
Uh-Oh.

46
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,875
Number 17 is blindsided by an illegal hit.

47
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,209
You gotta be kidding me, man!

48
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:19,322
Here we go! It's a fight, folks!
A rumble on the rez.

49
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,720
Watson, Dawes, enough!

50
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,358
Come on, boy. Want a taste, Wonder Bread?

51
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,763
- Back! Get back.
- Jimmy!

52
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,268
Jimmy, sideline!

53
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,440
Keep your helmet on!

54
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,308
Geronimo!

55
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:43,504
Get off of him! Chewy, on the bench!

56
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,614
- Get off of him!
- Enough!

57
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,079
Keep your helmets on.

58
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,446
Sam my, stop it.

59
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,813
Nadie.

60
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,322
- Come on.
- No! Ow!

61
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,429
Stay there!
They're not worth it anyways!

62
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,936
<i>Hey, seems as though you got me shaking</i>

63
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:15,101
<i>Hey, you make me cry</i>

64
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,607
<i>You start me up
And then you leave</i>

65
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,752
<i>You're changing right in front of me</i>

66
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,792
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

67
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,367
Winning some wampum, ladies?

68
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,833
Oh, my God! Ah!

69
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,907
Three Tom Hot Toddies.
I want to get that jackpot back.

70
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,906
Don't shoot, Chief.

71
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,410
Oh! Five dollar free play!

72
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,913
Ah. Impressive stacks, ladies.

73
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,086
Hey. Got a fortune for me, Chiefy?

74
00:07:56,275 --> 00:08:00,382
Of course. Chiefy always has fortunes
for beautiful Indian maidens.

75
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,186
- There you go.
- I hope he has one for me too.

76
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,690
Mr. Geyer.

77
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:09,390
Ladies, if you don't mind,
I'd like to borrow Chiefy for a minute.

78
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,200
That's impressive design work, Joe.

79
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,138
But how far have you gotten
with the casino expansion rights?

80
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,110
Almost there. I'm meeting
with my primary opposition this evening.

81
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,075
Hmm.

82
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:33,721
Joe, I came to you with this deal because you
were a closer when you worked for me.

83
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,827
And I can guarantee a full partnership
if you pull this off.

84
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,521
But there are a lot of other poor Indian tribes
out there with wasted land.

85
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,567
Yes, but we Sunaquot are poorer
and more wasted than most.

86
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,570
I want to help your people,
but I can't wait forever.

87
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:59,784
Ah. Look, tell your people
whatever it is they want to hear...

88
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,285
...and get my deal done.

89
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,735
Nadie, you need to get that leg elevated.

90
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,709
This is your fault.

91
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,985
Why did you enter the game?

92
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,657
Because nobody else would go in, Daddy.

93
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,290
And I was kicking ass out there,
you saw me play.

94
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,963
And I heard the doctor.

95
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,760
And if you don't heal properly,
you may never play again.

96
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,062
I've got a meeting at the Pow Wow.

97
00:09:55,261 --> 00:10:00,267
You stay with her, this pain medication
can have some side effects.

98
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,739
Oh, no funny business, you two.

99
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:10,315
Right, because I can't wait to hook up with
the guy that got my ankle broken in two places.

100
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,922
I told you, it's not my fault.
Nobody made you go in the game.

101
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,024
Okay, nobody had to, Jimmy.

102
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,890
We needed a player and you were hurt,
so I stepped up.

103
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,605
Ow! Okay, I said leave me alone!

104
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,937
Now we know the side effects.

105
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,855
Good day for a Pow Wow.

106
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,857
How you doing, man?

107
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,262
Hey, Rollingstone. What's up, my man?

108
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,064
It's Rollingwind.

109
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,205
I've told you like 10 times before.

110
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,703
Yeah, I meant that.

111
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,570
Julie? Julie Gifford?

112
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,974
What are you doing here?

113
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,150
- I teach high school.
- Since when?

114
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,341
Like two weeks ago.
What are you doing here?

115
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,214
I run the casino.

116
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,891
So how you been?

117
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,650
I'm good. I'm really good.

118
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,725
The casino, huh?

119
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,693
Figures. Joe Money
pimping out his people.

120
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,066
Wow, really?

121
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:35,501
You do know that my casino profits
paid for your brand-new school buildings.

122
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,539
So if I'm a pimp,
what does that make you?

123
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,544
Ah!
- Grandma!

124
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,112
Ah...

125
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,644
Julie!

126
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:06,025
Of all the teachers in New York,
you just had to hire my ex-girlfriend?

127
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,434
Dr. Gifford is more than a teacher.

128
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,629
Doctor?

129
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,176
Julie wrote the only book there is
about the Sunaquot culture.

130
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,842
You should take one.

131
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,074
It's very enlightening.

132
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,952
And she was the only applicant
we could afford to pay.

133
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,956
Which is a perfect reason
you should deed more land to the casino.

134
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,294
You know my position, son.
We have no more land.

135
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,887
Dad, land is all we have.

136
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,226
And land is all we need.

137
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,399
Come on, let's just enjoy the celebration.

138
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,832
Celebration? What celebration?

139
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,211
Nobody came to the Pow Wow.

140
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,307
Drive downtown
and see the men begging for work.

141
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,984
And then tell me
that the land is all our people need.

142
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,484
Our people.

143
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,653
We haven't been your people
for quite some time, son.

144
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,520
Well, I'm here now, and I have a plan.

145
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,094
But I'm running out of time.

146
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,163
It'd be nice to have your support
at the tribal council.

147
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,705
Not just as an elected official,
but as my father.

148
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,865
Oh!

149
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,406
How'd she get her pajamas on?

150
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,105
I didn't look, Mr. Logan. I swear.

151
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,886
Our partner, Geyer Enterprises, projects
that our annual share of gaming revenue...

152
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,818
...will exceed 10 million dollars.

153
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:11,825
And in five years, we'd be able to build
a hospital, along with the school.

154
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,391
But can we trust his vision?

155
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,760
Have you seen his casino?

156
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,368
We have seen the new school buildings...

157
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:24,769
...and have decided that Abooksigun may build
on the land between the casino and the river.

158
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,968
What? This is not acceptable.

159
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:32,013
Your blood cloud your vision, Hagawa?
We are not finished.

160
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,485
Abooksigun, you may expand the casino...

161
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,621
...under the condition
that you first re-examine your spirit...

162
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:43,885
...and prove yourself worthy
in the manner of your father's choosing.

163
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,695
You play redskin to the whites,
then white to your people.

164
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,232
It's just for show.

165
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,766
To show what exactly?

166
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,268
Hey, Grandma.

167
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,499
You have forced me
into a very difficult position, Mother.

168
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,734
For the good of our people.

169
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,571
Yes.

170
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,578
Hey, Lady Bug, how is the leg?

171
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,775
- It still hurts a little.
- Keep it elevated.

172
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,080
- So the swelling goes down.
- I am.

173
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,658
I have decided the manner
of your spirit quest.

174
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,125
You will return to the Creator's game.

175
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,556
Return? You mean, like, play?

176
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,792
No, you don't play.

177
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,200
Our coach quit
and I'm not a suitable replacement.

178
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,400
Well, neither am I.

179
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,133
I have a business to run.

180
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,279
Which will not expand as you wish,
unless you do as I require.

181
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,104
Dad, you know why I don't play anymore.

182
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,946
I do, and they call it
the "medicine game" for a reason.

183
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,154
Let it heal you.

184
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,185
Our next game is tomorrow,
the season ends on Memorial Day.

185
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,759
I'm only half Sunaquot,
shouldn't that mean only half a season?

186
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,859
Restore pride to our people,
and their game.

187
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,161
That is your first obligation.

188
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,861
- There's more?
- To re-examine your spirit.

189
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,066
Yeah, can you give me some
defined deliverables on that?

190
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,269
No, but I know who can.

191
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,350
Is it within my power to assign
him a spiritual advisor?

192
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,177
It is most certainly.

193
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,355
Good, then I assign you.

194
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,455
So, what? You're my babysitter now?

195
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,229
- That's howl roll, baby.
- Heh, heh.

196
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,126
Great.

197
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:41,935
<i>I like the ones who, I like the ones who
I like the ones</i>

198
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,707
<i>I like the ones who like to show me things</i>

199
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,891
Oh, man.

200
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,091
Gentlemen.

201
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,689
Look at this.

202
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:05,926
You're late.
Doesn't your fancy car have a clock?

203
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,163
- Yeah, it has GPS navigation too.
- Ugh.

204
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,272
I had to make a pit stop.

205
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,840
Man, you have a nice car here.

206
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,279
You two brothers or cousins?

207
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,572
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

208
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,442
Okay, then.

209
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:25,020
All right, you two play attack,
you three middie...

210
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,919
...you three defense,
and I guess that makes you goalie.

211
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,595
I'm your new coach.

212
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,400
Watch the cutters.

213
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,404
Go!

214
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,032
That was quick.

215
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,269
The new suit on the sideline
hasn't made a big difference for the Sunaquot.

216
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,243
Come on, guys.

217
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,482
Who's got point?

218
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,216
Reed, be aggressive!
Play your position.

219
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,761
Yeah, no, I know.
Yeah, it's a convertible.

220
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,698
You've got to hit him, Chewy!

221
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,564
Chewy, can you hit him?

222
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,263
Like you're any better, pretty boy
Why don't you step up?

223
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,999
Uh-huh. I'll be there after this game.

224
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,077
Yeah, I'll sign the check.
Just stall them, all right?

225
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,039
Hey. Unless you're Googling halftime speeches
that don't totally suck...

226
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,049
...I suggest you put that down and coach.

227
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,323
- Stay in the game, man!
- Fine.

228
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:38,188
All right, guys, they're in a zone.
Run Z82 and work it around the wings.

229
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,091
Joe, they have no idea what that means.

230
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,197
Yeah, but it sounds good.

231
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,129
Jimmy! Whoo! Over here! Yo! Yo! I'm open.

232
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,738
Ball hog! Owen was wide open.

233
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,735
- Get out.
- Z82? It's not even a real play.

234
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,070
Sounds like a radio station.

235
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,081
You, you're in,
as long as you don't hog the ball too.

236
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,443
Good luck with that.

237
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,310
Hey, who's the dorky white kid?

238
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,353
It's Toby, Dr. Gifford's son.

239
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,422
- Julie has a son?
- Oh!

240
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,685
Yeah, and he just got crushed.

241
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,020
Welcome to the club, kid.

242
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,404
<i>So how did your meeting
go with our opposition?</i>

243
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,940
How much land
are you able to deliver, Joe?

244
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,272
The council approved construction
on the land here...

245
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,847
...where the current casino is,
up to the river here.

246
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,076
Great. We will break ground next week.

247
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,149
Actually, that's where we had to make
one concession.

248
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,047
We can't go until the end of May.

249
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,589
But that's two months.

250
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,625
I know. Uh, it's an ancient tribal law.

251
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,093
What law? I thought you were my insider.

252
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,530
I am. Uh... It's, uh, called

253
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:57,605
It means "No disturb land in spring."

254
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,276
Your people didn't farm in the spring?

255
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,674
No, not really.

256
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,406
They were more hunter-gatherer,
scavenger types.

257
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,745
Like bears,
with a little bit of vulture mixed in.

258
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,253
My clan name means Vulture Bear.

259
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,760
I need a start date, Joe.

260
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,951
N ow.

261
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,496
The day after Memorial Day.

262
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:27,671
You're sure? There are no other
ancient tribal traditions I need worry about?

263
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,395
No.

264
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,103
This is from last night's reading.

265
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:38,941
"Loving that Land O' Lakes Maiden,"
by an Onondaga poet, Eric Gansworth.

266
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:44,951
<i>She is the first lesson in love for many
Indian boys, all tanned hide and feathers</i>

267
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:51,257
<i>Features straight out of Hollywood
But she lights the spark for those red boys</i>

268
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,557
<i>And probably for some
Black and white and brown ones as well</i>

269
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:03,001
<i>For anyone who learns her tricks, really
And they're not that hard to master</i>

270
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,409
So, what's this poem about?

271
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,779
That smoking-hot Indian lady
on the butter package.

272
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,978
Yes, Reed, that's clearly stated
in the title, but what else?

273
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:21,385
That smoking-hot Indian lady is a stereotype
we Native American women have to overcome.

274
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,027
We don't spread easy like butter,
we can be tough and strong.

275
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,731
Jimmy, your thoughts?

276
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,068
I think nobody cares about poetry.

277
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,329
I do. Actually I happen to love poetry.

278
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,608
Well, in that case...

279
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,234
Ooh.

280
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,779
<i>Nadie, my wounded lady
Will you marry me?</i>

281
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,646
<i>I'm strong, tough
And man enough to churn your butter nightly</i>

282
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,883
- Chewy.
- Mm.

283
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,354
- Oh!
- Ow.

284
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,911
Nice shot.
Now Maug has got another one.

285
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,777
Grandma, I'm not late today. Sis.

286
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,519
Wow.

287
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,520
All right, bring it in.

288
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,904
So that was pretty pathetic yesterday.

289
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:45,473
No focus, no fitness,
and zero team work.

290
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,769
We're gonna start over
with the fundamentals.

291
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,810
Passing and catching, line drills. Go.

292
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,811
Can't. No balls.

293
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,813
Maug's got them.

294
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,247
Okay. Who's Maug?

295
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,944
Protector of the forest.

296
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,647
Six-foot-10,
300 pounds of pure muscle.

297
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,317
Catch a deer
with his bare hands, eat it raw.

298
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,498
What you're saying is we're calling practice
on account of Sasquatch?

299
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,462
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah.

300
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,261
Works for me.

301
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,437
- How about you go buy us some more balls?
- Yeah.

302
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,871
How about you man up, Jimmy,
and go into the woods and get them yourself?

303
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,340
Ooh.

304
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,640
How about you call me Silverfoot.
How about you make me?

305
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,983
Today's lesson:

306
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,246
If you're afraid to go into the forest,
you've got no balls.

307
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,014
Oh!

308
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,383
Come on, Jimmy.

309
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,753
We ain't got no balls.
You're the one walking away.

310
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,660
Look at him, with his face buried
in that Crackberry all day.

311
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,965
So tell me then,
how's your fitness, coach?

312
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,702
You want to go? We can go.

313
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,875
Everybody. On the line.

314
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,137
Oh, come on.

315
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,511
Ready?

316
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,418
Maybe you could coach baseball.

317
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,055
Strike three. You're out.

318
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,925
Dude, Italian leather boots.

319
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,127
I'll show up if I have to,
but I can't coach these guys.

320
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,938
There's no weak warriors, Abooksigun,
only weak leaders.

321
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,667
And in this case, weak and slow.

322
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,886
There was a time
when you beat the sun, Abooksigun.

323
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,995
Crooked Arrow.

324
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,661
I hear you have returned
to the Creator's game.

325
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,528
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard why.

326
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,673
I also heard you're are O and 2.

327
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,308
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

328
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,038
These kids have had sticks
in their cradles.

329
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,643
But they're a joke right now.

330
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,910
Do you remember the story
of the eagle and the arrow?

331
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,415
No.

332
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,615
The eagle once ruled our skies.

333
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:27,194
<i>And then, one day,
he was struck down by the arrow.</i>

334
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:32,494
<i>As he lay dying,
the eagle could not understand why.</i>

335
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:39,472
The shaft of the arrow had been feathered
by one of his own plumes.

336
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,508
We often give our enemies
the means to our own defeat.

337
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,039
Look inside.

338
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,478
Ask your heart.

339
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,420
The truth may sleep, but it never dies.

340
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,357
It was only an oral language
until Hiawatha transcribed...

341
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:06,502
...the Haudenosaunee constitution
onto a wampum belt. Later, Ben Franklin...

342
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:11,101
...copied your version
of three equal branches of government.

343
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,331
Go.

344
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,535
His famous quote, "if a bunch
of ignorant savages can govern fairly...

345
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,442
...then we should be able to do the same"...

346
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,481
-...is the foundation of American democracy.
- What you want me to do?

347
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,674
Nadie?

348
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,683
- Hm?
- What's going on?

349
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,651
Uh, nothing.

350
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,323
Time for practice.

351
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:37,933
This is my classroom,
and we will stay until I say otherwise.

352
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,127
So you like your new school so much,
you want to keep the kids late?

353
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,071
Even if it means denying them the opportunity
to participate in a traditional cultural heritage?

354
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,870
Oh, well, maybe I can make it up
to them with afield trip...

355
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,742
...to go visit Chief Wampum
and his bar-dancing waitresses.

356
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,349
Speaking of which, we're hiring,
if you can dance.

357
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,349
- And she can, she was a cheerleader.
- Ooh.

358
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,954
And valedictorian,
which your coach can't even spell.

359
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,648
Well, I guess I'll just sit out here
where it's warm and sunny...

360
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,020
...with a trunk load of surprises
for the lacrosse team.

361
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,322
- Yo, are you serious?
- What? That's us. We gotta get our buddy.

362
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,663
- All right, fine.
- Whoo!

363
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,860
But we have a history test on Friday.

364
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,638
So I was thinking about what
happened when we raced.

365
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,538
- When I smoked your ass?
Ha-ha-ha.

366
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,977
I wasn't properly equipped.

367
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,910
Yeah, right.

368
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,916
We've been giving our enemies
the means to defeat us.

369
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,416
But not anymore.

370
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,890
- Reebok, best on the market.
- Oh!

371
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,923
- That's awesome.
- No way.

372
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,395
Little bang stick, 10K.

373
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,158
Look at this.

374
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,996
Look at the bag in it, man.

375
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,900
And that's not all.

376
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,464
Thank you, Marilyn.

377
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,638
Marilyn stayed up all night
making these.

378
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,880
- Oh, Jackpots.
Whoo-hoo!

379
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,818
Gotta look good to be good, right?

380
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,011
<i>That did not look good for the Jackpots.</i>

381
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,954
Despite a makeover, the Sunaquot goalie
stood planted like a tree <i>in</i> the crease...

382
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,128
<i>...insuring the loss to Sulgrave.</i>

383
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,298
<i>Today's broadcast was brought to you
by our very first sponsor...</i>

384
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,660
<i>...the Lucky Indian Casino,
where the Big Game-</i>

385
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,970
Ten dollar free play at Lucky Indian Casino.
- Joe Logan?

386
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,733
- Yeah, that's my name, just use it at the door.
- You played for Coventry in '98, right?

387
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,739
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

388
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,539
No, I played here, at Sulgrave.
Senior year you destroyed us.

389
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,682
Yeah, if you say so.

390
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,210
He's being humble.
This guy right here, the best I've ever seen.

391
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,881
You went to Syracuse, right?
They called you Logan the Legend.

392
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,823
But whatever happened
in that championship game?

393
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,762
Sorry, man, we gotta go.
Here's another coupon.

394
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,128
Congrats on the win.

395
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,398
Okay, sure.

396
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,703
Good luck!

397
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,755
<i>Logan! Logan! Logan!</i>

398
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,258
Heh. What you doing?

399
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,637
Hey! She walks.

400
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,509
I was just looking for this.

401
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,613
I've been doing a lot of driving lately and,
you know, trying to keep it fresh.

402
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,579
- Chumbawamba
- H a-h a-h a.

403
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,050
Come on, these guys were awesome
for the one song.

404
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,986
Ooh. Can I look?

405
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,888
Uh, ahem. No, not tonight.

406
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,429
Okay, total strangers
know my brother better than I do.

407
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,895
Logan the Legend?

408
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,730
I actually prefer Joey Hustle.

409
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,838
- Whatever, they're equally lame.
- Heh.

410
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,840
What was she like?

411
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,313
Strong, like you.

412
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,545
Then how could she die so young.

413
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,420
There was no hospital at the reservation.

414
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:05,383
But I can fix that now, if Dad will let me.

415
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,660
Oh, my God, is that Dr. Gifford with you?

416
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,430
Yeah, we dated at Coventry.

417
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,005
No way.

418
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,201
Yeah way.
I wouldn't bring it up to her though.

419
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,311
- Okay.
- Let's have some tunes.

420
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,708
Tunes.

421
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,940
Yeah, that's what we used to say in the '90s.

422
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,351
<i>I get knocked down, but I get up again</i>

423
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,649
Are we really gonna listen to that?
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,322
All right, guys, take your pads off.
Don't need them today.

425
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,328
What? No practice?

426
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,432
Nope. No practice.

427
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,398
Whoo
Yeah

428
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,731
- We're running.
- Ugh.

429
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,100
- Up there, to Defiance Rock.
- Ugh.

430
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:56,108
How about you drag your old butt up there
and then you can tell us all about it.

431
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,307
I'll make you a deal.

432
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,486
You give me four balls,
I'll rip all four corners with Reed in goal.

433
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,819
If I miss, I go alone.

434
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:11,084
If I hit them all, we all run.

435
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,725
- Take it.
- Take that.

436
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,759
I gotta see this.

437
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,164
Reed, you better save this, man.

438
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,103
He can't shoot.

439
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,206
- Come on, Reed.
- Come on, Reed.

440
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,379
- Ooh.
- What's that?

441
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,987
Lucky.

442
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,820
Can't you stop an old man?

443
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,004
Reed, you should have stopped that one.

444
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,182
Right here, gramps, come on.

445
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,408
- Come on, Reed.
- Come on, Reed.

446
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,934
Oh!

447
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,168
What the--?

448
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,848
- We're running.
- That was cheating.

449
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,815
- Why didn't you tell him to hit the bar?
- Why did you take that bet?

450
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,750
Come on, come on, coach!

451
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,752
Come on, Reed, get bent.

452
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,483
Guys, wait up

453
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:05,497
<i>And this one's for the fall
And this one's for the earth we never had</i>

454
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,373
What's with the stick?

455
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,982
Maug, he's here. He's everywhere, watching.

456
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:18,052
You do know that predators go
for the slowest in the herd, right?

457
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,527
Take a right at the dead tree.

458
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,951
How old does my butt look now, Jimbo?

459
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:52,777
<i>Go!</i>

460
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,019
- Whoo!
- You almost beat the sun.

461
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,169
Man, there's a reason
the white man invented cable cars.

462
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,272
Guard your tongue in youth.

463
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:16,536
And in age you may mature a thought
that will be of service to your people.

464
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,014
How long does it take you to make one?

465
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:25,051
I don't make them, the Creator does.

466
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,315
This hickory tree is older than you.

467
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:33,757
I carve away all but the heart,
leaving only power and strength.

468
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,263
Your opponent does not want
to be clubbed by one.

469
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,034
This was my great grandfather's.

470
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,805
Over 200 years old.

471
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,312
And strong as the day it was made.

472
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:56,974
But metal sticks have offset heads.
With that you'd have to cradle all the time.

473
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:01,513
Don't worry, the offset head will fit on this.

474
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:08,095
The ball lives in the offset head,
but the spirit lives in the stick.

475
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:14,329
I may be old, but I'm not out of touch
I watch ESPNU on my iPad.

476
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,499
What's this?

477
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,405
That's the Crooked Arrow,
my Sunaquot name.

478
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,911
I have made sticks and arrows
for generations.

479
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:30,517
Each one is different,
and none are perfect.

480
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,621
No arrow flies straight.

481
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,058
There's nothing wrong
with a crooked arrow.

482
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:42,621
As long as it follows its own path,
it will find its way.

483
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,496
Sticks up.

484
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:52,772
Creator gave the game to the people
of the Haudenosaunee Nation.

485
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,837
<i>They played and it pleased the Creator.</i>

486
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:04,885
Now go play the game for our ancestors
who are no longer here to entertain the Creator.

487
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,826
You put a lot of work into these.
How much do I owe you?

488
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,431
You want to repay me?

489
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,770
Return lacrosse to our people.

490
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,811
Welcome back to the rez, lacrosse fans.

491
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,577
Not that this game will qualify as lacrosse
against the beleaguered Jacked--

492
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,879
Pots.

493
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,622
- Hey, Chad.
- Hello, Nadie.

494
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,848
Yeah, we're not the Jacked Pots any more.

495
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,493
Whoo! Crooked Arrows! Yahoo!

496
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,732
And Chad?

497
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:06,142
How about you show us some respect
on our land, okay?

498
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,346
Two. We're up by two. B line get in there.

499
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,955
We're late in the third...

500
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,525
...and the newly minted Crooked Arrows
have put in a surprising effort.

501
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,594
Come on. Come on, Jimmy.

502
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,834
Head up, head up, head up. Come on.

503
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:30,965
Nice pick.

504
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,504
Yes!

505
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,514
Nice! All right, all right.

506
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,750
- That's not all right. That's not-- Jimmy!
- Whoo!

507
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,618
Hey! Hey, Silverfoot, knock it off.

508
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,083
Keep showboating.

509
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,796
Keep dancing, twinkle toes. Keep smiling.

510
00:40:56,153 --> 00:41:00,363
Yeah, you're smiling now.
You won't be smiling later.

511
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,500
Let's see some sweat, jock straps.

512
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:07,733
I'm not running a ballet here, Silvertoes,
this isn't "Dance of the Sugar Plums."

513
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,843
You want to be a ballerina,
plié off to Broadway.

514
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,809
You want to play lacrosse,
respect your team.

515
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,547
What did you guys say?

516
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,458
Hey, hey! Guys, guys, break it up, okay?
Come on.

517
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,456
No secrets now, we're a team.

518
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,151
We all speak the same language.

519
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,761
- Keep them running till I get back.
- Okay. Ready?

520
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,639
Keeping office hours, Dr. Gifford?

521
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,107
I need Jimmy when you're through with him.

522
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:51,480
We've got a problem with him graduating.
He's failing English.

523
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,985
You know, I always thought
you'd be a teacher.

524
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,988
Location is a bit of a surprise.

525
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:01,588
Your people made quite an impression
on me, coach.

526
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,193
Did you know that Jimmy
doesn't understand a word of Sunaquot?

527
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,632
A lot of kids don't learn it these days.

528
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,831
Well, I think they should.

529
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,608
And why would that matter to you?

530
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:20,407
We're reconnecting with our heritage.

531
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,511
Really?

532
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,881
Okay, what do you have in mind?

533
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:38,231
"Motion, reverse, zone, V-cut, crease"
and "hit me I'm open"?

534
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:42,461
The Unishees use Sunaquot on the field.
I think it could give the team a big advantage.

535
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,677
Well, yes, Julie, I will have
dinner with you this evening.

536
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:56,246
Joe, when you can ask me
in your native tongue...

537
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,149
...l'd be glad to help
for the sake of my students.

538
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,487
Including the ones who just puked.

539
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,695
<i>AH</i> this time <i>I</i> thought <i>I</i> was wasting

540
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:14,165
<i>But you've gone and saved me
And now I can breathe again</i>

541
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,702
<i>You're bringing me back to life</i>

542
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,644
You're supposed to meet with Dr. Gifford
today about your test.

543
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,686
Why do you care?

544
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,324
Because if you flunk out, you can't play.

545
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:47,297
You know, Jimmy,
I'm trying to do something special here.

546
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,994
Provide our people with a little hope.

547
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,599
But to do that, I need to win games.

548
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,301
And to do that, I need you.

549
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:03,548
Why bother?

550
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,314
To honor our people,
make lacrosse matter again.

551
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,386
Look, together we can turn things
around here in a big way.

552
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,793
But for that to happen,
I need you to be a leader, a team player.

553
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,262
I need a captain, Jimmy.

554
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,265
I'm already captain.

555
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,165
Prove it.

556
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,609
You can start by passing the ball.

557
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:39,281
Hey. He was a ball hog at your age.

558
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,849
Still a show boater.

559
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,375
All right, guys.
I've translated the plays into Sunaquot.

560
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,849
And like the Navajo code talkers
in World War ll...

561
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,789
...we'll confuse the hell out of our enemies.

562
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,958
You two help with pronunciation, please.

563
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:22,923
Really?

564
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,657
What you have here for V-cut, vagi--

565
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:31,807
Uh, actually kind of means like a woman's--
You know?

566
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,770
- What?
- Let me see.

567
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,534
Oh, my God, Joe, he's right.

568
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,474
I got this from a very good source.

569
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:41,241
Well, something got lost in translation,
like maybe tact.

570
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,347
Just fix it, Sammy, okay?

571
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,310
Hello?

572
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,782
You must be Sasquatch.

573
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,718
Maug.-

574
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:58,621
I'm Joe, the new coach.

575
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,454
Hardly.

576
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,831
I guess you've been watching.
Crooked Arrow says you can play.

577
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,867
You can see that we could use
some help on defense.

578
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,061
No, I'm busy.

579
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:18,436
Well, you could help us win.
Be a part of the team.

580
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,444
Feel the pride.

581
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,180
Meet some girls.

582
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,746
Hit rich boys as hard as you want?

583
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,498
- Did I get it right?
- No. It's not a trapezoid.

584
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,099
Yes, it is.

585
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:44,864
Hi. Sorry to interrupt, but I'd like
to introduce you to your new classmate.

586
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:48,066
This is Maug.

587
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,248
I made him get dressed for class.

588
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,112
- Why?
Ha-ha-ha.

589
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,377
Well, welcome, Maug.

590
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,353
He's amazing.

591
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:11,959
Is it true you can catch a deer,
kill it with your bare hands and eat it raw?

592
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,765
Chill, bro, I'm vegan.

593
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,345
Crooked Arrows
showing some aggression, finally!

594
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,019
Another turnover caused by Maug!

595
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,587
This new guy is a hammer.

596
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,314
Come on, guys, set it up! Let's run it.

597
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,685
Come on, Jimmy.

598
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,623
And the Crooked Arrows
are on offense again!

599
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:41,818
Drop in, drop in.

600
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,095
Find the pass.

601
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:57,109
Jimmy Silverfoot sets it up.
Passes it to Sammy or is that Owen?

602
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:04,652
Fakes low, fires high, and goal!
It's tie score late in the fourth.

603
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:07,219
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. Watch the feet.

604
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:11,052
Hey, hey, hey, act like we've been
here before, boys. Come on, let's go.

605
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:14,491
Amazing improvement
since Joe Logan took over.

606
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:15,857
Time out, sir, time out.

607
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:21,201
Dooley is in a battle, and the
Crooked Arrows are on target for their first win.

608
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,528
Toby, you're in.

609
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,036
Me?

610
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,401
Ah! Yes!

611
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,543
Come on, just be aggressive, buddy.

612
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,435
Whoo!

613
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,774
All right, guys, come on in. A minute left.

614
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,180
Okay, Lyle, take a breather.
Toby, you're in at middie.

615
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:38,876
- What?
- What?

616
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,521
Sticks up.

617
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,589
Come on, guys, it's tied.
We can win this.

618
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,852
Come on, boys! Let's do this.
Crooked Arrows on three. One, two, three!

619
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,155
Crooked Arrows! Whoo! Whoo!

620
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,695
You're on wing, Toby.

621
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:59,931
Toby, on the wing. On the wing.

622
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:05,739
Now coming off the bench for the
Crooked Arrows, number 12, Toby Gifford.

623
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,554
Watch the double team.

624
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,791
Hey, here! Over here! Here!

625
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,727
Look Toby! Look Toby! Look Toby!

626
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,665
Come on, Toby.

627
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,663
And he drops it.

628
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,641
Come on!

629
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,444
Hudson to Thomas.

630
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,589
Reed, clear crease!
Clear crease, Reed!

631
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,425
And it's in!

632
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:56,587
Dooley pulls out a stunning victory
after a crushing Crooked Arrows turnover.

633
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,630
What a game!

634
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:02,599
The Arrows are still winless
for the season.

635
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,035
How come their white boys can play?

636
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,301
- Lay off, Jimmy.
- Why was he even out there?

637
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:12,412
He's out there
because he's a member of this team.

638
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,684
We win and lose together
and nobody played perfectly.

639
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:25,223
But, hey, you guys played a great game, okay?
We'll get the next one.

640
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,386
So tonight,
steak dinner on me, all right?

641
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,995
I'm getting two steaks.

642
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,669
- How about a lap dance?
- You don't have a lap, honey.

643
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,670
Ooh.

644
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,208
- Thanks, Marilyn.
- You're welcome.

645
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:49,680
The hawk feather has long been
a sign of service for our people.

646
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:53,013
Warriors could earn feathers
on the field of battle.

647
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:58,387
Soto Jimmy, for winning
three face-offs and notching two assists.

648
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:02,052
To the Unishees, great speed, great effort.

649
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,596
And one goal apiece.

650
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,326
To Chewy, for tough position defense.

651
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:12,063
And to Maug, for creating four turnovers.

652
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:16,039
And to Nadie, for our motion offense.

653
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,611
I plan to make this a tradition
after every game.

654
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,681
So give ourselves a hand.

655
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:41,759
Hey.</i>

656
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,336
Listen, I know you're in a tough spot here.

657
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:45,734
I've been there.

658
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:49,934
The only poor Sunaquot kid
at a fancy prep school.

659
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,872
You didn't suck.

660
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,845
You know how you get over it?

661
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:01,381
Take the next shot you have.

662
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:04,559
And I'll make sure
you get another chance, okay?

663
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,857
Thanks, coach.

664
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,733
Hey, Mom.

665
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:26,107
Was that a little bit of Sunaquot
on the field today, coach?

666
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,815
I told you, we're working cultural identity
into the game plan.

667
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,513
Uh-huh. A little bit of a loose translation,
don't you think?

668
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,955
Yeah, well, kids kind of made it their own.

669
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:45,259
Which is why I will be working some proper
Sunaquot into my lesson plan this week.

670
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,864
See you later.

671
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,140
Night.

672
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:12,156
You have been given knowledge and tools.

673
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,762
<i>But now, you must commit yourselves
to the Creator's game.</i>

674
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,929
To the ancient game that began long ago...

675
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:22,501
...when the birds
first played against the animals.

676
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:32,946
However, you must first accept who you are.

677
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:41,111
<i>Within each one of us
resides an animal spirit.</i>

678
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:46,590
<i>You must go on a vision quest
to discover your animal spirit.</i>

679
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:52,264
Actually, sweating kind of makes me
break out, so can I--? Ow!

680
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,400
<i>When the animals of the sky played
the first game against the animals of the land...</i>

681
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:06,809
<i>...the Creator gave a gift
to every creature.</i>

682
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,607
Tell me your vision.

683
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,721
The deer.

684
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:19,018
A spirit of speed and agility.

685
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:22,958
<i>Tell me your vision.</i>

686
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,360
The bear.

687
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,537
Great strength.

688
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,170
The wolf.

689
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,940
Became ferocious and wild.

690
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:41,006
<i>The turtle</i>

691
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:45,384
Was able to withstand any blow.

692
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,350
The hawk.

693
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:52,650
The birds were gifted
with flight and swift movement.

694
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,658
<i>The raven.</i>

695
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,132
<i>And even the smallest animal...</i>

696
00:55:58,955 --> 00:55:59,956
The squirrel.

697
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:03,137
...would prove his worth to the Creator.

698
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:09,066
This is good. In one team you represent
both the animals and the birds.

699
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:13,611
It is said that our loved ones
return as birds to watch over us.

700
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:19,653
So for you, Abooksigun, the eagle.

701
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,754
May your mother's wings lift you up.

702
00:56:27,814 --> 00:56:30,124
All right, everybody, we're gonna
do a friendship dance now.

703
00:56:30,316 --> 00:56:31,795
So, ladies, grab a man.

704
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:54,277
So things are looking up around here.
What do you think?

705
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:56,954
Will we be ready to build
at the end of the season?

706
00:56:57,143 --> 00:56:59,145
Ah, that's yet to be seen.

707
00:57:02,248 --> 00:57:04,489
You don't answer to only me
in this quest, Joe.

708
00:57:06,052 --> 00:57:08,225
But to your ancestors.

709
00:57:08,955 --> 00:57:14,371
Grandma Skye tells me you come a long ways,
but there's more to your journey.

710
00:57:15,495 --> 00:57:17,805
Step up, step up, Reed!

711
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:21,911
Poor goalie play has plagued them again
thanks to Reed "The Colander" Armstrong.

712
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:24,809
I've never been very good
with nicknames.

713
00:57:25,004 --> 00:57:27,780
Anyway, along pass across the field.

714
00:57:29,075 --> 00:57:30,645
Hit him!

715
00:57:34,547 --> 00:57:35,651
Time out, sir.

716
00:57:35,848 --> 00:57:40,092
Marston Hall climbs within one, 14-13.

717
00:57:40,286 --> 00:57:42,527
Reed, come on, I've seen kittens
more aggressive than you.

718
00:57:42,722 --> 00:57:44,702
No, no, no, Joe, wait. Look.

719
00:57:45,858 --> 00:57:48,031
Reed, you better man up
and clear the freaking crease.

720
00:57:48,227 --> 00:57:51,003
Okay, you hold onto this lead, or I swear...

721
00:57:51,197 --> 00:57:55,475
...I will shove those feathers
so far up your asses, you'll fly.

722
00:57:55,668 --> 00:57:57,238
Okay, me first.

723
00:57:57,703 --> 00:57:59,205
- Sticks up.
- Come on, boys.

724
00:57:59,405 --> 00:58:04,013
I mean, I like your hair and your body is tight,
but you play goalie like a wussy.

725
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:09,216
And that is so un-hot. We straight?

726
00:58:09,415 --> 00:58:10,826
Yeah, we're straight.

727
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,695
Reed, buddy!

728
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:17,663
I got this, coach, okay?

729
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:18,927
All right.

730
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:23,101
Ten seconds left,
Marston on a break, looking to tie.

731
00:58:23,296 --> 00:58:25,105
Baird breaks free, right wing.

732
00:58:25,298 --> 00:58:26,504
Watch the cutter!

733
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:29,340
Too far! Too far, Reed!

734
00:58:29,902 --> 00:58:31,210
Ah!

735
00:58:32,238 --> 00:58:34,718
It's over! The Crooked Arrows win.

736
00:58:34,907 --> 00:58:35,908
Yes!

737
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:39,753
The Crooked Arrows get their first win
of the season...

738
00:58:39,944 --> 00:58:42,322
...with Reed coming out of the crease
to make the play.

739
00:58:45,683 --> 00:58:46,957
Now that's bringing it home, son.

740
00:58:47,151 --> 00:58:49,563
Just when you think you're not
getting through to these kids.

741
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:53,725
Don't you take credit for that.
You didn't do that. Booty did that.

742
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:56,933
Pfft. What?

743
00:58:57,461 --> 00:58:59,964
Whoo!
- Ha, ha!

744
00:59:00,164 --> 00:59:03,168
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

745
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:04,903
I get knocked down, but I get up again

746
00:59:05,102 --> 00:59:06,979
Reed, for making 10 saves.

747
00:59:07,171 --> 00:59:09,913
The Crooked Arrows are flying true
of late, hitting only bull's-eyes.

748
00:59:10,107 --> 00:59:12,917
Taking rematch wins against
St. Giles, Locke and Sulgrave.

749
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,387
Sweeping Dooley and blowing out
the lowly Bernard Forest twice.

750
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,389
They're flying out there.

751
00:59:18,582 --> 00:59:22,587
The fleet-footed Unishee brothers, Owen
and Sammy, must read each other's minds...

752
00:59:22,787 --> 00:59:24,994
...their passes are so perfect.

753
00:59:26,557 --> 00:59:31,302
Two months ago, no one could have imagined
Joe Logan would take the lowest ranking team...

754
00:59:31,495 --> 00:59:35,409
...in the New York Prep League
on a path towards the playoffs.

755
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,638
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

756
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:41,510
Another turnover.

757
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:44,448
- Move like the wind! Run!
- Yeah, Chewy!

758
00:59:44,642 --> 00:59:47,646
- And yes!
- Whoo!

759
00:59:48,212 --> 00:59:50,089
Chewy, great steal.

760
00:59:51,115 --> 00:59:54,358
Another win for the Crooked Arrows.

761
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:57,158
Silverfoot scores!

762
00:59:58,089 --> 00:59:59,898
The Arrows run a tight-motion offense.

763
01:00:00,091 --> 01:00:03,129
This team is hot,
and I don't just mean their assistant coach.

764
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:17,410
The Sunaquot team is moving up
the ranks at a breakneck pace.

765
01:00:17,608 --> 01:00:23,490
An unprecedented turnaround.
It's a Maug attack!

766
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:25,850
They weren't ready for that, were they?

767
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:27,586
Hello.

768
01:00:29,153 --> 01:00:30,154
Whoo!

769
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:35,094
After six straight wins, the Crooked
Arrows are getting state-wide attention.

770
01:00:35,526 --> 01:00:40,635
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

771
01:00:45,803 --> 01:00:46,975
Yeah, good.

772
01:00:48,606 --> 01:00:50,051
Ha-ha-ha. No.

773
01:00:55,646 --> 01:00:57,148
Joe Logan has his boys believing.

774
01:00:57,348 --> 01:00:59,692
They're passionate and driven,
but they'll have to ambush...

775
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:02,694
...undefeated Coventry on the road
in order to make the playoffs.

776
01:01:02,887 --> 01:01:06,232
And that's a very tall order,
even for Logan the Legend.

777
01:01:14,265 --> 01:01:20,773
Two hundred thousand square feet,
500 rooms, 3000 slots, 150 tables.

778
01:01:20,971 --> 01:01:22,917
A 1000-seat performance theater...

779
01:01:23,107 --> 01:01:29,752
...36-hole PGA golf course,
and the first Native Adventures theme park.

780
01:01:30,714 --> 01:01:36,027
Mr. Geyer, this is 10 times bigger
than what we discussed.

781
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:41,568
Because with your plan,
your people merely survive.

782
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:47,835
But with mine, they actually get rich.
You, chief among them.

783
01:01:48,032 --> 01:01:52,071
We're talking $100 million a year.

784
01:01:54,705 --> 01:01:59,313
This is not what I agreed to
with the council.

785
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,491
Once the money starts to flow,
they'll forget all about it.

786
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,217
No, no, we had a deal. We had a deal.

787
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,293
And I changed it.

788
01:02:09,153 --> 01:02:10,791
Trust me.

789
01:02:11,956 --> 01:02:15,199
You will be a hero to your people.

790
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:19,035
Once we break ground tomorrow.

791
01:02:20,564 --> 01:02:21,736
Tomorrow?

792
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:24,203
Day after Memorial Day.

793
01:02:28,772 --> 01:02:31,412
Welcome to Coventry Academy
and The Bowl.

794
01:02:31,609 --> 01:02:35,614
This is the unquestioned seat
of prep lacrosse glory.

795
01:02:35,813 --> 01:02:40,887
No love lost today. The last time these two
teams met, Coventry annihilated the Sunaquot...

796
01:02:41,085 --> 01:02:42,860
...and the game ended in a brawl.

797
01:02:43,053 --> 01:02:45,363
A lot has changed since then
for the Crooked Arrows.

798
01:02:45,556 --> 01:02:48,332
But they still need a win if they're
going to make it to the postseason.

799
01:02:48,526 --> 01:02:52,599
And it's going to take a monumental effort
to overcome the storied men in blue.

800
01:02:52,796 --> 01:02:56,608
Gentlemen, you ever wonder why there's
no '98 championship banner here?

801
01:02:57,401 --> 01:03:02,111
Logan the Legend choked.
Let's make sure that happens again.

802
01:03:07,811 --> 01:03:10,018
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

803
01:03:10,214 --> 01:03:12,023
For getting blood on your only uniform.

804
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,227
Down! Set!

805
01:03:17,621 --> 01:03:20,602
Watson wins the draw. Off to Dawes.

806
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:23,465
And it looks like practice out there.

807
01:03:31,802 --> 01:03:34,806
Fancy stick work, a lot of hot-dogging.

808
01:03:35,005 --> 01:03:36,746
Coventry goes up one-zip.

809
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:39,751
The high-flying Arrows
have quickly fallen back to earth.

810
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:42,220
Hey, Arrows, how's that for stick work?

811
01:03:49,653 --> 01:03:51,690
Coventry seals up another
undefeated season...

812
01:03:51,889 --> 01:03:55,996
...and enters the playoffs as the number one
seed with a dominant 12-5 victory.

813
01:03:56,193 --> 01:03:59,936
Coventry is stuffing the Arrows
back in the quiver.

814
01:04:01,165 --> 01:04:03,702
They'll miss the playoffs again this year.

815
01:04:07,738 --> 01:04:10,014
Yo, did you hear?
Marston lost and now we get a bye.

816
01:04:10,207 --> 01:04:13,188
Nice. Who we got here?

817
01:04:14,878 --> 01:04:19,088
You know, now that your season is over,
you can finally get with a winner.

818
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:21,229
Marston lost?

819
01:04:22,987 --> 01:04:25,058
Marston lost!

820
01:04:26,223 --> 01:04:28,328
Guys, Bernard upset Marston.

821
01:04:28,892 --> 01:04:32,465
- Who cares?
- You do, we beat Bernard twice.

822
01:04:32,663 --> 01:04:35,200
That means we're in the playoffs.

823
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,312
Whoo!

824
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:39,538
We're in the playoffs!

825
01:05:23,514 --> 01:05:25,152
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

826
01:05:25,349 --> 01:05:26,487
Whoa, what's u p?

827
01:05:26,984 --> 01:05:28,463
Check this out.

828
01:05:30,688 --> 01:05:32,668
Coach, what's going on?

829
01:05:54,111 --> 01:05:55,818
How is this possible?

830
01:05:56,013 --> 01:05:57,492
Geyer needed a start date.

831
01:05:57,681 --> 01:06:00,719
The season ended today,
so I gave him one.

832
01:06:00,918 --> 01:06:02,591
But it didn't end today.

833
01:06:02,786 --> 01:06:06,324
What? You just thought we
wouldn't make it to the playoffs?

834
01:06:06,523 --> 01:06:08,901
No, not two months ago.

835
01:06:09,093 --> 01:06:10,731
Two months ago?

836
01:06:10,928 --> 01:06:14,239
The council was clear. I was clear.

837
01:06:14,431 --> 01:06:16,843
And you have not met
all my requirements, son.

838
01:06:17,034 --> 01:06:20,413
Look, this team couldn't win
a game before I took over.

839
01:06:20,604 --> 01:06:24,279
It's been a great season.
Pride has been restored, like you wanted.

840
01:06:24,475 --> 01:06:28,753
I've done everything that you've asked of me.
Why can't you just be happy for once?

841
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:40,229
The lacrosse field
was not part of the plan.

842
01:06:41,925 --> 01:06:45,270
I know, but the plan changed.

843
01:06:46,363 --> 01:06:47,364
And...

844
01:06:47,965 --> 01:06:50,878
...we don't need a lacrosse field
for the rest of the season.

845
01:06:53,403 --> 01:06:57,874
Last-seeded teams don't play home games.
I can still coach, it's a win-win.

846
01:06:58,075 --> 01:07:01,284
For you, but what happened
to honoring our people?

847
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:05,960
You're not our coach,
you're a liar and a hypocrite.

848
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:08,623
Let's go.

849
01:07:12,623 --> 01:07:14,432
Nadie...

850
01:07:46,323 --> 01:07:51,397
Abooksigun led our team to a winning record
and reawakened our traditions within them.

851
01:07:51,595 --> 01:07:54,474
Our people were very inspired
by his efforts.

852
01:07:54,665 --> 01:07:57,407
Because we fear losing the casino
if we delay...

853
01:07:57,601 --> 01:08:01,515
...we declare that Abooksigun
has fulfilled his obligation...

854
01:08:01,705 --> 01:08:04,515
...and may proceed
using the new land he requested.

855
01:08:05,943 --> 01:08:08,787
That field is as old as our people.

856
01:08:11,715 --> 01:08:14,218
The return of his spirit
was to be decided by me.

857
01:08:14,418 --> 01:08:17,956
It was a difficult decision,
but the council has spoken.

858
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:32,906
I'm sorry that it happened this way, Dad.

859
01:08:33,103 --> 01:08:38,280
But it's time to move forward
and this is good for everybody.

860
01:08:38,942 --> 01:08:42,549
You are my son, and I love you.

861
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,189
But the future of our people
rests in your hands.

862
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:50,888
And I fear that your spirit
is not strong enough to protect us.

863
01:09:31,194 --> 01:09:37,475
Hey, Wampum, spot me a fortune feather,
will you? I'm down big here.

864
01:09:39,803 --> 01:09:41,805
Yeah? Me too.

865
01:10:25,048 --> 01:10:27,995
More troubles you than what I know.

866
01:10:30,053 --> 01:10:33,523
I think I may have feathered the arrow
for our enemy.

867
01:10:36,259 --> 01:10:38,569
Yet the eagle still flies.

868
01:10:39,763 --> 01:10:41,765
There is still time.

869
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:49,245
But remember, a wise warrior forces his enemy
to fight at a time and place of his choosing.

870
01:11:05,455 --> 01:11:08,026
Don't try to pin me down

871
01:11:08,225 --> 01:11:11,035
I'm a contradiction

872
01:11:11,228 --> 01:11:13,139
Love, hate, get it straight

873
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:15,776
Half devil, half divine

874
01:11:18,902 --> 01:11:20,142
What?

875
01:11:20,337 --> 01:11:21,645
I'm here to talk to you.

876
01:11:23,407 --> 01:11:25,318
Great, talk all you want.

877
01:11:25,509 --> 01:11:27,989
Believe

878
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:33,523
I get what I want, not just what I-

879
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:38,925
You want to know howl lost
the state championship?

880
01:11:39,689 --> 01:11:41,828
See number 12? That's Emmitt...

881
01:11:42,025 --> 01:11:47,065
...the current coach of Coventry,
and he's pointing at me, number 17.

882
01:11:47,264 --> 01:11:49,608
There were 15 seconds left and the call...

883
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,246
...was for me to come off a screen,
work to the crease.

884
01:11:53,203 --> 01:11:55,183
I could have hit that shot in my sleep.

885
01:11:55,372 --> 01:12:01,721
But I was the guy who choked
and lost the championship.

886
01:12:08,151 --> 01:12:11,496
See? Everyone is devastated by my miss.

887
01:12:15,425 --> 01:12:19,430
But I'm just heading to the showers.

888
01:12:26,803 --> 01:12:28,942
You missed on purpose.

889
01:12:30,774 --> 01:12:32,651
I was tired of winning for them.

890
01:12:32,843 --> 01:12:35,050
Felt like I was being used.

891
01:12:35,846 --> 01:12:40,386
For three years,
Coventry cheered every score.

892
01:12:40,584 --> 01:12:44,054
They loved me
when I was helping them win...

893
01:12:44,254 --> 01:12:49,363
...but the rest of the school day
I was invisible.

894
01:12:50,861 --> 01:12:53,467
Julie was the only one
who could see me for more...

895
01:12:53,663 --> 01:12:56,473
...than just a poor kid
who could play lacrosse.

896
01:12:57,601 --> 01:13:01,344
And to her, the Sunaquot were more...

897
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:06,382
...than some Indians on a reservation,
you know?

898
01:13:07,344 --> 01:13:09,654
Losing wasn't the problem.

899
01:13:11,848 --> 01:13:14,021
I dishonored the game.

900
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:18,996
And I've done it again.

901
01:13:20,457 --> 01:13:22,403
Okay, then fix it.

902
01:13:23,593 --> 01:13:25,300
Why do you think I'm here?

903
01:13:26,863 --> 01:13:29,707
Let me be your assistant, coach.

904
01:13:30,967 --> 01:13:33,447
Mm. Tsk.

905
01:13:42,746 --> 01:13:44,953
Now coached
by young Nadie Logan and her father...

906
01:13:45,148 --> 01:13:48,288
...the Crooked Arrows
take down Montross and win in round one.

907
01:13:48,485 --> 01:13:49,759
But where is Joey Hustle?

908
01:13:49,953 --> 01:13:53,400
Shake it for the war chief all night long

909
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:55,399
Rattlebone

910
01:13:55,859 --> 01:13:57,532
Rattlebone

911
01:13:57,727 --> 01:14:01,174
Sweet medicine
To each his own

912
01:14:01,364 --> 01:14:05,471
Billy, hey, can I see that?
We've got a change.

913
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:07,512
Mr. Geyer wants this done ASAP.

914
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:09,740
Whatever, your money, boss.

915
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,283
Yes, it is.

916
01:14:11,474 --> 01:14:13,681
One earth below

917
01:14:15,445 --> 01:14:17,584
One earth below

918
01:15:22,512 --> 01:15:24,082
Hm?
- Ha-ha-ha.

919
01:15:41,564 --> 01:15:42,907
Good job, Chewy!

920
01:15:43,099 --> 01:15:44,703
Despite Joe Logan's absence...

921
01:15:44,901 --> 01:15:48,246
...the Arrows are displaying
a vast arsenal of motion-offense plays...

922
01:15:48,438 --> 01:15:50,884
...inspired by native box lacrosse.

923
01:15:51,074 --> 01:15:54,453
Not to be denied a date with destiny,
the Crooked Arrows have ripped through...

924
01:15:54,644 --> 01:15:58,421
...the best lacrosse teams in New York,
including the Dooley Devils.

925
01:15:58,915 --> 01:16:00,553
Can you believe it?

926
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:04,357
The Sunaquot are heading to the state finals
and guess who they'll face.

927
01:16:04,554 --> 01:16:06,830
You know who,
they who shall not be named.

928
01:16:07,023 --> 01:16:08,832
Can the Arrows pull off one more miracle?

929
01:16:09,025 --> 01:16:11,801
Doubtful, but I for one sure do hope so.

930
01:16:12,162 --> 01:16:13,698
- Toby, get up here.
- Toby.

931
01:16:13,897 --> 01:16:16,605
- Get up here.
- Get water, man.

932
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:23,180
Oh!

933
01:16:23,373 --> 01:16:24,613
Wow.

934
01:16:32,582 --> 01:16:34,528
Sprinkler systems are in order.

935
01:16:34,718 --> 01:16:36,857
We've got the same grass
they use at Yankee Stadium.

936
01:16:37,087 --> 01:16:40,660
Oh.
- Wait, you know I can't stand the Yankees.

937
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,332
Eh...

938
01:16:51,434 --> 01:16:53,937
Well done, Abooksigun.

939
01:16:54,137 --> 01:16:55,639
It's as it should be.

940
01:16:57,173 --> 01:16:58,709
We got our coach back.

941
01:17:09,919 --> 01:17:11,557
Hey, coach!

942
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:14,629
Thanks, sis.

943
01:17:16,192 --> 01:17:18,172
All right, let's get to it.

944
01:17:18,361 --> 01:17:20,534
Let's go, boys, let's go.

945
01:17:22,966 --> 01:17:24,946
Louie, look over here.

946
01:17:25,135 --> 01:17:27,012
MAN 2;
All right.

947
01:17:27,203 --> 01:17:29,046
We're gonna miss the game.

948
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:31,783
Not if you two hurry up
and get the new name up.

949
01:17:31,975 --> 01:17:33,386
There you go.

950
01:17:39,749 --> 01:17:44,027
Welcome back to The Bowl on this
beautiful day for championship lacrosse.

951
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:48,767
This title game features familiar foes
and a battle of tradition.

952
01:17:50,326 --> 01:17:53,967
The Sunaquot, representing the creators
of the ancient game.

953
01:17:54,164 --> 01:17:56,906
And Coventry Academy,
the modern juggernaut that has perfected it.

954
01:17:59,202 --> 01:18:02,945
Good afternoon, everyone,
on a beautiful day here in upstate New York.

955
01:18:03,373 --> 01:18:05,410
I'm Sean McDonough,
delighted to have you with us.

956
01:18:05,608 --> 01:18:09,715
What brings ESPN to a state
high school lacrosse championship game?

957
01:18:09,913 --> 01:18:14,123
Well, America's fastest-growing sport
has spawned an amazing story...

958
01:18:15,185 --> 01:18:17,961
...about a Native American team
called the Crooked Arrows.

959
01:18:18,154 --> 01:18:20,327
After a miserable 0-5 start to their season...

960
01:18:20,523 --> 01:18:23,470
...they changed coaches
and brought in Joe Logan.

961
01:18:24,727 --> 01:18:29,005
These young men were on an unlikely
winning streak that lasted until the final day...

962
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:32,840
...of their regular season,
when they lost to undefeated Coventry.

963
01:18:33,036 --> 01:18:36,245
In a surprising twist of fate, the Arrows
have marched through the playoffs...

964
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:37,816
...to set up another meeting.

965
01:18:38,007 --> 01:18:43,480
It's therefore no surprise that the lacrosse elite
have turned out to witness this epic showdown.

966
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,852
Among those in attendance...

967
01:18:45,048 --> 01:18:48,860
...professional lacrosse stars
Paul Rabil, Zack Greer and Brody Merrill.

968
01:18:49,052 --> 01:18:52,124
And at the end of the field,
some of the sport's legendary coaches...

969
01:18:52,322 --> 01:18:56,464
...including John Desko of Syracuse
and Virginia's Dom Starga.

970
01:18:56,659 --> 01:19:00,869
Amidst all this excitement,
will Big Blue win another championship?

971
01:19:01,064 --> 01:19:03,635
Or is this the day David slays Goliath?

972
01:19:04,767 --> 01:19:07,805
Stay tuned, the game starts in just a moment.

973
01:19:10,006 --> 01:19:12,748
Hey, isn't that your boss?

974
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,990
Hey, Joe!

975
01:19:16,179 --> 01:19:17,715
Mr. Geyer.

976
01:19:17,914 --> 01:19:19,894
Big game, huh?

977
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:22,689
Saw you made some unplanned renovations.

978
01:19:22,886 --> 01:19:28,495
But I was wondering why my crew
and my equipment are sitting idle.

979
01:19:28,691 --> 01:19:31,900
Well, you know when you asked if there
were any other ancient tribal traditions...

980
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,905
-...that might get in your way?
- Yes.

981
01:19:35,098 --> 01:19:37,476
Well, this game is one I forgot about...

982
01:19:37,934 --> 01:19:41,746
...so we'll be keeping that land
for our lacrosse field.

983
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:45,977
- Joe, we have a deal.
- No, we had a deal. You changed it.

984
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,916
I just changed it back.

985
01:19:48,111 --> 01:19:52,150
There are a lot of other rich developers
out there looking for wasted land.

986
01:19:52,649 --> 01:19:54,856
I'll sue.

987
01:19:55,818 --> 01:19:57,229
In what court?

988
01:19:59,122 --> 01:20:01,102
We're a sovereign nation.

989
01:20:08,498 --> 01:20:10,842
Your laws don't apply on our land.

990
01:20:12,235 --> 01:20:14,476
I have a game to coach.

991
01:20:22,245 --> 01:20:24,623
One, two, three, Crooked Arrows! Whoo!

992
01:20:26,049 --> 01:20:27,995
Hey, let them have the face-off.

993
01:20:28,184 --> 01:20:29,458
No way, I can take this punk.

994
01:20:29,652 --> 01:20:31,825
Silverfoot, trust me, okay?

995
01:20:32,021 --> 01:20:34,900
Face-off man is gonna clamp
and put it between his legs to the middie.

996
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:38,595
Maug is gonna leave his man
and cover the other wing. Go!

997
01:20:41,464 --> 01:20:42,772
Whoo!

998
01:20:45,835 --> 01:20:48,213
Arrows won't work
against body armor and machine guns.

999
01:20:48,404 --> 01:20:50,077
All it takes is one good shot.

1000
01:20:50,273 --> 01:20:51,513
Down!

1001
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:53,187
Trust me, Jimmy.

1002
01:20:53,376 --> 01:20:54,946
Set!

1003
01:20:56,813 --> 01:21:00,386
Watson wins the opening draw,
a set play as he dishes and dashes.

1004
01:21:02,819 --> 01:21:03,820
Yes, nice hit, Maug!

1005
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:10,634
Look at the point man, he's open!

1006
01:21:15,298 --> 01:21:17,209
Sammy, nice finish!

1007
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,813
The Crooked Arrows strike first,
quieting this capacity crowd in blue.

1008
01:21:21,804 --> 01:21:24,546
When did the Indians
start playing lacrosse anyway?

1009
01:21:27,977 --> 01:21:30,685
Way to start off the game.
Give me a second line, let's go!

1010
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,690
Like I said, one good shot.

1011
01:21:33,883 --> 01:21:36,261
I remember when I scored my first goal.

1012
01:21:42,392 --> 01:21:43,837
Put a body on him, Chewy!

1013
01:21:44,027 --> 01:21:46,564
Get in front of him, Chewy, come on!

1014
01:21:53,336 --> 01:21:55,714
That's what I'm talking about.
Just like we drew it up, baby.

1015
01:21:55,905 --> 01:21:57,441
- Just like we drew it up.
- Whoo!

1016
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,382
All right, guys, come on.
We'll get it back.

1017
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:04,888
And after getting punched
in the nose, the empire strikes back!

1018
01:22:06,015 --> 01:22:10,361
Come on, take it away top side!
Who's hot? Slide! Slide!

1019
01:22:13,589 --> 01:22:15,591
Two to one, we got them
right where we want them.

1020
01:22:15,792 --> 01:22:18,238
Great shot by Watson. Two to one Coventry.

1021
01:22:18,428 --> 01:22:20,908
And when they get a lead,
they rarely give it back.

1022
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:24,211
Slide!

1023
01:22:24,634 --> 01:22:26,113
Goal!

1024
01:22:29,839 --> 01:22:33,184
- Come on, guys, regroup! Regroup!
- Fast break!

1025
01:22:37,847 --> 01:22:41,226
Coventry Academy
putting on a clinic here at The Bowl.

1026
01:22:42,819 --> 01:22:46,266
It's just too much for the Arrows
on both ends of the field.

1027
01:22:47,423 --> 01:22:49,460
No letup, blue line, no letup!

1028
01:22:49,659 --> 01:22:51,639
Good hustle!

1029
01:22:54,063 --> 01:22:56,043
No mercy!

1030
01:23:00,169 --> 01:23:03,241
It's getting contentious down on the field.

1031
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:05,009
Get in the hole.

1032
01:23:07,877 --> 01:23:09,151
Come on, way to be, way to be.

1033
01:23:09,345 --> 01:23:10,915
And another turnover!

1034
01:23:12,582 --> 01:23:14,255
- Yes!
- Whoo!

1035
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:19,122
Run Skada! Run Skada!

1036
01:23:22,191 --> 01:23:25,070
And Dawes just got away with an
obvious hold and the Arrows come up short.

1037
01:23:25,261 --> 01:23:27,867
- That's a hold, ref!
- Good no call, good no call.

1038
01:23:28,064 --> 01:23:29,941
Come on, ref! What do you need?

1039
01:23:30,133 --> 01:23:32,409
You're missing a good game!

1040
01:23:32,802 --> 01:23:34,281
Come on!

1041
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:37,246
Nice job, way to not get caught.
Way not to get caught.

1042
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,477
Hey, that's a hold. That's a hold, ref!

1043
01:23:39,675 --> 01:23:41,586
Quit your whining, 26.
You know whose field you're on!

1044
01:23:41,778 --> 01:23:43,280
Hey, hey, hey!

1045
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,860
You gotta make that call.

1046
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:48,390
Down 7-4 at half.

1047
01:23:48,584 --> 01:23:52,054
The Arrows are not going to get help from
anyone if they want back in this title game.

1048
01:23:52,255 --> 01:23:57,034
Joe Logan is going to have to impart
more than just strategy during halftime.

1049
01:23:59,061 --> 01:24:00,904
You know what you're gonna say?

1050
01:24:01,097 --> 01:24:02,906
Not really.

1051
01:24:04,867 --> 01:24:07,404
Okay, guys, great first half.

1052
01:24:07,603 --> 01:24:08,980
Yeah? Check the scoreboard.

1053
01:24:09,172 --> 01:24:11,345
- Tell that to the ref.
- Ref who?

1054
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:14,579
Hey, quiet. Hey, quiet!

1055
01:24:17,647 --> 01:24:20,321
Yeah, I hear you.

1056
01:24:20,516 --> 01:24:23,520
All right, yeah, they're bigger
than you, faster than you.

1057
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:27,428
And they have better facilities
and they have more championships.

1058
01:24:27,623 --> 01:24:30,001
And, yes, they have a better
coach than you.

1059
01:24:32,295 --> 01:24:37,335
But you know what?
None of that matters, okay?

1060
01:24:37,533 --> 01:24:42,505
This game is not about them,
this game is not about us.

1061
01:24:42,705 --> 01:24:45,117
And it's not about the scoreboard.

1062
01:24:47,443 --> 01:24:50,890
In the ancient game,
they didn't keep score.

1063
01:24:52,415 --> 01:24:56,557
They played to honor the Creator,
and so will we.

1064
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,258
We'll play to honor our ancestors
who were buried with their sticks.

1065
01:25:06,395 --> 01:25:10,571
We will play to honor our grandchildren
who will be given sticks when they're born.

1066
01:25:16,205 --> 01:25:19,550
This game has been in our blood
for a thousand years, gentlemen.

1067
01:25:20,443 --> 01:25:26,223
Today, win or lose,
we return lacrosse to our people.

1068
01:25:46,802 --> 01:25:48,008
Whoo! Whoo!

1069
01:25:54,577 --> 01:25:55,749
Let's go, boys!

1070
01:25:55,945 --> 01:25:59,916
Welcome back to The Bowl, where
the second half is about to get under way.

1071
01:26:00,116 --> 01:26:01,686
We got this, man.

1072
01:26:01,884 --> 01:26:03,488
Hey, no letups, we play four quarters.

1073
01:26:03,686 --> 01:26:05,529
Hey, no letups, no letups.

1074
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:15,439
Wait a minute, wait a minute, there's some
kind of a commotion at the end of the field.

1075
01:26:26,075 --> 01:26:32,287
It appears to be a large group of Native
Americans carrying some sort of tribal flags.

1076
01:27:04,747 --> 01:27:07,557
Despite the sudden invasion,
the Coventry supporters...

1077
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,889
...are making room
for these new lacrosse fans.

1078
01:27:14,857 --> 01:27:17,463
This place has gone totally Native!

1079
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:18,661
Whoo!

1080
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,946
Where'd they come from?

1081
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:38,522
Smoke signals.

1082
01:27:39,248 --> 01:27:41,751
All the Haudenosaunee Nations
in one spot.

1083
01:27:41,951 --> 01:27:44,522
I guess this is a home game now, huh?

1084
01:27:45,121 --> 01:27:46,691
Always was, son.

1085
01:27:49,759 --> 01:27:51,432
Go get them.

1086
01:27:53,963 --> 01:27:55,101
You ready to bleed again?

1087
01:27:55,297 --> 01:27:58,301
This is our game.
You just picked up the sticks we made.

1088
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:04,207
Yes, thattaboy, Jimmy!
Finally got one.

1089
01:28:04,407 --> 01:28:06,318
I'm open! Over here! Ball!

1090
01:28:06,509 --> 01:28:08,455
He's open! He's open!

1091
01:28:09,879 --> 01:28:10,880
Patience!

1092
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:15,187
Like predators, the Arrows are calmly
circling the Coventry goal.

1093
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:19,929
A pass too tall even for Maug.

1094
01:28:20,923 --> 01:28:22,869
Save it, Jimmy, save it!

1095
01:28:27,096 --> 01:28:29,201
Holy stick work!

1096
01:28:31,033 --> 01:28:33,707
- All right, we have numbers. Push it!
- Hustle, hustle, get there, Dawes.

1097
01:28:34,804 --> 01:28:36,806
We're a man down, we're a man down.

1098
01:28:38,107 --> 01:28:39,484
Yes!

1099
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:41,252
Yeah!

1100
01:28:42,611 --> 01:28:44,284
Yeah, get up, Twinkle Toes.

1101
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,221
Way not to give up on it, Jimmy!

1102
01:28:46,916 --> 01:28:48,293
Good hustle.

1103
01:28:53,456 --> 01:28:55,333
Look Sammy, look Sammy, look Sammy!

1104
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:02,431
Yeah.

1105
01:29:10,473 --> 01:29:12,282
Oh, my God, you gotta be kidding me!

1106
01:29:14,577 --> 01:29:16,215
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1107
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:30,668
Whatever the reason...

1108
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:32,305
Well, done, Silverfoot! Well done!

1109
01:29:32,495 --> 01:29:35,339
...the Arrows are playing with
a renewed sense of purpose.

1110
01:29:36,465 --> 01:29:38,877
Getting right back in the game.

1111
01:29:40,436 --> 01:29:44,316
They don't have Coventry's depth,
but they simply will not quit.

1112
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:48,853
Reed!

1113
01:29:52,815 --> 01:29:54,522
Chewy, that's it!

1114
01:30:09,832 --> 01:30:12,506
Are you kidding me?
Get on the bench. Get on the bench!

1115
01:30:12,701 --> 01:30:16,308
With their second-half surge,
the Arrows are right on Coventry's heels...

1116
01:30:16,505 --> 01:30:18,143
...but can they ever draw even?

1117
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:22,487
Now, Watson, now!

1118
01:30:24,613 --> 01:30:27,651
A rough, but perfectly legal hit.
- Yeah!

1119
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:30,353
And number 10 Grayhouse is out of the game.

1120
01:30:31,787 --> 01:30:34,563
Toby! You're in.

1121
01:30:34,757 --> 01:30:37,863
All right, they're gonna double-team Jimmy
and lay off you, all right? Be ready.

1122
01:30:38,861 --> 01:30:40,101
Oh, my God, Toby, Toby, Toby...

1123
01:30:40,729 --> 01:30:42,299
Captain.

1124
01:30:43,465 --> 01:30:44,705
Thank you.

1125
01:30:49,271 --> 01:30:52,980
Two-six, get him, Silverfoot! Pick him up.

1126
01:30:54,376 --> 01:30:56,515
Sticks up, off your hip!

1127
01:30:57,346 --> 01:30:59,053
Move! You gotta rotate!

1128
01:31:02,718 --> 01:31:05,824
Two-six, two-six!
Double, double, six, double!

1129
01:31:06,455 --> 01:31:08,128
Jimmy!
- Look Toby, look Toby!

1130
01:31:08,324 --> 01:31:10,326
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

1131
01:31:15,664 --> 01:31:16,836
Who's got him?

1132
01:31:21,437 --> 01:31:22,438
Yes!

1133
01:31:22,638 --> 01:31:26,450
Goal, point blank! Gifford with his first
of the season, first of his life.

1134
01:31:26,642 --> 01:31:28,644
Tie score late in the fourth.

1135
01:31:30,813 --> 01:31:32,724
Nice shot, Squirrel!

1136
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:41,427
Give me that scout report.
He's not even on here, who is that kid?

1137
01:31:41,624 --> 01:31:42,625
Yeah, Toby!

1138
01:31:42,825 --> 01:31:44,600
Watson, get your carcass over here
right now.

1139
01:31:44,793 --> 01:31:49,799
Joe Logan is coaching the game
of his life here, folks, and we're all tied up at 12.

1140
01:31:49,999 --> 01:31:51,205
Have you forgotten who we are?

1141
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,904
Because they could care less and they're
kicking your privileged tails all over the field.

1142
01:31:55,104 --> 01:31:57,311
Wake up and finish the job
or I'll find someone who will.

1143
01:31:57,506 --> 01:32:00,248
- On three, one two, three!
- Huh!

1144
01:32:02,311 --> 01:32:04,450
You've worked your whole life for this.
Now is the time!

1145
01:32:04,647 --> 01:32:07,287
You know who it's going to,
don't let 26 get the ball.

1146
01:32:15,224 --> 01:32:18,569
Brutal illegal hit by Dawes
and that's a call they can't miss.

1147
01:32:22,331 --> 01:32:26,473
He wasn't even in possession of the ball,
which makes it doubly egregious.

1148
01:32:26,669 --> 01:32:29,980
What did I do? I barely touched him.
I didn't do nothing.

1149
01:32:34,009 --> 01:32:36,182
The Arrows have been racked
by injuries today.

1150
01:32:36,378 --> 01:32:41,054
This is a fatal blow if Jimmy Silverfoot
is sidelined, leaving the team a man short.

1151
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:44,697
Take it easy. Take it easy, Jimmy. Medic.

1152
01:32:45,187 --> 01:32:46,495
Ah!

1153
01:32:48,557 --> 01:32:51,163
You got us this far,
we'll do the rest, all right?

1154
01:32:57,399 --> 01:32:58,673
I'm going in.

1155
01:32:58,867 --> 01:33:01,711
What? No, you only have one good leg.

1156
01:33:01,904 --> 01:33:04,714
Yeah, and no one else
has one good leg right now.

1157
01:33:08,844 --> 01:33:10,846
What are you doing with that cheap shot?

1158
01:33:11,046 --> 01:33:12,218
Deal with it and play the game.

1159
01:33:12,414 --> 01:33:15,395
- Now we're a man down.
- So are they. They're putting in a girl.

1160
01:33:15,584 --> 01:33:16,824
Turn around!

1161
01:33:23,859 --> 01:33:27,170
Twenty seconds left, all right?
Finish the possession, we take it in overtime...

1162
01:33:27,363 --> 01:33:30,139
-...and seal the deal, all right?
- Remember, you're just a decoy, okay?

1163
01:33:30,332 --> 01:33:31,367
Okay.

1164
01:33:31,567 --> 01:33:34,275
Not okay. I'm finishing this.

1165
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:36,973
Why, because you're better than me
with a broken arm?

1166
01:33:37,172 --> 01:33:39,243
It's just dislocated, I can still play.

1167
01:33:39,441 --> 01:33:42,354
Not with a sling you can't.
Look, Jimmy, you can't--

1168
01:33:42,544 --> 01:33:46,185
Her leg is my fault.
Last time I didn't go in, she got hurt.

1169
01:33:46,382 --> 01:33:48,453
I can't let that happen again.

1170
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:53,190
If one of those guys hits that ankle,
she'll never play again.

1171
01:33:54,123 --> 01:33:59,334
You got two years left, this is my last game.
Let me play, coach.

1172
01:34:02,698 --> 01:34:07,807
Ugh. Fine. But if you break your other arm,
I'm not helping you with your pajamas.

1173
01:34:08,003 --> 01:34:11,280
- I don't wear pajamas.
Ha-ha-ha.

1174
01:34:12,007 --> 01:34:17,150
Okay, guys, we're gonna run Z82.
Maug, move up to middie and set the pick.

1175
01:34:17,346 --> 01:34:19,383
Toby, top of the crease
and screen the goalie.

1176
01:34:19,581 --> 01:34:22,391
And Sammy, this is your shot, so hit it.

1177
01:34:22,584 --> 01:34:24,689
- I always do.
- Okay, sticks up, guys.

1178
01:34:24,887 --> 01:34:26,764
- Let's go, boys!
- Here we go!

1179
01:34:26,955 --> 01:34:30,232
- Crooked Arrows on three, one, two, three.
- Crooked Arrows! Whoo!

1180
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:34,632
Hey, hey, hey! Wait.
You're just a decoy, okay?

1181
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:36,400
Okay.

1182
01:34:36,598 --> 01:34:38,441
And here we go!

1183
01:34:38,634 --> 01:34:43,105
The Crooked Arrows have a man advantage
with gutsy Jimmy Silverfoot at middie.

1184
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:52,553
V-2-6, 2-6, left shoulder,
left shoulder 2-6.

1185
01:34:55,984 --> 01:34:57,554
Okay, okay, okay.

1186
01:35:14,703 --> 01:35:15,875
Now, Maug, now!

1187
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:21,152
- Here we go, here we go.
- Here we go, here we go.

1188
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:25,787
The Arrows work the ball around,
looking for an opening. Seconds ticking away.

1189
01:35:26,648 --> 01:35:28,787
Aah!
- Jimmy!

1190
01:35:30,152 --> 01:35:31,825
Ten seconds.

1191
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,899
Aah!
- Oh, my God.

1192
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:36,626
Watch Sam my! Watch Sam my!

1193
01:35:45,367 --> 01:35:47,540
And it's a loose ball!

1194
01:35:53,509 --> 01:35:54,510
Aah!

1195
01:35:56,245 --> 01:35:58,225
Shoot it!

1196
01:35:59,648 --> 01:36:01,594
Shot! Shot!

1197
01:36:03,685 --> 01:36:04,925
Aah!

1198
01:36:22,671 --> 01:36:27,711
Unbelievable!
SportsCenter, you've got your lead story!

1199
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:29,981
The Crooked Arrows are state champs!

1200
01:36:40,055 --> 01:36:43,036
All right, all right! Come on, get up! Get up.

1201
01:36:43,225 --> 01:36:45,671
Get off. Get off.

1202
01:36:46,595 --> 01:36:49,735
Coventry and Coach Emmitt
are taking the loss with great dignity.

1203
01:36:54,503 --> 01:36:55,948
Silverfoot, you all right?

1204
01:36:56,138 --> 01:36:57,742
Never been better.

1205
01:36:59,841 --> 01:37:01,445
Nice shot, ball hog.

1206
01:37:01,643 --> 01:37:03,645
What? Oh. Heh.

1207
01:37:04,613 --> 01:37:05,921
- Hey, decoy.
- Hey.

1208
01:37:09,318 --> 01:37:14,461
Hey, since I'm really hurt this time,
maybe I can get a kiss, coach.

1209
01:37:15,457 --> 01:37:16,868
Ah!

1210
01:37:19,227 --> 01:37:20,672
That's one good shot.

1211
01:37:23,065 --> 01:37:25,739
- Thanks, good game.
- Good luck next year.

1212
01:37:33,308 --> 01:37:34,719
Let's go, let's go!

1213
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:36,150
How about that?

1214
01:37:37,879 --> 01:37:40,723
I have come to learn the stubborn ways
of my children.

1215
01:37:40,916 --> 01:37:44,728
You, your time is coming.

1216
01:37:46,888 --> 01:37:52,998
And you have found your spirit,
Abooksigun.

1217
01:37:55,497 --> 01:37:56,976
It was you.

1218
01:38:00,802 --> 01:38:02,110
Yo, Coach Joe!

1219
01:38:02,971 --> 01:38:04,644
Here. You earned this.

1220
01:38:23,825 --> 01:38:27,136
- Hey.
- Hey. So...

1221
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,440
Is that a yes?

1222
01:38:36,638 --> 01:38:37,639
Come on.

1223
01:39:03,532 --> 01:39:09,107
When the first game between
the animals ended, the Creator was pleased.

1224
01:39:10,072 --> 01:39:14,043
And he gave the Medicine Game
to the people of the Haudenosaunee.

1225
01:39:15,077 --> 01:39:20,925
That we may all come together
as one and heal each other.

1226
01:39:53,115 --> 01:39:56,619
Yeah, yeah
Check the highlight tape

1227
01:39:56,818 --> 01:39:59,992
Put your beats with lyrics till I actuate
Grinding past the physical limits

1228
01:40:00,188 --> 01:40:03,067
Of which I violate
My mental place is in the Garden State

1229
01:40:03,258 --> 01:40:06,296
Spilling my body weight
Then hydrate until my pupils dilate

1230
01:40:06,495 --> 01:40:08,771
I make you go for broke
Pulling out the only fund

1231
01:40:08,964 --> 01:40:11,069
I don't blow my nose
Cleaner than a smoking gun

1232
01:40:11,266 --> 01:40:13,837
My friends dope a ton
Stay above the choking lung

1233
01:40:14,035 --> 01:40:16,447
Pushing up, hands stringing sticks
With a broken thumb

1234
01:40:16,638 --> 01:40:18,845
I keep it casual
Always check the manual

1235
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:21,543
Always improvise
Already memorized the manual

1236
01:40:21,743 --> 01:40:23,654
My gains are gradual
But always moving up

1237
01:40:23,845 --> 01:40:26,758
Trading stocks with fake money
Learning how to chase the fast buck

1238
01:40:26,948 --> 01:40:29,155
I'm a fast buck
You better match up

1239
01:40:29,351 --> 01:40:32,025
Swim move, then I'm burning by you
Like a fat Dutch

1240
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:36,669
Paint the corners when I shoot with braces flow
Whipping my stick they said it was miracle

1241
01:40:36,858 --> 01:40:39,270
I'm getting goosebumps
On me when I'm lyrical

1242
01:40:39,461 --> 01:40:41,839
Killing beats one at a time
Like they were cereal

1243
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:44,533
I've moved around a lot
Lived on many different blocks

1244
01:40:44,733 --> 01:40:47,270
From partners of the street
To waking up to smoking shots

1245
01:40:47,469 --> 01:40:49,346
Well, I'm gonna stop it now
Check the flow

1246
01:40:49,538 --> 01:40:52,314
I'm Coventry
Rapping with a couple Crooked Arrows

1247
01:41:03,919 --> 01:41:05,193
Let's wrap.

1248
01:41:25,073 --> 01:41:29,783
I've got to remember

1249
01:41:30,345 --> 01:41:34,452
That all I need is right inside of me

1250
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:40,565
I look at this world around me

1251
01:41:40,822 --> 01:41:45,328
The tallest tree was once just a seed

1252
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:51,306
Over and over, what I find
Is when I see it in my mind

1253
01:41:51,499 --> 01:41:56,380
It's only just a matter of time

1254
01:41:56,571 --> 01:42:01,680
Keep your eyes on winning

1255
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:07,182
'Cause if you try you'll never really lose

1256
01:42:07,382 --> 01:42:09,259
I'm John Desko and I'm a Crooked Arrow.

1257
01:42:09,451 --> 01:42:11,158
I'm Brody Merrill and I'm a Crooked Arrow.

1258
01:42:11,353 --> 01:42:13,060
I'm Gary Gait and I'm a Crooked Arrow.

1259
01:42:13,255 --> 01:42:14,859
I'm Lars Tiffany and I'm a Crooked Arrow.

1260
01:42:15,056 --> 01:42:16,501
- I'm a Crooked Arrow.
- I'm a Crooked Arrow.

1261
01:42:16,691 --> 01:42:18,432
- I'm a Crooked Arrow.
- I'm a Crooked Arrow.

1262
01:42:18,627 --> 01:42:21,335
Dream big

1263
01:42:23,164 --> 01:42:26,509
Dream big

1264
01:42:26,701 --> 01:42:28,681
Yeah

1265
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:31,009
Each day

1266
01:42:31,206 --> 01:42:33,652
That you wake up

1267
01:42:33,842 --> 01:42:38,621
Is a chance for you to start
Something new

1268
01:42:39,514 --> 01:42:44,554
It's there for the taking

1269
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:49,130
But that first step is always up to you

1270
01:42:49,324 --> 01:42:52,100
Over and over, what I find

1271
01:42:52,294 --> 01:42:55,537
Is when I see it in my mind

1272
01:42:55,730 --> 01:43:00,201
It's only just a matter of time

1273
01:43:00,402 --> 01:43:05,909
Keep your eyes on winning

1274
01:43:06,107 --> 01:43:10,852
'Cause if you try you'll never really lose

1275
01:43:11,046 --> 01:43:16,359
Yeah, this life's for living

1276
01:43:16,551 --> 01:43:21,193
There's no limit to the things that we can do

1277
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:27,169
Keep your eyes on winning

1278
01:43:27,395 --> 01:43:32,174
'Cause if you try you'll never really lose

1279
01:43:32,367 --> 01:43:37,612
Yeah, this life's for living

1280
01:43:37,806 --> 01:43:42,721
There's no limit to the things that we can do

1281
01:43:42,911 --> 01:43:51,626
Dream big

1282
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:53,697
Yeah

1283
01:43:53,888 --> 01:43:56,232
Dream big

1284
01:43:56,424 --> 01:43:58,904
Dream big

1285
01:43:59,094 --> 01:44:05,067
Dream big

1286
01:44:05,266 --> 01:44:06,768
O

1287
01:44:06,968 --> 01:44:12,543
Keep your eyes on winning

1288
01:44:12,741 --> 01:44:17,417
'Cause if you try you'll never really lose

1289
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:22,994
Yeah, this life's for living

1290
01:44:23,184 --> 01:44:28,156
There's no limit to the things that we can do

1291
01:44:28,356 --> 01:44:30,927
Dream big

1292
01:44:31,126 --> 01:44:33,629
Dream big

1293
01:44:33,828 --> 01:44:38,902
Dream big

1294
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:44,311
Yeah, this life's for living

1295
01:44:44,506 --> 01:44:49,285
There's no limit to the things that we can do

1296
01:44:55,683 --> 01:45:00,291
It's only just a matter of time
