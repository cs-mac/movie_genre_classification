1
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,540


2
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,702
1,500.

3
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,011
Last week, it was 1,600.

4
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,443
I'm getting slower.

5
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,980
I'm not getting any younger.

6
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,032
I must put some sausages in the stew.

7
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,366
Father is sick of your salads.

8
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,865
No wonder he keeps grousing!

9
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:37,304
If you knew how much poison
there is in meat and sausages!

10
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:39,375
Nothing but chemicals!

11
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:41,912
I know what proper nutrition is.

12
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:47,550
Dad likes his meat, Helene,
and he works for what he likes.

13
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,991
People just don't know
what's good for them.

14
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,123
But go ahead.
It's yourselves you're harming.

15
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:57,821
One man's meat is another man's poison.

16
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:00,662
Dad wants what he's always been used to.

17
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:02,698
You can't change him.

18
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,396
And why should you?

19
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:05,960
He's healthy.

20
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,969
You won't make a vegetarian out of Dad.

21
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,439
I don't want to, Mom.

22
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,179
But people should know what
they're eating.

23
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:18,880
Ernst can tell you all about
the chemicals in sausages nowadays.

24
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,382
Nothing but chemicals and preservatives!

25
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:24,917
Yes, yes.

26
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:31,319
Franz was telling me about Finland.

27
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:34,431
It rains all the time, he said...

28
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,559
and it's as cold as ice...

29
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,228
especially now in spring.

30
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:43,142
But we've booked, Ernst!

31
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:47,272
Besides, heat's no good in my condition.
I need a mild climate.

32
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,179
And anyway, better cold than hot.

33
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:53,516
Anyway, it's quiet there
and that's the main thing.

34
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:58,016
The whole year, I stand in the cold-store
and I have to spend...

35
00:03:58,088 --> 00:04:00,992
my vacation at the North Pole! It's stupid!

36
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,895
You must think of our child, Ernst.

37
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,227
I know why we're going to Finland.

38
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:10,201
If you don't think,
I have to think for two.

39
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:26,216
Do you think your Ernst would be
so strong if he didn't eat meat...

40
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,111
just your salads?

41
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,382
Don't worry, Mom. I'll be OK.

42
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,219
I just meant, because of the climate...

43
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,830
How often have I told you
you should retrain for another job?

44
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:41,492
Then you wouldn't have to stand
in that cold-store. It's unhealthy, anyway.

45
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:44,127
Ernst always wanted to be a butcher.

46
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:51,638
You have to be able to change your life.
Everyone knows that.

47
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:54,907
<i>We are interrupting our program
for a special news flash.</i>

48
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,648
<i>At a chemical plant near Frankfurt...</i>

49
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:01,777
<i>a mentally deranged worker...</i>

50
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,454
<i>beat his personnel manager to death...</i>

51
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,585
<i>and then committed suicide
on a machine in the production hall.</i>

52
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,794
<i>The cause of this terrible tragedy
is still unclear.</i>

53
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:16,624
<i>The police are continuing
their investigations.</i>

54
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:19,630
<i>And now, we return to our music program.</i>

55
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:22,036
The things that happen nowadays!

56
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,101
What's keeping Dad?

57
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:25,864
It's past 6:00.

58
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,377
He'll come. He always has.

59
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,043
"At a chemical plant," they said.

60
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:37,282
Is a tire factory a chemical plant?

61
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:41,520
Sure it's a chemical plant.
Everything's chemicals nowadays.

62
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:45,120
Where do you think all the dirt
and pollution come from?

63
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:14,817
That'll be Dad.
He must have forgotten his keys.

64
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,969
I don't have much time.

65
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,505
There's something I have to tell you,
Emma.

66
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:35,008
Something terrible has happened.

67
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,438
To Hermann?

68
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:38,513
Yes, he's...

69
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,615
He killed himself. At the plant.

70
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,882
He's dead?

71
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,785
Yes, but...

72
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:49,788
there's worse to come.

73
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,348
Before that...

74
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:55,162
Before that, he killed someone.
Beat him to death.

75
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,426
The boss's son, Dr. Berthold.

76
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,600
At the chemical plant.

77
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:05,997
Hermann must have heard something
about mass layoffs...

78
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,743
and he just blew a fuse.

79
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,825
Telephone for you, dear.
I think it's your mother.

80
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:35,170
I told her not to phone
during working hours.

81
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,733
Hennecke hates it.

82
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,907
She said it's important, dear.
She's all worked up.

83
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,511
OK, I'll go.

84
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:58,589
Hello, Mom!

85
00:07:58,657 --> 00:07:59,886
Corinna?

86
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:02,990
Sorry to phone you, but-

87
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:05,294
Mother, you know that...

88
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:07,228
Yes, but listen...

89
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,191
it's about Dad.

90
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:12,973
- You must come right away.
- What's happened?

91
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:14,667
Corinna!

92
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:16,540
Dad's dead.

93
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,071
He killed himself.

94
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:22,274
And there's something else.

95
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,045
Oh, Mother, don't cry!

96
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:29,946
You mustn't cry.

97
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,080
Just a moment.

98
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,423
Something's happened to my father.

99
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:40,124
Mom, take care of yourself!

100
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:42,226
Don't get upset!

101
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,566
I'll come as soon as I can.

102
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:47,203
My Hermann.

103
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:49,037
I couldn't even see him.

104
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:51,544
And you know what they're saying?

105
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:53,742
That he's a murderer.

106
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:56,212
A murderer, Corinna!

107
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:06,448
Mom, I'll come.

108
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:08,890
I'll come right away.

109
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,174
I have to talk to you. Give me a drink!

110
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,371
You leave us in the lurch...

111
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:30,580
and I'm fool enough to reward you for it.

112
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:33,179
Well...

113
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:35,484
what's up?

114
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:39,723
It was my mother.

115
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,124
Dad's dead. He's killed himself.

116
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:45,829
And there was something else, too.

117
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:47,525
I don't remember.

118
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,528
But I have to go.

119
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:55,370
My sweetheart's getting sentimental
in her old age.

120
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:59,876
Have another whiskey
and forget the whole thing.

121
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:02,804
Who has a family nowadays?

122
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,672
Who, I ask you?

123
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:07,043
And at your age!

124
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,477
You're as free as a bird.

125
00:10:11,454 --> 00:10:14,290
Have another drink
before your next number.

126
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,494
Then we'll go home and fuck like rabbits...

127
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:21,230
and tomorrow,
everything will be forgotten.

128
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,931
You're crazy, Gustav.

129
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,364
I couldn't sing a note now.

130
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:29,835
After all, it's art I'm creating.

131
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,204
Oh, yes...

132
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:33,335
art!

133
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:35,812
Art and life.

134
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:40,883
And fresh rolls in the morning,
and whiskey in the evening.

135
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:44,987
Drink your milk and forget the bogeyman.

136
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,084
I can't.

137
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:49,921
I've always kept in contact
with my mother.

138
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:52,428
She stood by me as best she could.

139
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:56,056
I can't let her down now.

140
00:10:58,134 --> 00:11:00,604
You're too soft for this business.

141
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,861
Just too soft.

142
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:04,870
Yes, I suppose I am.

143
00:11:06,508 --> 00:11:08,809
I'll get changed and clear out.

144
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:13,782
"... and cleft the bond of love in twain...

145
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,816
"with one stroke of the whip."

146
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,545
Who's that by?

147
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,283
By me.

148
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,454
The poetry of business life.

149
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,597
Ciao, Gustav!

150
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,629
Beat it!

151
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:38,841
How could it have happened?

152
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:42,078
- My God, I have no idea.
- When did you hear about it?

153
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,113
Turn your head this way!

154
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,879
Please don't!

155
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:51,416
That's no way to photograph a lady.
Can't you see the state I'm in?

156
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:54,717
Have some understanding!

157
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:57,693
What impression did your father
make lately?

158
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,928
I don't know.

159
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,629
The same as always. Perfectly normal.

160
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:05,190
Did he make any remarks to you?

161
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:06,832
Remarks?

162
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:09,133
We didn't talk much.

163
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:13,408
I don't want to be recognized
in the photos.

164
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:17,346
You're damaging my career.
What if my colleagues recognize me?

165
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:20,178
Did your father-in-law
suffer from depression?

166
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:22,377
No. He never talked about himself.

167
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:25,580
- What was your relationship like?
- I don't know.

168
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:28,350
We just talked about everyday things.

169
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,087
- Did your father complain about his work?
- Dad?

170
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,319
He never complained.

171
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:38,060
He'd been doing this job for over 20 years.

172
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,931
Sometimes he looked tired.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,436
But all he said was...

174
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:45,170
"I'm not the youngest anymore."

175
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:48,137
Weren't there ever family quarrels?

176
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,806
I mean,
living on top of each other like this.

177
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,643
That's only natural.

178
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:56,108
It happens in all families.

179
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:58,653
But never for long, and never seriously.

180
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:00,814
Did he often pick quarrels?

181
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,083
Dad never picked a quarrel.

182
00:13:03,223 --> 00:13:06,662
He avoided conflict where he could.
He was the quiet sort.

183
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,753
What about your childhood?

184
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:11,196
Did he never beat you?

185
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:13,593
Sure...

186
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,904
I got my share of whacks.
You know how it is.

187
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,373
Did he ever give you a real beating?

188
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:22,340
Maybe.

189
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:25,674
- Yes, probably.
- What made him do that?

190
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,412
I haven't the faintest idea.

191
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:31,419
Any idea how this thing
could have happened?

192
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:32,742
No.

193
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,648
I wasn't there.

194
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,190
I can only think he went crazy.

195
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:42,995
Simply crazy.

196
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,332
Things like that happen.

197
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,649
Excuse me, Mrs. Küsters.

198
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,312
I don't want to bother you.

199
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,482
I can imagine how you feel.

200
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:16,361
But maybe you could answer
a few questions.

201
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:24,101
I don't want to distress you,
but it's my job to report on this case.

202
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,498
You knew your husband best.

203
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:30,837
You're the one who's
most likely to know the truth.

204
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,847
And that's all I'm interested in. The truth.

205
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:39,411
Yes, I understand.

206
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:44,148
You have to write about it.

207
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:46,989
But today?

208
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:50,724
What can I possibly say today?

209
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,094
My head's all empty.

210
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:56,258
It's all empty.

211
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:01,030
It's not always easy for us either.

212
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:02,501
But...

213
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,846
if it isn't possible today,
maybe I could come some other time?

214
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,880
Say, tomorrow?

215
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:11,709
At 10:00?

216
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:15,377
It's your job, I suppose.

217
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:18,187
All right, then, come.

218
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:19,584
Thanks.

219
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:22,152
See you tomorrow.

220
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:37,272
Chin up, Mrs. Küsters!

221
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,771
Chin up!

222
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:19,583
It's strange.

223
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:22,946
People live side by side for years...

224
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,114
and hardly know each other.

225
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,957
And you know what will come of it?

226
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:31,826
What our dear colleagues will make of it?

227
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:34,521
One trumped-up story after another.

228
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:38,698
I can see it now.
"Was the factory killer insane?"

229
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:42,772
"The man who beat his son,
beat his boss to death!"

230
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,243
- That's how they'll present it.
- Of course they will.

231
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,840
There's a grain of truth in it, after all.
That can't be denied.

232
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:54,477
If they make a sensation out of it
that's their business.

233
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:57,953
I'll tackle it quite differently.
I'll stick to the truth.

234
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,287
I want to find the true cause.

235
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,259
If only I knew how to get through
to the old woman!

236
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:08,326
How it affects her.

237
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,862
Will it change her awareness?

238
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:17,435
That's what I'd like to know.

239
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,677
Karl?

240
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,890
Isn't the method exactly the same?

241
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,788
The method may be the same, Marianne.

242
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:41,423
It's the results that count.

243
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:50,201
Okay, Mrs. Küsters!

244
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,965
A bit closer to the stove!

245
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,402
And now, stir!

246
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,507
Yes. That's good.

247
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,748
Was your husband satisfied
with your cooking?

248
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,290
Or did he sometimes complain?

249
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:09,992
Hermann was a quiet man.

250
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:11,956
He never complained.

251
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:14,859
If he didn't like something, he said so.

252
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:17,692
You knew where you were. He was fair.

253
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,027
He was always fair.

254
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:22,169
That was fine.

255
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,673
Now let's take one of you working.

256
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,300
Would you sit down there?

257
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,615
Go on talking, Mrs. Küsters. I'm listening.

258
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:39,216
I suppose your husband liked a drink
now and then?

259
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,813
Of course. Every man does.

260
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,792
With the other workers.

261
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,860
Sure, he liked a drink.

262
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:50,666
And when he came home drunk?
What happened then?

263
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,363
He was never drunk,
not so as he couldn't stand upright.

264
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,231
He never drank much.

265
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,208
He would go straight to bed
and fall asleep.

266
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,544
And were there ever any quarrels?

267
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,006
Quarrels?

268
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,413
I used to laugh
when he couldn't walk straight...

269
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,714
and I'd say, "You old boozer!"

270
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,886
Then he'd say, "Leave me alone...

271
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,390
"I feel awful. I'm going to bed."

272
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,115
And he was off.

273
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,332
And now, one of you making the bed.

274
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,260
If you think so.

275
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,913
No. Don't hold the blanket so high!
It's covering your face.

276
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,472
How was your husband with the kids?

277
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,216
That's so long ago.

278
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,416
Thirty years or more.
But one thing I do know.

279
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,655
He was far too good.
They could get away with anything.

280
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,263
Sure, he hit the roof sometimes.

281
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,699
But he was younger then.

282
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,932
He'd smack them or give them a beating.

283
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,211
To tell you the truth,
I got one or two myself...

284
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,907
when I upset him.

285
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,639
But later he calmed down.

286
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,016
He became very quiet.

287
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:26,450
So, that about wraps it up.

288
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,122
Just a shot in the sitting room.

289
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,038
Maybe one of you holding a picture
of your husband? A recent one.

290
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,970
I'm sure you have one.

291
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,108
This is the last picture of him.

292
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:53,017
Taken three weeks ago at the zoo.

293
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:56,049
On Sundays, we often went to the zoo...

294
00:20:57,755 --> 00:20:59,087
on Sunday.

295
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:04,925
If you'd just turn towards me.

296
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,489
Yes.

297
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:11,169
And the photo this way.

298
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:14,233
Yes, that's good.

299
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,041
Tell me,
your husband wasn't so young anymore.

300
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:24,780
The work must have been
pretty hard for him.

301
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:26,613
Did he never complain?

302
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:29,211
Was he dissatisfied with his bosses?

303
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:34,751
My husband never complained.

304
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:41,498
Maybe he'd say, "It was tough today."

305
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:43,661
But that was all.

306
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:46,698
He accepted his superiors.

307
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:49,632
I didn't ask often, either.

308
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:52,877
We just lived our lives, day in, day out...

309
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:55,877
without asking each other much.

310
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:59,710
Maybe I should have asked him more.

311
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:02,153
Perhaps he had troubles.

312
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:04,646
He just bottled it all up.

313
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:08,389
He was such a kind-hearted man.

314
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:13,693
He didn't do it for himself.
He did it for the others...

315
00:22:13,763 --> 00:22:15,995
who were in the same situation.

316
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:17,500
For those...

317
00:22:17,968 --> 00:22:20,438
who would have been laid off, too.

318
00:22:20,502 --> 00:22:22,802
He was too good for this world.

319
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:25,509
That's what Max said, his foreman.

320
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:28,068
I have an idea.

321
00:22:28,444 --> 00:22:31,746
We'll show them! A shot of you
at the factory gate. What do you say?

322
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:34,251
At the factory gate? I don't know.

323
00:22:36,385 --> 00:22:39,221
- Mrs. Küsters? A telegram for you.
- Thanks.

324
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,089
A telegram from my daughter.

325
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,598
She's arriving at the airport at 12:00.
I have to pick her up.

326
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,602
You have a daughter? I didn't know that!

327
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:55,264
She doesn't work here. She's away a lot.

328
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:57,535
Corinna's a singer, you know.

329
00:22:57,673 --> 00:22:59,870
A singer? That's interesting!

330
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:03,542
I'll take you to the airport.

331
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:06,248
At 12:00, you said? I can manage that.

332
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:08,843
Well, thanks. I'll just get ready.

333
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,503
Mom!

334
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,762
My name's Niemeyer. I'm a reporter.

335
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:02,269
Corinna Coren.

336
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:04,533
Can I drive you back to town?

337
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:17,578
I'm reporting on your father's case.

338
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:20,414
Did his death come as a great shock
to you?

339
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:23,220
Yes. It took me completely by surprise.

340
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:25,991
I'm on tour right now, you know.

341
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:29,025
Yes. It's terrible.

342
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:35,666
We reporters are said to be
a hard-boiled bunch...

343
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:37,899
but it's not true.

344
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:42,644
These things really touch us to the quick.

345
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,111
There were so many people
in the apartment.

346
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:47,706
The papers are probably full of it.

347
00:24:48,482 --> 00:24:51,248
It's a good thing I haven't read them yet.

348
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:54,621
They're bound to say
nasty things about your father.

349
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:57,150
And he was such a good man.

350
00:24:57,691 --> 00:24:59,592
Say he was a good man!

351
00:24:59,693 --> 00:25:01,822
Yes, Mom, he was a good man.

352
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:16,043
I'll do my utmost
to report as objectively as possible.

353
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:20,240
I promise you...

354
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,743
I'll do all I can.

355
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:27,520
That's good. Thanks.

356
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:31,855
I told you what my husband
was really like.

357
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:37,855
Yes.

358
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,691
May I invite you to lunch?

359
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:42,998
You must be hungry.

360
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:46,269
Yes, I am.

361
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:48,832
Pretty hungry.

362
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,542
It'll be easier to talk, too.

363
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:59,346
And there's a lot
I'd like to find out from you.

364
00:26:04,756 --> 00:26:08,526
You can find out everything,
everything you want to know.

365
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,667
Thanks a lot.

366
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:18,798
But I have so much to do.

367
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:20,902
Later, Mother, later.

368
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:47,696
What I'm most interested in,
Miss Coren, is your childhood.

369
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,461
My childhood?

370
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:57,006
I never had a proper childhood.

371
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,643
We were very badly off.

372
00:27:00,345 --> 00:27:02,542
We had nothing in those days.

373
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,584
But, dear, we always looked after you.

374
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,844
Yes, Mom, sure.

375
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:12,414
But compared to nowadays!

376
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:15,023
How could you have afforded it?

377
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,620
You...

378
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:20,426
left home at an early age?

379
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,368
What do you call early?

380
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:27,904
After high school. I wanted to study.

381
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:31,969
And your father wasn't supportive?

382
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:38,042
He couldn't see why a girl should study.

383
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:42,853
Ernst wasn't interested, and that left me.

384
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:47,550
But he never put obstacles
in your way, Corinna.

385
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:50,452
You were free to do what you wanted.

386
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:54,094
Dad didn't like students, Mother.
You know that as well as I do.

387
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:56,498
You never really studied anyway.

388
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,694
Yes. Things turned out differently.

389
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:02,232
I became a singer.

390
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,606
So your mother told me.

391
00:28:06,475 --> 00:28:08,445
How did that come about?

392
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:12,348
It was fate.

393
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:13,915
I just sing.

394
00:28:15,051 --> 00:28:17,352
And I write my own lyrics, too.

395
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:22,919
Really?

396
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:24,985
Yes.

397
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,030
- Excuse me a moment.
- Certainly.

398
00:28:42,912 --> 00:28:46,510
Don't be offended by her.
She's always been a bit strange.

399
00:28:46,581 --> 00:28:48,779
Not at all. I'm not offended.

400
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:50,644
On the contrary!

401
00:28:56,292 --> 00:29:00,426
I'd like to speak to the editor
working on the factory murder case.

402
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:02,124
I'm the daughter.

403
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,468
My name's Coren.

404
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:14,442
Corinna Coren, that's my stage name.

405
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,680
My real name is Küsters.

406
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,343
Yes, I'm a singer.

407
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:25,010
I'm sure you've heard of my record.

408
00:29:25,687 --> 00:29:27,315
It was a big hit:

409
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:30,119
"Men? Who Cares About Them?"

410
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,424
Yes, of course
I'm willing to talk to you. With pleasure.

411
00:29:36,264 --> 00:29:38,496
I thought you'd be interested.

412
00:29:41,502 --> 00:29:42,766
Any time.

413
00:30:03,857 --> 00:30:06,954
- How about this evening at 8:00?
- If you like.

414
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:08,690
Yes, I would like.

415
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:13,494
- Where's my mother?
- She went to wash her hands.

416
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:16,605
Miss. The check, please!

417
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:20,007
We can't cancel the vacation, Mom.

418
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,178
There's money tied up in it.
We saved up the whole year.

419
00:30:23,243 --> 00:30:26,409
You can't go away now,
after what happened to Dad!

420
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,850
You can't just go off!
He's not even been buried yet!

421
00:30:31,952 --> 00:30:34,013
You can't just run away...

422
00:30:35,189 --> 00:30:36,715
and leave me...

423
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:38,256
all alone.

424
00:30:42,162 --> 00:30:44,428
I'm carrying a new life inside me.

425
00:30:44,497 --> 00:30:46,467
I have to think of that.

426
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:49,464
And staying here won't bring Dad back.

427
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:53,099
I daren't risk a miscarriage,
the doctor said.

428
00:30:53,573 --> 00:30:55,941
It's all too much for me anyway.

429
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,008
- Don't you understand?
- Yes, I understand you.

430
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,075
But, Ernst, you can't leave your mother
alone with all this.

431
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:06,183
We have to think of the baby, Mom.

432
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:08,017
You must understand.

433
00:31:08,387 --> 00:31:10,880
Have you lost all sense of decency?

434
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:38,110
Mom...

435
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:39,675
we'll be back.

436
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:44,320
There's no alternative.
Helene's nerves are worn to a frazzle.

437
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:47,127
It's all right, my boy.

438
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,153
I'll be okay.

439
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:53,025
Go and help Helene pack.

440
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,096
Please!

441
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:05,272
- What's up here?
- Mom's sore because we're leaving.

442
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:08,783
- No one can understand that.
- It's easy for you to talk.

443
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:12,286
You don't care about us.
You come only on special occasions.

444
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:14,983
I was earning money.

445
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:17,647
I was singing.

446
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:20,720
Singing? You call that singing?

447
00:32:21,326 --> 00:32:23,957
- I earn my money, too.
- Shut up, damn it!

448
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,363
It's true! All this commotion here!

449
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,059
My life's ruined.

450
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:31,367
My picture's in all the papers!
But you don't care!

451
00:32:32,837 --> 00:32:34,169
About what?

452
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,573
About this business with Father.

453
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,941
I don't care? Why am I here, then?

454
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,535
God only knows.

455
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:44,650
I wonder what goes on
in that brain of yours.

456
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:47,948
Look who's talking!

457
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:54,485
How did it actually happen,
this business with Dad?

458
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:55,787
No idea!

459
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:00,027
Max Lüders said there was talk of layoffs
and so on.

460
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:03,465
And that Dad wanted to inquire.

461
00:33:03,534 --> 00:33:05,504
That's all anyone knows.

462
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,340
It probably led to an argument,
and then it happened.

463
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:11,002
Strange.

464
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:13,641
Dad was such a quiet type.

465
00:33:14,377 --> 00:33:16,244
Oh, that'll be for me.

466
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,839
Bye!

467
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,786
Helene!

468
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,349
Yes?

469
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:33,857
Maybe we should stay.
Because of Mom and so on.

470
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:36,830
No, Ernst, we're going.

471
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,336
Or I'll go alone. But then...

472
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,902
I just meant, because of Mother.

473
00:33:42,973 --> 00:33:45,273
She's not the youngest anymore.

474
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:50,745
Whose side are you on?

475
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:52,673
Mine or theirs?

476
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:55,212
Make up your mind!

477
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:09,532
O Lord, who in Thy mercy
forgiveth all sinners...

478
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:12,061
forgive Thy servant Hermann.

479
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:14,867
Deliver him from the sufferings
of purgatory.

480
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:19,309
Lead him, like all Thy children,
to the light of salvation...

481
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:22,141
forever and ever. Amen.

482
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:56,890
Miss Coren, what are your plans
for the future?

483
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,091
I have no firm plans.

484
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:01,394
Will you continue to sing?

485
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:02,731
Of course.

486
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:05,102
I'm at the start of my career.

487
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:07,699
I see no reason to break it off.

488
00:37:07,774 --> 00:37:11,076
Will your father's actions
help or hinder your career?

489
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:13,376
I'd prefer not to answer that.

490
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:17,679
But this business has made
you known to a wider audience.

491
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:20,711
I will pursue my career as an artist.

492
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:22,847
Will you be performing here in Frankfurt?

493
00:37:22,922 --> 00:37:26,486
I've had various offers,
which I'm looking into.

494
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:29,862
I may well perform here.

495
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:51,480
Hello, Mrs. Küsters!

496
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,021
Your daughter has left already.

497
00:37:56,088 --> 00:37:59,653
Can we help you in any way?
Can we take you back to town?

498
00:38:01,226 --> 00:38:03,663
Why don't you come
and have coffee with us?

499
00:38:03,729 --> 00:38:06,667
You could probably use it.
It'll do you good.

500
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:08,098
Come along!

501
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:37,593
I hope...

502
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:40,897
you've found some peace of mind.

503
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:46,705
It was really a bit much for you.

504
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:50,970
All that agitation and so on.

505
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:57,942
It has been awful these past few days.

506
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:01,317
For years, nothing happens...

507
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:03,552
and then, overnight...

508
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:07,118
everything comes crashing down on you.

509
00:39:07,457 --> 00:39:09,518
Yes, my dear Mrs. Küsters...

510
00:39:09,593 --> 00:39:12,121
it can't be easy for you, but...

511
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:15,196
How should I put it?

512
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:17,930
There's a lesson in it for all of us to learn.

513
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:20,905
Lesson? What is there
left for you to learn?

514
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:24,704
You know everything, have everything...

515
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:29,177
Having something doesn't mean
you know everything.

516
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:31,709
We know so little.

517
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:34,613
And what we have...

518
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:37,016
Marianne inherited.

519
00:39:37,454 --> 00:39:38,820
The house and...

520
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:40,220
Oh, I see.

521
00:39:42,092 --> 00:39:45,121
What we can learn from this affair...

522
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:49,195
is that it's not so simple...

523
00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:52,302
the business with your husband...

524
00:39:52,702 --> 00:39:56,368
and his being "out of his mind,"
as they say in the papers.

525
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,533
That's not the real reason.

526
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:01,774
One must look for other explanations.

527
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:06,345
What your husband did is, in a sense...

528
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:10,343
revolutionary.

529
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:13,479
Revolutionary?

530
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:14,783
No...

531
00:40:15,058 --> 00:40:16,617
not my Hermann.

532
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,087
He was always a quiet man.

533
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:23,893
There was never any of that.

534
00:40:25,168 --> 00:40:26,500
Of course.

535
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,663
I said "in a sense."

536
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:36,606
One must realize that murder
doesn't solve any problems.

537
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:40,949
Your husband tried to solve his problem...

538
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:44,720
but by the wrong means.

539
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:47,047
He could have done it better...

540
00:40:47,122 --> 00:40:50,151
by seeking a solution on another plane.

541
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:53,356
But...

542
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,354
his problem...

543
00:40:56,131 --> 00:40:58,363
is the problem of all workers.

544
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:04,637
Only when they are strong
and united can changes occur...

545
00:41:06,374 --> 00:41:09,471
that will be of benefit
to the whole of society.

546
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,675
An isolated deed...

547
00:41:13,548 --> 00:41:16,179
especially a killing, doesn't help.

548
00:41:17,086 --> 00:41:19,318
The working classes must unite...

549
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:22,655
and use the best means available...

550
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:24,523
to achieve socialism.

551
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:28,291
Hermann never said he was oppressed...

552
00:41:28,563 --> 00:41:30,031
or exploited.

553
00:41:30,598 --> 00:41:33,764
He always said
that's the way it is in the world.

554
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:36,431
There have to be masters...

555
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:38,162
and servants.

556
00:41:38,606 --> 00:41:42,808
Yes, because he wasn't aware that
these conditions can be changed...

557
00:41:43,745 --> 00:41:46,683
if everyone joins forces
and fights together.

558
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:50,882
Then he'd have known there don't
have to be servants and masters...

559
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:55,216
but that we must seek
to give everyone an equal share...

560
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,224
of what we all produce together.

561
00:42:00,794 --> 00:42:02,161
You see...

562
00:42:03,197 --> 00:42:05,190
throughout the country...

563
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:08,136
in all the factories...

564
00:42:08,668 --> 00:42:12,665
there are people working,
making things that are sold for money.

565
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:15,101
But who pockets the money?

566
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:19,972
The workers are fobbed off
with a tiny share of the profits.

567
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:24,279
The lion's share goes
to the business owners...

568
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:26,749
to the capitalists.

569
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,485
And that is unjust.

570
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:31,922
It has to be changed.

571
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:34,421
Surely you agree?

572
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:37,154
But not everyone can have the same.

573
00:42:38,364 --> 00:42:41,336
The people at the top
have more responsibility.

574
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,233
That's where you're wrong.

575
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,803
You see...

576
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:48,570
when there's a crisis, as we have now...

577
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:51,842
the capitalists push the burden
onto the workers.

578
00:42:52,578 --> 00:42:54,605
Look at the situation now.

579
00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:56,681
We've seen it time and again.

580
00:42:56,749 --> 00:42:59,880
Whenever there's a crisis
in the capitalist system...

581
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:03,357
it's not the owner who's fired,
or the manager.

582
00:43:03,556 --> 00:43:07,428
No! They start at the bottom.
The workers are the first to go.

583
00:43:07,593 --> 00:43:09,256
They're put on short time.

584
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:12,199
Fringe benefits are cut. Taxes are raised.

585
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:15,165
That's what we're experiencing now.

586
00:43:15,235 --> 00:43:17,865
And your husband refused to accept it.

587
00:43:18,704 --> 00:43:21,972
In the wrong way, admittedly,
as my husband said...

588
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:24,405
but...

589
00:43:24,777 --> 00:43:27,943
driven by a feeling
that something had to be done.

590
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:30,678
And he could have been helped...

591
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:34,688
if he had had the right people on his side.

592
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:39,421
Your husband must have been sensitive...

593
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:43,223
to the mood of crisis among the workers.

594
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:49,631
One thing I do know.

595
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:53,670
He didn't kill that man
just to liberate himself.

596
00:43:55,506 --> 00:43:57,943
He wanted to help the others, too.

597
00:43:58,743 --> 00:44:01,078
Oh, thank you, thank you.

598
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:03,815
You put that so nicely.

599
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:07,214
That's certainly how it was.

600
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:10,523
Hermann always stuck his neck
out for others.

601
00:44:10,588 --> 00:44:14,585
He defended everyone and said
you have to see the good in people.

602
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:18,828
That's the kind of thing my Hermann said.

603
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,335
Not so long ago, he said,
"Now they'll be laying some of us off.

604
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:26,338
"The foreign workers
will be the first to go...

605
00:44:26,504 --> 00:44:28,599
"and it hits them hardest."

606
00:44:30,474 --> 00:44:33,037
He always thought of other people...

607
00:44:33,177 --> 00:44:34,942
and of himself last.

608
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:48,519
Your husband had the right idea,
but went about it in the wrong way.

609
00:44:48,592 --> 00:44:50,585
If he'd been one of us...

610
00:44:50,661 --> 00:44:52,563
he'd have had people...

611
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:55,328
who could have explained things to him.

612
00:44:58,336 --> 00:44:59,702
One of you?

613
00:45:00,704 --> 00:45:02,435
I don't understand.

614
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:06,374
Yes, Mrs. Küsters. We are Communists.

615
00:45:08,712 --> 00:45:11,650
We are members
of the German Communist Party.

616
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:14,513
But my Hermann was never a Communist.

617
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,050
He was always against them.

618
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,423
He said they're troublemakers
who ruin everything...

619
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,656
who are out to destroy
everything we've built up.

620
00:45:24,928 --> 00:45:26,123
Yes...

621
00:45:26,596 --> 00:45:29,192
that's what people are told about us.

622
00:45:29,432 --> 00:45:31,129
We are depicted...

623
00:45:31,635 --> 00:45:34,128
as villains and enemies of the state.

624
00:45:34,204 --> 00:45:35,433
And why?

625
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,268
Because we say...

626
00:45:39,076 --> 00:45:40,978
what everyone's thinking anyway.

627
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:44,414
Because we uncover the abuses
inherent in the system.

628
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:46,676
And certain people don't like that.

629
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:49,016
The parties, the government...

630
00:45:49,518 --> 00:45:50,987
big industry.

631
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:55,192
A lot of our comrades suffer
for being party members.

632
00:45:55,658 --> 00:45:59,564
They're kept out of certain professions,
prevented from working...

633
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:01,757
or becoming civil servants.

634
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:07,394
Just imagine...

635
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:12,834
a person's not allowed to work,
because he thinks differently!

636
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:17,272
We just want to help people
see the conditions they're living in.

637
00:46:17,947 --> 00:46:19,313
That's all.

638
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:22,849
But we're doing all right.

639
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:27,720
People are content with what they have.

640
00:46:29,825 --> 00:46:32,227
Maybe it's all way above my head.

641
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:35,799
Well, I'd better be going.

642
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:39,965
I'm sure you have better things
to do than talk to an old woman...

643
00:46:41,037 --> 00:46:43,701
and I still have so much to take care of.

644
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:46,710
Thanks for having me.
It made me feel better.

645
00:46:47,609 --> 00:46:49,738
It's good to talk to people.

646
00:46:50,146 --> 00:46:51,546
Really good!

647
00:46:56,618 --> 00:46:58,315
Don't cry, please!

648
00:46:58,987 --> 00:47:01,116
You're welcome here anytime.

649
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,694
And if you ever feel lost
or have any questions...

650
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:06,284
give us a call.

651
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:09,727
We'll always be there for you.

652
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:12,067
Come whenever you like.

653
00:47:14,636 --> 00:47:17,368
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

654
00:47:27,182 --> 00:47:28,650
I called him.

655
00:47:29,184 --> 00:47:31,484
We're going there this evening.

656
00:47:38,126 --> 00:47:40,096
Benno's all hot for you.

657
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:45,294
Anyway, they have a lovely place
full of precious things.

658
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:47,400
Really posh!

659
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,930
I thought they were millionaires.

660
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:52,634
When they said they were Communists...

661
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:54,638
I was flabbergasted.

662
00:47:54,808 --> 00:47:57,803
I always thought
Communists were dirt poor.

663
00:47:59,847 --> 00:48:02,410
There are Communists and Communists.

664
00:48:03,283 --> 00:48:05,720
Like everywhere else in the world.

665
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:09,916
There are poor ones and rich ones...

666
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:14,492
even among Communists.

667
00:48:16,096 --> 00:48:18,430
It's the same in East Germany.

668
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,331
The party bosses...

669
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:26,401
have their villas and can buy exotic fruits.
The others...

670
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:29,376
don't have enough bread.

671
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,772
And even that...

672
00:48:34,514 --> 00:48:35,915
is rationed.

673
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:41,021
Dad wasn't crazy at all
to do what he did, they said.

674
00:48:41,821 --> 00:48:43,791
He saw no other way out.

675
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:47,621
The Communists could have helped him.

676
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:50,988
Mom, don't fall for that!

677
00:48:52,498 --> 00:48:54,491
It's way above your head.

678
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:57,467
Leave that to others.

679
00:48:58,404 --> 00:49:01,570
They're decent people,
friendly and attentive.

680
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:03,975
They looked after me.

681
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:07,742
And I'm grateful for every kind word.

682
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:11,077
They're armchair Communists.

683
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:14,382
I know dozens of that sort from Munich.

684
00:49:14,486 --> 00:49:17,458
They blather on about revolution...

685
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:20,358
and what should be done for the workers...

686
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:23,463
but most of them
don't know a genuine worker.

687
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:27,965
They should go to the factories
and do something.

688
00:49:29,768 --> 00:49:32,399
But that's a different kettle of fish.

689
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:35,805
Don't be so hard on them.
These people are different.

690
00:49:35,874 --> 00:49:39,678
They're educated and not snobbish.
I noticed that right away.

691
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:43,913
Stay away from people like that.
They're up to no good, Mom.

692
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,145
Okay?

693
00:49:50,956 --> 00:49:53,188
At least they talked to me...

694
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,423
and took care of me.

695
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,530
Karl?

696
00:50:07,606 --> 00:50:08,665
Yes?

697
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:12,435
Aren't we expecting too much of her?

698
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,808
Of whom?

699
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:19,674
Mother Küsters.

700
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,452
Who have we been talking about?

701
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:27,025
Sorry, my thoughts were elsewhere.

702
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:32,924
I think we're asking too much of her.

703
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:38,270
She was still shaken by the funeral
and then...

704
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,201
all those theories.

705
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:45,007
No, Marianne. It was perfectly all right.

706
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:47,309
I watched her closely.

707
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:49,715
She listened intently...

708
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,316
and took a lot of it in.

709
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,318
And don't forget, she's lonely...

710
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,080
so she's glad...

711
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,287
to be able to talk to someone.

712
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:05,357
She can't expect much from her family.

713
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,501
Old people tend to be mistrustful.

714
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:13,461
I think we scared her off.

715
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:17,533
She has always been warned
about Communists, and now...

716
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:30,414
she'll keep well out of our way.

717
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:34,922
She'll come back to us one day.

718
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,893
I'm sure.

719
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:04,084
In principle, anyone can perform here...

720
00:52:05,855 --> 00:52:07,791
as long as they have...

721
00:52:08,257 --> 00:52:10,751
some musical ability.

722
00:52:12,228 --> 00:52:14,961
I'm not interested in political beliefs.

723
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:18,592
The main thing
is that the audience listens...

724
00:52:20,802 --> 00:52:22,169
and drinks.

725
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,203
And not too little, either!

726
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:33,615
But you have a certain aura,
as one can see.

727
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:37,079
And you sing, too?

728
00:52:37,652 --> 00:52:38,677
But...

729
00:52:38,754 --> 00:52:41,555
It doesn't matter whether you can or not.

730
00:52:42,524 --> 00:52:43,719
Really?

731
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:46,786
- I thought-
- You thought!

732
00:52:48,263 --> 00:52:49,527
Thinking!

733
00:52:50,632 --> 00:52:52,898
Thinking? Who thinks nowadays?

734
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,119
And people who sing certainly don't think.

735
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,522
Thank God!

736
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,253
Am I right or am I right?

737
00:53:21,662 --> 00:53:22,857
Both...

738
00:53:23,597 --> 00:53:24,826
but...

739
00:53:30,305 --> 00:53:31,705
Philosophy.

740
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:35,506
Don't touch it, Jörg!

741
00:53:37,478 --> 00:53:39,505
That won't buy you a meal.

742
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:47,449
I write my own lyrics.

743
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:49,491
Oh, that doesn't matter.

744
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:53,127
Beggars can't be choosers.

745
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:58,860
But I did choose!

746
00:53:58,933 --> 00:54:01,062
That's what they all think.

747
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:04,896
And they're all fooling themselves.

748
00:54:06,807 --> 00:54:09,141
Okay, when do you want to start?

749
00:54:10,144 --> 00:54:11,669
I don't know...

750
00:54:12,512 --> 00:54:13,741
maybe...

751
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:18,346
She wants to start as soon as possible.

752
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,381
I see.

753
00:54:20,987 --> 00:54:22,149
I see.

754
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:24,392
Then let's say Saturday.

755
00:54:24,824 --> 00:54:27,387
At least it'll be jam-packed.

756
00:54:29,496 --> 00:54:32,935
The first show around 11:00,
the second at 1:00.

757
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:34,662
Is that all right?

758
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:38,400
Sure it's all right!
They're the only rights we have here.

759
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:41,142
I must get back to work.

760
00:54:41,774 --> 00:54:44,473
Cooking the books, if you get my drift.

761
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:46,737
Well then, all the best.

762
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,909
Goodbye!

763
00:54:53,086 --> 00:54:54,179
Yes?

764
00:54:57,957 --> 00:54:59,859
The ads with your name?

765
00:55:02,228 --> 00:55:04,562
That business with your father.

766
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,324
Will that be okay?

767
00:55:08,001 --> 00:55:09,162
Yes...

768
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:11,731
that's okay with me.

769
00:55:23,048 --> 00:55:26,715
"How could a seemingly quiet worker...

770
00:55:27,586 --> 00:55:30,022
"turn into a bloodthirsty monster?

771
00:55:31,423 --> 00:55:33,620
"Was Hermann K. really the man...

772
00:55:33,692 --> 00:55:37,028
his co-workers and bosses knew?

773
00:55:38,263 --> 00:55:41,896
"A glance at his private life reveals...

774
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:45,064
"who Hermann K. really was.

"what was he like

00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:57,117
"A tyrant with an uncontrollable temper.

779
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,809
"A drunkard, feared by his family.

782

"'He was kind-hearted, always nice
and quiet and helpful to everyone. '

784
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:18,999
"But even she is forced to admit
that he drank...

785
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,063
"and was often violent...

786

"But the clearest picture of Hermann K...

791
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:41,489
"comes from his daughter.

00:56:41,759 --> 00:56:43,661
"She calls herself Corinna Coren...

"'I studied, but my father
was always against it."'

799
00:57:03,813 --> 00:57:05,783
What do you say to that?

800
00:57:07,018 --> 00:57:08,486
What should I say?

801
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:10,316
What that man wrote!

802
00:57:10,654 --> 00:57:11,917
Mother...

803
00:57:12,256 --> 00:57:14,158
that's how things are.

804
00:57:14,258 --> 00:57:18,255
He said he wouldn't write
anything bad about Dad...

805
00:57:18,595 --> 00:57:20,063
and now this!

806
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,827
It's all invented!

807
00:57:21,965 --> 00:57:23,457
A pack of lies!

808
00:57:23,533 --> 00:57:25,799
It's his job to create sensations.

809
00:57:25,869 --> 00:57:27,998
Everyone has to make a living.

810
00:57:28,071 --> 00:57:31,407
People forget it as soon as they've read it.

811
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:34,743
Who really knew Father anyway?

812
00:57:35,245 --> 00:57:39,653
You knew him. I knew him.
And you know very well it's not true.

813
00:57:39,816 --> 00:57:41,409
As well as I do.

814
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,988
And you even defend that person.
You don't care about Dad.

815
00:57:45,055 --> 00:57:48,619
You, his own daughter,
carrying on with a man like that!

816
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,527
He's done a lot for me.

817
00:57:51,694 --> 00:57:53,425
He has connections...

818
00:57:53,495 --> 00:57:56,331
and I have to look out for myself,
and Father's dead.

819
00:57:56,398 --> 00:57:58,095
Yes, Dad's dead...

820
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:00,268
but I'm alive.

821
00:58:00,336 --> 00:58:03,172
I'm still alive, Corinna!
And I swear to you...

822
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:05,675
one day I'll call them to account.

823
00:58:08,744 --> 00:58:12,012
Mark your old mother's words!
I owe it to Dad.

824
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,490
My dear Mrs. Küsters,
I received the letter...

825
00:58:21,557 --> 00:58:23,891
you so kindly sent me.

826
00:58:24,026 --> 00:58:27,761
We've considered the matter closely
in the works council...

827
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,993
and even at a board meeting.

828
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:34,672
We all understand your grief,
and we realize...

829
00:58:34,737 --> 00:58:37,537
what a terrible blow it was for you.

830
00:58:38,173 --> 00:58:42,443
But we concluded
that we cannot accede to your request.

831
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:44,947
Let me explain briefly.

832
00:58:46,115 --> 00:58:48,449
A works pension is paid...

833
00:58:48,516 --> 00:58:52,924
only when an employee is killed
in an industrial accident.

834
00:58:53,788 --> 00:58:57,660
In your husband's case,
there was no accident.

835
00:58:57,725 --> 00:58:59,695
He was himself to blame.

836
00:58:59,794 --> 00:59:03,427
Added to which he killed Dr. Berthold...

837
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:06,802
causing serious harm publicly...

838
00:59:06,868 --> 00:59:09,704
to the firm and the staff.

839
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:17,342
The publicity has seriously affected
industrial relations.

840
00:59:19,547 --> 00:59:21,379
I can assure you...

841
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:23,885
you have no legal claim.

842
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:29,287
The secretary of the chemical
workers' union confirmed that.

843
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:34,055
As you can see,
I've explored all possibilities.

844
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:37,158
I am very sorry.

845
00:59:37,231 --> 00:59:39,030
You needn't be sorry.

846
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:41,528
You needn't be sorry at all.

847
00:59:41,803 --> 00:59:43,533
I have my two hands.

848
00:59:43,603 --> 00:59:45,038
I'll manage.

849
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,167
Well, thanks a lot, Mr...

850
00:59:48,508 --> 00:59:49,840
Holzapfel.

851
01:00:05,992 --> 01:00:08,930
- But what are you doing? Why?
- I'm moving out, Mother.

852
01:00:08,995 --> 01:00:11,432
But why? There's enough room here.

853
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,803
Don't worry about me. I'll manage.

854
01:00:15,268 --> 01:00:17,170
Don't you like it here?

855
01:00:17,504 --> 01:00:21,638
Of course I like it.
But I don't get along with Helene, and...

856
01:00:22,075 --> 01:00:24,706
Helene! This is my home, not Helene's.

857
01:00:25,477 --> 01:00:27,607
Now everyone's deserting me.

858
01:00:27,948 --> 01:00:30,043
I'll come to visit, Mother.

859
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,379
But I also need to be alone.

860
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:34,483
Everyone needs that.

861
01:00:35,354 --> 01:00:38,919
- Everyone needs a place of their own.
- I understand you.

862
01:00:40,492 --> 01:00:44,330
Don't cry, Mother. I don't like it
when you cry. Please don't cry!

863
01:00:44,396 --> 01:00:46,628
You're moving in with
that man, aren't you?

864
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:48,601
Mom! It's my life.

865
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:51,230
I'm not the youngest anymore...

866
01:00:52,938 --> 01:00:55,273
and Ernst and Helene will be back soon...

867
01:00:55,342 --> 01:00:57,642
and you won't be alone anymore.

868
01:00:57,877 --> 01:00:59,847
It's all right, my dear.

869
01:01:09,088 --> 01:01:12,185
If you don't mind,
I'd like to come and see you.

870
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:14,985
I need to talk to someone.

871
01:01:15,527 --> 01:01:17,497
My daughter's left, too.

872
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,893
Now I'm all alone.

873
01:01:20,933 --> 01:01:23,460
We told you, you're welcome anytime.

874
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:27,742
Mrs. Küsters. She wants to come by.

875
01:01:27,806 --> 01:01:29,776
We'd be delighted, Mrs. Küsters.

876
01:01:32,978 --> 01:01:35,346
I'll be right there. It's not far.

877
01:01:35,413 --> 01:01:37,212
Thanks. See you soon.

878
01:01:57,568 --> 01:01:59,629
Come in, Mrs. Küsters!

879
01:02:01,406 --> 01:02:05,140
I'll show you something,
and you can tell me what you think.

880
01:02:08,212 --> 01:02:10,409
- I'll make you some coffee.
- Thanks.

881
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:12,143
This is my paper.

882
01:02:13,017 --> 01:02:17,048
I've written an article
that also deals with your husband's case.

883
01:02:17,922 --> 01:02:20,894
You know that dreadful story
they published in that magazine?

884
01:02:20,959 --> 01:02:23,692
I want you to compare it
with what I wrote.

885
01:02:23,795 --> 01:02:25,593
Yes, it was terrible.

886
01:02:27,031 --> 01:02:28,294
Terrible!

887
01:02:29,399 --> 01:02:32,030
When I read it, everything was a blur.

888
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:34,298
I felt all dizzy.

889
01:02:34,973 --> 01:02:36,635
And I trusted him!

890
01:02:37,275 --> 01:02:38,766
The swine...

891
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:40,175
the filthy swine!

892
01:02:40,244 --> 01:02:43,683
He's not a human being,
that reporter, he's an animal.

893
01:02:44,115 --> 01:02:46,813
He wanted to write the truth, he said...

894
01:02:46,984 --> 01:02:49,285
the truth about Hermann.

895
01:02:51,621 --> 01:02:54,525
He was quiet and even-tempered,
my Hermann.

896
01:02:56,593 --> 01:02:59,656
Now he's portrayed
as a drunkard and a bully...

897
01:03:00,897 --> 01:03:05,133
- and he can't defend himself anymore.
- Your husband must be rehabilitated...

898
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:06,694
his name cleared!

899
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:09,503
That's why my husband wrote the article.

900
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:12,670
Read it yourself!

901
01:03:41,204 --> 01:03:43,401
That's better, much better!

902
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,869
What you've written is true.

903
01:03:49,212 --> 01:03:51,307
But who'll read it?

904
01:03:52,581 --> 01:03:54,380
That's only read by...

905
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,282
Not very many yet...

906
01:03:56,886 --> 01:03:58,617
but more every day.

907
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:01,255
And time, Mother Küsters...

908
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:03,288
time is on our side.

909
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:07,093
It would be good, very good,
if lots of people would read this...

910
01:04:07,163 --> 01:04:09,497
and not just the magazine story.

911
01:04:09,932 --> 01:04:11,731
But that's how it is.

912
01:04:12,201 --> 01:04:14,000
We're in God's hands.

913
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,101
No, Mother Küsters.

914
01:04:17,206 --> 01:04:19,837
It's not God-given the way things are.

915
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:22,009
Things can be changed.

916
01:04:22,078 --> 01:04:23,740
And any change...

917
01:04:25,014 --> 01:04:27,109
can only be for the better.

918
01:04:27,482 --> 01:04:29,611
- But God-
- God is God...

919
01:04:31,653 --> 01:04:33,282
and life is life.

920
01:04:34,556 --> 01:04:37,619
And people are responsible
for their own lives.

921
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:41,027
I don't know...

922
01:04:41,096 --> 01:04:42,963
Maybe you're right.

923
01:04:43,932 --> 01:04:46,027
But what you wrote is good.

924
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:48,097
I thank you for it.

925
01:04:48,436 --> 01:04:50,497
You don't have to thank me.

926
01:04:50,572 --> 01:04:52,701
It was no more than my duty.

927
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:02,378
It didn't stop raining,
and it didn't get properly light.

928
01:05:02,449 --> 01:05:04,545
You should have gone south.

929
01:05:04,819 --> 01:05:06,789
It rains in the south, too.

930
01:05:06,855 --> 01:05:10,316
He did nothing but complain
and was in a terrible mood.

931
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:12,093
With that weather!

932
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,494
There are lovely woods up there.

933
01:05:15,029 --> 01:05:17,329
He was just too lazy to go for a walk.

934
01:05:17,397 --> 01:05:19,367
If you slave away all year...

935
01:05:19,433 --> 01:05:22,132
you want a restful, lazy vacation.

936
01:05:22,769 --> 01:05:24,864
I slave away all year, too.

937
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,439
But sitting down.

938
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:28,973
Oh, yes! Mother and son!

939
01:05:29,043 --> 01:05:31,104
Stick together!

940
01:05:31,745 --> 01:05:34,080
I'm not taking any more of this.

941
01:05:34,815 --> 01:05:37,218
Always arguing, ganging up on me.

942
01:05:38,552 --> 01:05:40,077
I'm moving out!

943
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,853
You can stay with your mother.
I'll manage.

944
01:05:43,991 --> 01:05:45,186
But...

945
01:05:48,395 --> 01:05:52,129
She doesn't mean it, Mom.
She's just sore about the vacation.

946
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:54,636
It didn't turn out as she'd planned.

947
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,228
She doesn't like being in the wrong.

948
01:05:57,771 --> 01:05:59,296
And in her condition!

949
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,641
I had children, too,
but I didn't behave like that.

950
01:06:02,776 --> 01:06:04,905
Nobody's done anything to her.

951
01:06:04,978 --> 01:06:06,537
I'm moving out.

952
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:09,844
That does it! I'll show you!

953
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:21,395
Hello, I saw your ad in the paper.

954
01:06:21,794 --> 01:06:24,095
You have a furnished apartment?

955
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,630
Yes, I'd be interested. Is it quiet?

956
01:06:29,303 --> 01:06:30,635
Oh, I see.

957
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:33,707
That's too bad. Goodbye!

958
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:40,304
- Ernst?
- Yes?

959
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,941
You planned this during your vacation.
Moving out.

960
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:47,848
But, Mom!

961
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:51,055
Never mind!

962
01:06:52,825 --> 01:06:54,350
It's all right.

963
01:06:55,795 --> 01:06:56,785
Hello?

964
01:06:56,862 --> 01:06:59,332
Yes, I'm looking for something furnished.

965
01:06:59,397 --> 01:07:01,367
Three rooms if possible.

966
01:07:02,335 --> 01:07:03,360
No?

967
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:05,667
Well, thanks anyway.

968
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:07,100
Goodbye!

969
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:15,940
All the same, I'll manage!

970
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:19,009
Me, too, Helene!

971
01:07:19,085 --> 01:07:20,713
I'll manage, too.

972
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,452
Even if you all desert me,
it doesn't matter.

973
01:07:23,521 --> 01:07:26,118
On the contrary, it gives me strength.

974
01:07:26,391 --> 01:07:30,161
I promised Dad into his grave
that I'd cherish his memory.

975
01:07:31,429 --> 01:07:33,524
You two couldn't care less.

976
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:36,099
But I'm going to fight.

977
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:38,262
What kind of talk is that, Mom?

978
01:07:38,337 --> 01:07:40,933
And what does it have to do with Dad?

979
01:07:42,607 --> 01:07:44,337
That's my business.

980
01:07:44,709 --> 01:07:47,476
And now I even ask you both to move out.

981
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,071
I ask you to.

982
01:07:54,586 --> 01:07:55,849
But, Mom!

983
01:08:04,029 --> 01:08:06,363
- Well, Helene? Have a good rest?
- Not bad.

984
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,833
To what do we owe the honor
of your visit?

985
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,735
I just want to pick up some stuff I forgot.

986
01:08:12,037 --> 01:08:14,234
Don't worry! I'm going again.

987
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:16,270
What's going on here?

988
01:08:16,807 --> 01:08:18,037
No idea!

989
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:21,377
- Mom's just talking nonsense.
- I'm not talking nonsense!

990
01:08:21,779 --> 01:08:24,410
- Never mind, Mom, we're all nuts.
- Maybe you are.

991
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:26,451
I've got my wits about me.

992
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:28,953
Mom keeps talking about fighting.

993
01:08:29,321 --> 01:08:31,314
Do you know what it's all about?

994
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:33,881
Leave her! She has her own notions.

995
01:08:34,024 --> 01:08:36,757
Mom, today's my first show in Frankfurt.

996
01:08:36,927 --> 01:08:39,363
Want to come? With Ernst and Helene?

997
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:43,199
- Thanks. I'd rather stay at home.
- Then you come with Ernst.

998
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,093
If you think so.

999
01:08:45,169 --> 01:08:46,832
And if Ernst goes.

1000
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:53,103
Great! See you tonight! Bye!

1001
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:59,381
Singing! Don't make me laugh!

1002
01:09:10,927 --> 01:09:13,296
You see, I'm all international tonight.

1003
01:09:13,363 --> 01:09:16,802
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a sensation for you.

1004
01:09:17,067 --> 01:09:19,833
Something that's never been seen before!

1005
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:23,706
Ladies and gentlemen,
what I'm presenting tonight...

1006
01:09:24,374 --> 01:09:26,936
is more than just a smash hit.

1007
01:09:28,678 --> 01:09:31,080
It's nothing less than a miracle!

1008
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:35,215
A slip of a girl...

1009
01:09:35,618 --> 01:09:37,588
but with such a voice...

1010
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:41,422
with so much power and drive,
so much strength,

1011
01:09:41,758 --> 01:09:43,921
she'll bring the house down.

1012
01:09:44,193 --> 01:09:46,824
You'll get your money's worth tonight.

1013
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:49,526
I present to you...

1014
01:09:49,598 --> 01:09:53,972
I don't want to brag too much,
or I might disappoint you.

1015
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,470
At fairs, they used to show
the female torso...

1016
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,069
and the bearded lady. Do you remember?

1017
01:10:01,144 --> 01:10:03,671
The lady with three breasts...

1018
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:07,450
None of that I can offer you tonight.

1019
01:10:08,184 --> 01:10:10,484
What I can offer is something more.

1020
01:10:10,552 --> 01:10:12,545
An experience, a sensation.

1021
01:10:12,621 --> 01:10:15,616
Polish your glasses! Loosen your ties!

1022
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:17,182
That's right!

1023
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:22,595
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you today, here, at this hour...

1024
01:10:22,664 --> 01:10:24,155
the sensation!

1025
01:10:26,034 --> 01:10:27,367
Ladies and gentlemen...

1026
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:30,772
I present to you
not the living female torso.

1027
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,605
I present to you...

1028
01:10:35,911 --> 01:10:38,508
the daughter of the factory murderer!

1029
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:42,650
Oh, my God!

1030
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:46,555
How can they allow that?

1031
01:10:48,056 --> 01:10:49,889
Here she is!

1032
01:11:03,938 --> 01:11:06,501
<i>The streets, they stink</i>

1033
01:11:06,574 --> 01:11:08,635
<i>of dirt and shit</i>

1034
01:11:08,909 --> 01:11:11,142
<i>My chances sink</i>

1035
01:11:11,378 --> 01:11:13,871
<i>'cause Fred has quit</i>

1036
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:16,613
<i>The sun is low</i>

1037
01:11:16,784 --> 01:11:19,152
<i>He let me go</i>

1038
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,657
<i>I'm digging my grave</i>

1039
01:11:21,722 --> 01:11:23,419
<i>and no one says "no"</i>

1040
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:25,825
<i>says "no", says "no"</i>

1041
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:31,995
<i>Men, they forget</i>

1042
01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:34,263
<i>us women so quick.</i>

1043
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:36,665
<i>That skin of theirs</i>

1044
01:11:36,737 --> 01:11:38,900
<i>is so damned thick</i>

1045
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,506
<i>Women are women</i>

1046
01:11:41,574 --> 01:11:43,977
<i>from their heads to their toes</i>

1047
01:11:44,044 --> 01:11:46,378
<i>But sadly, with men</i>

1048
01:11:46,446 --> 01:11:49,043
<i>you're not clear how it goes</i>

1049
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:57,084
<i>They brag about courage</i>

1050
01:11:57,657 --> 01:11:59,820
<i>they don't really have</i>

1051
01:12:00,027 --> 01:12:02,122
<i>Then they take their bow</i>

1052
01:12:02,196 --> 01:12:05,191
<i>without asking your leave</i>

1053
01:12:05,365 --> 01:12:08,029
<i>My Fred was all right</i>

1054
01:12:08,202 --> 01:12:10,331
<i>his kisses were sweet</i>

1055
01:12:10,703 --> 01:12:14,005
<i>When he lost all restraint lying</i>

1056
01:12:14,073 --> 01:12:17,204
<i>under my sheet</i>

1057
01:12:19,846 --> 01:12:22,112
<i>But a guy caught his eye</i>

1058
01:12:22,215 --> 01:12:24,344
<i>and he gave me the boot</i>

1059
01:12:24,517 --> 01:12:26,749
<i>What could I do</i>

1060
01:12:26,819 --> 01:12:28,948
<i>but part with the brute?</i>

1061
01:12:29,022 --> 01:12:31,619
<i>I want a new man</i>

1062
01:12:31,691 --> 01:12:34,423
<i>a real one with zest</i>

1063
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:39,100
<i>Who knows a girl's worth</i>

1064
01:12:39,165 --> 01:12:42,228
<i>when she's giving her best</i>

1065
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:47,037
<i>Men, they forget</i>

1066
01:12:47,106 --> 01:12:49,235
<i>us women so quick</i>

1067
01:12:49,341 --> 01:12:51,038
<i>That skin of theirs</i>

1068
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,376
<i>is so damned thick</i>

1069
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:55,141
<i>Women are women</i>

1070
01:12:55,214 --> 01:12:57,446
<i>from their heads to their toes</i>

1071
01:12:57,516 --> 01:12:59,315
<i>But sadly, with men</i>

1072
01:12:59,384 --> 01:13:01,854
<i>you're not clear how it goes</i>

1073
01:13:07,526 --> 01:13:09,428
Come on, Mom! Let's go!

1074
01:13:16,969 --> 01:13:20,169
I checked out the place.
It's a perfect location.

1075
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:24,106
Near the opera house facing away
from the street, and quiet.

1076
01:13:24,543 --> 01:13:26,740
Just what I've always wanted.

1077
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:28,676
Then you were lucky.

1078
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:33,919
The tram stops just round the corner.
I can get to work in ten minutes.

1079
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:38,520
The furniture's nothing special,
but it'll do for now.

1080
01:13:39,423 --> 01:13:42,623
We can add things as we go along,
or replace them.

1081
01:13:43,028 --> 01:13:46,057
And we can move in tomorrow!

1082
01:13:46,764 --> 01:13:49,361
Ernst, your wife's in an awful hurry.

1083
01:13:50,268 --> 01:13:52,636
Don't be sad, Mom. It's not far.

1084
01:13:52,703 --> 01:13:55,436
We can phone, and you can come visit.

1085
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:58,805
Chin up, my boy! Don't worry about me!

1086
01:14:00,245 --> 01:14:02,545
Come on, dear! We have to pack!

1087
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,648
Ernst!

1088
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:40,985
Mrs. Küsters!

1089
01:14:41,052 --> 01:14:43,488
I was just walking past...

1090
01:14:43,553 --> 01:14:46,753
and I thought I'd ring.
I hope you don't mind?

1091
01:14:46,957 --> 01:14:50,361
On the contrary, Mrs. Küsters.
We're always glad to see you.

1092
01:14:50,427 --> 01:14:53,957
Would you like something to eat?
I've just made some sandwiches.

1093
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,659
- Thanks.
- Come in!

1094
01:14:57,234 --> 01:14:59,204
It's all so hard for me.

1095
01:15:00,637 --> 01:15:04,668
When you have someone at your side
for 30 years...

1096
01:15:05,175 --> 01:15:07,738
you don't need to talk much.

1097
01:15:08,878 --> 01:15:11,611
And the worries weigh only half as much.

1098
01:15:11,781 --> 01:15:14,480
Why don't you come to us
with your troubles?

1099
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,953
The main thing is to get them off
your chest.

1100
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,990
Yes. I feel so lonely...

1101
01:15:19,589 --> 01:15:21,650
so abandoned by everybody.

1102
01:15:21,858 --> 01:15:23,953
Since my husband's death...

1103
01:15:24,094 --> 01:15:26,428
the whole family's broken apart.

1104
01:15:27,063 --> 01:15:29,694
My daughter was always on the move...

1105
01:15:29,766 --> 01:15:32,566
but I thought,
now that she works in Frankfurt...

1106
01:15:32,634 --> 01:15:34,969
she could at least live with me.

1107
01:15:35,305 --> 01:15:40,077
Even if she does work in that dive
and drags her father's name in the mud.

1108
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:43,073
And now my son...

1109
01:15:43,213 --> 01:15:45,479
has moved out with his wife...

1110
01:15:46,982 --> 01:15:49,852
and I'm all alone in that big apartment...

1111
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,416
talking to myself.

1112
01:15:56,259 --> 01:15:59,493
- Good evening, Mr...
- Good evening, Mrs. Küsters!

1113
01:15:59,862 --> 01:16:03,096
I happened to be passing
and I thought I'd ring.

1114
01:16:04,032 --> 01:16:05,661
Yes, that's fine.

1115
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:07,903
Why don't you come along with us?

1116
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:11,671
We're meeting some comrades
for a glass of wine and a chat.

1117
01:16:13,242 --> 01:16:16,682
But I'm not prepared,
and I'm not dressed right.

1118
01:16:16,912 --> 01:16:18,814
Nonsense, Mrs. Küsters!

1119
01:16:18,981 --> 01:16:23,889
Things like that are not important to us.
Outward appearances don't count with us.

1120
01:16:23,952 --> 01:16:25,614
Well, all right...

1121
01:16:26,155 --> 01:16:27,920
if you don't mind...

1122
01:16:28,023 --> 01:16:29,355
I'll come.

1123
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,353
Hello, Mom!

1124
01:17:00,421 --> 01:17:02,151
I thought I'd drop by.

1125
01:17:02,223 --> 01:17:04,022
That's nice. Come in!

1126
01:17:04,692 --> 01:17:07,060
- How are things with you?
- So so.

1127
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:09,426
How's the little one?

1128
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:12,461
Good. He screams like all babies.

1129
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,328
That's how it is.

1130
01:17:22,475 --> 01:17:24,069
And how are you?

1131
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,439
Oh, you know.

1132
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:29,675
I'm alone a lot.

1133
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:35,214
I'm sorry about that, Mom.

1134
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:39,557
Nonsense! You don't have to be sorry.
It has its good sides.

1135
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:42,726
You have time to think when you're alone.

1136
01:17:43,396 --> 01:17:44,489
Yes.

1137
01:17:46,234 --> 01:17:49,638
- You know, I've joined the Party.
- What party?

1138
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:52,873
The German Communist Party.

1139
01:17:53,206 --> 01:17:54,470
But, Mom!

1140
01:17:55,275 --> 01:17:56,972
You needn't worry.

1141
01:17:57,944 --> 01:18:00,814
They're ordinary people. They talk to me...

1142
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:03,208
and they take me seriously.

1143
01:18:03,283 --> 01:18:05,481
Yes, they take me seriously.

1144
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:10,153
I don't know much about politics,
but they try hard to explain it.

1145
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:14,120
The business with Dad, too.

1146
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:20,202
And why?
Out of the kindness of their hearts?

1147
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:22,163
Everybody's out for something.

1148
01:18:22,235 --> 01:18:25,435
Once you realize that,
everything becomes simpler.

1149
01:18:25,504 --> 01:18:27,838
I want them to be nice to me...

1150
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,971
and to talk to me,
and if they want something from me...

1151
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:35,208
that's only fair.

1152
01:18:35,781 --> 01:18:39,015
I don't dare tell Helene. She'll throw a fit.

1153
01:18:39,085 --> 01:18:41,077
You don't have to tell her.

1154
01:18:41,154 --> 01:18:44,023
Just try to understand it yourself.

1155
01:18:44,556 --> 01:18:45,819
I'll try.

1156
01:18:46,659 --> 01:18:49,893
They give me strength
when I sit here all alone...

1157
01:18:50,095 --> 01:18:52,692
with my thoughts eating away at me,
you understand?

1158
01:18:52,765 --> 01:18:54,667
Yes, Mom. I understand you.

1159
01:18:54,733 --> 01:18:56,726
I keep thinking of Dad...

1160
01:18:56,969 --> 01:18:58,563
and what he did.

1161
01:18:59,138 --> 01:19:03,010
And slowly, I begin to understand
why that happened with Dad...

1162
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:05,534
and all those around him.

1163
01:19:05,711 --> 01:19:07,373
And that helps me.

1164
01:19:09,214 --> 01:19:11,343
It's important. You understand?

1165
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:14,252
Sure, Mom.
You know what's important for you.

1166
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,983
I don't blame you.

1167
01:19:17,555 --> 01:19:19,548
I'd better be going. Bye!

1168
01:19:19,757 --> 01:19:23,219
- My love to Helene and the baby!
- I'll tell them, Mom.

1169
01:19:34,106 --> 01:19:37,670
<i>...for socialism can neither
be improvised...</i>

1170
01:19:38,576 --> 01:19:42,311
<i>nor brought about
by a putsch or conspiracy.</i>

1171
01:19:43,348 --> 01:19:45,580
<i>It can only be the outcome...</i>

1172
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:48,918
<i>of struggle of the working classes
and the people.</i>

1173
01:19:49,687 --> 01:19:52,157
<i>What the workers experience...</i>

1174
01:19:52,223 --> 01:19:55,218
<i>in the present state of crisis...</i>

1175
01:19:56,426 --> 01:20:00,298
<i>helps them develop
their class awareness...</i>

1176
01:20:00,999 --> 01:20:04,062
<i>and prepares the ground
for the class struggle.</i>

1177
01:20:04,936 --> 01:20:09,206
<i>The more the Party identifies
itself with the working masses...</i>

1178
01:20:09,273 --> 01:20:12,370
<i>the closer this struggle will come.</i>

1179
01:20:13,744 --> 01:20:15,611
<i>We therefore demand...</i>

1180
01:20:16,413 --> 01:20:18,383
<i>the securing of jobs...</i>

1181
01:20:18,983 --> 01:20:21,955
<i>by increasing mass purchasing power.</i>

1182
01:20:23,254 --> 01:20:26,522
<i>We must put up resistance
in the factories, in municipalities...</i>

1183
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:29,026
<i>on the streets and in the squares.</i>

1184
01:20:29,393 --> 01:20:32,456
<i>We condemn the profiteers
and the big combines.</i>

1185
01:20:33,264 --> 01:20:36,828
<i>Stop the extortion
by multinational oil companies...</i>

1186
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:39,796
<i>which exploit our people...</i>

1187
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:43,642
<i>and destroy jobs with price fixing!</i>

1188
01:20:45,075 --> 01:20:47,478
<i>It's not wages that determine prices.</i>

1189
01:20:47,544 --> 01:20:49,537
<i>It's the monopolies.</i>

1190
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:54,347
<i>No more short-time work
and factory closures!</i>

1191
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,754
<i>We demand an end to mass layoffs!</i>

1192
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:02,419
<i>Dismissals without the provision
of alternative employment...</i>

1193
01:21:02,926 --> 01:21:04,919
<i>must be forbidden by law.</i>

1194
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:10,229
<i>Our Party urges all workers, employees...</i>

1195
01:21:11,134 --> 01:21:14,869
<i>union members, Social Democrats
and Young Socialists...</i>

1196
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:17,204
<i>to join forces in combatting...</i>

1197
01:21:17,307 --> 01:21:19,709
<i>those responsible for the impending...</i>

1198
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:21,574
<i>social crisis.</i>

1199
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:25,779
<i>Not the farming people and workers
are our enemies.</i>

1200
01:21:26,283 --> 01:21:29,585
<i>We all have a common enemy
who robs and exploits us.</i>

1201
01:21:29,952 --> 01:21:31,319
<i>Capitalism.</i>

1202
01:21:32,189 --> 01:21:35,491
<i>Nobody's safe from sackings
and price increases.</i>

1203
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:39,290
<i>Let us act together.
Today rather then tomorrow.</i>

1204
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,886
<i>Let us act now!</i>

1205
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:51,768
<i>Thank you, Comrade Tillmann,
for your interesting remarks.</i>

1206
01:21:52,174 --> 01:21:55,773
<i>Today, we are able to illustrate
his theoretical analysis...</i>

1207
01:21:55,845 --> 01:21:58,715
<i>with an authentic case.</i>

1208
01:21:59,849 --> 01:22:02,719
<i>I'd like to welcome Mother Küsters...</i>

1209
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:05,912
<i>who joined our Party a few weeks ago.</i>

1210
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:10,857
<i>You all know the tragic case of
her husband, Hermann Küsters.</i>

1211
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:14,726
<i>She has volunteered
to speak to you today.</i>

1212
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,518
<i>Good evening, everyone!</i>

1213
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:41,858
<i>This is the first time I've ever
spoken to so many people at once...</i>

1214
01:22:43,057 --> 01:22:46,052
<i>and I'm not as good a speaker
as the others...</i>

1215
01:22:46,794 --> 01:22:49,630
<i>but I can explain, I think...</i>

1216
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:54,596
<i>why I joined this party at my age.</i>

1217
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,499
<i>I must confess...</i>

1218
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:01,333
<i>it's not because of politics,
which I know too little about...</i>

1219
01:23:01,675 --> 01:23:03,976
<i>but because of the people...</i>

1220
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:06,210
<i>I've found among you.</i>

1221
01:23:06,346 --> 01:23:08,543
<i>And these people have told me...</i>

1222
01:23:08,615 --> 01:23:11,815
<i>that we mustn't accept
everything as God-given...</i>

1223
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:15,722
<i>that it's not all fate.</i>

1224
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:19,195
<i>I believe them, and that's why I'm here.</i>

1225
01:23:20,494 --> 01:23:22,487
<i>I have come to realize...</i>

1226
01:23:22,763 --> 01:23:25,200
<i>there's a reason for everything...</i>

1227
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:28,636
<i>for all the terrible things
that happen in the world.</i>

1228
01:23:29,203 --> 01:23:31,936
<i>I was married to my husband for 40 years.</i>

1229
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:34,237
<i>That's a long time...</i>

1230
01:23:34,474 --> 01:23:36,569
<i>but much too short as well.</i>

1231
01:23:36,677 --> 01:23:39,375
<i>Because, what did I do all those years?</i>

1232
01:23:39,446 --> 01:23:41,814
<i>I did what was expected of me...</i>

1233
01:23:42,282 --> 01:23:44,651
<i>what is expected of every woman.</i>

1234
01:23:44,818 --> 01:23:47,414
<i>I had children, kept house and so on.</i>

1235
01:23:48,322 --> 01:23:50,383
<i>And Hermann did...</i>

1236
01:23:50,757 --> 01:23:52,784
<i>what was expected of him.</i>

1237
01:23:53,293 --> 01:23:54,956
<i>He went to work...</i>

1238
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:56,821
<i>went to war...</i>

1239
01:23:57,496 --> 01:23:59,797
<i>And that was the way of things.</i>

1240
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,661
<i>But is that life...</i>

1241
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:04,531
<i>I ask myself now?</i>

1242
01:24:05,404 --> 01:24:08,934
<i>Is that really life? Or did we just live...</i>

1243
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:12,537
<i>in the way others wanted us to live?</i>

1244
01:24:14,114 --> 01:24:16,812
<i>Was that really our life? I don't know.</i>

1245
01:24:17,717 --> 01:24:19,516
<i>Down in the valley...</i>

1246
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:22,383
<i>all you see is the mountain.</i>

1247
01:24:22,788 --> 01:24:24,781
<i>But up on the mountain...</i>

1248
01:24:25,157 --> 01:24:27,218
<i>you can see many valleys...</i>

1249
01:24:27,294 --> 01:24:28,785
<i>and mountains.</i>

1250
01:24:29,495 --> 01:24:30,986
<i>Forty years...</i>

1251
01:24:31,497 --> 01:24:34,435
<i>is a long time for two people
to be together.</i>

1252
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:37,470
<i>I thought I knew him...</i>

1253
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:42,435
<i>and I thought there was no need to talk.
We knew everything there was to know.</i>

1254
01:24:42,507 --> 01:24:44,374
<i>But that's not true...</i>

1255
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:46,238
<i>not true at all.</i>

1256
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:48,572
<i>We have no idea.</i>

1257
01:24:50,382 --> 01:24:54,083
<i>How my husband must have suffered
to have done what he did!</i>

1258
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:56,416
<i>And I knew nothing about it.</i>

1259
01:24:57,555 --> 01:24:59,024
<i>Is that life?</i>

1260
01:24:59,691 --> 01:25:03,062
<i>Other people's problems,
that's what he talked about.</i>

1261
01:25:03,595 --> 01:25:05,827
<i>But we never really learned...</i>

1262
01:25:05,897 --> 01:25:10,236
<i>how to live together, or we weren't able
to get through to each other.</i>

1263
01:25:11,736 --> 01:25:15,642
<i>How desperate he must have been,
not knowing which way to turn!</i>

1264
01:25:15,974 --> 01:25:19,174
<i>He had nobody like you to talk to...</i>

1265
01:25:20,645 --> 01:25:23,344
<i>who might have told him what was right.</i>

1266
01:25:23,782 --> 01:25:26,345
<i>Things would have been different then.</i>

1267
01:25:26,418 --> 01:25:29,618
<i>And he wouldn't
have been used after his death...</i>

1268
01:25:30,188 --> 01:25:33,628
<i>to fill those magazines with lies.</i>

1269
01:25:35,426 --> 01:25:37,453
<i>My husband is no murderer.</i>

1270
01:25:38,797 --> 01:25:40,824
<i>And he's not crazy either.</i>

1271
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:43,193
<i>He's a man who hit back...</i>

1272
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:46,698
<i>because he was beaten all his life.</i>

1273
01:25:47,571 --> 01:25:48,835
<i>Beaten...</i>

1274
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:50,934
<i>and trampled on.</i>

1275
01:25:51,475 --> 01:25:54,038
<i>If it's true what I've heard here...</i>

1276
01:25:54,913 --> 01:25:57,509
<i>that 1 percent of the population...</i>

1277
01:25:57,581 --> 01:26:00,576
<i>owns 80 percent of all wealth...</i>

1278
01:26:01,785 --> 01:26:04,086
<i>then he tried in his own way...</i>

1279
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:06,421
<i>to fight this injustice.</i>

1280
01:26:07,591 --> 01:26:09,356
<i>The way he did it...</i>

1281
01:26:09,827 --> 01:26:11,262
<i>was wrong...</i>

1282
01:26:11,995 --> 01:26:14,523
<i>but I want to make amends for that.</i>

1283
01:26:14,932 --> 01:26:16,595
<i>I, Emma Küsters...</i>

1284
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,066
<i>will join you in your struggle
for justice today.</i>

1285
01:26:35,786 --> 01:26:36,947
Hello!

1286
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:43,852
Congratulations!

1287
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:46,056
What you said was very good.

1288
01:26:46,562 --> 01:26:49,261
Really? I just said...

1289
01:26:49,465 --> 01:26:51,298
what came to my mind.

1290
01:26:52,869 --> 01:26:54,634
Yes, that was right.

1291
01:26:55,338 --> 01:26:57,740
Everything else in there is empty talk.

1292
01:26:57,807 --> 01:27:00,004
I don't know. I like it here.

1293
01:27:01,044 --> 01:27:04,574
Because you think they care about you.
But you're wrong.

1294
01:27:04,647 --> 01:27:05,876
But...

1295
01:27:06,349 --> 01:27:09,719
You're for it with all your heart.
But them in there!

1296
01:27:10,153 --> 01:27:12,020
Take a good look at those people!

1297
01:27:13,356 --> 01:27:16,351
Do you think they mean
all they say, like you?

1298
01:27:16,993 --> 01:27:18,052
Yes.

1299
01:27:18,294 --> 01:27:20,959
That's why I joined the Party.

1300
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,200
Because they misled you.

1301
01:27:23,733 --> 01:27:26,033
They're all talk and no action.

1302
01:27:26,235 --> 01:27:28,000
And so it goes on for years...

1303
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:30,302
until the goals they once had
are forgotten.

1304
01:27:30,372 --> 01:27:33,971
But they want to help me
clear my husband's name!

1305
01:27:34,043 --> 01:27:36,013
You really believe that?

1306
01:27:36,645 --> 01:27:38,946
Sure, I believe you believe it.

1307
01:27:39,148 --> 01:27:42,587
But those people
don't give a shit about your husband.

1308
01:27:43,785 --> 01:27:46,586
When you talk like that, it makes me sad.

1309
01:27:48,124 --> 01:27:51,324
What you need, Mrs. Küsters,
is a striking action.

1310
01:27:51,493 --> 01:27:54,522
Something to make people sit up
and take notice.

1311
01:27:54,963 --> 01:27:57,161
To shake them out of their sleep.

1312
01:27:57,233 --> 01:27:58,428
Action?

1313
01:27:59,534 --> 01:28:01,436
What sort of an action?

1314
01:28:02,737 --> 01:28:04,832
We'd have to consider that.

1315
01:28:04,973 --> 01:28:07,501
But something can certainly be done.

1316
01:28:07,642 --> 01:28:09,771
You can always do something.

1317
01:28:10,345 --> 01:28:12,872
If you ever need me, my name's Knab.

1318
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:17,515
Horst Knab. I live at 24 Westendstrasse.

1319
01:28:17,953 --> 01:28:19,479
You never know.

1320
01:28:22,524 --> 01:28:24,425
Horst Knab, Westend...

1321
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,655
I don't understand a thing.

1322
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:43,108
You impressed them
tremendously, Mrs. Küsters.

1323
01:28:43,178 --> 01:28:44,373
Did I?

1324
01:28:45,213 --> 01:28:46,511
I'm glad.

1325
01:28:47,681 --> 01:28:51,416
It was great, what you said.
It really got under their skin.

1326
01:28:51,685 --> 01:28:55,455
I thought I'd just talk,
as if someone were sitting there...

1327
01:28:56,091 --> 01:28:58,117
listening sympathetically.

1328
01:28:58,726 --> 01:29:00,821
That's all there was to it.

1329
01:29:01,296 --> 01:29:03,698
The people were all very quiet...

1330
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:06,791
and I wasn't afraid anymore.

1331
01:29:06,867 --> 01:29:09,998
Yes, we could tell
you weren't afraid anymore.

1332
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:12,262
That was good.

1333
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,942
When I went outside...

1334
01:29:15,109 --> 01:29:17,637
to the ladies' room...

1335
01:29:17,711 --> 01:29:19,704
someone approached me...

1336
01:29:20,714 --> 01:29:22,911
and said such strange things.

1337
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:25,579
He said I needed an action.

1338
01:29:26,854 --> 01:29:29,188
"An action." That's what he said.

1339
01:29:29,256 --> 01:29:31,385
Knab's his name, Horst Knab.

1340
01:29:34,694 --> 01:29:38,931
He's one of those who want to destroy,
instead of building things up.

1341
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,896
They are people...

1342
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:44,503
we can't even talk with anymore.

1343
01:29:45,405 --> 01:29:48,275
We have nothing to do with them.
They're...

1344
01:29:49,576 --> 01:29:51,569
anarchists, Mrs. Küsters.

1345
01:29:52,912 --> 01:29:54,711
They are our enemies.

1346
01:29:54,881 --> 01:29:56,874
I told him right away...

1347
01:29:57,584 --> 01:29:59,645
I'd joined the Party...

1348
01:29:59,852 --> 01:30:02,949
because I believe
it'll help me with Hermann...

1349
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:04,922
and so on.

1350
01:30:04,991 --> 01:30:08,897
You can rest assured
we will not leave you in the lurch.

1351
01:30:09,395 --> 01:30:11,261
It's not much farther.

1352
01:30:11,396 --> 01:30:12,797
Here we are.

1353
01:30:14,366 --> 01:30:16,199
Thanks for everything!

1354
01:30:16,269 --> 01:30:17,602
Good night!

1355
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,733
Haven't you promised
the woman too much?

1356
01:30:21,808 --> 01:30:24,108
She's just waiting and waiting.

1357
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:37,788
I thought something would happen.

1358
01:30:37,856 --> 01:30:39,485
I sit at home...

1359
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:42,458
but nobody calls, nobody comes by.

1360
01:30:42,527 --> 01:30:44,963
Why doesn't the Party do anything?

1361
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:48,128
We wanted to go to the factories
and tell people the truth...

1362
01:30:48,201 --> 01:30:49,692
about my husband.

1363
01:30:49,768 --> 01:30:51,100
But nothing!

1364
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:54,870
You must be patient, Mrs. Küsters.
It's a slow process.

1365
01:30:55,374 --> 01:30:57,036
But not that slow!

1366
01:30:57,376 --> 01:30:59,106
People forget so quickly.

1367
01:30:59,177 --> 01:31:02,047
If we don't act now, it'll just fade away.

1368
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:03,945
But Mrs. Küsters...

1369
01:31:04,348 --> 01:31:06,250
we can't work miracles.

1370
01:31:06,818 --> 01:31:09,619
We promised to help you, and we will.

1371
01:31:10,622 --> 01:31:14,756
But we must act now,
while it's still fresh in people's minds!

1372
01:31:14,826 --> 01:31:17,058
Why aren't you doing anything?

1373
01:31:18,997 --> 01:31:21,901
My dear Mrs. Küsters, we are very busy.

1374
01:31:24,136 --> 01:31:27,040
We're in the middle
of an election campaign.

1375
01:31:27,906 --> 01:31:30,035
We need to gain new voters.

1376
01:31:30,108 --> 01:31:32,408
That's our main task right now.

1377
01:31:33,377 --> 01:31:37,147
We won't forget you,
but we have to put your case on hold.

1378
01:31:37,882 --> 01:31:40,217
There'll be time enough
after the campaign.

1379
01:31:40,285 --> 01:31:41,913
But I need it now!

1380
01:31:41,986 --> 01:31:44,389
Something has to happen now! Now!

1381
01:31:44,822 --> 01:31:47,157
You can't let me down like that.

1382
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:49,290
No one's letting you down...

1383
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,887
but we have more pressing problems.

1384
01:31:52,196 --> 01:31:56,467
"The Party's right in any situation,
fighting lies and exploitation!"

1385
01:31:58,002 --> 01:31:59,095
Karl!

1386
01:32:15,086 --> 01:32:18,719
Your party's a bourgeois party,
Mrs. Küsters, that's all.

1387
01:32:19,389 --> 01:32:20,482
Well?

1388
01:32:20,858 --> 01:32:22,451
All parties are.

1389
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,260
But your party's a small party.

1390
01:32:25,863 --> 01:32:29,928
The smaller the party, the less power
it has and the less courage.

1391
01:32:31,901 --> 01:32:34,634
They certainly didn't help with Hermann.

1392
01:32:35,272 --> 01:32:37,002
Because they can't.

1393
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:38,676
It's obvious.

1394
01:32:39,743 --> 01:32:43,547
They stick to the constitution
and try to keep a low profile.

1395
01:32:48,384 --> 01:32:50,182
But they promised me!

1396
01:32:50,386 --> 01:32:54,349
They have to lie, like all the others.
But we don't have to lie.

1397
01:32:54,424 --> 01:32:56,917
We're answerable only to ourselves.

1398
01:32:57,627 --> 01:32:59,061
We are free.

1399
01:32:59,295 --> 01:33:01,528
Maybe. But what can you do?

1400
01:33:01,598 --> 01:33:03,727
There are even fewer of you.

1401
01:33:04,134 --> 01:33:05,534
That's true.

1402
01:33:05,735 --> 01:33:07,728
But we make up for that with spirit.

1403
01:33:08,271 --> 01:33:10,605
We have more guts, Mrs. Küsters.

1404
01:33:10,774 --> 01:33:13,940
I was thinking.
We could just enter the editorial office...

1405
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:16,480
and demand a retraction of the article.

1406
01:33:16,545 --> 01:33:19,346
We'd sit on the floor and stay there...

1407
01:33:21,117 --> 01:33:23,144
until our demands are met.

1408
01:33:24,686 --> 01:33:27,214
You understand? Four or five people...

1409
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:28,349
and you.

1410
01:33:28,423 --> 01:33:29,789
Yes, I see.

1411
01:33:30,526 --> 01:33:34,091
- And you think that would help?
- Of course it would help.

1412
01:33:34,363 --> 01:33:36,856
The whole nation would take notice.

1413
01:33:37,267 --> 01:33:40,831
You want everyone to think about
your husband, don't you?

1414
01:33:41,403 --> 01:33:42,735
Yes, I do.

1415
01:33:43,438 --> 01:33:44,599
But...

1416
01:33:46,441 --> 01:33:48,775
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1417
01:33:49,912 --> 01:33:53,180
It's the only way to achieve
anything in this case.

1418
01:33:53,482 --> 01:33:54,848
Believe me!

1419
01:33:56,051 --> 01:33:57,782
I'll think it over.

1420
01:33:59,655 --> 01:34:02,855
I have to think it over first.
Maybe you're right.

1421
01:34:03,959 --> 01:34:05,359
Another cup?

1422
01:34:06,061 --> 01:34:07,826
Yes, please! Thanks.

1423
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:23,876
I promised my Hermann.

1424
01:34:24,912 --> 01:34:27,213
Into his grave, I promised him.

1425
01:34:27,682 --> 01:34:29,379
Into his grave...

1426
01:34:41,662 --> 01:34:45,260
- We want to see Mr. Niemeyer.
- Yes. What is it about?

1427
01:34:45,334 --> 01:34:47,497
We want to tell him personally.
It's important.

1428
01:34:47,568 --> 01:34:51,029
- Do you know where Niemeyer is?
- No idea. You can see he's not here.

1429
01:34:51,105 --> 01:34:55,239
- Then we'll talk to the editor.
- He's in a meeting.

1430
01:34:55,442 --> 01:34:59,041
Then get him out! It's important!
We have important information.

1431
01:34:59,113 --> 01:35:00,980
Take it easy, young man!

1432
01:35:01,048 --> 01:35:03,018
I'll try, if you insist.

1433
01:35:05,418 --> 01:35:06,751
Dr. Linke?

1434
01:35:06,821 --> 01:35:10,955
There are some people here who say
they have important information.

1435
01:35:11,192 --> 01:35:12,923
No, he's not here.

1436
01:35:12,994 --> 01:35:15,226
Take a seat! He won't be long.

1437
01:35:24,071 --> 01:35:26,974
Well, what is it?
You have some information?

1438
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:29,405
My name's Küsters, Mr...

1439
01:35:29,476 --> 01:35:30,637
Linke.

1440
01:35:35,515 --> 01:35:36,710
Küsters?

1441
01:35:36,783 --> 01:35:38,685
- But that's-
- Exactly.

1442
01:35:38,885 --> 01:35:41,082
She's the wife of your "factory murderer."

1443
01:35:41,154 --> 01:35:42,714
- Mine?
- Sure!

1444
01:35:43,189 --> 01:35:46,184
Your factory murderer.
He's not ours, is he?

1445
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,989
No, he's not our factory murderer.
He's yours.

1446
01:35:50,697 --> 01:35:53,065
And you're responsible
for this defamation.

1447
01:35:53,133 --> 01:35:56,230
To be quite frank,
I can't remember the details.

1448
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:58,672
It was some months ago.

1449
01:35:58,772 --> 01:36:00,799
For me, it's right here.

1450
01:36:01,407 --> 01:36:02,808
Closer than anything.

1451
01:36:02,876 --> 01:36:05,369
And I want you to print
the truth about my husband.

1452
01:36:05,444 --> 01:36:08,177
- That's why we're here.
- My dear woman...

1453
01:36:08,547 --> 01:36:12,715
if we printed a retraction
every time someone complained...

1454
01:36:12,919 --> 01:36:14,615
where would we be?

1455
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:17,324
Write a reader's letter.

1456
01:36:17,957 --> 01:36:20,224
- Maybe we'll print that.
- No!

1457
01:36:21,194 --> 01:36:24,166
I can't wait any longer.
I want something to happen today!

1458
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:27,225
I'm sorry, madam,
but I must ask you to leave.

1459
01:36:27,733 --> 01:36:30,101
You refuse?

1460
01:36:30,436 --> 01:36:32,303
I won't be blackmailed.

1461
01:36:32,571 --> 01:36:35,441
- Then-
- Then maybe this will persuade you!

1462
01:36:39,545 --> 01:36:40,740
But...

1463
01:36:40,946 --> 01:36:44,545
We declare the office occupied.
You are all our hostages.

1464
01:36:44,683 --> 01:36:48,144
Follow our instructions
and nothing will happen to you!

1465
01:36:48,453 --> 01:36:50,082
Against the wall!

1466
01:37:01,599 --> 01:37:04,537
And you! Call the guy
who wrote that article!

1467
01:37:15,314 --> 01:37:16,373
Yes?

1468
01:37:17,348 --> 01:37:18,680
What's up?

1469
01:37:20,551 --> 01:37:22,076
But that's...

1470
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,384
Old Mrs. Küsters?

1471
01:37:27,191 --> 01:37:28,592
Others, too?

1472
01:37:29,794 --> 01:37:31,457
What do they want?

1473
01:37:34,732 --> 01:37:35,893
I see.

1474
01:37:38,002 --> 01:37:39,265
Hostages?

1475
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:43,739
Of course. I'll be right there!

1476
01:37:49,413 --> 01:37:52,010
- What's going on?
- I have to go to the office.

1477
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:54,280
- Where?
- The editorial office.

1478
01:37:55,552 --> 01:37:58,718
Some anarchists are up to something.

1479
01:37:59,824 --> 01:38:01,053
To what?

1480
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:02,924
They've taken hostages.

1481
01:38:02,994 --> 01:38:04,155
Where?

1482
01:38:04,228 --> 01:38:06,630
At the editorial office, darling.

1483
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:09,966
- What's that about my mother?
- Your mother?

1484
01:38:10,234 --> 01:38:12,636
You just said "old Mrs. Küsters."

1485
01:38:12,903 --> 01:38:15,534
Yes, darling. Your mother's with them.

1486
01:38:16,339 --> 01:38:17,534
Mother?

1487
01:38:17,908 --> 01:38:19,605
I don't believe it!

1488
01:38:19,676 --> 01:38:21,236
It's ridiculous!

1489
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,575
Maybe...

1490
01:38:22,779 --> 01:38:24,111
maybe not.

1491
01:38:24,347 --> 01:38:27,808
Anyway, it has to do with my article.
That's why I have to go.

1492
01:38:27,884 --> 01:38:31,415
- Mother with anarchists?
- God! I don't know any details!

1493
01:38:32,222 --> 01:38:34,750
Why are you shouting? What did I do?

1494
01:38:36,993 --> 01:38:38,325
I'm nervous.

1495
01:38:38,394 --> 01:38:39,727
I'm sorry.

1496
01:38:40,097 --> 01:38:42,067
I'll give you a call, okay?

1497
01:38:42,132 --> 01:38:43,191
Bye!

1498
01:38:50,107 --> 01:38:51,974
Mother and anarchists!

1499
01:38:54,845 --> 01:38:56,438
Can you hear me?

1500
01:38:57,047 --> 01:38:58,777
This is the Küsters Commando.

1501
01:38:58,849 --> 01:39:01,285
<i>We have occupied the offices
of the lllustrated.</i>

1502
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:03,115
We're holding three hostages.

1503
01:39:03,186 --> 01:39:06,124
They will be shot
if our demands are not met.

1504
01:39:06,689 --> 01:39:09,320
We demand restitution
for Hermann Küsters.

1505
01:39:09,391 --> 01:39:11,156
He has been wronged.

1506
01:39:11,861 --> 01:39:15,460
This magazine portrayed him
as a brutal murderer and a madman.

1507
01:39:15,531 --> 01:39:16,794
Which he was not.

1508
01:39:16,866 --> 01:39:18,995
He was a lone revolutionary.

1509
01:39:19,401 --> 01:39:21,667
In his honor, we demand the release...

1510
01:39:21,737 --> 01:39:24,800
of all political prisoners in
the Federal Republic of Germany.

1511
01:39:24,874 --> 01:39:26,844
Or people will die here!

1512
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:32,346
Who's that?

1513
01:39:32,848 --> 01:39:35,182
The chief of police? About time!

1514
01:39:35,450 --> 01:39:37,147
We don't want any bloodshed.

1515
01:39:37,219 --> 01:39:41,421
We demand free passage with
our hostages in a Mercedes 600.

1516
01:39:41,857 --> 01:39:44,693
Bring the car here.
The doors must be open.

1517
01:39:44,894 --> 01:39:48,424
Have a Boeing 707 ready,
with a crew of four...

1518
01:39:48,496 --> 01:39:50,659
so we can leave the country.

1519
01:39:50,732 --> 01:39:53,864
We're taking two hostages.
You know our demands.

1520
01:39:54,369 --> 01:39:58,036
The release of all political prisoners
in the name of Hermann Küsters.

1521
01:39:58,107 --> 01:40:00,703
The decision on life or death
is in your hands.

1522
01:40:00,775 --> 01:40:02,768
Long live the revolution!

1523
01:40:08,284 --> 01:40:10,254
About time you got here!

1524
01:40:10,418 --> 01:40:11,784
You're crazy!

1525
01:40:11,853 --> 01:40:14,256
Mrs. Küsters, tell them
to stop their war games!

1526
01:40:14,323 --> 01:40:17,295
Shut your trap, you pig!
Up against the wall!

1527
01:40:25,066 --> 01:40:27,059
They're stark raving mad!

1528
01:40:27,135 --> 01:40:30,734
They're demanding the release
of all political prisoners in Germany.

1529
01:40:30,805 --> 01:40:32,775
They're either amateurs or madmen.

1530
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,103
Shut up!

1531
01:40:39,613 --> 01:40:42,814
The car must be outside
in one hour, as stipulated.

1532
01:40:42,884 --> 01:40:45,218
All hostages but two will be released.

1533
01:40:45,286 --> 01:40:48,486
Linke and Niemeyer
will remain in our hands...

1534
01:40:48,555 --> 01:40:50,582
until our demands are met.

1535
01:40:51,259 --> 01:40:55,359
We want no police
within a radius of 200 meters.

1536
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:59,298
I'm warning you, we can see
everything from up here.

1537
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:01,892
All doors and windows must be shut.

1538
01:41:02,502 --> 01:41:06,636
If our conditions are not met,
the first hostage will be shot.

1539
01:41:07,774 --> 01:41:09,368
Okay. In one hour!

1540
01:41:18,552 --> 01:41:20,248
The escape car has driven up.

1541
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,691
After some time,
Mother Küsters and the others came out

1542
01:41:23,757 --> 01:41:24,952
with the hostages.

1543
01:41:25,092 --> 01:41:27,289
The girl has her weapon

1544
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,695
trained on Niemeyer's head.

1545
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:32,492
Knab is guarding Linke

1546
01:41:32,666 --> 01:41:35,193
Mother Küsters accompanies them

1547
01:41:35,269 --> 01:41:37,239
evidently bewildered.

1548
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:39,167
Ernst sees his mother,

1549
01:41:39,239 --> 01:41:41,334
breaks through the police line,

1550
01:41:41,407 --> 01:41:43,001
and runs toward her.

1551
01:41:43,076 --> 01:41:44,567
Ernst: Mom! Mom!

1552
01:41:45,112 --> 01:41:47,139
Mother Küsters walks

1553
01:41:47,214 --> 01:41:49,684
toward Ernst as if in a trance.

1554
01:41:49,916 --> 01:41:51,851
Horst Knab (close up)

1555
01:41:51,917 --> 01:41:54,320
Knab: Mrs. Küsters, look out!

1556
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:56,146
Mother Küsters (medium close)

1557
01:41:56,223 --> 01:42:00,026
A shot rings through the night.
Mother Küsters falls to the ground.

1558
01:42:00,227 --> 01:42:02,493
Knab shoots Linke dead.

1559
01:42:02,561 --> 01:42:04,724
Then he is hit, too.

1560
01:42:04,930 --> 01:42:07,458
Corinna approaches, kneels down,

1561
01:42:07,533 --> 01:42:10,129
takes her dead mother in her arms

1562
01:42:10,202 --> 01:42:12,765
and lets herself be photographed.

1563
01:42:34,026 --> 01:42:36,622
We want to speak
to your reporter Niemeyer urgently.

1564
01:42:36,695 --> 01:42:40,226
- We have important information.
- I'll see if he's here.

1565
01:42:40,299 --> 01:42:42,394
Don't worry. He'll be here.

1566
01:42:42,667 --> 01:42:44,796
Or maybe he hasn't the guts.

1567
01:42:45,004 --> 01:42:46,632
What do you mean?

1568
01:42:47,106 --> 01:42:48,472
What I say.

1569
01:42:52,211 --> 01:42:53,873
Is Niemeyer there?

1570
01:42:54,012 --> 01:42:56,506
- There are certain persons here...
- Persons?

1571
01:42:56,581 --> 01:42:59,417
Well, some people. I beg your pardon? No?

1572
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:01,614
Oh, well. Too bad!

1573
01:43:02,654 --> 01:43:04,054
Yes. Thanks.

1574
01:43:04,989 --> 01:43:07,790
I'm sorry.
He's in a meeting at the moment.

1575
01:43:07,859 --> 01:43:10,422
Just phone again,
my dear woman, and say...

1576
01:43:10,495 --> 01:43:14,765
that among the persons or people,
or whatever you choose to call us...

1577
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:17,896
that Mother Küsters is one of them.
Understand?

1578
01:43:18,169 --> 01:43:19,570
As you wish.

1579
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:24,506
Sorry to disturb you,
but I should tell you...

1580
01:43:24,609 --> 01:43:27,136
- there's a Mrs. Küsters-
- Mother Küsters.

1581
01:43:27,912 --> 01:43:30,041
Sorry! Mother Küsters.

1582
01:43:30,481 --> 01:43:31,642
Hello!

1583
01:43:33,218 --> 01:43:36,418
Hello, Mrs. Küsters.
Why didn't you say it was you?

1584
01:43:37,322 --> 01:43:41,160
Because I'm not alone, Mr. Niemeyer.
I'm by no means alone.

1585
01:43:41,558 --> 01:43:44,963
We demand the retraction
of your obscene article, Mr. Niemeyer.

1586
01:43:45,029 --> 01:43:48,365
Hermann Küsters was not
a brutal criminal, as you portrayed him.

1587
01:43:48,432 --> 01:43:50,197
Hermann Küsters was...

1588
01:43:50,534 --> 01:43:52,504
a lone revolutionary.

1589
01:43:53,804 --> 01:43:56,241
That's your opinion, my young friend.

1590
01:43:56,307 --> 01:43:57,775
But do you think...

1591
01:43:57,841 --> 01:44:01,372
this will help the memory of
your husband in any way, Mrs. Küsters?

1592
01:44:01,445 --> 01:44:04,440
We're not here to have a discussion.
We're demanding something.

1593
01:44:04,515 --> 01:44:08,580
And we will fight to obtain our demands.
Tell that to your editor!

1594
01:44:23,967 --> 01:44:25,732
That swine Niemeyer!

1595
01:44:25,803 --> 01:44:29,105
In '68, the pig was demonstrating with us.

1596
01:44:31,041 --> 01:44:33,739
- Now they're sitting on the floor?
- Yes.

1597
01:44:34,011 --> 01:44:36,140
It looks quite picturesque.

1598
01:44:36,412 --> 01:44:39,316
And this, this... What did you say he's...

1599
01:44:39,515 --> 01:44:41,178
- Knab.
- Knab, yes.

1600
01:44:41,318 --> 01:44:42,684
Who is he?

1601
01:44:43,586 --> 01:44:45,579
Some washed-up anarchist.

1602
01:44:46,256 --> 01:44:48,988
Too scared to pull something really big.

1603
01:44:49,126 --> 01:44:52,223
Then everything's okay.
I'll take a look at them.

1604
01:45:10,112 --> 01:45:11,341
Corinna!

1605
01:45:11,948 --> 01:45:13,542
Listen, darling!

1606
01:45:14,717 --> 01:45:17,279
Your mother's up to her nonsense again.

1607
01:45:17,352 --> 01:45:20,620
She's staging a sit-down strike
here in the office.

1608
01:45:21,123 --> 01:45:24,323
They want me to retract the article,
or something.

1609
01:45:24,526 --> 01:45:26,827
Yes, with two inane anarchists.

1610
01:45:27,362 --> 01:45:30,027
Be a dear!
Get dressed and come over here!

1611
01:45:30,099 --> 01:45:32,296
You must make her see reason.

1612
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:35,104
It's all so ridiculous.

1613
01:45:36,005 --> 01:45:38,339
No. That's the problem. I can't.

1614
01:45:38,974 --> 01:45:41,309
I have to interview that theater guy...

1615
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,901
who's resigned.

1616
01:45:43,645 --> 01:45:44,670
Okay?

1617
01:45:45,614 --> 01:45:46,912
Thanks.

1618
01:45:49,351 --> 01:45:53,257
Look here, young man,
we're only the local office in Frankfurt.

1619
01:45:53,355 --> 01:45:56,053
The real decisions are made in Hamburg.

1620
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,194
You know that very well.

1621
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:01,022
Then call the police
and have us carried out!

1622
01:46:01,096 --> 01:46:02,827
What? All that bother?

1623
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:04,629
With police and so on?

1624
01:46:04,699 --> 01:46:07,363
No. You'll get up on
your own when you're hungry.

1625
01:46:07,434 --> 01:46:08,960
And there's an end to it!

1626
01:46:09,037 --> 01:46:11,439
The appointment's at 5:00.
See you tomorrow!

1627
01:46:11,505 --> 01:46:14,170
And what should I do? I have to go now.

1628
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:15,802
Just go home!

1629
01:46:15,877 --> 01:46:20,113
- This will sort itself out on its own.
- But if they phone America or something?

1630
01:46:20,181 --> 01:46:22,583
They don't have contacts with America.

1631
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:25,383
Don't worry your head about that.

1632
01:46:39,167 --> 01:46:40,396
See you!

1633
01:47:02,690 --> 01:47:05,685
- Well, what do we do now?
- Wait and see what happens.

1634
01:47:05,759 --> 01:47:08,697
They're sure to take
some action against us.

1635
01:47:16,603 --> 01:47:18,767
It's the wrong method after all.

1636
01:47:18,839 --> 01:47:20,239
- Is it?
- Yes.

1637
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:25,039
The only way to achieve anything
is to use force. Guns, hostages, blackmail.

1638
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,409
Oh, no! No, no!

1639
01:47:28,915 --> 01:47:30,680
That would be wrong.

1640
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:32,344
Quite certainly.

1641
01:47:33,287 --> 01:47:36,726
And everyone would be against us,
and against Hermann as well.

1642
01:47:36,789 --> 01:47:41,288
But we would have achieved something.
Roused people, shaken them.

1643
01:47:42,362 --> 01:47:44,832
But not with violence and threats.

1644
01:47:44,998 --> 01:47:48,061
You see, we do have much less power...

1645
01:47:48,534 --> 01:47:50,766
than the other side, don't we?

1646
01:47:53,773 --> 01:47:54,900
Goodbye!

1647
01:47:54,974 --> 01:47:56,306
Good night!

1648
01:47:59,912 --> 01:48:01,380
Exactly that.

1649
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:05,250
And because we have less power,
but the more humane ideas...

1650
01:48:05,918 --> 01:48:08,856
we may resort to more desperate means.

1651
01:48:10,389 --> 01:48:12,359
I don't understand that.

1652
01:48:13,059 --> 01:48:14,186
No...

1653
01:48:15,094 --> 01:48:17,087
I can't understand that.

1654
01:48:32,278 --> 01:48:33,940
I'm clearing off.

1655
01:48:34,579 --> 01:48:36,606
The whole thing's futile.

1656
01:48:43,722 --> 01:48:45,122
I'm staying.

1657
01:48:47,793 --> 01:48:48,852
Mom!

1658
01:48:49,795 --> 01:48:51,024
Corinna!

1659
01:48:51,797 --> 01:48:53,596
How nice! Sit down!

1660
01:48:54,299 --> 01:48:55,529
Come on!

1661
01:48:56,268 --> 01:48:58,933
Mother, what's all the palaver about?

1662
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:00,600
Palaver?

1663
01:49:00,839 --> 01:49:04,107
I want your friend to take back
his filthy article.

1664
01:49:04,776 --> 01:49:07,508
And I'll stay sitting here until he does.

1665
01:49:08,379 --> 01:49:12,012
No one's interested in whether
you're sitting here or not.

1666
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:14,553
You're just making yourself
look ridiculous.

1667
01:49:14,618 --> 01:49:16,815
Who to? To these people here?

1668
01:49:17,055 --> 01:49:19,651
It's impossible to make myself
look ridiculous to them.

1669
01:49:19,724 --> 01:49:21,353
Not these people.

1670
01:49:23,228 --> 01:49:24,287
Mom!

1671
01:49:26,064 --> 01:49:29,058
Can you even remember
what Dad looked like?

1672
01:49:30,468 --> 01:49:31,993
Why do you ask?

1673
01:49:33,271 --> 01:49:34,762
But it's true.

1674
01:49:35,207 --> 01:49:38,771
Sometimes when I want to recall him,
my head's all empty.

1675
01:49:40,845 --> 01:49:44,147
And yet, I have nothing else
in my head but Hermann.

1676
01:49:45,382 --> 01:49:46,577
Have I?

1677
01:49:47,318 --> 01:49:48,981
I don't know, Mom.

1678
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:51,288
I don't know.

1679
01:49:53,824 --> 01:49:55,258
Come on now!

1680
01:49:56,794 --> 01:49:59,026
No, Corinna. I'm staying here.

1681
01:49:59,864 --> 01:50:01,264
As you wish.

1682
01:50:01,732 --> 01:50:03,827
I'm going again. Ciao, Mom!

1683
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:07,361
- Corinna!
- Yes?

1684
01:50:08,272 --> 01:50:10,869
Are you successful with your singing?

1685
01:50:11,441 --> 01:50:12,910
Yes, Mom. Thanks.

1686
01:50:12,977 --> 01:50:14,206
It's okay.

1687
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,173
Ciao!

1688
01:50:18,249 --> 01:50:19,581
Ciao, Mom!

1689
01:50:40,737 --> 01:50:42,205
Good evening!

1690
01:50:42,772 --> 01:50:44,240
Good evening!

1691
01:50:46,309 --> 01:50:48,542
I heard you were sitting here.

1692
01:50:49,078 --> 01:50:51,105
But I have to lock up now.

1693
01:50:51,413 --> 01:50:53,144
Go ahead and lock up!

1694
01:50:53,216 --> 01:50:56,279
I can't lock up as long
as you're sitting here.

1695
01:50:57,386 --> 01:50:59,253
Then I can't help you.

1696
01:51:00,722 --> 01:51:02,692
Let me take you outside!

1697
01:51:02,992 --> 01:51:05,394
You can come back again tomorrow.

1698
01:51:05,895 --> 01:51:06,863
Tomorrow?

1699
01:51:06,930 --> 01:51:09,765
Yes, tomorrow, and the day after,
and every day.

1700
01:51:09,832 --> 01:51:13,431
But at night, you see,
at night, it's a problem for me...

1701
01:51:13,735 --> 01:51:15,671
because I can't go home then.

1702
01:51:15,737 --> 01:51:18,937
and this evening,
there's "heaven and earth" for dinner...

1703
01:51:19,007 --> 01:51:20,738
with blood sausage.

1704
01:51:21,877 --> 01:51:23,608
"Heaven and earth"?

1705
01:51:23,846 --> 01:51:25,577
Creamed potatoes and apples?

1706
01:51:25,881 --> 01:51:27,851
Yes, with blood sausage.

1707
01:51:28,016 --> 01:51:29,542
With blood sausage.

1708
01:51:29,618 --> 01:51:31,611
There's more than enough.

1709
01:51:32,054 --> 01:51:34,787
Maybe you'd care to join me?
Come along with me!

1710
01:51:34,857 --> 01:51:37,054
But what would your wife say?

1711
01:51:37,358 --> 01:51:39,829
My wife has been dead a long time.

1712
01:51:40,162 --> 01:51:41,688
I live alone...

1713
01:51:42,331 --> 01:51:44,358
I'm alone a lot, you know.

1714
01:51:44,432 --> 01:51:46,231
I'm alone a lot, too.

1715
01:51:47,569 --> 01:51:48,935
There you are!

1716
01:51:49,004 --> 01:51:50,803
Then come along with me!

1717
01:51:50,873 --> 01:51:53,036
And we can consider...

1718
01:51:53,108 --> 01:51:55,135
how to make sure the truth...

1719
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:57,476
is written about your husband.

1720
01:51:58,546 --> 01:52:01,382
How do you know that about my husband?

1721
01:52:01,716 --> 01:52:04,381
I read that article,
and I knew immediately...

1722
01:52:04,452 --> 01:52:06,251
that it was a pack of lies.

1723
01:52:06,321 --> 01:52:07,516
Really?

1724
01:52:08,356 --> 01:52:09,551
My God!

1725
01:52:11,059 --> 01:52:12,425
Come along!

1726
01:52:14,395 --> 01:52:16,194
We're going home...

1727
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:18,423
to eat "heaven and earth"...

1728
01:52:18,499 --> 01:52:21,403
with blood sausage,
and to think out a plan.

1729
01:52:23,704 --> 01:52:25,435
"Heaven and earth!"
