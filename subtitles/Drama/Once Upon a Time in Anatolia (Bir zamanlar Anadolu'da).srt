1
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,379
ONCE UPON A TIME IN ANATOLIA

2
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,411
Izzet, bring him over.

3
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,089
Is it here?

4
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,889
Huh?

5
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,058
- No.
- What?

6
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,296
- It's not here.
- You sure?

7
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,616
How do you know it's not here?

8
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,170
- The place wasn't like this.
- What?

9
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,331
The place wasn't like this.
There was a field.

10
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,139
What sort of field?
On a slope or flat?

11
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,532
Flat. There was like a round tree.

12
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,452
A round tree?

13
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,337
Chief, does he mean
the fountain down beside Kizilkaya?

14
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,172
Oh, the one by whatsits name..

15
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,014
- There's a field there?
- Sure.

16
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,179
- So you're saying it's not here.
- No.

17
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,809
OK. Take him away, Izzet.

18
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,330
Mr Prosecutor, seems there's
another fountain like this down below.

19
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,298
He says it's not here,
so I'd guess it's there.

20
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,894
- So it's not here either.
- No. That's what he says.

21
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,537
Fine. Let's go then.

22
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,252
- We call it 'komus' where I come from.
- Whatever. So one night...

23
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,570
It's late. Everyone's tanked up.

24
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,254
- You listening, doctor?
- Of course, chief.

25
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,928
So we're all drunk
and the tax officer walks off.

26
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,933
I think, he's an ass-licker.
He'll come back with something.

27
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,170
Soon as he sees a big wig,
he gets to work.

28
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,058
- That's Nedim.
- Who?

29
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,893
- The tax officer at the time.
- No, it was Sinasi.

30
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,413
Nedim came before him.

31
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,176
Oh, yes. He'd throw back
his head to talk. Fat and bald.

32
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,458
Around two months
after Mr. Galip arrived...

33
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,770
...he got posted somewhere else.

34
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,649
Well, he goes off with the waiters.

35
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,892
And they come back with three trays.

36
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,934
- See a tray and what do you think?
- Kebabs.

37
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,613
You'd think kebabs. Meat.

38
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,458
But no! It's yoghurt.
What kind of yoghurt?

39
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,368
Not the soupy kind we know.
It's hard as rock.

40
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,295
- You need a knife to cut the stuff.
- Sure it wasn't cheese, chief?

41
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,575
Cheese?

42
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,970
You think I don't know yoghurt
from cheese, doctor?

43
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,778
What do you take me for?

44
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,170
That stuff’s delicious, doctor.
Especially in spring.

45
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,731
No, it was yoghurt.
But buffalo yoghurt.

46
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,936
Not sheep or whatever,
buffalo yoghurt.

47
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,490
They have buffalo stuff at the dairy
down from our quarters.

48
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,970
- Where is there a dairy?
- Down from our quarters, sir.

49
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,779
Which quarters are you in?
What dairy?

50
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,250
You know that dairy
below our quarters?

51
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,853
- By Kivircik's place?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,772
They sometimes make it there.

53
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,012
- That stuff’s pasteurized!
- No, it's buffalo. I've tried it.

54
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,091
- It kind of smelled.
- It smells if it's good.

55
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,812
Buffalo yoghurt.. Wouldn't I know
if they had it at the corner shop?

56
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,499
- I'm crazy about the stuff.
- To be honest, chief, you don't know.

57
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,493
I tried it.
But it just seemed to smell a bit.

58
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,450
Because it's good. The animals eat
fresh grass in spring, right, doctor?

59
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,577
Arab, some people have no taste
for the good things.

60
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,857
I mention buffalo yoghurt
and the guy says it smells.

61
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,932
He doesn't know the real thing.
What's he used to?

62
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,534
Pasteurized. You can get
pasteurized from any shop.

63
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,134
No, chief. My deceased mother
used to make it.

64
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,733
They can't make it like that now.

65
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,336
You know, I see stuff sometimes
that really bugs me.

66
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,572
In the supermarket. 'Skimmed' yoghurt.
What the hell is that?

67
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,413
'Skimmed' yoghurt.
You'd be ashamed to write the words.

68
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,014
There's a good dollop
of cream in buffalo yoghurt.

69
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,978
Nedim was in Mr. Galip's time.
That's the guy.

70
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,051
- He was a good man.
- And nice.

71
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,690
Nice, meaning harmless.
Harmless passes for nice these days.

72
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,499
Useful doesn't come into it, Arab.

73
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,458
OK, where is it then?

74
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,729
Well..

75
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,894
Huh?

76
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,132
Well, umm...

77
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,773
Kenan!

78
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,650
- Speak to me! Where is it?
- I don't know.

79
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,818
- I mean, I'd been drinking.
- What?

80
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,255
- I'd been drinking.
- Huh?

81
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,216
You'd been drinking.

82
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,772
- You'd been drinking?
- Yes.

83
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,216
- Had your brother been drinking too?
- He doesn't drink.

84
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,449
So you don't remember exactly?

85
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,051
Say something.
Say there was a tree, anything!

86
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,496
Was it up by the fountain
or below the road? Say something!

87
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,655
Ramazan.

88
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,499
Come over here, lad.

89
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,375
Can you show me, lad?
Where it was then?

90
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,890
Huh? Where was it?

91
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,488
Ramazan, don't be scared now.
Just say where it was.

92
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,615
I don't know.

93
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,372
You don't know?

94
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,897
You don't know
or you don't remember?

95
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,575
- I was asleep.
- What do you mean?

96
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,568
Answer me, lad!

97
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,248
- I was asleep.
- Huh?

98
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,773
I was asleep.

99
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,012
You were asleep.

100
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,738
Kenan.

101
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,650
Just get your head together
and let's be done with this, huh?

102
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,052
Is this the place?

103
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,175
- I think so.
- You think so?

104
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,849
Over by that fountain, if we...

105
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,417
- Over here?
- Yes.

106
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,613
Your tree.. The trees are down below.
Or was the tree by the fountain?

107
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,692
It's dark now.
I need to look.

108
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,138
Sergeant, point those headlights
this way.

109
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,336
Mehmet, turn the car round
to face the fountain.

110
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,456
Izzet, bring him over.

111
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,018
Is this the place?

112
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,691
Well...

113
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,449
Yes?

114
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,250
It looks like here, but those trees...

115
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,011
- Which trees?
- On a diagonal with those trees...

116
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,735
- Yes?
- There was a dug-up field.

117
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,570
- You mean ploughed?
- Yes.

118
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,333
Come here. Look, this is ploughed.
You mean here?

119
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,459
Huh?

120
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,336
Diggers! Over here!

121
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,328
Check for any newly dug holes.

122
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,099
Quick!

123
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,731
Where exactly in the field?

124
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,699
Right by the entrance, or what?

125
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,528
- Huh?
- There was a round tree.

126
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,173
What kind of tree?

127
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,338
I say that
because it was easy to dig.

128
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,413
You say there was a round tree.
What do you mean?

129
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,571
Did you dig under the tree?

130
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,333
Kenan, now look here.

131
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,860
Are you trying to distract me?

132
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,330
It won't get you anywhere.

133
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,936
Whatever we talked about
at the police station, that's it.

134
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,253
You come out here
and you lose your head.

135
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,099
I'm treating you decently.
So be a man and show me the place.

136
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,894
Huh?

137
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,612
Where is it?

138
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,374
Is it here?
Hey, is it here?

139
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,775
Mr Prosecutor, he says
this isn't the place either.

140
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,738
Naci. Didn't you say to me
everything was all set?

141
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,009
Yes, Mr Prosecutor, but... They'd been
drinking that night. And the darkness...

142
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,173
I have to be in Ankara in the morning.
You know that. I told you.

143
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,969
I know, but everywhere looks
kind of the same to be honest.

144
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,010
Look, we all came out here
counting on you.

145
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,939
Arab, the guys got left behind.
Can't you see? Give them a shout.

146
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,138
Hey, Hayrettin!

147
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,891
Shape up! Move it!

148
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,090
Quick! Move it!

149
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,008
It's easy to just sit there
and talk.

150
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,656
Right, Arab?

151
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,048
What's that, boss?

152
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,496
I'm saying it's easy
to sit there and spout.

153
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,650
Look, did I give you any guarantees?

154
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,335
Did I? Am I an insurance company?

155
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,416
I take the suspects' statements.
The guys confess.

156
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,334
They say they'll show us the place.
So I say let's wrap up the case.

157
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,172
What else can I say?

158
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,533
The place has to be Girmacakil, boss.
Can't be anywhere else.

159
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,776
Because he's talking about
an old bridge.

160
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,728
Easier said than done, of course.
You attend the questioning then!

161
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,139
First you dump the job on me,
then you give me a hard time about it!

162
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,736
Give me a break, Arab! How many times
have I told you I gave up?

163
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,132
You're stressed out, right, boss?
Just thought you'd loosen up a bit.

164
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,254
Ah, hello? Hello.

165
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,053
It's dragging on, you know.
That's why I haven't called.

166
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,530
You should go to bed.
Tonight's going to be a bit..

167
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,658
I'm saying go to bed. Go to bed.
Sweetie, this. It won't end soon.

168
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,260
Where am I? On the road. In the car
with Arab Ali. We're out looking.

169
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,689
We're heading towards Girmacakil.

170
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,739
Not Diyarbakir, Girmacakil.

171
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,739
Hello?

172
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,890
How am I supposed to call?
Look, there's no signal.

173
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,778
Oh, that.
I was going to yesterday but..

174
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,377
OK, the doctor's here with me now.
I'll take care of it.

175
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,656
I didn't forget.

176
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,257
I didn't forget, dearest. Would I?
What way is that to talk?

177
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,294
OK, first thing tomorrow I'll..

178
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,977
OK, I'll take care of it.

179
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,780
I didn't forget
for goodness sake. OK.

180
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,013
How's the boy?
Hello?

181
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,452
Hey, doctor.
My boy's out of pills. I..

182
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,696
I meant to stop by yesterday
for a prescription, but forgot again.

183
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,574
The wife keeps asking, of course.

184
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,933
- Can we sort it out in the morning?
- Sure, no problem.

185
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,415
Thanks. Let me get the thing
or it won't be...

186
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,891
What's going on now?
Why's he stopped?

187
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,535
What's up?

188
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,137
I always get lost on this road.
Why don't you go first, chief?

189
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,291
You know none of the roads and still
you get to drive for the courthouse!

190
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,130
What's holding them up?

191
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,731
How many times is that now?
Three or four?

192
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,773
I've been counting, sir.
It's five including this time.

193
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,529
Doctor, that's prostate, right?
The prosecutor's thing?

194
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,331
It depends. Maybe, maybe not.

195
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,569
Five times and it still depends?

196
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,572
Well, without an examination..

197
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,211
I get up once a night.
Twice if I've drunk a lot of water.

198
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,372
That's normal, isn't it?

199
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,010
Right, once a night is fine.
Quite normal.

200
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,056
But after a certain age
it's worth getting checked.

201
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,850
You're coming in the morning, right?
I can examine you then.

202
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,409
No, God forbid!

203
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,176
- Why?
- I know how it's done.

204
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,899
Oh, right.

205
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,217
There's nothing wrong with me.

206
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,533
But check the prosecutor, I'd say.

207
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,933
He's coming.

208
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,331
Is it above the road or below?
Let's hear that first.

209
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,448
Huh?

210
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,898
You came this way.

211
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,133
- Down there..
- You're saying it's down there?

212
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,857
What about the tree?
Where's the round tree?

213
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,053
The tree there, you can see the top.
Can we look there?

214
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,369
- That tree down there?
- Yes.

215
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,452
Headlights, sergeant!
Headlights down below!

216
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,134
Mehmet, point the lights down below.

217
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,894
- Diggers, over here!
- Mr. Naci!

218
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,537
- Shall we bring Suspect Two this time?
- No, not necessary.

219
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,851
- What's your name?
- Hayrettin, chief.

220
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,214
- Fahrettin?
- Hayrettin, chief.

221
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,452
Why did you both bring shovels?
Huh? Fahrettin?

222
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,490
Hayrettin, chief.

223
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,379
I'm asking you something
and you correct me, son of a bitch.

224
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,215
If you can't dig up the ground here,
I'll use you as a pickaxe.

225
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,848
Got that, Fahrettin?

226
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,177
Captain, switch to full-beam!
Is that full-beam?

227
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,173
- Come down a bit.
- Is that full-beam?

228
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,811
Switch to full-beam!
Point them at the trees!

229
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,891
What's going on?
Where are they?

230
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,416
- Down there, looking around.
- Is this the place?

231
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,213
No idea, doctor.

232
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,299
First the guy talks about fields,
now he says it's the hillside.

233
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,609
I don't get it.

234
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,533
Hey, Arab.

235
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,648
There's a bunch of sculptures
over there.

236
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,493
Sculptures?

237
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,170
Oh right, yes.
There's a lot around here.

238
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,098
They're paying you overtime,
right, doctor?

239
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,137
I don't know. I expect so.

240
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,730
They will.

241
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,297
They should.

242
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,174
The money's good
when it's a corpse.

243
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,852
Look at Tevfik.
He never misses a chance.

244
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,855
All that overtime and suddenly
there's a second storey on his house.

245
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,094
It's raining like crazy
over in Igdebeli, doctor.

246
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,854
It'll be here before you know it.

247
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,456
I come here a lot, doctor.

248
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,499
You see, I love it here.
I jump in the car.

249
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,971
I fill up my pockets with bullets,
40 or 50, come here and fire away.

250
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,417
If there's no game around,
then straight into the air.

251
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,493
How can I say?

252
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,613
It's a way of letting off steam.

253
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,298
So you have a gun, huh?

254
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,374
Who doesn't round here, doctor?

255
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,295
You can't do without a gun.

256
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,737
There's good people and bad.
You can never tell.

257
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,016
If it comes to it,
you have to be ruthless.

258
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,734
And shoot them
right between the eyes.

259
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,335
That's how it is
around here, doctor.

260
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,534
You're kind of forced to
take matters into your own hands.

261
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:12,138
If you can't manage yourself,
they'll handle it just like that.

262
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,420
You won't know how it happened.

263
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,416
That's how it is. Behind the wheel,
by the window, and for free as well.

264
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,133
They won't fall for it.

265
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,496
They won't be fooled.

266
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,053
They're tricky crooks. What's worse,
they make out you owe them.

267
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,012
I know, I'm telling you.

268
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,612
You have to stay in the circle,
and keep an eye on the center.

269
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,217
How about the hoop?
Would that do? Sure, that's OK too.

270
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,453
But in the right place
at the right time.

271
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:56,457
The thing is.. If it comes to it,
you also have to be able to give up.

272
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,331
We none of us live forever,
do we, doctor?

273
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,214
The Prophet Solomon.
He lived to 750.

274
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,612
Gold, jewels..
Well, he died in the end too.

275
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,891
Right, doctor?

276
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,933
It's raining on Igdebeli.

277
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,931
Let it.

278
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:51,054
It's been raining for centuries.
What difference does it make?

279
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,531
But not even 100 years from now, Arab...

280
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,658
...neither you, me,
the prosecutor or the police chief..

281
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,615
Well, as the poet said...

282
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,015
Still the years will pass..

283
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,457
And not a trace will remain of me..

284
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:26,296
Darkness and cold
will enfold my weary soul..

285
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,536
Isn't that so, Arab?

286
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,777
Hey, steady on, doctor!

287
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,172
We're not done yet! And you've
buried us before we're even dead.

288
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,057
You shouldn't think like that.

289
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,450
I don't know. It's dragging on.

290
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,453
- It's the boredom getting to me.
- No.

291
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,017
Don't, you know..
Maybe you're bored to death now.

292
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,699
But one day, you may get a kick
out of the stuff going on here.

293
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,295
When you have a family...

294
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,773
...you'll have a story to tell.
Is that so bad?

295
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,253
You can say,
"Once upon a time in Anatolia..."

296
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,935
"... when I was working
out in the sticks..."

297
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,773
"... I remember this one night
which began like this."

298
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,131
You can tell it like a fairytale.

299
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,375
- Isn't that right, doctor?
- Yes. Sure.

300
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,454
C'mon, Arab!
Get ready to move on.

301
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,018
OK, Mr Prosecutor.
We're all sorted.

302
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,048
The place is definite now.
Not here, but at the next bend.

303
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,535
Soon as we get there...

304
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,051
We're done, guys.
Everyone in the cars. At the double!

305
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,570
- Lead the way, Mr Prosecutor.
- Let's go.

306
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,618
- Get in! Leg out of the way!
- C'mon, Arab!

307
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,775
Sergeant, I'll give you a shout
if we need Suspect Two. OK?

308
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,259
Right, OK.

309
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,251
Back out! Out!

310
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,011
I do a cross-examination
and look what the guy says!

311
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,169
"Shall I bring you Suspect Two?"
He's carving a role for himself there.

312
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,258
- Arab, are you in love or something?
- No, boss. But..

313
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,737
The car won't move.
It won't move.

314
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,731
Shall I tell you something?
Look, that junior officer...

315
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,454
Arab, put your foot down.

316
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,415
- Arab, you're sticking it in third!
- What shall we do? Push?

317
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,214
C'mon, out.

318
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,331
Shall we push, Mr. Naci?

319
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,775
- Leave it to us.
- Izzet. Don't stand there. Push!

320
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,931
- Chief, he's in third gear.
- Bravo!

321
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,658
- You start in second, idiot!
- I'm here.

322
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,572
Captain.. Over here.

323
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,895
God! C'mon, speed up!

324
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,213
Hold it!

325
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,932
- OK, move!
- Hey, boss..

326
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,732
You never get good LPG on the way out
of Kirikkale. Never! I have my place.

327
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,580
I don't want to say this,
you know, but..

328
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,052
It's always Tevfik. Rely on him
for anything and sure enough..

329
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,688
What model's this car?

330
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,529
Arab, we're on the right road,
right?

331
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:52,053
Inshallah, boss. As the song goes,
we're riding on a sign bound for hell.

332
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,779
We do whatever sir in the back says.
And he asks me what's going on.

333
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,809
For God's sake. How do I know?

334
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,895
But well, if the old bridge
can't be anywhere except Girmacakil.

335
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,890
Huh?

336
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,574
- Actually, on the way to the dam...
- Look, don't give me dams now!

337
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,652
- The dam's miles away!
- There's an old bridge there too.

338
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,539
But obviously, boss,
that's in the wrong direction.

339
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,374
Hey! Did you see
anything like a dam?

340
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,858
Is he asleep? Wake him up!

341
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,013
- Wake up, you!
- Didn't I tell you to keep him awake?

342
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,891
- I didn't realize.
- You never goddamn listen!

343
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,088
Was there a dam?
You see anything like it on the way?

344
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,578
- Was there a dam?
- No.

345
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,335
- You sure?
- Yes.

346
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,134
Yes?

347
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,936
- It could be across there.
- What?

348
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,175
Across there.

349
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,456
- You mean the slope across there.
- Yes.

350
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,531
OK. Sergeant!

351
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,452
Turn the car around.

352
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,693
And beam the lights
straight at that facing slope.

353
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,328
Mehmet, over here. Follow me.

354
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,698
Yes. Beam those lights.
Turn around.

355
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,171
OK, that's good.

356
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,254
Watch out for the water.
Go ahead.

357
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,249
God! Diggers, where are you?

358
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,653
Don't wait for an invitation
every time. Run automatically!

359
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,818
That's my socks gone, Izzet.

360
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,732
What do you say, Mr Prosecutor?
Looks like we finally cracked it, huh?

361
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,056
Don't be so sure, doctor.

362
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,576
Well, Naci seems
pretty confident this time.

363
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,576
Ignore Naci.

364
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,138
He's just a handful of bees,
as my mother would say.

365
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,056
All noise and no action.

366
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,893
Was it Fahrettin, your name?
What?

367
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,248
You don't have kids,
do you, doctor?

368
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,179
No.

369
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,099
- I'm not even married, Mr Prosecutor.
- I know that but..

370
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:14,290
Actually, I was married,
but I divorced two years ago.

371
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,978
Good thing then.

372
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,654
- What?
- I said good thing then.

373
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,617
I mean, there being no kids.

374
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,977
- Divorce isn't easy if there's kids.
- Right.

375
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,615
I didn't want kids.

376
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,778
Basically, doctor,
you've done the best thing.

377
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,775
Look at the times we live in.

378
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,372
Here you go.
And this is nothing.

379
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,816
How many more examples, only worse!

380
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,017
With some of the deaths
I come across in this job...

381
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,812
...you need to be less a prosecutor
than an astrologer to find the cause.

382
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,658
Whichever way you look,
you just can't make sense of it.

383
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,170
There was a woman, for example.

384
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,528
The wife of a friend.

385
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:24,813
One day, the woman said she'd die
on a specific date five months later.

386
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,218
And sure enough,
when that day came around...

387
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,976
...the woman dropped dead.

388
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,939
- What do you mean?
- Exactly what I said.

389
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,133
She said she'd have her baby
and die five months later.

390
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,177
And a few days after giving birth...

391
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,138
...she dropped dead...

392
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,738
...for no reason at all.

393
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,256
- So the woman was pregnant?
- Yes.

394
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,495
And she was a smart, educated woman,
not in the least superstitious.

395
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,052
Oh, and she was just gorgeous too.

396
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,579
Mr Prosecutor..

397
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:45,089
- Would you like some cream biscuits?
- Yes, sergeant. I'm starving. Thanks.

398
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,611
- Dr Cemal?
- No, thanks.

399
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,090
I see you've come prepared, sergeant.

400
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,291
That's what marks out a soldier.

401
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,373
Luckily I had some spare fuel
put in the back too. Two cans, sir.

402
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,299
Good thinking.

403
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,651
Because at this rate...

404
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,211
who knows how far we'll be going.

405
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,450
Right now we're 34 km
from the town centre, sir.

406
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,450
Really?

407
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,612
- We've come that far?
- I'd even say 35 km.

408
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,336
We've been outside
the municipal limits for a while.

409
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,172
Right.

410
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,139
This business is dragging on.

411
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,895
Will there be a problem
with the report, sir?

412
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,617
What?

413
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,897
Will Naci get us to sign
the report, or sign himself?

414
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,699
- We don't want a problem there.
- With the investigation report?

415
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,897
Yes. Beyond the municipal limits
is gendarmerie territory.

416
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,575
- We don't want a problem there.
- No, sergeant.

417
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,413
- The crime took place in town.
- Yes.

418
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,855
If it hadn't, you'd be right.
That's not the case.

419
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,057
For that reason, Mr. Naci is still
in charge. There isn't a problem.

420
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,532
OK. Obviously we take orders from you.

421
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,375
Can I have another one?

422
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,136
- Dr Cemal, like one?
- No, thanks.

423
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,012
The butcher thinks about meat,
the lamb about the knife.

424
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,093
The man's only worry
is the municipal boundaries.

425
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,652
Look at him! He's even bothered
to count the kilometers.

426
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,298
So what was the cause
of that woman's death?

427
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,369
The gorgeous woman
you were talking about.

428
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,579
What was her cause of death?
What did the doctors say?

429
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,568
You little fucker! Son of a bitch!

430
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,254
You fucking dickhead!
Are you taking the piss?

431
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,854
- Am I your plaything?
- Mr. Naci! What's going on?

432
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,375
- Chief!
- Get away! Asshole!

433
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,611
- Naci!
- Fuck you!

434
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,730
Naci!

435
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,859
You understand this language, right?
Dickhead!

436
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,375
Come here!
Show me that round tree!

437
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,578
Show me a round tree,
or your whole family's fucked!

438
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,857
Naci! What the hell is going on?

439
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,090
- Here! Show the prosecutor that tree...
- Hold it! Just calm down!

440
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,093
Here, Mr Prosecutor. Out of my way!

441
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,054
He's going to show us
a round tree.

442
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,769
Get off him, OK?
Izzet! Take him away.

443
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,736
- What is this, acting like a kid?
- This business ends tonight, asshole!

444
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,095
Now look here, Naci!

445
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,891
Just calm down!

446
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,895
What's this ruckus about?
You can't go about things like this!

447
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,617
For God's sake. Now look here,
just come with me.

448
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,615
- This business ends tonight, fucking...
- Naci!

449
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,933
What is this? No rough stuff!

450
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,650
- You'll have us both in trouble.
- It's the language he understands.

451
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,573
No, out of the question!

452
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,733
You'll have us both in trouble.
If he was left to you, then what?

453
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,052
But Mr Prosecutor, the guy said
during questioning...

454
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,849
...that we'd come out here,
he'd show us, and we'd be done.

455
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,057
- I don't want to disappoint you.
- You questioned him.

456
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,570
I dropped everything in Ankara
and came back for your sake.

457
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,499
We've been wandering about for hours.
My patience is running out.

458
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:29,175
My whole thing is to get you
to Ankara as fast as possible.

459
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,896
- That's gone pear-shaped too.
- He only understands that language!

460
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,219
- Shameless git!
- First, just calm down, OK?

461
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,498
Just calm down.
We have a bit more time.

462
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,375
Let's finish the job and I'll be off.
We won't get anywhere like this.

463
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,408
It's my responsibility
that you're out here. I...

464
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,138
You know
the new code of procedures?

465
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,689
It's the new code that made this mess.

466
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,373
Look, Naci. I like you..

467
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,134
I wouldn't want to lead
an inquiry into your conduct.

468
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,531
Is this how we'll get into
the European Union? No way!

469
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,288
- Even in the EU, dickheads like...
- I know everyone's tired.

470
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,294
Give me another half-hour
and if I don't nail the asshole...

471
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,975
Naci! Everyone's tired, I know.

472
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,729
But you should have cleared this up
during questioning.

473
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,370
Now is not the time.
We've been on the road for hours.

474
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,693
What do we do now? Give up?

475
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,218
No, Mr Prosecutor. Why give up?
I'll get this done tonight.

476
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,898
Another half-hour with him and I'll..
Don't get me wrong, I won't..

477
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,372
You know what we'll do then?

478
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,174
The team's tired as it is.
We'll grab something to eat.

479
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:47,617
We'll have a break and calm down.
OK? And carry on after that.

480
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,811
OK, guys. There's no problem.

481
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,175
Izzet, wipe his mouth.

482
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,609
Let's not get demoralized.

483
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,132
We'll have a break now.
Then carry on.

484
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,699
- Tevfik!
- Yes, Mr Prosecutor?

485
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,328
Remember you said
there was a village near here?

486
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,775
- You mean Ceceli, sir?
- At the mayor's place.

487
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,500
- Ceceli, sir. Arab's wife's village.
- Really?

488
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,979
- Ceceli.
- We're going to Ceceli then.

489
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,970
- Mr Prosecutor?
- Yes?

490
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,416
There's Koshger. It's closer,
cleaner, more, you know..

491
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,889
We should go there.

492
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,015
But Koshger's at least 7-8 km away.
Ceceli's only 5-6 km.

493
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,331
Mr Prosecutor,
the Ceceli road's a bit risky.

494
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,209
- What's risky about it?
- Floods have wrecked the road.

495
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,129
- I tried going last week in a tractor.
- I went with the agriculturists.

496
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,860
It was no problem.
The road was fine.

497
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,898
- Did you go the Harmanli way?
- Yes.

498
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,290
They must have fixed that bit.

499
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,499
- I'm talking about whatsit..
- Masat.

500
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,299
- Yes.
- Well, where are we going? To Ceceli.

501
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,054
Does it matter which way we go?
Aren't we going to Ceceli?

502
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,297
You mentioned Harmanli!
Otherwise, go whatever way.

503
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,018
The outcome?

504
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,492
In that case, let's...

505
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,213
We're going to Ceceli.

506
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,734
- Tevfik?
- Yes, Mr Prosecutor?

507
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,892
Call the mayor.
Tell him the prosecutor's coming.

508
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:25,811
- Have him make tea and whatever.
- Right away, Mr Prosecutor!

509
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,172
Bring him over.

510
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,251
Let me have a look.

511
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,178
Got a cigarette?

512
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,059
Did you say something?

513
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,735
Can I have a cigarette
if you've got one?

514
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,375
Sure.

515
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,770
Arab, give me a cigarette, will you?

516
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,813
- What's up, doctor?
- You light it.

517
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,811
- Thanks.
- Hang on, doctor! Don't give it to him.

518
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,932
What do you want
with that cigarette? Huh?

519
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,855
What do you want
with that cigarette?

520
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,610
I'm talking to you!
What do you want with it?

521
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,170
He wants a smoke. What else?

522
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,219
No, wait. You tell me, you!
What do you want with that cigarette?

523
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,579
Look, if you want a cigarette,
first you have to earn it.

524
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,414
Nothing comes for free anymore.

525
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,579
Look at the prosecutor.

526
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,573
The guy studied law, he's worked.

527
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,091
He can smoke
and he can give people hell.

528
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,058
Why? Because he's earned it.

529
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,539
What have you done?
Made idiots of us.

530
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,698
No, none of that.

531
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,056
No more free cigarettes.

532
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,054
We're tuned to another channel now.

533
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,138
Doctor, you don't know these guys.

534
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,213
They're such bastards
they'd rob you blind, the assholes.

535
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:16,177
He's seen you're a pigeon.
He's plotting now as we speak.

536
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,498
It's over.

537
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,979
From now on, I'm talking
a different language to you.

538
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,412
Thanks.

539
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,851
Are they here? Esat!

540
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,888
Haci, come here.

541
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,536
Open the gates, quick!

542
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,611
Mukhtar my friend, the prosecutor.

543
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,377
- Hello, mukhtar.
- Welcome. Thanks for coming.

544
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,737
- How are you, mukhtar?
- Welcome, chief. Welcome.

545
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,453
Doctor, welcome.

546
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,857
Welcome, sergeant. Bless you.
Come on in!

547
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,092
It's so good of you to come.
Bless you. Really.

548
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,576
- Are the dogs tied up?
- They won't bite or anything.

549
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,093
Esat, hold him.

550
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,490
Come on.
He won't do anything.

551
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,692
- This way. Are you tired?
- Very.

552
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,454
- What's up at this time of night?
- An investigation.

553
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,258
- Really?
- Into an incident.

554
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,654
- Sorry, our visit is hardly timely.
- Not at all! It's an honour!

555
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:19,219
Yalcin, don't hang around there!
In you go now!

556
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,219
Mr. Naci, doctor, in you go.

557
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:25,931
For heaven's sake, c'mon, sergeant.
In you go.

558
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:32,775
So, it takes a death to get you
to our village, Mr Prosecutor?

559
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,654
True, the doctor came the other day
to vaccinate the babies, bless him.

560
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,731
But his thing's different.

561
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,929
Well, we'd come, mukhtar,
but we had to twist Arab's arm.

562
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,369
Why?

563
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,977
How do I know? He went on about
all the donkey people in the village.

564
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:54,453
- Whatever that means.
- You believe that nutcase, chief?

565
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:59,012
Ignore the nutcase. He never
stops talking, to himself as well.

566
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,894
If we start on him,
I could talk for hours.

567
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,779
His grandfather's nickname
was Cafer the Donkey Man.

568
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,329
- Really?
- Of course.

569
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,777
- Cafer what?
- Cafer the Donkey Man.

570
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,174
Arab, is that true?

571
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:17,294
Boss, my grandfather traded donkeys.
What else would his nickname be?

572
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,411
The guys here are another kind
of donkey men.

573
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,209
Ignore what he says, chief.
Arab's a decent fellow actually.

574
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:29,093
One of the family. We like him.
We gave him a bride from the village.

575
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,577
- Really?
- Yes. He's family.

576
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,694
What way is that to talk about
people from your wife's village?

577
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:40,377
- For some reason, Arab doesn't like us.
- Your wife's village? Shame on you!

578
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:44,414
What's likeable about the gossip hole?
You think I'd throw my arms round it?

579
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,934
- There's no smoke without fire.
- Just eat up, Tevfik, you ass-kisser.

580
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,778
Got any cola?

581
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,892
The lad wants cola.
There isn't any. Is Ayran OK?

582
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,057
Cola? Give him water.

583
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,735
- Arab!
- Right, OK.

584
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:09,693
Mr Prosecutor, we still haven't
sorted out that cemetery business.

585
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,257
- Sorry, I'm going to bore you now.
- Not at all.

586
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,056
Can you talk to the district governor?
He'll listen to you.

587
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:20,690
Sure, I'll talk to the governor,
but what's the business about?

588
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,452
It's nothing really.

589
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:26,376
We want to fix the cemetery wall
but just can't get the funding.

590
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:27,570
Well?

591
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:33,337
The wall's in ruins, so animals go
and shit there, pardon my language.

592
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:37,052
It's misery for the dead
and a nuisance for the villagers.

593
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:41,054
The main thing is to knock down
the outbuildings by the entrance...

594
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,771
...and build a nice morgue there.
It's been okayed by the village elders.

595
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:49,171
- Build what?
- A morgue. And a body-washing room.

596
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,649
A morgue with a body-washing room.

597
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,490
The project's ready,
the paperwork's all done...

598
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,899
...but we can't get started
without the contract or funding.

599
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,459
Mr. Naci, it's essential, believe me.

600
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:10,139
If we manage to pull it off, the
village will have a great masterpiece.

601
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,575
I swear to God, we don't know
what to do with the dead in summer.

602
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,252
- Why?
- They smell.

603
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,617
- Try burying them.
- Why wait? Bury them.

604
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:26,178
We would, but the village
has suffered from emigration.

605
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,094
- Emigration?
- There's only old folk left.

606
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,099
Now when brides and daughters
start phoning from Istanbul..

607
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:36,219
We have a lot of relatives in Germany.
They want to come and see the body.

608
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:40,539
You get them on the phone saying,
"Don't bury dad, I have to kiss him."

609
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,051
Fine, but the man smells.
Where are you going to kiss him?

610
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,132
What can you say? You have to wait.

611
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:53,896
They haven't been back in 10 years,
but the parents are here.

612
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,852
Only old people are left.

613
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,808
It takes someone to die
before they think of the village.

614
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:04,095
When I say this, the gossip starts.
That's my real problem.

615
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,729
What do they say?

616
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,337
That I'll squander village money
on a morgue. As if there's any money!

617
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,172
It's only gossip of course,
God forbid.

618
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,973
My sons are doing all right,
thank the Lord.

619
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,298
I've raised them.
They've flown the nest.

620
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,578
The oldest is in the defense industry
in Kirikkale. He's doing fine.

621
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:31,092
I have two grandchildren there.
The second's a policeman in Canakkale.

622
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,495
- Great.
- In Yenice.

623
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,854
A colleague for you, Izzet.

624
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,329
Next down is a girl.
We married her to a sergeant.

625
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,492
So we're doing all right.
The kids are all right.

626
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,373
But the villagers are dirt poor.
They aren't well off.

627
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,737
- How many terms have you done?
- This year, God willing...

628
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,211
- ... I'll be standing for a third term.
- Look at that!

629
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,055
I had absolutely no intention
of standing this time, believe me.

630
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:04,368
But the neighbours insisted.

631
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,209
You have a son?

632
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,371
- What, at home?
- You have a son?

633
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,771
- I told you, I have two. The first...
- Yes, in the defense industry.

634
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,693
There's no one left at home.

635
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:18,695
Just the wife and Sinan, bless him.
He helps out.

636
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,169
- Thanks, Mrs Mukhtar. It was great.
- Thank you.

637
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:26,289
And there's number four,
the youngest girl, Cemile.

638
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:30,933
No one except her.
She's the last, an afterthought.

639
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,612
We manage, thank the Lord.

640
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,774
And when friends like you turn up,
it's an honor and delight.

641
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:42,211
But I tell you,
the meat is out of this world.

642
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,458
- Isn't it?
- It's lamb, right?

643
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:49,774
Lamb. It's all we eat, chief.
We only eat lamb at home.

644
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:54,613
- Some don't. They say it smells.
- They say that.

645
00:59:54,780 --> 01:00:00,855
But lamb is the meat to eat.

646
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:05,172
- Why aren't you having any?
- I just have.

647
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:10,289
- Can't you fix the fellow a sandwich?
- I am, mukhtar. Don't worry.

648
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,337
Sure, we have to feed our main man.

649
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,095
- Thanks a lot.
- Enjoy it, Mr Prosecutor.

650
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,933
- Doctor, that's pure comb honey.
- Comb honey?

651
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:27,059
- Right. A must for putting on bread.
- Mukhtar, it's delicious, really.

652
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,336
Could you spare me a small jar?

653
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:35,215
Sinan! Find a jar this size.
Clean it up, and get your aunt

654
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,976
to fill it with honey.

655
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,814
They'll pick it up when they go.

656
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,136
Don't hold back, for goodness sake.

657
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:53,531
Some more bread. And pickles.

658
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:57,376
- There you go.
- It's the wind.

659
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:02,417
The same thing happened yesterday.
It'll come back in 15 minutes.

660
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:05,094
Mukhtar, forget the morgue.
Get the village electricity fixed.

661
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,693
First, the electricity.

662
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,899
What was that saying about
having no money to..? Never mind.

663
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,376
Mr. Naci, we have many problems.
They're all important.

664
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,178
But this is the wind.

665
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,012
Cemile!

666
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,455
Cemile, come here a minute, girl!

667
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,219
Two lamps.

668
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:25,652
One for the toilet, one for here.
Off you go now.

669
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,251
It'll come back.
It will.

670
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,455
It'll come back.

671
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:40,253
God give us health before all else.
Electricity, water, the rest will come.

672
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:52,253
The wind's been wild
this past week, you know.

673
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,258
Cemile!

674
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,658
Thanks a lot.

675
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,653
Cemile, my girl!

676
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:06,456
- Mukhtar, where was that toilet?
- You can't go on your own.

677
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,857
Here, wait. Let me lead the way.

678
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,009
You follow me.

679
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,775
Let's have a smoke.

680
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,450
Bring the lamps in here, girl.
Look, I told you two lamps.

681
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,612
Mr. Naci, come on.

682
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,138
It's no good without you.

683
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:31,294
Don't think I didn't see you laugh
when I mentioned elections just now.

684
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,737
He who holds the honey jar
gets to lick his fingers, right?

685
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:39,178
And you say
you'd never marry from here.

686
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,979
Thanks.

687
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,738
Yasar!

688
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,890
Aren't you dead?

689
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,493
Kenan!

690
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,090
Hey, Kenan!

691
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,819
C'mon, get up!

692
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,739
I'm not done with you yet.
Get up!

693
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:52,660
What did I say? No sleeping
before we're done with this!

694
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,539
Now get up!
Izzet, bring him along.

695
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:36,415
- Shall I get the store opened for soda?
- No, forget food and drink.

696
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:44,332
Is there nothing to sit on in there?

697
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,253
- Shall I bring a chair, chief?
- No, forget it.

698
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:58,051
You got to allow for that," he says.
"You have her left or right in bed?."

699
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,131
So I say, "What's the difference?".

700
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:06,170
He goes, "Do it the other way round
and you'll get one hell of a headache."

701
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:40,419
Well, a mukhtar like that
produces an angel like that..

702
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,175
Extraordinary.

703
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,137
But what a waste.

704
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:57,008
She'll just fade away
in this godforsaken village.

705
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,419
The beautiful usually have
a bad fortune, doctor.

706
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:05,972
So why did you say that woman died?

707
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,014
Which woman?

708
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,974
The woman you described as gorgeous?

709
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,739
Your friend's wife.

710
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:19,371
What was the cause of her death?
I mean, what did the doctors say?

711
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:23,052
There really was no cause.

712
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:30,170
As I said,
it was the most bizarre death.

713
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,051
One day, the guy said to his wife...

714
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:48,977
"Let's sell the old banger by autumn
and get a decent car instead."

715
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:53,775
The woman answered,
"Do what you like."

716
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,653
"I won't be here in autumn anyway.
I'll be dead."

717
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:03,215
The guy made nothing of it at first.
He thought his wife was joking.

718
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:06,818
But the woman said,
"It's no joke. I'm serious."

719
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:11,378
"I tell you, I'm going to die
after having the baby," she said.

720
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,498
The guy was annoyed naturally.

721
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:19,211
But he didn't dwell on it too much
because the woman was pregnant.

722
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,056
As you know, women tend to be
a bit volatile when they're pregnant.

723
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:27,259
They can get terribly gloomy.
So the guy put it down to that.

724
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,571
He didn't dwell on her words.

725
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,135
But...

726
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,132
...the next day,
it was the same words again.

727
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,897
Then came the day of the birth.

728
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:44,339
It went quite normally
and they had a healthy baby girl.

729
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:49,212
Before long, the woman was at home
lying in bed...

730
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:52,653
...and wanted to cuddle the baby.

731
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:57,050
So they brought her the baby.

732
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:01,334
The woman gave the baby
a kiss and a cuddle and so on.

733
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,173
And afterwards...

734
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,179
...she said,
"Well, I can die now."

735
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:15,654
And sure enough, she died soon after
right in front of everyone's eyes.

736
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,656
There you go, doctor.
Those are the facts.

737
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:23,973
She died the very minute
she said she would.

738
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:32,293
Let's see what sense
you can make of them now.

739
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,695
Well, was there an autopsy?

740
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,092
Why?

741
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,376
To get a clearer picture
of the cause of death.

742
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,259
You haven't been listening.
The cause of death was clear.

743
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,854
Anyway, if there'd been
anything suspicious...

744
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,499
...you think I'd have let it go?

745
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:52,174
No one dies
because they say they will.

746
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:54,655
She must have poisoned herself
or something.

747
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,412
Poisoned herself?

748
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,854
What gives you that idea, doctor?

749
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,854
If there'd been anything suspicious,
wouldn't we have acted on it?

750
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,409
I'm a prosecutor.
It's my job to be suspicious.

751
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:09,858
We'd have looked into it, of course.
But the doctors said a heart attack.

752
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:13,769
There was a report saying so then.

753
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,130
Honestly, I still think...

754
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,136
...an autopsy
would have been better.

755
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:24,088
Come on! You don't need an autopsy
if the cause of death is clear.

756
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,735
Because it was clear.

757
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,698
A heart attack.

758
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,979
You'd be right,
if the cause of death was unknown.

759
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,777
Besides,...

760
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,409
...her family
saw no need for an autopsy.

761
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:45,769
Carving up
a beautiful young woman for no reason.

762
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:55,578
There you have it, doctor,
how the loveliest woman left this life.

763
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:58,895
But then, there's also this.

764
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:04,737
Some drugs can trigger it,
but obviously I can't tell now.

765
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,253
What?

766
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:10,897
Some drugs can trigger
a heart attack if taken in high doses.

767
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,974
It just came to mind.

768
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:19,898
- Mr. Nusret, how about a tea?
- No, thanks. I've had some already.

769
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,290
- Don't be shy, for heaven's sake.
- Thanks, mukhtar.

770
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,373
I'm so embarrassed
about the power failure.

771
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,932
But there's nothing I can do.

772
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:45,172
Mr Prosecutor,
can you come here a minute?

773
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,852
- It's got a bit complicated.
- How?

774
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,495
The guy says it's his kid.

775
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:02,978
- Which kid?
- The victim Yasar's son.

776
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:07,578
Yasar supposedly didn't know.
He thought he was the father.

777
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:12,817
He says on the night of the incident
he was drunk and it just slipped out.

778
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:18,850
You want to come and have a word?

779
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,690
Let me have a word then.

780
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,490
- Is that 'bazlama' bread?
- Yes.

781
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:33,777
- It smells great.
- Help yourself.

782
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,051
Thanks. I'm full actually but..

783
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,611
- The smell.
- Right.

784
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,171
- Arab!
- Boss?

785
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:18,051
Come here, c'mon!

786
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:29,017
- Give me a cigarette.
- What?

787
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,537
Give me a cigarette.

788
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,019
Hand it over.

789
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,735
That mayor's daughter..

790
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,418
She's beautiful.

791
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:59,451
It's here.

792
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,776
Abidin, record that before it's ruined.
Then put them in an envelope.

793
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,378
What the hell is that?

794
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,493
God, all we needed was a dog.

795
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,538
Shoo! Fuck off!

796
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:52,133
Shoo!

797
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,893
Izzet!

798
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,738
Mr Prosecutor!

799
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:46,096
We've found it.

800
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,818
Diggers, move it! Faster!

801
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,172
Just don't touch!

802
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,418
Let Abidin get it on camera first.
Abidin!

803
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,976
Over here!

804
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,415
I expect the dogs dug it up, right?

805
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,656
I expect so.

806
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:07,771
OK, that'll do. That's fine.

807
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,178
Hayrettin, let's...

808
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,253
Start gently from the edges.
Dig around him like this.

809
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:16,969
Then lift him out here. OK?
Now take it slowly.

810
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:19,893
Careful! Hold it there. Not the head!

811
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:23,018
- Look, grab the shoulders.
- The shoulders.

812
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:27,728
- Slowly! Slow down.
- Give that here. Hold this.

813
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:39,258
He'll come out now.

814
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:57,091
Go on, lift him.

815
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,494
There we go.
Tevfik, give a hand here.

816
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:04,489
Goodness sake!

817
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,209
Careful, guys, for God's sake!

818
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,333
Don't turn him over.
Lift him as he is, guys.

819
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:12,979
Two, three..

820
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:16,735
Here, over here. Bring him over!

821
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,411
Put him here.

822
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:30,373
Arab! Pull up his trousers.

823
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:41,692
OK.

824
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:11,418
Look at that!

825
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:17,658
What way is that to tie someone up?
Is that human, Mr Prosecutor?

826
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,450
It's inhuman!

827
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:27,655
Look, you killed him,
but why tie him up like that?

828
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:32,650
What about respect for the dead?
Got none of that either? Sadist shit!

829
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:36,296
- Naci, just calm down.
- Look at him! Why tie the guy up?

830
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,576
- Naci!
- You're not human!

831
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:45,253
Naci, calm down for God's sake! Huh?
Look, we still have work to do here!

832
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:49,013
- You're not human! Sadist shit!
- Naci!

833
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:52,536
Naci, come over here. Come on.

834
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:58,733
- Look, you've done a good job.
- They shouldn't be treated like humans!

835
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:02,449
They just deserve
to be tied up just like him.

836
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,538
OK. Come over here.

837
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:15,377
I'm the one who killed Yasar.

838
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,020
Shut the fuck up! Moron!

839
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,648
Your work's done.
The rest is my job.

840
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,811
Just calm down. Huh?

841
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:32,256
Let's get the job done
as fast as possible.

842
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,897
Yes, now let's...

843
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,097
Let's continue.

844
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:51,656
Doctor, let's now draft
a crime scene investigation report.

845
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:54,215
- Sure.
- Abidin, you get ready too.

846
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:57,014
Tevfik's getting the laptop
from the car, Mr Prosecutor.

847
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,569
Quick! Hurry!
There's still a lot to do.

848
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:01,253
Bring it here.

849
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,016
Take this to the car.

850
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:12,209
Almost ready, Mr Prosecutor.

851
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,178
Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

852
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:21,131
Get typing then.

853
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:27,014
Location: Kizilcullu.

854
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:32,219
...in the north of
the administrative district...

855
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:36,450
Sergeant, what do you say?
Is this Kizilcullu here?

856
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,418
Well, Mr Prosecutor,
it's like this.

857
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,016
The Fountain
is right on the border.

858
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:45,809
This side is Saricullu,
the other side Kizilcullu.

859
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:49,612
- So?
- Well, it's quite simple.

860
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:53,211
Suppose we drew a line
between us and the fountain.

861
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:58,491
This side to the north is Kizilcullu
and the south side Saricullu.

862
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:01,058
- Sir...
- Meaning?

863
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:04,371
Well, if you look
at the map coordinates...

864
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:07,732
...it'll tell you exactly
whether this is Kizilcullu or..

865
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,619
Well, we could say Kizilcullu,
but it also tends towards Saricullu.

866
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:14,739
Being outside the municipal limits,
I know this point very well.

867
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:18,336
- The municipal map actually marks this...
- OK.

868
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:25,053
- ... as the exact boundary point.
- OK. Location, Saricullu.

869
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:28,528
...in the vicinity of Kavurgali village...

870
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:33,978
...around how many km
from the municipal seat?

871
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:40,690
- I'd say we've come 30 km.
- We're currently 37 km away, sir.

872
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:46,016
...37 km from the municipal seat.

873
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:54,418
A visit was made to the field beside
the fountain at the above location.

874
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,649
Within the said roadside field..

875
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:03,729
It's a good 25-30 m, right?

876
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:06,130
- I can measure it, sir.
- No need, sergeant.

877
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:10,578
It was verified
that the corpse lay buried...

878
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:14,449
...some 30 m from the edge.

879
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,935
The ground was dug up...

880
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:24,849
...and the body exhumed
by the appointed officers.

881
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,052
It was observed...

882
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:36,094
...that the corpse...

883
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:41,130
...had been hogtied.

884
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,936
- Have you got that?
- Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

885
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,931
The rope was cut.

886
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:49,013
Hayrettin, cut the rope now.

887
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,138
No, not here.

888
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:53,813
That's right.

889
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:03,578
That's it.

890
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,815
Turn him over on his back.

891
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:21,814
Yes, now.

892
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,298
Open a new paragraph.

893
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:26,576
- Abidin.
- Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

894
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,770
The corpse was clothed...

895
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:37,410
...in a pair of dark blue,
heavy-duty work trousers...

896
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:44,655
...and a yellow and grey shirt.
- Your man's going for it.

897
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:49,334
- He's twittering.
- We slog all night, you just revel.

898
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:52,853
- New paragraph, Abidin.
- Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

899
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:57,492
The thing to be in life
is a master of revels.

900
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,650
Tevfik, count this.

901
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:06,413
The male corpse measured 180 cm tall.

902
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:11,454
How old is the victim, doctor?

903
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:15,133
- I think we could say 35-40.
- You are right.

904
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,097
Was aged 35-40...

905
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:25,816
...looked like Clark Gable...

906
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:32,976
...weighed an estimated 80-90 kg..

907
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:51,659
Abidin, you've got that
word for word, huh?

908
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:04,538
You look a bit like Clark Gable,
you know, Mr Prosecutor?

909
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:07,410
- Sorry, but...
- OK, stop the banter.

910
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:10,219
Let's be serious now.

911
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:12,336
Where were we?

912
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:16,698
- Weighed an estimated 80-90 kg..
- Yes, 80-90 kg.

913
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:20,409
Had a moustache...

914
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:26,658
...and three-four days' beard growth.

915
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:32,219
It was verified that rigor mortis...
What shall we say here, doctor?

916
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:36,935
We could say
rigor mortis had worn off.

917
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:38,409
OK.

918
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:43,654
It was verified that rigor mortis
had worn off in the arms and legs.

919
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,099
Have you got that?

920
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:50,450
Due to physical circumstances...
Well, what shall we say?

921
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:54,374
We can't do an autopsy here,
so let's say something like this:

922
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,612
...unsuitable conditions necessitated...

923
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:01,774
...that an autopsy be performed
at the state hospital.

924
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:03,578
You're right. Yes.

925
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:06,812
Due to circumstances being ill-suited
to the performance of an autopsy...

926
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:13,016
...and because hospital conditions
would be more appropriate...

927
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:20,931
...it was decided to have
a conventional autopsy performed...

928
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:25,449
...to transfer the corpse to town...

929
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:28,939
...to establish
the exact cause of death...

930
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:32,653
...to drive the corpse to town...

931
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:34,890
...in one of
the investigation vehicles.

932
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:36,334
That's OK, isn't it?

933
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,497
- Right, Mr Prosecutor.
- Yes.

934
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:42,968
Hayrettin! Go and get him ready
to take away.

935
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:46,617
Put him in a body bag first.

936
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:05,817
At university...

937
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,700
...people used to
call me Clark Nusret...

938
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:11,294
...by the way.

939
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:16,610
But really, you look a lot
like Clark Gable, Mr Prosecutor.

940
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,018
No body bag.

941
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,373
- No?
- No.

942
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:37,258
- You didn't bring the body bag?
- Did you?

943
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:40,380
- But I told you!
- What's up?

944
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:44,414
Tevfik forgot the body bag,
Mr Prosecutor.

945
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:46,730
Bringing body bags isn't my job!

946
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:49,698
- I told you to get it though.
- When did you tell me?

947
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:50,736
OK, cut it out!

948
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:54,575
- Before going to the courthouse.
- Cut it out!

949
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:02,972
How could you forget
the goddamn body bag?

950
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,578
You knew where we were going!

951
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:13,978
Hayrettin, grab a blanket.
Run! Quick!

952
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:19,977
When did your village
ever turn out any real men?

953
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:22,610
Quick!

954
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,777
Look who's talking!
Ratting at the first chance...

955
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:27,977
You guys lend a hand too!

956
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:33,054
OK, let's do this head to toe.

957
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:37,818
You go there.

958
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:40,371
Will you help, sergeant?

959
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:46,369
Come on!

960
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:51,972
Put on his shoes.

961
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,778
- Grab the rope. It's evidence, right?
- Of course.

962
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:03,376
Fold it over like me.
Go on, fold it!

963
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:07,173
OK, one, two, three..

964
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:13,532
Sergeant, bring my laptop, OK?

965
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:16,893
And don't forget the evidence.
Look, there on the ground.

966
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:18,973
Izzet, c'mon!

967
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,650
Really, I'm curious, you know.

968
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:43,695
Seeing as you killed the guy,
why go and tie him up like this?

969
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:46,935
He didn't fit in the car otherwise.

970
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:49,694
Oh, really?

971
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,897
Why on earth
didn't we get an ambulance?

972
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:56,370
I phoned for one before we set out,
but the ambulance had broken down.

973
01:39:56,540 --> 01:40:00,533
- I'll call again now, if you like.
- We're not waiting for that as well.

974
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,371
Now, what are we doing?
Which boot is bigger?

975
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:07,169
- Arab's is, capacity-wise.
- C'mon, Tevfik!

976
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:10,335
This boot's bigger than yours?

977
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:13,735
Right, there's the LPG tank.

978
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:16,699
- In this one too.
- He won't fit in either.

979
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:19,010
What do we do then?

980
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:23,412
Oh, God!

981
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:29,098
What should we do? I wonder
if we should hogtie him again?

982
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:30,614
What?

983
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:34,769
He won't fit unless he's tied up.
Look.

984
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,894
No, there's no need
for tying him up.

985
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:42,372
If we bend him forwards
he'll probably fit. Let's try.

986
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:47,177
- OK, let's try then.
- Quick, the rain is on its way.

987
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:50,174
Here, c'mon. Turn him like this.

988
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:52,293
Easy does it.

989
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:54,053
Now bend him.

990
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:56,769
Now the head.

991
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:00,376
Head forwards.

992
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:05,298
- There, OK. C'mon..
- OK. One, two, three, here we go!

993
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:07,776
Leave his head like that.
That's it.

994
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:10,251
Lift! C'mon, Tevfik, lift!

995
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:14,379
- OK, careful.
- Slowly now.

996
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:20,049
That won't do.
Lift from there.

997
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:22,259
OK, don't yell, Arab.

998
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:24,297
Put the feet down.

999
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,899
Watch out, Tevfik!

1000
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:27,579
What the fuck you want?

1001
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:30,931
Right, OK.

1002
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:33,695
Hayrettin! You and Ethem
switch to this car.

1003
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:35,612
OK, hold it. Let go.

1004
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:41,809
- Easy, Arab! You'll bust my head.
- Izzet! You and Kenan in my car!

1005
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:58,976
C'mon, Arab!

1006
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:14,613
I had two years on the murder desk
before here.

1007
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:17,897
With Sacit, now the boss in Antep.
I hope his ears are burning.

1008
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:21,132
He was a great guy,
though no better than you.

1009
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:24,929
He'd say wherever you find
a can of worms, look for a woman.

1010
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:27,973
Be sure to look for
an issue with a woman.

1011
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:32,293
And truly, all these years
the guy hasn't once proved wrong.

1012
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:37,660
Right, but this guy
was a right son of a gun, boss.

1013
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:41,290
- Who?
- The dead guy.

1014
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:43,577
Live like a rat, die like a rat.

1015
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:46,573
I wouldn't know about that.
I don't want to either.

1016
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:49,289
That's it for me, my friend.

1017
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:52,299
My job's done.
It's over to the prosecutor now.

1018
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:55,970
Let him clear up the mess.
It's not my business.

1019
01:42:56,820 --> 01:43:01,291
Doctor, what time's the autopsy?
Remember I wanted that prescription?

1020
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:05,375
I don't know what time it'll be.
But I'll be there.

1021
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:08,009
- Come whenever you like.
- OK. Thanks.

1022
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:11,490
Let me not forget it,
or the wife will, you know..

1023
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,374
Too bad, chief. Looks like
you've started smoking again.

1024
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:17,259
Well, doctor. I give up,
but the damn thing won't give me up.

1025
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:20,093
You were doing so well.
What happened all of a sudden?

1026
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:23,218
It wasn't all of a sudden, doctor.

1027
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:25,816
I've been a policeman 20 years.

1028
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:30,298
The types I've seen.
Man or beast? You can't tell.

1029
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:34,291
Then there's the likes of Kenan.
I mean, they're different.

1030
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:39,090
They're.. How can I say?
It's like they get you...

1031
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:43,698
...with that nerve,
that thing they have.

1032
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:46,451
At the mayor's place...

1033
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:50,854
...the guy says, "He's my brother.
My mum left him in my hands."

1034
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:55,378
"Don't do this or that to him."
He's almost saying, "Let him go."

1035
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:01,531
I whacked him again and said,
"Stop giving us the run-around!".

1036
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:05,855
And you know what he says to me?
"You're a decent guy."

1037
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:08,137
"The boy's mine."

1038
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:11,458
"Can you watch out for him
while I'm in jail," he says.

1039
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:14,692
- Was he talking about Yasar's boy?
- Right. Yasar's boy.

1040
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:17,932
- He says he's the father.
- No way. That's a lie.

1041
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:19,454
Do you laugh or cry?

1042
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:24,774
I beat the guy up and he makes me
responsible for his son.

1043
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:29,971
The other day I saw your boy
playing in the park with his mum.

1044
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:32,734
- He looked fine.
- He is. Just fine.

1045
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:36,051
There's no problem
as long as he takes his pills.

1046
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:40,494
And he's one smart kid.
The answers he comes up with..

1047
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:44,137
They say his illness has to do with
having an extra-high IQ.

1048
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,494
Right.

1049
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:48,493
But the wife never stops
saying the same thing.

1050
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:52,371
"Why did God pick us?" she says.
I mean, why us?

1051
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:56,735
I say, "You can't fight it.
You can't ask questions like that."

1052
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:59,335
It's a sin. You can't question it.

1053
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:04,335
There's a reason for everything,
end of story. If it's meant to be...

1054
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:34,059
Move along, c'mon.

1055
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:48,498
Calm now, guys!

1056
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:52,814
Move over this way, my friend.
The doctor will fill you in.

1057
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:55,096
- Over this way now.
- Can't you tell us something?

1058
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,411
They will!
Now move along. This way. Guys!

1059
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:01,572
- Fill us in, chief.
- OK, they will! Move over!

1060
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:03,088
Clear the way.

1061
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:08,014
Izzet, put him
in the gendarmerie car.

1062
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:09,169
The gendarmerie car.

1063
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:10,898
He's going to the courthouse.

1064
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:13,733
You know the procedure.
Take them both to the courthouse.

1065
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:15,538
All right, sir.

1066
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:20,219
Bastard!

1067
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:30,059
Move back!

1068
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:43,972
Bastard!

1069
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:52,731
- Murderer! Hand him over!
- Bastard!

1070
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:55,848
Look, I've seen you all!

1071
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:58,739
Hey, leave off!
Stop hitting the car!

1072
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:03,333
Murderer! Bastard!

1073
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,251
What idiot took him out of the car?

1074
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:08,092
The prosecutor told me to, boss.

1075
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:10,171
I said it was a bad idea, but..

1076
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:11,375
OK, hold it.

1077
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:13,776
Izzet, get in the car.

1078
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:17,618
Doctor, police chief Naci
is here. He's downstairs.

1079
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:20,374
- OK, I'm on my way.
- OK.

1080
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:01,411
Morning, doctor.

1081
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:04,694
The mayor's here.
What should I tell him?

1082
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:06,658
- I'll see him later.
- All right.

1083
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:10,530
Excuse me a minute. Excuse me.

1084
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:15,368
- I'm disturbing you, doctor.
- Not at all.

1085
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:17,252
- Welcome, M. Naci.
- Thanks.

1086
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:20,378
I thought I'd get that prescription
before going home.

1087
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:22,849
- Do you mind doing it?
- No, of course not.

1088
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:27,053
- How many packs did we say? Two?
- Same as before, two.

1089
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:32,771
I'll do it right away.
Let me just find the pad.

1090
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:37,853
- You must be worn out after last night.
- Too right, doctor.

1091
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:43,415
Honestly, this job
is punishing after a certain age.

1092
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:46,095
But you can guess
what it's like with the boy.

1093
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:48,615
It's hard to stick around at home.

1094
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:53,931
You find you can't take it.
So you go off to work again.

1095
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:57,372
That's right.

1096
01:52:57,780 --> 01:53:02,171
- It's the only thing to do.
- For me it is. But why for you?

1097
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:07,529
You're still so young.
Believe me, if I were you...

1098
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:13,180
...I'd pack my bags and clear off
without a second thought, damn it!

1099
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:18,610
- Where to?
- Wherever.

1100
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:36,813
I shouldn't rant on at you
so early in the morning, doctor.

1101
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:38,618
No, please.

1102
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:43,212
You're a city boy, doctor.
You don't know how tough life is here.

1103
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:47,733
Especially if you're a boy
and your dad's never around.

1104
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:51,100
That's why I feel
a bit sorry for the kid.

1105
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:54,332
You think Kenan
is really the father?

1106
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:56,852
No idea.

1107
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:01,971
But after the kid threw a stone at him
he cried all the way to the courthouse.

1108
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:06,773
It's the kids who suffer
in the end, doctor.

1109
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:10,098
Everyone pays for the things they do.

1110
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:14,010
But kids pay for the sins of adults.

1111
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:53,213
- So he turned up in Girmacakil?
- Yes.

1112
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:57,539
That's at least 40-50 km away.
You did well to find him.

1113
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:02,011
God, what were they doing
taking him all the way there?

1114
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:03,819
Well, they just did.

1115
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:08,451
I couldn't sleep that morning,
so I opened the pharmacy early.

1116
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:10,578
At 7.30 or so.

1117
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:13,933
I looked over and saw
the door to Yasar's place open.

1118
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:18,099
'God, ' I thought. 'What's the guy
doing here at this hour?'

1119
01:57:18,260 --> 01:57:22,731
And what was weirder,
he had a paintbrush in his hand.

1120
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:24,811
And he was painting
the shutters at that hour.

1121
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:27,448
Anyway, I went home and back
in the meantime.

1122
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:31,255
When I got back, the place was shut
and the painting left half-finished.

1123
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:33,213
Fate..

1124
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:35,970
Well, you know the tea man, Riza?

1125
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:38,979
He swears he saw Yasar in Kirikkale
only yesterday evening?

1126
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:40,812
No way.
The asshole's lying again.

1127
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:42,208
Yesterday evening?

1128
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:44,416
Come on! The guy died days ago.

1129
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:48,736
What do I know? Riza says
he called out, but he didn't hear.

1130
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:51,932
He was walking along
in a world of his own.

1131
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:47,412
- Come in, doctor. What's up?
- Morning, Hamit.

1132
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,609
- Morning.
- How are you?

1133
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:53,416
- Fine, thanks. Have a tea.
- No, thanks. I was just passing.

1134
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:55,576
What are you making us for lunch?

1135
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:59,619
Green beans, soup and salad.

1136
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:07,617
- Did you say beans?
- Yes, beans.

1137
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:11,617
- Any meat in it?
- No, no meat.

1138
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:16,935
What's he up to?

1139
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:24,616
- He was hungry so I gave him breakfast.
- Good for you.

1140
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:15,174
Hello?

1141
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:23,374
OK, Abidin.

1142
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:25,174
Good.

1143
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:40,409
The autopsy room will be ready
in five or ten minutes.

1144
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:44,179
- They'll give us a call.
- OK.

1145
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:25,735
What's up, Mr Prosecutor?

1146
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:30,132
Well, doctor. You're some guy.

1147
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:32,379
What does that mean?

1148
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:36,215
I've reached this age and never met
anyone as skeptical as you.

1149
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:39,413
- What's happened?
- Nothing.

1150
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:46,818
It's just been
weighing on me a bit.

1151
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:48,739
What?

1152
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:52,897
That drug business. Remember
you talked about certain drugs...

1153
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:56,218
...being able to cause a heart attack
if taken in high doses?

1154
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:58,371
Yes, there are drugs like that.
Why?

1155
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:02,059
What I don't understand is this.

1156
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:08,299
Why would the woman suddenly
take the drugs for no good reason?

1157
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:12,814
Maybe there was a personal problem
she couldn't deal with.

1158
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:17,459
She wanted to kill herself
and be spared. How do I know?

1159
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:19,338
Kill herself?

1160
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:22,618
What suddenly gives you that idea?

1161
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:27,419
- Nothing, I...
- You're so bizarre, you know.

1162
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:31,218
I'm just guessing.

1163
02:02:36,580 --> 02:02:40,619
If the woman was so troubled,
wouldn't it show?

1164
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:42,492
Yes, of course.

1165
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:48,252
Her friends, her husband
should have realized.

1166
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:53,098
- Were they on good terms?
- Huh?

1167
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:58,613
- Did they get along well?
- Sure. Very well.

1168
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:01,773
Why?

1169
02:03:04,660 --> 02:03:07,049
I don't know, just asking.

1170
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:20,613
True, they had a few minor problems.
But I mean...

1171
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:25,414
- ... the kind you get in any family.
- I see.

1172
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:30,098
Only...

1173
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:38,695
...one day, she caught her husband
with another woman.

1174
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:41,939
They didn't make a thing of it.
She forgave him right away.

1175
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:46,817
But women don't easily forgive
that sort of thing.

1176
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:51,455
She did though.
She really forgave him.

1177
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:56,931
They didn't even mention it again.

1178
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:00,535
Well, there you go.

1179
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:04,056
The woman made up her mind
to kill herself right back then.

1180
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:08,015
She waited until after the birth
so as not to harm the baby.

1181
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:09,613
No, come on!

1182
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:13,417
I really don't think so.

1183
02:04:15,940 --> 02:04:19,410
For one thing, the guy
did nothing really wrong.

1184
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:23,974
It was some ridiculous thing
that happened when he was drunk.

1185
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:27,212
Nothing to write home about.
You couldn't even call it cheating.

1186
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:32,410
The woman must have thought the same
because she forgave the guy right off.

1187
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:38,169
No one dies just like that.
There's no such thing in medicine.

1188
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:41,488
Well.

1189
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:47,692
What sort of drugs are you talking?
The kind sold over the counter?

1190
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:51,576
- Sure. Digoxin, for example.
- Digoxin?

1191
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:55,455
It's a heart drug. High doses
cause a heart attack.

1192
02:04:57,940 --> 02:05:00,613
- There are others too.
- No, I know Digoxin.

1193
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:03,613
My father-in-law took it.

1194
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:08,209
- Small, yellow tablets?
- Yes. They come like that too.

1195
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:11,931
Digoxin, huh?

1196
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:16,449
Hello?

1197
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:19,652
What's going on, Sakir?

1198
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:25,019
We should come down?

1199
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:30,810
We'll come down then.

1200
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:34,211
OK, we're on our way.

1201
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:40,054
The autopsy room's ready.
We can go, Mr Prosecutor.

1202
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:51,019
Mr Prosecutor?

1203
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:00,657
Shall we go, Mr Prosecutor?

1204
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:03,694
Let's go, doctor.

1205
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:08,219
- After you.
- Look, doctor..

1206
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:11,810
Would a person...

1207
02:06:12,620 --> 02:06:14,770
...really kill themselves...

1208
02:06:15,580 --> 02:06:20,370
...to punish someone else?
Would they do that, doctor.

1209
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:28,098
Aren't most suicides intended
to punish someone else, Mr Prosecutor?

1210
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:34,609
Yes, aren't they?

1211
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:37,935
Bravo.

1212
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:42,177
That's what I thought.

1213
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:47,814
That's it, of course.

1214
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:55,213
Let's go. What are we waiting for?

1215
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:12,455
My wife...

1216
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:22,219
Women can sometimes be
very ruthless, doctor. Really.

1217
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:24,179
Very.

1218
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:45,572
Hello, guys.

1219
02:08:46,860 --> 02:08:48,691
- Are we all set?
- Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

1220
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:50,169
Good.

1221
02:08:55,220 --> 02:08:59,133
- Who's going to identify the body?
- His wife's outside, Mr Prosecutor.

1222
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:03,214
OK, call her in.
Let's get started right away.

1223
02:09:07,820 --> 02:09:09,936
Mrs. Toprak, this way.
Come on in.

1224
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:14,897
- How are you, Sakir?
- Fine, thanks, Mr Prosecutor.

1225
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:17,694
- Here, in here.
- What happened with the accountant?

1226
02:09:17,940 --> 02:09:21,728
I talked to him, Mr Prosecutor.
But it's no use.

1227
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:23,618
The accountant's no use.

1228
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:25,418
Whatever. It'll work out.

1229
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:28,811
- Because these instruments...
- I understand, OK.

1230
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:33,818
- Stand by the prosecutor, please.
- Over here, young lady.

1231
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:45,612
Are you Gulnaz Toprak?

1232
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:47,448
OK.

1233
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:50,658
Pull the sheet down, Sakir.

1234
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:59,337
Is this your husband?

1235
02:10:04,700 --> 02:10:05,735
Huh?

1236
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:11,658
Mrs. Toprak?

1237
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:16,093
Is this your husband?

1238
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:23,457
I'm asking if it's your husband.

1239
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:26,495
Yes.

1240
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:30,419
Are you sure?

1241
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:34,695
OK.

1242
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:40,210
Cover him up, Sakir.

1243
02:10:43,780 --> 02:10:47,170
Now, where were we? OK.

1244
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:52,809
Then his wife Gulnaz Toprak
was admitted to view the body.

1245
02:10:53,620 --> 02:10:55,815
She was duly sworn in.

1246
02:10:57,660 --> 02:10:59,810
- Are you typing this, Abidin?
- Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

1247
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:04,418
She was shown the body
and asked to identify it.

1248
02:11:06,180 --> 02:11:09,889
And she answered,
"The body you've shown me..."

1249
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:14,129
"... belongs to my husband,
Yasar Toprak."

1250
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:25,214
"His mother's name was Hatice,
his father's name Rustem."

1251
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:29,013
"He was born in 1979."

1252
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:36,249
"Yes, I went to the prosecutor
as he hadn't been home for two days."

1253
02:11:36,940 --> 02:11:39,215
- Is that right, young lady?
- Yes.

1254
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:43,933
"I don't know how he died."

1255
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:48,418
"I have thus identified the body."

1256
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:51,528
- Have you got that, Abidin?
- Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

1257
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:55,370
But let me see what you've written.

1258
02:11:56,340 --> 02:12:00,219
- Last thing was "identified the body."
- No! You don't type it there.

1259
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:03,213
How many times have I told you?
Type above, leaving a space below.

1260
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:06,577
- I'll do it again. The date.
- Go on, type the date.

1261
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:11,690
But look, that's too much now.
Delete that.

1262
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:14,530
- Here too?
- Yes, there too.

1263
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:17,692
So there's space
for the doctor's autopsy report.

1264
02:12:21,580 --> 02:12:26,529
- Cut that too. Yes, there.
- I'll paste it here.

1265
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:31,536
Good. Look, now it's all moved down.

1266
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:36,092
No, move them up.
His father's and mother's names.

1267
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:38,854
OK, I'm moving them up.

1268
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:47,650
- OK, now start typing here.
- OK, Mr Prosecutor.

1269
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:52,652
Yes.

1270
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:54,498
Where were we?

1271
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:56,574
Yes.

1272
02:12:57,620 --> 02:13:02,614
OK, young lady. You're done.
You can go. My condolences to you.

1273
02:13:04,780 --> 02:13:08,216
Mrs. Toprak, just wait
in the corridor for a bit.

1274
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:27,055
Mr Prosecutor, he had a watch
a ring and the like on him.

1275
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:31,378
- Should I hand them over right now?
- Yes. Put them in an envelope first.

1276
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,529
And his clothes as well?
I mean, after taking them off.

1277
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:39,735
Yes. Once they're off,
put them in a bag and hand them over.

1278
02:13:39,980 --> 02:13:43,017
They're torn and bloodstained.
That's why I'm asking.

1279
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:45,808
That's OK.

1280
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:33,219
Yes, we can continue, Mr Prosecutor.

1281
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:50,979
- Huh?
- I'm ready.

1282
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:53,457
- Are you back?
- Yes.

1283
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:08,297
Yes, OK then. Now let's...

1284
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:14,849
Let's move on to the doctor.

1285
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:18,812
The doctor was admitted
to view the body.

1286
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:22,656
He was duly sworn in.

1287
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:27,334
He was shown the body.

1288
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:33,289
He was asked the cause of death.

1289
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:39,059
He answered,
"Because the cause of death..."

1290
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:43,410
"... cannot be established
within the scope of the evidence..."

1291
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:46,728
".there is call for
a conventional autopsy."

1292
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:49,409
Absolutely.

1293
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:09,058
Yes.

1294
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:12,891
Yes, doctor.

1295
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:16,217
That's it.

1296
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:19,815
The ball's in your court.

1297
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:22,858
I'm off.

1298
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:31,613
- Send me a copy of the report.
- OK, Mr Prosecutor.

1299
02:16:33,180 --> 02:16:35,853
- Take it easy then.
- Thanks, Mr Prosecutor.

1300
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:49,651
Have a good day, Mr Prosecutor.

1301
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:06,010
Let's get started, shall we?

1302
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:08,932
- Ready, Abidin?
- Yes, Dr Cemal.

1303
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:12,092
- Sakir, you? Shall we start?
- Sure, doctor.

1304
02:17:12,260 --> 02:17:14,376
- Let's start, but...
- What?

1305
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:18,532
Well, I told the prosecutor.
You heard. But he won't listen.

1306
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:22,176
- Listen to what?
- We have such lousy equipment, doctor.

1307
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:26,015
How can you do an autopsy
with this kit, for God's sake?

1308
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:28,569
What's the problem?
We do it all the time.

1309
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:33,291
Sure, but.. You'll probably say
there's no alternative, but there is.

1310
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:35,537
- What's that?
- Look.

1311
02:17:36,140 --> 02:17:37,937
The other day
we went to Kirikkale.

1312
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:42,412
That new hospital wing was opened.
The prosecutor took me along.

1313
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:46,688
The guys had built a morgue,
a truly amazing morgue.

1314
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:50,138
And I know the head physician there,
he doesn't have a clue.

1315
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:53,292
But that didn't stop them
getting first-rate equipment.

1316
02:17:53,460 --> 02:17:57,373
I'm talking autopsy instruments
which fit your hand.

1317
02:17:57,740 --> 02:18:00,698
- Don't these?
- C'mon, don't give me that.

1318
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:03,374
Now, our kit isn't bad either, but..

1319
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:07,289
For instance, they'd got
an electric version of this saw.

1320
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:10,698
The saw's electric,
but rechargeable too.

1321
02:18:11,020 --> 02:18:15,730
Two hours on charge and use it for 24
out in the wilds, wherever you want.

1322
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:21,777
I tell the prosecutor let's get the kit
and he sends me to the accountant.

1323
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:27,572
Fine, talk to the accountant, but
he's a real jerk. He's totally clueless.

1324
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:33,258
All he's worried about is
chasing skirt at the courthouse.

1325
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:36,253
- And he can't even get it up!
- Sakir!

1326
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:40,931
- Yes?
- Take off that sheet and let's start.

1327
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:43,579
I'm worn out. I need sleep.

1328
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:49,178
OK, but I mean, I wanted to share
my troubles with you, doctor. Because...

1329
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:52,651
- Abidin! Are you ready?
- Yes, Dr Cemal.

1330
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:56,568
Shall I cut it?

1331
02:18:57,140 --> 02:18:58,937
Sure, of course.

1332
02:19:01,780 --> 02:19:04,817
Now let's start with
the body examination report.

1333
02:19:05,740 --> 02:19:08,254
Then we'll move on to
the conventional autopsy report. OK?

1334
02:19:08,420 --> 02:19:09,694
OK, Dr Cemal.

1335
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:13,216
Get typing then.

1336
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:18,609
An external examination of the body
was then commenced.

1337
02:19:19,580 --> 02:19:26,019
The body was dressed in a shirt
of orange, yellow and grey...

1338
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:30,411
...a white undershirt...

1339
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:36,138
...and dark blue,
heavy-duty work trousers.

1340
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:38,576
- Should I cut, doctor?
- Go ahead.

1341
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:43,293
A black leather belt
was observed at the waist.

1342
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:47,174
Come on, Sakir.

1343
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:54,930
The trousers were removed.

1344
02:19:59,020 --> 02:20:03,218
The body was determined
to be wearing no underpants.

1345
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:07,609
The old boy went around
ready for action!

1346
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:14,975
- The body measured 180 cm...
- Excuse me, sorry!

1347
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:17,449
- ... had three-four days' beard growth...
- Excuse me, Dr Cemal!

1348
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:19,451
- ... a moustache...
- Dr Cemal, excuse me!

1349
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:22,214
- What?
- Should I give the clothes...

1350
02:20:22,740 --> 02:20:27,416
Mrs. Toprak is out in the corridor.
Should I give her the clothes now?

1351
02:20:31,900 --> 02:20:33,379
Go on then.

1352
02:20:33,820 --> 02:20:36,129
- Give them to her in a bag.
- OK.

1353
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:38,729
Get me a bag.

1354
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:43,288
Don't hang around. Open it.

1355
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:48,291
Grab the shoes.

1356
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:51,858
- Give me that one in the corner too.
- Here.

1357
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:54,728
Now move. Make yourself useful.

1358
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:26,493
The cerebrum and cerebellum
were removed.

1359
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:33,739
Extensive subarachnoid haemorrhaging,
epidural haematoma and contusion...

1360
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:41,616
...were identified on
the cerebral and cerebellar surfaces.

1361
02:21:46,980 --> 02:21:48,174
The thorax was opened.

1362
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:50,217
Open it up, Sakir.

1363
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:58,852
Keep going down to the end.

1364
02:22:00,980 --> 02:22:03,210
Lift off the valve.

1365
02:22:10,220 --> 02:22:12,973
The sternal valve was removed.

1366
02:22:14,220 --> 02:22:18,657
Neither free fluid
nor haemorrhagic fluid...

1367
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:22,253
...were identified
in the thoracic cavity.

1368
02:22:23,460 --> 02:22:24,939
Take the heart out.

1369
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:27,609
The heart was removed.

1370
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:30,340
- The whole thing, doctor?
- Yes.

1371
02:22:32,780 --> 02:22:35,852
The cardiac valves
were found to be normal.

1372
02:22:37,300 --> 02:22:39,211
The lungs were removed.

1373
02:22:39,580 --> 02:22:41,411
Take them out, Sakir.

1374
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:01,774
Doctor!

1375
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:06,613
Doctor, can you look at this?

1376
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:14,010
Doctor, there's a...

1377
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:19,249
Look, there's dirt here
in the windpipe.

1378
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:24,332
- In this lung too, actually.
- Hold on.

1379
02:23:28,180 --> 02:23:31,013
- Doctor, dirt in the lungs...
- OK, just hold on.

1380
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:40,214
Doctor, you don't suppose
they buried him alive?

1381
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:50,570
I said, you don't think
they buried the guy alive?

1382
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:54,415
No, it's nothing like that, but..

1383
02:24:10,940 --> 02:24:14,728
Yes, Dr Cemal.
What are we saying here?

1384
02:24:18,820 --> 02:24:20,538
Let's say this.

1385
02:24:23,380 --> 02:24:25,211
No abnormalities were encountered...

1386
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:29,976
...in the trachea, oesophagus
or soft tissue of the neck.

1387
02:24:34,540 --> 02:24:37,418
The abdomen was then opened.

1388
02:24:37,900 --> 02:24:39,618
Open it up, Sakir.

1389
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:06,892
Go on!

1390
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:27,619
Doctor, why don't you step back a bit
or you'll get stuff on you.
