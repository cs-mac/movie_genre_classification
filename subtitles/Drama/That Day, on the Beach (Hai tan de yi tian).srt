1
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:38,220
I have cancer.
I have the right to medical parole.

2
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,044
You think you get to enjoy privileges
because you have cancer?

3
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:43,202
If you die early that would be letting
you off too easily.

4
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:46,832
I can't tell if it's dependence or love.

5
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:49,232
I'm scared I'll break up with him
again in the future.

6
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:50,552
Or he'll leave me behind again.

7
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:53,992
When I was fighting for my life,
I only had you in my mind.

8
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:55,785
But that kind of feeling
may not be that of lovers.

9
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:59,273
It seems you still can't forgive me.

10
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:01,477
In today's training,

11
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:05,190
I want you to get through the obstacles as
fast as you can and subdue the man in red.

12
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,867
Understand?

13
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:22,960
The next team, get ready.

14
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,636
The last team, get ready.

15
00:02:57,863 --> 00:02:59,911
Stop. The drill's over.

16
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:08,863
Is something wrong?

17
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:15,510
From your micro-expressions,
you don't appear to be frustrated by love.

18
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:19,113
I understand we shouldn't
bring our emotions to work.

19
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:22,839
But don't you feel anything
from being lovesick?

20
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:27,710
Have you been hurt so badly that
you're slow to react?

21
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:28,960
You're slow to react.

22
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:31,471
You've had your heart broken after all.

23
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,272
You should go out and drink
so you won't be so bored.

24
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,870
You'll feel better then.
I'll drink with you.

25
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:40,480
No, thanks.
I'm working the morning shift tomorrow.

26
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,989
Even if you're fine,
you can still grab a drink.

27
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:47,037
You're human. You must miss her a bit.
I'm working the morning shift too tomorrow.

28
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:48,512
You know me.

29
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:50,868
I'm working the morning shift tomorrow.
How can I go and drink with you?

30
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:54,707
Look, Brother Man, what time is it now
according to your watch?

31
00:03:55,188 --> 00:03:55,996
5:56pm.

32
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,836
Mine says 5:57pm.
Don, what about yours?

33
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,427
5:55pm.

34
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:05,684
What does that prove?
Everyone's watch has a different time.

35
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:08,038
Some are a minute fast
and some a minute slow.

36
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:09,990
Whose watch is the most accurate?

37
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,557
Even the most accurate watch
in the world can be off.

38
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:18,426
If the error is less than a minute,
people can't say you're late, right?

39
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:21,627
Brother Man, sometimes you don't
need to be so serious.

40
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:27,222
I don't agree. A minute is a minute.
Don't belittle these 60 seconds.

41
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:29,190
Listen. Lots of things are decided
within a matter of seconds.

42
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:32,043
Even a second can decide
the latter half of a person's life.

43
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,785
I'm different from you.
You like crossing the line.

44
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,323
I can say you're just lucky
you never get into trouble.

45
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:42,142
I won't take any risks, OK?

46
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:46,435
We're just going for a drink.
You don't need to debate it so seriously.

47
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:49,631
If you want to debate,
do it when we're drinking tonight, OK?

48
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:50,322
That's right.

49
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:51,754
I know you guys care about me.

50
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:55,764
Will deal with my problem with Ka-ka
in due course. Thank you.

51
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,785
Hey, it's six o'clock sharp. Bye.

52
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:02,192
Remember the beef hotpot with Ho-ho
and Hang-hang tomorrow night.

53
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:03,512
Bye.

54
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:04,402
Bye.

55
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,114
Good morning.

56
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:12,269
You came in so early?

57
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,602
First, I need to meet some inmates.

58
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:17,279
Secondly, I wanted to tell you that
even though I went out drinking last night,

59
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:20,864
I still came in on time this morning.
I even feel really sharp.

60
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,842
Why do you guys keep bothering me?

61
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:25,909
We care about you and Ka-ka...

62
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:30,074
OK. Got it. But we're at work.
Don't talk about personal matters, OK?

63
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:34,198
So the review board
is reviewing the inmates again.

64
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,276
This sentence review system is
quite good.

65
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:41,143
It gives those who are truly repentant
a chance to turn a new leaf.

66
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:44,605
I agree. Have the inmates said anything
to your welfare unit recently?

67
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:49,153
It's Yip Sai-heung again.
He keeps asking me for medical parole.

68
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:52,067
I have to tell him time and again that
there's no such thing.

69
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:55,064
You know how wicked this guy is.

70
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,839
Neither the Security Bureau
nor the Commissioner will

71
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:59,713
approve his early release.

72
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:01,353
There must be a reason for that.

73
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,960
I told you he's evil by nature.

74
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,600
If he had a tinge of kindness,

75
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:08,687
I'm afraid he won't show it
until the last minute of his life.

76
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,113
But he seems to have changed recently.

77
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:14,065
Scholar told me that he's been reading
Buddhist scriptures.

78
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:15,837
He'll ask Scholar to explain to him
the words he doesn't understand.

79
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,356
Control calling Man Sir.
Inmates in BB ward are fighting.

80
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:26,041
BB ward? If it's Yip Sai-heung again,
he's really changed. Get down to business.

81
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:30,549
Hey, get up.

82
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:43,989
Stop fighting.

83
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,710
At first we thought he hit Puny.
Actually Wing did.

84
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:58,037
Puny sat on his radio by accident
and broke it. He got mad and hit Puny.

85
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,677
I don't understand why
Yip Sai-heung would save Puny.

86
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:01,706
Let me ask him.

87
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,147
Yip Sai-heung, how are you?

88
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:19,034
Still alive.

89
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:22,122
Why did you save Puny?
Didn't you want him dead?

90
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,481
I'm just concerned about your condition
since you're sick.

91
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,627
Why did you take the risk?

92
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:31,504
I got a letter from my wife.
She's eloped with another guy.

93
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:35,321
I'm sick. But I'm not afraid of that.

94
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:40,230
I have to spend the rest of my life here.
But I didn't feel like my life is over.

95
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:47,507
But my wife...She's everything to me.

96
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,398
You have to spend
the rest of your life here.

97
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,757
That means I'll be like a widow
for the rest of my life.

98
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:55,038
It's such a long time.
How can I endure that?

99
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:57,391
I breaks my heart to see you like this.

100
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:03,551
She's been my support all along.
Now she...

101
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:08,861
If this had happened in the past,
I'd ask my underlings to beat someone up

102
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:10,316
to vent my anger.

103
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,069
But what's the use of venting my anger?
Will my wife come back?

104
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:21,321
We've been married for years.
I know her temperament well.

105
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:24,120
Once she's left, she will never come back.

106
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,193
Now I understand what it means
to lose everything.

107
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:46,142
Like Ho Wan said, this is karma.
This is karma.

108
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:56,267
I've read the letter to Yip Sai-heung.
His wife has really left.

109
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,832
He's been reading
Buddhist scriptures lately.

110
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,866
I think Ho Wan has inﬂuenced him.

111
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,985
Wow, Yip Sai-heung
has become a Buddhist?

112
00:09:04,063 --> 00:09:04,985
That's really incredible.

113
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,682
He often says this is karma for him.
There have been similar cases before.

114
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:16,118
Take Ho Wan for example.
A tragedy happened in his family.

115
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,425
So his temperament changed completely.

116
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:21,636
I think Yip Sai-heung is showing
a similar tendency now.

117
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:25,392
When a person encounters
an extremely frustrating event,

118
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:28,321
he will think about his life.

119
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,320
I think he's been enlightened.

120
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:36,429
You two are too optimistic.
He will never change.

121
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:40,993
I know people like Yip Sai-heung too well.
How could he change so easily?

122
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,430
I don't agree.
I've worked in CSD for so long.

123
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,832
I've heard of similar cases
even though I've never really seen one.

124
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:49,066
Nothing in the world is absolute.
I believe a person can change.

125
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,599
I've worked in CSD for so many years.

126
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:53,551
That's why I can smell when
something doesn't tally.

127
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:56,790
I don't believe Yip Sai-heung would change.

128
00:09:56,905 --> 00:10:00,500
Brother Man,
don't you just look at evidence?

129
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:02,353
Now you're saying you can smell it?

130
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,706
Of course evidence is important.

131
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,785
But sometimes intuition
is really important too.

132
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:06,988
Some experts have done studies.

133
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,965
The intuition of a seasoned professional

134
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:12,502
is very close to the sensitivity
of his professional judgment.

135
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:14,318
I really can't argue with you.

136
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,314
Has it ever crossed your mind that
you're prejudiced against Yip Sai-heung?

137
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:18,753
You think I'm that kind of person?

138
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,193
You almost died in the previous incidents.

139
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:25,313
It's true that there wasn't any evidence
to tie him to them.

140
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:29,347
But everyone thinks he did it.
Don't you hate him?

141
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,678
If I were you, I would be
somewhat prejudiced against him.

142
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:37,070
Do you really think of me like that?
And we've been friends for so many years?

143
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,221
The bread's been delivered.
But I haven't put it on the shelf yet.

144
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:54,470
It's OK. Just go.

145
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,343
You're going to dinner with your son.
Enjoy.

146
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:00,394
OK. Thank you very much then.

147
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:03,599
Ho, you have to help me.

148
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:06,837
What's the matter? Come over here.

149
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:11,069
I wanted to see you a while ago.
They made me traffic drugs.

150
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,595
I'm so scared.
I really don't want to do it again.

151
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:19,911
But they beat me up and threatened me.
I really don't know what to do now.

152
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:22,467
Take someone over there and look for her.

153
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:23,598
You two come with me.

154
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:33,906
I know the one in back. He's CSD.
He and that woman often harass Angel.

155
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:35,424
I know one of them too.

156
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:39,064
When I was in Stanley Prison,
he wrote an adverse report on me.

157
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,147
He wouldn't let me go to my dad's funeral.

158
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:42,066
Please do something to help me.

159
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:42,856
Ho-ho, what's the matter?

160
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,312
Someone's forcing her to traffic drugs.
Hey, don't go.

161
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,311
You came to see me because you want to
live like a normal person.

162
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,627
Turn yourself in and quit drugs.

163
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,759
I can't. I can't go to jail.

164
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:55,115
I've been there before.
Don't think jail is like hell.

165
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,426
Jail is a place where you can
reflect on yourself quietly.

166
00:11:58,496 --> 00:11:59,782
Go there and do some soul searching.

167
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:01,826
Then you can turn a new leaf
when you're released.

168
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:03,863
Coco, don't be scared.

169
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:05,904
Ho-ho will help you.
Well support you too.

170
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:08,138
You've done something illegal.

171
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:09,216
Even if you did it under duress,

172
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:11,196
the consequence will still be the same
if you're arrested.

173
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:12,312
You'll still go to jail.

174
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,265
Testify against those bad guys now.
It'll be better than just leaving.

175
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:18,751
We'll all help you. Don't be scared.

176
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:21,951
That darn cripple.

177
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:25,263
Last time our joint was raided.
Did she tip off the police?

178
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,626
So they know each other.

179
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:28,835
Brother Kwan, something's wrong.

180
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:32,346
Coco appears to be listening to them.
What if she rats on us?

181
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:34,912
Let's get out of here.

182
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,596
Coco, why are you still hesitating?

183
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,423
The chance is right here.
Don't make a mistake again.

184
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,864
Sorry Madam Chi.

185
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,311
You came here just
because I needed to give a statement.

186
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:51,262
No problem. The police just asked you
to assist in their investigation.

187
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:54,057
You're discharging your duty as a citizen.
Don't feel like you owe me one.

188
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:57,911
I think I'll be seeing less of
Man Sir and Yung Sir in future,

189
00:12:57,981 --> 00:13:01,030
because I keep running into
my old friends.

190
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:02,867
I don't want to give them trouble.

191
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,391
You're doing good deeds as a good person.

192
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:08,672
You think you're doing bad things
and giving people trouble? You're so wrong.

193
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:11,192
You were amazing just now
when you were trying to convince Coco.

194
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:12,990
You were so persuasive. I can't be
as persuasive as you.

195
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,948
You mean I went to jail before
so what I say is more convincing?

196
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:19,391
Ho, actually you just lack confidence.

197
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:21,953
We've already asked you to come to
our private gatherings.

198
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,859
But it seems you still
label yourself as bad. Don't you think so?

199
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:29,709
I know you care about peoples feelings.
That's why you think of yourself this way.

200
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,554
But you really don't need to do that.

201
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:34,785
I feel bad seeing you've
given yourself so much pressure.

202
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,597
Thank you very much, Madam Chi.
I'm so grateful to you.

203
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:40,137
Hearing you say that means I can do better.

204
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:43,319
You can be happier.

205
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:46,192
Take what happened today for example.
I want to give you ten likes.

206
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:47,591
Thank you, Madam Chi.

207
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,222
Thank you, Madam Chi.

208
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:50,344
Did I compliment you?

209
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:55,184
But you do have good taste
for choosing such a good girlfriend.

210
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:58,751
I'm a quality product too.
That's why she chose me.

211
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:01,145
Product?
You think you're buying fruits?

212
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:05,342
If I were a fruit, I'd be a durian.

213
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:08,387
Rough outside but good inside. Eat me.

214
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:10,955
Let's go, durian.

215
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,982
You're a peach.
You're beautiful both outside and inside.

216
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,857
According to you,
Ho-ho has really changed completely.

217
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,190
I'm happy for Q.
I'm happy for you too.

218
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,671
You had a hand in correcting Ho-ho too.

219
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:27,906
As Wu Sir in STI said,
when we've corrected an inmate...

220
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,466
We don't just correct her...

221
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,145
We may have saved a family...

222
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:33,112
Or those around her.

223
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:38,958
Ho and Q make a nice pair.
What about you and Man Sir?

224
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:44,037
Why bring that up? We're working now.

225
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,546
Let's talk about work.
Don't talk about our personal matters.

226
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:50,833
You're really so different now.
You have the air of a madam all the more.

227
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,669
You've really gained experience.

228
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:58,553
I feel like a re-formatted computer.
Now I look at the world from a new angle.

229
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,957
At the same time, my capacity is bigger
so I can download more programs.

230
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:03,219
I don't get it.

231
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,629
In the past, when I had free time,
I would go out and play. But now I read.

232
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:10,906
Because reading helps me
understand the world better.

233
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:14,593
So you've completely changed too like Ho-ho.

234
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:17,825
Actually why did you come here today?

235
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:20,468
Oh, Killer Whale's being released
in 6 months.

236
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:23,911
So I came to talk to her about her
housing arrangements when she gets out.

237
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,148
OK.

238
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:29,311
She may be getting out soon,
but I don't think she's repented yet.

239
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:33,959
Wu Sir said before that putting an inmate
in jail is for the peace of society.

240
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:36,979
Then what about releasing someone
who hasn't repented yet?

241
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,213
Wu Sir didn't touch on that.

242
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:43,035
Madam Yiu, we've collected all the books.

243
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:45,389
Put them back on the shelves
according to their classification.

244
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:46,704
Yes. OK

245
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:50,907
Madam Yiu, shall I put this
Monte Christ in the Religion Section?

246
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:52,304
It's Monte Cristo.

247
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,064
Le Comte de Monte Cristo is a novel.
It goes under Literature.

248
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:56,342
Sorry. My mistake.

249
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:57,861
That's a good book.
Borrow it next time.

250
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:58,956
Thank you.

251
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:02,057
The main character of the novel
broke out of prison.

252
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:04,341
Aren't you afraid they'll copy him?

253
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:09,913
Do you have anything on tonight?
I'll buy you dinner.

254
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:10,780
So nice?

255
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:11,958
Are you coming?

256
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:12,955
OK.

257
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:14,674
OK. I'll call you when I'm off.

258
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,394
OK.

259
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:26,473
When your number is called,
come out and get your book. 391092.

260
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:28,669
I thought someone had to find a new job.

261
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:30,425
382126.

262
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:33,419
She's done so many wicked things.
But she's back unscathed.

263
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:34,989
302394, 345675.

264
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,503
Isn't she afraid that
there's a ghost in the cell?

265
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:37,703
You got me killed.

266
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,701
I'm so scared.

267
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:39,757
I want you to die and keep me company.

268
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:40,982
Killer Whale, what are you talking about?

269
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:45,061
Madam, my breath will stink if I don't talk.
Am I not allowed to talk?

270
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,856
369249.

271
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,470
Ouch. Why did you trip me?

272
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,624
You didn't watch your step.
You tripped me.

273
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:55,142
You'll have no children, darn woman.

274
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:56,112
What did you say?

275
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,980
What did I say? I'm not afraid of you.

276
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:03,035
Stop it or I'll use pepper spray.

277
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:06,468
Madam, I need a doctor. I'm hurt.

278
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,499
OK. Thank you.

279
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:14,777
Killer Whale is hopeless.

280
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,498
She's asking the other inmates to give her
cigarettes again as a protection fee.

281
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:21,271
The inmates say Pui-hung won't give in.
So she often stirs trouble with Pui-hung.

282
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:22,552
She's doing it again?

283
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,828
It won't help to catch Killer Whale again.

284
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,904
She's prepared to stay here
for the full term.

285
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:29,779
She's not afraid of forfeiting remission.

286
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:32,495
Even though she'll be released,
she'll come back in very soon.

287
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:36,671
Not necessarily. I fell before.
But I could still stand back up.

288
00:17:36,743 --> 00:17:38,029
Nothing's absolute.

289
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:42,109
Tam Yuet-king is the most difficult inmate
we've come across in recent years.

290
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,059
She has no respect for discipline at all.
She keeps breaching the rules.

291
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,341
A lot of colleagues have lost hope in her.

292
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:52,507
I'm glad that you still have
such a positive view of her.

293
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:55,700
I feel that no matter how bad she is,
there's still hope.

294
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:56,595
Do you have the confidence

295
00:17:56,698 --> 00:17:59,497
to make her reflect on herself
before she's released?

296
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:01,587
Madam, I'm ready and willing to try.

297
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:04,337
Good. Keep me posted of the progress.

298
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:06,748
Yes, madam. I'll get back to work.

299
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,215
Tam Yuet-king.

300
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:20,988
Have some tea please.

301
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:22,112
Thank you.

302
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:27,187
Angel, the boss said your recent
performance has improved a lot.

303
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:32,863
Those guys haven't come to see you anymore?
Are you OK?

304
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:36,425
I broke up with Kuen.

305
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:37,465
Really?

306
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:41,906
He sells ketamine and traffics drugs.

307
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:44,620
My best friend died
because she took ketamine.

308
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,471
I told him that he could do anything.
But he must never sell drugs.

309
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:51,591
He didn't listen to me. So I ditched him.

310
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:55,270
Angel, it's good that you know
drugs aren't legal.

311
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:58,417
But actually you shouldn't do
anything illegal.

312
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:02,499
I know.
I mean I hate pushers most.

313
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,391
Actually the supervision order

314
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:08,900
isn't just about observing the curfew
and doing your job well.

315
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:12,422
Its objective is to help you
correct yourself and turn a new leaf.

316
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,950
As long as you really want to
do the right thing,

317
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:17,180
you'll still have a bright future.

318
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,306
I understand.

319
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:23,908
Madam Chi, dinner service is about to start.
I need to get ready.

320
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:25,671
OK. Work hard then.

321
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:26,595
OK.

322
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:36,316
I thought you were so nice to ask me here.
But it's because you have work here,

323
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:37,984
and it's convenient.
That's why you want to eat here.

324
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:39,387
Don't say that.

325
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:44,988
I just have a tight schedule for work
and personal arrangements.

326
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:49,115
But I'm off now.
We don't need to talk about work.

327
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:51,503
OK. Let me see what to order.

328
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:52,953
Voice call. Don.

329
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:01,626
Let's have all-you-can-eat. It's a bargain.

330
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:02,596
Really?

331
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:09,347
Voice call. Don.

332
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,756
OK. Let's not talk about work.
Let's talk about personal life.

333
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:15,495
You phone keeps ringing.
Why won't you answer it?

334
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:19,700
Nothing. They're just cold calls.

335
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:22,904
You're really bad at lying.

336
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:26,587
I don't want to answer someone's calls.

337
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:29,908
Tell me everything please.
I don't want to guess.

338
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:30,852
It's Yung Sir.

339
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:32,955
You two have quietly started a revolution?

340
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,594
I don't know if that's the case.

341
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:39,831
Actually we almost started.
But before that...

342
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,822
You two quarreled?

343
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:46,064
No. I lost faith in him
before we even started.

344
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:50,627
I had a crush on him first.

345
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:54,827
But then when he found out,
he kept asking me to give him a chance.

346
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:58,618
So I agreed to spend some time
observing him.

347
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:01,346
Miss Chi, I really can't believe this.

348
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:04,137
Brother Don is so nice.
Why are you still hesitating?

349
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:07,466
I don't like his stubborn attitude
towards his dad.

350
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,777
He has no patience at all for his dad.

351
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:12,311
But he's so patient
when he deals with the inmates.

352
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:15,829
Also, he cares a lot about other women.

353
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,314
I don't get it.

354
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:22,422
OK. I'll tell you everything.
He says he doesn't approve of Ally.

355
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:25,782
But whenever Ally's in trouble,
he'll immediately go help her.

356
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:27,776
You're already so jealous
even before you two have begun.

357
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:29,027
Just now you said he kept asking you
to give him a chance.

358
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:30,465
If he didn't like you, why would he do that?

359
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:32,059
How would you understand?

360
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:35,830
He said he likes me.
That puts me under a lot of pressure.

361
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:39,945
Today there's Ally.
Maybe there'll be someone else tomorrow.

362
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,034
It appears you're being overly sensitive.
Brother Don has done nothing wrong.

363
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:51,754
But we come from two different worlds.
I admit I feel inferior.

364
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:57,212
But think about it. He likes fine dining.
I just go to cafes.

365
00:21:57,305 --> 00:22:02,311
He wears designer outfits and cologne.
I just bought this shirt from an outlet.

366
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:05,419
What you said just now is so superficial.

367
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:07,312
Don't be so shallow.

368
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,541
When two people are with each other,

369
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:10,189
it's communication and sharing that counts.

370
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:14,675
Compromise on what you like to eat
or wear when you're together.

371
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:17,745
You're stopping even before you've started.
You wont be happy in the future.

372
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,902
But I really feel like I'm not his match.

373
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:24,220
You're free to think that.
But don't keep it to yourself.

374
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:26,542
You have to tell him about it.
Only then is it fair to him.

375
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:31,830
Actually you feel inferior because
you think he might spurn you.

376
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:36,033
Tell him everything right from the outset
and show him who you really are.

377
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:39,217
If he really doesn't like you for that,
then he doesn't deserve your love.

378
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,749
Answer it.
I'll pretend I can't hear it.

379
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:55,184
Hello.

380
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:06,963
You're home?

381
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,436
Sweetheart, dinner's ready.

382
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,600
Come on. The food's getting cold.

383
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,686
Come on. Let's start eating.

384
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,600
Dad, Mom.
This is my colleague Yung Wai-chun.

385
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,787
Uncle, Auntie, how do you do.

386
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:19,080
Sweetheart, you should have told us
you're coming home with your friend.

387
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:21,921
Hey, go in and get changed. Sorry.

388
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,711
It's OK.

389
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:23,917
We need to.

390
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:31,124
I brought you here
because I want to show you my home.

391
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,765
You took me home before.

392
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,225
I didn't dare get out of your car
outside my building

393
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,002
because I was afraid
you'd find out too much about me.

394
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:45,153
I've lived here for over 20 years.
It's a mess, isn't it?

395
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,359
My dad likes collecting
newspapers and magazines.

396
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,869
All the furniture here is second-hand.
Take this chair for example.

397
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:55,349
My friend didn't want it.
So she gave it to me.

398
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:58,322
My dad and mom didn't go to school.

399
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:01,715
Dad suffers from chronic renal disease.
He needs dialysis every day.

400
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:06,714
Mom hasn't worked in years.
So the three of us live on my income.

401
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:11,681
The food we eat has to be cheap.
And it has to be filling.

402
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,152
We have no requirements at all
about our clothes.

403
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:19,356
When I go to dinner with you guys.
I sometimes feel pressure,

404
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:21,197
but I need to make friends.

405
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:27,073
You may find my home a disgrace.
But all three of us are good citizens.

406
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:30,043
Let me finish first.

407
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:34,681
I want to tell you that
if we're really together,

408
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:38,553
I won't covet your money.
We'll go Dutch when we go out.

409
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:43,226
But if there's a formal occasion, I'm sorry.

410
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,717
I may not be able to go with you
because I don't have any nice clothes.

411
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,634
This ﬂat may be worn,

412
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:57,635
but I believe there's a stow
behind every item here.

413
00:24:58,068 --> 00:24:59,843
You really cherish them too.

414
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,480
Just now when I came in,
I felt the warmth of your family.

415
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:08,320
That's something I don't have.

416
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:12,326
You said the food you guys eat
is very simple

417
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:17,077
and the clothes you wear are cheap.
I don't see a problem there.

418
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,876
A person's character is the most important.

419
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:24,069
You may wear designer clothes
and drive a nice car,

420
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,685
but if you heart is wicked,
I won't think you're noble at all.

421
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:29,921
So I don't think you have a problem.

422
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:36,791
You mean you don't mind the fact that
I'm no match for you?

423
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,123
If you think that again,
I really will mind.

424
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,127
Mom.

425
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:46,126
What?

426
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:49,319
We won a can of abalone
in the lucky draw earlier.

427
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:50,839
Can we eat it tonight?

428
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:53,070
Sure.

429
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:56,558
Wait. If it's so formal that
you have to treat me to abalone,

430
00:25:56,677 --> 00:26:01,433
I want to know what our rating
is now. I mean from 1 to 10.

431
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:07,046
Well...5.

432
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:11,120
5 plus 5 equals 10, right?

433
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:17,708
You wish...
Dad, why are you wearing a suit?

434
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:18,865
We have a guest.

435
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:21,995
Your friend's here.
Mr Yung, please join us for dinner.

436
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:22,987
Right.

437
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:24,625
I'll get you a bowl
and a pair of chopsticks.

438
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:25,345
OK. Thank you very much.

439
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,703
Mr Yung, have a seat please.
I'll get you a chair.

440
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:27,560
I'll get it.

441
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:28,277
You sit down too.

442
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:39,232
Donald, you've never taken the initiative
to ask me to tea.

443
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:43,397
I can't believe that as soon as you do,
you introduce me to your girlfriend.

444
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,317
You've shown respect for your dad.

445
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:50,599
Excuse me. I don't remember your name.
You're called...?

446
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:53,226
Chi Chun-kwong.
Uncle, please call me Kwong.

447
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:58,767
Chun-kwong. Your name is really special.
I'll remember it.

448
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:02,709
Actually it wasn't my idea
to ask you to come out today.

449
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:04,432
It was Kwong's idea.

450
00:27:04,552 --> 00:27:10,787
Really? That's good.
At least you still remember this place.

451
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:13,269
You asked me to come here.

452
00:27:13,862 --> 00:27:18,641
When you were a kid,
we came here every week.

453
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:22,153
Your favorite food was
the baked tapioca custard.

454
00:27:22,318 --> 00:27:24,912
Actually it was also Kwong's idea
to come here.

455
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:29,710
She read your autobiography.
She said you often mention this cafe.

456
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:33,998
She also said that you talk about me
all the time in your book.

457
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:35,711
She's jotted it down.

458
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,153
She said you mention the words "my son"
63 times,

459
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:43,202
"my son Wai-chun" 78 times.

460
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:46,354
There are 428 pages only in your book.

461
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:51,399
I realized how important I am to you.

462
00:27:51,957 --> 00:27:58,272
Today I want to tell you that
I refused to see you all along

463
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:06,000
partly because of Candy, you and me.
I don't want people to talk about us anymore

464
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:09,196
Most important of all,
I'm different from you.

465
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:18,428
You may want fame and fortune.
What we want is really simple.

466
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:21,394
We want to train the detainees well

467
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:26,509
so when they're released,
they won't harm society again.

468
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:28,964
As long as we can train a detainee well,

469
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:31,682
there's one person less
who will jeopardize our society.

470
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:35,201
This is the difference between you and me.

471
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:49,863
Guys, a Buddhist master is giving a lecture
on Buddhist scriptures later.

472
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:52,195
Raise your hand if you're interested.

473
00:28:58,145 --> 00:29:00,716
If you want to become a Buddhist,
you should go.

474
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:22,197
The topic I'm going to
talk about today is "Fate".

475
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:27,354
You may have all
asked yourselves this question...

476
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,433
I can't believe Yip Sai-heung
would be so attentive.

477
00:29:31,862 --> 00:29:34,604
I think his appearance has changed
since he converted to Buddhism.

478
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,710
He doesn't look as fierce as before.
He looks more human now.

479
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:39,640
One looks the way one thinks.

480
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:45,324
Some people work hard their whole life.
They may do something extreme.

481
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,687
From the perspective of Buddhism,

482
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:55,600
everything is the karma of
a person's good or evil deeds, because...

483
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:56,957
Sorry, master. I need to interrupt you.

484
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:57,478
OK.

485
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:00,429
Yip Sai-heung, you passed a slip.
You want to make trouble?

486
00:30:00,503 --> 00:30:04,224
Man Sir, what trouble have I made?

487
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:05,348
On the floor.

488
00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:13,122
Stop killing and become Buddha.

489
00:30:13,957 --> 00:30:25,278
Man Sir, I just wanted to share this saying
with everyone. Is that a sin?

490
00:30:25,471 --> 00:30:30,511
This phrase appears to be innocuous.
But it could be some kind of code.

491
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:34,358
Also, it's against the rule
to pass anything around.

492
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:36,077
So you've breached the rules.

493
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:43,120
Since you've done something wrong,
you should apologize to this officer.

494
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:50,196
The conflicts between human beings
can be solved with forgiveness.

495
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:50,838
A person's fate...

496
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:52,115
I'm sorry, master.

497
00:30:55,504 --> 00:31:02,399
Man Sir, it's true that
I really hated you before.

498
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:06,784
I wanted you dead. So I kept picking on you.

499
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:12,267
That's why your prejudice against
me deepened.

500
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:16,430
But Master Yeuk Hung is really right.

501
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:21,716
The more you hate a person,
the more sinful you become.

502
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:27,351
The more you can’t let it go,
the more you'll suffer.

503
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:34,429
Seriously, I'm really exhausted.
I don't want to fight anymore.

504
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:50,632
Man Sir, I'm sorry. This is my fault.
Please give me a chance.

505
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:56,756
It's good that you've apologized.

506
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,908
I hope you will remember
what you said today.

507
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,222
Don't forget everything
when you wake up tomorrow

508
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,915
and go back to square one.

509
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:06,477
Sorry for interrupting you, master.

510
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:10,599
Actually, master was right.

511
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:14,145
Interpersonal conﬂicts
can be solved through forgiveness.

512
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,124
Yip Sai-heung already apologized.

513
00:32:16,315 --> 00:32:18,989
Did Man Sir have to stand so firm
over just a hand shake?

514
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:19,919
Could it be that

515
00:32:19,986 --> 00:32:22,865
Man Sir was thinking about his image,
that's why he didn't shake hands with him?

516
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:26,679
But I've known him for so long.
He's not that kind of person.

517
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,116
Why make it so complicated?

518
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:31,326
Man Sir never makes any allowance.
This is his style.

519
00:32:31,987 --> 00:32:37,039
Give you some allowance? No way.
Please follow the rules strictly.

520
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:38,349
Don't say that.

521
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,315
You're not in Man Sir's shoes.
How would you know his difficulties?

522
00:32:41,424 --> 00:32:42,869
He must have a reason for what he did.

523
00:32:42,955 --> 00:32:45,242
Maybe he thinks that
if we don't stand firm,

524
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:49,429
the other inmates will think it's OK
to make mistakes if they apologize. Right?

525
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:52,962
Wai, you're relatively new here.
I've worked under other team leaders before.

526
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:55,042
They all said Man Sir's strict.

527
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:57,761
Did you notice that Yip Sai-heung
usually makes trouble in the Left Division?

528
00:32:57,832 --> 00:32:59,914
He seldom does so in the Right Division.
Do you know why?

529
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:00,862
Why?

530
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,114
It's because he picks on Man Sir.

531
00:33:03,627 --> 00:33:05,959
You mean if Man Sir weren't so strict,

532
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:07,429
there might not be so many people
working against him?

533
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,198
Yes.

534
00:33:08,313 --> 00:33:11,601
But if he's too lenient,
Yip Sai-heung would push his luck.

535
00:33:11,985 --> 00:33:15,956
Is it because Yip Sai-heung was unruly first
or because Man Sir was too strict first?

536
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:18,473
Guys. Stop discussing this.

537
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:20,790
It won't be good if Man Sir
hears this when he comes back.

538
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,230
OK. Yes, sir.

539
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,316
Yes, sir...

540
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:23,962
Sorry, sir.

541
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:24,793
Bye.

542
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:28,757
Chiu, come in my office.

543
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:29,510
OK.

544
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:48,280
Sit down. You've worked under me the longest

545
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:49,592
I want to hear what you think.

546
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:52,362
Do you think I should have shaken hands
with Yip Sai-heung just now?

547
00:33:52,392 --> 00:33:54,872
I think you should have.
There was no harm in doing so.

548
00:33:55,351 --> 00:33:57,547
First, it would send
a positive message to the other inmates.

549
00:33:57,663 --> 00:34:01,031
They would see that if they truly repented
and really behaved,

550
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:02,877
there'd still be a chance and hope.

551
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,074
Secondly, it can also encourages
the colleagues.

552
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,643
They'll think you're compassionate.
That's a way to boost morale.

553
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,951
I understand what's on your mind.

554
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:14,744
The problem is I don't believe that
Yip Sai-heung would change for the better.

555
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,824
But it's a fact that he saved Puny.

556
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,641
He often reads books on Buddhism
and chants the Buddhist scriptures.

557
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:23,394
We all think he's changed.

558
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:26,591
He's not as violent as he used to be.
He looks a lot more benevolent now.

559
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:31,543
Benevolent? He's not benevolent. He's sick.
So he looks pale and less belligerent.

560
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:34,306
That's why he can’t talk as loudly.

561
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:38,080
If you're talking about benevolence,
Scholar is really benevolent.

562
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:42,310
It would be too strict
to compare him to Scholar.

563
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:44,436
Scholar has been here for almost 30 years.

564
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:47,028
Yip Sai-heung came here
only two years ago.

565
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:51,922
Sometimes when I work under you,
I feel the pressure too.

566
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:55,822
It's hard to strike a balance
in everything we do.

567
00:34:56,228 --> 00:35:00,278
Regardless, I trust your experience and I
will follow your way in handling things.

568
00:35:00,352 --> 00:35:03,822
Actually you don't need to strike a balance
all the time when you talk to me.

569
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,946
I want to hear your honest opinion.

570
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:09,792
Why don't you tell me if
I give you guys a lot of pressure?

571
00:35:09,913 --> 00:35:12,519
If what I say is said
on behalf of the colleagues,

572
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:15,829
then I can't tell a lie
because I have to represent them.

573
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:21,030
Yes. Sometimes it's a bit tough
working under you.

574
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:24,665
If there's nothing further,
I'll get back to work.

575
00:35:37,742 --> 00:35:39,073
I've worked under other team leaders before.

576
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,284
They all said Man Sir's strict.

577
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:43,636
You mean if Man Sir wasn't so strict,

578
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,315
there might not be so many people
working against him?

579
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,874
Yes. Sometimes it's a bit tough
working under you.

580
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:56,920
Even the most accurate watch
in the world can be off.

581
00:35:57,022 --> 00:36:01,471
If the error is less than a minute,
people can't say you're late, right?

582
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:04,822
Brother Man, sometimes you don't
need to be so serious.

583
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:07,516
Human beings aren't robots.

584
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:11,181
Same for romance.
There are no manuals or rules to follow.

585
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:01,992
What a coincidence?

586
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:06,505
Right. I just came out for a walk.

587
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:08,068
Join me for a drink?

588
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:09,950
OK.

589
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:14,435
Hi.

590
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:15,465
Hi.

591
00:37:15,538 --> 00:37:17,563
Joe is a neighbor in Stanley.
He really likes to travel like me.

592
00:37:17,663 --> 00:37:19,791
He even writes travel books.
He's amazing.

593
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:23,754
Really? When did you meet
such an interesting neighbor?

594
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:24,947
Just now when I was jogging.

595
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,186
We're neighbors.
We must meet more often from now on.

596
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:29,351
When are you going on holiday?
I can give you some advice.

597
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:30,391
Great.

598
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,436
Hey, I see a friend.
I have to go say hello.

599
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:39,995
You make friends with strangers
on the street.

600
00:37:40,101 --> 00:37:42,183
You're even having drinks with him.
Aren't you afraid hes a bad guy?

601
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:45,957
He's a neighbor. It's daytime now.
What can happen?

602
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:46,742
If I thought it was dangerous,

603
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,312
I wouldn't have sat down
for a drink with him.

604
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:51,637
I'm afraid your judgment is wrong.
Have you forgotten what happened with Fei?

605
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:54,073
I've learned a lesson.

606
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,875
You think I should refrain from
making new friends?

607
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,277
I'm just worried about you.
You get close to people so easily.

608
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:00,031
You may want to go on an adventure
with him again.

609
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:03,390
You know when you're in the mood,
you drink a lot.

610
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:05,437
I'm afraid something bad
might happen to you.

611
00:38:09,304 --> 00:38:13,275
I was really right. You never change.

612
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:19,181
Just now I tried very hard
to understand your point.

613
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:22,312
In the past when you didn't like
me doing something,

614
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:25,796
I would smile at you in a silly way
and say something cute to pacify you.

615
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:29,027
Then I would run away in a jolly manner
as if nothing had happened.

616
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:34,469
So we never quarreled.
That's because of our seniority.

617
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:36,280
You were always right
and I was always wrong.

618
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:42,582
But it's different now. I'm a big girl now.
I'm no longer the Ka-ka from before.

619
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:47,950
I went out with you. Then we broke up.
We've been through a lot, right?

620
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:50,231
I'm more mature now.

621
00:38:50,272 --> 00:38:53,151
I know a mature person should communicate
with others in a fair manner.

622
00:38:54,554 --> 00:39:01,233
Just now you kept challenging me.
From my perspective, you were so rude.

623
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:06,388
Perhaps you don't know how to
respect others. Do you understand that?

624
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:16,745
I always thought I was clear-minded.
Actually I have so many blind spots.

625
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:21,996
I'm inﬂexible. I give people pressure.
I stress out my colleagues. I'm so disliked.

626
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:36,428
I'm not welcome.
Now...You two carry on. I have to go.

627
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,871
Hey, your friends leaving so soon?

628
00:39:43,538 --> 00:39:45,666
He said he has something to do.

629
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:47,111
OK.

630
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:54,951
It seems like the rain's getting heavier.

631
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,796
I better go home and get an umbrella.
Wait for me here, OK?

632
00:39:57,864 --> 00:39:58,387
OK.

633
00:39:58,426 --> 00:39:59,382
You look after Hang-hang.

634
00:40:08,382 --> 00:40:09,543
Hey, what are you guys doing?

635
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:10,360
Take your hands off. Go.

636
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:10,826
Go.

637
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:12,868
Why are you taking us? What's going on?

638
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:13,458
Go.

639
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,275
Shut up.

640
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:14,873
Hang-hang.

641
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:16,308
Shut up.

642
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,917
Your call cannot be connected right now.
Please call again later.

643
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:32,830
What's the matter? What are you guys doing?
What do you want?

644
00:40:32,945 --> 00:40:39,635
Hush...So you told Coco to tell on us?

645
00:40:39,943 --> 00:40:45,871
Do you know you don't quit drugs.
You take them.

646
00:40:46,426 --> 00:40:47,234
Kid...Kid.

647
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:49,110
Big Brother, the kid can't hang in there.

648
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:50,272
Hang-hang.

649
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:51,589
Shoot him up with drugs.

650
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:54,108
Don't do it please.
You can do anything to me.

651
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:56,796
Please leave Hang-hang alone.
I beg you please.

652
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:00,997
Well? I'll run the car
over your other leg then.

653
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:04,107
No. Don't do that. Ah...

654
00:41:22,505 --> 00:41:23,540
Are you really scared?

655
00:41:24,505 --> 00:41:28,715
I wont inject your son with drugs.
I wont break your other leg.

656
00:41:29,223 --> 00:41:30,304
But you must cooperate with me.

657
00:41:39,271 --> 00:41:42,104
Ho-ho, why did you ask me
to come out so urgently?

658
00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:49,662
Why can't I tell Q?
Ho-ho, are you OK?

659
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:51,639
Why did I help Coco?

660
00:41:52,817 --> 00:41:55,149
If I hadn't helped her,
this wouldn't have happened.

661
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:59,748
I'm really so stupid. So stupid.

662
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,311
Ho-ho, don't leave.
Tell me what's going on, OK?

663
00:42:03,427 --> 00:42:05,543
Don't follow me. Go away.

664
00:42:14,021 --> 00:42:18,185
I wont inject your son with drugs.
I wont break your other leg.

665
00:42:18,551 --> 00:42:23,671
Cooperate with me. Take this
and shoot it into Man Sheung-shing.

666
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:24,717
What does he have to do with this?

667
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:29,277
Just do it. After you've done it,
I'll give your son back to you.

668
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,349
Otherwise you can prepare
a body bag for him.
