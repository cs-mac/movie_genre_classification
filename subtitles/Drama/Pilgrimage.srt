00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,830
1209 DC

3
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,020
NOW Christianity dominated Europe.

4
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,040
BY FAITH, they are launched crusades to recapture Jerusalem.

5
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,940
IRELAND IS FAR FROM HOLY LAND.

6
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,780
NORMAN INVADERS loyalists King John of England.

7
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,440
FIGHT TO CONQUER THE ISLAND IN GAELIC.

8
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,150
A DISTANT MONASTERY PROTEGE an ancient relic.

9
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,290
KILMANNAN WEST COAST OF IRELAND.

10
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,920
Dammit!

11
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,770
What do you think he was thinking the first man who ate this?

12
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,180
Brother Cathal said they have no soul ...

13
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:24,030
Animals on earth to clothe and feed.

14
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,420
Every creature that does not serve us is our enemy.

15
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,270
How would you know the man who serves creature?

16
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,570
Was it funny? Desperate? Did God put the idea in your head?

17
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,430
Gentlemen.

18
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,200
Gentlemen.

19
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,430
- Gentlemen! - How many?

20
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,770
- Three. - Did you see the colors?

21
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,080
- Do you know what clan they are? - Abad, are warriors with them.

22
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,210
- The relic was moved? - Of course not, Abad.

23
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,650
Then we will continue with our duties as usual.

24
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,450
But Abad ....

25
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,190
You've already heard.

26
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,300
While we had no visitors, brother Geraldus.

27
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,840
Especially one that came from as far as you.

28
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,180
Rome's authority Abad unknown distance.

29
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,810
- Even in the confines of the earth. - That's impossible.

30
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,860
- They did not say anything. - I apologize.

31
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,220
The Holy Father has many enemies. Discretion was very important.

32
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,770
- Only despise haste. - You do not know what you're asking for.

33
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,430
Abad, Rome has spoken.

34
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,900
No discussion.

35
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,340
These are dark days for the faithful.

36
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,440
Jerusalem is lost 20 years ago.

37
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,880
Unbelievers around us everywhere, on all coasts.

38
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,750
While conspire heretics among us,

39
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,150
our Holy Father believes that the relic kept here,

40
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,560
has the power to separate the faithful from the unfaithful,

41
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,960
and invoke the wrath of God upon their enemies.

42
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,570
A power that could guarantee victory in the next crusade.

43
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,230
You can not hide such power.

44
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,880
Brother Ciarán ...

45
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,930
Cathal...

46
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,530
Street...

47
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,240
y Diarmuid.

48
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,820
There's a boat waiting in Waterford, in the next waning moon.

49
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,550
In four days.

50
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,060
He will accompany our Cistercian brother there and go to France.

51
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,630
Sacrilege.

52
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,800
Safely deliver our most sacred relic to Rome.

53
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,570
Go with God.

54
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,570
The mute will go with you. They will need someone strong.

55
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,140
I'm sorry to give this burden to you, Ciarán.

56
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,610
Is not that.

57
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,220
That boy.

58
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:57,020
- All I know is the monastery. - That's why you need to go.

59
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,250
Come on.

60
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,460
Come on.

61
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,860
Quiet.

62
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,290
Chill chill.

63
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,710
Rua, Cathal.

64
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,350
It has no markings.

65
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,400
They are afraid of it.

66
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,760
Even before the lightning did not approach her.

67
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,670
Of course they had.

68
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,240
You know what happens to those who disturb the relic.

69
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,980
Perhaps you are not familiar with the stories, brother.

70
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,380
But would not be so willing to take.

71
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,540
Count.

72
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,150
Before we have a golden box for storage.

73
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,020
Others tried to take her. Nordics.

74
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,030
A bloody tide brought to these shores 200 years.

75
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,230
Before coming to Kilmannán.

76
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,070
The monks were sleeping. The lucky ones have died in bed.

77
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,240
But they were awakened by a strange sound.

78
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,940
They left the church and saw an angel striking the relic as a bell.

79
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,180
The monks fled.

80
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,580
When they returned, they saw a big storm had fallen.

81
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Each Nordic ship had been dragged to the bottom of the sea,

82
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,290
where their souls would not rest.

83
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,700
Beside the relic had three Nordic bodies,

84
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,430
Deformed and burned.

85
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,510
No one except someone with a pure heart can touch the relic and survive.

86
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,580
No one.

87
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,750
How long have you served them?

88
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,350
- He is with us for 5 summers. - He's not a monk.

89
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,590
He respects what we charge, but not afraid.

90
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,170
But he's just a dumb. A retarded.

91
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,630
It is not.

92
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,400
It is not delayed.

93
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,810
Diarmuid found. It appeared on our coast ...

94
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,880
- ... in a boat without oars and without food. - In some places it is a punishment.

95
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,940
Perhaps he is in atonement.

96
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,580
It met all the required tasks, even if they are difficult or dangerous.

97
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,090
During all that time, he never spoke.

98
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,790
We would not fit us ask why.

99
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,630
Go to sleep.

100
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,720
What country.

101
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,090
- It rains as the second flood. - You get used.

102
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,730
I did not know you spoke my language, brother Ciarán.

103
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,560
The abbot said he has traveled extensively.

104
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,400
- Already went to Rome? - A long time ago.

105
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,810
And to the Holy Land? Jerusalem?

106
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,320
Tell the foreigner who does not drink water.

107
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,790
There is a fountain fairy upstream.

108
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,520
He says water is not good. She goes out there.

109
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,930
- And what is that? - A place of Sídhe.

110
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,210
Tuatha say DenAnn out by night to jump between those stones.

111
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,610
Play with magic water to bewitch travelers.

112
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,010
Are you afraid of that?

113
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,710
Do they allow pagan superstitions determine their path?

114
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:46,090
- Geraldus, we should not stop here. - We are soldiers of Christ.

115
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,750
But you're running a simple fight?

116
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,290
On behalf of St. Matthias.

117
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,960
Whose relic we have the honor of carrying the foot of the Holy See,

118
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,700
bless and purify this water.

119
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,110
In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

120
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,010
I cast out demons that fogged,

121
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,350
and confino hell, where they will be trapped by flaming currents,

122
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,860
and crushed under the feet of God Almighty.

123
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,460
Enough of this nonsense!

124
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,870
Boy.

125
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,100
Fighting on the border.

126
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,020
Make sure to eat at least 4 or 5 of these leaves.

127
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,410
It's okay.

128
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,060
What's that, boy?

129
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
Watermint.

130
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,330
- Helps relax. - Relieves stomach pain, brother.

131
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,370
- Want to try it? - I have no pain, herbalist.

132
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,870
We'll go far.

133
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,940
The river is on the front. The cross will find gray aliens.

134
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,040
Let's go.

135
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,170
It would take us to the border of Merville.

136
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,380
The Times change.

137
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,050
War is coming. Let's face it our way.

138
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,750
Brothers...

139
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,760
Geraldus.

140
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,560
All I ask is a little faith. It is so difficult?

141
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,860
Geraldus brother.

142
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,570
Sir Raymond.

143
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,380
- We did not expect to see it. - Today was the day I decided to return.

144
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,810
Many choose to return Gaelic territory.

145
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,140
Few return.

146
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,280
Found a memory?

147
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,190
I will discuss that with your father.

148
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,270
You want to find my father? Well, I take you to him.

149
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,200
Bastards...

150
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,870
Your.

151
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,180
What is that?

152
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,950
Death. This land was theirs.

153
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,560
The gray aliens burned.

154
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,260
They prayed for God in the battle. God did not listen.

155
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,760
Then they began to worship other things.

156
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,810
Dugald.

157
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,250
They're thieves.

158
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,190
Reténganlos.

159
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,840
I imagine that when you join the monastery,

160
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,140
They not told you that you could be a workhorse.

161
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,620
He's not a monk, my lord. It is a converted a lay brother.

162
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,630
Some of my men think they know,

163
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,200
but not here.

164
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,940
A crusade, right?

165
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,580
Venice?

166
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,950
¿Constantinople?

167
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,350
Maybe you can solve the problem.

168
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,520
- They made a small bet. - It's dumb.

169
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,220
- He does not speak. - She bit her tongue?

170
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,200
- it is also deaf? - He can hear.

171
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,840
But chooses not to.

172
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,870
Dime...

173
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:31,610
How does a man with no voice confesses sins?

174
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,620
We pray for him.

175
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,360
Lucky...

176
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,730
You have friends who testify for you, simply by faith.

177
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,170
It's like saying, my lord.

178
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,330
They are hunters, they will not again.

179
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,670
Fournier.

180
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,410
Fournier.

181
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,680
My father has awakened?

182
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,290
I brought guests.

183
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,580
Blessed brother.

184
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,770
My lord Baron.

185
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,090
I thought you were still in the south.

186
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,760
My boundaries are like gardens growing.

187
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,530
Before planting new flowers, we need to pull weeds.

188
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,740
He found what he was looking for, I think.

189
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,910
Yes, I've found. Your help will not go unnoticed.

190
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,550
I would have liked to go on pilgrimage with you.

191
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,990
See Rome. See the relic and be presented to His Holiness.

192
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,360
But unfortunately, I'm an old man now.

193
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,370
I'll probably be buried in these lands.

194
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,160
Perhaps you allow

195
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,370
you see the relic,

196
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,940
to give me strength in my prayers,

197
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,840
and my knights inspired by it,

198
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,220
to further assist in their sacred mission.

199
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,800
How the Church can refuse such a loyal servant?

200
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,130
It's a beautiful box.

201
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,430
It is a humble package. Brother Ciarán?

202
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,610
This is unwise.

203
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:25,810
After Judas betrayed Christ, the apostles sought a substitute

204
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,850
Belen and Matthias was chosen.

205
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,860
After the death and resurrection of our Lord,

206
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,260
Matthias traveled north,

207
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,420
to bring the Gospel to the barbarians of Cappadocia.

208
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,440
He was martyred there.

209
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,850
When the stones of the pagans broke their bones and shed their blood.

210
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,750
Matthias gave thanks.

211
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,150
A stone that ended his earthly life.

212
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,980
It caught fire and burned men who killed him.

213
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,560
They cried and cried mercy, but the earth opened and swallowed,

214
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,560
while the body of Matthias ascended into heaven.

215
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,100
And this was the stone.

216
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,500
Awesome.

217
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,440
Forgive the impertinence of my son.

218
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,310
He was born in Ruan, but lives in these lands long ago.

219
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,760
They tear down the forests, and they will attack the mountains.

220
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,340
Encircle the mountains and hide in the marshes.

221
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,310
Is not the same?

222
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,470
How to deal with people like that, brother?

223
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,040
Dry marshes.

224
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,360
He is absolutely right, brother.

225
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,290
- Permit. - Of course.

226
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,460
Raymond, pour me wine.

227
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,670
I'm dry as a swamp.

228
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,230
Load.

229
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,310
You talk about making a deal with the men.

230
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,040
- I would like to know the details. - I was not referring to you.

231
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,620
This implies the sanctity of the relic and the lives of my brothers,

232
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,450
then he deserves respect.

233
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,750
You're not blind, you know what kind of people are.

234
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,520
But you trust everything to protect them.

235
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,220
He was on a crusade, brother.

236
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,340
It is not so difficult to understand.

237
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,210
On the day of judgment, the worst men have greater fear.

238
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,540
At least someone intercede for them.

239
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,480
That is, do they acquit?

240
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:15,690
A mighty man is not without sin.

241
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,490
Baron is not young.

242
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,030
Inevitably he turned to more spiritual matters.

243
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,630
We are the only salvation.

244
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,360
The worst facts unite us.

245
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,600
No.

246
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,270
No.

247
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,770
For us, no.

248
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,120
Brother?

249
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,260
Rua says that foreigners know the war.

250
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,730
He says he is in his blood.

251
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,270
They are descendants of the Norse.

252
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,780
Who conquered France and England, and will do the same here.

253
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,250
But there was real peace in this land, brother?

254
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,660
Before foreigners arrived.

255
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,460
That was a long time ago, Diarmuid.

256
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,800
I was just a child.

257
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,500
A little older than you.

258
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,740
No.

259
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,610
No, there has never been peace.

260
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,650
Not here.

261
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,820
Or anywhere else in the world.

262
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,420
Not since the fall.

263
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,930
Why?

264
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,830
Some say this is not the natural order of things.

265
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,810
Peace needs to grow. You need to be cared for, nurtured.

266
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,040
That's...

267
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,780
This is beyond the reach of most men.

268
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,740
Madrugaste early monjecito.

269
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,380
Always according to the time.

270
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,850
Or maybe you're a spy.

271
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,820
My Sir?

272
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:41,800
Leaving hidden to tell about our route south. Is that?

273
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,420
- No my lord ... - right?

274
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,100
So why are you running away?

275
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,370
I serve Christ.

276
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,600
- But you serve your clan before, right? - Do not.

277
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,120
My father always been impressed with devout men.

278
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,910
And me? I have my doubts.

279
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,860
Anyone can wear monk's robes.

280
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,590
Your...

281
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,000
Raymond, gather your men. We celebrate Mass before leaving.

282
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,080
Then this will be for another time.

283
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,360
Also look at the other side.

284
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,410
Because sometimes my husband take that path.

285
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,970
Something ails you, brother?

286
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,780
No.

287
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,020
Here.

288
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,790
Death!

289
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,260
Your goes to talk to my father.

290
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,900
Tell that this atrocity will not go unanswered. Then come back!

291
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,100
- What are you doing? - What is it?

292
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,470
Your father said you and your men ...

293
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,240
Cowards are on foot.

294
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,610
I will not take long to finish them.

295
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,480
With a third of our men.

296
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,510
My men.

297
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,490
Do not worry, Fournier.

298
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,890
Back before nightfall, to protect them.

299
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,960
- Is there another route? - It snowed a lot this year ...

300
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,600
The thaw brought down two other bridges.

301
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,980
The nearest is becoming noon.

302
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,550
Are we on the holes?

303
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,490
- And what are they? - Only forests.

304
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,590
They have a bad reputation, and do not usually travel around.

305
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,160
It will change.

306
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,670
Soldiers, move.

307
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,150
Alto.

308
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,900
Fournier, what's that?

309
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,510
In education, their shields.

310
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,750
Hold your positions.

311
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,150
He has covered.

312
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,050
Muévanse.

313
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,570
Shields.

314
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,970
Hold your positions.

315
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,950
Maintained.

316
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,020
Take out the swords.

317
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,580
Keep your distance. Closed positions.

318
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,490
Shoot.

319
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,850
Shoot.

320
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,160
Now.

321
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,220
Do not touch that.

322
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,360
Do not touch that.

323
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,260
Detente.

324
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,720
It's me.

325
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,620
It's me.

326
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,060
It's me.

327
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
We have to go.

328
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:35,210
We have to go.

329
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,070
¿Ciarán? Brother?

330
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,400
I lost in the trees.

331
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,910
Where is the stone?

332
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,520
Where is? Where is the stone?

333
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,120
We need to get it back.

334
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:04,840
They did not hear the bell?

335
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,040
They do not witnessed the miracle?

336
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,810
When wild stone desecrated St. Matthias,

337
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,040
they saw how God forged an instrument of revenge

338
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,210
from the humblest servant.

339
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:31,590
You're in the service of the Church, right?

340
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,130
"Who smote many nations and slew mighty kings ..."

341
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:45,970
Continue the tranquil heart. These are enemies of Christ.

342
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,020
He rejoices with every enemy you destroy.

343
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,650
Your work is not done yet.

344
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,760
And this is for all of us.

345
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,100
And what do you want us to do?

346
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,600
Our comrades died. They killed our brothers.

347
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:14,900
- We do not know where we are. - A wagon, a prisoner.

348
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,510
Must have left traces, do not you think?

349
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,210
The young lord of Merville said he would return.

350
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:25,220
He has men, gentlemen. We can wait for him.

351
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,020
What if the others return first?

352
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,190
It is our duty to try.

353
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,130
They are many.

354
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,930
We can create a distraction. Throw them off.

355
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,330
As far as we go with the locket on the coast.

356
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,380
We do not need the locket.

357
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,580
Just what it is inside.

358
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,450
I will take it.

359
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,650
I'll take the relic.

360
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,820
One of you will have to release Ciarán.

361
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,690
We can not risk to recover the relic.

362
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,200
Not by a man.

363
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,460
How can you say that? That was the oath we took.

364
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,600
These bodies are not ours.

365
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,000
The Lord can do with them what he believes is right.

366
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:47,310
If Brother Ciarán were here in my place, he would say the same.

367
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,380
Although he is alive.

368
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,850
How long you need to realize that gone?

369
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,560
We can not leave.

370
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,420
Let us pray for his soul.

371
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,590
Stay here.

372
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:14,870
Gentlemen.

373
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,170
Murchoe, Responsibility.

374
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,040
With me.

375
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,420
What he's doing?

376
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,520
Brother Ciarán.

377
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,090
¿Diarmuid?

378
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,960
¿Diarmuid?

379
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,390
Brother, please silence.

380
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,430
Save energy when we run.

381
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,600
Wait.

382
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,570
We were not told what we steal for you.

383
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:06,380
We were not told how much gold was at stake.

384
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:10,250
Nor they would fight so much to protect him.

385
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,920
Judas.

386
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:19,160
- Where is Maelseachlain? - We did what we asked.

387
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,770
Soldiers killed.

388
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:28,030
But one of the monks shattered our men.

389
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,470
Maelseachlain also.

390
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:35,810
He says Maelseachlain is dead, and that one of the monks killed.

391
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:42,110
A monk? It was not a monk, was the devil.

392
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:48,520
Are they with her?

393
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,200
Diarmuid, listen. You have to go. You have to go now.

394
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,240
I can not leave, not without the stone, not without you.

395
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,200
I hope the Lord will forgive me, but pull the wagon.

396
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:08,610
- What? Where? - On a clear Galanthus.

397
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,920
In the last place I saw you following her. It is close to the trail.

398
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:17,250
Take it and DIRIG East.

399
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,560
Keep it safe and you too, Diarmuid.

400
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,630
Then Morrigna.

401
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,030
The agreement must be changed.

402
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,470
- They want the box. - As well.

403
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:37,110
I just want what's inside.

404
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,420
Go away. Go away.

405
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,840
Where is the stone, brother?

406
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,380
You swore to protect.

407
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:20,720
And to her.

408
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,220
I have sworn to honor ...

409
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,850
and obey my King.

410
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:37,070
My father is fighting with him.

411
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:44,210
A relic like yours would be a powerful weapon for negotiation.

412
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:48,470
Presumably it would be well rewarded.

413
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,750
King is not happy with the power that some of the subordinate obtained.

414
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,590
He thinks they are very friendly cousins ​​in Normandy.

415
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:04,420
A wise man would do everything possible to show their loyalty.

416
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,260
And in doing so.

417
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,000
Betraying the opportunity to save his own father.

418
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,440
My father is a coward.

419
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:24,220
He is dying.

420
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:30,310
He prefers to crawl to the church to secure the future of the family.

421
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,090
Where is the relic?

422
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:42,730
Brother, sooner or later will go to Rome.

423
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:48,070
What difference does it spend a year or two with the king?

424
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,780
I do not know where it is.

425
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,550
You're lying.

426
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,580
That's bad.

427
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,590
I expected more from a man of the Church.

428
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:20,400
I've got this ... with a father in Constantinople.

429
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,110
A strange man.

430
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:26,980
He used it ...

431
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,640
to convince the Greeks ...

432
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:34,580
to tell us where they had hidden the gold of his church.

433
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,850
It always worked.

434
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,980
Your last chance.

435
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:05,940
Where is?

436
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,290
What are you feeling?

437
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,490
Those are your guts.

438
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:22,900
Writhing around the arrow, like worms on a hook.

439
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,970
You want to see them?

440
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,710
Jesus.

441
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:34,580
Jesus.

442
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,910
Have mercy on my soul.

443
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:43,420
Already he suffered enough, brother.

444
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:49,590
I can give you a quick death. A merciful death.

445
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:55,000
Tell me where the relic.

446
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,730
Jesus, Jesus.

447
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,610
Dugald, search the tracker.

448
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,070
If the relic is not near the battlefield,

449
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,240
one of the monks must have it.

450
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,840
Did he not tell her?

451
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:12,250
No, he wants to be a martyr.

452
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:15,450
Gathers men.

453
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:18,290
Jesus.

454
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:22,950
You agonizarás to death, and for what?

455
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:27,190
Although we do not find the relic, another stone will.

456
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,030
I will put a beautiful box and people will accept it.

457
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,670
Even the king or the Pope.

458
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:40,910
- Think about it. - God, He loves you.

459
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,050
He forgives. I forgive you.

460
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,670
Here.

461
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:23,780
It's her?

462
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,560
It is.

463
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:36,030
You disobeyed me. I was not going to leave Ciarán there.

464
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:41,360
Do you have any idea of ​​the responsibility I carry?

465
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,430
Our purpose was ordained by the office of God on Earth.

466
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,010
It can not be jeopardized by anything or anyone.

467
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,410
Our obligation is to obey.

468
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:59,440
Brother, a war is raging around us.

469
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,950
Our enemy is the devil, and is at war.

470
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:08,930
He expects all your life, eternity, for a moment of weakness.

471
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,060
Like yours.

472
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:15,060
No yield a él.

473
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,800
Brother.

474
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,240
They will kill us.

475
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,040
We're alone.

476
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:09,050
They have riders and horses.

477
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:11,780
- You will find our trail. - Cathal.

478
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,820
And we'll kill him.

479
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,060
We are not alone.

480
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,570
We are never alone.

481
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,630
Ten fe.

482
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,700
Praise.

483
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,820
God heard us.

484
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,250
Still.

485
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:41,470
How far do you think you can go?

486
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,670
Twenty paces at most.

487
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:47,810
Or do they think they can walk on water?

488
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,450
It does not have to be.

489
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:07,300
Deliver the stone and let you live.

490
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:14,500
I gave the same choice one of his brother monks.

491
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:21,080
But unfortunately, it was foolish.

492
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:27,980
It is not a difficult decision.

493
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:32,920
Not for a soldier.

494
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,120
You look different.

495
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,660
I assure you one thing.

496
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:44,860
A man can change his appearance ...

497
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:50,280
or how to speak ...

498
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:55,810
but not who he is.

499
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,650
As well...

500
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,260
Stay with stone.

501
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,020
I can find another.

502
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:09,790
But I will kill the Cistercian! Will be worth!

503
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,560
Screw you.

504
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,000
Geraldus brother ...

505
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:22,070
I did not know if you would have succeeded.

506
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,310
Salvation doors will be closed forever for you.

507
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:26,610
Salvation?

508
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,580
If I wait, there will be another crusade.

509
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:33,980
Another possibility of acquittal.

510
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:37,610
This is the way the world works. You'll burn you for it ...

511
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:44,990
like your father,

512
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,460
He told his friends monks ...

513
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:53,800
Because the Church has entrusted

514
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:56,810
en Geraldus Trencavel d'Albi.

515
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:59,070
¿An important task?

516
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,480
Since you report it as a heretic,

517
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:12,560
when he refused to repent, you, your only son,

518
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:16,150
you send him to the wheel, and then at the stake.

519
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:22,500
After the land you go to church, your future is guaranteed in Rome.

520
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:25,000
He awaits you in hell!

521
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,020
Find them.

522
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,380
Here.

523
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,450
Where to now?

524
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,800
Excuse me, friend.

525
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,810
We want to go to Waterford.

526
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,490
It is beyond what we usually go.

527
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,990
Not that it matters. We are full, no passengers.

528
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:38,600
Please.

529
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:44,530
Although there were space, they seem to have nothing to give in return.

530
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:47,770
Tell them that we will pay when we get to port.

531
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,340
Tell them.

532
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,340
- Our colleagues will pay you. - Of course they will pay.

533
01:15:56,310 --> 01:16:00,380
All have a rich friend, downstream.

534
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,650
- Why are you laughing?! - Geraldus.

535
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:07,020
We are men of God. Does not that mean anything in this damned country?

536
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,920
Brother lowers his voice.

537
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,360
We can force them, we can.

538
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:21,040
- No, do not do it. - We need them.

539
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:23,230
- No. - You're disobeying again?

540
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,950
You are not worthy to carry the relic. There is something in you, boy ...

541
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,040
- ... something evil. - Wait.

542
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:19,060
What he said is true?

543
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,430
About your father.

544
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:30,530
He harbored heretics.

545
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:33,270
He helped them flee the trial.

546
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:37,680
I served the Church in the best way he could.

547
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:39,510
My conscience is clear.

548
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,910
What else you want to know, boy?

549
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,720
Nothing.

550
01:17:56,690 --> 01:18:00,830
I asked him to repent, but did not repent.

551
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,770
Until the end, he refused to believe he had done anything wrong.

552
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:12,150
I learned something very important that day.

553
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,750
He did not lose faith in the Church.

554
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:21,330
He lost the fear of it.

555
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:14,110
- What are you doing? - We have to go.

556
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:17,980
Can not despair in the sea, boy.

557
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:24,190
If they were not so desperate, we would have expected high tide.

558
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:26,220
We can not wait.

559
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,330
Unless you want to go out and drag.

560
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:41,140
I knew this was a bad idea.

561
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:47,040
Take your bloody stones. You can walk from here.

562
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,950
They leave no witnesses. They will not leave anyone.

563
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,380
Everyone leave.

564
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:19,310
No, they can not. We are so close. We will not get it.

565
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:25,780
This is our chance.

566
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:28,980
Absolution who rejected the Normans can be yours.

567
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,010
You've done a lot, but it was not enough.

568
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:36,190
Not if that evil prevents us from fulfilling our pilgrimage.

569
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:41,030
Who died in the service of our Lord, you have a place in heaven.

570
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,730
- No matter what you did before. - What are you saying?

571
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,410
Look at me!

572
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:53,480
You smell blood, brother! This is the only way to purify!

573
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,980
All martyrs will sit next to God.

574
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,410
Salvanos.

575
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,010
Salvanos.

576
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,250
Salvanos.

577
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,970
No, push in the name of Christ.

578
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:25,640
Go with God.

579
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:19,960
No matter, take the stone.

580
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:45,620
Raise the front.

581
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:42,720
Dugald.

582
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:04,800
Take them, for God's sake! TAKE oars!

583
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:12,600
Cathal.

584
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:50,780
Take all the men left over. The reach in Waterford.

585
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:00,520
Diarmuid.

586
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:03,920
Cathal, Cathal...

587
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:08,560
They are fighting, he will not revive.

588
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,130
You will suffer.

589
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,230
And they will see.

590
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:02,990
Who are you?

591
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,220
Where are you from?

592
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,120
From hell.

593
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,460
From hell.

594
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,150
Have you heard?

595
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,170
Did you hear the bells?

596
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:15,030
The bell inspires an army of men like him.

597
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:23,830
Men recover Jerusalem. Men who will dominate the world.

598
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:31,030
Heretics, infidels, unbelievers.

599
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:34,370
If you do not hear the truth, they will suffer.

600
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:38,750
End all doubt.

601
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:44,720
Stay with the Church and live, if you oppose die.

602
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:55,370
What are you doing?

603
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:57,960
No.

604
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:02,140
For the love of God, stop!

605
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:03,570
This is God's.

606
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,010
- I'm gonna take her back! - Do not.

607
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:14,510
The devil is in you, boy.

608
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:12,640
Where to now?

609
01:30:00,000 --> 01:32:00,000
