1
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:50,998
Blame it on Fidel

2
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:16,277
Why isn't she doing anything?

3
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:17,957
She doesn't speak French.

4
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:22,297
Her name is Pilar.
She is Spanish.

5
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:25,445
What's going on here?

6
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,708
Yes?

7
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:29,657
I'm teaching them
to cut fruit properly,

8
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:31,297
but they're not very gifted.

9
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:33,257
You're such a lady!

10
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:36,095
Children, you may leave the table.

11
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:39,328
Isabelle, forget about them.

12
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,596
Hurry up and make me
some grandchildren!

13
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,201
- There's no rush.
- Of course.

14
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:50,071
You should go kiss your grandpa.
He'd love that.

15
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:18,481
Isabelle, you look lovely!

16
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,482
You'll see.
You will have your own room.

17
00:03:57,597 --> 00:04:00,945
Would you like to go swimming?

18
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:03,915
You could learn how to play music.

19
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,101
We'll go see clowns at the circus.

20
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:08,152
Do you like the circus?
What else do you like?

21
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:12,543
You'll see that in no time
you'll be speaking French.

22
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:13,844
That comes easy to you.

23
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,399
Cat!

24
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:20,670
François, don't!
You'll get me dirty!

25
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:22,925
Leave me alone!

26
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,374
Stop following me around!

27
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:31,634
Anna, be careful,
or you'll tear that veil!

28
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:33,295
Give it back to Isabelle.

29
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:38,524
Why is Dad always
with Pilar and her mom?

30
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,206
Don't bother them.

31
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:42,684
Life is tough
for your aunt and your cousin.

32
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:44,366
Give me a hand.

33
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:48,646
Was your bridal veil as long?

34
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,860
I had none.

35
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:51,737
We got married at City Hall.

36
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:54,453
You said there was a party there!

37
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:57,075
Just my parents, Mathieu,
and some cousins.

38
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,374
That's all?

39
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,312
It didn't matter to us.

40
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,798
Mathieu and Isabelle love festivities.

41
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,482
And it pleases your grandparents.

42
00:05:05,593 --> 00:05:08,211
This is their place now.

43
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:11,411
They'll live with Granny and Grandpa?

44
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,065
Lucky them!

45
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:21,532
Mom, doesn't Isabelle
look like a princess?

46
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:41,833
You're not playing
with the other kids?

47
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:45,608
No. All they do is run.

48
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:50,493
If you stay here, I'll tickle you.

49
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:54,365
Tickle, tickle!

50
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,823
Stop!

51
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:11,070
Will Pilar and her mom
go back to Spain?

52
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,046
Not right now.

53
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:16,159
They're never going home?

54
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:22,792
There are laws in Spain
against people like Marga or Quino.

55
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:25,794
I'll explain some other time.

56
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,696
But you're a lawyer!
You can help them go home!

57
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:32,307
It's too complicated now.

58
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:35,590
In Spain, you can't do as you please.

59
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:37,830
Where will they go?

60
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:39,515
To our place in Paris.

61
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,706
In our home?

62
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,924
Until they find a place, yes.

63
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,619
Will that take long?

64
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:53,835
What is it, my princess?

65
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:58,380
They should just go home.

66
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:01,467
Anna.

67
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:04,974
Your uncle Quino died.

68
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,771
I had to smuggle them out.

69
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:11,917
I can't send them back there.

70
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:15,738
We have to take care of them.

71
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:25,385
If François was in danger,
wouldn't you help him?

72
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:29,313
Anna.

73
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,791
Don't pretend you don't understand!

74
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:33,255
She's my sister,

75
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:35,458
and in these past 10 years,
I never helped her.

76
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:36,689
I did nothing!

77
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,510
So we must all take care
of her and Pilar!

78
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:58,725
You may open your notebooks.

79
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,554
What did you get?

80
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:09,041
- And you?
- 9 out of 10!

81
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,647
Good morning,
Sister Anne-Marie!

82
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,040
See you later,
Sister Genevieve!

83
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:28,399
Take your Bible study notebook, girls.

84
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:39,770
Anna, homework time!

85
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:48,150
Why leave?
You can live here!

86
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:50,424
There's room for everyone!

87
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,240
I don't know if I can.

88
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,266
I don't know
what I am going to do.

89
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:55,762
I fought for 15 years.

90
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:58,745
15 years of my life.
Always with Quino.

91
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:01,445
Now I have nothing.

92
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:03,619
You could fight from here.

93
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:05,745
And what about your daughter?

94
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,443
You must think
of your daughter now.

95
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:09,544
This life isn't for me.

96
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:13,715
A family, a house, a job.
That's your choice.

97
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:16,823
I can't live that way.

98
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:20,321
But thanks, anyway.

99
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:22,757
- Thank you for...
- What are you doing?

100
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:26,946
Do your homework!
It will be time for your bath soon!

101
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:33,352
François, stop splashing me!

102
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:37,307
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Mom.

103
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,683
Mom, I got 9 out of 10 on my essay!

104
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,201
In Bible study,
we did Genesis, my favorite!

105
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,826
Your favorite what?

106
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:46,622
Story. How the world began.

107
00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:06,268
You only like stories
about princesses.

108
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:52,715
Get up, François!

109
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:55,891
Mom, why has Dad quit his job?

110
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:59,043
I hope you didn't bother him.
I said to leave him alone.

111
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:01,641
He needs to think.

112
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:03,774
So, are you going to ask me?

113
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,942
It's the 25th of the month.

114
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,804
Your magazine!

115
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:19,566
I can't find Mom's article!

116
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:23,988
Anna, this is not the time!
Put it away!

117
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,350
Tell us about your essay.

118
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,533
It was about our vacation
in Bordeaux.

119
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:32,027
I wrote about Isabelle
and Mathieu's wedding.

120
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:35,489
But I didn't write about Uncle Quino.
I didn't know what to say.

121
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:38,377
You did well.
Some things are secret.

122
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:39,661
Why?

123
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:41,388
Like having Communists in the family.

124
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,213
- What?
- Communists!

125
00:10:43,362 --> 00:10:44,539
The <i>barbudos!</i>

126
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:46,552
I had to leave Cuba because of Fidel
and the Communists.

127
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:48,763
They took everything!
My house, my land, everything!

128
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:50,279
Damn them!

129
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:51,921
They almost caused a nuclear war!

130
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,706
A nuclear war?

131
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:57,296
Listen, Anna!
I hope your aunt leaves!

132
00:10:57,384 --> 00:11:02,140
She'll warp their mind,
like all those dirty reds!

133
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:43,150
Third! You can do better than that!

134
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:07,524
How do you say <i>patata?</i>

135
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:09,905
Potato.

136
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:11,345
- Potato.
- Very good.

137
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,362
If your aunt is Spanish,
then your dad must be Spanish too?

138
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:17,363
Not really.
He never goes there.

139
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,849
His parents died when I was little.

140
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,410
- But he has an accent.
- Really?

141
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:25,535
<i>Judias verdes</i> is green beans.

142
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:28,227
I'd never seen someone
whose dad was dead.

143
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:30,272
But she seems normal.

144
00:12:30,352 --> 00:12:32,140
Why can't they go home?

145
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:34,582
- They're Communists!
- What's that?

146
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:36,998
Filomena says
they're red and bearded.

147
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:40,640
But I think they don't fear the Lord,
and they move all the time.

148
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:42,172
- Really?
- Yes!

149
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,628
Pilar doesn't take Bible study
at school.

150
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:48,133
In Spain, they had to move
all the time!

151
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:50,529
Soon they're going to move again.

152
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:54,314
They're moving to an apartment.

153
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:58,440
Don't stay there, girls.
Take this to your parents.

154
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,369
Why did you invite them?

155
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:31,470
You're here all day.
We never go out.

156
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:34,290
Why them?
He's unbearable!

157
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:36,177
I thought it was a good idea.

158
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:39,130
Anna and Cecile get along well,
and her mother is nice.

159
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,878
No, she's not nice!

160
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:42,978
She's dumb!

161
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:46,379
They're just like the people
we are friends with.

162
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:51,095
You can't stand anything anymore,
locked up in your office all day!

163
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,305
Why won't you go to Spain?

164
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,336
Or do something about Spain?

165
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,806
- It's useless.
- Be a lawyer for refugees!

166
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,523
Even here, things are blocked.

167
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:01,919
Then, leave!

168
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:05,116
Go to Latin America!
Things are happening there.

169
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:07,127
What about you?

170
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:08,784
I'll come along!

171
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,489
You'd come?

172
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,284
Yes.

173
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,037
And the kids?

174
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:18,011
They'll be fine.

175
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,323
They've spent two weeks alone
with Filomena before.

176
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:29,914
Children!
Your parents are on the phone!

177
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:31,827
Hurry!

178
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:35,580
- What time is it there?
- <i>Almost noon.</i>

179
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,284
What presents will you bring back?

180
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:40,712
<i>Let it be a surprise.</i>
<i>I can't talk for long.</i>

181
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:45,373
<i>On the calendar I left you,</i>
<i>change the last date to November 20.</i>

182
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:47,962
- <i>Big kiss, my love!</i>
- Me too.

183
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:50,267
<i>Is everything okay, Anna?</i>

184
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:53,200
Dad, why did you change
your return date again?

185
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:56,583
<i>Things are happening here.</i>
<i>We'll tell you when we're back.</i>

186
00:14:56,673 --> 00:14:58,396
<i>How was it at Marga and Pilar's?</i>

187
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,528
I don't know. We didn't go.

188
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:03,076
<i>You didn't go?</i>
<i>Let me talk to Filomena.</i>

189
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,014
- Give it to me!
- Okay.

190
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:08,397
Dad, why so long?
When will you be back?

191
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,397
1... 2... 3...

192
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:12,852
They have changed
their return date three times!

193
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:15,308
They left so that Dad could think.

194
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:19,291
When they're back,
it will be just like before.

195
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:25,026
Dad says a lot is happening there.
That must mean it's good.

196
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:31,553
So, what else do you do on Sundays
with your parents?

197
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:34,450
We do tickle, tickle!

198
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,479
Then we all take a bath together!

199
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,350
All four of you?

200
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:39,602
Naked?

201
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:41,569
Sure!

202
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:45,006
Well! We've already missed Church.

203
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:48,733
You'll have your bath alone today.

204
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,831
All alone!

205
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:11,803
<i>People of France,</i>

206
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:15,200
<i>France is widowed.</i>

207
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,616
<i>In 1940, he saved our honor.</i>

208
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,594
General De Gaulle has died.

209
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:26,279
<i>In 1944, he led us</i>
<i>to liberation and victory.</i>

210
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,297
It's all over.

211
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:05,571
Chile is a rich land,
but it has too many poor people.

212
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,066
The wealth must be shared.

213
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:08,943
We must intervene in every sector:

214
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,888
Education, healthcare
and land reform.

215
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,806
We'll give free milk to every child
under the age of 4 every day.

216
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:18,800
We'll build 100,000 new houses,
so every family owns one.

217
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:21,946
Here, this is also for you.

218
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,890
It's a <i>momio.</i> A mummy.

219
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:31,702
In Chile, that's how they call those
who are against Allende.

220
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,923
We arrived in Chile
as elections were happening,

221
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:41,625
important presidential elections.

222
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:43,636
We were in Santiago.

223
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:47,198
It was a strange
and exciting moment.

224
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:50,456
Allende got elected,
but there were threats of a putsch.

225
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:53,222
What's a "poontch"?

226
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:57,130
It's when the army
overthrows the President.

227
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,763
They tried, but it didn't work.

228
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,973
Allende is now officially President.

229
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:06,422
Are you going to work with him, Dad?

230
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:09,327
I'll help him
establish ties with France.

231
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:10,880
Are we going to live in Chile?

232
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,042
No, but we must make changes.

233
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:17,455
We must all be united and support
your dad's important work.

234
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:20,259
How will you get by?

235
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,082
- Marie, what will you do?
- Keep writing for <i>Marie Claire.</i>

236
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,587
I can pitch them many articles now!

237
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:27,376
What do we have to change?

238
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,655
You said there would be changes.

239
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:30,660
Don't worry.

240
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,253
If we all do our share,
we'll get by.

241
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:57,020
- Hands up! It's a "poontch"!
- Not funny.

242
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:59,448
François, go finish your breakfast!

243
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:01,934
Go on!

244
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:05,646
You don't want to eat?

245
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:07,134
Come.

246
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:11,981
There. That's the first time
I measured your height.

247
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,696
This will be my first Christmas
without you.

248
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,432
It won't be a real Christmas.

249
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,900
Grandpa and Granny
won't be here either.

250
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:21,160
There will just be Marga and Pilar.

251
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:22,763
It's all because of them.

252
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,740
Your parents say
they can't pay me anymore.

253
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:28,515
But I know why I was fired.
They've become Communists!

254
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,944
Is that why we're moving?

255
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,074
You are like me!

256
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,113
I fled Cuba, driven from my home!

257
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:35,169
Now you, too,
must abandon your house!

258
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:38,886
- It's Fidel, he drives them nuts!
- Then...

259
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,233
Fidel is to blame.

260
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:25,165
Mom!

261
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,892
Mom!

262
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:29,316
Mom!

263
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:31,281
Anna! What is it?

264
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,792
I dreamt we were in our old house.

265
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,434
What's that noise?

266
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,838
It's a meeting for my work.

267
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:42,229
Again!
We always have people over!

268
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:45,872
Come say hello for once.

269
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,349
This is Emilio.

270
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:49,751
And Pierre.

271
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:52,440
They work with me
for Allende's government in Chile.

272
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,868
My daughter Anna.
My little mummy.

273
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,004
You mean... like those mummies?

274
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,012
Your daughter is reactionary?

275
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:04,167
She insisted on staying
in Catholic school.

276
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:06,130
She made a real scene!

277
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:07,942
You put her in Catholic school?

278
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:11,312
It was a long time ago.
Marie wanted her to go.

279
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:12,467
Why do you say that?

280
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:13,828
My school is fine!

281
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,451
You liked it, too!

282
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:26,935
Your brother sleeps well.

283
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,724
He breathes so loud,
it keeps me awake.

284
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:32,401
Don't exaggerate.

285
00:21:33,152 --> 00:21:35,224
What's that?

286
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:40,620
I told you not to read this anymore!
Mickey Mouse is a fascist!

287
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:45,937
Don't sulk.
I am leaving tomorrow.

288
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,339
For as long as last time?

289
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,844
No.

290
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:52,437
And Mom is staying here.

291
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:55,077
And the lady
who picks you up from school.

292
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:57,949
- Panayota!
- Yes, Panayota.

293
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,906
She's nice, right?

294
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:04,330
Okay, she's not much fun,
but she's very unhappy.

295
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:07,208
Her husband is in jail.
She fled from Greece.

296
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:08,288
You know where that is?

297
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,664
Tomorrow look in your atlas.

298
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:13,663
Now go to sleep.

299
00:22:13,762 --> 00:22:16,576
Filomena had to leave Cuba too,
to escape the <i>barbudos.</i>

300
00:22:16,656 --> 00:22:18,860
That's different.

301
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:21,025
Go to sleep.

302
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:41,280
Hello, Sister Anne-Marie!

303
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:45,978
Miss Anna de la Mesa?

304
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:49,043
Your parents want you
out of Bible study.

305
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:55,616
This has been granted exceptionally
to Miss de la Mesa.

306
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:58,894
There will be no others.

307
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:16,017
Come, Anna.

308
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,423
I don't like the skin.

309
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,552
We can't eat yet.
We haven't had our bath.

310
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:44,244
Tomato skin is good for your health.

311
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,020
Eat!

312
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:22,945
Is <i>Marie Claire</i> for me?

313
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,245
- It's late. I must leave.
- Thanks.

314
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:35,308
You can leave the table, François.

315
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,101
It's very good.
You should taste it.

316
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,613
Why can't I go to Bible study?

317
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,848
Didn't Dad explain?

318
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:02,338
He just said religious stories
were nonsense.

319
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:04,779
Anna, you insisted to stay
in that school,

320
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:06,477
and I promised you would.

321
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:11,557
But to convince your dad,
I had to make some concessions.

322
00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:14,815
Now I'll heat your plate,
and you'll finish it!

323
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:20,578
Don't waste food!
Some people have nothing to eat!

324
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:26,600
Your brother isn't so fussy!

325
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:29,048
All these changes
are hard for him, too!

326
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:32,203
It's tough for me, too.

327
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,068
So help me. And eat.

328
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,851
- I want to go to Bible study!
- Stop it!

329
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:41,002
I want Bible study,
our big house and Filomena back!

330
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:43,078
You're not the only one
who wants things!

331
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,006
I want your dad here!
I'm sick of unpacking!

332
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:48,703
I want to write on politics,
not cooking!

333
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:50,636
With Filomena, life was better!

334
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,797
We ate normal food,
we had a garden,

335
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:54,748
we bathed before dinner!

336
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:56,779
You want a bath? Fine!
It will calm you down!

337
00:25:57,588 --> 00:26:00,206
I'll calm down! I promise!

338
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,552
I'll calm down!

339
00:26:01,675 --> 00:26:02,624
Are you done?

340
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,850
I hate you! I hate you!

341
00:26:04,948 --> 00:26:06,027
I hate you!

342
00:26:14,122 --> 00:26:17,121
Have you and Dad
become Communists?

343
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:18,646
Why do you ask?

344
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:20,615
Are we poor now?

345
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,661
Poor?

346
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:25,005
We eat weird things
in this tiny apartment.

347
00:26:25,104 --> 00:26:27,951
Those people come all the time.

348
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:30,176
We have less money,
but we're not poor.

349
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,865
If you ask Grandpa and Granny
for money,

350
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:35,309
can we have our old house
and Filomena back?

351
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,699
Anna, please.

352
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:40,706
Do you want to sleep with me?

353
00:26:40,781 --> 00:26:43,879
If we find money,
can life be as before?

354
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:48,520
You don't find money.
You earn it or save it.

355
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:53,729
I won't ask my parents
to pay for my heating and light.

356
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:57,551
That's enough.
Let's sleep.

357
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,380
What are you doing?

358
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:26,342
Tell me, what are you doing there?

359
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:31,445
You talk of right and wrong,
and now you steal!

360
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:33,531
It's to pay our bills!

361
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,475
Next Thursday, you'll apologize.

362
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:36,881
Mom, my snack!

363
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,630
I forgot. This isn't the time!

364
00:27:39,731 --> 00:27:42,830
You also forgot to comb me.

365
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:04,237
Your snack is a "blacklava."
It's very good.

366
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:23,269
What are you doing?

367
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:25,260
We must not turn this light on!

368
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:28,617
- Why?
- Because.

369
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:35,763
François, turn it off!

370
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,964
What are you doing now?

371
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:46,879
Leave me alone!

372
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:07,032
I don't mind
that you quit Bible study.

373
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:11,704
Can I come for tea on Candlemas
and play in your garden?

374
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:13,015
Can I sleep over?

375
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,107
Quiet, girls!

376
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,538
There's enough daylight!

377
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,602
But...

378
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:34,615
Aren't you in the park?

379
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:36,573
Isabelle!

380
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,449
Why are you crying?

381
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:48,861
Is it because of the General?

382
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,444
- What's wrong with her?
- I'll explain later, not now.

383
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,949
We have to talk.

384
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:55,274
Don't worry.

385
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,593
- I can't stay with you?
- Take them outside.

386
00:29:57,685 --> 00:30:00,848
- My sister-in-law needs me.
- All right.

387
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:16,004
You're not eating it?

388
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:22,196
Don't you want to go play?

389
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:28,906
You and I could play a game,
or I can tell you a story.

390
00:30:29,623 --> 00:30:31,990
I can tell you a story of mythology.

391
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,737
Any princesses in it?

392
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,206
Even better.
There are goddesses.

393
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:40,093
To understand, you must know
that in the beginning...

394
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:41,556
The beginning?

395
00:30:41,654 --> 00:30:44,042
When the world started,
if you prefer.

396
00:30:44,157 --> 00:30:46,710
Shall I go on?

397
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:50,149
In the beginning,
there was only Raos.

398
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:51,406
Raos?

399
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,404
Like the word "chaos".

400
00:30:53,492 --> 00:30:56,044
Everything was born out of Chaos.

401
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:59,025
First came the Day and the Night.

402
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:01,449
Then Gaia, the Earth.

403
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,807
She's the oldest Greek goddess.

404
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,116
The Mother of all living beings.

405
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:10,566
She gave birth to Uranos, the Sky.

406
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:12,315
She made it just big enough

407
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:18,079
so the Sky and the Earth
fit perfectly together.

408
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,596
This isn't the zoological gardens!

409
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:41,256
I didn't say we would go there.
I said it was a surprise.

410
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:47,044
- Hello.
- Hello.

411
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:49,829
Hello.

412
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:02,038
Free abortion and contraception

413
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:04,763
We're fighting the 1920 law.

414
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,619
- Hello.
- Hello.

415
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:23,936
Here are your pills.

416
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:27,525
It's very simple.
Take one a day.

417
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,125
Is Suzanne here?

418
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,739
Yes. I'll get her.

419
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:36,710
You could say hello.

420
00:32:36,811 --> 00:32:38,436
Are they gypsies?

421
00:32:38,547 --> 00:32:40,401
What are you saying?

422
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,115
Did you see how they're dressed?

423
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:47,073
Filomena said gypsies kidnap kids
and sell them to circuses!

424
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:48,957
I tried to call you.
Isabelle left.

425
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,113
Was Isabelle the surprise?

426
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:53,794
- What? I talked to her yesterday!
- I know, everything was fine.

427
00:32:53,897 --> 00:32:56,318
But she spoke to your brother
and decided to leave.

428
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,545
Couldn't you stop her?

429
00:32:57,656 --> 00:33:00,306
Marie, we help women
who want abortion and peace.

430
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,254
This is not jail.

431
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,033
Stay for a while!

432
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:06,948
You wanted Anna to see the house.

433
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:09,297
- Would you like that?
- No, we'll go.

434
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:11,836
Don't take it that way.
You didn't force her.

435
00:33:11,918 --> 00:33:15,081
An abortion is tough
on a young woman like her.

436
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:17,432
I want you to write that book.

437
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:20,044
So women like Isabelle
know they can choose.

438
00:33:20,997 --> 00:33:24,192
Okay. I'll call you.

439
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:26,111
Let's go.

440
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:35,559
Mom, what's an abortion?

441
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:37,894
What's an abortion?

442
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:40,583
Don't shout!

443
00:33:40,673 --> 00:33:43,355
I'll explain later.
Come along.

444
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:48,608
Don't be sad. It's normal
that she went to Bordeaux.

445
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:51,826
Her house and her husband are there.

446
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,188
Stop talking nonsense.

447
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:55,243
Mom!

448
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:00,187
Mom!

449
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:03,374
Mom! I want to go to Bordeaux
for my vacation!

450
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:09,306
Tickle, tickle!

451
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:12,949
Tickle, tickle!

452
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:19,184
That's enough.

453
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,215
That's enough.

454
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:22,608
That's enough.

455
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:29,596
Calm down, kids.
See you later.

456
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:32,428
- See you later.
- See you later.

457
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:35,983
Time for your bath.

458
00:34:40,527 --> 00:34:42,861
Will you tell us a story with gods
in the bath?

459
00:34:42,943 --> 00:34:44,349
Yes.

460
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:51,719
It's cold! It's cold!

461
00:34:51,821 --> 00:34:55,813
What's wrong with the heater?

462
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:15,215
When Isabelle came,
I was happy to be helpful,

463
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,972
but I failed.

464
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,211
You did the right thing.

465
00:35:29,814 --> 00:35:33,676
I called Mom to tell her Anna
would like to go on vacation there.

466
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,409
She had the nerve to tell me Isabelle
was back, and things were fine!

467
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:40,078
I didn't even react to that!

468
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:42,709
I said nothing, like an idiot!

469
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:47,203
How can I write a book
against all this hypocrisy?

470
00:35:47,316 --> 00:35:50,632
Marie, you confuse things.

471
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,317
Writing that book is a great idea.

472
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:56,101
You'll learn a lot.
You'll see.

473
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,399
Anna, wake up!

474
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:05,383
We're "Sundaying"
with Mom and Dad!

475
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:17,833
Hello, kids.
Did you sleep well?

476
00:36:18,032 --> 00:36:19,853
No "Sundaying" today?

477
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:21,674
Don't look so sad.

478
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:23,821
Today we'll show you
something important.

479
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:25,948
What?

480
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:28,499
Group solidarity.

481
00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:32,122
In Spain, some people
are facing death penalty.

482
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:36,174
So, we go out in the streets with
other people to show we disagree.

483
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:38,812
A family must stay together
on Sunday.

484
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:43,154
See, it's not a good idea
to take the kids to a demonstration.

485
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,348
No, it's fine.
They must learn.

486
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:46,538
Come sit down.

487
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:48,284
Learn what?

488
00:36:48,362 --> 00:36:50,466
For 15 years,
Quino and I fought together.

489
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,275
He died for nothing.

490
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:53,930
That's what I learned.

491
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:57,725
Marga, stop it!

492
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,472
Dad, what's group solidarity?

493
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:03,241
Franco is a murderer!

494
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,247
Franco is a murderer!

495
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:19,790
Franco is a Fascist!
Stop the Franquists!

496
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:21,412
Franco is a Fascist!

497
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,842
Franco is a Fascist!

498
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:32,729
Are you all right?
Did I hurt you?

499
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,444
No death penalty!

500
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:36,707
No death penalty!

501
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,765
You have to run!

502
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,800
Are you okay?

503
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,715
I want to pee.

504
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:01,105
Are you okay?
You're not hurt?

505
00:39:01,236 --> 00:39:03,145
I'm hungry.
I want to go home.

506
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,203
Me, me, me!

507
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:08,982
That was group solidarity!

508
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:10,930
We're here for your future!

509
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,659
My future?

510
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,618
When you're older,
you'll see that we were right.

511
00:39:15,715 --> 00:39:18,103
In Spain, they kill men like Quino
because of their ideas.

512
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:20,639
In Latin America,
the poor live in shacks!

513
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:23,297
I know we have to help the poor
and be polite to them,

514
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,433
but why do all that?

515
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,494
Let's do what Granny does!

516
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:30,990
Where does Granny fit in?

517
00:39:31,463 --> 00:39:33,700
Stop talking nonsense!

518
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:38,019
- Are you both okay?
- Fine.

519
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,084
My love.

520
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:44,366
Come in, Anna.

521
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,442
Then stay there!

522
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,246
Think about what I told you!

523
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,274
I won't!

524
00:39:52,396 --> 00:39:54,883
I'm glad I'm going
to Granny and Grandpa's!

525
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:57,424
They don't bother me
with group solidarity!

526
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,727
Anna, calm down!

527
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,587
I took the skin off.

528
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,766
Go on, eat!

529
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:34,406
You must be hungry.

530
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,622
Are things okay at school?

531
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:40,081
Yes, but it's hard to do homework
while sharing a room with François.

532
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:44,994
Oh, my dear,
that makes you even worthier.

533
00:40:46,388 --> 00:40:49,867
Granny, I'm not allowed
to take Bible study.

534
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:53,881
Your parents did that?

535
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:56,176
Hi, Anna.

536
00:41:01,776 --> 00:41:02,922
What is it?

537
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:04,658
Mom sewed it on for me.

538
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:06,451
Look.

539
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,973
I'm Anna de la Mesa.

540
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:10,307
I'm going to
Chateau de la Caussade.

541
00:41:10,463 --> 00:41:13,365
They made her travel all alone.

542
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:22,772
Is she sick? What's wrong?

543
00:41:28,004 --> 00:41:31,386
The Greek god of wine
was Dionysius.

544
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,027
You know what the Romans
called him?

545
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:33,789
No.

546
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:35,328
Bacchus.

547
00:41:35,443 --> 00:41:39,403
They told the same stories.
They just changed the names.

548
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,148
- Who came first?
- The Greeks.

549
00:41:42,242 --> 00:41:45,754
Then the Romans took their stories.

550
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:49,727
So that's why Panayota
says the Greeks did it all.

551
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,491
Even the beginning of the World.

552
00:41:52,584 --> 00:41:54,339
In what way?

553
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,797
The Bible says
God made everything in six days.

554
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:03,050
But Gaia and Uranos
were here before that.

555
00:42:03,142 --> 00:42:05,564
In Ancient times, people
believed all kinds of nonsense.

556
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,842
It was just stories
for ignorant people.

557
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:12,355
Look.

558
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,930
A fox got caught in this trap.

559
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:19,111
To be free, it gnawed off its paw.

560
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:31,504
We're taking all this
to the presbytery?

561
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:37,149
First we'll ask our help
if they want any of it.

562
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:41,283
The presbytery gives it
to orphans and the poor?

563
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:43,272
Why do you ask?

564
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,174
We've done this before.

565
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:54,864
Granny, do you think farmers
should share fields

566
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:58,065
among those who have lots
and those who have less?

567
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:00,587
Those are the ideas of your parents.

568
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:05,312
You think they're Communists?

569
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:09,984
Who are the Communists, Granny?

570
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:12,448
Students, workers,
people like everyone else.

571
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:14,554
But most of them are poor.

572
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:16,506
- What do they want?
- Everything!

573
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,601
Our houses, our vines,

574
00:43:18,706 --> 00:43:21,226
our clothes, our money,
and your toys.

575
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:22,425
Why?

576
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:25,001
I guess they don't like us.

577
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,134
They don't like us?

578
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:28,769
We give them milk, clothes,
we're polite to them,

579
00:43:28,865 --> 00:43:30,108
and they don't like us?

580
00:43:34,304 --> 00:43:36,408
What do you do next?

581
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:39,860
I leave it off,
until it gets really dark.

582
00:43:39,975 --> 00:43:42,079
Sometimes, I turn the heater off.

583
00:43:42,158 --> 00:43:46,947
Do you really think
it will change anything?

584
00:43:49,037 --> 00:43:53,260
You should find a spot for yourself.

585
00:44:56,787 --> 00:44:59,950
We're home.

586
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:07,073
Marie?

587
00:45:24,197 --> 00:45:26,618
Don't move!

588
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:29,113
Come, Anna.

589
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,710
Come here.

590
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:07,479
Anna, what are you doing?

591
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,809
This is a nice little spot.

592
00:46:14,598 --> 00:46:16,931
Not really.

593
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,346
So when can I come sleep over?

594
00:46:22,436 --> 00:46:25,534
You promised,
and my mom said yes.

595
00:46:25,636 --> 00:46:27,490
Well, okay.

596
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:31,473
Great, see you tomorrow!

597
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,084
Well...

598
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:38,746
- Are you alone?
- No.

599
00:46:42,617 --> 00:46:45,169
Hi, Anna!

600
00:46:45,976 --> 00:46:48,278
Mom, who is the Chinese lady?

601
00:46:56,526 --> 00:46:58,893
Anna, what did I tell you
this morning?

602
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:00,541
If the doors are closed,

603
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:03,085
I can't come in
because you're working!

604
00:47:03,189 --> 00:47:05,906
They come to tell me their lives.
It's hard for them.

605
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,712
Where is Panayota?

606
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:12,851
I forgot. I'm sorry.

607
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:15,631
Panayota went home to Greece.
Her husband got out of jail.

608
00:47:15,723 --> 00:47:18,090
Mai Lahn will be taking her place.

609
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,267
What's her name?

610
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:28,054
Mai Lahn is from Vietnam.
We talked about that country.

611
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:32,527
I know! It's where kids
are burnt with napalm.

612
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:34,283
I should have warned you.
I'm sorry.

613
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,694
But don't burst in on me!

614
00:47:36,784 --> 00:47:39,566
You said never to follow strangers!

615
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:46,181
You should have asked François.
He knows her.

616
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:57,928
Anna, you're disqualified.

617
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:00,051
It's a relay race.
You must pass the baton.

618
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,677
I can't believe it.

619
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,945
You have to comb her hair
before we leave.

620
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:18,008
Tell me the rest of the story.

621
00:48:18,097 --> 00:48:19,178
What story?

622
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:21,980
About the frog whose pool dried up.

623
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,690
It didn't want to die

624
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:26,028
and went to see
the Emperor of the Sky

625
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:27,835
to scold the Rain Genie.

626
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:30,495
- What's a Genie?
- He's like a God.

627
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:32,696
Are there other genies,
like the genie of wine?

628
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:35,708
Not of wine, but of the Sea,
of the Moon.

629
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:38,343
Is there a story
about how the world began?

630
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:39,332
Yes.

631
00:48:39,446 --> 00:48:41,104
Not that one! I know it!

632
00:48:41,206 --> 00:48:46,027
I heard it while you were on vacation.
I want the end of the frog story!

633
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:50,392
The frog doesn't want to die.

634
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:52,896
So it decides to go see
the Emperor of the Sky.

635
00:48:52,995 --> 00:48:53,627
What?

636
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:57,633
The Emperor of the Sky,
the boss of the Rain Genie.

637
00:48:57,842 --> 00:48:59,751
On the way...

638
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:02,402
- As it's going there?
- Yes.

639
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,124
It meets other animals.

640
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:11,782
A crab, a fox, a bear,
and last a little bee.

641
00:49:11,944 --> 00:49:15,774
The frog tells them
that if they'll come with it,

642
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:21,567
they'll have a better chance
of being heard.

643
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,541
So the animals decide
to go with the frog.

644
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,702
And they all leave together.

645
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:29,714
It worked because
they went as a group?

646
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:35,303
Yes, it worked
because they were numerous.

647
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:38,779
Who came first,
the Greeks or the Romans?

648
00:49:38,884 --> 00:49:40,193
Well, girls?

649
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:44,415
Who thinks the Romans came first?

650
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:52,766
Who else is for the Romans?

651
00:49:56,737 --> 00:49:58,744
Are you done?

652
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:04,154
Are you done?

653
00:50:05,856 --> 00:50:07,383
You're all wrong.

654
00:50:07,544 --> 00:50:10,413
I tried to be like the frog.
They all said the Romans.

655
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:13,169
So like the bear and the bee,
I went along.

656
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:14,448
Grandpa had told me.

657
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:18,957
I won't trust group solidarity again!

658
00:50:21,405 --> 00:50:24,634
I'm not sure I understand.

659
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:28,896
She confused group solidarity
with sheep behavior.

660
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,961
Am I right?

661
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:35,922
How can you tell sheep
from group solidarity?

662
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:39,512
You're never mistaken?

663
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:42,808
Hello.

664
00:50:42,898 --> 00:50:43,726
It's that way.

665
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,943
Another "whatness"!

666
00:50:48,065 --> 00:50:50,399
You mean witness.

667
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:55,757
Your dad and I are proud
that you tried group solidarity.

668
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:58,236
And I'm glad
you're inviting friends again.

669
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,798
Cecile is sleeping over.
I spoke to her mom.

670
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:07,038
Cecile is coming here?

671
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:10,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

672
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:21,285
I'll be right back.

673
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:39,271
- Hello.
- Hello.

674
00:51:46,463 --> 00:51:47,837
- Thanks a lot.
- Good-bye.

675
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:49,203
Good-bye.

676
00:51:49,366 --> 00:51:50,610
Where are you going, Mom?

677
00:51:50,702 --> 00:51:51,847
To Marga's.

678
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:54,284
Mai Lahn is staying
until Dad is back.

679
00:51:54,382 --> 00:51:55,429
See you later.

680
00:51:55,606 --> 00:51:57,231
See you later.

681
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:05,419
That's a lot of people
in such a tiny place.

682
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,962
- It's not tiny!
- It is compared to your old house.

683
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,801
Here, we don't have to be careful.
We do what we want!

684
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:14,646
But you have to share a room.

685
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,875
It's nicer with Anna.
I'm less scared.

686
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:19,954
Someone is always leaving
in our family.

687
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,228
And you don't have
a garden anymore!

688
00:52:23,337 --> 00:52:27,427
We go to the little park.
It's nice.

689
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,220
What's wrong with Cecile?

690
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,925
She saw Dad naked.
She'd never seen a dickie.

691
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:51,386
Sure, yours have been cut off.

692
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:53,594
No, they haven't.
We have duckies.

693
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:55,795
And what are duckies?

694
00:53:55,905 --> 00:53:58,011
Dickies that have been cut off!

695
00:53:58,122 --> 00:54:00,510
Shut up! I want to sleep!

696
00:54:23,405 --> 00:54:26,722
We need engineers.
They're important.

697
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:28,503
All the Americans will leave.

698
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:30,320
To hell with them.

699
00:54:30,444 --> 00:54:33,892
The Americans, sure,
but not the engineers.

700
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:37,026
Stronger towards them.

701
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,179
- That's the important thing.
- I can't believe it.

702
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:42,902
- Benito.
- Thank you.

703
00:54:47,425 --> 00:54:48,635
Anna?

704
00:54:48,729 --> 00:54:50,256
Are you okay?

705
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:51,979
Where are Mom and Dad?

706
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:55,350
Fernando went to get Marie
at your aunt's.

707
00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:59,031
Go back to bed.

708
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:03,523
Once you've nationalized,

709
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:05,859
the imperialist pigs will leave
and destroy everything.

710
00:55:05,974 --> 00:55:08,974
Right! That's why
we're looking for people here.

711
00:55:09,062 --> 00:55:11,647
I am afraid I will forget
what I need to ask them.

712
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:13,317
Stay here if you want.

713
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:23,162
You can't stop production.
You need that money.

714
00:55:24,268 --> 00:55:25,860
Anna!

715
00:55:32,586 --> 00:55:36,230
Are you sure
you don't want to go to bed?

716
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:41,974
You want something?
Some food?

717
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:02,399
Done.

718
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,061
Are you <i>barbudos?</i>

719
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:13,204
What do you know about them?

720
00:56:13,324 --> 00:56:17,065
They're Communists
who want nuclear war!

721
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:22,077
Granny says they want
to take our money and our house.

722
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:26,479
I see why Fernando
calls her a little mummy.

723
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:32,136
Look, I'll show you something.

724
00:56:32,281 --> 00:56:36,851
Imagine that all the wealth
of the world is an orange.

725
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:40,758
Some want to keep the orange
all to themselves,

726
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:43,749
once they've really peeled it.

727
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:48,393
And others want to divide it
in equal parts

728
00:56:48,982 --> 00:56:51,086
to share it.

729
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:57,460
Your father, your mother and us,
we're for sharing.

730
00:56:57,565 --> 00:57:01,011
So are the <i>barbudos.</i>

731
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:02,585
Taste it.

732
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,740
Taste it.

733
00:57:21,849 --> 00:57:23,092
This is the game.

734
00:57:23,217 --> 00:57:25,191
You buy a plate from me
for five francs.

735
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:27,175
What for?

736
00:57:27,255 --> 00:57:29,589
To resell it for 10 francs!

737
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:33,102
It's bad to make profits
and sell things for so much.

738
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,947
Then some people
can't buy anything.

739
00:57:36,062 --> 00:57:39,094
That's good.
That way you'll have money.

740
00:57:39,261 --> 00:57:41,879
Please buy something from me.

741
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:44,250
Why can't it be free?

742
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:12,574
We could swap things,
instead of always buying.

743
00:57:48,588 --> 00:57:51,173
Look, I take this.

744
00:57:51,283 --> 00:57:52,657
In exchange, I do you a favor.

745
00:57:52,755 --> 00:57:54,380
I could help with your homework.

746
00:57:54,475 --> 00:57:57,322
Hey, we're playing shop!

747
00:57:57,451 --> 00:58:00,036
I've already done my homework!

748
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:02,668
Mom!

749
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:04,460
Why aren't you in bed?
It's late.

750
00:58:04,553 --> 00:58:06,243
We tried to explain

751
00:58:06,346 --> 00:58:09,247
how to redistribute
wealth equitably, but...

752
00:58:09,441 --> 00:58:12,342
She wouldn't buy it.

753
00:58:12,872 --> 00:58:13,537
Go to bed!

754
00:58:13,648 --> 00:58:16,430
I think she wanted to talk to you.

755
00:58:16,528 --> 00:58:17,291
Really?

756
00:58:17,464 --> 00:58:20,878
She'd never seen a boy's dickie!

757
00:58:20,982 --> 00:58:24,844
Without a little brother, you would
have been like your friend Cecile.

758
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:27,958
Didn't Granny tell you about it?

759
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:31,403
Not even about the little seed?

760
00:58:31,524 --> 00:58:32,702
Not a chance!

761
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:35,382
Some parents don't tell their kids.

762
00:58:35,469 --> 00:58:37,159
Why?

763
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:41,046
Because some things can't be said?

764
00:58:41,146 --> 00:58:43,929
Who told you that?

765
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:48,799
Filomena and Granny.

766
00:58:49,962 --> 00:58:53,409
Is it better to say or not to say?

767
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:56,026
It's always better to talk.

768
00:58:56,104 --> 00:59:00,676
But that's not your problem.
You're a talker.

769
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:03,576
Go to bed!

770
00:59:03,696 --> 00:59:05,354
And be nice to your friend Cecile!

771
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:07,015
But she's not nice!

772
00:59:07,103 --> 00:59:08,564
She didn't like Mai Lahn's rice,

773
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:12,158
she says we have a tiny home,
and there's no garden!

774
00:59:12,263 --> 00:59:14,204
I know someone
who complains about everything,

775
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,935
who says that the park is dirty,

776
00:59:16,037 --> 00:59:18,307
and who turns the heating off
in mid-winter.

777
00:59:18,413 --> 00:59:21,446
Do you know her?

778
00:59:21,644 --> 00:59:23,237
No.

779
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,063
Come along.

780
00:59:27,076 --> 00:59:29,180
Miss de la Mesa.

781
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,371
Please.

782
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:36,963
Go wait in the study room.

783
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:41,972
- Are you okay?
- Leave me alone.

784
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:44,153
Starting today, girls,

785
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:48,029
we'll study the life
of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

786
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:10,207
I was born in France in 1949.

787
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:12,635
I'm the third of a family
of seven children.

788
01:00:12,757 --> 01:00:16,236
My father was a factory worker.
My mother was a housewife.

789
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:18,535
At the age of 16 and a half,
I worked in the factory.

790
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:22,929
I met a boy there,
and I got pregnant. That's it.

791
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:25,668
Don't try to tell your story
in chronological order,

792
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:27,362
or any kind of order.

793
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:29,546
Just say what comes to mind.

794
01:00:29,642 --> 01:00:33,797
If we want more details,
we will ask you a question.

795
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,376
Go on.

796
01:00:39,217 --> 01:00:42,565
I didn't make enough money
to raise my baby alone.

797
01:00:42,671 --> 01:00:46,282
He cried all the time.
I was exhausted.

798
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:48,496
Then he was put in a foster home.

799
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:50,662
I only saw him on Saturdays.

800
01:00:50,758 --> 01:00:53,408
I had a nervous breakdown,

801
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:57,276
and I was in a mental hospital
for 10 months.

802
01:00:57,397 --> 01:00:59,535
When I got out,
I wanted my son back,

803
01:00:59,637 --> 01:01:03,945
but they said I had to show
three months of salary.

804
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:07,352
So I got a job as a typist.

805
01:01:07,476 --> 01:01:10,377
But I can't spell at all.

806
01:01:10,539 --> 01:01:12,546
And I am a single mother.

807
01:01:12,642 --> 01:01:16,766
- So no "Sundaying"?
- Hush, let me listen.

808
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:20,645
I would have done anything to keep
my baby, even go back to the factory.

809
01:01:20,825 --> 01:01:24,436
Then May '68 came.
Anyone could go to college.

810
01:01:24,529 --> 01:01:28,270
I managed to work and study
at the same time.

811
01:01:28,376 --> 01:01:31,246
And I read books.

812
01:01:35,471 --> 01:01:38,154
Are you hungry?

813
01:01:43,813 --> 01:01:47,555
Dad, what's May '68?

814
01:01:49,709 --> 01:01:54,279
During the month of May, in 1968,

815
01:01:54,379 --> 01:01:57,226
people demonstrated
to change things.

816
01:01:57,306 --> 01:02:00,885
- To change what?
- Lots of things.

817
01:02:00,987 --> 01:02:03,834
A bit like what we're doing in Chile.

818
01:02:03,946 --> 01:02:05,985
Were you there, in May '68?

819
01:02:06,665 --> 01:02:09,251
I would have liked to,
but I had a job.

820
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:10,955
You saw nothing to change?

821
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:12,308
That's not it.

822
01:02:12,424 --> 01:02:15,358
Sometimes you miss out.
Then it's too late.

823
01:02:16,936 --> 01:02:19,587
There. It won't take long.

824
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:22,345
Are there things to change now?

825
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:24,950
Sure.

826
01:02:25,543 --> 01:02:28,674
There was Quino's death,
then Marga.

827
01:02:28,774 --> 01:02:32,832
We went to Chile,
Marie decided to write her book.

828
01:02:32,925 --> 01:02:35,162
So you were wrong, before?

829
01:02:35,325 --> 01:02:37,234
Not entirely.

830
01:02:37,325 --> 01:02:41,666
I have a beautiful family
with two beautiful kids.

831
01:02:41,779 --> 01:02:44,497
Stop! Stop! Stop!

832
01:02:44,612 --> 01:02:47,513
How can you be sure
you're not wrong now?

833
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:50,782
I'm not wrong.
I try to help others.

834
01:02:50,922 --> 01:02:54,239
Look, I need 10 minutes,
then my work's done.

835
01:02:55,986 --> 01:02:58,538
Is 10 minutes long?

836
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:02,577
Depends.
If you're busy, it goes fast.

837
01:03:11,183 --> 01:03:13,419
Quick, hide!
There's a policeman!

838
01:03:15,878 --> 01:03:17,853
Move over!

839
01:03:21,526 --> 01:03:25,136
Move your foot!

840
01:03:25,284 --> 01:03:28,764
If he comes close,
will he throw napalm on us?

841
01:03:28,893 --> 01:03:31,031
No, napalm is only used in wars!

842
01:03:31,132 --> 01:03:33,433
They torture with napalm
during "poontches"!

843
01:03:33,532 --> 01:03:34,676
But not kids!

844
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:37,594
Will he start a nuclear war?

845
01:03:37,723 --> 01:03:41,301
You're confusing everything.
The <i>barbudos</i> start nuclear wars!

846
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:43,540
Like Filomena said,
they're red and bearded.

847
01:03:43,633 --> 01:03:44,581
You got it all wrong!

848
01:03:44,674 --> 01:03:47,521
Santa Claus is red and bearded!

849
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:02,996
Let's play Allende and Franco.

850
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,624
I'll be Allende.
He's the good guy.

851
01:04:05,743 --> 01:04:08,109
So is Franco.
Dad's dad knew him.

852
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:10,004
He's bad in Pilar's song!

853
01:04:10,109 --> 01:04:11,932
What song?

854
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,769
Jesus was crucified
on Mount Golgotha,

855
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:27,021
in Jerusalem.

856
01:04:27,946 --> 01:04:30,434
- What do you do during Bible study?
- Nothing.

857
01:04:30,587 --> 01:04:32,342
- Don't you miss it?
- No.

858
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:35,359
What do you do with God,
Jesus and the Virgin Mary?

859
01:04:35,857 --> 01:04:37,002
Nothing.

860
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:39,009
I know why she skips Bible study.

861
01:04:39,113 --> 01:04:41,414
Her parents
have become "beatnik-hippy".

862
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:43,375
They don't have
a big house anymore.

863
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,261
They live in a tiny crowded place,
and they eat weird food.

864
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:47,553
It's not weird!

865
01:04:47,704 --> 01:04:50,736
Her parents go around naked.

866
01:04:50,903 --> 01:04:53,390
I won't invite you again!
You're an idiot!

867
01:04:53,518 --> 01:04:55,973
So stupid you've never seen
a boy's dickie!

868
01:05:00,717 --> 01:05:03,783
What's a boy's dickie like?

869
01:05:03,972 --> 01:05:05,795
She doesn't even know
how kids are made!

870
01:05:05,893 --> 01:05:06,558
Yes, I know!

871
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:07,960
Oh yeah? How?

872
01:05:08,109 --> 01:05:10,115
- I won't tell you!
- See, you don't know.

873
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:10,949
Yes, I do!

874
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:12,089
No, you don't!

875
01:05:12,259 --> 01:05:12,728
Yes!

876
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:13,248
No!

877
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:13,769
Yes!

878
01:05:13,892 --> 01:05:14,306
No!

879
01:05:14,395 --> 01:05:15,540
Yes!

880
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:28,088
What's a "beatnik-hippy"?

881
01:05:28,168 --> 01:05:30,818
I don't know.

882
01:05:32,601 --> 01:05:34,673
So how are babies made?

883
01:05:34,784 --> 01:05:37,117
Your parents never told you?

884
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:41,330
When I ask,
they pretend not to hear me.

885
01:05:41,423 --> 01:05:45,699
My parents do that too.
Especially my grandmother.

886
01:05:45,822 --> 01:05:47,032
Why is that?

887
01:05:47,189 --> 01:05:48,651
I don't know.

888
01:05:48,765 --> 01:05:52,627
My mom acts like a hen,
with her neck.

889
01:05:56,172 --> 01:06:00,100
So how are kids made?

890
01:06:03,003 --> 01:06:06,100
- What happened?
- Please, ladies.

891
01:06:06,202 --> 01:06:12,879
- This is a scandal!
- What are you talking about?

892
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,390
- You know what I mean!
- Not at all!

893
01:06:15,496 --> 01:06:19,686
I can't even discuss it!

894
01:06:19,793 --> 01:06:22,858
I'm leaving!

895
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,070
Come along.

896
01:06:32,733 --> 01:06:35,995
I want no sign of you for a while!
Scram!

897
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:48,315
How is your married life now?

898
01:06:48,411 --> 01:06:49,840
My life now?

899
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,509
In four years of marriage,

900
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:54,474
my husband has always
seen me pregnant.

901
01:06:54,563 --> 01:06:56,951
The kids are sick all the time.

902
01:06:57,074 --> 01:06:59,375
We're always short of money.

903
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:03,565
I'm often irritated and tired.

904
01:07:03,657 --> 01:07:05,664
I didn't want a fourth child.

905
01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:11,445
So every time he touched me,
I turned him down.

906
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,170
It's no life for him.

907
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:21,203
I asked my doctor for advice,
but he said I had marital duties.

908
00:57:47,357 --> 00:57:49,081
So every month I panicked.

909
01:07:24,589 --> 01:07:28,964
I checked endlessly for my period,
but got pregnant again.

910
01:07:29,117 --> 01:07:32,499
I wanted to get rid of it,
but I was afraid.

911
01:07:32,693 --> 01:07:36,008
I was told that they sewed
the fetus back on in the hospital,

912
01:07:36,107 --> 01:07:39,369
or that they did
a painful curettage to punish you.

913
01:07:40,771 --> 01:07:43,040
And I'm a Catholic.

914
01:07:54,026 --> 01:07:57,538
Faster! Faster!

915
01:08:00,151 --> 01:08:02,256
First! Great, Anna!

916
01:08:02,367 --> 01:08:04,506
We're done for today.

917
01:08:04,608 --> 01:08:08,633
Don't forget, there will be no class
during the Easter break.

918
01:08:21,732 --> 01:08:23,161
Hi, little mummy!

919
01:08:23,276 --> 01:08:25,130
- Well? You sold everything?
- Yeah.

920
01:08:25,228 --> 01:08:27,977
You're rich now.
You can help the poor.

921
01:08:32,843 --> 01:08:34,697
Hello.
How are you?

922
01:08:34,786 --> 01:08:37,568
Hello.
How are you?

923
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:42,271
Mom?

924
01:08:42,361 --> 01:08:44,247
Are you okay?

925
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:46,215
Hello.
How are you?

926
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,401
Hello.
How are you?

927
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:49,927
Hello.
How are you?

928
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:52,535
Hello.
How are you?

929
01:08:52,703 --> 01:08:54,612
- Hello.
- Hello.

930
01:08:55,639 --> 01:08:57,363
Hello, Miss.

931
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:01,805
Hello, Emilio.

932
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:03,876
Hi, little mummy.
How are you?

933
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:05,836
Will you help us win the elections?

934
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:08,575
I don't know.

935
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,206
Dad?

936
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:15,934
Dad, I thought Allende
had already won.

937
01:09:16,036 --> 01:09:17,661
Yes, that's right.

938
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:19,853
Excuse me.

939
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:23,271
But if the people aren't happy,
they can change things.

940
01:09:23,395 --> 01:09:26,972
So, there are various elections.
These are municipal.

941
01:09:27,073 --> 01:09:29,178
If he loses, will Franco win?

942
01:09:29,257 --> 01:09:31,112
Of course not!

943
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,055
But he'll win, don't worry.

944
01:09:40,775 --> 01:09:42,401
Hello.
How are you?

945
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,845
Hello.
Fine, thanks. And you?

946
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:46,341
Fine.

947
01:09:46,454 --> 01:09:48,276
You speak French well.

948
01:09:48,374 --> 01:09:50,763
You never talk to me when we meet.

949
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:53,723
That's true.

950
01:09:54,533 --> 01:09:55,678
Is your school nice?

951
01:09:56,244 --> 01:09:58,382
It's okay, but Mom wants me
to be the best.

952
01:09:58,492 --> 01:10:00,085
Cat!

953
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:25,089
François gets it wrong!
He says "Ay Camellia, Ay Camellia"!

954
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:28,078
It's not Camellia.
It's "Ay, Carmela! Ay, Carmela"!

955
01:10:28,192 --> 01:10:29,620
I knew it.

956
01:10:29,735 --> 01:10:31,012
Bedtime!

957
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:33,265
Come! Tomorrow you have school.

958
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:34,985
And the election results?

959
01:10:35,095 --> 01:10:37,461
We'll know tomorrow morning.
Five minutes more.

960
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:39,437
We're leaving.

961
01:10:59,387 --> 01:11:00,793
Mom.

962
01:11:18,471 --> 01:11:20,861
- How much did he say?
- I don't know.

963
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:23,396
Don't you speak Spanish?

964
01:11:31,486 --> 01:11:33,874
You're our good luck charm,
our mascot.

965
01:11:33,997 --> 01:11:37,063
See? Things always end well.

966
01:11:37,165 --> 01:11:41,058
<i>From the deep crucible</i>
<i>Of our homeland</i>

967
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:44,992
<i>The people's voices rise up</i>

968
01:11:45,082 --> 01:11:49,043
<i>We sense a new day is dawning</i>

969
01:11:49,163 --> 01:11:52,806
<i>All Chile is starting to sing</i>

970
01:11:52,897 --> 01:11:56,759
<i>We shall prevail</i>
<i>We shall prevail</i>

971
01:11:56,873 --> 01:12:00,669
<i>Though a thousand chains</i>
<i>We must break</i>

972
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,655
<i>We shall prevail</i>
<i>We shall prevail</i>

973
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:08,621
<i>Poverty will be overcome</i>

974
01:12:08,735 --> 01:12:12,663
<i>We shall prevail</i>
<i>We shall prevail</i>

975
01:12:12,759 --> 01:12:16,555
<i>Though a thousand chains</i>
<i>We must break</i>

976
01:12:16,678 --> 01:12:20,354
<i>We shall prevail</i>
<i>We shall prevail</i>

977
01:12:20,437 --> 01:12:23,853
<i>Poverty will be overcome</i>

978
01:12:23,853 --> 01:12:24,998
<i>Poverty will be overcome</i>

979
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:41,078
Explain this!

980
01:12:45,185 --> 01:12:47,519
How could you do this to me?

981
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:49,544
On a day like this!

982
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:51,999
I signed a petition.

983
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:13,368
343 French women
dare admit they had an abortion.

984
01:13:14,164 --> 01:13:15,823
Everyone will talk about this.

985
01:13:16,004 --> 01:13:18,240
That bothers you?

986
01:13:18,332 --> 01:13:21,146
Everything's fine!
We won the elections!

987
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:23,144
It's illegal!

988
01:13:23,251 --> 01:13:24,942
You know the 1920 law?

989
01:13:25,123 --> 01:13:28,384
Over 300 signed.
They can't touch us!

990
01:13:28,882 --> 01:13:31,270
You said I'd learn things
writing this book.

991
01:13:31,394 --> 01:13:33,369
You never had an abortion!

992
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,701
We needed to be
as numerous as possible.

993
01:13:35,785 --> 01:13:36,646
That's it!

994
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:38,556
It's group solidarity.

995
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:40,451
Precisely! That's what it is.

996
01:13:47,527 --> 01:13:50,691
Abortion.
That's what Isabelle did?

997
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:59,731
Abortion is when a woman
decides not to stay pregnant,

998
01:13:59,838 --> 01:14:03,895
because she can't or doesn't want
to have a child at that moment.

999
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:05,892
It's her choice, you see?

1000
01:14:14,346 --> 01:14:16,385
What's this macho act?

1001
01:14:16,506 --> 01:14:18,394
Don't you start, like Marga!

1002
01:14:18,475 --> 01:14:20,841
Leave Marga out of it.
At least she fought!

1003
01:14:20,954 --> 01:14:23,987
Your pro-Franco family
is your burden.

1004
01:14:24,073 --> 01:14:25,055
What burden?

1005
01:14:25,217 --> 01:14:26,265
How about yours?

1006
01:14:26,393 --> 01:14:27,800
You preach woman's liberation,

1007
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:30,670
and you let nuns and Granny
raise your daughter!

1008
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,687
As for Isabelle...

1009
01:14:31,776 --> 01:14:35,038
Deal with your own guilt,
but let me do my thing!

1010
01:14:35,144 --> 01:14:37,794
- As usual, you confuse everything.
- No, you do!

1011
01:14:37,919 --> 01:14:41,213
You fight for a country that is
miles away, that isn't yours!

1012
01:14:41,302 --> 01:14:44,117
- Odd way to make amends.
- For what?

1013
01:14:45,278 --> 01:14:46,293
For doing nothing

1014
01:14:46,397 --> 01:14:48,818
when Quino and Marga
risked their life in your country!

1015
01:14:48,893 --> 01:14:52,886
For fleeing here rather than choosing
between your sister and your parents!

1016
01:14:53,053 --> 01:14:55,191
You sneaked back once to see Marga,

1017
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:56,982
and once to introduce Anna
to her grandparents.

1018
01:14:57,108 --> 01:14:59,660
I worked for my family.
And for you!

1019
01:14:59,747 --> 01:15:03,130
You thought it was exotic
to marry a Spaniard,

1020
01:15:03,235 --> 01:15:05,307
as long as it didn't upset your world!

1021
01:15:05,426 --> 01:15:07,433
My family backed Franco,

1022
01:15:07,585 --> 01:15:10,433
but you didn't mind
until Marga came!

1023
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:14,024
<i>The counter attack is raging</i>

1024
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,863
<i>We must resist</i>

1025
01:15:16,977 --> 01:15:20,272
<i>Ay, Carmela</i>
<i>Ay, Carmela</i>

1026
01:15:20,352 --> 01:15:22,043
<i>We must resist</i>

1027
01:15:22,152 --> 01:15:23,526
<i>Ay, Carmela</i>

1028
01:04:47,317 --> 01:15:24,887


1029
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:25,934
Who taught you that?

1030
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:27,372
You're both out to get me!

1031
01:15:27,446 --> 01:15:29,302
Let go of her!

1032
01:15:29,423 --> 01:15:31,178
What's gotten into you?

1033
01:15:31,286 --> 01:15:33,293
What is it?
You scared her!

1034
01:15:33,422 --> 01:15:37,316
You should have told me you were
going to sign that manifesto.

1035
01:16:37,363 --> 01:16:39,949
Can we stop now?

1036
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:36,992
Chile

1037
01:18:43,582 --> 01:18:45,143
Are you okay?

1038
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:47,448
What are you doing?

1039
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:51,161
Watching the clock.
Ten minutes is long here.

1040
01:18:54,213 --> 01:18:55,555
"The king was pleased.

1041
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:57,245
Thinking it over,

1042
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:01,161
he approved of men
being responsible for what they ate.

1043
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:04,131
After punishing him,
he said to the fisherman:

1044
01:19:04,219 --> 01:19:07,567
'Give a man a fish,
you feed him for a day.

1045
01:05:49,671 --> 01:19:10,883
Teach a man to fish and
you feed him for a lifetime.

1046
01:19:10,883 --> 01:19:13,184
Then the King disappeared."

1047
01:19:16,457 --> 01:19:20,035
Can we go home now?

1048
01:19:29,976 --> 01:19:32,975
I'm hungry!

1049
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:29,159
Here.

1050
01:20:29,253 --> 01:20:33,596
Are you sure?
It won't be a fun trip.

1051
01:20:41,092 --> 01:20:43,033
Where did you get this?

1052
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:45,343
In the library.

1053
01:20:45,435 --> 01:20:48,631
Where's your house?

1054
01:20:51,562 --> 01:20:54,115
You lived in the countryside,
like Mom?

1055
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:58,323
It was more like a desert.

1056
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:08,071
Long ago, my ancestors
tortured people on tables.

1057
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,104
That's how we got our name.

1058
01:24:10,193 --> 01:24:11,818
"Mesa" is Spanish for "table."

1059
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:14,350
They tortured them
in the house where you went?

1060
01:24:14,465 --> 01:24:15,741
No.

1061
01:24:15,825 --> 01:24:18,279
I don't know, maybe.
It's so sad.

1062
01:24:18,384 --> 01:24:21,678
Miss de la Mesa.
Repeat what I said.

1063
01:24:21,767 --> 01:24:24,135
"The goat was eaten
by the wolf for disobeying."

1064
01:24:24,247 --> 01:24:26,156
Sit down.

1065
01:24:26,247 --> 01:24:29,955
Getting eaten by the wolf
was its punishment.

1066
01:24:30,062 --> 01:24:32,745
So the text is about
the need for obedience.

1067
01:24:32,861 --> 01:24:34,235
Sister, I don't get it.

1068
01:24:34,326 --> 01:24:37,456
My grandpa showed me
the paw of a fox caught in a trap.

1069
01:24:37,549 --> 01:24:40,069
It gnawed off its paw to get free.

1070
01:24:40,164 --> 01:24:42,019
That's quite different.

1071
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:45,555
The goat wasn't trapped.
Mr. Seguin fed it, loved it.

1072
01:24:45,652 --> 01:24:48,847
But he kept it tied up.
It's in the book.

1073
01:24:49,011 --> 01:24:51,880
Are you saying
the goat wanted to die?

1074
01:24:51,979 --> 01:24:53,123
That would be a sin.

1075
01:24:53,283 --> 01:24:54,111
Sit down.

1076
01:24:54,218 --> 01:24:56,803
Animals aren't Catholic, Sister.

1077
01:24:57,601 --> 01:24:59,968
What do you think it says?

1078
01:25:00,081 --> 01:25:02,699
The goat has two options:

1079
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:05,639
To stay at Mr. Seguin's
or escape to the mountains.

1080
01:25:05,727 --> 01:25:08,062
It leaves,
thinking the wolf won't eat it.

1081
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,566
Stand up to speak!

1082
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:13,508
It goes up to the mountains,
hoping to become free.

1083
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,795
Well, it was mistaken.
And so are you.

1084
01:25:15,919 --> 01:25:16,966
Sit down.

1085
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:20,380
I'll get a bad grade
and lose my bonus points.

1086
01:25:20,477 --> 01:25:23,772
We think you were right.
Trust us.

1087
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:26,536
You also say Snow White
and Mickey Mouse are fascists.

1088
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:28,701
And the Americans, and napalm!

1089
01:25:28,788 --> 01:25:31,406
You make mistakes, like Dad did.

1090
01:25:31,507 --> 01:25:33,100
He said he did.

1091
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:36,310
Yes, sometimes we're wrong.
So is your teacher.

1092
01:25:36,411 --> 01:25:39,444
So, no one's really sure
about anything?

1093
01:25:39,571 --> 01:25:41,228
What do you think?

1094
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:45,127
Were you wrong about the goat?

1095
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:46,700
Are you sure?

1096
01:25:46,793 --> 01:25:47,360
Yes.

1097
01:25:47,457 --> 01:25:48,984
You see.

1098
01:25:49,088 --> 01:25:51,510
I'm hungry.
Can we eat?

1099
01:25:51,617 --> 01:25:54,234
Yes, come help me.

1100
01:25:55,504 --> 01:25:58,121
Is that why you want
to change schools?

1101
01:25:58,224 --> 01:26:00,329
You won't see
your friend Cecile anymore.

1102
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:03,742
It doesn't matter.
It's like changing nannies.

1103
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:05,292
How?

1104
01:26:06,126 --> 01:26:07,532
It's sad when they leave,

1105
01:26:07,605 --> 01:26:12,013
but if the next one is nice,
it's okay.

1106
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:18,452
Thanks.

1107
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:21,407
Here we are!

1108
01:26:23,955 --> 01:26:26,857
It's like "Sundaying" on Wednesday!

1109
01:26:26,963 --> 01:26:28,817
Exactly!

1110
01:26:28,915 --> 01:26:30,027
Pasta!

1111
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:31,829
Yes!

1112
01:16:58,606 --> 01:16:59,053
Wait, put this here.
