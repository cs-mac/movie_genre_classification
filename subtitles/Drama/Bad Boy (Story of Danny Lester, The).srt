Bad Guy

00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:05,125
Episode 16

3
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:07,712
Enjoy:)

4
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:10,788
To tell you the truth,

5
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:16,304
the Haeshin Group mistook the young
Shim Gun Wook as Hong Tae Seong.

6
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:20,385
So when it was discovered that things
went wrong after he was adopted,

7
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:23,905
the Haeshin Group cast
him aside immediately.

8
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:27,327
Are you saying he was thrown out?

9
00:00:27,447 --> 00:00:29,736
The scar on his back was
from that time, too.

10
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:32,698
Also, Choi Seon Young.

11
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:36,513
Even she died because of Hong Tae Seong.

12
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:41,960
Then that woman was...

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,282
He probably didn't want
that family living in peace.

14
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:49,778
Nothing has been confirmed for sure,
so let's not give up on him.

15
00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:55,014
<i>They, who treat others worse than insects
because of their worthless pride...</i>

16
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:57,331
<i>The ones who cover themselves
with a mask called Haeshin...</i>

17
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:00,063
<i>I'll crush them all.</i>

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,585
Gun Wook...

19
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:12,280
<i>Gun Wook...</i>

20
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:13,691
Gun Wook...

21
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:18,832
<i>I thought you said you trust me.</i>

22
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:20,490
Then trust me until the very end.

23
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,491
Gun Wook...

24
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:22,669
<i>No matter what happens.</i>

25
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:24,510
<i>Gun Wook!</i>

26
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:26,985
<i>Gun Wook!</i>

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,646
Who exactly keeps sending me this?

28
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,800
Who?

29
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:48,780
You must've been upset that I'm alive,
even though you thought I was dead.

30
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:52,049
<i>Why do you fear me so much?</i>

31
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:54,067
You must be feeling uneasy...

32
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:58,433
thinking I might become a part
of your family again.

33
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:01,810
You're playing around with me
even after your death?

34
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,328
Evil bastard.

35
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:09,254
Do you think I'd fall for your tricks?

36
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:10,758
Me?

37
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:20,679
<i>Shim Gun Wook...</i>

38
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,711
<i>There were a lot of patients
in the E.R. that day,</i>

39
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:27,918
but I didn't treat any patients who
were involved in a car accident.

40
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,463
What do you mean by that, Dr. Kim?

41
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,503
You were doing the E.R. shift that night.

42
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:36,375
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:38,539
I told you to call me if there
were any patients in critical condition...

44
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,411
since I was going out to eat.

45
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:44,401
Oh, yeah. One of my colleagues
happened to visit me on that day,

46
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:46,233
so I definitely remember.

47
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:52,125
You came into the E.R. just in time,
so I thought you didn't go out to eat.

48
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:55,897
Nurse Baek, even though you
haven't worked here for that long,

49
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:58,047
can't you even recognize my face?

50
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:01,726
He wore glasses and had short hair...

51
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,488
<i>I'm sure it was you.</i>

52
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:07,604
Please show me the list of patients.

53
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:09,737
Here, I've had it prepared.

54
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:12,374
Is this not your signature?

55
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:17,239
This isn't my signature.

56
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:19,633
<i>What happened?</i>

57
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,611
<i>Doctor's name: Kim Seong Jin</i>

58
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:38,548
Yes, detective?

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,620
Have you found Gun Wook yet?

60
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,788
No. I haven't found him yet.

61
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,627
Aside from that,

62
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:49,082
was there anything...

63
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:52,903
weird about Shim Gun Wook lately?

64
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:55,700
<i>Because I don't think
this was a simple car accident.</i>

65
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,613
Maybe someone had intentions
to harm Shim Gun Wook, or...

66
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:03,434
Someone's trying to harm Gun Wook?

67
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:08,380
Have you heard anything
about Shim Gun Wook...

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,603
from Hong Tae Seong, or
Shin Myung Won from the gallery?

69
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:17,650
It seems like Shin Myung Won
knows who Shim Gun Wook is.

70
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,305
Then there's a chance that...

71
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,451
the people from Haeshin...

72
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:28,364
I'm not suspecting them of anything, but...

73
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:31,347
I'm just being open to all the possibilities
for the purpose of this investigation.

74
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,725
What's for sure is that...

75
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:38,881
someone intentionally erased all traces
of Shim Gun Wook.

76
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:41,803
<i>I sent him on a vacation.</i>

77
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,090
What brings you here?

78
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,881
Where did you...
send Gun Wook on vacation?

79
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,122
Why do I have to tell you that?

80
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,147
Did Gun Wook really go on vacation?

81
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:05,795
Maybe you don't know where he is.

82
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:07,268
What is it that you want to say to me?

83
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:09,724
It's been over a week since
Gun Wook disappeared,

84
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:12,931
but you lied to me about
sending him on vacation, and...

85
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,095
Tae Seong won't even try to look for him.

86
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:18,971
Did you conspire against Gun Wook?
To rid this planet of him?

87
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:24,664
Why do you concern yourself
about Gun Wook so much?

88
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:27,263
Because he's an important person to me.

89
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:28,997
An important person?

90
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:31,253
What is Tae Seong to you then?

91
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,708
We're not talking about
Tae Seong right now, though.

92
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,795
Let's stop this.

93
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:40,373
What...
did you do with Gun Wook?

94
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,427
Why do you think that I
did something to him?

95
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:45,038
If anyone's going to look for him, it's me.

96
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:47,188
When it comes to worrying about him,
I worry about him more.

97
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:48,584
You know...

98
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:52,589
who Gun Wook is, right?

99
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:53,433
What did you say?

100
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,379
The child that your family
threw out 20 years ago.

101
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,650
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

102
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:01,428
What do you mean, "the child
that my family threw out 20 years ago"?

103
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:03,576
This is the first time I've heard of that.

104
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:08,478
You're not pretending you don't know about
something even I know about, right?

105
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,133
It's our family affair.

106
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,986
I don't think you're in a position
to be involved in our family affairs yet.

107
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:20,098
Please leave my room.
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

108
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,934
They say Gun Wook...

109
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:28,149
died.

110
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:36,478
<i>They don't even know where Gun Wook
is right now after he was in an accident.</i>

111
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:39,026
Whether he was really
admitted to some hospital, or...

112
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,570
He couldn't have...

113
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,690
Gun Wook's ID was found with a dead body...

114
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,693
that was transported from a car accident.

115
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:52,690
I don't know what happened after that.

116
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,554
No way...

117
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:04,525
If...

118
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:12,094
it was Haeshin that did something...
knowing who he was...

119
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,992
Then I definitely won't stay
quiet about this.

120
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:30,028
<i>Oh, you're here, ma'am?</i>

121
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:31,274
<i>The Director is in, right?</i>

122
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:33,683
She's having a meeting inside
the room right now.

123
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:37,765
This is the second time,
Department Head Kim.

124
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:41,417
Why did something that was thrown
away appear in front of me a second time?

125
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:44,849
That is something I also do not know about.

126
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,304
Why wasn't I able to call you last night?

127
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:49,518
Are you sure you weren't meeting
with Shim Gun Wook or something?

128
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,850
I even put myself in the
face of danger to help you,

129
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,533
so are you trying to throw me out
using false accusations now?

130
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,543
Are you threatening me?

131
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:01,167
<i>I'm sure you told me it
would be the last time, and...</i>

132
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:03,454
<i>that's why I took care of the
matter without leaving a single trace.</i>

133
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:05,372
It was for Haeshin,

134
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:08,325
but also because things would be
troublesome for me if I made any mistakes.

135
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:12,032
It'll only make things difficult
for Haeshin if you suffer.

136
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:15,797
Do you think I would want that?

137
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,710
I have also protected this
company for 30 years.

138
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:21,184
Fine.

139
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,238
Was there anyone else who
saw him on the day of the accident?

140
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:29,504
Or was there anyone else who helped you?

141
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,886
<i>I made sure not to leave any
traces behind as best I could.</i>

142
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:37,541
<i>I even took care of the car
from the accident.</i>

143
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:40,211
He's dead.

144
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,343
Then I'll be leaving.

145
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:52,231
Department Head Kim. Where is Shim Gun Wook?

146
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,363
<i>Tae Ra, you. Talk with me.</i>

147
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:56,836
Department Head Kim, leave.

148
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,598
Please don't leave and answer my question.

149
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:01,992
Where is Shim Gun Wook?

150
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:04,614
Tae Ra, you. Why are you doing this at work?

151
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,394
<i>Are you still looking for him?</i>

152
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:08,281
Mom.

153
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:11,642
They say Shim Gun Wook died.

154
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:13,212
What?

155
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:17,907
<i>You seem surprised.</i>

156
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:20,071
That accident you were talking about.

157
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:22,480
You were talking about Gun Wook's accident,
weren't you?

158
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,854
What do you mean he died of an accident?

159
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:27,558
Don't pretend you don't know.

160
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:29,230
<i>You were the one who told me.</i>

161
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,519
That Gun Wook died.

162
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,711
Did I say that?

163
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:35,777
I can't even remember.

164
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:38,877
Tae Ra, are you going to find faults
in the things I said while I was angry?

165
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:42,069
Bastards like him could be
rid of using just a couple of cents.

166
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,895
<i>Are you going to hurt my feelings like that?</i>

167
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:47,215
Is that the kind of person
you thought of me as all this while?

168
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,921
Am I really wrong?

169
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:58,176
Do you really have nothing to do
with that matter?

170
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:04,641
One of the chairman's favorite employees
had a car accident not too long ago.

171
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:09,520
Since Chairman Hong was unconscious,
Madam Shin was trying to help him.

172
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,290
But where did you hear about his death?

173
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,024
Is he really dead?

174
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:21,621
Is that important right now?

175
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:24,337
He was punished by God.
He deserved to die.

176
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,976
<i>Did he think he'd be safe
after ruining our family like this?</i>

177
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:28,189
Mom.

178
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,804
How can you say that when someone has died?

179
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:34,548
It's not just anyone,
but someone who once called you Mother.

180
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,883
How could you...

181
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,591
I'm just saying that because
what he did was despicable.

182
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:41,383
Please stop.

183
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,504
How did she find out?

184
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:51,413
It seems like she sent her secretary
to the hospital to find out.

185
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:55,173
There is a record of his death, so it would
have been possible for her to find out.

186
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:56,508
Is that so?

187
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,178
It looks like it was taken care of well.

188
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:01,904
Take your leave, Department Head Kim.

189
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:03,024
Yes, ma'am.

190
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:35,239
<i>~ I take a step back ~</i>

191
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,850
<i>Into the place seemingly close,
but unreachable</i>

192
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,759
<i>Even if your name that I couldn't call out</i>

193
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,130
<i>hits my chest and it bruises</i>

194
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,140
<i>I'm sorry for being someone like this</i>

195
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:10,280
<i>for not being able to get close to you</i>

196
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,320
<i>I love you</i>

197
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,855
<i>Shim Gun Wook...</i>

198
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:19,235
<i>you're really "that" Tae Seong?</i>

199
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,990
<i>Even though I still cry alone today</i>

200
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:37,175
Jae In.

201
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,874
<i>Miss Hong Mo Ne sent this
to you from the U.S.</i>

202
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:42,255
Alright.

203
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,707
Ah, that's a lot.

204
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,528
- Make them order lots.
- Yes.

205
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:02,967
And spend less money on the vegetables.

206
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:10,371
Aside from that, Gun Wook
hasn't called at all...

207
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,903
What happened to him?

208
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:24,457
Hello?

209
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:28,212
This is Jang Seung from
the "Family Bulgogi" restaurant.

210
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:29,409
Who?

211
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,125
I'll send you a text if your hearing's bad.

212
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,121
- I'm kidding.
- Who the heck is this...

213
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:36,993
<i>The reason I've called you is because...</i>

214
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:39,019
I just can't seem to contact Gun Wook.

215
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:41,781
I told you to call me when
you find Gun Wook.

216
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:44,175
When did I tell you to call me
and ask where he is?

217
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,848
Well...

218
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:49,193
Hel-

219
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,187
I guess being a jackass is hereditary.

220
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,314
Do you know how to drive?

221
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,717
Do you want to drink coffee?

222
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,344
No. I'm fine.

223
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,855
Do I just keep going this way?

224
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:26,236
Turn left h-

225
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:35,302
I also hate it when others
touch me when I'm driving.

226
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:37,880
It's the same for me. I'm sorry.

227
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:44,033
I told you before, right?

228
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,821
That I had an officetel that I don't use.

229
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:51,394
How was that car from earlier?

230
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,746
Was it comfortable?

231
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:56,447
Have it.

232
00:14:56,969 --> 00:14:58,979
The car and this officetel too.

233
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:00,314
What?

234
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:06,097
I was thinking, and I realized
I haven't done anything for you.

235
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,177
<i>Mission complete...</i>

236
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,930
or actually no.

237
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:17,089
There are a lot of things
I want to do for you.

238
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,723
Let's eat together with your
mother next time.

239
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:23,102
I want to give her something good, too.

240
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,158
To give me these things all of a sudden...

241
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:29,139
I don't want them.

242
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,996
I can't take gifts like these.

243
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:32,806
Why?

244
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,771
Why can't you take them?

245
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,267
You know you've been acting
a bit strange lately?

246
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:42,891
You look like you're out of it,
and you won't pick up my calls either.

247
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:44,288
Tae Seong.

248
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:46,161
Is it because of Shim Gun Wook?

249
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,154
Jae In.

250
00:15:49,752 --> 00:15:51,762
Why do you care about him so much?

251
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,890
Do you know about Gun Wook?

252
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,591
You've had him by your side for a long time.

253
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:00,110
I do know something about him.

254
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,867
I know that he was trying to take
over Haeshin by manipulating Tae Ra.

255
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,871
Is that all you really think about Gun Wook?

256
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,395
Then how am I supposed to think about him?

257
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:18,109
It's not just Tae Ra, but Mo Ne and I
were manipulated by him, too.

258
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:19,797
Gun Wook is...

259
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,401
a person who used to be in your place.

260
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,831
<i>He's the Hong Tae Seong who was
kicked out of your family 20 years ago.</i>

261
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:30,611
<i>A person who used to be in your place.</i>

262
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:34,739
Just now...

263
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:40,691
What did you say?

264
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:49,648
I mean, Jae In...

265
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:52,549
<i>What are you talking about right now?</i>

266
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,375
It doesn't make any sense.

267
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,891
<i>How can Shim Gun Wook be that child?</i>

268
00:16:57,846 --> 00:17:00,715
And, Jae In... how do you know about that?

269
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:03,232
I...

270
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,930
I don't understand a word you're saying.

271
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:25,392
<i>The person who Choi Seon Young
fought with in front of the officetel,</i>

272
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:29,551
<i>perhaps it was the person who was
adopted and disowned before you...</i>

273
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:33,108
<i>were adopted into the Haeshin
household as a child.</i>

274
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:35,947
<i>So this is the place you've
come to while carrying her suicide note?</i>

275
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,935
Because of you... a woman has died.

276
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:41,435
Are you afraid because I'm telling you to
kill me while standing in front of you?

277
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:42,693
<i>Are you scared?</i>

278
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,893
<i>Shim Gun Wook.</i>

279
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,010
<i>You're like my brother sometimes.</i>

280
00:17:59,038 --> 00:17:59,882
Hey, Tae Seong.

281
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:03,249
Keep that up just until I finish this ice cream.
Try to act like you're my older brother.

282
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:05,075
<i>I'm not raising any little brothers.</i>

283
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:09,081
I have no intention of being an older brother,
and humans are supposed to live and die alone.

284
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:28,883
It's a butterfly.

285
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,825
Father, you remember, don't you?

286
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:53,002
The one who came before me...

287
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,535
I hear that he's Shim Gun Wook.

288
00:18:58,422 --> 00:18:59,420
That guy...

289
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:03,726
after losing his place as your son to me,

290
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,225
he also lost his place next to Seon Young.

291
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,612
But he still took care of me.

292
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:15,896
He's funny, isn't he?

293
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,622
Why didn't he ask me for a fight?

294
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,897
Or just seriously kill me instead?

295
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:25,997
What are you playing at, Shim Gun Wook?

296
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:31,924
<i>You're here.</i>

297
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,054
Did you know about it?

298
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,878
<i>What was it that he wanted?</i>

299
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,690
Because he missed his family...

300
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,237
from the household that kicked him out...

301
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:45,892
Whatever it is, I'm not interested.

302
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:48,086
Why aren't you interested?

303
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,891
He even manipulated you.

304
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:52,364
What do you know?

305
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,774
It's not something you should
concern yourself with.

306
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,600
Aren't I your little brother?

307
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:57,457
<i>Answer me.</i>

308
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,304
Do you love him?

309
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,997
That's right.

310
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:08,220
I still love him.

311
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:11,375
Even if he approached me with
the intention of getting his revenge,

312
00:20:11,495 --> 00:20:15,641
or tried to take over Haeshin,
I love him regardless.

313
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:19,822
But the one I love...

314
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,492
is gone without a trace,

315
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:25,668
and I don't know if he's dead or alive.

316
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:31,316
How do you think I feel right now?

317
00:20:34,753 --> 00:20:37,224
If he's alive, at least...

318
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:41,444
I don't care about anything else.

319
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,318
Father!

320
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:54,804
<i>Father!</i>

321
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:57,611
- Father!
- Father!

322
00:20:57,718 --> 00:20:58,823
<i>Father!</i>

323
00:20:58,992 --> 00:20:59,820
Father!

324
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:03,288
<i>Father...</i>

325
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,650
<i>Even if your name that I couldn't call out</i>

326
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:20,419
<i>hits my chest and it bruises</i>

327
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:27,779
<i>I'm sorry for being someone like this</i>

328
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:35,640
<i>for not being able to get close to you</i>

329
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,600
<i>I love you</i>

330
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,905
<i>Because I wasn't able to
say that one phrase</i>

331
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:41,995
<i>Jae In.</i>

332
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,210
<i>I cry alone sometimes</i>

333
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,910
<i>I'm a truly pathetic person</i>

334
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:04,769
<i>After I reach the end of the world</i>

335
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:11,130
<i>without finding a single excuse for myself</i>

336
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,880
<i>I'll probably regret while looking back</i>

337
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,150
<i>I'm sorry for being someone like this</i>

338
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,731
<i>Gun Wook.</i>

339
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:30,181
You should hurry home.

340
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:32,038
Where are you?

341
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,395
You're going to come back for sure, right?

342
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,707
I'll be waiting for you, so...

343
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:45,083
you have to come back for sure.

344
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:48,336
Alright?

345
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:51,739
Honey.

346
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:54,716
Please don't worry about anything,

347
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:57,539
since I'll take care of everything.

348
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,393
You can just stay relaxed.

349
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:05,777
Tae Ra is going to become
Chairman in your place...

350
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,522
and Tae Ra and I will protect our Haeshin.

351
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:15,076
I even removed him from our sight,

352
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:17,501
so who else would I support
in becoming the next Chairman?

353
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:18,974
Tae Seong?

354
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:24,969
Surely I'll be able to stop people like him?

355
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:28,652
How dare they set their eyes on our Haeshin.

356
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:33,224
Let's go to your room now.

357
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:35,004
It's time to sleep.

358
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,397
Mom.

359
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:04,102
He's dead! Dead!

360
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:06,512
Even Tae Ra said so. That he's dead!

361
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,372
Manager Eun!

362
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:17,999
<i>Manager Eun!</i>

363
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:20,807
He's dead! Dead!

364
00:24:21,075 --> 00:24:22,103
Madam.

365
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:25,541
I've become too agitated.

366
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:27,091
Why am I like this?

367
00:24:29,254 --> 00:24:30,635
<i>Madam.</i>

368
00:24:45,324 --> 00:24:46,751
<i>What happened to Shim Gun Wook?</i>

369
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,301
What about the list of the deceased?

370
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:49,007
<i>Yes.</i>

371
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:52,689
<i>I've looked through all the hospitals within
downtown Seoul and the city limits.</i>

372
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:55,881
There weren't any patients
admitted with the name Shim Gun Wook.

373
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:58,014
And there were no deceased by that name, either.

374
00:24:58,812 --> 00:24:59,840
Are you positive?

375
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,715
Yes.

376
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:02,280
<i>Vice-chairman.</i>

377
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:04,725
<i>This is a delivery that was just
sent to your n-</i>

378
00:25:04,845 --> 00:25:06,075
Alright. You can leave now.

379
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,030
<i>Shim Gun Wook...</i>

380
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:41,802
<i>Do you think I'll leave him
alone after what he's done to me?</i>

381
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:45,117
<i>It's something that has to be done,
no matter who does it.</i>

382
00:25:48,036 --> 00:25:50,230
<i>Why? Are you scared?</i>

383
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,177
<i>I'm not a patient person.</i>

384
00:25:53,297 --> 00:25:54,512
<i>Keep in mind...</i>

385
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,980
<i>that this is the last chance for you,
Department Head Kim.</i>

386
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:05,177
<i>Why? Are you scared?</i>

387
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:07,664
<i>I'm not a patient person.</i>

388
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:09,015
<i>Keep in mind...</i>

389
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,734
Shim Gun Wook.

390
00:26:17,854 --> 00:26:19,683
Shim Gun Wook. Shim Gun Wook.

391
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:26,036
Search all the hospitals that are out there.

392
00:26:26,156 --> 00:26:27,557
He's not dead.

393
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:28,493
Shim Gun Wook.

394
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:31,348
No. He might've been admitted
under a different name.

395
00:26:31,468 --> 00:26:34,233
Hong Tae Seong, Choi Tae Seong.
Whatever the name is.

396
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,519
Use all means possible to find him!

397
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:46,444
Director, Director Yoon has come to visit.

398
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,734
Oh my. Welcome, Director Yoon.

399
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:54,711
Have you been well, Madam?

400
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:55,815
Yes.

401
00:26:55,935 --> 00:26:59,992
Everyone's talking about the upcoming election
for the new Chairman of the Board, right?

402
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:09,127
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

403
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:10,416
Mom...

404
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:14,191
<i>He was more resilient and
scarier than when he was young.</i>

405
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:17,352
<i>And yet you unknowingly protected him.</i>

406
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:21,736
You killed him after all?

407
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:55,916
[Letter of Resignation]

408
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:00,013
Jae In, what's the matter all of a sudden?

409
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:01,490
<i>Jae In.</i>

410
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:07,106
Yes, detective.

411
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:08,400
Pardon?

412
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,101
You found Gun Wook?

413
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:12,451
Yes.

414
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:22,746
Oh. You're here, Tae Ra?

415
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:24,557
It's good that you're here.

416
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:28,179
I needed to talk to you about
the special meeting of Directors.

417
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:32,630
<i>Shim Gun Wook...</i>

418
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,144
<i>Do you think I'll leave him
alone after what he's done to me?</i>

419
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:38,553
<i>It's something that has to be done,
no matter who does it.</i>

420
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:42,019
Where exactly did you get this?

421
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:43,922
Mom, did you really...

422
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,868
kill Gun Wook or something?

423
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:51,441
I'm really tired of hearing
the name Shim Gun Wook.

424
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:53,865
Why would I kill someone like that? Why?

425
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:55,369
Then what is this recording?

426
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:57,717
What exactly have you done to Gun Wook?

427
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,359
I don't know.

428
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:04,089
The special meeting of Directors
is tomorrow.

429
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,201
That's when the new Chairman of the
Haeshin Group will be elected!

430
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:11,893
It seems like most of the directors
want Tae Seong as the new Chairman.

431
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:14,932
That's not what I'm asking you right now.

432
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,387
Did you order Department Head Kim to do it?

433
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,627
<i>To kill him.</i>

434
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:21,267
I'm right, aren't I?

435
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:30,751
You're not giving me an answer,
so that must mean I'm right.

436
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:33,237
Why on earth...

437
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,444
Why would you...

438
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:39,942
I told him to remove that bastard.

439
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:41,375
<i>From my sight.</i>

440
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:43,754
Are you satisfied now?

441
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:49,896
How could you kill someone who was once
Father's son and my little brother? How?

442
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:53,545
I didn't kill him.
Who says I killed him?

443
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:57,022
I just meant that he's a tenacious bastard
I wouldn't care for even if he died.

444
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,055
Do you still want to trust him even
after you've been tricked like that?

445
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:06,657
I am the one who feels the most anger,
hatred, and fury because of him!

446
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:11,506
I am the one who lost the most
because of him.

447
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:16,623
Two of my siblings, my father...
and my family was broken apart.

448
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:20,306
So please,

449
00:30:20,828 --> 00:30:22,730
please let him go.

450
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:30,273
Tae Ra.

451
00:30:31,577 --> 00:30:33,741
How could you still be so tender?

452
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,472
<i>Don't concern yourself with
things like that.</i>

453
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:39,054
What is most important for us?

454
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:41,234
It's Haeshin. Haeshin!

455
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:43,704
Set your eyes on nothing else. Nothing else!

456
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,216
<i>I wanted to see you.</i>

457
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,774
<i>I wanted to see you.</i>

458
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:21,587
<i>I wanted to see you.</i>

459
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:22,922
<i>Where are you?</i>

460
00:31:23,597 --> 00:31:25,423
<i>Stop playing around and quickly come out.</i>

461
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:27,986
<i>It's fine even if you manipulate me.</i>

462
00:31:28,106 --> 00:31:30,909
<i>I don't even care if you despise
me enough to shiver in hatred.</i>

463
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:34,975
<i>Please show up in front of me right now.</i>

464
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,031
<i>Shim Gun Wook...</i>

465
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:39,594
<i>Please.</i>

466
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:42,245
<i>show up in front of me right now.</i>

467
00:31:44,378 --> 00:31:50,743
I was a bit late, checking security tapes to see
which direction the ambulance was headed.

468
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,860
Thank you.

469
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:55,699
Did they say Gun Wook was okay?

470
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,370
I think it's true that there
was an accident.

471
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:03,685
We'll have to meet him
to see how he's doing, but...

472
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:08,074
they say he was in a bad condition
when he was first wheeled in, so...

473
00:32:08,457 --> 00:32:11,923
prepare yourself.

474
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,067
Tae Seong.

475
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:24,507
<i>Tae Seong!
It's time to eat!</i>

476
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:27,300
<i>Oh, be careful. You're going to fall over.</i>

477
00:32:52,742 --> 00:32:55,551
The one in charge of the site

I'm not sure.

483
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:50,668
I think she left after she heard
that Shim Gun Wook was found.

484
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:53,445
Shim Gun Wook... was found?

485
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:37,706
Gun Wook...

486
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,253
Yeah?

487
00:34:42,229 --> 00:34:44,332
You were hiding here.

488
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:47,830
You were alive.

489
00:34:48,858 --> 00:34:49,626
Yeah.

490
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,372
Were you resting because you were tired?

491
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:55,998
Yeah.

492
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:32,530
Why didn't you tell me
you were having a hard time?

493
00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:37,513
I could've lent you my shoulder...

Huh? It won't write.

495
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:08,784
Why are you doing this, Gun Wook?

496
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,470
The pen won't write.

497
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,002
It's a black pen, but it won't write.

Why are you crying, Mom?

501
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:51,959
Mom's not crying.

502
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,299
Oh my baby, Mom's not crying.

<i>About that male patient in room 312...</i>

505
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:31,926
Oh, the patient named Hong Tae Seong?

506
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:32,878
Hong Tae Seong?

507
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:35,601
Ah yes, he came in because
he was in a car accident.

508
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:39,637
He was bleeding quite a bit when he came in,
but he had no other problems.

509
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,488
He hurt his head, but his external
injuries weren't that bad.

510
00:37:44,025 --> 00:37:45,391
But why is he like that?

511
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:49,147
I think he's mentally impaired because of
an unknown psychological trauma.

512
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,922
That patient's guardian told me he'd
go through a thorough check-up,

513
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:55,024
and get treated at a bigger facility,

514
00:37:55,144 --> 00:37:58,543
so we're just taking care of him for now.

515
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:00,124
His guardian?

516
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,564
A young person sometimes comes to visit.

517
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:07,475
Could I get his or her contact information?

518

Don't be confused, Jae In.

525
00:38:58,409 --> 00:38:59,907
People tend to want to see and
miss others more...

526
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,405
when they suddenly disappear
from their sight.

527
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:06,566
Is it because you sympathize with Gun Wook?

528
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,270
Gun Wook...

529
00:39:09,787 --> 00:39:11,859
has hurt your feelings,

530
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:15,619
but I hurt Gun Wook's feelings.

531
00:39:17,874 --> 00:39:19,639
Gun Wook probably needs me.

532
00:39:21,598 --> 00:39:23,670
Did Shim Gun Wook tell you
that he needs you?

533
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:33,237
Why don't you know that it's all lies?

534
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:36,506
Do you want me to tell you why
Shim Gun Wook is doing this?

00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:48,624
Then what about me?

539
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:56,943
Are you telling me to go like this,

540
00:39:58,002 --> 00:39:59,859
without giving me a chance to
make you happy?

541

542

want to...

543
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,118
support Gun Wook from his side.

544
00:40:12,446 --> 00:40:14,042
I can't.

00:40:14,948 --> 00:40:17,203

I pushed her away. Seon Young, that is.

558
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:04,460
However, what Seon Young wanted
at that time was for me to hold onto her.

559
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:07,833

Why would Mo Ne give that
to him when she has her sister?

640
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:25,267
<i>Alright.</i>

641
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:28,628
This is definitely Director Hong Mo Ne's
Power of Attorney.

642
00:46:30,408 --> 00:46:31,850
<i>Then because of this,</i>

643
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,358
<i>with 15 votes against 16,</i>

644
00:46:34,478 --> 00:46:37,058
I announce that Executive Director
Hong Tae Seong...

645
00:46:37,178 --> 00:46:40,772
<i>has been elected as the Deputy
Chairman of the Haeshin Group.</i>

646
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,670
<i>No way!</i>

647
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,307
What is this nonsense!
What's the matter again?

648
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:54,374
Executive Director Hong Tae Seong is a person
with no right to be here in the first place!

649
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:57,397
Please calm yourself and have a seat,
Mother.

650
00:46:57,517 --> 00:47:00,590
I'm not interested in the position
of Chairman, or anything like that.

651
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,186
<i>Tae Seong, you...</i>

652
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:06,023
I don't know how you manipulated
Mo Ne, but...

653
00:47:06,143 --> 00:47:07,511
things will not turn out as
you want them to.

654
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:08,785
They'll never turn out as you want!

655
00:47:08,905 --> 00:47:10,918
Mom. Please stop it.

656
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:16,288
Madam Shin. Executive Director Hong
Tae Seong, as Chairman Hong's heir,

657
00:47:16,408 --> 00:47:20,646
not only has the rights to Chairman
Hong's shares, but his position...

658
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:22,561
That's assuming he's an heir.

659
00:47:25,883 --> 00:47:29,684
From the beginning, before everything else,
Executive Director Hong Tae Seong...

660
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:33,214
had neither the requirements
nor the rights to the inheritance.

661
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,676
<i>- What is this?
- What is she saying?</i>

662
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:39,129
Mother... I told you to stop it.

663
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:41,069
Mother?

664
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,672
You are not related to Chairman
Hong Jung Soo in any way whatsoever.

665
00:47:46,117 --> 00:47:47,330
<i>Huh, what?</i>

666
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,399
I'm saying you're not Chairman
Hong Jung Soo's real son.

667
00:47:58,013 --> 00:47:58,719
My...

668
00:47:59,866 --> 00:48:00,464

669
00:48:01,324 --> 00:48:02,076
My...

670
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:09,860
<i>Executive Director Hong Tae Seong shares not a
single drop of blood with Chairman Hong Jung Soo.</i>

671
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:17,631
<i>You can see this, right?</i>

672
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,743
You can see this, right?

673
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,413
<i>You can see this, right?</i>

674
00:48:27,828 --> 00:48:31,603
I prepared this in the event something
like this happened.

675
00:48:31,971 --> 00:48:34,380
Mother, you're really too much.

676
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:38,245
I was never interested in the position
of Chairman since the beginning.

677
00:48:38,365 --> 00:48:41,482
No matter what happened,
I was planning on giving it all to Tae Ra.

678
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:46,009
But...
you say I'm not my father's son?

679
00:48:46,129 --> 00:48:48,934
Then did you think I was lying?

680
00:48:50,116 --> 00:48:52,556
Mom, please stop it.
Tae Seong, you too.

681
00:48:53,093 --> 00:48:58,180
I'm sorry. Let's finish the special meeting
of Directors at this point in time...

682
00:48:58,441 --> 00:49:01,664
and I think it'd be a good idea
to discuss...

683
00:49:01,784 --> 00:49:03,597
the issue of electing a Deputy Chairman in
our next special meeting of Directors.

684
00:49:03,717 --> 00:49:06,481
<i>Then I conclude this meeting.</i>

[Results of Paternity DNA Test Analysis:
NOT A MATCH]

687
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,310
Then Mom...

688
00:49:35,614 --> 00:49:37,793
if Tae Seong isn't Father's real son...

689
00:49:37,913 --> 00:49:40,250
who's the real Tae Seong?

690
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:43,733
That child died.

691
00:49:45,743 --> 00:49:46,833
When?

692
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:50,377
20 years ago.

693
00:49:52,939 --> 00:49:54,090
What?

694
00:50:04,194 --> 00:50:06,281
<i>The real Tae Seong died?</i>

695
00:50:09,457 --> 00:50:12,649
Yeah, that's right.

696
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:15,641
After all the turmoil, your father looked
for the bastard child, but...

697
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:17,513
that was after he died.

698
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,797
I couldn't hurt your father twice.

699
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:25,665
You're saying it was one coincidence
after another?

700
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,353
This is all...

701
00:50:27,473 --> 00:50:29,409
because your father made the
mistake of having an affair.

702
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:33,542
In the end, you end up receiving the
consequences for the mistakes you make.

703
00:50:34,386 --> 00:50:36,381
Are you sure you're not the
one who gave him that consequence?

704
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:37,424
What?

705
00:50:37,544 --> 00:50:41,675
Didn't you intentionally bring in Tae Seong,
who was completely unrelated?

706
00:50:42,608 --> 00:50:43,974
Tae Ra, you...

707
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:46,092
What kind of a person do you think I am?

708
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:47,979
You're really selfish.

709
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:51,616
Don't you know how many people
are hurt and suffering because of you?

710
00:50:51,736 --> 00:50:53,522
If you lied to Father,

711
00:50:53,642 --> 00:50:57,236
you should have kept that secret
to your grave, why bring it up now?

712
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:01,225
Have you never considered
Tae Seong's feelings?

713
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:04,640
He doesn't share a drop of blood with me
and he's not my husband's child,

714
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,819
so why do I have to care for him?

715
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:10,594
I did everything I was supposed
to do already by raising him!

716
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:17,719
You've never truly loved
Tae Seong, though. Not once.

717
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,113
Everyone is born under different destinies.

718
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:22,092
His place is elsewhere.

719
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:24,045
Please stop it now.

720
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:26,071
Do you think he deserves to be
in our family?

721
00:51:26,547 --> 00:51:27,702
He lives his life like that,

722
00:51:27,822 --> 00:51:30,126
because we tried to put a misfit like him
into an unfitting lifestyle such as this.

723
00:51:32,183 --> 00:51:33,165
Tae Ra.

724
00:51:34,776 --> 00:51:38,946
You're someone who is soon to be
Chairman of the Haeshin Group.

725
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:42,199
Only think about how you
can move our Haeshin forward.

726
00:51:50,086 --> 00:51:53,186
How far do you have to go
until you're satisfied?

727
00:51:54,014 --> 00:51:57,912
You were the source that caused all
of this to happen to our family.

728
00:51:58,943 --> 00:52:01,122
I'm tired of it now.

729
00:52:01,444 --> 00:52:04,652
You... can have the position of Chairman.

730
00:52:06,554 --> 00:52:08,568
<i>You always told me, didn't you?</i>

731
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:10,762
That the position is yours.

732
00:52:35,492 --> 00:52:39,366
<i>You are not related to Chairman
Hong Jung Soo in any way whatsoever.</i>

733
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:43,678
<i>The workplace is not like school.</i>

734
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:45,335
<i>Think about what you should be doing!</i>

735
00:52:45,473 --> 00:52:50,188
<i>Try to understand what kind
of a place Haeshin is.</i>

736
00:52:51,492 --> 00:52:52,305
Father...

737
00:52:53,202 --> 00:52:54,399
Tae Seong, let's go in.

738
00:52:57,497 --> 00:52:59,100
<i>I'm saying you're not Chairman
Hong Jung Soo's real son.</i>

739
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:01,655
Who's the real Tae Seong?

740
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:03,312
He died.

741
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:09,250
<i>Because my thorn, that grows</i>

742
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:15,230
<i>day by day, hurts you</i>

743
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:20,940
<i>I try my best to hide my tears, but</i>

744
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:28,669
<i>They're exposed when I stand before you</i>

745
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:33,500
<i>Even though I painfully push you away</i>

746
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:39,220
<i>You're always at the same
place in my heart</i>

747
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:42,843
<i>I'm in front of your apartment.
Come out for a minute.</i>

748
00:53:43,242 --> 00:53:44,117
Who...

749
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:45,237
My little sister.

750
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:48,659
Jae In.

751
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,065
Thanks. I'll enjoy eating it.

752
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:04,760
<i>Because your scent still lingers in me</i>

753
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:10,270
<i>I cannot forget you yet</i>

754
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:16,000
<i>I can still feel your tears</i>

755
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:21,010
<i>I guess I'm still hurt that much</i>

756
00:54:21,865 --> 00:54:26,039
I'll make you lots of
tasty things when you're back.

757
00:54:27,409 --> 00:54:30,693
I'll bring lots of tasty things, so...

758
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:37,352
<i>make sure you come back.</i>

759
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,276
I don't care about the condition
that you're in.

760
00:54:41,396 --> 00:54:44,452
I don't care even if you laugh
like an idiot,

761
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,923
and I don't care even if you can't
recognize me, so...

762
00:54:47,043 --> 00:54:48,657
come back quickly.

763
00:54:51,685 --> 00:54:54,569
Let's eat together for sure this time.

764
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,899
<i>I guess my never-ending love for you</i>

765
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:09,030
<i>would not let me send you away yet</i>

766
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:16,926
What?

767
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,121
Shim Gun Wook is alive?

768
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:20,241
Where is he?

769
00:55:20,361 --> 00:55:21,922
<i>He was in a nursing home in Kangwon County.</i>

770
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:24,485
<i>He's been admitted under
the name Hong Tae Seong, too.</i>

771
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:28,582
But Madam, I think he's mentally ill.

772
00:55:28,702 --> 00:55:30,393
<i>I don't think he's normal right now.</i>

773
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:32,241
Should I just let him be?

774
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:33,238
No.

775
00:55:34,128 --> 00:55:36,737
What happens if he regains his sanity?

776
00:55:37,305 --> 00:55:40,558
The source of trouble should
be sliced away with a clean cut.

777
00:55:50,878 --> 00:55:51,799
<i>Father.</i>

778
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:56,066
I can call you Father, right? Even still...

779
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:59,519
<i>Why didn't she tell me a little bit later?</i>

780
00:55:59,933 --> 00:56:04,786
Anyway, Madam Shin and I catch
each other at the worst moments.

781
00:56:06,382 --> 00:56:08,653
Can't I be with you a bit longer?

782
00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:14,624
Father...

783
00:56:17,192 --> 00:56:23,094
we grew close to each other
while you raised me?

784
00:56:24,155 --> 00:56:26,631
I haven't done anything for you yet.

785
00:56:27,997 --> 00:56:30,176
<i>Do you still have something you want?</i>

786
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:34,503
<i>Uncle!</i>

787
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:43,529
So Dam, where have you been?

788
00:56:44,377 --> 00:56:45,221
A kiss?

789
00:56:46,893 --> 00:56:48,627
<i>Have you been listening to your mom?</i>

790
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,329
I finally understand...

791
00:56:52,805 --> 00:56:55,383
why you treated me so cruelly,

792
00:56:55,503 --> 00:56:58,487
why you gave me the cold shoulder.

793
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:01,909
Mother, I...

794
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,180
Don't call me Mother.

795
00:57:05,269 --> 00:57:08,500
You and I are completely unrelated.

796
00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:10,710
Mother.

797
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,605
Do you know why I didn't
go to my biological mother?

798
00:57:16,878 --> 00:57:18,459
I bet it was the money.

799
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:22,869
No.

800
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:29,523
Because the two of you at least
didn't throw me away.

801
00:57:31,902 --> 00:57:37,050
So I thought there would
be a day I'd repay that favor.

802
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,481
I told myself I would, even if I
were to leave.

803
00:57:39,601 --> 00:57:43,207
But...
it seems like I can't even do that now.

804
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:50,742
I have no reason to feel sorry for you.

805
00:57:51,156 --> 00:57:54,233
We gave you the best lifestyle
you could have ever had.

806
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:00,130
I'm sorry, Mother.

807
00:58:02,892 --> 00:58:07,481
I didn't even realize that you
raised me all this while, and...

808
00:58:10,663 --> 00:58:12,673
I only got angry all time.

809
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:16,356
I should've been better to you much earlier.

810
00:58:19,921 --> 00:58:22,775
I knew from the moment
I first came into this house.

811
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:28,238
That no one loved me.

812
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:31,133
That no one accepted me as a part
of the family.

813
00:58:32,645 --> 00:58:36,301
I waited, thinking it was hard
for everyone...

814
00:58:36,421 --> 00:58:41,086
to open up their hearts again
after the boy before me left, but...

815
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:48,521
if I'd known back then that everyone
couldn't love me...

816
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:53,524
it actually would've been easier for me.

817
00:58:57,346 --> 00:58:59,478
Your father loved you.

818
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:08,007
Those words are...

819
00:59:10,662 --> 00:59:13,669
the most kind, among all the things
you've ever said, Mother.

820
00:59:24,077 --> 00:59:25,289
I'll be off.

834
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:16,413
Don't sympathize with me.

835
01:00:17,257 --> 01:00:18,822
I really hate that.

836
01:00:18,942 --> 01:00:20,247
It's nothing like that.

837
01:00:20,723 --> 01:00:21,889
Eat before you go.

838
01:00:22,196 --> 01:00:23,255
See?

839
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,449
You're sympathizing with me already.

840
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,842
I should cut my ties...

841
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,495
and go my own way now.

842
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:41,070
I'm going.

Where are you going?

846

Can't I go with you?

What?

848
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,179
You're going to meet Shim Gun Wook,
aren't you?

I also have a lot of things to
talk about with him.

Father.

851
01:02:33,894 --> 01:02:36,718
I've left my seat empty for too long.

852
01:02:38,164 --> 01:02:42,461
I'll get it back soon and give it
to Tae Ra or Mo Ne.

853
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,949
It would've been nice if Tae Gyun
were here too.

854
01:02:53,573 --> 01:02:55,967
As you always used to say,

01:02:56,087 --> 01:03:02,047
"If you can achieve something great, then
don't think about how the process may be. "
