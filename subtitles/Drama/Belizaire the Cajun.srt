1
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,125
Avoid the occasions of sin.
For your penance,

2
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,028
say the rosary 5 times.
Now make an Act of Contrition.

3
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,026
Five rosaries?

4
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,604
Father, I have never in my life
had to say 3 rosaries,

5
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,644
let alone 5. 1, 2...

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,436
Belizaire!

7
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,079
The penance comes from God.
It's not something you negotiate.

8
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,375
Now make an Act of Contrition.

9
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,159
Belizaire! Belizaire!

10
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,400
The medicine you gave me
for my shoulder really helped.

11
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,525
Do you have any more?

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,805
Yes, I do, I have one bottle left.
That's promised to Madame Maraist.

13
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,676
I could make some more, but...

14
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,614
I'm gonna be on my knees all day
saying those 5 rosaries.

15
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,081
Belizaire. Belizaire.

16
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,650
The penance comes from God,
I only exercise...

17
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,382
a slight discretion
in determining what it is.

18
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,119
My power to heal
comes from God directly...

19
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,622
and I have a great deal of discretion.

20
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,722
If I had 1 rosary, I might have time
to make medicine for your shoulder.

21
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,525
Belizaire. Belizaire.

22
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,861
Think of the Bishop. He doesn't
understand these country parishes.

23
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,404
If he heard us negotiating,
you know what he'd do to me?

24
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,703
Ooh... Maybe you should talk
to the Bishop about your shoulder.

25
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,908
Belizaire!

26
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,514
(cough)

27
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,627
<i>Bless you.</i>

28
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,744
Mr. Belizaire!

29
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,527
My Mama's sick.

30
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,232
Sickness that foretells what's coming.

31
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,233
She said you'd know about it.

32
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,646
Hey, Dolsin.

33
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,235
Chew on that.

34
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,405
Well, you don't have the sunstroke.

35
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,183
And you don't have the moonstroke.

36
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,420
You're gonna have another boy, Alida.

37
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,824
Sometime between Christmas
and the New Year, I believe.

38
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,555
Morning sickness near sundown.

39
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,459
- But I always was a little contr...
- Contrary.

40
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,735
I'll leave citronelle and red raspberry.
That ought to make you fine.

41
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,865
Thank you.

42
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,374
Promise... Promise not to tell anybody.

43
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,272
Why?

44
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,085
Well, I can keep a secret...

45
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,953
Alida, Matthew's gotta act right by you.
No matter what his papa says.

46
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,121
It's good of you to care.

47
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,554
I do care.

48
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,100
I care much more
than you know, Alida.

49
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,672
Ah, Belizaire.

50
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,840
No wonder I hear such stories about you.

51
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,880
- What stories?
- What stories? You know...

52
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,745
the Widow Comeaux...

53
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,250
The Widow Comeaux?

54
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,317
She'd marry my mule if he'd have her.

55
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,853
Belizaire!

56
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,791
(horse whinnies)

57
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,655
That's Matthew.

58
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,733
- Meaux, get that for me, will ya?
- Try not to take too long in there.

59
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,598
<i>HEY"
HEY"</i>

60
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,063
- How you doing, partner?
- Fine

61
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:41,611
- I'll give you this milk and stuff.
- I'll tend to your horse.

62
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,712
Take that for me, would you?

63
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,042
Here you go.

64
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,779
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Daddy.

65
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,754
I brought you a little something.

66
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:52,920
Promise me.

67
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,687
Don't tell Matthew about the baby.

68
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,250
(Sigh)

69
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,997
Hey, darling.

70
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,835
How are you?

71
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,969
What's that? What? Matthew?

72
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,477
A little something special.
Something special for you.

73
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,074
Sounds like pecans.

74
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,349
It is pecans.

75
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,854
- That horse doctor here?
- I wasn't feeling well.

76
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,657
What you doing here?

77
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,767
As one with power to heal,
Matthew, I have the good fortune...

78
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,828
...to enter any home I please.

79
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,942
- I sensed a little stress in the belly...
- A little bellyache.

80
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,036
I suggested red raspberry and citronelle.

81
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,836
Herbs to calm my stomach.

82
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,906
People today barely respect
our Acadian ways,

83
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,750
but when one they love falls ill,

84
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:01,952
- they always come back to me.
- Thank you, Mr. Belizaire, we'll be just fine.

85
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,088
Alright.

86
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,189
Matthew, please.

87
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,826
Leave him be.
I didn't feel Well, that's all.

88
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
Matthew!

89
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,003
What the hell are you doing?

90
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,703
This is to knock the pain out
of your house, Matthew.

91
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:24,339
Thank you but I don't need the pain knocked
out of my house. Appreciate that.

92
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,439
You've got snakes.

93
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,451
Get away from here.

94
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,996
Don't you come around here again.

95
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,292
You aren't needed around here.

96
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:50,100
I don't wanna see you here again.
You hear me, Mr. Belizaire Breaux?

97
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,412
You castin' gris-gris spells?

98
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,475
Gris-gris is for evil, Mr. Willoughby.

99
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,815
A man like you might have use for that.
But my powers are to heal.

100
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,955
We had a Santo Domingo slave
who dealt magic. We sold her off.

101
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:12,888
Gris-gris...

102
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,359
Ooh... Don't put no curse on me, Belizaire!

103
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,773
Matthew!
Hurry up in there!

104
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,243
Hey, I have to go out again tonight.

105
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,719
Again, Matthew?

106
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,187
No more "again."
The meetings are finished.

107
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:46,955
Tonight we ride.

108
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,497
(horses galloping)

109
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:16,916
Hypolite Leger!

110
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:19,995
What's that?

111
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,688
Hypolite Leger!

112
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,638
What you men come here for?

113
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,709
Leger, you will undergo an infamous
punishment because...

114
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,373
you have taken part in crimes
that have desolated this country for years.

115
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,879
No longer having faith in our juries,

116
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:45,483
mauled by sheriffs who keep away
honest men from the jurors bench,

117
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,080
we have formed ourselves into juries.

118
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,892
You are found guilty of theft and barnburning.

119
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,820
You must leave this State in 2 weeks...

120
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,929
I didn't do it. I don't want trouble.

121
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,598
If you break this bond, you
will be hanged. Let's go!

122
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,502
Felix Nunez!

123
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,774
Felix Nunez!

124
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,980
You must leave the State in 2 weeks.

125
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,141
Go elsewhere and seek a living
by work and morality.

126
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,383
If you break this bond,
you will be hanged.

127
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,620
<i>Let's gm!</i>

128
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,422
Hurry up, Belizaire!

129
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,762
Hurry up!

130
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,394
Hell, slow down, 'Polite.

131
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,876
Get down, get down, get down.

132
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,436
They coming for you too, Belizaire.

133
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,384
- They didn't come for you.
- I guess they come for me later.

134
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,010
We gotta warn Parrain.

135
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,994
Came to my house.
Nothing about the Sheriff.

136
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,290
Just said I have to go.

137
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,432
They said I did things I didn't do.
I didn't do it!

138
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,631
They gonna come and
get you too, Parrain.

139
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,099
They gonna come and get you.

140
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,765
- I didn't do nothing.
- You didn't mention the Sheriff?

141
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,100
They said I have to leave.

142
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,743
- Wake up in there!
- Wayne Plaisance!

143
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,351
Wayne Plaisance!

144
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,853
You will undergo
an infamous punishment...

145
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,787
- for taking part in crimes...
- Get out! Just get out!

146
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,520
Hey. get back. Hey!

147
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,391
Come on!

148
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,367
That's Belizaire Breaux.

149
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,471
We can get rid of him, too.
Right, Matthew?

150
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,404
That's enough. Just read.

151
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:45,939
Just read it!

152
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,575
No longer having faith in our juries,

153
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,207
...mauled by sheriffs
who keep away honest men...

154
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:57,276
...from the jurors bench,
we have formed ourselves into juries...

155
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:26,116
I found Dolsin trying to get into
your gun closet today, Matthew.

156
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,079
Well...

157
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,114
He can't get past the lock.

158
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
I know.

159
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,189
But he was trying.

160
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,889
He sees you practicing
and now he wants to shoot.

161
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,496
He needs more of you
than that, Matthew.

162
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,899
This vigilante business
won't take long.

163
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,613
Then the slave auctions in
New Orleans and the spring round-up.

164
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,750
That won't take long either?

165
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,858
My father needs me.

166
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,454
I know.

167
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,167
But your children, darling...

168
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,837
Your children need you, too.

169
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,136
I need you.

170
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,719
Don't forget, Matthew.

171
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,421
I'm scared.

172
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,356
My sweet...

173
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,701
My sweet Matthew.

174
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:00,032
We been here long before they was.
They can't make us go.

175
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,906
The dozen richest men in the Parish!
What can we do?

176
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,376
Know what I'm gonna do?

177
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:09,713
Smoke as much beef for the trail
as I can lay my hands on.

178
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,953
Maybe the Sheriff can do something.

179
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,721
Ha!

180
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,159
I'm not leaving.

181
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,255
I've lived here all my life.

182
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,126
I'm gonna stay here.

183
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,265
(horses galloping)

184
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,305
Here they come!

185
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,991
Be careful, Father.

186
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,621
Stay here with your wife.
This is no place for a woman.

187
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,859
- Meaux can stay with her.
- You stay with Rebecca.

188
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,002
When are you gonna talk about
giving us some protection?

189
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,907
Sosthene, you get the same kind
of protection you always have.

190
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,673
I might as well leave for Texas.

191
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,048
It's the big man with all his men behind him.

192
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,444
He wants to increase his land.

193
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,084
Sheriff, throw this one out.

194
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,457
We don't want your land.

195
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,891
I'm gonna stay right here, this is
my home. I ain't going to Texas.

196
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,329
I'm gonna say it again.
I belong right here!

197
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,557
I've called you men in here...

198
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,864
...to save you from getting into
serious trouble.

199
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,369
Twenty families you've exiled.
That's too many.

200
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,639
Pick five. Five of the worst.

201
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,576
And I'll personally
see to it that they leave.

202
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,346
No need for you gentlemen
to dirty your hands.

203
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,519
No, Sheriff, five is not enough.

204
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,952
Wait, I wasn't finished.

205
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,487
You pick five, I pick five...

206
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,523
From that list of 20
that you nominated last night.

207
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,694
For those who stay behind,
they will behave or I'll lock 'em up.

208
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,037
(humming)

209
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,314
Papa told you
never to come back here.

210
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,973
Dolsin? Oh my goodness!

211
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,285
Papa told you
never to come back here.

212
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,114
Dolsin! Stop!
Dolsin!

213
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,115
Dolsin! I don't ever want
to see you do that again.

214
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,858
Papa told him not to come
around here no more.

215
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,625
Go to your room.

216
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,663
Now!

217
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,528
Quick, Dolsin.

218
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,005
- I'm sorry, Belizaire.
- Ah, well.

219
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,414
I brought you more citronelle.

220
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,408
Thank you.

221
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,749
I want to thank you.

222
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,856
- For keeping my secret yesterday.
- Oh well.

223
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,559
I always know what to say, don't I.

224
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,523
Matthew, well...

225
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,566
...he gets mad when he's jealous.

226
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,737
But it doesn't hurt him to get
jealous every now and then, does it?

227
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,476
It's not jealousy that makes him
and his rich friends...

228
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,638
terrorize these common people,
is it?

229
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,741
He should make his committee realize,
that you by familial obligation...

230
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,150
...you're still beholden to your...

231
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,847
Let's talk about
something else, alright?

232
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,518
These people are given 2 weeks
to pack up and leave forever.

233
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:40,960
I've heard enough about the
vigilantes lately. That's enough.

234
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,179
Peep, peep, peep, peep.
Come eat.

235
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,081
Peep, peep, peep. Come eat.

236
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,489
Saturday I'll be playing my accordion
at that fais do-do dance.

237
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,259
If they still hold one.

238
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,063
Peep, peep, peep...

239
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:21,366
<i>Oh, Madame Sosthene,
bring me Alida.</i>

240
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:26,739
<i>She's the one I have loved,
since I was 14 years old.</i>

241
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:32,508
<i>If she don't consent,
I will steal her away...</i>

242
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,721
Oh, you used to come
to that fais do-do.

243
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,879
You used to be the best dancer
on this bayou.

244
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,584
- No, not the best.
- One of the best. - No.

245
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,795
All the boys would ask you to dance.

246
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,465
And we'd watch you
as we waited our turns.

247
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,839
That was before I met Matthew.

248
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,933
He changed you.

249
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,277
Everybody knows he didn't
even bother to marry you.

250
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,349
Belizaire Breaux!

251
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,983
- You are telling me this?
- I am.

252
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,824
Well at least me and Matthew,
we jumped the broomstick.

253
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,830
That was fine when
there was no church...

254
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,364
...with a priest now it's inexcusable.

255
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,628
If it's good enough for my mother,
it's good enough for me.

256
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,166
If I had a woman like you,
I'd marry her in a minute.

257
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,872
And I'd marry her
in the Holy Mother Church.

258
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,705
If you're gonna talk like that,
you're gonna have to leave.

259
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,143
But first, I'll pay you for yesterday.
And today, too.

260
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,722
There's no charge.

261
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:52,326
These were medical visits,
no matter what...

262
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,926
...nonsense you talk.

263
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,829
I'm talking nonsense today?

264
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,705
Pecans. They're sweet.

265
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,102
Here. Take them.

266
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,179
They come from
Matthew's papa's yard.

267
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,147
Maybe you should talk to Matthew.

268
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,791
Or his papa.

269
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,747
(whistling)

270
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,689
'Polite been by here?

271
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,128
Tell your cousin there's
no more credit around here.

272
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,221
Come join the game.

273
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,834
'Polite will be by in a while.
You can win enough to pay his bill.

274
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,232
I do have enough
to pay his bill today.

275
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,806
No more barter!
I have to be gone in <i>2</i> weeks!

276
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,236
Maybe then we can start
raising chickens again.

277
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,279
(laughing)

278
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,947
Since everything that's not nailed down
around here seems to be yours.

279
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:24,918
(laughing)

280
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,557
I have enough of being accused
for something that's not my fault!

281
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,893
Deal me in there.

282
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,032
(cows moo)

283
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,940
This is your plantation, Son.

284
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,775
What about Rebecca's portion?

285
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,652
Matthew will take care of his sister.
Go tend to the cattle, James.

286
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,553
If it wasn't for his vigilante committee,

287
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,956
I'd be done with the round-up by now.

288
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,294
If you'd take the opportunities...

289
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,192
James!

290
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,962
James! Later!

291
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,556
Want me to break
that funny looking nose of yours?

292
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,194
You're very brave
on the other side of a fence.

293
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,196
(cows moo)

294
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,576
You say you've run it for 10 years...

295
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:26,139
Your son wants to be an Indian or a Cajun.
That's his life.

296
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:31,085
He thinks he can make friends
with these people and that...

297
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,145
- James!
- They will at the same time respect him.

298
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,747
- James.
- But he's not one of them. Never will be.

299
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,886
Ever thought of shutting up
once in a while?

300
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,126
It'll take someone
as strong and as hard as you.

301
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,596
I know he's your son
but Matthew is <i>as</i> soft as Louisiana mud.

302
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,377
But my son will run this plantation.

303
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,355
I told you not to come
around my house Belizaire Breaux.

304
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,858
Well, Alida needed medicine, Matthew.

305
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,790
For what malady?
She doesn't seem sick.

306
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,795
I gave those pecans to Alida.

307
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,561
She paid me with them.

308
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,637
Tell me then. What is her illness?

309
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:23,866
Huh?

310
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,236
The female trouble.

311
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,106
Sounds like the male trouble to me.

312
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,338
- You should be ashamed, Matthew.
- Of what?

313
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,145
You come here and accuse Alida.

314
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,812
I'm not accusing her.
I'm accusing you!

315
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,249
What you gonna do to me?

316
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,619
Even your vigilantes aren't gonna do
nothing to a man as innocent as me.

317
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,731
I think I will have you
brought before the committee.

318
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,496
Don't bring your vigilantes into this.

319
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,159
He'll give you back the pecans.

320
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,799
No, Alida gave me these
as a payment.

321
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,465
Put the pecans in the sack.

322
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,205
I didn't know they was stolen.

323
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,278
Just a minute. Matthew, you can... ah!

324
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,480
You Wanna fight, huh?

325
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,245
No, wait!

326
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,289
Alida says you're a just man.

327
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:17,785
I believe her.

328
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,686
C'mon, c'mon.

329
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,098
Your committee had no right
to exile these people.

330
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,099
I think the committee
might have missed one.

331
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:28,927
C'mon.

332
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,234
What gives you the right?

333
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,939
- We studied each man's past.
- Whose? Whose?

334
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,613
'Polite Leger's?
Huh?

335
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,012
What you talking about, man?

336
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,574
- 'Polite Leger's?
- Huh?

337
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,383
What you talking about?

338
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:48,322
Fever took his family 2 years ago.
He ran wild for a time.

339
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,759
But he's better now.
I personally guarantee he's better.

340
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:55,756
- What's your guarantee worth to me?
- What is it with you man, huh?

341
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,891
Is it because
I keep my promise?

342
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,307
What promise?

343
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:09,936
Huh?

344
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,011
It's a secret.

345
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,090
You and your friend
can both go to hell.

346
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,253
You go ahead and ask her.

347
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,585
You ask Alida what the secret is.

348
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,588
Why would Alida
keep a secret from me?

349
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,363
Because like many people,
she's afraid of your father.

350
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,930
Yeah, you ask her.

351
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,506
Maybe you'll know
that I mean you no harm.

352
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,043
Just as these people here
do not deserve your exiles.

353
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,960
If what you say is true,
I'll do what I can for your friend.

354
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,757
Leger.

355
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,828
'Polite Leger.

356
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,169
'Polite Leger.

357
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,607
You can have the pecans.

358
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,044
I'll take two.

359
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,388
If I lose these I'll quit
playing cards forever.

360
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,790
'Polite Leger.

361
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:06,617
(music)

362
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,188
(music)

363
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,033
(whip cracks)

364
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,197
(cows moo)

365
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,677
- Look how many men they have.
- Shhh.

366
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:44,125
Hey, Meaux, at least six head
we left in the woods back there.

367
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,801
Come on.
Let's go.

368
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,134
Where they going?

369
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,302
I sent 'em for the strays.

370
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,013
I'd have gotten to it.

371
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,138
Aah.

372
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,683
Let's get 'em.
They're stealing cattle!

373
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,095
I'm coming!

374
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,379
Heeya! Heeya!

375
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:15,621
No!

376
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:17,883
No shooting!

377
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,325
You three, get after him.

378
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,657
Let's all get back to the herd.

379
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:23,889
Matthew.

380
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,229
I said no!
Let's all get back to the herd.

381
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,462
That Leger boy, he don't give up.

382
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,538
Who?

383
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,206
Leger. 'Polite Leger.

384
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:41,606
Come on!

385
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,575
Who 'Polite?

386
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,551
- Yes, it was 'Polite!
- Couldn't have been 'Polite!

387
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,456
Now Matthew thinks you two are trying
to make a fool of him.

388
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,326
Maybe you think you can
make a fool of everybody, huh?

389
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,590
You promised not to tell.

390
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:00,759
- Alida, he couldn't beat it out of me.
- Matthew said you started the fight.

391
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,667
And you told him to ask me
about the baby.

392
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,173
I didn't tell!

393
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,836
An expectant father has
a right to know. But I did not tell.

394
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,711
Why did you come by, Belizaire?
Huh?

395
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,686
I have enough citronelle for a month.

396
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,249
The fais do-do is tonight.

397
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,750
Those days are gone.

398
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:26,227
You should see the neighbors
and relatives you don't see no more.

399
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,695
That's over with.

400
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,393
Why? Is he home tonight?

401
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,036
You need have no fear
for the child you carry.

402
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:40,440
- The baby is not the reason.
- The unborn, they love to dance!

403
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,270
If that child was mine,
we'd be dancing.

404
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,441
And we'd be dancing all the time.

405
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,917
Belizaire...

406
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,218
My goodness.

407
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,092
Go on home.

408
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,692
Well...

409
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,235
It's at Ozeme Guidry's house.

410
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:11,832
Go on.

411
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,487
Come with us, 'Polite.

412
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,253
I don't wanna go.

413
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,425
I'll be alright.

414
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,255
Here, take this gun.
You're gonna need it.

415
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,425
- What about you?
- I got a better one.

416
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,096
(noise inside)

417
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,370
I know I'm not to dig
in your armoire, Belizaire.

418
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,538
But I really needed a drink.

419
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,013
You rustling Perry's cattle?

420
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,016
No! Parrain needed some meat.

421
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,346
Matthew Perry was helping you.

422
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,717
- I didn't know that.
- I did this for you!

423
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,720
We was only after a head or two.

424
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,890
Where is your Parrain?

425
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,794
- They all left for Texas.
- So what are you doing here?

426
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,762
- I don't wanna go to Texas.
- Get on your horse!

427
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,097
- No, Belizaire!
- Right now! Get on your horse.

428
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,936
No, I don't wanna go to Texas.

429
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,508
(horse galloping)

430
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:57,912
Mr. Belizaire!

431
00:33:58,836 --> 00:33:59,644
What?

432
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,882
Fais do-do at Ozeme Guidry's
house tonight.

433
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,418
I know that.

434
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,119
T-Paul, wait!

435
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:18,325
Why don't you, huh... go by
Alida Thibodeaux's house.

436
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,664
Sure thing.

437
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,684
You DEV-

438
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,425
(singing)

439
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,468
- Thank you. You dance real good.
- You're welcome.

440
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,938
I enjoyed it too.

441
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:41,846
Mama, my poor toes...
I think he broke some of my toes.

442
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,521
Take it easy, 'Polite.

443
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,628
You've had lots already,
and you're in trouble, boy.

444
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:02,531
Ah, there's Alida
with the 3 half-Americans.

445
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,605
You come to say bye to those
your husband is sending away?

446
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,180
'Polite, it makes me sad.
I'm sorry.

447
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,787
I'm going to dance.
I don't want no trouble with you.

448
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,189
Ever been to Texas, son?

449
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:40,798
Come dance.

450
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,136
I don't want to.

451
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,944
- Come dance with me again.
- I don't want to.

452
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,011
Come on.

453
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,375
I don't want to!

454
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:52,852
- He insulted my daughter.
- It's my house. I'll take care of it.

455
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,955
- 'Polite...
- Uh, oh.

456
00:36:56,514 --> 00:37:00,394
- You need to leave.
- Leave? You're not a vigilante.

457
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,289
I know, but it's my house.
You know I let anybody come here.

458
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,534
I ain't got but 2 rules.
The drinks stay outside,

459
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,171
and the drunks stay outside.
Now go on with Belizaire.

460
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,608
I'm not gonna go.

461
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,177
- You're not a vigilante.
- Wait!

462
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,212
I ain't leaving.

463
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,220
- He insulted my daughter!
- Wait! Belizaire will take care of it.

464
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,324
I'm not going!

465
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,152
I ain't gonna go.

466
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,861
Let's dance.

467
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,529
(music starts)

468
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,339
I feel sick.
You always have something.

469
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,714
I feel bad.

470
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,246
Then go to my house
and you go to sleep right now.

471
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,855
I'm afraid of the Texas, Belizaire.

472
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,059
You think it's gonna be alright?

473
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,335
I don't know.

474
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,372
But you know everything.

475
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,576
No, I don't know everything.

476
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,508
You always said you did.

477
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,282
Yeah, well...

478
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,918
I guess I meant
almost everything.

479
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,125
C'mon. Go to my house
and go to sleep.

480
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,037
Goodnight, Belizaire.

481
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,822
Don't worry, Belizaire.
His horse will get him home.

482
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,397
Home? It'll get him all the way to Texas.

483
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,360
Pass me that wine, Sosthene.

484
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,234
Pass him this jug.

485
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,276
- You made that?
- Sure did.

486
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,377
There's much more
where that comes from.

487
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,379
You always made
the best wine.

488
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,283
Sure gonna miss that
when you're gone.

489
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,089
What you mean?

490
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,718
You're not gonna get rid of me.
There's no chance.

491
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,988
I'm gonna stay here.
I'm not leaving.

492
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,667
(singing)

493
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,408
Speedy, good boy.

494
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,323
I'm sorry!

495
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,045
Speedy!

496
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,108
(whistle)

497
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,581
(whistle)

498
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:24,826
Speedy!

499
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,188
(horses galloping)

500
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,733
Oh, no!

501
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,469
Get him!

502
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,284
Leave me alone, please.

503
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,052
Get a rope on him.

504
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,057
(shouting)

505
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:07,961
Take his shirt off!

506
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:12,567
Let go.

507
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,807
What's the matter,
did he hurt you?

508
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,546
This man is drunk, he doesn't
even know what's happening.

509
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:24,143
- No whipping needed here.
- You gonna let him go again?

510
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:27,051
No whipping needed I said.
Take him down from the tree.

511
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,990
Matthew shouldn't do it.
Let Meaux do it. Get the whip.

512
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,294
You gonna let him go again?

513
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,159
Huh? Why don't you let him do it?

514
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,565
You can kiss it and make it better.

515
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,230
You know what I wish?
I wish it was you that was tied to that tree.

516
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,138
(scream)

517
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,237
(scream)

518
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,139
(scream)

519
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,286
Matthew Perry, I'm gonna kill you!

520
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,055
Kill you!

521
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:06,923
(scream)

522
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:09,661
(scream)

523
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,332
(scream)

524
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,127
Let the good times roll!

525
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:49,764
Be still!

526
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,038
(scream)

527
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,380
(scream)

528
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,424
We oughta stop 'em.

529
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:17,490
Then we'd all go to Texas together.
Make a wagon train.

530
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,261
I don't want any part of this.

531
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,357
We got our families to think about.

532
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:21,495
We got our families to think about.

533
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:04,912
(chopping)

534
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,372
- It hurts.
- Shhh.

535
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,683
It hurts bad, Belizaire.

536
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:49,957
(groaning)

537
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,893
Matthew!
Come on out here.

538
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,901
Quiet! You're gonna wake the whole house.

539
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,199
- I wanna talk to Matthew.
- He's not home now.

540
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,500
Who is he whipping now?

541
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,074
I'll wait.

542
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,551
You come away with me, Alida.
Away from this place right now.

543
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,291
I can't. I'm a married woman.

544
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,759
Not in the eyes of my God.
You are not a married woman.

545
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:33,163
I am.
Even if there's no paper to say so I am.

546
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:37,596
I've got Matthew and my children.
There's no place left for you, Belizaire.

547
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,334
Matthew has his father and the vigilantes.
There's no room left for you.

548
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:42,838
It's too late!

549
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:44,873
It's too late.

550
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,780
Please, you must leave
before Matthew returns.

551
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,147
My God, I could love you if you
come away with me right now.

552
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:59,086
What about my children?
How you gonna feed my babies?

553
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,923
With pecans?
That you can't even keep.

554
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,125
What do you have
to offer us, Belizaire? What?

555
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,534
Dolsin wants a horse for his birthday.
Where would you ever get him a horse?

556
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,295
Where would we go?
Where would you take us?

557
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,419
(Creak)

558
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,645
- Come see.
- Look.

559
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,112
- Come here.
- Who is it?

560
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,648
Looks like a man's face.

561
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,584
Dolsin, stay!

562
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,056
(wailing)

563
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:11,127
Oh my God!
Matthew! Matthew!

564
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,427
Matthew! Matthew!

565
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,500
They'll expect you to go west.
Instead go south to Cheniere au Tigre.

566
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,844
- No!
- You'll catch a schooner to Galveston.

567
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,350
- But Parrain!
- Your Parrain got you into this!

568
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,151
(sobbing)

569
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,431
No. No. No, Matthew!

570
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:53,570
No. No, Please. Please

571
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:03,612
I'll pray for you.

572
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,480
I'll miss you.

573
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,035
Heeya!

574
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,880
I will praise Thee with my whole heart.

575
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,810
Before the Gods will I sing praise unto Thee.

576
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:41,446
Whither shall I go from Thy spirit
or flee from Thy presence.

577
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,354
If I ascend up into heaven,
Thou art there.

578
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,588
If I make my bed in hell,
behold, Thou art there.

579
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:55,800
If I take the wings of the morning,
and dwell in the utmost parts of the sea,

580
00:49:56,026 --> 00:50:00,304
even there shall Thy hand lead me,
and Thy right hand shall hold me.

581
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:08,916
Naked I came out of my mother's womb,
and naked shall I return.

582
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:14,450
The Lord gave,
the Lord hath taken away.

583
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:18,326
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

584
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:25,489
Therefore are they before the throne
of God and serve Him day and night.

585
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,999
And He who sits on the throne
shall dwell among them.

586
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,067
They shall hunger no more,
neither thirst in Him.

587
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,573
Neither shall the sun
light on them or any heat.

588
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:43,076
For the lamb in the midst of the throne
shall feed them and lead them...

589
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,380
unto living fountains of waters...

590
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:51,090
and God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes.

591
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:59,200
Jesus said, "I am the
resurrection and the life...

592
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:03,036
He that believeth in Me
yet shall he live...

593
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:08,000
...and whomsoever believeth
in Me shall never die."

594
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,911
Believest thou this.

595
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,104
Amen.

596
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,513
(mournful music)

597
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,092
We're gonna ride.

598
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,384
If this keeps on there'll be
no stopping it.

599
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,382
Rebecca, we have to go.

600
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,493
Mister Perry.

601
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,053
I'm sorry.

602
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,297
I beg you to hear me.

603
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,798
How could a man do harm
or take the life of another man

604
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,500
if he could not walk?

605
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:49,103
Stay away from here!

606
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,375
After the whipping these men gave
'Polite Leger, he could not walk.

607
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,606
Show some respect!

608
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,216
Get 'em home.

609
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,948
Go! Go!

610
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,517
I tied his wounds!

611
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:06,659
Another matter.

612
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:12,259
Listen. Matthew's children,
you've got to provide for them now.

613
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,496
They're gonna need milk and rice.

614
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,973
They're just babies.

615
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:20,668
Mister Perry!

616
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:22,769
Mister Perry!

617
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,391
You better get these men
off these horses, they'll be criminals.

618
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:41,993
You men touch a hair on that boy's head,
I'll jail the lot of you.

619
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,325
You're putting yourselves above the law.

620
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,736
- We're gonna go by Cypress Island Road.
- Make sure you get him.

621
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,101
I know that Leger boy.

622
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,504
I'll have to lock up all of you.

623
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,405
You jail 'em now!

624
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,976
- You people ride out...
- Jail 'em now I said, you hear me?

625
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:01,481
You people ride out and hurt that boy,
you'll be criminals...

626
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,407
You, off your horse.

627
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:04,981
Careful, Belizaire.

628
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,875
After all, it was your cousin Leger's
choice to ride out of my town.

629
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,247
You don't need a posse.

630
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,978
Lend me Lightning.
He's the only fast horse in the Parish.

631
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,209
Lightning?

632
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,351
Lightning is Parish property.

633
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,321
Besides, he has a race Saturday.

634
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,584
Do you want them to hang 'Polite?

635
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,792
I'll not start a war.

636
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,132
No. You got it all wrong.

637
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:56,827
I got express permission
from the authorities to do What I'm doing.

638
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,837
Get your hands off!

639
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:12,846
(Punch)

640
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:18,219
Matthew and Alida
were never married.

641
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,290
You must have forgotten about it.

642
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:22,855
How large a bribe
are you asking?

643
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,496
Matthew's children would inherit
half the estate when Old Man Perry dies.

644
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,226
I know the law, Sheriff.

645
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:34,073
And to think people used to tell me
you didn't want to learn our customs.

646
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,734
What exactly do you want from me?

647
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,342
I want to end the vigilantes.

648
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,844
That's not under my control.

649
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:42,075
When they come back from hanging Leger,
I want them to find...

650
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:44,675
That I have caught
Matthew's real murderer.

651
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:49,285
But all of my best witnesses
are being chased out of town.

652
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,626
I need one of their own
to convince them.

653
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,623
I need you,
Mr. Willoughby, as my witness.

654
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,841
Who do you plan to arrest?

655
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,115
You knew Matthew's enemies
better than I did.

656
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:17,911
You choose.

657
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:21,812
(mosquitoes buzz)

658
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,100
Give him the milk.

659
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,274
- Careful.
- Hold on a minute!

660
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,406
What is he doing here?

661
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,576
We're not gonna let them go hungry.

662
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,112
- If you think we're gonna provide...
- No! James

663
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:51,652
- James, please!
- Grab him! Stop him!

664
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,947
- We're not going to let them starve.
- Bring him back here.

665
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,318
They are my brother's children.

666
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,389
- You hold still. Hold still.
- Let me go! Let me go!

667
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,622
Bring him over here.
I'm sorry did I scare you?

668
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:03,163
Come here. I want to talk to you.

669
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:07,165
- Are you alright, Dolsin?
- Come here. It's alright. I'm sorry.

670
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:16,442
Do you know who lam, huh?
I'm your uncle, right?

671
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,777
I didn't know you who you were.

672
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:20,871
Just give us a second here.

673
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:23,974
Your papa's dead.

674
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,445
Do you feel bad about that?

675
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:32,522
Does it make you feel just awful,
your Papa getting killed like that.

676
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,427
You know anybody
who was giving your Papa trouble?

677
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,900
If you know, then whisper it in my ear.

678
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,197
Belizaire Breaux.

679
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,773
Go grab the Sheriff.
Bring him back here.

680
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,817
Should I get the boy more milk?

681
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,152
We can't let the bastards think
they have any claim on this place.

682
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:03,985
Go grab the Sheriff.

683
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:08,760
No... James... stop... James!

684
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,162
What's the matter?

685
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,494
We are gonna care
for Matthew's children.

686
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:14,164
The hell we are.

687
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,830
You're not in charge here, James.

688
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,798
Then who is?

689
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,371
Matthew's dead.

690
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,372
So if I'm not in charge yet,
it won't be long.

691
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:31,609
And when I am, those bastard children
won't touch a head of our cattle.

692
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,348
You are not in Mississippi anymore, James.

693
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:37,592
The law in Louisiana
says I inherit the herd.

694
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:41,094
Not you. Not us. Me.

695
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:45,294
When it is mine,
I can do anything I like.

696
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:49,462
But the same Louisiana law
says I am the lord and master here.

697
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:50,433
Not you.

698
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,003
Not us. And not those bastard children.

699
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:03,511
I don't see what you're worried about.
We convicted men with half this evidence.

700
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:08,986
I don't doubt it. I just wish I had a guarantee
you'll keep your end of the bargain.

701
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,014
You got my word, don't you?

702
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:11,956
Ha.

703
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:13,955
- What?
- Dolsin...

704
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,823
He thinks you killed his Papa.

705
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:22,426
- Alida, I got to explain to him.
- No.

706
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:26,099
- The stories he's gonna be told.
- No. You don't understand.

707
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,703
He told James Willoughby.

708
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:31,677
But Willoughby would never believe
that I'm even capable of...

709
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:33,781
No, Willoughby is going to the Sheriff.

710
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:37,480
You must go no now, Belizaire.
You must leave. Please.

711
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:38,849
What?

712
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,090
Come here. They find you here,
they'll accuse you.

713
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,422
- Get in here. - Be careful.
- Just get in here.

714
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,197
That's him.

715
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,545
I did not kill Matthew Perry.

716
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,641
How'd he know we were coming?

717
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,775
And neither did 'Polite Leger.

718
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,114
I know what you're thinking, Belizaire.

719
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,850
You don't have a chance.
You have to come with us.

720
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,322
Oh...

721
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,526
Get him! Get up there, don't let him go.

722
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,329
(hatch slams)

723
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:36,733
Go around back.

724
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,270
Be careful now.

725
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:43,842
- Hurry.
- Come on, let's go! Get the ladder. C'mon.

726
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,641
Whoa. Whoa!!

727
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,175
That's too bad.

728
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:17,407
Alright in there?

729
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,382
Save yourself, Belizaire!

730
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:22,819
Where did he go?

731
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,464
There he is. Go around back.

732
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,170
Hurry! Go, go, get him!

733
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,404
Oh, the outhouse! I got to use that!

734
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:43,470
Yo!

735
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,149
Come on, get him. Get him.

736
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,353
Nobody shoot! We need him alive.

737
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,659
Call the vigilantes off 'Polite!

738
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,966
Too late for that, Belizaire.

739
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,169
What is it you want of me?

740
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,833
To say I killed Matthew Perry?

741
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:14,942
Would that end this violence?

742
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,406
Alright then, I killed Matthew Perry.
You hear me?

743
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,381
I killed Matthew Perry.

744
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,852
You call the vigilantes off 'Polite.

745
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,849
Your confession is written, Belizaire.

746
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:59,277
- I'll read it to you.
- I'll read it myself.

747
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,889
Didn't know you could read.

748
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:05,814
Theodule, see if the horses are ready.

749
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:06,418
Theodule, see if the horses are ready.

750
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,312
Fathered...

751
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,382
Yes, that's right.

752
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:40,054
This says I fathered his children.

753
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:44,256
You read very well, but this is
a legal document that means...

754
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,799
No, Belizaire, it says you were
like a father to them.

755
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:48,699
No, it says that
I fathered his children.

756
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:52,000
This sentence means
that you are responsible. Otherwise...

757
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:52,360
There's no word about responsibility.

758
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,204
There's no word about responsibility.

759
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,776
You don't understand
what you're reading!

760
01:03:55,898 --> 01:04:00,347
No. What this means is that if I fathered his
children, they can't inherit his Wealth.

761
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,210
No, no. It doesn't mean that at all.

762
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,580
That's the only confession I'll agree to.

763
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,321
That you'll agree to?
Whose confession is it, his or mine?

764
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:07,876
What about Leger?

765
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:08,981
What about Leger?

766
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,458
Sign and I'll send someone on Lightning to
save him.

767
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,867
(horse whinnies)

768
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,104
You promised Lightning.

769
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:29,674
That's a plug!

770
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,211
Get it!

771
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,314
You got it?

772
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:48,521
So what if you and your cousin hang?
I'll save nineteen families from exile!

773
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,081
We're going to get Leger.

774
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,638
What do you want, Belizaire?

775
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:09,980
What do you want, Belizaire?

776
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,249
I've been doing
a lot of thinking, and uh...

777
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,018
if I confess that I fathered
those children.

778
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,021
I should leave something
to provide for them.

779
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:28,532
Well...

780
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:32,833
Alright...
What exactly is it you want?

781
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,769
Just a cow.

782
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:40,669
A cow?

783
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,307
A cow?

784
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,047
A milk cow...
a good producer.

785
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,987
Alida will need milk
for the children.

786
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:53,125
Alright.
I can let you have a cow.

787
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,361
A mule...

788
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,957
You're not gonna
leave her your mule?

789
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:04,764
My mule is enough to keep me in corn,
but with a family to support like that...

790
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,275
Give him a new mule.

791
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:14,142
Alright.

792
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,741
That's one cow and one mule.

793
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,319
Boy, I sure would love
to give her a horse.

794
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:26,654
No horse!

795
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,161
She got 2 mules.
She doesn't need a horse.

796
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:33,290
I know. I'm just saying,
I would love to give her a horse.

797
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,630
I'm not giving her a horse.

798
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:41,402
You're supposed to take care of her,
not me. I'm doing you a favor. No horse.

799
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,731
You're gonna give her the horse.

800
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:43,107
You're gonna give her the horse.

801
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:44,243
You give her the horse

802
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:50,282
or in my last words from the gallows, I'll just
tell how you and me killed Perry together.

803
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,453
Nobody'd believe you.

804
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,146
Oh, they'd believe me.

805
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,923
A man that's gonna hang
can afford to tell the truth.

806
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:08,298
I'm not gonna deprive a man of his
last words for the price of a horse.

807
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:10,965
The horse is not the issue here.

808
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,762
I will not be made a fool of.
Not by him.

809
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:14,366
I will not be made a fool of.
Not by him.

810
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,545
I'm hanging the man.
What more do you want?

811
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:24,142
And not some little Creole pony, either.
I want a big, strong...

812
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,844
an American horse.

813
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:29,277
Oh, no.

814
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:29,688
Oh, no.

815
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:35,589
You let that man speak from the gallows,
you lose me as a witness.

816
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,828
I must get rid of the vigilantes,
Belizaire.

817
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:40,465
I'm sorry... but I need him.

818
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:43,536
Well, if I can't speak from the gallows,
I got other ways.

819
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:50,404
What kind of spell you gonna cast...
in a ball and chain?

820
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:54,408
Get what you wanted, Belizaire?

821
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,007
He's a very rich man.

822
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,086
You could've gotten two
or three pigs real easy.

823
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,060
And on that curse,
make it a good one.

824
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:29,472
Get back, hurry up!

825
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:34,813
Hey, that's his horse.

826
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:38,548
- Now we got him. He's on foot.
- This way, come on!

827
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:52,263
Can't be far, we was
right behind him.

828
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:55,372
Leave the horses here, let's go.

829
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,445
Alright guys, let's go, huh?

830
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:48,917
Stop him. Stop him!
Come back with that horse.

831
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,829
Stop him. Stop him!
Come back with that horse.

832
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:20,348
Leger!

833
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:20,952
Leger!

834
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,258
Watch out for hidden logs
now, huh?

835
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:33,503
Come on. Try that other side.

836
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:41,479
Give yourself up!

837
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,414
Give it up, 'Polite.

838
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:53,551
I left!

839
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,393
You told me to leave and I did.

840
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:00,557
You killed Matthew Perry
and you're gonna hang for it.

841
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,896
I didn't kill him.

842
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,738
You said you'd kill him.
When he whipped you.

843
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,701
He hurt me,
but I didn't kill nobody.

844
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,364
I stole a cow,
I didn't kill nobody.

845
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:37,925
Give yourself up, Leger!

846
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:38,563
Give yourself up, Leger!

847
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,360
I'll go to Texas.

848
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,523
I'll go further than Texas.

849
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:08,956
I'll go to Mexico.

850
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:09,833
I'll go to Mexico.

851
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,500
Take him alive!

852
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,269
Give yourself up!

853
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:24,472
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

854
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:25,144
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

855
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:26,685
Take him alive!

856
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:34,517
Please don't.

857
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:37,520
Please, huh...

858
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:39,987
Please, I'll go.

859
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:40,159
Please, I'll go.

860
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:44,237
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

861
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,853
This is not a firing squad,
it's a damn turkey shoot.

862
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:37,249
It's Belizaire! And he's on Lightning!
Get him, Theodule.

863
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:57,565
You got no right here, Sheriff.

864
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:58,943
You got no right here, Sheriff.

865
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,473
You got no right.

866
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,307
You men throw those guns down.

867
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,478
Throw down those guns, I say!

868
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:06,545
Throw them down now.

869
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,516
It's not your affair, Sheriff.

870
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:11,953
What you been doing here?

871
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:17,929
Theodule, get those guns.

872
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:46,917
Theodule, pick up the guns.

873
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:48,852
Take that gun away
from that man.

874
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,332
Damn you, Willoughby.

875
01:14:58,427 --> 01:14:59,627
(praying)

876
01:14:59,628 --> 01:14:59,901
(praying)

877
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,278
You men are murderers.

878
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,142
An execution is not a murder.

879
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:15,553
An execution is not a murder.

880
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:19,589
Killing an innocent man is murder,
and one of you'll have to hang for it.

881
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:26,922
Belizaire!

882
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,332
Which one of them you wanna
see hang with you?

883
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:26,858
Those.

884
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:35,968
(praying)

885
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:12,066
You got that pointed belly.

886
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:17,675
The boy grows well.

887
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,278
His name will be Belizaire.

888
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:27,143
Belizaire...

889
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,016
He'll be trouble.

890
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:32,448
(laughing)

891
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:39,625
I wish you could be
there to treat him.

892
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:54,471
Why a confession, Belizaire?
I could have proven you were innocent.

893
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,244
To save 'Polite.

894
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:57,681
But you didn't.

895
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,310
You didn't save 'Polite.

896
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:03,179
No, I didn't, did I?

897
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,021
And little 'Polite,

898
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,159
all alone out there.

899
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,562
Stopping the men that took the law
unto themselves.

900
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:20,172
Well, all a man's life is Worth
are his deeds.

901
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:24,266
And yet they come from 30 miles around to see
me hang for my prayers.

902
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:27,674
But I have no deeds.

903
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,608
I have no deeds.

904
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,626
The people will miss their healer.

905
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,206
(crowd talking)

906
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:04,416
Whoa.

907
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:22,767
Father...

908
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:26,364
Ohhh, Father.

909
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:33,903
It's funny, I just sent someone for the last
batch of the balm you need for your shoulder.

910
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,083
It should keep you
for quite some time.

911
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:39,174
Let me see that.

912
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:40,982
Thank you, Belizaire.

913
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:45,682
I've also given some thought
to your other problem.

914
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:49,086
My problem?
I'm here about your problem, Belizaire.

915
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,095
No, I mean the one
with the Bishop.

916
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:52,831
Yeah, huh...

917
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:57,468
A triple hanging will be terrible news
even in a place like New Orleans.

918
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,301
I'm sure he'll have heard
about that.

919
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:04,001
- The Diocese already wrote me about it.
- I knew!

920
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:09,949
Father, wouldn't the Bishop
be proud...

921
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:15,081
if that young American landowner who
was murdered, that... that Matthew Perry...

922
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,591
Let's just say that he was
the very Protestant...

923
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:21,119
that you had converted
to the Church.

924
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:23,118
A convert?

925
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,198
Married in the Church.

926
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:28,992
And you baptized his children.

927
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,838
Boo! Boo!

928
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,163
(cheers)

929
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:56,287
(applause)

930
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:08,197
Well, you want to talk to the Bishop?

931
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,095
No.

932
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:21,509
Please, please.

933
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:25,312
Of all this man's sins,

934
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:29,553
God knows I know most of them,

935
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:34,385
The greatest was to defame
the children of Matthew Perry.

936
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,424
No! No! Belizaire, no!

937
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,290
- Please, one moment, please...
- Trust me.

938
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:46,296
- Matthew Perry and Alida Thibodeaux...
- Well, then trust the Father.

939
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:48,238
Both of the Parish of Vermilion...

940
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,943
I trust him less, Belizaire.

941
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:53,979
Matthew and Alida
were married by me...

942
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:57,016
- ...when I first arrived years ago.
- That is a lie!

943
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:00,318
Don't believe that priest.
Get him off of there.

944
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,877
- Due to the circumstances...
- Hey...

945
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:04,890
...the Widow Perry is gonna need
help with her new estate.

946
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:08,856
How much did you pay him?
Get him off of there!

947
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:15,993
You know, Belizaire, I've always wanted
to get in the cattle business, on the side.

948
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:19,637
- The children are all his, all legitimate...
- How does he know this?

949
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:23,232
They're all legitimate,
all baptized in Holy Mother the Church.

950
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:24,276
This is a lie!

951
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,410
(applause and cheers)

952
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:30,012
You're betraying your Church
and you're betraying me.

953
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:33,284
Please, please...
I want to apologize to the family...

954
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:36,582
- Get him off of there!
- for not conducting the funeral services.

955
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:40,786
He lies to you from the pulpit,
he'll lie to you from the gallows.

956
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:42,553
How much did they pay you?

957
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:46,592
I hope this clears the whole matter up.

958
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:48,132
Liar!

959
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,464
- This town don't need you!
- Get outta here!

960
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,578
It brings me great sadness
to be leaving this earth now.

961
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:36,944
No! No!

962
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:44,748
You know, I haven't even apprenticed
my secrets of healing. But, uh.

963
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:51,062
Before I go, I wanted to pass out
to you a little inventory...

964
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:54,560
of some of my medicaments
and remedies.

965
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:58,461
There's nothing here
that's good without prayers.

966
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:03,032
But those of you if you could use it...

967
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,139
it's yours.

968
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,978
That's an elixir
for the breakbone fever.

969
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:18,220
Anybody could use that?

970
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:20,390
anybody?

971
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,787
Belizaire, me!
Belizaire, me!

972
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:29,557
Good.

973
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:34,105
Pass that down to the man
in the straw hat, Theodule.

974
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,939
(applause)

975
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:42,139
Thank you, Belizaire.

976
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:48,151
There's a poultice for the snakebite.

977
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,888
That's good for
your afflictions of the gums.

978
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:56,887
Ozeme!

979
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,165
Yeah, for me?

980
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:04,195
Here you go.

981
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:08,964
You remember me to your daddy.

982
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:17,976
Maybe you have him cook up a nice
gumbo for everybody after I'm gone.

983
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,082
Two. Two gumbos.

984
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:21,949
Never say die.

985
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,614
Yeah, never say die.

986
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:26,558
Never say die!

987
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,971
That's the most potent and
popular elixir in the Parish.

988
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:47,371
One drop in a glass of water
to cure a cold, two for pneumonia.

989
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,182
Who wants it? Who gets it?

990
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,114
Sosthene.

991
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:57,984
Thank you.

992
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:07,760
Hey, that's a charm for the lonely.

993
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:12,601
If you put that under the pillow
of the one you love,

994
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:15,396
that'll bring a proposal
of marriage.

995
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:16,908
Ooohh...

996
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,076
It will.

997
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:22,809
Hey, where's Widow Comeaux?

998
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:24,476
(laughs)

999
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:26,511
Widow Comeaux.

1000
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:29,080
Widow Comeaux!

1001
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,165
That's for you.

1002
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:51,536
Dolsin, will you come sit
in the buggy?

1003
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:57,641
Yes, ma'am.

1004
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:27,173
This was given to me by an old
Santo Dominguan slave woman.

1005
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:32,809
- She called it the gris-gris of judgement.
- Ooohh...

1006
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:35,778
But I warn you about that.

1007
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:38,816
'Cause I've seen the effect
of that root.

1008
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:43,992
Must not be touched,
nor played with...

1009
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:46,158
by a little child.

1010
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:47,730
Oh, no.

1011
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:56,967
I've seen liars touch that and they was
stricken with the asthmatic fevers.

1012
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:00,639
I've seen thieves touch it...

1013
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:04,846
- They spit up their own blood.
- Ooohh.

1014
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:08,115
You know, I've been told...

1015
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,224
Belizaire!

1016
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,527
Belizaire?

1017
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:20,893
I've been told that a man who's had the
misfortune of taking another man's life...

1018
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:25,999
should he be in the presence
of this root...

1019
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:30,599
- ...he would be struck dead.
- Ooohh.

1020
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:38,312
I guess that goes for me, too.
Ha, ha, ha!

1021
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:49,927
You want to touch that, eh?

1022
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:55,198
You wanna touch that?
How about you, Meaux?

1023
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:57,901
How about you?

1024
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:01,402
Oohohoh...

1025
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:08,003
Oh no, the executioner, he don't
wanna touch that, does he?

1026
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,360
Well...

1027
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:30,933
Hey!

1028
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:35,532
Whosoever wants that...

1029
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,937
let him take it...

1030
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,548
Mr. Willoughby!

1031
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:51,654
I'm talking to you!

1032
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:56,421
Here!

1033
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:01,462
Why don't you touch that?

1034
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:04,963
- I wouldn't dirty my hands.
- Touch it! - Touch it!

1035
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,406
- You believe in it, you touch it.
- You touch it!

1036
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,772
Don't you touch me, boy.
I'll tell you.

1037
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:11,903
Here you touch that!

1038
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,904
You can't fool me with black magic.
Nothing to do with me!

1039
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:21,677
Now you touch that, unless you,
and not I, took the life of Matthew Perry!

1040
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:30,157
Touch it. Touch it. Touch it...

1041
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:40,228
Touch it.

1042
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:41,639
Touch it.

1043
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:44,273
Touch it. Touch it, Touch it...

1044
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,246
Touch it! Touch it! Touch it...

1045
01:31:52,306 --> 01:31:54,308
Touch it! Touch it!

1046
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:55,750
Touch it!

1047
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:02,593
Touch it! Touch it!

1048
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,156
Touch it!

1049
01:32:07,989 --> 01:32:10,595
Touch it. Touch it. Touch it...

1050
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,564
Touch it!

1051
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:16,372
Touch it! Touch it!

1052
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,007
Get off!

1053
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:24,981
Get him!

1054
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,886
(angry shouts)

1055
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,206
(choking)

1056
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:54,604
Belizaire!

1057
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,445
Belizaire! Hold on!

1058
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,718
Belizaire, hold on!

1059
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:00,881
Hold on!

1060
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:14,233
Breathe! Breathe, ooh, breathe.
Breathe, breathe...

1061
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,512
Now you're a man of means,
Belizaire.

1062
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:43,085
Dolsin, remember
what I told you to say.

1063
01:33:43,651 --> 01:33:45,289
Go on, it's alright.

1064
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:56,739
Mr. Belizaire...

1065
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:02,440
I'm sorry for all the trouble
I've gotten you into.

1066
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:07,485
Oh, well.

1067
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:09,515
No trouble.

1068
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:17,724
Listen, uh...

1069
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:24,135
I realize you were born in the fall
of the year, regardless of all that...

1070
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:26,300
Happy birthday.

1071
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:28,664
- For me?
- Yeah, that's for you.

1072
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:31,976
Go on, get up there!

1073
01:34:54,622 --> 01:34:57,660
I guess a year and a day
you'll be in mourning for Matthew.

1074
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,201
I've been thinking about that.

1075
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:17,251
I mean, you'll need someone to provide for you,
now that I'm a man of means, as they say.

1076
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:21,651
And, uh...

1077
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,725
maybe you'll be fixing to marry me.

1078
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:27,829
Ah!

1079
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:32,602
Well, there's no harm in asking,
is there?

1080
01:35:34,028 --> 01:35:36,565
But, Belizaire,
you're not asking me.

1081
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:41,075
Will you marry me?

1082
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:45,648
We'll see, Belizaire.

1083
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:48,545
We'll see.

1084
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:57,287
Well...

1085
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:02,597
Whew.

1086
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:10,408
Come along, my children.

1087
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:13,501
Come on.
