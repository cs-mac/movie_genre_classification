1
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:13,724
Listen, here's the thing.

2
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:18,645
If you can't spot the sucker
in your first half hour at the table,

3
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:20,981
then you are the sucker.

4
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,909
Guys around here'll tell ya...
you play for a living.

5
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:35,996
It's like any other job.
You don't gamble. You grind it out.

6
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,334
Your goal is to win
one big bet an hour, that's it.

7
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,670
Get your money in when you have the best
of it, and protect it when you don't.

8
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:45,756
Don't give anything away.

9
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,675
That's how I've paid my way
through half of law school.

10
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:52,179
A true grinder.

11
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:57,226
See, I learned how to win a little at
a time. But finally, I've learned this...

12
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:01,772
If you're too careful, your
whole life can become a fuckin' grind.

13
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:13,826
This is Teddy KGB's place.

14
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,496
- Five hundred.
- You won't find it in the Yellow Pages.

15
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,706
Nope.
Not tonight.

16
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,750
No? What?

17
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:27,923
Give me three stacks
of high society.

18
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:46,191
Thirty thousand.
Count it.

19
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:57,244
- That's good.
- So, you're sitting the apple.

20
00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:00,414
- Good. Want a cookie?
- No.

21
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,667
He doesn't look like much,

22
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:07,421
but KGB is connected all the way
to the top of the Russian mob.

23
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:10,507
He's the one guy in the game
you don't want to fuck with.

24
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,843
But if you're looking
for high stakes,

25
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,887
this is the only place
in town.

26
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,599
They all know me as a small-timer,
but that's about to change.

27
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:28,358
Joey Knish
is a New York legend.

28
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,236
He's been a rounder,
earning his living at cards...

29
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,906
since he was 19 years old.

30
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,408
What are you,
holdin' those for somebody?

31
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:39,828
Uh, yeah,
I'm holding 'em for you.

32
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:41,872
- You should be.

33
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,750
'Cause I hope you're not thinking
of putting all that glimmer in play.

34
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,128
He's as close to a friend
as there is in this place.

35
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,090
- Come here.
- But tonight,
I don't want to see him.

36
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,425
Now, you don't wanna
butt onions with these guys.

37
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,637
'Cause they'll chew you up,
take your whole bankroll.

38
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,474
- So you say.
- There's plenty of easy games.

39
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:03,811
We get outta here, get some coffee,
ride over to that soft seat in Queens.

40
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,271
I know what I'm doing.

41
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:11,318
You're making a run at it,
aren't you?

42
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:13,987
Rolling up a stake
and going to Vegas.

43
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:17,533
I'm right, right?

44
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:19,785
- I can beat the game.
- Maybe.

45
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:22,329
Maybe this is a game
can be beat.

46
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:25,207
But you know you can beat the 10-20
at the Chesterfield and the Hi-Low...

47
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,668
at that goulash joint
on 79th Street.

48
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:33,006
Okay.
I understand.

49
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:38,929
I understand.
Back to battle.

50
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:44,685
The game in question is
No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em.

51
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:47,479
Minimum buy-in $25,000.

52
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:50,899
A game like this doesn't come together
often outside the casinos.

53
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:53,110
The stakes attract
rich flounders,

54
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,612
and they in turn
attract the sharks.

55
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:03,954
No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em
is the Cadillac of poker.

56
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,458
Each player is dealt
two cards face down.

57
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,711
Five cards are then dealt
face up across the middle.

58
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:14,214
These are community cards everyone can
use to make the best five card hand.

59
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,677
The key to the game is playing
the man, not the cards.

60
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:21,180
Bet an eight ball.

61
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:27,478
There's no other game in which fortunes
can change so much from hand to hand.

62
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,731
A brilliant player can get
a strong hand cracked, go on tilt...

63
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:33,776
and lose his mind along with
every single chip in front of him.

64
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:37,988
This is why the World Series of Poker is
decided over a No-Limit Hold 'Em table.

65
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,741
Some people, pros even,
won't play No-Limit.

66
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:43,077
They can't handle
the swings.

67
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:46,872
But there are others,
like Doyle Brunson,

68
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:50,000
who consider No-Limit
the only pure game left.

69
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:57,674
Like Papa Wallenda said..."Life is on
the wire. The rest is just waiting."

70
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,219
Pass it to you.

71
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:05,641
All right, I raise.

72
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:08,560
- I'm gonna raise five hundred.
- Fold.

73
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,066
It's a position raise.
I call it.

74
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,365
Here's the beauty of this game.

75
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:26,370
- Go ahead.
- I just got
top two pair on the flop,

76
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,414
and I want to keep him
in the hand.

77
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:31,875
Against your average guy,
I'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.

78
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,920
Let him walk into it.
But KGB's too smart for that.

79
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,840
So, what I've got to do
is over-bet the pot,

80
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:40,008
make it look like
I'm trying to buy it.

81
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:44,388
- I bet $2,000.
- Then he plays back at me,
and I get paid off.

82
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,255
Call.

83
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,592
My guess is Teddy's on a flush draw.

84
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,262
Burn and turn.

85
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,016
There's my money card, nine of hearts.

86
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,101
I got a full house.

87
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,522
- To the bettor.
- Check's good.

88
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:39,359
Now I hope
a spade falls and Teddy makes his flush.

89
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:43,447
That way he'll bet strong, and I'll beat
him with my nines full over aces.

90
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:52,372
I'm going to bet...

91
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:55,876
Bet...

92
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,962
$15,000.

93
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,550
Time.

94
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,306
I want him to think
that I'm pondering a call,

95
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,227
but all I'm really thinking about
is Vegas and the fucking Mirage.

96
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:32,246
All right, your 15, plus
I have another 33 to raise you.

97
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:34,289
Um...

98
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,089
Yeah, I'm gonna go all in, 'cause
I don't think you got the spades.

99
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:49,763
You are right.
I don't have spades.

100
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:58,063
I know before
the cards are even turned over.

101
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,279
Aces full, Mike.

102
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:36,602
Get up.

103
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:41,523
Come on.
Come on.

104
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:49,490
- Want some?
- No.

105
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:52,701
I'm down to the felt, Knish.
I lost everything.

106
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:56,955
Man, I lost my case money.
I lost my tuition.

107
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,127
It happens to everyone.
Time to time, everyone goes bust.

108
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:05,255
You'll be back in the game
before you know it.

109
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,383
I'm done.
I'm out of it.

110
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,969
They all say that
at first.

111
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:14,181
Hey, man, let me stake you.
Standard deal, you know.

112
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:18,519
Fifty percent of your winnings.
If you lose, it's on me.

113
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:22,523
I'd just throw it away.

114
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:29,029
- You still got the truck?
- Sure.

115
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:31,073
Come on.

116
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:49,508
You don't hear much
about guys who take their shot and miss,

117
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:51,844
but I'll tell you
what happens to 'em.

118
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:54,763
They end up humping crappy jobs
on graveyard shifts,

119
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,850
trying to figure out
how they came up short.

120
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:01,603
See, I had this picture
in my head.

121
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:04,690
Me sitting at the big table,
Doyle to my left,

122
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:09,236
Amarillo Slim to my right,
playing in the World Series of Poker.

123
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:13,657
And I let that vision
blind me at the table against KGB.

124
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,577
Now, the closest I get
to Vegas is west New York,

125
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:19,204
driving this lousy route
handed down from Knish...

126
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:22,583
to rounders who forget
the cardinal fuckin' rule...

127
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,626
Always leave yourself outs.

128
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:27,171
- Hey, Moogie.
- Let me ask you a question.

129
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,716
In a legal sense, can fuckin'
Steinbrenner just move the Yankees?

130
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,427
Does he have the fuckin' right
to just move them?

131
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,263
I don't know.
How should I know that?

132
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:40,267
- You didn't learn that yet?
- No, we get to Steinbrenner
in the third year of law school.

133
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,103
Oh.

134
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:47,399
- Take care, man.
- Yeah.

135
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:01,246
The judges' game.

136
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,459
I'd heard about it for years on the
street, before I was even in law school.

137
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:09,129
A rotating group of ten or twelve
judges, prosecutors and professors.

138
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:11,632
They all have money,
and in my playing days...

139
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:15,177
it would have been pretty sweet to have
any one of them owing me favors.

140
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,805
Only problem is, no one
can get in the game anymore.

141
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:21,934
One rounder, Crispy Linetta,
sat under some pretense,

142
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:26,480
but they found out he was a pro,
he couldn't cross the street
without a legal hassle.

143
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:29,441
Even his regular club,
Vorshay's, got shut down.

144
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:32,444
Place had been open
since 1907.

145
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:34,405
Oh, Michael.

146
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,157
- You got some things for me?
- Yes, I do.

147
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,535
Put 'em on the desk,
it's all right.

148
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:42,913
Kid, he paying you
for this late night shit?

149
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:46,333
Oh, well, knowledge is
my reward, sir.

150
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,794
- Let me tell you, it ain't worth it.

151
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:51,171
Why don't you become a jockey,
do something useful.

152
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:54,007
- Kid's a little tall, isn't he, Gene?

153
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:57,052
Enough with the Belmont
recruiting spiel. Your bet.

154
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:59,346
- All right. I call.
- Michael is lead counsel...

155
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,765
in the Moot Court
you're presiding over next week, Gene.

156
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,976
Besides, he could use
the background if he's gonna...

157
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:07,104
clerk for one of you fellas
this summer, right?

158
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:11,275
Abe, I thought you liked the kid. Why do
you want to make him a civil servant?

159
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,737
Yeah, look... a word to the wise.
Stay in the private sector.

160
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,782
That Nassau defense attorney's game?
They use our chips for coasters.

161
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:21,201
The amazing thing is, in this
collection of great legal minds,

162
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:24,037
there isn't a single
real card player.

163
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:27,666
- I call.
- Raise.

164
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,877
Um, the professor raises.

165
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:35,174
Mike?
Michael, I would have just called.

166
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:37,176
No, you're good.

167
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,053
All right, I call.

168
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:42,681
I don't know if I'm going to bring
my legal career to a crashing halt...

169
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:46,935
before it even starts,
but I just can't help myself.

170
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,979
- Good.
- I'm in.

171
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,398
- Read 'em and weep.

172
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:57,571
Threes check.

173
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:05,245
Check to Martin and Lewis
over there.

174
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,332
- Check to the raiser.
- Czechoslovakia.

175
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:12,669
- What's the limit?
- $20. Big bet's $20.

176
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:16,840
Okay. Good.
There's $20.

177
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:21,095
You've seen half a hand. How the
fuck are you betting into us?

178
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:23,764
You sure this is wise, Abe?
It's your money the kid's bettin' with.

179
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:28,227
It's plenty wise.
We know what we're holding,
and we know what you're holding.

180
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,021
The fuck you know what we all got.

181
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:34,024
Summer clerkship in your office says
I know what you're holding.

182
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,568
I don't bet
with jobs like that.

183
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:40,030
Let's just say I'll put you at the top
of the list if you're right.

184
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:44,034
Okay. Well, you
were looking for that third three,

185
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,954
but you forgot that Professor Green
folded it on Fourth Street,

186
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:49,206
and now you're representing
that you have it.

187
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,708
The D.A. made his two pair,
but he knows they're no good.

188
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:55,421
Judge Kaplan was trying to squeeze out
a diamond flush, but he came up short,

189
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,881
and Mr. Eisen is futilely hoping
that his queens are gonna stand up.

190
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:01,301
So, like I said,
the Dean's bet is $20.

191
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:04,304
- Well, kiss my ass.
- Kiss my ass.

192
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,103
- What'd you have, Abe?
- Nothin' but a busted straight.

193
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:13,772
- Oh, come on.
- It's good enough to win. Take it down.

194
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:17,317
All right, kid, your first assignment.
Pull up a seat next to me.

195
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:19,987
Oh, I'd like to. I can't, I can't.
I don't play cards.

196
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,657
- Get outta here!
- See you tomorrow.

197
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:26,076
- Whose deal?
- My deal.

198
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,912
- I like the kid, Abe.
- Good kid.

199
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,290
Smart kid.

200
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:34,793
I tell ya, it's hard leaving that game.

201
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:38,422
An open invitation
to lay with those lambs.

202
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,424
But I'm retired.

203
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:45,637
The truth is, I can always
find games, though.

204
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:49,600
Easy games, tough games, straight games,
crooked games, home games.

205
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:53,854
I can turn this truck onto the Jersey
Turnpike and be at the Taj in two hours.

206
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:57,191
But I've made promises.

207
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:02,821
I'm just a law student now.

208
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:06,492
Hello?

209
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:08,494
- Hey.
- Hey.

210
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,873
- How'd it go?
- Oh, great.

211
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:21,423
I am sick of that fucking route.

212
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:24,426
Don't worry.
A few more semesters...

213
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,554
Mmm.

214
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,057
Oh, I gotta go.

215
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,393
- I'm really late.
- Oh, just stay here.
I'll be really quick.

216
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:36,105
- You won't feel a thing.

217
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:38,524
We both know
that's not true.

218
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:41,276
Besides, you should
get some sleep.

219
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,529
These fuckin' long nights
are killing me.

220
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,572
They never used to.

221
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:47,658
Yeah, well, that's different.
I mean, that was like...

222
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:50,411
buy in at 8:00, next thing
you know it's morning.

223
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:53,580
But hey, you know, I think
I'm hooked up for this summer.

224
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,707
Hooked up how?

225
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,586
Well, after I left you last night at the
library, I impressed Judge Marinacci.

226
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:01,755
I think I might be in line
for a clerkship.

227
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,968
Tell me more.

228
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:09,096
Well, those guys were
all playing cards, and...

229
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,807
Just hear me out now,
hear me out.

230
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,810
They were playing cards
and I read his hand blind.

231
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:21,191
So, instead of coming home, you went
and played cards with some judge?

232
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:24,278
No, I wasn't even playing.
They were playing.

233
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:28,907
I just caught his eye
by reading his hand, that's all.

234
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:32,786
I mean, as long as I don't fuck
up Moot Court, I think the job's mine.

235
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:37,833
What kind of job
is that gonna be, Mike?

236
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,419
Writing an opinion
on high-stakes poker?

237
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:43,088
Honey, you're the one
who told me...

238
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:45,758
that I should use my poker skills
in the courtroom.

239
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:48,218
Yeah, I know
I said that, but...

240
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:51,472
You know what I meant.
I meant that you should use your head.

241
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:55,726
You know, the way you calculate odds
on the spot, the way you read people.

242
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:59,772
That's what I meant.
I didn't mean that you should try to
con your way into a summer job.

243
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:04,151
- Honey, con? I was networking.
Oh, God.

244
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:07,738
Networking. Are you trying
to con me now?

245
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:10,574
No.

246
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,202
I just...
I don't think you get it.

247
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:16,830
You'll be just like one
of those ex-college athletes.

248
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:19,500
You know, great job at the
D.A. 's office as long as...

249
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,419
they never miss
a lawyer's league game.

250
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:25,923
It's true. I just think if you
get in this way,

251
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:28,175
you'll always be
a hustler to them.

252
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:30,219
Baby, I didn't even play.

253
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:35,099
Okay.

254
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,142
I'll see you later.

255
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:46,318
Oh.

256
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:50,823
- Hey, hon, can I take
the Jeep tomorrow?
- Yeah, where?

257
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:53,700
Uh, Worm's gettin' out.
I was gonna pick him up.

258
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:56,328
Tomorrow.
Beautiful.

259
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:58,330
I promised
I'd be there, hon.

260
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:02,167
Worm. I just can't believe you
still know someone called "Worm."

261
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:04,211
He's like my brother.

262
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:08,424
Shit.
I didn't even play.

263
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:14,513
I met Worm
at Dwight Inglewood Preparatory
Academy over in Jersey.

264
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:17,516
We were the only two kids attending
who didn't have a trust fund.

265
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,727
My father's office was there.
It said "Custodian" on the door.

266
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:23,355
That's why
they took me.

267
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:29,653
- Pow!

268
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,367
W-Was that, like,
your strong finish or something?

269
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:38,245
- Motherfucker!
- You leave me no choice,
the way you play.

270
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:41,081
That's the fourth time you done
played that bitch of spades on my ass.

271
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:43,584
No, no, no, no, no.

272
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,712
Dowling had it three hands ago, and
two hands ago I got the black Maria,

273
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:48,714
so I don't want to
hear you bitchin', okay?

274
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:51,550
- Yeah, but he shot the moon
on that hand, didn't he?
- Yeah, I saw that.

275
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:55,763
- So it helped you.
- Now... Okay, you're right.

276
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:58,390
You ain't walking outta here
with our grits, Worm.

277
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:01,935
You know the drill, okay? I'm not
gonna smoke 'em. I'll hold on to 'em.

278
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:05,773
if you want 'em back, you can
trade me for 'em, or try to play
double or nothing tomorrow.

279
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:09,777
Murphy! What the hell you sittin'
there for? You're processed. Come on.

280
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,449
Processed? This motherfucker's
gettin' the jump.

281
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,826
Come on, man, have
some decency here, Worm.

282
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,828
You can buy all the smokes
you want in half an hour.

283
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:23,582
- What are you talking about?
I won these fair and square.
- You don't even smoke, Worm.

284
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:27,461
Jesus, you guys are such
fuckin' babies. You know that?

285
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:31,465
If you're determined to die
of cancer, you really oughta
learn how to play cards.

286
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,717
Ain't a good idea to add
insult to injury, yo.

287
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:36,386
- That shit will come back and hurt you.
- You know what?

288
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,389
Not in this lifetime.
Enjoy your time.

289
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:43,977
Murphy.

290
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:46,980
Worm's dad
did the grounds, when he wasn't
too fuckin' drunk.

291
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:49,108
That's when we did 'em.

292
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:51,360
Of course, the grounds
weren't all we did.

293
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:55,447
Worm put us into a scam a day
on all the young aristocrats
we went to school with...

294
00:20:55,531 --> 00:21:00,244
selling 'em dime bags
of oregano, nunchakus
and firecrackers from Chinatown.

295
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,955
- Where's the rest?
- Kept us in lunch money.

296
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:09,795
- Thank you.
- Until the time we went for...

297
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:12,673
more than just pocket change
and got caught.

298
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:16,176
We had the starting five take a dive
against Friends Academy.

299
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,013
The point guard snapped
and gave Worm up.

300
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:27,855
They hauled him up before
the school board, offered him a deal.

301
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:30,983
Tell us who else was involved,
and we'll go easy on you.

302
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:34,486
Worm didn't say a fuckin' word.
Got himself expelled.

303
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,783
- I stayed in school and graduated.
- Crank the outside.

304
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:47,040
Not many guys would stand up
for a friend like that.

305
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,344
- Ta-da!

306
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:02,014
- Mike McD. God. I knew you'd be here.
- Aw, man.

307
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:05,058
- You never let me down.
- I would have been there
every week if you let me, man.

308
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,103
I know, I know. I couldn't
let you see me in this shit hole.

309
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:10,731
- Look at you. You look great, man.
- You too, you too.

310
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:12,941
- Did they toughen you up in there?
- No, no.

311
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,069
It was a piece of cake.
Piece of cake.

312
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:18,614
Man, look at your ride. You've been
prospering while I've been away.

313
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:21,158
- What have you been up to?
- I borrowed it.

314
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:25,746
Whatever. Just get in it and
drive me far away from here.

315
00:22:27,623 --> 00:22:30,417
There's like two whole economies in
there... there's cash and there's trade.

316
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:32,586
So I gotta keep three games
going at once, all right?

317
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,215
A game with the white guys,
a game with the brothers,
and a game with the guards.

318
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:39,343
And the trick is, I gotta take
enough cash off the white guys...

319
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:43,138
to lose it to the guards so that
they keep doing me favors and shit,

320
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:47,226
but I gotta trim enough smokes
off the black guys that I can
trade and keep myself...

321
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:51,897
in the style that I've grown
accustomed to, and all of this
without getting my ass kicked.

322
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,941
So you're working
with a partner?

323
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:56,026
No. Who the hell
am I gonna trust in there?

324
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,195
- It's just me all alone.
- What's this? Come here.

325
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:00,781
- You like that? Isn't that beautiful?
- What is that?

326
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,700
It's like an ace up my sleeve.
What else?

327
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:06,620
Wait till I show you some of my chops,
man. I've gotten pretty blinding.

328
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:09,415
- It's like, it's like, you know...
- All right.

329
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:11,417
It's gonna blow your mind,
blow your mind.

330
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,128
You been working?
Is your game sharp?

331
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,171
No, man,
I'm off it.

332
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:18,465
What, are you...
you gettin' cold cards?

333
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:21,051
No, man,
I mean I quit.

334
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:25,180
What, are you shitting me?
- No, man, l...

335
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:29,143
- I got cleaned out.
- Mike McD? You lost?

336
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:33,313
Yeah, man, l... It was a real
blood game over at KGB's place.

337
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:36,316
You sat down with the Mad Russian
and he emptied your pockets?

338
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,153
Yeah. I didn't want to tell you
while you were in there.

339
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:41,822
I didn't want to
dispirit you like that.

340
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:44,658
Jesus, what were you thinking?
So, you're just a student now?

341
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,828
- What are you doing for money?
- I'm driving Knish's truck.

342
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:51,749
Oh, God, you're killin' me. Mike, Mike,
we gotta get you back on the game.

343
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:54,084
- The old partners here,
we're gonna run like...
- No, no, no, I'm off it.

344
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,795
I mean, I really am. Done.

345
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:00,257
You are, huh? All right. I know a game
perfect for the two of us.

346
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,635
It's a berry patch right outside
New York City... prime pickings.

347
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:08,515
- I'll drop you... I'll drop you off.
- Okay.

348
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,518
- I mean it. No, I'm really off it.
- I know, I know.

349
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:22,654
This is it,
this is it.

350
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:25,324
So get this, here's the plan.
I know this girl Barbara.

351
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:30,037
She's fuckin' hot. I was this close
to bangin' her when they sent me away.

352
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,540
She works as a hostess for all these
fuckin' trust fund babies in here.

353
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:35,542
She got me into
their little game.

354
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:40,047
She introduced me as her cousin
from out of town who loves to
gamble but wants to learn poker.

355
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:42,049
That sounds solid.
That's a nice hookup.

356
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:46,053
It's all the way nice. There's only
one problem. I got this feeling.

357
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:50,682
- What feeling is that, exactly?
- You know this feeling very well.

358
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:52,768
- You know, when you got
your table all set.
- Uh-huh.

359
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:56,105
- Knife, fork, sauce,
A-1, Luger's, but...
- Yeah.

360
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:59,691
- You just don't have the stake.
- Exactly. Glad you understand.

361
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:02,403
A nickel would start me
very nicely.

362
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:04,947
Whoa, Jesus, what have you
been livin' on?

363
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,741
I'm livin' a little light,
I told you.

364
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:11,745
- Anyway, that's $220,
so that'll get you started.
- $220, I mean...

365
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:15,874
Hey, thanks, but I mean,
that's, like, 11 bets.

366
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:18,377
I mean, I can't
even get a table on this...

367
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,338
Good, so forget this game. I'll
straighten you out in the city tomorrow.

368
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:24,091
No way. I gotta get started.

369
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,135
I mean, I'm already
behind here.

370
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:28,637
You just got out.
What's the big fuckin' hurry?

371
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,098
The hurry is, other than you,
my friend, there's about five guys,

372
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:34,726
like, eagerly awaiting
my release.

373
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,271
- How much do you owe?
- Like, ten.

374
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:41,316
- Ten?
- I can't even figure it with the juice.

375
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,529
Hey, look, I can get
started on this easy
if it's you and me working together.

376
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:50,409
I heard you asking before, and I hear
you asking now, but I can't do that.

377
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:53,620
I just can't do that.
I've made promises.

378
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:56,915
Hey, you know what? What am I saying?
I totally understand, I do.

379
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:01,128
It's fine. I'll make a couple of moves
earlier than I would have normally...

380
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:04,423
- But thanks, I appreciate it.
- Premium hands.

381
00:26:04,506 --> 00:26:09,386
- I'll catch you in the city tomorrow?
- Yeah.

382
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,431
Hey, Mike, man.
Fuckin' great to see ya.

383
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:14,600
You too.

384
00:26:57,226 --> 00:27:00,020
In Confessions of
a Winning Poker Player, Jack King said,

385
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:03,398
"Few players recall big pots
they have won, strange as it seems,

386
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:06,151
"but every player can remember
with remarkable accuracy...

387
00:27:06,235 --> 00:27:09,113
the outstanding tough beats
of his career."

388
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:11,156
Seems true to me.
'Cause walking in here,

389
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,534
I can hardly remember
how I built my bankroll,

390
00:27:13,575 --> 00:27:16,662
but I can't stop thinking
of how I lost it.

391
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:18,705
Mike.

392
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:22,376
- Hi.
- Barbara. Worm said
you'd be running a little late.

393
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:24,628
Just follow me.

394
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:34,054
I probably won't even sit.
You know, just kinda keep him company.

395
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:36,223
No, no, that's
not gonna work.

396
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:40,018
Here's the play...
you're my new boyfriend,
you're looking for a regular game.

397
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:43,147
Really? Well, I'm not
much of a card player.

398
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,484
Bullshit. Worm tells me that's
precisely what you are.

399
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:53,407
My cut is 25 per cent.

400
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,910
- I see.
- Good. Come on.

401
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,169
Gentlemen.

402
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:07,421
- This is my boyfriend Michael.
- Hello, Michael.

403
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,549
Be nice to him.

404
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:13,677
- Leave him enough money
to buy me breakfast.

405
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:15,679
- Good luck.
- Thanks, sweetie.

406
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:17,931
Here, why don't you
pull up a chair.

407
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:23,061
- Okay, this one's Chicago.
- You know Chicago?

408
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:25,189
- Uh, remind me.
- Stud game.

409
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:27,441
High spade in the hole
wins half the pot.

410
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:30,611
Okay, well,
deal me in, I guess.

411
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:35,574
- That's you.
- Oh, thanks.

412
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,912
Okay.

413
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,874
- That's two on you, Murph.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

414
00:28:47,044 --> 00:28:49,880
- I'm in.
- I'm gonna make it five.

415
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:52,716
Hey, big spender.

416
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,887
Worm and I fall into our old rhythm
like Clyde Frazier and Pearl Monroe.

417
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,808
We bring out all the old school tricks,
stuff that would
never play in the city...

418
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:02,976
signalling, chip placing,
trapping.

419
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,521
- We even run the old best hand play.
- Raise.

420
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:08,315
I can probably crack the game
just as quickly straight up,

421
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:10,651
but there's no risk
in this room.

422
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:14,780
Now, some people might look down on
Worm's mechanics, call it immoral.

423
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:19,159
But as Canada Bill Jones said, "It's
immoral to let a sucker keep his money."

424
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:22,287
Like they teach you
in One-L...

425
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:24,915
caveat emptor, pal.

426
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:28,961
- I got the boat, queens over.

427
00:29:29,044 --> 00:29:33,173
He asked you if that stung, Birch.

428
00:29:33,257 --> 00:29:35,634
Worm really has become an artist, too.

429
00:29:35,717 --> 00:29:38,929
Discard culls, pickup culls,
overhand run ups, the Double Duke...

430
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:42,975
His technique is flawless.
But his judgment is a little off.

431
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:45,519
A few times, I have to fold the case
on him, just so it won't be obvious.

432
00:29:47,938 --> 00:29:51,984
Still, he plays the part
of the loser to perfection.

433
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:54,194
Flush.

434
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:56,822
I got the full house.
I got the queens over the aces.

435
00:29:56,905 --> 00:29:59,533
Ahh, fuck!
You know what?

436
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:03,620
- Fuck you and your never-ending
string of boats, okay?
- Hey.

437
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:09,918
Well, my Uncle Les says when the
money's gone, it's time to move on,

438
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:13,797
so enjoy it,
you secret handshaking assholes.

439
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:20,220
Murph! Hey, come back any time.
Your money's always good here.

440
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:24,266
- Good night, Mike. See you next time.

441
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:26,852
You guys, uh,
wanna keep playing?

442
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:44,078
How'd we do?
Oh, beautiful.

443
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:46,288
Fuckin' assholes,
they deserved it.

444
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:48,373
All right, $300,
that's your cut.

445
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:50,918
- Thank you very much, boys.
- Hey, you were great. Great.

446
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:54,129
- When can we do this again?
- No, no, it was a one-time thing for me.

447
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:56,423
- Just because.
- Forget it.

448
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:59,551
- Uh, two weeks.
- Two weeks? Okay. Okay.

449
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:03,597
- Hey, thanks a lot. Yeah.

450
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,766
Hey, I had to try, right?

451
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,851
Bye.

452
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:09,895
Hey, how'd you know
I was coming back?

453
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:12,898
That's easy.
Who's your favorite actor?

454
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:16,777
Clint Eastwood. The Outlaw Josey Wales,
man. The Man with No Name.

455
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,904
He always doubles back
for a friend.

456
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:22,783
Hey, we made good time.
Wanna get breakfast?

457
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:26,370
No, I gotta get home. If she
hasn't already changed the locks on me.

458
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,747
Just do me a favor.
Give me five minutes.

459
00:31:28,831 --> 00:31:30,958
Get me
straightened out.

460
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:38,549
This may not look like Teddy's place,
but it ain't the Ivy Leagues either.

461
00:31:38,632 --> 00:31:41,135
So don't fuck around.
You gotta play on your belly.

462
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:43,303
All right.
No problem.

463
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:51,103
Hey, you know I have no problem
with the way you help yourself,

464
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:53,730
but these guys
are fast company.

465
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:55,983
- They'll spot every move.
- Tough customers, huh?

466
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:58,068
- Yeah. I'm serious.
- All right.

467
00:31:58,152 --> 00:32:00,112
- You won't just get
a finger up your spine.
- Okay, I hear ya.

468
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:02,322
- I'm playing straight.

469
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:15,377
Michael McDermott.

470
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:17,588
- How you doin', Mikey?
- Good, how you doin'?

471
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:20,048
Good. You know, um,

472
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:22,134
the computer tried
to delete you last week.

473
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:24,136
- Oh, yeah?
- But I knew you'd be back.

474
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:26,513
Oh, no, I'm not back,
I just...

475
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:28,932
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

476
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:31,935
Um, this is Les Murphy.
He's like my brother.

477
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:33,979
Call me Worm.

478
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:37,858
- Hey. Don't wiggle away.

479
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:40,527
Hey, what's she
wearing the button for?

480
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:43,530
They're wired right into the precinct.
They got 'em on the payroll.

481
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:52,372
- What are they playing?
- Uh, 20-40 forced rotation.

482
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:55,167
It's the only game going
right now.

483
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,878
Is that Fat Greggie sitting 20-40?
The game's that soft?

484
00:32:57,961 --> 00:33:02,424
Yeah. It's a real live game.
So, you guys gonna play?

485
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:04,426
- No.
- Hell, yeah, I'm gonna play.

486
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,179
- Oh, come on, you're not
gonna walk away from this.
- Not gonna happen.

487
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:10,057
Mike, we could cut
this room up in an hour.

488
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:16,772
All right, run along, then.
Say hi to her for me.

489
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:20,984
- Me, too.
- I will. Take care of him.

490
00:33:24,947 --> 00:33:27,491
Jesus. What a fuckin' waste.

491
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:30,035
Do you believe that?
She's really got him by the balls.

492
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:32,913
- That's not so bad, is it?
- Depends on the grip.

493
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:35,457
- Come on, give me $2,000.
- On the finger?

494
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:38,460
You heard Mike.
He's good for it. Come on.

495
00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:41,880
Look, I'm gonna triple that
in half an hour, princess. Let's go.

496
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:44,299
Okay.

497
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:04,236
Hey.

498
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:06,613
Reunion run a little late?

499
00:34:06,697 --> 00:34:09,491
I was gonna call,
but I didn't want to wake you up.

500
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:12,077
It's okay.
I wasn't sleeping.

501
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:14,747
Well, why don't you change
and we'll get a cab.

502
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:19,418
Um, why don't you just go ahead,
and I'm gonna jump in the shower.

503
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:23,255
And if I miss a little bit
of the Mulligan meeting,
just cover for me, all right?

504
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:33,807
Hey.

505
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:37,978
At least give me a story.
You know, I mean...

506
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,355
I mean, tell me you were
out drinking till you threw up.

507
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:43,650
Tell me you were getting
lap dances over at Scores.

508
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:47,571
- I don't care, just give me something.
- I was entertaining Worm.

509
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:50,282
- Uh-huh.
- The least I can do for the guy.

510
00:34:50,365 --> 00:34:53,994
- So, you were nowhere near a card game.
- Sweetie.

511
00:34:54,078 --> 00:34:56,288
What?
I'm asking you a question.

512
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:59,833
- I'm just...
- No. I was nowhere near a card game.

513
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,169
All right?

514
00:35:02,252 --> 00:35:04,171
All right.
I'll wait for you.

515
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:39,415
I mean, the key is a seamless
passing of the baton among the team.

516
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:43,043
I think the most important thing
is to be respectful to
the judges but not obsequious.

517
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:45,087
Now, wait a minute.
Make sure to be deferential.

518
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,214
Gene Marinacci won't buy
deferential.

519
00:35:47,297 --> 00:35:49,341
Oh, it's Gene, is it?

520
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:52,344
Well, I knew there was a reason
why you were lead counsel,

521
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:55,347
and it's got nothing to do
with your punctuality.

522
00:35:55,431 --> 00:35:57,349
Sorry.
I couldn't find a cab.

523
00:35:57,433 --> 00:36:01,311
Anyway, when you make
the opening remarks, make sure
you stick to the fact pattern.

524
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:05,357
And use the right cites.
Use book cites, not Lexis.

525
00:36:05,441 --> 00:36:07,484
Hi, Jo.

526
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,486
- Long time.
- Knish. How are you?

527
00:36:11,113 --> 00:36:14,158
The same.

528
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:17,536
I don't mean to interrupt
you future magistrates and noblemen,

529
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,580
but l, uh,
I need a word.

530
00:36:21,457 --> 00:36:23,417
- Um...
- It's important.

531
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,919
Okay. Excuse me.

532
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:28,046
Sorry.

533
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:32,760
- I'll act as lead counsel.
- It's all right, Kelly.

534
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:34,928
We were gonna
take a break anyway.

535
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:37,514
Coffee time.

536
00:36:40,934 --> 00:36:44,229
The guy's a cheat.
He always has been.

537
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:46,940
Right now, he's over at Chesterfield's,
ruining your reputation...

538
00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:48,942
with every lousy second
he deals.

539
00:36:49,026 --> 00:36:51,570
Shit. I told him.
Did anybody else see him?

540
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:54,823
Nobody saw... I heard it.
Snapping sound gave it away.

541
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:57,326
I didn't know him,
I might not have noticed.

542
00:36:57,409 --> 00:37:00,162
I turn around, and I see him
with the mechanic's grip, I know.

543
00:37:00,245 --> 00:37:02,456
- You want one?
- Did you give him the office?

544
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:05,459
I tried to warn him, but
he looked right through me.

545
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:07,586
- All right, I'll go get him.
- No, no, no. He's okay now.

546
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:10,380
Most of those Georges are at the tail
end of a 36-hour session.

547
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:14,009
They can't see straight.
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

548
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:16,386
But if he's still there
when Roman and Maurice start their game,

549
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,388
he's gonna wish he was
still inside.

550
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:20,390
I'm gonna go get him.

551
00:37:22,392 --> 00:37:26,230
Amarillo Slim, the greatest
proposition gambler of all time,

552
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,357
held to his father's maxim...

553
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,735
"You can shear a sheep many times,
but skin him only once."

554
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:34,071
Gotta bet my jacks.

555
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:37,032
This is a lesson
Worm's never bothered to learn.

556
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:39,660
- Hey, guys.

557
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:41,662
English only at the table,
no Russian.

558
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:44,832
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

559
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:47,501
If you want to see
this seventh card, you're gonna
stop speaking fuckin' Sputnik.

560
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:50,295
- Oh, da, motherfucker.
- You're worried we might work together.

561
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:52,339
I'm sure you're just talking
about perogies...

562
00:37:52,423 --> 00:37:54,466
and snow and shit, but let's
cut it out, all right?

563
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,718
There's the river,
down and dirty.

564
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,473
I think you got that ace,
Roman, but I'm gonna pay for it.

565
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:04,977
Okay, well,
I got the jacks. Come on.

566
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:07,187
- Ace.
- Oh, you got it.
- And six.

567
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:09,356
Wow, two pair.
But I got sevens, too, though.

568
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,360
- With my jacks.
- Motherfucker, slow rolling me
like that.

569
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:15,446
You said just jacks.

570
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:17,448
But you made me for the sevens,
Maurice. You're a player.

571
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:20,576
- Fuck!
- Hey, come on! Don't be a fuckin' baby.

572
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:22,745
- Hey, Maurice.
- Hey.

573
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:25,330
Hey, Mike, you here to play?
Come on, we need some new blood.

574
00:38:25,414 --> 00:38:28,333
They're putting a fucking bracelet
on me tomorrow for four months.

575
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,878
- I already stuck two racks.
- Well, have a good rest, man.

576
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:32,880
Can I talk to you
for a second, Cosmonaut?

577
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:36,049
No, man, I'm on a roll.
This is a very emotional game.

578
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:38,093
Gotta do it.

579
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:40,679
- I counted these.

580
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:42,723
Leave it.
It's fine.

581
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:50,773
- What's going on?
- Where are you at?

582
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:53,901
I was pumped up eight G's. I was ready
to go on a run when you came along.

583
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:57,029
- All right, listen.
- Hey, wait, I want a hot dog.

584
00:38:57,112 --> 00:38:59,865
You're in town for five fuckin' minutes,
you already got a sign on your back.

585
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:03,035
Oh, what, that fuckin' Knish
rat me out?

586
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:05,079
You gotta stop listening
to that guy, man.

587
00:39:05,162 --> 00:39:07,456
He sees all the angles, but
he doesn't have the balls to play one.

588
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:09,792
Hey, that guy hasn't had to
work in 15 years, Worm.

589
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,211
You don't think that's work,
what he does?

590
00:39:12,252 --> 00:39:14,588
Grinding it out on his fuckin'
leather ass? No, thank you.

591
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,591
I thought so, too, all right?
Now I know what real work is.

592
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:20,219
Speaking of which,
are you even gonna get a job?

593
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,513
Or are you just gonna go back
to printing those credit cards?

594
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:24,848
- Huh? You gonna go away again?
- I wasn't printing.

595
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:27,768
I was distributing. Distributing.
It's different, okay?

596
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,978
Second of all, I'm never
going back there.

597
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:32,439
Stop worrying
so much, okay?

598
00:39:32,523 --> 00:39:34,441
Come here.

599
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:39,738
I just want you to think
long term, all right? Be smart.

600
00:39:39,822 --> 00:39:42,658
Every place in Manhattan,
they all keep books, all right?

601
00:39:42,741 --> 00:39:45,953
If you get listed as a mechanic,
then not only are you gonna
get the shit kicked out of you,

602
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:48,747
you're not gonna get a fuckin' game
anywhere in New York.

603
00:39:48,831 --> 00:39:51,125
It's stupid.
It's just bad business.

604
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:54,211
Look, this is what I love about you...
you think about the big picture.

605
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:56,213
That's great, okay?
But it's not me.

606
00:39:56,296 --> 00:39:58,549
I don't play the game straight up,
and then if I lose,

607
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:00,551
go get some real work
or something, okay?

608
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:02,553
I see a mark,
I take him down.

609
00:40:02,636 --> 00:40:04,638
That's what I do.
That's the way I live.

610
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:07,266
I know. Listen, you're the guy
who taught me all the angles.

611
00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:10,310
- But I'm not the guy
with my nose open right now.
- Aw, come on.

612
00:40:10,394 --> 00:40:13,730
I'm not gonna preach to you, but those
two guys in there, they're not rabbits.

613
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:17,067
Roman and Maurice?
They're Russian outfit guys.

614
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:19,987
Not as bad as KGB, but you don't want
to be fuckin' with those guys.

615
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,074
With those fake
Versace shirts and shit? Jesus.

616
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:28,120
Look, you still got time.
Just go back in there, right?

617
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:30,122
Lose their fuckin' money
back to 'em, all right?

618
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:32,207
Just make it look good.
Just catch a run of real shitty cards.

619
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,293
- Give it back to 'em.
- I can't. I can't.

620
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:37,129
I gotta put some scratch together, man.
I gotta get somethin' going.

621
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:40,507
Then go out to suburbia, man. Play
in a fuckin' dentist's game, okay?

622
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:44,762
- Go to Swan Meadow,
play in the golf pro game.
- That's an idea.

623
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:48,307
I'll definitely do that,
but I can't dump to these guys.

624
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,101
You got to.

625
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:53,103
All right,
whatever, whatever.

626
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:55,939
Meet me at Stromboli's
in half an hour, all right?

627
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:57,983
I can't, I gotta go.
I have a meeting.

628
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,985
And then I gotta go to fuckin' Queens.
I gotta load the truck.

629
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,738
Jesus, man, you're such
a fuckin' workin' man now.
I'm never gonna see you.

630
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:06,366
- Make it look good.
I mean it, make it look good.
- You know me.

631
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:20,672
- So, how'd you do?
- Ah, so-so.

632
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:24,551
Six thousand,
two thousand.

633
00:41:24,593 --> 00:41:28,180
Oh, hold on.
Two more.

634
00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:30,224
All right, so it's
ten grand total,

635
00:41:30,265 --> 00:41:32,226
take back the two we lent you,
give you the white meat.

636
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:34,269
You know what?

637
00:41:34,353 --> 00:41:36,855
Why don't you give me
all of it?

638
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:39,316
Usually, credit players
only leave with their profit.

639
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:41,652
Otherwise, the juice starts
five points a week on Mike.

640
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:43,654
Oh, okay.
We'll owe you.

641
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:03,048
Hey. I've been looking
all over for you.

642
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,050
Didn't want to
be found.

643
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:08,429
You know, Petrovsky waited and waited.
So did the rest of the group.

644
00:42:08,512 --> 00:42:11,432
- Jo, look, I missed one meeting.
- It's not about the meeting.

645
00:42:11,473 --> 00:42:15,018
I don't care about the meeting. Do
you even know why I left this morning?

646
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:18,188
- I found that gangster's roll
in your pocket.
- It's not what you think.

647
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:22,401
- It's not what you think.
- Who do you think I am?
You lie right to my face?

648
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:25,571
Look, old days at least
you never lied.

649
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:27,740
You lost everything,
but at least you never lied.

650
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:33,871
Jo, this wasn't even a real game.
This was like Wiffle Ball.

651
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:35,956
- Can you lose your rent
playing Wiffle Ball?
- No, I couldn't lose.

652
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:38,584
- That's the point.
- No, Mike, you can lose.

653
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:41,628
I watched you, I stood by you while
you lost everything before.

654
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:44,423
- I don't think I can go
through that with you again.
- Jo, I wasn't gonna lose!

655
00:42:44,465 --> 00:42:46,800
Why does this still seem
like gambling to you?

656
00:42:46,842 --> 00:42:49,303
Why do you think the same five guys
make it to the final table...

657
00:42:49,386 --> 00:42:51,889
at the World Series of Poker
every single year?

658
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:54,099
What are they, the luckiest guys
in Las Vegas?

659
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:58,228
- It's a skill game, Jo.
- Great. So why'd you
have to lie to me?

660
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:02,483
- Because I knew you wouldn't understand.
- Understand what?

661
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:06,487
Last night, I sat down
at this card table.

662
00:43:06,528 --> 00:43:11,825
I felt alive for the first time since
I got busted at KGB's joint, okay?

663
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:14,912
You just told me you felt alive for
the first time at a fucking card table.

664
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:18,791
- No, what...
- What's that supposed to
make me understand?

665
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:48,654
Midnight, gettin' uptight
Where are you

666
00:43:48,737 --> 00:43:51,156
- You said you need me
but it's quarter to 2:00
- I heard you was out.

667
00:43:51,198 --> 00:43:53,700
Hey, fuckin' Grama.
How you doin'?

668
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:55,953
- I was just thinkin' about you.
You know, I could use you.
- Oh, yeah?

669
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:58,497
See me in, like, two weeks.
I'll put you back on the payroll.

670
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:03,043
Well, I got some bad news for ya, Worm.
I'm out on my own now.

671
00:44:03,085 --> 00:44:05,587
- Really?
- Yeah.

672
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:07,756
Go figure.

673
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,218
There were a lot of angry people when
you went away. A lot of people were mad.

674
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,595
I know, Grama, that's why I'm trying
to put together a roll here.

675
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,681
A lot of people coming up to me,
asking if I could help,

676
00:44:15,722 --> 00:44:17,724
asking if I knew
where to find you.

677
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:20,394
- So, it got me to thinkin'.
- Really, you thinkin' now? That's big.

678
00:44:20,477 --> 00:44:23,647
Hey, Jesus! Come on!
Take it easy.

679
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:26,150
It's just
a friend of mine.

680
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:29,570
Hey! Easy, easy, easy, easy.
God!

681
00:44:29,653 --> 00:44:32,740
Get the fuck outta here.
What did I say?

682
00:44:32,823 --> 00:44:36,076
- Hey, man, take it easy!
- Get the fuck outta here!

683
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:40,456
Okay.
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

684
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:44,042
Instead of you owing 15 grand spread out
to five guys, you owe 25 to me.

685
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:46,587
What? Where the fuck
do you get off? 25 grand?

686
00:44:46,628 --> 00:44:49,214
Where the fuck
do I get off?

687
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:51,258
Ohh.

688
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:55,262
Here's how it is. 25 grand,
and the juice is still runnin'.

689
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:57,806
Jesus Christ.

690
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,017
What the fuck are you doin', man?
You were my partner.

691
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,019
No, no,
I was your lackey.

692
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:04,021
But I learned
a few things, Worm.

693
00:45:04,104 --> 00:45:07,858
I consolidated
your outstanding debt.

694
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:11,195
Where'd you get
the scratch for that?

695
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:14,490
You've been rolling fags
in the Village again.

696
00:45:14,573 --> 00:45:16,992
- Still a wise ass. Unbelievable.

697
00:45:17,076 --> 00:45:19,620
What I did was go partners
with an old friend of yours.

698
00:45:19,703 --> 00:45:23,040
Teddy KGB backed me.

699
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:25,584
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

700
00:45:26,668 --> 00:45:30,255
Teddy's got plenty of goons.

701
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:32,424
Why would he put you
under his flag?

702
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:37,221
Because as soon as he heard your name,
he became real excited for the prospect.

703
00:45:37,304 --> 00:45:39,932
What, so you bought me up, Grama?

704
00:45:39,973 --> 00:45:43,268
Yeah, got a real sweet deal, too.
30 cents on the dollar.

705
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,438
There's not a lot of faith in you
out there in the business community.

706
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:49,399
Great, so you're a banker now, Grama.
That's really classy.

707
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:53,320
Not exactly. I don't have to tell you
my collection methods.

708
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:55,322
Oh, God. All right, look.

709
00:45:55,406 --> 00:45:57,366
Just take it easy,
all right?

710
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:59,493
I'll scrape something together,
and I'll find you this week.

711
00:45:59,576 --> 00:46:01,870
- That's just what I figured.
- No, no, no.

712
00:46:01,954 --> 00:46:05,833
- So I'm gonna take what you
got on you right now.
- Here. Fine.

713
00:46:05,874 --> 00:46:09,461
Have yourself
a ball, okay?

714
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:14,049
God!

715
00:46:14,133 --> 00:46:16,844
Damn!

716
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:31,024
Excuse me.

717
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:44,538
Mind if I sit?

718
00:46:44,621 --> 00:46:47,040
Michael.

719
00:46:47,124 --> 00:46:50,043
Please, please.
Sit, sit.

720
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:54,673
That was a nifty trick
the other night.

721
00:46:56,717 --> 00:46:58,844
- It was wonderful.
- Thank you.

722
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:02,639
Marinacci and the D.A. were ready to cut
cards for your services at that point.

723
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:09,021
Of course,
it was an altogether different trick,
that disappearing act...

724
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:11,064
you pulled today
at your group's meeting.

725
00:47:11,148 --> 00:47:15,861
- Yeah. Well, I figure
I owe you an explanation.
- Ah, not to me.

726
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:18,030
I'm sure there's
a good reason you left.

727
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:20,407
You'll just have to
work harder. Prepare.

728
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:23,911
- And smooth things out with the others.

729
00:47:23,952 --> 00:47:27,247
Right. Yeah.
Okay.

730
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:30,959
- Okay, well, thanks.
- Stay. Take a drink.

731
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:34,338
- Jamie?
- Yeah?

732
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:37,049
- Another glass, darling.
- Sure.

733
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:39,218
- What are you drinking?
- Gin. Always gin.

734
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:41,261
- Here you go.
- Thanks, dear.

735
00:47:41,303 --> 00:47:43,680
Thank you.

736
00:47:43,764 --> 00:47:47,101
I know a magician doesn't
divulge his secrets, but...

737
00:47:47,142 --> 00:47:49,812
I'm no magician.

738
00:47:49,895 --> 00:47:53,273
Well, if it wasn't magic,

739
00:47:53,357 --> 00:47:55,943
how did you know
what everyone held?

740
00:47:56,026 --> 00:47:58,946
It's a combination
of things.

741
00:47:59,029 --> 00:48:01,073
Um, I was watching
when the cards came out.

742
00:48:01,156 --> 00:48:05,619
That's... That's just an old habit
with me, like breathing.

743
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:07,746
You watch the cards.

744
00:48:07,788 --> 00:48:11,250
I watch the cards also, but I watch
the players reacting to the cards.

745
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,877
That's how I knew the D.A.
made his two pair,

746
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:16,380
and Judge Kaplan
missed the flush.

747
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:18,799
I was watching their eyes
when they checked their river cards.

748
00:48:18,882 --> 00:48:22,136
- Their faces tell you everything.
- You watch the man.

749
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:26,390
l... I never knew you had
to calculate so much at cards.

750
00:48:32,062 --> 00:48:35,816
All right, here's the thing.
You only play premium hands.

751
00:48:35,899 --> 00:48:38,694
You only start
with jacks or better split,

752
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:41,280
nines or better wired,
three high cards to a flush.

753
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:44,199
If it's good enough to call, you gotta
be in there raising, all right?

754
00:48:44,283 --> 00:48:48,162
I mean, tight, but aggressive.
And I do mean aggressive.
That's your style, Professor.

755
00:48:48,245 --> 00:48:50,998
I mean, you gotta...
you gotta think of it as a war.

756
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:55,127
You are officially never
invited to our game again.

757
00:48:57,296 --> 00:49:01,091
I don't blame you. Put a guy
like me in a game like that,
the cards don't even matter.

758
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:03,093
I'll play it blind.

759
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:08,348
Michael,

760
00:49:08,432 --> 00:49:11,518
- May I tell you a story?
- Please.

761
00:49:11,602 --> 00:49:16,899
For generations,
men of my family have been rabbis.

762
00:49:16,982 --> 00:49:20,027
In Israel,
before that in Europe.

763
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,822
It was to be my calling.
I was quite a prodigy.

764
00:49:23,864 --> 00:49:26,283
The pride of my yeshiva.

765
00:49:26,366 --> 00:49:28,577
The elders said I had
a 40-year-old's understanding...

766
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:32,331
of the midrash
by the time I was 12.

767
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:34,666
But by the time
I was 13,

768
00:49:36,168 --> 00:49:38,504
I knew I could never
be a rabbi.

769
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:40,506
Why not?

770
00:49:40,547 --> 00:49:43,884
Because for all
I understood of the Talmud,

771
00:49:45,886 --> 00:49:48,555
I never saw
God there.

772
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:51,391
- You couldn't lie to yourself.
- I tried.

773
00:49:51,475 --> 00:49:53,393
Tried like crazy.

774
00:49:53,477 --> 00:49:56,730
I mean, people were
counting on me.

775
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:59,858
But yours is
a respectable profession.

776
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:01,902
Not to my family.

777
00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:06,323
My parents were destroyed,
devastated by my decision.

778
00:50:08,158 --> 00:50:13,455
My father sent me away
to New York...

779
00:50:13,539 --> 00:50:16,291
to live
with distant cousins.

780
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:19,169
Eventually, l...
I found my place,

781
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:22,005
my life's work.

782
00:50:23,424 --> 00:50:25,843
What then?

783
00:50:25,926 --> 00:50:28,846
I immersed myself fully,
I studied the minutiae,

784
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:31,348
I learned everything I could
about the law.

785
00:50:31,432 --> 00:50:34,393
I mean, I felt deeply inside
that it was what I was born to do.

786
00:50:37,646 --> 00:50:41,024
- And did your parents get over it?
- No.

787
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:45,237
I always hoped
that I would find...

788
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:48,240
some way to change
their minds, but...

789
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:53,871
They were
inconsolable.

790
00:50:55,873 --> 00:50:58,917
My father never spoke
to me again.

791
00:51:02,921 --> 00:51:06,258
If you had to do it
all over again,

792
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,137
would you make
the same choices?

793
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:12,473
What choice?

794
00:51:15,976 --> 00:51:19,146
The last thing I took away
from the yeshiva is this...

795
00:51:21,398 --> 00:51:23,817
We can't run
from who we are.

796
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,322
Our destiny chooses us.

797
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:34,286
Hey.
L'chayim.

798
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,059
Hey.

799
00:51:57,142 --> 00:51:59,103
Hey, where you been?
I've been freezing my ass off.

800
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:02,773
- What happened?
- Ah, ran into a door.
Don't worry about it.

801
00:52:02,856 --> 00:52:05,943
- What happened?
- Hey! She crossed her legs
too fast, all right?

802
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:08,153
- Just mind your own business.
- You comin' up?

803
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:10,531
No, I've been standing out here
all this time just to say hi.

804
00:52:10,572 --> 00:52:13,200
Listen, things haven't
been that smooth on the home front,

805
00:52:13,283 --> 00:52:15,869
so tone it down
a little, all right?

806
00:52:15,953 --> 00:52:18,580
- Tone down what, motherfucker?
- Great.

807
00:52:18,664 --> 00:52:21,166
- Never mind.

808
00:52:23,585 --> 00:52:26,547
When you become a big shot lawyer,
could you find us an elevator building?

809
00:52:26,588 --> 00:52:28,549
Shut up.

810
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:35,305
What, did you
get robbed?

811
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:38,058
Um, not exactly.

812
00:52:39,184 --> 00:52:42,980
Wait, wait, wait.
Did she split on you?

813
00:52:43,063 --> 00:52:46,108
Oh, God.

814
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:51,864
Oh, my God. Mike, she made off
with your sheets.

815
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:54,408
I always told her she'd be
a good card player.

816
00:52:54,491 --> 00:52:57,828
- Know exactly when
to release a shitty hand.
- Come on, Mike, forget that.

817
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:00,706
This girl is obviously
wrapped way too tight for living.

818
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:04,835
No, she was a good... I knew it.
I fuckin' knew it.

819
00:53:09,923 --> 00:53:11,925
It's depressing.

820
00:53:11,967 --> 00:53:14,052
You can't trust 'em.
You can't trust 'em at all.

821
00:53:14,136 --> 00:53:17,931
I mean, look at you.
You domesticated yourself for this girl.

822
00:53:17,973 --> 00:53:20,768
You took yourself out of the life.
You walked the fuckin' line for her.

823
00:53:20,851 --> 00:53:24,229
And the minute you want a little
of it back, she walks out on you.

824
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:27,232
It's just like
the saying says, you know?

825
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:32,237
In the poker game of life,
women are the rake.

826
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:35,616
- They are the fuckin' rake.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

827
00:53:35,657 --> 00:53:39,119
What saying?

828
00:53:39,203 --> 00:53:43,707
I don't know.
But there oughta be one.

829
00:53:46,627 --> 00:53:51,465
- You know what cheers me up
when I'm feelin' shitty?
- What?

830
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:54,093
Rolled up aces over kings.

831
00:53:57,513 --> 00:53:59,473
- That right?
- Yeah.

832
00:53:59,515 --> 00:54:03,852
Check raising stupid tourists
and taking huge pots off 'em.

833
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:08,440
- Yeah?
- Stacks and towers of checks
I can't even see over.

834
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:12,986
Playin' all night,
high-limit Hold' Em at the Taj.

835
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,657
- Where the sand turns to gold.
- Fuck it, let's go.

836
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:20,744
- Don't tease me.
- Let's play some fuckin' cards.

837
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:36,635
The poker room at the Mirage in Vegas...

838
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:39,513
is the center of
the poker universe.

839
00:54:39,555 --> 00:54:41,849
Doyle Brunson, Johnny Chan,
Phil Helmuth...

840
00:54:41,932 --> 00:54:44,184
The legends consider it
their office.

841
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:46,186
Every couple of days
a new millionaire shows up...

842
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:48,439
wanting to beat
a world champion.

843
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:51,692
Usually they go home
with nothing but a story.

844
00:54:51,734 --> 00:54:53,819
Down here, the millionaires are scarce
or they're playing craps,

845
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:56,363
but there's still
plenty of money for the taking.

846
00:54:56,447 --> 00:54:58,365
In fact, on the weekends
you can't get a game in the city,

847
00:54:58,449 --> 00:55:01,660
because all the New York rounders
are taking care of the tourists here.

848
00:55:01,702 --> 00:55:05,289
Hey, hey, why don't you warm up
a seat for me. I'll catch up with you.

849
00:55:05,372 --> 00:55:07,708
- What?
- Look.

850
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:10,627
- I got certain needs
I gotta attend to, okay?
- Hey, good.

851
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:13,046
- I mean, I'm overdue.
- Good, man, hey, I was startin'
to wonder about you.

852
00:55:13,088 --> 00:55:16,925
I thought, maybe, you know,
the boys upstate brought about
a few changes in you.

853
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:20,846
Hey, in your dreams,
lover.

854
00:55:28,395 --> 00:55:30,397
- Hey, Mikey!
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

855
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:34,026
This is beautiful.
Welcome to the Chesterfield south.

856
00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:36,403
- Ho!
- Changing $500.

857
00:55:36,445 --> 00:55:39,281
Come all the way to Atlantic City
just to see your mugs, huh?

858
00:55:39,364 --> 00:55:41,408
Twice in one week.

859
00:55:41,492 --> 00:55:44,495
For someone who don't play, you spend
a lot of time in card rooms.

860
00:55:44,578 --> 00:55:46,497
This is what
I like to see, huh?

861
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,666
Mike McDermott where he belongs...
sittin' with the scumbags.

862
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,377
Tellin' jokes,
draggin' the occasional pot.

863
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:56,381
Occasional? Yeah, like my ex-wife
occasionally went out with other men.

864
00:55:56,465 --> 00:56:00,928
Forget her, Face. I was actually gonna
try and make some real money tonight.

865
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:04,640
But in honor of Mike's
alley-like return to the ring,

866
00:56:04,723 --> 00:56:06,683
I'll sit with you all
for a while.

867
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:08,811
Hey, don't do us
any favors, Knish.

868
00:56:08,894 --> 00:56:12,189
- They're about to go to
the board to fill these seats.
- Bet it.

869
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:15,776
I raise. You know, if we wanted
to take each other's rolls,

870
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:17,778
we could have just
stayed home.

871
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:21,407
These two have no idea...

872
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:24,910
what they're about to
walk into.

873
00:56:24,952 --> 00:56:26,954
Down here to have a good time,
they figure...

874
00:56:26,995 --> 00:56:30,374
why not give poker a try?

875
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:32,543
After all, how different
can it be from the home games...

876
00:56:32,626 --> 00:56:34,586
they've played
their whole lives?

877
00:56:36,672 --> 00:56:41,135
All the luck in the world isn't
gonna change things for these guys.

878
00:56:41,218 --> 00:56:44,471
They're simply overmatched.

879
00:56:46,723 --> 00:56:50,602
We're not playing together,
but then again, we're not playing
against each other either.

880
00:56:50,644 --> 00:56:54,898
It's like the Nature Channel. You don't
see piranhas eating each other, do you?

881
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,951
They wear their tells
like signs around their necks.

882
00:57:05,993 --> 00:57:08,996
Facial tics, nervous fingers.

883
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:10,998
A hand over a mouth.

884
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:14,001
The way a cigarette
is smoked.

885
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:17,171
Little unconscious gestures
that reveal the cards in their hands.

886
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:19,673
We catch everything.

887
00:57:19,715 --> 00:57:22,301
If a fish acts strong,
he's bluffing.

888
00:57:22,384 --> 00:57:25,846
If he acts meek,
he's got a hand. It's that simple.

889
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:34,313
- How are you, you workaholics?
- Worm.

890
00:57:34,396 --> 00:57:36,982
Good to see ya.
Glad you're out.

891
00:57:37,024 --> 00:57:39,151
Number's changed,
of course.

892
00:57:39,193 --> 00:57:41,320
Lotta games this weekend,
so you're gonna need the number.

893
00:57:41,403 --> 00:57:43,363
- I'll give you a ring.
- Hey, Worm?

894
00:57:43,405 --> 00:57:45,699
Do they allow people like you
in places like this?

895
00:57:45,741 --> 00:57:49,328
Zagosh, when you get yourself a job,
then you can be my fuckin' P.O.

896
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:51,330
How about that?

897
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:53,999
Now, let's get started,
shall we?

898
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:56,043
I'm sorry, sir.

899
00:57:56,085 --> 00:57:58,796
You can't take chips
from another player at the table.

900
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:00,839
We all know each other here.

901
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:03,717
We're like friends, so if nobody
complains, do you have a problem?

902
00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:05,719
- It's all right.
- No problem.

903
00:58:05,803 --> 00:58:10,349
- Sir, you have to buy 'em from me.

904
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:15,354
Fuck this low-limit shit.
Can we go get something to eat?
I got comped at the noodle bar.

905
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:17,272
I want to talk to you.

906
00:58:17,356 --> 00:58:19,525
Look who's treatin'
to a free meal.

907
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:22,778
Don't let that M.S.G. fuck
up your head more than it is, Mikey.

908
00:58:22,861 --> 00:58:26,990
You keep grinding out that rent money,
Joe. It's noble work you're doing.

909
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:30,285
So, hey, uh,
Nick the Greek.

910
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:32,287
What's with
kitin' my checks?

911
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:36,458
- I'm on empty, that's why.
- You are? You're tapped again?

912
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:38,752
I mean...
How much was the hooker?

913
00:58:38,836 --> 00:58:43,257
- Mike, please. Relaxation therapist.

914
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,300
Okay?

915
00:58:45,384 --> 00:58:47,761
- It's not where it went.
- Wait a minute.

916
00:58:47,803 --> 00:58:49,763
It went to
Roman and Maurice?

917
00:58:49,805 --> 00:58:52,391
I told you, man, you didn't have to
give it all back to 'em.

918
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:55,018
Take a little money
for your time, you know?

919
00:58:55,102 --> 00:58:57,062
Hey, that's not
where it went either.

920
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,650
- I ran into Grama tonight.
- Yeah?

921
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:03,694
Yeah. He took
everything I had.

922
00:59:03,777 --> 00:59:06,113
You're kiddin' me.
Wait, who's he working for?

923
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:10,451
Well, he's sorta
out on his own.

924
00:59:10,534 --> 00:59:13,245
This fucker went around
and bought up all my debt. Grama.

925
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:16,874
That turncoat motherfucker.
Are you kiddin' me?

926
00:59:16,957 --> 00:59:19,376
So what do you owe him?

927
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,712
I don't know. By his crazy fuckin'
gorilla math?

928
00:59:21,795 --> 00:59:23,714
Like, 15.

929
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:26,759
- Fifteen? Fifteen?
- Yeah, I mean...

930
00:59:26,842 --> 00:59:29,887
He says the juice has been running
the entire time on my ten.

931
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,930
- So, it's just like...
- Why didn't you tell me that, man?

932
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:34,516
Why did you not tell me that?
I could have paid that off.

933
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,852
- I had the... I had the money.
- Hey!

934
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:39,772
I'm not gonna sit in the can and have
my friend paying down my debt.

935
00:59:39,813 --> 00:59:41,774
I'm not a leech,
all right?

936
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:44,777
We can help each other, like always.
That's why we're here.

937
00:59:44,818 --> 00:59:47,196
That's... That's why we gotta
get in the bigger game.

938
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:49,198
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- All right. All right.

939
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:51,658
- Listen, man, I'll help you.
You know I'll help you, man.
- Yeah?

940
00:59:51,742 --> 00:59:54,078
- I mean, fuck that guy.
We'll figure something out.
- Yeah.

941
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:01,835
How long
should we wait?

942
01:00:01,877 --> 01:00:05,464
I suggest we wait another five minutes,
and then choose another lead counsel.

943
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:12,012
Here he comes.

944
01:00:14,056 --> 01:00:17,893
Mr. McDermott,
perhaps we can begin now.

945
01:00:17,976 --> 01:00:20,896
I'm so sorry I'm late.

946
01:00:20,979 --> 01:00:25,651
Come to order in the matter
of Slater v. New York State
Higher Education Services.

947
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:29,822
The facts have been stipulated,
the briefs have been read.

948
01:00:29,863 --> 01:00:33,325
Lead counsel for plaintiff,
Mr. McDermott,

949
01:00:34,785 --> 01:00:37,996
please proceed
with oral arguments now.

950
01:00:38,038 --> 01:00:40,374
If that is convenient
for you.

951
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:46,880
Yes, it is, and again,
I'm sorry, ah, that I'm late.

952
01:00:46,964 --> 01:00:49,716
Um...

953
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:53,220
Well, I think clearly
the, uh...

954
01:00:53,262 --> 01:00:58,183
the case which controls the issue at bar
would be, uh, Texas v. Johnson,

955
01:00:58,225 --> 01:01:01,728
- Which holds...
- Texas v. Johnson?

956
01:01:01,812 --> 01:01:05,732
Mr. McDermott, that is a Supreme Court
free speech case...

957
01:01:05,774 --> 01:01:08,569
that has no bearing
in the premises.

958
01:01:08,652 --> 01:01:12,197
Each group was apprised to ignore
that aspect of this matter...

959
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,285
and focus instead on the idea
of de facto segregation.

960
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:20,289
Right. Um, well...

961
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:22,291
Mr. McDermott has
been unreachable,

962
01:01:22,374 --> 01:01:24,585
so I'll take over,
if it pleases the court.

963
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:28,881
Someone saying something meaningful
would please us a great deal.

964
01:01:30,424 --> 01:01:33,135
What we have here is a clear case
of gerrymandering,

965
01:01:33,218 --> 01:01:36,138
impacting schoolchildren
and schools in the district...

966
01:01:36,221 --> 01:01:39,224
that was created solely
to separate students by race.

967
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:42,895
Although not dispositive, the student
body is more than 99 percent white.

968
01:01:42,978 --> 01:01:45,481
Well, that
was impressive.

969
01:01:45,564 --> 01:01:49,651
Usually you have to know something about
a case to give an opening statement.

970
01:01:49,735 --> 01:01:52,071
Guys, what...
what can I say?

971
01:01:52,112 --> 01:01:56,575
Hey, it worked out great
for me, McDermott. I think
I actually impressed Marinacci.

972
01:01:56,658 --> 01:01:58,619
Jo.

973
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,997
- Jo. Jo.
- What?

974
01:02:02,081 --> 01:02:06,210
We're not gonna talk?
You left me pretty quick there.

975
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:09,463
- You make it sound
as if it was my decision.
- Well, it wasn't mine.

976
01:02:09,546 --> 01:02:13,926
I came home and you were gone.
You were just gonna drop me like that?

977
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:15,969
I learned it
from you, Mike.

978
01:02:16,053 --> 01:02:19,306
You always told me
that this was the rule.

979
01:02:19,389 --> 01:02:22,309
Rule number one: Throw in your cards
the moment you know they can't win.

980
01:02:22,392 --> 01:02:25,687
- Fold the hand.
- Look, this is our thing
that we're talking about.

981
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:28,607
It's not some
losing hand of poker.

982
01:02:28,649 --> 01:02:32,820
I know exactly what
we're talking about, Mike.

983
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,826
So, that's the last
of it, then?

984
01:02:41,495 --> 01:02:43,455
Yeah.

985
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:57,845
I mean, I'd say good luck, but I know
it's not about luck in your game.

986
01:03:05,936 --> 01:03:08,480
Eric Seidel cannot win this hand,

987
01:03:08,522 --> 01:03:10,858
and yet
he doesn't know it.

988
01:03:10,899 --> 01:03:15,988
Chan is trying to sucker him in
by taking his time.

989
01:03:16,071 --> 01:03:19,658
Oh, look at that look
of the defending champ.

990
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:23,328
And now Fifth Street,
a six of diamonds. No help.

991
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,999
Johnny Chan has
a queen high straight.

992
01:03:27,082 --> 01:03:30,878
Will Eric Seidel
fall for the bait?

993
01:03:30,919 --> 01:03:34,506
Yes, he's going all in,
and Chan has him.

994
01:03:34,548 --> 01:03:36,842
Johnny Chan, the master...

995
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:43,223
- Yes, he's going all in,
and Chan has him.

996
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:49,938
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, Mike. It's Petra.
Can I come up?

997
01:03:50,022 --> 01:03:51,940
Yeah, I'll buzz you in.

998
01:03:56,361 --> 01:03:59,656
Well, that's the important thing
with the game of Hold 'Em.

999
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,076
You're never down and out
until your chips are all gone.

1000
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:06,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

1001
01:04:06,121 --> 01:04:08,248
- How you doing?
- Good.

1002
01:04:10,459 --> 01:04:15,881
- I haven't seen the place in a while.

1003
01:04:15,923 --> 01:04:17,883
Looks about the same.

1004
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:22,262
- You want some scotch or something?
- No, I'm fine.

1005
01:04:22,346 --> 01:04:26,934
- Oh, '88 World Series, huh?
- Yeah.

1006
01:04:27,017 --> 01:04:28,936
Johnny Chan.

1007
01:04:29,019 --> 01:04:32,648
Flops the nut straight and
has the discipline to wait him out.

1008
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:35,401
He knows Seidel's
gonna bluff at it.

1009
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:38,404
- And yet he doesn't know it.
- Johnny fucking Chan.

1010
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:42,408
Chan is trying to sucker him in
by taking his time.

1011
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:45,327
Look at the control.
Look at that fuck.

1012
01:04:45,411 --> 01:04:48,622
He knows his man well enough
to check it all the way...

1013
01:04:48,664 --> 01:04:51,166
and risk winning nothing
with those cards.

1014
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,168
He owns him.

1015
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:56,130
Will Eric Seidel fall for the bait?

1016
01:04:56,171 --> 01:04:59,633
Yes, he's going all in
and Chan has him.

1017
01:04:59,716 --> 01:05:03,929
- Johnny Chan, the master.
- Poor Seidel.
Kid doesn't know what hit him.

1018
01:05:03,971 --> 01:05:06,640
Yeah, I know
what that feels like.

1019
01:05:06,723 --> 01:05:09,977
It's like a locomotive
running through your stomach.

1020
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:14,481
You feel gut-shot. Fuck it.
You didn't come here to talk about this.

1021
01:05:14,565 --> 01:05:16,608
What's going on?

1022
01:05:18,694 --> 01:05:22,656
- Tomorrow's a week.
- A week of what?

1023
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:27,077
The first two thousand
you owe the Chesterfield.

1024
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:30,956
- Oh. Worm.
- Yes, it's kinda weird.

1025
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:34,710
He'd just won eight grand.
Why go on the line behind another two?

1026
01:05:34,793 --> 01:05:38,464
So, he took, what, about eight
off of Roman and Maurice?

1027
01:05:38,547 --> 01:05:42,217
Yeah, yeah, he comes in
after you leave,

1028
01:05:42,301 --> 01:05:44,595
sits for like
another 20 more minutes,

1029
01:05:44,678 --> 01:05:47,514
cashes out
for the full amount.

1030
01:05:47,556 --> 01:05:51,643
Maurice hasn't been back since. I think
he's been playing across the street.

1031
01:05:51,685 --> 01:05:55,314
But, uh, Worm's
been around plenty.

1032
01:05:55,397 --> 01:05:58,317
He's run you up
just under seven grand.

1033
01:06:00,736 --> 01:06:04,323
Well, do me a favor
and just put him on his own.

1034
01:06:04,364 --> 01:06:07,284
- Yeah?
- Yeah, cut him off.

1035
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:09,495
Um, I tell ya,
I got a thousand.

1036
01:06:09,536 --> 01:06:12,206
I got a thou.
And that's, you know...

1037
01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:14,583
I just started
coming back, so...

1038
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:19,880
- Thanks for making it easy, Mike.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1039
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,676
I'm, uh... I'm sorry to be back
over here for this reason.

1040
01:06:24,718 --> 01:06:28,639
- Don't worry about it.
- No, l... I like being here.

1041
01:06:28,722 --> 01:06:31,558
It's good
to see you, Mike.

1042
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,107
- I can stay.
- Listen, I tell ya, I'Il... I'Il, um...

1043
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,068
I'll come... I'll come...
I'll see you down at the club.

1044
01:06:41,151 --> 01:06:43,862
- I'll come by this week.
- Yeah.

1045
01:07:24,695 --> 01:07:27,239
I know you're in here.

1046
01:07:32,953 --> 01:07:34,872
Mike?

1047
01:07:34,955 --> 01:07:37,875
Hey. I thought you
were the janitor, man.

1048
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:40,919
It's a good thing Grama
doesn't know you as well as I do.

1049
01:07:41,003 --> 01:07:44,006
Come on. I'll play ya horse.
Fifty bucks a letter.

1050
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:48,302
Yeah? When I win, are you gonna pay
me back with my own fucking money?

1051
01:07:48,343 --> 01:07:52,097
Oh, oh, easy. Relax. Don't wing it.
Just... Just step and throw.

1052
01:07:57,478 --> 01:07:59,646
You need to work
on your accuracy.

1053
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:03,650
Will you stop fucking around
for five goddamn minutes
for once in your fucking life!

1054
01:08:03,692 --> 01:08:06,653
Whoa, Jesus. What happened?
My old man just walked in the door.

1055
01:08:06,695 --> 01:08:09,823
I should fucking beat the shit
out of you the way he used to.

1056
01:08:12,493 --> 01:08:15,120
You remember when we found
this place, man?

1057
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:19,666
Yeah, I remember
when we found this place.

1058
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,545
You were hiding from Tommy Manzy
'cause you thought he was gonna
fucking pound you into oblivion.

1059
01:08:23,629 --> 01:08:26,548
Yeah, now, see?
What did I ever do to that guy?

1060
01:08:26,632 --> 01:08:29,843
- You fucked his mother.

1061
01:08:29,927 --> 01:08:33,680
Yeah, but she was a good-Iooking
older woman. You gotta give me that.

1062
01:08:33,722 --> 01:08:37,684
You spent a year of your life hiding in
this fucking gym from that sick fuck...

1063
01:08:37,768 --> 01:08:41,063
until he pissed off
the wrong guy and someone dropped
a garbage can on his head.

1064
01:08:41,146 --> 01:08:44,024
What do you want me to say? Those
were wild times. You were there too.

1065
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:46,193
Nothing's changed.
Nothing has changed.

1066
01:08:46,276 --> 01:08:49,029
You were hiding from your troubles then.
You're hiding from your troubles now.

1067
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:51,657
I like to hide, and that's
part of the fun for me, you know?

1068
01:08:51,698 --> 01:08:53,659
I don't like
running solo.

1069
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,994
It's like I used to have a running
partner, you know what I'm saying?

1070
01:08:56,036 --> 01:08:58,497
If we fucked up back then
and got caught,

1071
01:08:58,539 --> 01:09:02,626
the worst thing that was going to happen
was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.

1072
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:06,880
But, man, you're fixing to go down hard,
and it almost seems like you want to.

1073
01:09:06,964 --> 01:09:09,800
Stop worrying so much about me, okay?
I'm turning things around.

1074
01:09:09,883 --> 01:09:12,428
I'm not gonna let anybody
drop a garbage can on my head.

1075
01:09:12,511 --> 01:09:15,722
No, no, you're gonna get out of the way.
It's gonna land on me.

1076
01:09:15,764 --> 01:09:17,724
I'll see ya.

1077
01:09:21,103 --> 01:09:25,441
Come on, Mike. Hey.
Come on, come on, come on.

1078
01:09:27,025 --> 01:09:29,486
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry about the money.

1079
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,488
I should've told you.

1080
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:35,743
It's just... What do you want me to say?
It's fucking embarrassing.

1081
01:09:35,826 --> 01:09:38,328
l, like, just get out,
I'm in a big fucking hole.

1082
01:09:38,412 --> 01:09:41,373
I need something to get goin'.
I gotta get started.

1083
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:43,417
And?

1084
01:09:43,459 --> 01:09:46,712
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
There's been some reversals.

1085
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:51,216
- Some reversals.
How much money do you have?
- Nine hundred.

1086
01:09:51,258 --> 01:09:55,429
I mean, I caught a frozen wave of cards
like you fucking read about.

1087
01:09:55,512 --> 01:09:59,224
I think I'm getting you outta hock,
I find out I'm seven grand in.

1088
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:02,269
I know, man. I was really...
I was really up big.

1089
01:10:02,311 --> 01:10:04,271
I was cruising along.

1090
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:07,232
I tried to beat that blackjack game
at the Horseshoe Club in Brooklyn.

1091
01:10:07,274 --> 01:10:11,111
- That place is a mitt joint.
- I know. It was,
like, ouch. I'm so stupid.

1092
01:10:11,153 --> 01:10:14,281
I got so good with this,
I thought I could neutralize 'em.

1093
01:10:14,364 --> 01:10:16,492
You're really jamming me up
here, man. Seven grand.

1094
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:21,246
- I know.
- That's it. I can't go any deeper
than that. You're off the tip.

1095
01:10:21,288 --> 01:10:23,665
- I understand. That's okay.
- And you gotta talk with Grama.

1096
01:10:23,749 --> 01:10:26,752
- You gotta square things
away with Grama.
- No way, Mike.

1097
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:29,088
I'm not talking
to that fucking Judas.

1098
01:10:29,129 --> 01:10:31,090
You think
there's any other way?

1099
01:10:34,635 --> 01:10:37,763
I know all
the reasons I shouldn't be here,

1100
01:10:37,846 --> 01:10:40,557
but sometimes
reasons don't matter.

1101
01:10:40,641 --> 01:10:43,602
You see, no one's
ever stood up for Worm.

1102
01:10:43,685 --> 01:10:46,980
The guy's been kicked around
his whole life, from his father on down.

1103
01:10:49,066 --> 01:10:52,403
Maybe he's not the same guy
he was when he went away,

1104
01:10:52,486 --> 01:10:55,447
but I can't give up on him
that easy.

1105
01:10:55,489 --> 01:10:57,658
I'm all he's got.

1106
01:10:57,741 --> 01:10:59,993
Oh, what the hell.

1107
01:11:02,955 --> 01:11:05,582
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

1108
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:08,544
You cops?
You look like cops.

1109
01:11:08,627 --> 01:11:12,005
- We're not cops.
- You wanna twirl then?

1110
01:11:12,047 --> 01:11:15,008
No, no, we're just here
to see Grama.

1111
01:11:19,138 --> 01:11:21,056
Jesus.

1112
01:11:23,142 --> 01:11:26,687
- You sure about this?
I got a bad feeling.
- That's all right. Just...

1113
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:30,065
Just let me do
the talking, all right?

1114
01:11:34,486 --> 01:11:36,488
Hey, Grama.

1115
01:11:36,572 --> 01:11:39,825
- Long time.
- Mike.

1116
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:43,162
Hey, Worm. It's good you came.
That's real smart thinking.

1117
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:46,915
So, did you bring him along
to help carry all my money?

1118
01:11:46,999 --> 01:11:48,917
Uh, there's no money today.

1119
01:11:49,001 --> 01:11:51,920
No money?
There's gotta be some money.

1120
01:11:52,004 --> 01:11:54,173
Come on. Get outta here.

1121
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:58,552
He's not kidding.
I got nothing.

1122
01:11:58,635 --> 01:12:02,514
You owe 25. I'll take
the rest in five days.

1123
01:12:02,556 --> 01:12:05,684
- Five grand in a week,
and you keep the juice going...
- Shh. Quiet.

1124
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:09,271
- You gotta catch 'em in the act.

1125
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:15,944
- Get in your hole, you bitch!

1126
01:12:16,028 --> 01:12:18,280
- Christ.
- Fucking dog.

1127
01:12:18,363 --> 01:12:22,618
You can't let 'em get away with it
or else they think they run the place.

1128
01:12:22,701 --> 01:12:25,913
- So, where were we?
- Five grand.

1129
01:12:25,954 --> 01:12:30,542
In a week. Grama, we want what
you want. We wanna square this thing.

1130
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:34,421
But three days... three days
is impossible. All right?

1131
01:12:34,463 --> 01:12:37,758
No one's saying you're not the man. Just
think of this as a business decision.

1132
01:12:37,841 --> 01:12:40,844
Look, he just got out.
Let's put him on a plan.

1133
01:12:40,928 --> 01:12:43,722
No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't The Money Store.

1134
01:12:43,764 --> 01:12:46,391
We're not negotiating here.
I tell you how it works.

1135
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:47,893
Well, then, I'm asking.

1136
01:12:49,937 --> 01:12:54,066
So, you're looking for a
little grace, Lester, some charity?

1137
01:12:54,149 --> 01:12:57,778
You know what, Grama?
I need your fucking charity
like I need your cock in my ass.

1138
01:12:57,861 --> 01:13:01,073
- Shut the fuck up!
- It's too late for him to shut up.

1139
01:13:01,115 --> 01:13:03,742
- Hey, listen! He's good for it.
- He's good for it, Mike?

1140
01:13:03,784 --> 01:13:06,245
If you think he's good for it,
it's on you too.

1141
01:13:06,286 --> 01:13:08,247
Then it's on me too.

1142
01:13:08,288 --> 01:13:11,750
- Fifteen large, five days,
or I start breaking things.
- I hear ya.

1143
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:14,795
Get the fuck outta here.

1144
01:13:14,878 --> 01:13:16,839
Piece of shit.

1145
01:13:16,922 --> 01:13:19,341
Now, what the hell
are you doing?

1146
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:21,844
I'm not gonna get down on my knees
for that jerk-off.

1147
01:13:21,927 --> 01:13:24,638
All I said is just keep
your mouth shut for five seconds.

1148
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:27,474
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Goddamn it.

1149
01:13:27,558 --> 01:13:30,811
That's it.
I'm really sunk now.

1150
01:13:30,894 --> 01:13:35,232
No, 15 grand in five days.
I can do that. I've gone
on rushes like that before.

1151
01:13:35,315 --> 01:13:39,486
Ah, under optimum conditions
with a bankroll, maybe.

1152
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:42,489
- But what have you got on you?
- Got, like, 350.

1153
01:13:42,573 --> 01:13:45,951
Ah, that's 1,200 between us.
We might as well play the fucking Lotto.

1154
01:13:45,993 --> 01:13:49,621
No, man, no. Listen. Find the games,
scout 'em out, I sit, I mop 'em up.

1155
01:13:49,663 --> 01:13:52,040
You know, we might have
a shot at this...

1156
01:13:52,124 --> 01:13:54,752
if we sat together
and just did our thing.

1157
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:57,629
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm gonna do this straight up.

1158
01:13:57,671 --> 01:13:59,548
- Oh, fuck, man.
- I mean it.

1159
01:13:59,631 --> 01:14:02,760
- Well, where do you wanna start?
- There's a 30-60 at the Chesterfield.

1160
01:14:02,843 --> 01:14:06,138
Come on, listen... there's the 4:00 a.m.
in Woodside. There's the Greeks.

1161
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,682
All right, there's
a union game in Jersey.

1162
01:14:08,766 --> 01:14:11,685
- I know a guy
whose cousin can get us in.
- All right.

1163
01:14:11,769 --> 01:14:14,188
- There's four.
- There's a cigar shop in Brooklyn.

1164
01:14:14,229 --> 01:14:18,400
- It's like an easy clean.
- There's a golf pro game
in Riverdale. That's six.

1165
01:14:18,484 --> 01:14:20,569
- You sure you're up for this?
- I'm fucking up for this.

1166
01:14:20,652 --> 01:14:22,571
An 80.

1167
01:14:29,661 --> 01:14:32,164
I bet the full amount.

1168
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:35,501
The full amount, huh?
Well, let me look at you here.

1169
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,839
Nope. You didn't do it this time.
I'm gonna raise you.

1170
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:54,937
- I don't know.
- The bet's 50.

1171
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,648
I kinda like this robusto.

1172
01:14:57,731 --> 01:14:59,858
A nice, nutty finish.

1173
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:05,364
I love the Cameroon wrapper
on this baby. Nice and oily.

1174
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:09,868
I'll call.
What do you got?

1175
01:15:09,952 --> 01:15:11,912
I have what's
known as the wheel.

1176
01:15:11,995 --> 01:15:16,250
It's got earthy tones, a smooth draw,
enough kick to win me the Hi and the Lo.

1177
01:15:17,751 --> 01:15:19,753
Call.

1178
01:15:19,795 --> 01:15:24,550
- Trip aces.
- L... I only got a pair.

1179
01:15:24,591 --> 01:15:27,428
- Jacks.
- What did you think he had?

1180
01:15:27,511 --> 01:15:30,097
Does he look like a man
beaten by jacks?

1181
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:33,642
Jacks are a monster compared
to the crap you play, Taki.

1182
01:15:33,725 --> 01:15:37,646
- Ah, fuck you. Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

1183
01:15:37,729 --> 01:15:40,816
It's only money. I bet.

1184
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:43,569
Then let's get some in there.

1185
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:47,239
- Make it five.
- You're raising me 300, kid?

1186
01:15:48,782 --> 01:15:50,743
I call your 300.

1187
01:15:50,784 --> 01:15:54,413
- How much is in there, Weitz?
- About 1,500. 1,500.

1188
01:15:54,455 --> 01:15:57,666
Here's a thousand. There's 500.

1189
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,626
I bet you
the pot limit, kiddo.

1190
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:01,962
Are you sure on that, Goldie?

1191
01:16:02,004 --> 01:16:05,591
You might want to leave
a little something for
your daughter's riding lessons.

1192
01:16:05,632 --> 01:16:08,260
There's a lot more
where that came from, Weitz.

1193
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:13,640
Take it down.

1194
01:16:13,724 --> 01:16:16,268
I got shit.
I bluffed the big ringer.

1195
01:16:16,351 --> 01:16:18,812
- Let's go. Let's go.

1196
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:22,649
Get up. Get off your ass.
We're done. Come on.

1197
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:25,611
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere...
Oh, by the way, anybody.

1198
01:16:25,652 --> 01:16:28,363
Buy some real jewelry,
you fucking cheap bastard.

1199
01:16:28,447 --> 01:16:29,948
Unbelievable.

1200
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:32,826
- What were you doing in there?
- I didn't have it.

1201
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:34,828
You didn't have it?

1202
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:37,873
Since when you have to have it to
take a pot off a hump like that?

1203
01:16:37,956 --> 01:16:40,876
- A grade schooler would've
played back at that guy.
- I was waiting the guy out.

1204
01:16:40,959 --> 01:16:43,879
Eventually, he was going to bluff
at the wrong pot. I was gonna take him.

1205
01:16:43,962 --> 01:16:47,925
We don't have time.
That guy was papier-mache.
You gotta make strong moves.

1206
01:16:48,008 --> 01:16:51,804
The move was folding. I can't lose
what I don't put in the middle.

1207
01:16:51,845 --> 01:16:55,766
Oh, Jesus, you know what?
Fuck all that 'cause we needed that pot.

1208
01:16:55,849 --> 01:16:58,185
Well, what
are we up to?

1209
01:17:01,146 --> 01:17:03,065
That's like seven.
Seven.

1210
01:17:03,148 --> 01:17:06,110
With that pot you just dumped
on that fucking V-neck sweater,

1211
01:17:06,193 --> 01:17:08,112
we would've had ten.

1212
01:17:08,195 --> 01:17:11,365
Look at you. One 64-hour session,
and you need a nap.

1213
01:17:11,448 --> 01:17:13,867
- No time for a fucking nap.
- No, we don't. That's all right.

1214
01:17:13,951 --> 01:17:16,703
Come on.
I know what you need.

1215
01:17:16,787 --> 01:17:19,373
I know... I got just the place
for you. Yeah, yeah.

1216
01:17:28,674 --> 01:17:32,386
Feel like I'm gonna get whacked
sitting here like this.

1217
01:17:34,471 --> 01:17:40,018
We got 7,300, Mike.
We gotta double that in two days.

1218
01:17:40,102 --> 01:17:44,565
Well, we're gonna get close. I'm sure
if we come up a little short, Grama...

1219
01:17:44,606 --> 01:17:47,067
We come up
even a little short,

1220
01:17:47,109 --> 01:17:50,070
Grama will shoot us and bury us
in a hole somewhere.

1221
01:17:51,613 --> 01:17:54,241
Now, I know this game
up in Binghamton.

1222
01:17:54,324 --> 01:17:56,535
- In Binghamton?
- Yeah, yeah.

1223
01:17:56,577 --> 01:18:01,665
It's like 16 or 17 guys.
Two full tables. All municipal workers.

1224
01:18:01,749 --> 01:18:05,711
They come play right after
they get their paychecks. It's very fat.

1225
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:09,423
Are you sure? Binghamton's
five hours each way.

1226
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:14,094
Well, look, I figure there's
15 or 20 grand in that room, okay?

1227
01:18:14,178 --> 01:18:17,806
If we get even half of that,
we're home.

1228
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:19,808
Lead me to it.

1229
01:18:30,277 --> 01:18:35,407
- Municipal workers, huh?
- What? These guys work for the city.

1230
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:37,826
They work for the state,
you idiot.

1231
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:41,080
Oh, this is
just stupid.

1232
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:44,083
Look, we're here, okay?

1233
01:18:44,124 --> 01:18:48,337
- You got any better ideas?
- How the hell am I supposed
to even get in this game?

1234
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:52,508
No, it's easy.
The whole time I was in the joint,
I was just dumping money to guards.

1235
01:18:52,591 --> 01:18:57,096
This one guy, Pete Frye, I probably lost
like ten grand over 18 months.

1236
01:18:57,137 --> 01:18:59,640
I mean, he thinks
I'm a total fish.

1237
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:02,768
He told me anytime I wanted a game
when I got out, just look up his nephew.

1238
01:19:02,851 --> 01:19:06,480
You just go in there,
you ask for Sean Frye, you're in.

1239
01:19:06,563 --> 01:19:09,817
You're gonna clean this game up.
These guys are total suckers.

1240
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:12,319
All right. Give me,
like, eight hours.

1241
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:15,948
- Come back at 7:00, 7:30.
- What am I gonna do for eight hours?

1242
01:19:16,031 --> 01:19:20,035
- Why don't I come in?
I'll sit for a little while.
- No.

1243
01:19:20,119 --> 01:19:24,331
- No, not a chance.
- I'll sit at the other table
and play straight.

1244
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:28,127
You wanna play straight? You go
in there, I'll be back in eight hours.

1245
01:19:30,212 --> 01:19:32,172
Aw, Jesus.

1246
01:19:32,214 --> 01:19:35,676
All right, all right. I'll go find
a fucking bowling alley.

1247
01:19:35,717 --> 01:19:37,344
I don't know.

1248
01:19:41,682 --> 01:19:43,642
Excuse me.

1249
01:19:43,684 --> 01:19:47,771
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Sean Frye.

1250
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:53,110
Yeah, right over there
in that cap.

1251
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:55,112
Thanks.

1252
01:20:00,284 --> 01:20:02,202
Let's go.

1253
01:20:02,286 --> 01:20:04,329
- Sean Frye?
- That's right.

1254
01:20:04,413 --> 01:20:08,208
Yeah, your Uncle Pete told me
to come by if I ever was around here.

1255
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,461
You one
of his students?

1256
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:16,175
Oh, no, no, no, no.
l... I wasn't inside.

1257
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:19,553
- You know him from hunting then, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, actually.

1258
01:20:19,595 --> 01:20:23,265
I met him over at, uh... He took me
for like a grand over at the lodge.

1259
01:20:23,348 --> 01:20:27,019
Well, that's the buy-in here.
We play 20-40 Stud.

1260
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,521
- Grab a seat.
- Great.

1261
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:41,450
- How you doing? I'm Mike.
- How you doing? Vitter.

1262
01:20:41,533 --> 01:20:44,203
- Osborne.
- Hi.
- This is Whitley.

1263
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:46,205
Bet 40.

1264
01:20:46,246 --> 01:20:48,624
- Back at ya.

1265
01:20:48,707 --> 01:20:52,169
- All right.
- You and me, Mike.

1266
01:20:53,754 --> 01:20:55,672
Another 40.

1267
01:20:55,756 --> 01:20:58,842
All right,
40 it is.

1268
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:02,554
- Flush.
- Mm.

1269
01:21:02,596 --> 01:21:06,391
Generally,
the rule is, the nicer the guy,
the poorer the card player.

1270
01:21:06,433 --> 01:21:09,895
And these guys, despite being cops,
are real sweethearts.

1271
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:14,066
I'm right on schedule,
up 4,200.

1272
01:21:14,108 --> 01:21:18,070
- The morning can't get here soon enough.

1273
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:21,073
Holy shit! That's a hell of an elk.

1274
01:21:21,115 --> 01:21:23,784
My grandfather got that one.
Ain't that a beauty?

1275
01:21:23,867 --> 01:21:25,911
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey, Bear!

1276
01:21:25,994 --> 01:21:29,248
Met this guy down at the bowling alley.
Says he likes to play cards.

1277
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:32,626
Well, you've come to the right place.

1278
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:35,254
This is Whitley. Osborne.
This guy's name is Mike.

1279
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:37,923
- Mike? How are ya? Les Murphy.
- This is Vitter.

1280
01:21:37,965 --> 01:21:40,300
- So, what are you guys playing?
- 20-40 Stud.

1281
01:21:40,384 --> 01:21:42,302
Okay.
Deal me in.

1282
01:21:42,386 --> 01:21:44,763
All right,
your money's good here.

1283
01:21:44,805 --> 01:21:47,850
Give him some chips,
start playing some cards.

1284
01:21:52,438 --> 01:21:54,648
Everybody ante.

1285
01:21:59,278 --> 01:22:01,864
Let's play some cards.

1286
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:16,670
- Ace high bets.
- Well, I like what I have.

1287
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:18,797
The bet is 20.

1288
01:22:18,881 --> 01:22:21,216
I know that look.
I'm gonna fold.

1289
01:22:22,801 --> 01:22:24,720
Fold too.

1290
01:22:24,803 --> 01:22:26,722
I'll take it.

1291
01:22:28,807 --> 01:22:31,810
- Yeah, everybody ready? Fourth Street.
- Yes, sir.

1292
01:22:38,358 --> 01:22:40,319
Raise you.

1293
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:44,364
- I'm in.
- Wow. Wow. A lot of action.

1294
01:22:44,448 --> 01:22:48,660
A lot of action.

1295
01:22:51,955 --> 01:22:55,375
- I got the flush.
- Show me. What you got in here?

1296
01:22:58,128 --> 01:23:01,423
- Jesus. Who wants more?
- I'm in.

1297
01:23:01,507 --> 01:23:03,717
- I'm in.
- Come on, come on.

1298
01:23:03,801 --> 01:23:06,261
I'm staging
a late-night comeback here.

1299
01:23:07,888 --> 01:23:10,224
Late-night rally.

1300
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:14,394
Okay? Just to...
Just to warn you.

1301
01:23:15,979 --> 01:23:17,773
Ace high bets.

1302
01:23:20,776 --> 01:23:22,569
Uh, ace checks.

1303
01:23:22,653 --> 01:23:26,573
- Check.
- Check on an ace. All right. I'll check.

1304
01:23:26,657 --> 01:23:28,575
- Check.
- Check.

1305
01:23:28,659 --> 01:23:31,203
All right, free card.
Here we go.

1306
01:23:31,245 --> 01:23:33,872
- Hold on there a fucking second.
- Easy. What are you doing?

1307
01:23:33,914 --> 01:23:37,126
- Give me the deck.
- Relax, man. Don't get so agitated.

1308
01:23:37,209 --> 01:23:40,587
- Looks like we got a road gang here.
- A what?

1309
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:44,633
- What are you... What?
- What the hell's going
on over here, Stu?

1310
01:23:44,716 --> 01:23:46,802
This son of a bitch
is base dealing.

1311
01:23:46,885 --> 01:23:49,555
- Caught a hanger, Sarge.
- What? A hanger?

1312
01:23:49,638 --> 01:23:52,099
I don't even know
what you're saying.

1313
01:23:52,141 --> 01:23:56,437
- He's saying you're dealing
off the bottom of the deck.
- Oh, God. Come on, guys.

1314
01:23:56,478 --> 01:23:58,856
- What did he give him?
- To me?

1315
01:23:58,939 --> 01:24:03,402
- Seven of hearts.
- You boys professionals? You working?

1316
01:24:03,444 --> 01:24:05,654
I was winning
before this guy got here.

1317
01:24:05,738 --> 01:24:08,323
Okay, okay. Let's let the cards
do the talking.

1318
01:24:08,407 --> 01:24:11,493
If the seven didn't help you,
we'll listen to what you have to say.

1319
01:24:11,577 --> 01:24:14,288
Ozzy, turn the cards.

1320
01:24:14,371 --> 01:24:16,832
- Come on! It's three of a kind!

1321
01:24:16,915 --> 01:24:19,835
- Shut up!
- I'm just sayin', it's three of a kind.

1322
01:24:19,918 --> 01:24:22,254
One last thing, Stu.

1323
01:24:23,547 --> 01:24:25,466
- Scumbag!

1324
01:24:25,549 --> 01:24:27,468
Hey, all right,
take it easy.

1325
01:24:27,551 --> 01:24:29,970
Aren't you supposed
to read us our rights?

1326
01:24:30,012 --> 01:24:31,764
Here's your fuckin' rights!

1327
01:24:35,684 --> 01:24:37,644
Fuck you!

1328
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:55,496
Get the fuck outta here,
you cocksuckers! Shit!

1329
01:24:57,206 --> 01:24:59,374
Aw, Jesus!

1330
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:03,670
Worm.

1331
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:08,050
Worm?

1332
01:25:10,135 --> 01:25:12,554
Hey, Les.

1333
01:25:12,638 --> 01:25:14,556
Hey.

1334
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:17,184
Hey, you all right?

1335
01:25:17,267 --> 01:25:19,186
Mike?

1336
01:25:19,269 --> 01:25:21,188
Yeah.

1337
01:25:22,773 --> 01:25:25,192
You should've played
those kings, Mike.

1338
01:25:25,275 --> 01:25:28,112
- Aw, you're an asshole.

1339
01:25:28,195 --> 01:25:32,074
I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

1340
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:35,744
They took
every fucking nickel.

1341
01:25:35,828 --> 01:25:39,415
I think I got 300
in my boot somewhere.

1342
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,128
Oh, look at you.
Fuck!

1343
01:25:44,211 --> 01:25:47,047
Fuck, I cannot believe
I caught a hanger.

1344
01:25:47,131 --> 01:25:51,927
- Aw, it's never happened,
I swear to God.
- Where's the car?

1345
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:55,180
- God, I think I cracked a rib.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

1346
01:25:55,264 --> 01:25:58,434
- I was trying to give us an edge.
- I had 'em.

1347
01:25:58,517 --> 01:26:00,978
Hey, I'm sorry
we got banged up, all right?

1348
01:26:01,061 --> 01:26:03,480
I took a shot and I missed.
That happens.

1349
01:26:03,564 --> 01:26:07,192
- Fucking happens
all the time around you.
- What, it doesn't happen to you?

1350
01:26:07,276 --> 01:26:10,487
You're the guy who flushed his whole
fucking bankroll on one hand, Mike.

1351
01:26:10,571 --> 01:26:14,491
- Oh, hey, fuck you, man.
That was different.
- Why? Explain that to me.

1352
01:26:14,575 --> 01:26:17,661
Why different, huh?
What makes you so fucking special?

1353
01:26:17,745 --> 01:26:20,038
How come all your moves
are so smart and noble...

1354
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,458
and I'm always
the idiot piece of shit?

1355
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:25,252
You act like you're the only one
with any fucking ambition.

1356
01:26:25,335 --> 01:26:28,881
What's your ambition, man? Tell me.
I don't know. What is it?

1357
01:26:28,964 --> 01:26:32,718
- I don't even know.
I don't think like that.
- No, you don't think.

1358
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,720
No, I don't think
like you!

1359
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:37,723
You always think you can beat the game
straight up. That's not me.

1360
01:26:37,765 --> 01:26:40,768
- I told you, I'm always gonna
look for that edge. Always.
- What's the edge now?

1361
01:26:40,809 --> 01:26:43,270
We owe 15 grand in a day.
What do we do?

1362
01:26:43,312 --> 01:26:46,148
It's easy. We get
the fuck outta Dodge, all right?

1363
01:26:46,231 --> 01:26:49,068
We just steer clear
of the city for a while.

1364
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:52,446
We'll hit the road. We'll be up again
in no time. This'll all blow over.

1365
01:26:52,529 --> 01:26:55,240
- We'll have a ball.
- Not a fucking chance
I'm gonna live like that.

1366
01:26:55,282 --> 01:27:00,079
- You talk to Grama.
You get him to stake me.
- It's not gonna work, okay?

1367
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,748
We're not dealing with Grama.

1368
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:07,419
You said
Grama's on his own.

1369
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:11,215
- You told me Grama's on his own.
- KGB bankrolled him.

1370
01:27:12,925 --> 01:27:17,471
- So you've just fucked us
right in the ass.
- Yeah, all the way, okay?

1371
01:27:17,554 --> 01:27:21,600
So you see what I'm saying?
No fooling around. It's highway time.

1372
01:27:21,642 --> 01:27:25,062
Are you with me or not?

1373
01:27:25,145 --> 01:27:27,439
No, I'm not this time.

1374
01:27:34,613 --> 01:27:38,617
- Give me the keys.
- You're really gonna go back there?

1375
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:41,995
Yeah.

1376
01:27:43,247 --> 01:27:46,208
I'll see you
when I see you.

1377
01:27:48,252 --> 01:27:52,131
Hey. At least you're
rounding again, right?

1378
01:27:52,172 --> 01:27:55,551
You're gonna thank me
for that someday.

1379
01:28:06,061 --> 01:28:10,107
Fold or hang tough.
Call or raise the bet.

1380
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:13,277
These are decisions
you make at the table.

1381
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,864
Sometimes the odds are stacked so clear,
there's only one way to play it.

1382
01:28:16,947 --> 01:28:20,993
Other times, like holding a small pair
against two over cards,

1383
01:28:21,076 --> 01:28:23,704
it's six to five,
or even money, either way.

1384
01:28:23,787 --> 01:28:27,332
Then it's all about feel,
what's in your guts.

1385
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:30,377
Well, look at you.

1386
01:28:30,461 --> 01:28:32,755
Look at me.

1387
01:28:32,838 --> 01:28:34,840
Come in.

1388
01:28:34,923 --> 01:28:36,884
No.

1389
01:28:36,925 --> 01:28:41,388
- Where's your friend?
- Uh, he's gone.

1390
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:45,392
- He's gone.
- So you brought my money?

1391
01:28:46,977 --> 01:28:51,023
- I'm a little short.
- How short?

1392
01:28:51,106 --> 01:28:52,900
The whole way.

1393
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:56,028
There must be
some kind of story.

1394
01:28:57,738 --> 01:28:59,782
Well...

1395
01:28:59,865 --> 01:29:03,368
as you can see,
I can't pay you.

1396
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:06,205
I see you're
banged up pretty good.

1397
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:13,712
You never should've vouched
for that scumbag.

1398
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,759
Maybe not.

1399
01:29:20,344 --> 01:29:23,764
- You're leaving me no outs here.
- Why?

1400
01:29:23,806 --> 01:29:27,392
I can't trust you two
aren't playing me.

1401
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:29,937
I'm not the one
working with a partner here.

1402
01:29:32,022 --> 01:29:36,276
You wanna take it up with KGB,
you go right ahead.

1403
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:41,907
Otherwise, you got one day,
or this'll feel like a Swedish massage.

1404
01:29:59,258 --> 01:30:01,343
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

1405
01:30:11,895 --> 01:30:15,649
You look like Duane Bobick
after one round with Norton.

1406
01:30:15,732 --> 01:30:20,654
- What the fuck happened to you?
- Ah, Worm.

1407
01:30:21,739 --> 01:30:23,949
When are you
gonna listen?

1408
01:30:24,032 --> 01:30:26,493
I'm listening.

1409
01:30:26,577 --> 01:30:30,372
What do you need?
500? A grand?

1410
01:30:30,456 --> 01:30:33,041
- Huh?
- I need... I need 15,000.

1411
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:35,669
- Fifteen?
- Yep.

1412
01:30:35,753 --> 01:30:38,839
I need a blow job
from Christy Turlington.

1413
01:30:38,922 --> 01:30:42,509
- Get the fuck outta here. $15,000?
- Seriously, Joey.

1414
01:30:42,593 --> 01:30:46,513
What can you do for me?
Five hundred dollars is not
even gonna get me started.

1415
01:30:46,597 --> 01:30:51,393
Goddamn it, Mike, if 500 won't
help, what's two grand gonna do?

1416
01:30:52,978 --> 01:30:55,522
What kind of trouble
you in?

1417
01:30:55,606 --> 01:30:58,650
I'm in the worst kind,
with the worst guy.

1418
01:30:58,734 --> 01:31:00,819
- KGB?
- Yep.

1419
01:31:02,905 --> 01:31:04,865
Come here.

1420
01:31:06,408 --> 01:31:08,660
Didn't I tell you...

1421
01:31:08,744 --> 01:31:11,663
to never let that guy
get a hold of you?

1422
01:31:11,705 --> 01:31:15,084
- You told me a lot of things.
- Yeah, yeah. And you don't listen.

1423
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:18,087
I tell you to play within your means,
you risk your whole bankroll.

1424
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:20,672
I tell you not to
overextend yourself, to rebuild,

1425
01:31:20,714 --> 01:31:23,133
you go into hock for more.

1426
01:31:23,217 --> 01:31:25,761
I was giving you
a living, Mike,

1427
01:31:25,844 --> 01:31:29,264
showing you the playbook
I put together off my own beats.

1428
01:31:29,348 --> 01:31:31,266
That wasn't enough
for you...

1429
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:35,229
This is one time I don't need
you to tell me how I fucked up.

1430
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:37,231
I know I fucked up.

1431
01:31:37,272 --> 01:31:40,234
What I need from you
is money.

1432
01:31:40,317 --> 01:31:43,237
- I need whatever money you can give me.
- See, that's the thing.

1433
01:31:43,278 --> 01:31:45,864
This time
there is no money.

1434
01:31:45,948 --> 01:31:49,451
I give you two grand,
what's that buy you? A day?

1435
01:31:49,535 --> 01:31:51,703
No, I give it to you,
I'm wasting it.

1436
01:31:51,787 --> 01:31:54,540
- That's fucking great.
- You did it to yourself.

1437
01:31:54,623 --> 01:31:57,584
You had to put it all on the line
for some Vegas pipe dream.

1438
01:31:57,626 --> 01:31:59,670
Yeah, I took a risk.
I took a risk.

1439
01:31:59,753 --> 01:32:02,214
You see all the angles.
You never have the stones to play one.

1440
01:32:02,297 --> 01:32:06,093
"Stones"?
You little punk.

1441
01:32:06,176 --> 01:32:09,012
I'm not playing for the thrill
of fucking victory here.

1442
01:32:09,096 --> 01:32:14,351
I owe rent, alimony, child support.
I play for money.

1443
01:32:14,435 --> 01:32:16,353
My kids eat.

1444
01:32:16,437 --> 01:32:18,897
I got stones enough
not to chase cards, action...

1445
01:32:18,939 --> 01:32:22,776
or fucking pipe dreams
of winning the World Series on ESPN.

1446
01:32:22,818 --> 01:32:25,446
You want me to, uh,
call some people,

1447
01:32:25,529 --> 01:32:27,698
try and buy you
some time, I will.

1448
01:32:27,781 --> 01:32:30,242
Place to stay, or the truck.
No problem.

1449
01:32:30,325 --> 01:32:34,705
But about the money,
I gotta do this. I gotta say no.

1450
01:32:34,788 --> 01:32:38,375
That's fine.
I understand.

1451
01:32:41,587 --> 01:32:44,173
- Hey, listen.
- What?

1452
01:32:44,256 --> 01:32:46,842
I put it all on the line.
That's true.

1453
01:32:46,925 --> 01:32:50,596
And you know what?
It wasn't a bad beat.

1454
01:32:50,637 --> 01:32:52,639
I wasn't unlucky.

1455
01:32:52,723 --> 01:32:55,559
I got outplayed.
I got outplayed that time.

1456
01:32:57,144 --> 01:33:00,147
But I know I'm good enough
to sit at that table.

1457
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:02,691
It's not... It's not
a fucking pipe dream.

1458
01:33:02,775 --> 01:33:05,235
I don't doubt your talent.

1459
01:33:05,319 --> 01:33:08,322
I never...
I never told anybody this.

1460
01:33:08,405 --> 01:33:12,493
About eight, nine months ago,
I'm at the Taj, it's late,

1461
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,620
and I see Johnny Chan
walk in.

1462
01:33:14,661 --> 01:33:16,622
And he goes,
he sits 300-600.

1463
01:33:16,663 --> 01:33:19,500
And the whole place stops
when Johnny Chan walks in.

1464
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:21,668
Everybody puts
an eye on him.

1465
01:33:21,752 --> 01:33:24,171
After a little while,
there wasn't a crap game going...

1466
01:33:24,254 --> 01:33:26,673
'cause all the high rollers
are over there watching him.

1467
01:33:26,757 --> 01:33:29,593
Some are playing with him, giving
away their money to this guy to say...

1468
01:33:29,676 --> 01:33:31,595
"Oh, I played
with the World Champion."

1469
01:33:31,678 --> 01:33:34,598
And you know what I did?
I sat down.

1470
01:33:34,681 --> 01:33:38,352
Nah, you need 50, 60 grand
to play right in that game.

1471
01:33:38,435 --> 01:33:40,938
Well, I had six,
but I had to know.

1472
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:42,940
What happened?

1473
01:33:43,023 --> 01:33:46,276
Played tight for an hour. I folded
mostly, and then I made a score.

1474
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,696
- Wired aces or kings?
- Rags.

1475
01:33:51,031 --> 01:33:54,493
I had nothing.
But he raised.

1476
01:33:54,576 --> 01:33:57,162
And I just decided, you know,
I don't care about the money.

1477
01:33:57,246 --> 01:33:59,540
I'm just gonna
outplay the guy.

1478
01:33:59,581 --> 01:34:02,251
I'm just gonna outplay
this guy this hand.

1479
01:34:02,334 --> 01:34:05,003
- I re-raised.
- Re-raise.

1480
01:34:05,087 --> 01:34:07,840
- You played right back at him, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

1481
01:34:07,923 --> 01:34:10,426
And he just comes right
back over the top of me,

1482
01:34:10,509 --> 01:34:13,011
trying to bully me like
I'm some fucking tourist.

1483
01:34:13,095 --> 01:34:15,055
I hesitate for two seconds.
I re-raised.

1484
01:34:15,097 --> 01:34:18,058
And he makes a move toward his checks,
and he looks at me.

1485
01:34:18,142 --> 01:34:21,562
And he looks at his cards,
and he looks at me again.

1486
01:34:21,645 --> 01:34:24,857
And he mucked it.
I took it down.

1487
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:29,820
"Did you have it?"
"I'm sorry, John. I don't remember."

1488
01:34:31,655 --> 01:34:34,491
I got up, and I walked
to the cashier.

1489
01:34:34,575 --> 01:34:38,120
I sat with the best
in the world, and I won.

1490
01:34:38,203 --> 01:34:42,082
You put a fucking move on Chan,
you son of a bitch.

1491
01:34:42,124 --> 01:34:45,252
So that's why you made
that run on KGB's place.

1492
01:34:45,335 --> 01:34:47,755
That's right.

1493
01:34:47,838 --> 01:34:50,507
And I'll do it again
if I can.

1494
01:34:52,176 --> 01:34:54,595
Well, then I'm rooting
for you, Mike.

1495
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,639
I'll see you around,
Knish.

1496
01:34:59,183 --> 01:35:03,228
This is temporary?
Will you be back next semester?

1497
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:06,523
Oh, I think we
both know I'm no lawyer.

1498
01:35:07,691 --> 01:35:10,569
I hope my story
didn't discourage you.

1499
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:15,657
No. It inspired me.
I think I was on my way out anyway.

1500
01:35:15,741 --> 01:35:18,744
- But now you're here.
- That's right.

1501
01:35:18,827 --> 01:35:22,414
- You're in trouble?
- Yes, sir, I am.

1502
01:35:22,498 --> 01:35:27,336
Uh, not with the law.
I owe.

1503
01:35:27,419 --> 01:35:31,298
- A gambling debt?
- Yeah.

1504
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:36,345
It's not mine. It's, uh...
I vouched for the wrong guy.

1505
01:35:36,428 --> 01:35:39,181
Um, so now it's on me.

1506
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:41,183
I understand.

1507
01:35:43,268 --> 01:35:46,271
So, what will it take
for you to be free of this?

1508
01:35:48,482 --> 01:35:51,610
- I need 15,000 tonight.
- Michael!

1509
01:35:51,693 --> 01:35:54,446
Michael!

1510
01:35:58,409 --> 01:36:01,453
- You know, I'm not
a wealthy man, Michael.
- I know.

1511
01:36:01,537 --> 01:36:04,957
And it kills me
to ask you, but...

1512
01:36:04,998 --> 01:36:07,835
I don't have
any other play here.

1513
01:36:07,876 --> 01:36:11,046
So, uh, if you can
help me at all...

1514
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:13,173
I hate to see you
like this.

1515
01:36:13,257 --> 01:36:15,676
I want to help you, Michael.
But $15,000, l... l...

1516
01:36:15,759 --> 01:36:17,636
I know.

1517
01:36:24,351 --> 01:36:26,395
If it must be tonight,

1518
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:30,983
then ten
is the best I can do.

1519
01:36:32,568 --> 01:36:34,653
Would you do that?

1520
01:36:39,158 --> 01:36:42,244
When my mother
let me leave the yeshiva,

1521
01:36:42,327 --> 01:36:45,080
it nearly broke her.

1522
01:36:45,164 --> 01:36:49,376
But she knew...
She knew the life I had to lead.

1523
01:36:51,462 --> 01:36:54,214
To do that for another
is a mitzvah.

1524
01:36:57,092 --> 01:37:00,512
And for that, I owe.

1525
01:37:14,651 --> 01:37:18,280
So you take this money...

1526
01:37:18,363 --> 01:37:21,325
and you get yourself
out of this trouble.

1527
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:23,327
You hear me?

1528
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:30,751
I know you can.

1529
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:37,758
l... I promise that I'm gonna...
I'll pay you back.

1530
01:37:38,842 --> 01:37:40,761
Good luck.

1531
01:38:02,908 --> 01:38:06,745
I've often seen these people,
these squares, at the table.

1532
01:38:06,787 --> 01:38:10,958
Short-stacked and long odds against,
all their outs gone,

1533
01:38:11,041 --> 01:38:13,752
one last card in the deck
that can help them.

1534
01:38:15,462 --> 01:38:19,800
I used to wonder how they could let
themselves get into such bad shape...

1535
01:38:19,883 --> 01:38:23,095
and how the hell they thought
they could turn it around.

1536
01:38:30,102 --> 01:38:32,604
Just walking in here
makes me queasy.

1537
01:38:32,646 --> 01:38:35,774
The brick walls.
The fucking mopes at the tables.

1538
01:38:35,858 --> 01:38:40,070
The musty smell. I feel like Buckner
walking back into Shea.

1539
01:38:40,154 --> 01:38:42,614
But what choice do I have?

1540
01:38:42,698 --> 01:38:45,534
So, you have my money?

1541
01:38:45,617 --> 01:38:48,495
- I owe you that money tomorrow, right?
- Da.

1542
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,207
So it's still mine.

1543
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:57,296
For the next eight hours,
it is yours.

1544
01:38:57,379 --> 01:39:00,716
But if you
don't have it all by then,

1545
01:39:00,799 --> 01:39:03,552
then you are mine.

1546
01:39:03,635 --> 01:39:05,554
Well...

1547
01:39:10,517 --> 01:39:15,189
I got $10,000.
I'm looking for a game.

1548
01:39:16,398 --> 01:39:19,526
- You sure?
- You heard me.

1549
01:39:23,155 --> 01:39:26,325
So, we'll play. Heads up.

1550
01:39:26,408 --> 01:39:29,620
We both start
with a couple of racks.

1551
01:39:29,703 --> 01:39:33,415
Blinds, uh, 25 and 50?

1552
01:39:33,499 --> 01:39:38,170
And we don't stop
until one of us has it all.

1553
01:39:40,214 --> 01:39:43,092
Let's do it.

1554
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:10,744
I'm gonna raise.

1555
01:40:10,828 --> 01:40:12,871
Thousand straight.

1556
01:40:12,955 --> 01:40:15,457
Very aggressive.

1557
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:18,252
A new day.

1558
01:40:18,335 --> 01:40:22,131
And you won't be pushed around.

1559
01:40:22,214 --> 01:40:25,926
But... I re-raise.

1560
01:40:26,009 --> 01:40:29,805
Five thousand.

1561
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:34,768
Doyle Brunson says,
"The key to No-Limit...

1562
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:37,563
is to put a man to a decision
for all his chips."

1563
01:40:37,604 --> 01:40:39,565
Teddy's just done it.

1564
01:40:39,606 --> 01:40:42,776
He's representing aces,
the only hand better than my cowboys.

1565
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:45,571
I can't call and give him
a chance to catch.

1566
01:40:45,654 --> 01:40:48,741
I can only fold,
if I believe him. Or...

1567
01:40:48,824 --> 01:40:51,243
I re-raise. I'm all in.

1568
01:41:21,815 --> 01:41:23,942
Take it down.

1569
01:41:31,867 --> 01:41:33,827
In a heads-up match,

1570
01:41:33,869 --> 01:41:38,040
the size of your stack is almost as
important as the quality of your cards.

1571
01:41:38,123 --> 01:41:40,709
I chopped one of his legs out
in the first hand.

1572
01:41:40,793 --> 01:41:45,089
- Now all I have to do is lean
on him until he falls over.
- Check.

1573
01:41:45,172 --> 01:41:47,633
Bet a thousand.

1574
01:41:47,674 --> 01:41:50,719
Call. I'll call.

1575
01:41:54,598 --> 01:41:56,183
Check.

1576
01:41:57,768 --> 01:42:01,396
What's that, 2,500 there?
I'm gonna tap your tap.

1577
01:42:11,073 --> 01:42:12,533
Jacks up.

1578
01:42:14,993 --> 01:42:16,912
Very good.

1579
01:42:18,622 --> 01:42:20,916
Good hand.

1580
01:42:20,999 --> 01:42:25,379
Catching that Jack
on the turn.

1581
01:42:25,462 --> 01:42:30,092
- You got lucky there.
- Yep, it was luck.

1582
01:42:30,175 --> 01:42:34,179
So, that's it then, hmm?

1583
01:42:34,221 --> 01:42:39,268
Just like a young man
coming in for a quickie.

1584
01:42:39,351 --> 01:42:44,106
I feel so unsatisfied.

1585
01:42:44,189 --> 01:42:46,108
I'm sorry.

1586
01:42:46,191 --> 01:42:49,903
You must feel proud
and good.

1587
01:42:49,987 --> 01:42:53,073
Strong enough
to beat the world.

1588
01:42:54,658 --> 01:42:59,329
- I feel fine.
- Me too. I feel okay.

1589
01:43:00,831 --> 01:43:04,376
'Course maybe we check
with one other guy, see how he feels.

1590
01:43:04,418 --> 01:43:07,045
Grama!

1591
01:43:09,923 --> 01:43:12,384
I thought I smelled him.

1592
01:43:12,426 --> 01:43:14,803
I'll take what's ours.

1593
01:43:14,887 --> 01:43:17,765
'Course you could
let it ride, Mike.

1594
01:43:17,806 --> 01:43:20,893
Take your chances.
You could let this happen, Grama?

1595
01:43:20,934 --> 01:43:22,978
Sure, partner.

1596
01:43:23,061 --> 01:43:26,231
He still has till morning
to make good.

1597
01:43:26,315 --> 01:43:31,779
Uh, you know what? I got my
five grand here. That's just fine by me.

1598
01:43:31,862 --> 01:43:35,074
- I'm going home.
- Fine.

1599
01:43:35,157 --> 01:43:37,493
It's a fucking joke anyway.

1600
01:43:37,576 --> 01:43:42,247
After all, I am paying you
with your money.

1601
01:43:45,125 --> 01:43:48,545
- What did you say?
- Your money.

1602
01:43:48,629 --> 01:43:52,049
I am still up 20 grand...

1603
01:43:52,132 --> 01:43:55,677
from this last time
I stick it in you.

1604
01:43:55,761 --> 01:43:59,932
They're trying
to goad me, trying to own me.

1605
01:44:00,015 --> 01:44:05,104
But this isn't a gunfight.
It's not about pride or ego.
It's only about money.

1606
01:44:05,187 --> 01:44:08,899
I can leave now,
even with Grama and KGB...

1607
01:44:08,982 --> 01:44:12,444
and halfway
to paying Petrovsky back.

1608
01:44:12,486 --> 01:44:14,446
That's the safe play.

1609
01:44:14,488 --> 01:44:18,200
I told Worm you can't lose
what you don't put in the middle.

1610
01:44:18,283 --> 01:44:22,121
- Deal 'em.
- But you can't win much either.

1611
01:44:24,331 --> 01:44:26,375
Checks!

1612
01:44:28,293 --> 01:44:32,256
- Double the blinds?
- Yeah.

1613
01:44:32,339 --> 01:44:34,466
Table stakes.

1614
01:44:34,508 --> 01:44:38,053
Good. Feel free
to reload at any time.

1615
01:44:54,236 --> 01:44:57,781
You must
be kicking yourself...

1616
01:44:57,865 --> 01:45:01,994
for not walking out
when you could.

1617
01:45:04,037 --> 01:45:06,498
Bad judgment.

1618
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:08,751
But...

1619
01:45:08,834 --> 01:45:11,211
don't you worry, son.

1620
01:45:11,253 --> 01:45:15,257
It will all be over soon.

1621
01:45:20,679 --> 01:45:22,347
Okay.

1622
01:45:46,622 --> 01:45:48,582
Check.

1623
01:45:50,167 --> 01:45:53,712
No check here.
I tap you.

1624
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,896
I'm laying
this down, Teddy.

1625
01:46:12,439 --> 01:46:14,775
Top two pair.

1626
01:46:14,858 --> 01:46:18,362
It's a monster hand,
and I'm gonna lay that down...

1627
01:46:18,445 --> 01:46:22,408
'cause you got two-four, and I'm
not gonna draw against a made hand.

1628
01:46:27,621 --> 01:46:31,417
Lays down a monster.

1629
01:46:37,297 --> 01:46:39,925
Should have paid me off
on that.

1630
01:46:42,386 --> 01:46:45,931
Why the fuck did you
lay that down?

1631
01:47:01,321 --> 01:47:04,825
Wow.
Not hungry?

1632
01:47:04,908 --> 01:47:08,120
Mr. Son of a Bitch.

1633
01:47:08,162 --> 01:47:11,540
Let's play some cards.

1634
01:47:11,623 --> 01:47:13,542
The rule is this:

1635
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:16,920
You spot a man's tell,
you don't say a fucking word.

1636
01:47:17,004 --> 01:47:18,922
I finally spotted KGB's.

1637
01:47:19,006 --> 01:47:23,302
And usually I would've let him
go on chewing those Oreos
till he was dead broke.

1638
01:47:23,343 --> 01:47:28,182
But I don't have that kind of time.
I've only got till morning.

1639
01:47:28,223 --> 01:47:32,603
Not even Teddy KGB's immune
to getting a little rattled.

1640
01:47:32,686 --> 01:47:36,440
Enough is enough, Teddy.
Finish the fucking kid off.

1641
01:47:36,523 --> 01:47:39,485
Hanging around.
Hanging around.

1642
01:47:39,526 --> 01:47:44,323
Kid's got alligator blood.
Can't get rid of him.

1643
01:47:47,451 --> 01:47:50,245
No, I'm not going anywhere.
Double the blind.

1644
01:47:50,329 --> 01:47:52,915
Okay.

1645
01:47:52,998 --> 01:47:54,708
I call.

1646
01:48:03,967 --> 01:48:05,886
Check.

1647
01:48:17,815 --> 01:48:20,025
Two grand.

1648
01:48:23,529 --> 01:48:25,781
All right, I'll call the two grand.
I'll gamble.

1649
01:48:25,864 --> 01:48:28,242
Don't splash the pot.

1650
01:48:29,368 --> 01:48:33,288
You're on a draw, Mike?
Go away.

1651
01:48:33,372 --> 01:48:35,707
This one
is not good for you.

1652
01:48:35,749 --> 01:48:41,213
And in my club, I will splash the pot
whenever the fuck I please.

1653
01:48:41,255 --> 01:48:43,382
Okay.

1654
01:48:51,223 --> 01:48:53,225
I'm gonna check, Teddy.

1655
01:48:54,768 --> 01:48:56,728
That's right.

1656
01:48:56,770 --> 01:49:01,233
Big daddy...

1657
01:49:01,275 --> 01:49:04,111
bets...

1658
01:49:04,194 --> 01:49:06,655
the pot.

1659
01:49:10,451 --> 01:49:12,411
That's 4,400.

1660
01:49:12,453 --> 01:49:15,831
All right, I'm gonna call you, or else
I won't respect myself tomorrow morning.

1661
01:49:15,914 --> 01:49:19,585
Respect is all you'll have left
in the morning.

1662
01:49:21,712 --> 01:49:25,257
Last card coming.

1663
01:49:35,517 --> 01:49:37,686
Check.

1664
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:41,273
It hurts, doesn't it?

1665
01:49:41,356 --> 01:49:45,569
You can't believe
what fell.

1666
01:49:45,652 --> 01:49:49,114
All your dreams... dashed.

1667
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:53,285
Hopes down
the fucking drain.

1668
01:49:53,327 --> 01:49:57,623
Your fate, he is sitting
right beside you.

1669
01:49:57,706 --> 01:50:00,626
That ace could not
have helped you.

1670
01:50:03,003 --> 01:50:07,341
I bet it all.

1671
01:50:12,805 --> 01:50:16,391
You're right, Teddy.
The ace didn't help me.

1672
01:50:18,644 --> 01:50:21,021
I flopped
a nut straight.

1673
01:50:22,815 --> 01:50:26,193
Motherfucker!

1674
01:50:26,235 --> 01:50:29,822
- Motherfucker! That is it!
- That's it?

1675
01:50:29,905 --> 01:50:31,865
What the fuck
you talking about?

1676
01:50:31,907 --> 01:50:34,159
- Take him down, Teddy.
- Nyet! Nyet! No more!

1677
01:50:34,243 --> 01:50:36,578
No! Not tonight!

1678
01:50:36,662 --> 01:50:41,375
This son of bitch,
all night he check, check, check.

1679
01:50:41,458 --> 01:50:43,377
He trapped me!

1680
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:46,046
Well, you feeling
satisfied now, Teddy?

1681
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:49,216
'Cause I can go on
busting you up all night.

1682
01:50:49,299 --> 01:50:51,927
Nyet! Nyet!

1683
01:50:57,224 --> 01:51:00,853
He beat me.
Straight up.

1684
01:51:01,895 --> 01:51:03,856
Pay him.

1685
01:51:05,149 --> 01:51:07,860
Pay that man his money.

1686
01:51:49,735 --> 01:51:53,238
Turned my ten grand
into just over 60.

1687
01:51:53,322 --> 01:51:56,909
Paid 15 to Grama, six went back
to the Chesterfield.

1688
01:51:56,992 --> 01:52:00,496
As for Worm,
well, I figure we're even.

1689
01:52:00,579 --> 01:52:03,624
And after the ten going back
to the professor,

1690
01:52:03,707 --> 01:52:08,545
I'm back where I started,
with three stacks of high society.

1691
01:52:17,638 --> 01:52:19,598
Hey.

1692
01:52:21,642 --> 01:52:26,939
- You look like hell.
- Ah, well, you should've
seen me yesterday.

1693
01:52:28,982 --> 01:52:32,236
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. You?

1694
01:52:33,821 --> 01:52:35,948
Now I am.

1695
01:52:40,577 --> 01:52:42,704
So, you're
outta here, huh?

1696
01:52:42,788 --> 01:52:48,460
Yeah, I'm... I figure
there's nothing left for me here.

1697
01:52:48,544 --> 01:52:52,464
Listen, um, will you
give this to Petrovsky?

1698
01:52:52,506 --> 01:52:56,552
I... didn't want to wake him up.
It's still a little early.

1699
01:52:56,635 --> 01:52:59,638
Can I count on you
to do that?

1700
01:52:59,721 --> 01:53:02,808
You could always count
on me, Mike.

1701
01:53:04,393 --> 01:53:06,353
Thanks.

1702
01:53:06,395 --> 01:53:08,689
Take care, Jo.

1703
01:53:10,274 --> 01:53:14,194
Hey. Call me.

1704
01:53:15,612 --> 01:53:17,531
If you need a lawyer.

1705
01:53:17,614 --> 01:53:20,159
I will.

1706
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,995
And I will.

1707
01:53:41,847 --> 01:53:43,766
Kennedy Airport.

1708
01:53:52,816 --> 01:53:56,904
- So, where you headed?
- I'm going to Vegas.

1709
01:53:56,987 --> 01:53:59,364
- Vegas, huh?
- Yeah.

1710
01:53:59,406 --> 01:54:01,366
Good luck, man.

1711
01:54:01,408 --> 01:54:04,536
People insist on calling it luck.

1712
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:06,580
Thanks.

1713
01:54:09,333 --> 01:54:12,961
First prize at the World Series
of Poker is a million bucks.

1714
01:54:13,045 --> 01:54:16,465
Does it have my name on it?
I don't know.

1715
01:54:16,548 --> 01:54:18,801
But I'm gonna find out.

1716
01:54:47,329 --> 01:54:50,082
Da, da, da, da

1717
01:54:50,124 --> 01:54:52,626
Da, da, da, da

1718
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:55,129
Da, da, da, da

1719
01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:58,340
Da, da, da, da, yeah

1720
01:54:59,842 --> 01:55:03,804
La, la, la, la, la
la, la, yeah

1721
01:55:05,973 --> 01:55:10,018
Gonna get out
on the road tonight

1722
01:55:10,102 --> 01:55:14,231
'Cause I got a hollow
in my head

1723
01:55:14,314 --> 01:55:19,445
Just checkin' it up, baby
one more time for you

1724
01:55:19,528 --> 01:55:25,534
Checkin' it up until
the pile hits the sky

1725
01:55:25,617 --> 01:55:30,289
It's like I think
I'm sick of cocaine

1726
01:55:30,330 --> 01:55:34,877
But l, I got a feelin' like
it's runnin' in my veins

1727
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:40,340
Just checkin' it up, baby
one more time for you

1728
01:55:40,424 --> 01:55:45,137
Checkin' it up until
the pile hits the sky

1729
01:55:45,179 --> 01:55:49,057
Even the best years
leave a lot to be desired

1730
01:55:49,141 --> 01:55:52,478
And then they've
passed you by

1731
01:55:57,566 --> 01:56:00,152
All these seasons

1732
01:56:00,194 --> 01:56:05,324
All this time spinnin' past
till they leave you

1733
01:56:05,407 --> 01:56:07,451
Far behind

1734
01:56:07,534 --> 01:56:12,498
Lay me down in the circle
where the spotlight shines

1735
01:56:12,539 --> 01:56:19,505
'Cause all this pleasure
gets me high

1736
01:56:25,636 --> 01:56:27,679
Da, da, da, da

1737
01:56:27,721 --> 01:56:30,265
Da, da, da, da

1738
01:56:30,349 --> 01:56:33,227
Da, da, da, da, yeah

1739
01:56:33,268 --> 01:56:35,521
Da, da, da, da

1740
01:56:35,604 --> 01:56:39,691
Some people will cut you
till you're bleedin'

1741
01:56:39,775 --> 01:56:44,113
Not me 'cause I just
wanna do it to myself

1742
01:56:44,196 --> 01:56:49,701
I'm just checkin' it up, baby
one more time for you

1743
01:56:49,743 --> 01:56:55,207
Checkin' it up until
the pile hits the sky

1744
01:56:55,249 --> 01:56:57,918
Even the best years
are a waste of time

1745
01:56:58,001 --> 01:57:02,840
But, baby
I'm a big star now

1746
01:57:02,923 --> 01:57:06,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1747
01:57:06,844 --> 01:57:09,888
All these seasons

1748
01:57:09,972 --> 01:57:15,060
All this time spinnin' past
till they leave you

1749
01:57:15,144 --> 01:57:17,104
Far behind

1750
01:57:17,146 --> 01:57:22,109
Lay me down in the circle
where the spotlight shines

1751
01:57:22,192 --> 01:57:31,827
'Cause all this pleasure
gets me high

1752
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:34,788
Oh, oh

1753
01:57:34,872 --> 01:57:37,374
Da, da, da, da

1754
01:57:37,458 --> 01:57:40,294
Da, da, da, da, ha

1755
01:57:40,377 --> 01:57:41,879
Da, da, da, da

1756
01:57:41,962 --> 01:57:44,298
A-da, a-da, da

1757
01:58:26,673 --> 01:58:29,968
All these seasons

1758
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:34,848
All this time spinnin' past
till they leave you

1759
01:58:34,932 --> 01:58:36,850
Far behind

1760
01:58:36,934 --> 01:58:42,106
Lay me down in the circle
where the spotlight shines

1761
01:58:42,189 --> 01:58:46,944
Turn your back on the people
who draw the lines

1762
01:58:47,027 --> 01:58:52,157
Put your faith in the answers
that you can't find
