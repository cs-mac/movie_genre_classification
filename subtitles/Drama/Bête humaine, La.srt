1
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:34,631
<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

2
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:37,731
<i>Once upon a time, there was a
rich merchant.</i>

3
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,931
<i>He was a kind and brave man.</i>

4
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,051
<i>After his dear wife had passed away,</i>

5
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,631
<i>he only lived for the happiness
of his six children,</i>

6
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:47,431
<i>three daughters and three sons.</i>

7
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:50,871
<i>They filled the house with the sound of
their laughter and their squabbles.</i>

8
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:55,031
We have a little guest.

9
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:56,771
She wants to hear the story as well.

10
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:00,231
We'll all make a wish.

11
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,131
But silently

12
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,731
or it will never come true.

13
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:08,331
Did you make your wish?

14
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,331
Yes!

15
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:14,131
Then, one... two... three.

16
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:27,031
Well then, would you like to hear
the rest of the story?

17
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,531
- Yes! Yes!

18
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:35,131
<i>The merchant had three ships
that made him wealthy and proud.</i>

19
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:40,531
<i>The ships' names were "The Mermaid", "The
Triton", and the largest was "The Leviathan".</i>

20
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:49,731
<i>Their holds were loaded with wonders as
they were coming back from a long voyage.</i>

21
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,431
<i>But, all of a sudden, they were caught
in a terrible storm.</i>

22
00:02:57,231 --> 00:03:00,131
<i>The ships were swept
away by enormous waves.</i>

23
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:04,231
<i>Lightning tore their sails and
broke their masts.</i>

24
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:07,151
<i>Under the surface, where coldness
and silence reigned,</i>

25
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:10,231
<i>the ocean began to sparkle
in thousands of lights.</i>

26
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:14,731
<i>The armada and its riches
sank to the bottom,</i>

27
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:17,831
<i>swallowed and lost forever.</i>

28
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:36,431
<i>After a month, having lost everything, the merchant
and his children had to leave their house,</i>

29
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:39,231
<i>their friends and their way of life.</i>

30
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:43,131
<i>Everything that had made them happy so far.</i>

31
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:02,131
I forbid you to take that!

32
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:09,231
Go on, help yourselves then.

33
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:12,031
We will take the most
valuable things with us.

34
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:13,431
Oh, no!

35
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:18,131
Put that down immediately
or I'll take your eyes out!

36
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,031
Daddybear, do something.

37
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,591
They're taking everything, our jewels,
our beds, everything.

38
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:28,131
It's the end, I want to die.

39
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:31,431
Clotilde, would you please not call me
"Daddybear" in front of these people?

40
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:33,431
And you Anne, stop talking about dying!

41
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,931
Oh, my heart! It wants to beat no more.
Are you happy now?

42
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:40,131
Farewell!

43
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:43,931
As you can see, Daddybear, it's a disaster.
What will become of us?

44
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:45,631
Someone's calling for you.

45
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:47,131
Where is Belle?

46
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:49,831
Belle, Belle. He only cares about her.

47
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:56,731
- They've lost everything.
- Oh, my God!
- I used to work for them!

48
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,731
Wake up already!

49
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:05,176
Maxime, come help us!

50
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:06,531
Put it there.

51
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:08,984
- What's inside it?
- All my books.

52
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:14,220
My notebooks, my sketches...
I know them by heart, but I don't want
to leave them here.

53
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,898
Tristan!

54
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:19,263
- What is it?
- Keep an eye on your father.

55
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:23,522
And don't let Maxime squander
what little you have left.

56
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,355
Of course. Don't worry. I promise.
Everything will be alright.

57
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,355
Be careful.

58
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:35,431
- Aha ha ha!
- Ha ha!

59
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:40,931
If I hear one more of them laughing,
I'll break his nose.

60
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:42,445
Ignore them.

61
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:47,129
Now what? Are we going to have some fun
before leaving to the country?

62
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,214
Don't you think it would
be better to stay away?

63
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,431
Belle!

64
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:01,431
Belle!

65
00:06:14,895 --> 00:06:16,453
This is for you, Mom.

66
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,619
A new life is beginning for us and
I think I'm ready.

67
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:31,314
Do you think she would have liked
to live in the countryside?

68
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,329
- She would have loved it.
- I will like it, too.

69
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,097
- I am sure.
- Obviously.

70
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:42,162
We have pride and courage in our family.

71
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,420
We will stick together as we always have.

72
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:18,414
<i>They needed some time to get
used to their new life.</i>

73
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:23,319
<i>The first night, Belle stayed up
to listen to the sounds of the countryside.</i>

74
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,324
<i>And then, with the help of her brothers</i>

75
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:30,745
<i>she decided to clean the garden and
turn their house into a beautiful haven.</i>

76
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:33,576
I have a fever.

77
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,588
Oh no, I have a wrinkle!

78
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:39,291
Aah, this bug just won't stop!

79
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:54,311
We've been living in this hell for a month.
We'll die alone and crumpled.

80
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:56,231
Devoured by beasts.

81
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:59,031
Anne, come right now!

82
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:04,804
Her again. Her happiness digusts me.
It makes me want to drown her in the well.

83
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:07,870
And I want to bury her alive
in her blasted garden.

84
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,155
What are you two doing?

85
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,716
Clotilde is feeling sick, so we will
have breakfast in bed.
- No, you won't.

86
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,853
And after lunch we'll all go
work in the garden.

87
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:23,145
- I'd rather die.
- Get up! Everybody downstairs!

88
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,177
<i>Exhausted...</i>

89
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,896
<i>comma...</i>

90
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:39,843
...pierced by arrows...

91
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:43,265
...the young man left the battlefield

92
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:45,631
and took shelter in the forest.

93
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:57,554
One could say that they were very happy
to see me at the "Maritime Affaires".

94
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,031
Dumont was very nice. Apparently,
his eldest daughter married a count.

95
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:04,131
- What? No!

96
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:07,131
But, the big news is that "The Mermaid",

97
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:09,931
your mother's favourite ship,

98
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:11,898
has been found.

99
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:16,601
She drifted along the shore and
washed up in the harbour.

100
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:18,942
- What about the load?
- Completely intact.

101
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,299
My children, I belive we are saved!

102
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:25,178
Let's pack our things. Actually no,
let's just throw everything in the fire.

103
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:29,931
I can feel my heart beating again.
I am alive, Daddybear. I am reborn.

104
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:35,961
We can't go back to town in this state. No. We'll
need new dresses, perfume, and... what else?

105
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,284
We'll make a list.

106
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,500
- Yes. We'll have the happiness of the town!
- The town, the real town!

107
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,231
Will you go with me to town?

108
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:45,402
It is time I introduced
my successor to Dumont.

109
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:49,026
I will not disappoint you, Father.
Thank you.

110
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:53,843
After defeating the last one of his
enemies, the young man returned home.

111
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,782
Triumphant and acknowledged by his people.

112
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,616
The end.

113
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:05,323
- A new novel, my brother?
- Something even better. This one
will be a masterpiece.

114
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,287
What are you doing??

115
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Are you angry?

116
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,566
Obviously. When a girl is sad,
they say she's angry.

117
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,298
And when she's too happy,
they say she's crazy.

118
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:33,914
How can you expect to be understood?
Everybody's happy but you.

119
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:43,329
I would have liked to stay here longer.
That's all.

120
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:45,072
There he is.

121
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:50,072
We only came here to hide our shame,
but our life is not here.

122
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,832
You know as well as I do
what's going to happen.

123
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:55,852
Maxime will hang out with those rogues
he calls friends again.

124
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:59,521
Anne and Clotilde will go out
every evening to look for husbands.

125
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,325
And you will always be busy with your work.

126
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:05,729
Belle, one day or another we will
no longer be together.

127
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,238
You will grow up and you will want
to start your own life.

128
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:13,251
But that won't mean we don't love each other any more.
It will only mean that you've grown up.

129
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:17,581
Be sure not to forget anything.
Clotilde won't take it very well.

130
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:24,640
And you, what would you
like me to bring for you?

131
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:31,221
Only a rose.
I couldn't grow any here.

132
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:01,270
<i>They have taken everything from me.</i>

133
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:04,819
<i>They even refuse to let me board my ship.</i>

134
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:07,006
You have to accept the situation.

135
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:11,540
"The Mermaid" and all its load
don't belong to you any more.

136
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:15,355
They treat me like I were nothing,

137
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,770
when without me this place would still
be a fishing port. And you allow this!

138
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,310
You seem to be lacking common sense,
my poor friend.

139
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:27,231
You signed all the promissory notes,

140
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:29,631
even though I warned you not to.

141
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:33,732
Don't patronize me, Dumont.

142
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,676
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't
be sitting behind this desk.

143
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:40,936
Have you lost your manners as well as
your wealth?

144
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:43,763
- I am going to smash your head!
- Stop that immediately!

145
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:50,198
Don't you understand?
You no longer have any power.

146
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:55,469
You're supposed to be a wealthy,
important man, but you're nothing.

147
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,597
I feel sorry for you, Father.

148
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:08,879
Maxime!

149
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:30,153
I see a man. You should be careful.

150
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:33,352
He will bring you important news.

151
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:41,292
- News? Good or bad?
- You know very well that depends on the other cards.

152
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,807
Don't you want to please me, Astrid?

153
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:49,700
Tell me something exciting.

154
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:53,417
I am like the cards love,
I can't lie to you.

155
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:56,698
Did I not warn you about your scar?

156
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:15,531
A torrent of gold under an emerald moon.

157
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:17,889
Your fate is smiling at you.

158
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:21,309
Gold, emeralds! Ha ha ha!

159
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:24,014
Come on, my vermins!

160
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:28,512
Didn't I tell you that we'd become rich?

161
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:31,584
This is a bad night. It
smells like gunpowder.

162
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,889
- What would you like?
- I am looking for my son.

163
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:39,928
- I was told that he often comes here.
- I am used to hearing that. But still,
I feel sorry for you.

164
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,868
What is your son's name?

165
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,483
Maxime de Beaufremont.

166
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:53,755
You should have spoken more quietly. I will have
to let you leave through the back entrance.

167
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,024
- But I have to find my son!
- You're not the only one.

168
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:04,720
Quickly, go behind the counter.

169
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:13,357
Your scent...

170
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,637
your prophecies...

171
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,163
You have too much power over me.

172
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,546
Monsieur de Beaufremont.

173
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:37,349
I have been looking for Maxime for months
and I come across his old father.

174
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,849
I don't know you.

175
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:46,328
- Who are you?
- Perducas. At your service.

176
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:54,596
Your little boy owes me a lot of money.

177
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:59,326
That's why you and I will strike a deal
and everything will be forgiven.

178
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,379
My son is not a gambler!

179
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,619
Serve them a round of drinks so that
they may leave me in peace.

180
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,855
He thinks we are lying to him.

181
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,981
You won't be doing that here, Perducas.

182
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,090
You know that.

183
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:18,318
Leave the poor man alone.

184
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,408
All right.

185
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:38,160
Move back.
And you, go quickly behind the counter.

186
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:41,091
Go on, hurry up!

187
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:46,151
I wish you luck because he won't leave you
alone. Now leave, quickly!

188
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:44,851
<i>On his way home,</i>

189
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:49,571
<i>the merchant struggled with the wind,
the cold and the sadness.</i>

190
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:52,194
<i>He had left the town without Maxime.</i>

191
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:56,269
<i>He pictured him wandering, in the gutters,</i>

192
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:59,052
<i>or worse, lying dead in an alley.</i>

193
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,741
<i>He pulled the reins of his horse,</i>

194
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:06,041
<i>hoping to return home as soon as
possible, and find his son waiting.</i>

195
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:10,443
I don't even have a weapon to end
your misery.

196
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:17,404
Forgive me.

197
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:57,518
The house.

198
00:19:57,618 --> 00:19:59,418
I made it!

199
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,937
But this is not the house.

200
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:31,441
Is anyone there?

201
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:46,851
I've lost my way.

202
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:51,911
And the door was open.

203
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:30,621
Who's there?

204
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:03,521
Am I dreaming?

205
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:08,467
Or have I died and gone to heaven?

206
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:12,961
No, I am quite alive.

207
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:15,591
And I'm hungry.

208
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:31,751
I will help myself to some of the things
on the table. All right?

209
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:49,101
The dresses...

210
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:53,751
The shawls...

211
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:56,441
The blusher...

212
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,671
Incredible, all these things are here.

213
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:03,371
Well, almost all.

214
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:21,024
But who took care of you?

215
00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:00,698
Are my presents not enough for you? Do you
also have to steal what I tresure most?

216
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:07,621
I won't be treated as a thief nor a coward.

217
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:11,488
I am a just and honourable man.

218
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:13,641
Who did you pick this rose for?

219
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:21,764
My youngest daughter.
She is the most precious thing to me.

220
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:26,281
Then I will give you one day
to say goodbye to your loved ones.

221
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:30,361
You only need to whisper the words:
"more than anything in the world,"

222
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:34,704
to your horse, and he will bring you here.

223
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:39,841
- I will not return.
- Oh, yes you will.

224
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:44,884
Otherwise, I will kill all your family,
one after another.

225
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:49,596
I will kill your youngest daughter last,
since she's your favorite.

226
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:53,681
Remember...

227
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:57,788
A life for a rose.

228
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:21,304
There! Yes, it's him!
I can see him down there!

229
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:25,304
Father! Father!!

230
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:40,411
This story about a beast and a rose,
it makes no sense.

231
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,711
Well how do you explain that then?
You can very well see it's real.

232
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:47,598
<i>More than anything in the world.</i>

233
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:53,552
- And as if by magic the horse will find its way to the castle?
- It's our fault, it's all our fault.

234
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:56,771
- It wasn't you who asked for that flower.
- It's nobody's fault!

235
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:58,871
Silence.

236
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,301
I can not tell you who
this Beast is, but...

237
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:08,282
for having stolen this rose,
I have to go back there in a few hours.

238
00:29:11,391 --> 00:29:15,206
- What will he do to you?
- I do not know, Tristan.

239
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:19,027
He said - "a life for a rose".

240
00:29:21,671 --> 00:29:26,779
- And if you don't comply?
- Then we'll die.

241
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,393
All of us.

242
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,341
Don't say anything.
I know what they're all thinking.

243
00:29:57,021 --> 00:30:02,203
- That Mum died while giving birth to me.
- I don't understand what you mean.

244
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:06,341
I will not be responsible
for your death as well!

245
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,520
<i>Belle! Belle!</i>

246
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:19,031
<i>Belle!</i>

247
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:21,591
Don't forget to love me.

248
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:25,116
<i>Belle! Belle!</i>

249
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,616
<i>Belle!</i>

250
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:33,296
- Belle!
- Father, no! Father!

251
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:57,161
Guide me to the castle and
take me to that Beast.

252
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,958
More than anything in the world.

253
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:53,001
<i>A life for a rose.</i>

254
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:31,383
<i>Belle was ready to die
as she heard the first strike of the bell.</i>

255
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:35,061
<i>But as she explored the
castle of the Beast,</i>

256
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:39,181
<i>a noise, stronger and more beautiful
than that of the bell,</i>

257
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,031
<i>started to resound in all her being.</i>

258
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:45,011
<i>It was the beating of his heart.</i>

259
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,321
My name is Belle.

260
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:26,261
I came to exchange my life
for the life of my father.

261
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:31,106
Sit down.

262
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,663
Eat.

263
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:08,711
When you have regained your strength,

264
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:12,687
you can go for a walk
anywhere on the estate.

265
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:17,181
But when night falls,
I forbid you to go out of the castle.

266
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:21,635
If I must die, let it be now.

267
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,788
You have more courage than your father.

268
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,901
Every evening, at this hour,
you have to be here.

269
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,769
Don't even think about escaping.

270
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:38,191
The forest will close in on you.

271
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:55,561
- Would you like me to stop reading?
- No, I want to hear the rest.

272
00:37:55,691 --> 00:38:01,681
- It makes me sad that she's all alone. Poor her.
- That's true, she felt very much alone.

273
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:06,821
<i>While she was climbing the immense
staircase, Belle realised that</i>

274
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:11,181
<i>she had never been away
from her family before.</i>

275
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:13,492
<i>But what she didn't know
was that in her room</i>

276
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:16,835
<i>the Tadommes were waiting for her,</i>

277
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:19,441
<i>the little cratures inhabiting the castle.</i>

278
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:23,041
<i>They were going to become her best friends.</i>

279
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:43,916
...sleep... dream...

280
00:39:52,316 --> 00:39:55,223
...sleep... dream... she's sleeping...
listen to our voices...

281
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:07,246
...come to the mirror...

282
00:40:57,591 --> 00:41:01,101
- They're coming.
- Ah, they yell, they're dirty and boisterous. They annoy me.

283
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:04,851
- But one of them will win your heart.
- Well, then I'll make his life a living hell.

284
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:12,801
Here they are.

285
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:43,581
I always knew you weren't faithful to me.

286
00:41:45,311 --> 00:41:46,991
And now, I am going to eat you.

287
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:01,251
Get your filthy hands off her!

288
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,881
Well, my friend, since you didn't catch
the doe, you won't be getting a reward.

289
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:11,061
- You still haven't stopped hunting the doe?
- She has been eluding me for years.

290
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:14,935
But I will catch her, I can feel it.
An she will be my biggest trophy.

291
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:18,731
After you.

292
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:24,400
Look at the present we gave him.
Golden arrows, like the skin of the doe.

293
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:28,088
Let's go, I'm thirsty.

294
00:42:28,188 --> 00:42:30,310
We need to drink.

295
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:51,575
Still, he should have joined me.

296
00:42:53,131 --> 00:42:54,931
I've had enough.

297
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:14,955
You smell like a beast.

298
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:37,291
Love, I want to ask you something.

299
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:41,421
- What?
- I want you to stop hunting the doe.

300
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:54,051
- But why? - I don't want you to be gone
for days on end trying to catch her.

301
00:43:55,651 --> 00:44:00,167
I feel terribly lonely here, without you.

302
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:04,491
All right.

303
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:07,861
But under one condition.

304
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,177
Give me a son.

305
00:44:47,411 --> 00:44:53,811
<i>Belle was afraid of leaving her room for a long time. She
was afraid that the Beast would be hiding in the shadows.</i>

306
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:57,388
<i>But her curiosity was
stronger than her fear.</i>

307
00:44:57,551 --> 00:45:03,171
<i>She wanted to explore the estate and
see just how far her prison stretched.</i>

308
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:14,000
Princess...

309
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:17,621
<i>That was how Belle realised
that many years ago,</i>

310
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,831
<i>or maybe even centuries ago,</i>

311
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:24,672
<i>there lived and loved another woman,
who died in that damned castle.</i>

312
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:27,903
"Why me?" - she asked the statue sadly.

313
00:47:28,003 --> 00:47:30,142
"Why do you disturb my dreams?"

314
00:47:30,242 --> 00:47:33,495
Feeling very sad, Belle ran to her room,

315
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:38,237
to wait for the bell that announced
her meeting with her strange prisoner.

316
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:41,841
You're late.

317
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:51,331
- Do you like your new dress?
- Don't come to my room ever again.

318
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:55,081
- I would like to remind you that I have every right to.
- We'll see about that.

319
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:01,721
Don't look at me. Eat.

320
00:48:02,031 --> 00:48:04,966
- And you, don't you eat?
- No.

321
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:06,601
Not in front of you.

322
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:09,981
May I talk or should I eat in silence
like a child?

323
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:12,741
It's what you are. An arrogant child.

324
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:16,521
I like it when people think
I am childish and useless.

325
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:18,821
- That way...
- You talk too much!

326
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:29,911
I am sure that you like it, the
fact that I fill the void.

327
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:34,571
- Who does this castle belong to?
- Everything here belongs to me.

328
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:39,211
You sound like any other men.
It's pretty disappointing.

329
00:48:43,361 --> 00:48:45,892
Do I disappoint you, my love?

330
00:48:46,642 --> 00:48:49,823
Is there anything else
you don't like about me?

331
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,643
Are you not going to say anything else?

332
00:48:56,821 --> 00:48:59,513
I've been waiting night and day for
you to decide my destiny.

333
00:49:00,013 --> 00:49:03,124
You're playing with me as if I were
a mouse in your paws.

334
00:49:03,224 --> 00:49:08,671
If you accept my offer...
I would fulfill all your desires.

335
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:12,991
You think that a beast like you can make
a woman like me happy?

336
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:19,386
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!

337
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:21,111
I know what I am!

338
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:23,841
You can resist me all you want,

339
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:27,524
but you will be mine!

340
00:49:58,341 --> 00:50:02,630
"Eat! Don't look at me!"
Do this, do that.

341
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,873
I will show him!

342
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:26,673
What is this?

343
00:50:28,681 --> 00:50:30,351
Oh, it's me!

344
00:50:31,151 --> 00:50:33,932
It's a spitting image of me.

345
00:50:34,091 --> 00:50:36,111
What a wonderful gift.

346
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:49,080
I wonder who could have made
such a beautiful doll?

347
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:56,776
Where are you hiding?

348
00:50:56,876 --> 00:50:59,183
Come out, I won't eat you.

349
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:11,345
I will put it here. That way I will always
have it close by.

350
00:51:55,681 --> 00:51:57,045
...listen to our song...

351
00:52:20,411 --> 00:52:21,991
My friends,

352
00:52:22,941 --> 00:52:24,551
today is a big day.

353
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:29,241
Our kingdom will finally have an heir.

354
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:39,703
And you, madam?

355
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,655
Would you like me to
make you a little heir?

356
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:47,829
- You need a kingdom for that.
- Let's pray he doesn't look like his father.

357
00:52:52,621 --> 00:52:57,259
- What are you thinking about?
- The first time we met.

358
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,162
At the river.

359
00:53:00,581 --> 00:53:05,991
You approached the bank and you
pretended to be undressing.

360
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:09,071
You were drowning.

361
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:12,831
I can swim better than you.

362
00:53:18,011 --> 00:53:20,068
What if we went back to our room?

363
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:25,381
Don't forget your promise.

364
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:28,611
Which one?

365
00:53:31,061 --> 00:53:32,601
The golden doe.

366
00:54:09,201 --> 00:54:12,561
<i>When she woke up, Belle went
to explore the castle.</i>

367
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:16,011
<i>She was determined to solve
the mystery of the Beast.</i>

368
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:19,901
<i>She got lost in a maze of corridors
and crumbling bridges</i>

369
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:25,128
<i>but feeling that she was being followed.</i>

370
00:56:39,621 --> 00:56:42,168
I apologize for last night.

371
00:56:43,461 --> 00:56:48,220
You were right. You do
fill an immense void.

372
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:52,997
Do you like my gifts?

373
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:58,391
- Why don't you answer?
- I miss my family.

374
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:02,971
Forget them. They no longer exist.

375
00:57:03,091 --> 00:57:05,991
For you it may be convenient
not to think of the past.

376
00:57:06,231 --> 00:57:09,488
- But I can't give it up.
- What do you know about me? Nothing.

377
00:57:09,651 --> 00:57:13,401
Nothing. You are right.

378
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:17,081
I would like to propose a deal.

379
00:57:18,991 --> 00:57:23,971
- A few hours with my family.
- For what?

380
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:26,791
A dance.

381
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:31,201
You will let me see them in return.

382
00:57:31,951 --> 00:57:39,271
- You're doing this out of pity for me.
- I will lead the dance if it scares you so much.

383
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:48,996
Dancing with me doesn't scare you?

384
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:52,521
Just let yourself go.

385
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:25,026
Can you love me?

386
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:32,791
We had a deal. Hold your promise.

387
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,921
It's been a long time that I
no longer make any promises.

388
01:00:39,211 --> 01:00:41,472
You wrap yourself in princely clothes,

389
01:00:41,831 --> 01:00:46,261
you think you're a man, but you're
nothing but a cruel and lonely beast.

390
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:49,631
You can try all you want,
bribe me, beitch me,

391
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,510
but you will always disgust me!

392
01:03:53,055 --> 01:03:55,496
Now you know exactly what I am.

393
01:03:56,831 --> 01:04:00,551
Tell me again that I digust you.
Tell me!

394
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:03,042
I will let you see your
family one last time.

395
01:05:03,587 --> 01:05:07,675
Really? You're not saying
this to torture me?

396
01:05:10,431 --> 01:05:12,491
You have one day.

397
01:05:13,101 --> 01:05:16,571
No more. You'll leave at dawn.

398
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:50,119
- Give me your hand.
- Which one?

399
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:52,661
I don't know. I doesn't matter.
The left one.

400
01:05:53,221 --> 01:05:56,841
- You're not going to give me a ring?
- Just be quiet a little.

401
01:05:58,161 --> 01:05:59,711
Listen.

402
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:05,651
You know the power of this water.

403
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:08,611
If you get hurt,

404
01:06:10,951 --> 01:06:14,251
- if anything happens to you at all...
- Nothing will happen to me.

405
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:16,551
I must get ready.

406
01:06:22,401 --> 01:06:27,481
- Belle, if you don't come back...
- I know, you will kill us all.

407
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:32,521
No. I will die.

408
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:41,524
I'll be here tomorrow. At this time.

409
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:04,261
Who's there?
I'm warning you, I am armed!

410
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:10,471
Belle!

411
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:40,271
The house is a mess.

412
01:07:40,461 --> 01:07:43,411
- What are you doing with these weapons?
- Ask Maxime.

413
01:07:43,521 --> 01:07:47,281
- Shut your mouth. Go back to your post, damn it.
- Go back to my post?

414
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:50,299
- You think you're a general? What an idiot.
- Enough, enough.

415
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,021
- You're not going to start this again?
- Stop defending him.

416
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:56,521
- You're so scared, you keep drinking wine all day.
- Me scared?

417
01:07:56,621 --> 01:07:59,251
- Stop it! Stop it!
- What is going on here?

418
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:01,021
Have you all gone crazy?

419
01:08:05,021 --> 01:08:08,898
Come on up. Everything will be fine.
Don't worry.

420
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:12,175
Selling us as slaves to pay for
Maxime's debts is out of the question.

421
01:08:12,275 --> 01:08:14,883
They will put us on a ship full of
sweating sailors.

422
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,954
Will they make us clean the hull?

423
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:22,305
We'll tell them that we're sea-sick
and that we don't know how to clean.

424
01:08:22,405 --> 01:08:24,205
Oh, yes!

425
01:08:25,871 --> 01:08:27,871
Anne?

426
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:29,551
Clotilde?

427
01:08:30,851 --> 01:08:34,971
- I have come back.
- Clotilde, do you see what I see?

428
01:08:35,071 --> 01:08:38,002
It's Belle's ghost, come to haunt us.

429
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:42,115
- All in red, covered in blood.
- You're not dreaming, my dear sisters.

430
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:46,569
It's really me.
I came to say goodbye for the last time.

431
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:50,731
- Even dead she's more beautiful than us.
- Just look at her tiny waist.

432
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:55,701
- Know that I will always love you.
- We love you too, sweetheart. We think about you all the time.

433
01:08:55,811 --> 01:09:00,363
- She made me take your room.
- Oh no, what have you done?

434
01:09:00,463 --> 01:09:02,754
I will have my revenge.

435
01:09:05,701 --> 01:09:07,251
Where's Dad?

436
01:09:07,381 --> 01:09:11,026
He's been so sad since you left,
that he won't wake up.

437
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:18,423
What kind of a dress is that?

438
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:26,300
Dad?

439
01:09:31,561 --> 01:09:33,862
It's me.

440
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:35,962
Belle.

441
01:09:37,362 --> 01:09:38,862
I'm here.

442
01:09:42,951 --> 01:09:44,551
Wake up, dear Father.

443
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:48,901
Do it for me.

444
01:09:52,074 --> 01:09:53,643
Dad.

445
01:09:54,443 --> 01:09:56,043
Dad.

446
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:07,571
Have you ever seen a stone this big?

447
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:12,651
- Do you remember the trunks Father brought from the castle>?
- Oh no, don't even think about it. I forbid you.

448
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:17,961
- It's our only chance, Tristan.
- You'll only go out this door over my dead body.

449
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:48,188
Look at how her flank is shaking.

450
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:51,321
I can almost feel her smell.

451
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:54,401
- Her time has come.
- She's mine, understood?

452
01:14:23,821 --> 01:14:26,881
I am the nymph of the forest.

453
01:14:30,288 --> 01:14:33,331
I had the right to take a human form.

454
01:14:35,266 --> 01:14:38,373
I wanted to know the
thing humans call love.

455
01:14:42,021 --> 01:14:45,520
I had you. My prince.

456
01:14:45,921 --> 01:14:47,212
Forgive me.

457
01:14:57,671 --> 01:14:59,356
Father.

458
01:15:03,986 --> 01:15:05,541
God of the forest.

459
01:15:08,691 --> 01:15:10,547
Spare the one I adore.

460
01:15:11,911 --> 01:15:15,361
He gave me eternal love.

461
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:19,586
Father... spare him.

462
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:03,546
<i>A terrible voice resounded in the sky:</i>

463
01:16:03,736 --> 01:16:07,361
<i>"For having killed mmy daughter
I will make you a beast."</i>

464
01:16:07,546 --> 01:16:09,945
<i>Only a woman will be able to save you.</i>

465
01:16:10,046 --> 01:16:14,605
<i>But who would love you?
Be cursed for eternity.</i>

466
01:16:31,811 --> 01:16:35,992
You're betraying Belle.

467
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:38,041
I'm saving us. She'll understand.

468
01:16:38,781 --> 01:16:41,080
You'd like to have one more
brother like me, right?

469
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:53,371
What are you doing here, my rabbit?

470
01:16:53,831 --> 01:16:57,591
Weren't we supposed to meet at your shack?
Look.

471
01:16:57,761 --> 01:17:01,666
My boys dressed up just
to meet your sisters.

472
01:17:03,261 --> 01:17:06,821
- I have a proposition for you.
- I'm not making any more deals with you.

473
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:08,551
I've been very patient.

474
01:17:10,521 --> 01:17:12,061
Look.

475
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:19,241
It's from an abandoned castle. I'll take you there and you'll
get the rest of the treasure. And you'll forget my debt.

476
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:27,955
- How many stones like this one are there?
- There are trunks full of them.

477
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:34,142
Don't disappoint me, my rabbit.
This is your last chance. You know that.

478
01:17:34,471 --> 01:17:36,596
Tell your men to follow me.

479
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:40,731
Do what he says.

480
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:49,198
"More than anything in the world."

481
01:17:59,911 --> 01:18:02,580
<i>While they were galloping through
the enchanted forest.</i>

482
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,484
<i>Perducas was thinking about the treasure
that awaited him.</i>

483
01:18:05,584 --> 01:18:08,981
<i>He was cursing his men, not wanting
to share his treasure with them.</i>

484
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:14,091
<i>He looked at Astrid and wondered wether
he'd prefer love or wealth.</i>

485
01:18:14,261 --> 01:18:19,941
<i>Sometimes the human spirit is troubled, its
beliefs are shaken, and only doubt is left.</i>

486
01:18:20,111 --> 01:18:23,111
<i>Meanwhile, Belle was reliving the story
of the prince who became a beast,</i>

487
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:26,289
<i>when she heard a heart-breaking groan.</i>

488
01:18:59,141 --> 01:19:00,751
My child!

489
01:19:05,101 --> 01:19:06,987
I missed you so much!

490
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:14,081
Belle!
Oh my God!

491
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,891
Anne! Clotilde! Come quickly!

492
01:19:18,531 --> 01:19:20,191
I was so scared.

493
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:24,912
Something in you has changed.

494
01:19:25,441 --> 01:19:27,263
Your eyes.

495
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:32,626
- And your voice...
- I have to leave, Father.

496
01:19:33,953 --> 01:19:36,151
I have to go back there.

497
01:19:42,651 --> 01:19:46,708
- Wait, I want to stay here!
- This is the happiest day of my life!

498
01:19:47,821 --> 01:19:51,001
Careful, you'll crush me!

499
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:24,701
Did you feel something?

500
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:28,547
Danger. I can feel it, it's everywhere.

501
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:37,721
Everything we desire, right?

502
01:20:41,821 --> 01:20:43,411
Let's go.

503
01:20:43,551 --> 01:20:45,621
You three, go to the west.

504
01:20:46,361 --> 01:20:49,071
The others, take the east.

505
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:52,601
You my rabbits, you will go in front of me.

506
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:51,301
...Astrid...

507
01:21:54,711 --> 01:22:01,801
...enough fear... enough blood...
...save your life...

508
01:22:13,711 --> 01:22:16,101
...take the gold in your hands...

509
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:20,901
...Astrid... Astrid...

510
01:22:37,031 --> 01:22:39,872
Where are my brothers? I have to hurry.

511
01:22:41,781 --> 01:22:43,919
Maxime took the horse.

512
01:22:44,051 --> 01:22:47,611
I tried to stop them, but...
Forgive me, Belle.

513
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:30,481
I hate it when you're far from me.
Where were you?

514
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:34,101
If I tell that we have to leave now,
will you follow me?

515
01:23:35,451 --> 01:23:38,751
- Is this gold?
- This arrow is very powerful.

516
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:42,058
I feel that this will give
us more than just wealth.

517
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:45,036
We will be respected. We'll
be above everything.

518
01:23:45,231 --> 01:23:47,175
Open your eyes.

519
01:23:47,341 --> 01:23:50,092
We've finally found what
we've always wanted.

520
01:23:55,922 --> 01:23:59,961
How do I know you won't come back
here later to steal my treasure?

521
01:24:00,111 --> 01:24:04,261
If you don't believe me any more,
belive the prophecy of the cards.

522
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:07,101
- What have you seen?
- Death.

523
01:24:07,951 --> 01:24:11,937
- Yours or mine?
- Which do you prefer?

524
01:24:12,037 --> 01:24:14,065
Neither, my love.

525
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:21,931
And since you're not sure about anything, we'll
say that this one over here will die tonight.

526
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,501
Well?

527
01:24:30,741 --> 01:24:33,421
This gate will not open by itself.

528
01:25:29,031 --> 01:25:31,171
An abandoned castle you say, ha?

529
01:26:14,011 --> 01:26:17,811
Buck up, my rogues! We have to visit
the floors as well.

530
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,511
We should find another way.

531
01:26:40,141 --> 01:26:43,937
It's the ribbon I lost on my way here.
It can't be too far from here.

532
01:26:46,691 --> 01:26:48,251
Belle, what are you doing?

533
01:26:48,531 --> 01:26:50,121
Belle, stop, you'll hurt yourself.

534
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:54,301
Belle, come back! Come back, Belle!

535
01:26:56,841 --> 01:26:58,491
Belle, please, come back!

536
01:26:59,001 --> 01:27:00,551
Belle!

537
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:39,951
God of the forest,

538
01:27:40,851 --> 01:27:42,431
hear me.

539
01:27:44,641 --> 01:27:46,703
Let me go back to him.

540
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:49,022
It's my only wish.

541
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:52,392
My one desire.

542
01:28:34,081 --> 01:28:37,281
You were wrong. There was no one
waiting for us on the inside.

543
01:28:38,251 --> 01:28:41,901
Don't spoil the fun. I am rich.

544
01:28:42,754 --> 01:28:45,171
Now, I can fulfill all your desires.

545
01:28:45,281 --> 01:28:49,677
- My desire that we would die together?
- Your cards don't decide any more.

546
01:28:49,777 --> 01:28:51,475
I decide.

547
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:08,065
What's wrong with him?
Why is he screaming?

548
01:32:33,856 --> 01:32:36,729
- Where are our brothers?
- Over there, with Perducas.

549
01:32:42,795 --> 01:32:44,638
He will kill them!

550
01:33:08,731 --> 01:33:10,387
Maxime!

551
01:33:16,144 --> 01:33:18,413
Save yourself. Ask Belle to forgive me.

552
01:33:18,513 --> 01:33:20,473
- No.
- Go, leave!

553
01:33:20,886 --> 01:33:23,706
You can ask her yourself.

554
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:36,182
Stop!

555
01:33:47,228 --> 01:33:48,979
You, my little one,

556
01:33:49,501 --> 01:33:51,146
you will help me.

557
01:33:58,651 --> 01:34:00,251
Let her go!

558
01:34:02,369 --> 01:34:04,701
What are you?

559
01:34:04,871 --> 01:34:09,091
- A lion? A big cat?
- The one who will drain your blood.

560
01:34:09,391 --> 01:34:11,727
You can purr as long as you want.

561
01:34:11,911 --> 01:34:16,381
But if you don't want me to damage
your doll, you'll let me go.

562
01:34:52,811 --> 01:34:54,461
I beg you!

563
01:34:55,701 --> 01:34:58,021
Remember that you were a man.

564
01:34:59,101 --> 01:35:02,481
Spare this vermin and let my brothers go.

565
01:35:04,293 --> 01:35:06,346
The important thing is that I'm here.

566
01:35:06,546 --> 01:35:08,359
That I will stay with you.

567
01:35:56,245 --> 01:35:58,081
Help me!

568
01:36:07,456 --> 01:36:09,900
Come on, quickly!

569
01:37:14,151 --> 01:37:15,266
Don't leave me!

570
01:37:28,146 --> 01:37:31,044
Love, your fate will be just like mine.

571
01:37:46,921 --> 01:37:49,001
Come help me!

572
01:37:49,421 --> 01:37:51,281
Hurry up!

573
01:37:56,851 --> 01:37:58,486
Put him in the pool, quickly!

574
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:29,231
He's not breathing.

575
01:38:37,056 --> 01:38:39,698
Don't worry about us. Come on, brothers.

576
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:41,151
We've missed our dinner.

577
01:39:45,441 --> 01:39:47,841
You say that as if you regretted it.

578
01:39:50,021 --> 01:39:51,551
Belle.

579
01:39:52,801 --> 01:39:57,661
Do you think that with a little patience,

580
01:39:58,041 --> 01:39:59,891
or maybe out of habit,

581
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:03,251
you could have...

582
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:06,877
loved me?

583
01:40:10,189 --> 01:40:12,209
But I already love you.

584
01:42:37,141 --> 01:42:38,951
<i>Well, the story is over.</i>

585
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:41,501
<i>It's time to sleep.</i>

586
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:44,821
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

587
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:58,271
What about the brothers and the sisters?
What happened to them?

588
01:42:58,831 --> 01:43:02,871
<i>They all went back to town. The brothers
opened a printing house, to print books.</i>

589
01:43:03,111 --> 01:43:08,161
<i>And the sisters married two twins, and they
couldn't tell them apart.</i>

590
01:43:08,311 --> 01:43:12,196
That way they are all happy together.
And their father?

591
01:43:12,381 --> 01:43:14,551
He opened a flower shop.

592
01:43:14,731 --> 01:43:18,172
- Him too?
- Yes, him too.

593
01:43:20,855 --> 01:43:22,474
Sweet dreams.

594
01:43:26,175 --> 01:43:28,954
- Mummy...
- Sleep, my dears.
