1
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,228
For more than a year, ominous rumors
had been privately circulating...

2
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:45,633
among high-level Western leaders...

3
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:49,408
that the Soviet Union had been at work
on what was darkly hinted to be...

4
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:53,019
the ultimate weapon:
a doomsday device.

5
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,832
Intelligence sources traced the site
of the top-secret Russian project...

6
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:59,483
to the perpetually
fog-shrouded wasteland...

7
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:02,816
below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.

8
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:08,000
What they were building or why it was
located in a remote, desolate place...

9
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,238
no one could say.

10
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:35,783
General Ripper, sir.

11
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:37,703
Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

12
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,677
This is General Ripper speaking.

13
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,857
- Yes, sir.
- Do you recognize my voice?

14
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:44,231
I do, sir. Why do you ask?

15
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:45,988
Why do you think?

16
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:49,504
I don't know, sir. We spoke
just a few moments ago, didn't we?

17
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:54,597
You don't think I'd ask unless it was
pretty damned important, do you?

18
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,040
No, I don't.

19
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:58,212
Let's see if we can stay on the ball.

20
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,601
Has the Wing confirmed holding
at their fail-safe points?

21
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:04,390
Yes, sir. The confirmations
have just come in.

22
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:07,938
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.

23
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,693
The base is being put on condition red.

24
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:12,900
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

25
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,168
Condition red. Jolly good.
Keeps the men on their toes.

26
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:18,405
This is not an exercise.

27
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:21,223
Not an exercise?

28
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:27,298
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're
a good officer and have a right ot know.

29
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,226
It looks like we're in a shooting war.

30
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:34,943
- Oh, hell. Are the Russians involved?
- That's all I've been told.

31
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:39,591
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight.

32
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,034
Now, I want you to transmit Plan R...

33
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,963
R for Robert, to the Wing.

34
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:49,291
- Plan R for Robert.
- Is it that bad, sir?

35
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,745
- Looks like it's pretty hairy.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,761
Plan R for Robert.

37
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,032
Last and possibly most important...

38
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:01,158
I want all privately owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

39
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:05,004
They might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs.

40
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,819
As I previously arranged, Air Police
will have lists of all owners.

41
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:11,714
I want every one collected
without exception.

42
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,993
After you've done that,
report back to me.

43
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:42,567
In order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack...

44
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:45,932
America's Strategic Air Command
maintains...

45
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:49,958
a large force of B-52 bombers
airborne 24 hours a day.

46
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:54,732
Each B-52 can deliver
a nuclear bomb load of 50 megatons...

47
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:59,620
equal to 16 times the total
explosive force of all the bombs...

48
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:04,071
and shells used by all the armies
in World War II.

49
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:07,144
Based in America,
the Airborne Alert Force...

50
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:09,899
is deployed from the persian Gulf
to the Arctic Ocean.

51
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:12,649
But they have one geographical factor
in common.

52
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:16,515
They are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.

53
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:36,136
Major Kong, I know you'll think
this is crazy...

54
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:39,723
but I just got a message from base
over the C.R.M. 114.

55
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:44,552
It decodes as Wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.

56
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:51,630
Goldie, did you say
Wing attack Plan R?

57
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,160
Yes, sir, I have.

58
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,325
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys that I don't want...

59
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,250
horsing around on the airplane?

60
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:05,486
I'm not horsing around.
That's how it decodes.

61
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:08,109
I've been to one world fair,
a picnic...

62
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,889
and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest
thing I heard over earphones.

63
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,778
You sure you got today's code?

64
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:16,203
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,732
There's gotta be something wrong.

66
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:21,073
Wait a second, I'm coming back.

67
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:57,646
Maybe you'd better get
a confirmation from base.

68
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:59,091
Yes, sir.

69
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,838
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

70
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,423
You know, give the go code and then
recall to see who would actually go?

71
00:09:25,494 --> 00:09:29,456
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

72
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,828
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R...

73
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:34,415
unless them Ruskies had already
clobbered Washington...

74
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:36,692
and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

75
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,970
Yes, sir.

76
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,429
Major Kong,
message from base confirmed.

77
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:47,347
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

78
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:51,507
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe
with the Ruskies.

79
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:10,613
Boys, I ain't much of a hand
at making speeches.

80
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:15,155
But I got a fair idea
that something doggone important...

81
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:17,133
is going on back there.

82
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,917
I've got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions...

83
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:24,300
that some of you fellows
may be thinking.

84
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,995
Heck, I reckon you wouldn't be
human beings...

85
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:31,473
if you didn't have pretty strong
personal feelings about nuclear combat.

86
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:34,360
I want you to remember one thing.

87
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,074
The folks back home
are counting on you.

88
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:39,382
And by golly,
we ain't about to let them down.

89
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:43,348
Tell you something else.

90
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:48,206
If this thing turns out to be half
as important as I figure it might be...

91
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:52,143
I'd say you're all in line
for some important promotions...

92
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:55,862
and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

93
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,582
That goes for every last one of you...

94
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:02,328
regardless of your race,
color or your creed.

95
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,809
Now let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.

96
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,014
Buck, should I get it?

97
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,939
Yeah, you'll have to.

98
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:30,326
Hello?

99
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:34,803
Yes, General Turgidson is here,
but he can't come to the phone now.

100
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:37,046
This is his secretary, Miss Scott.

101
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:40,243
Freddie, how are you?

102
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,487
Fine. And you?

103
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:47,029
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

104
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,541
He's tied up.
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.

105
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:53,948
Just a minute.

106
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:57,143
General Turgidson,
a Colonel Puntrich calling.

107
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:59,067
Tell him to call back.

108
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:03,638
Freddie, the general says
could you call back in a minute?

109
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,563
He says it can't wait.

110
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:08,825
For Pete's...
Find out what he wants.

111
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:12,636
The general is in the powder room
right now.

112
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,872
Could you tell me what it's about?

113
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:20,183
Just a second. Apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago...

114
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:22,644
from Burpelson Air Force Base.

115
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:29,269
Right. It was directed to
the 843rd Bomb Wing on airborne alert.

116
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:34,290
It decoded as Wing attack Plan R.

117
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:39,801
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
Base Commander Ripper.

118
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:41,463
Do I have to think of everything?

119
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:45,943
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.

120
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,277
Oh. All communications are dead!

121
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:52,603
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

122
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:57,405
The general asks if you could
possibly try again yourself.

123
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,943
I see. He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

124
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,665
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

125
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,365
Fred? Buck.
What's it look like?

126
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:17,277
Yeah?

127
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:21,525
Well, are you sure it's Plan R?

128
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,306
Huh. What's cooking
on the threat board?

129
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,059
Nothing? Nothing at all?

130
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,119
I don't like the look of this.

131
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:36,057
Tell you what you better do,
old buddy.

132
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:39,162
You better give Elmo and Charlie a blast
and bump everything up to condition red.

133
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:41,689
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.

134
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:43,865
- What's up?
- Nothing.

135
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,540
- Where's my shorts?
- On the floor. Where are you going?

136
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,299
No place.

137
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:54,909
I thought I might mosey over to the
War Room to see what's doing over there.

138
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:56,701
It's 3:00 in the morning.

139
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,624
The air force never sleeps.

140
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,465
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.

141
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,709
I know how it is, baby.

142
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,719
Tell you what you do.

143
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,518
You start your countdown
and old Bucky will be back...

144
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:18,009
before you can say <i>Blastoff</i>!

145
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,162
Your Commie has no regard
for human life, not even his own.

146
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,967
For this reason, men, I want
to impress upon you the need...

147
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,042
for extreme watchfulness.

148
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:33,977
The enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength.

149
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:36,538
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

150
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:39,961
But however he comes,
we must stop him.

151
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:42,685
We must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base.

152
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:47,938
Now, I am going to give you
three simple rules.

153
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:52,313
First: Trust no one,
whatever his uniform or rank...

154
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:54,777
unless he is known to you personally.

155
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,602
Secondly: Anyone or anything...

156
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:02,369
that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon.

157
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:07,837
Third: If in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

158
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,136
I would sooner accept a few casualties
through accident...

159
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:15,164
than lose the entire base
and its personnel through carelessness.

160
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:19,197
Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.

161
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:22,946
Now, men, in conclusion...

162
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:26,908
I would like to say
that in the two years...

163
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:30,624
that it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer...

164
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:33,507
I have always expected
the best from you...

165
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:37,315
and you have never given me
anything less than that.

166
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:40,610
Today the nation is counting on us.

167
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:44,353
We are not going to let them down.

168
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,276
Good luck to you all.

169
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,661
Here's the attack profile, sir.

170
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,849
This is your attack profile.

171
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,886
<i>To ensure that the enemy cannot monitor
voice transmission...</i>

172
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,031
or plant false transmission...

173
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:57,024
the C.R.M. 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

174
00:16:57,095 --> 00:17:00,412
The emergency base code prefix
is to be set...

175
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,790
on the dials of the C.R.M.

176
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:07,232
<i>This will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix.</i>

177
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:10,817
Stand by to set code prefix.

178
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:13,256
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

179
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:15,109
<i>Set code prefix.</i>

180
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,640
Code prefix set.

181
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:27,299
<i>Lock code prefix.</i>

182
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:31,240
Code prefix locked.

183
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:34,655
<i>Switch all receiver circuits
to C.R.M. discriminators.</i>

184
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:38,917
Switched to C.R.M. discriminators.

185
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:40,776
<i>Check auto destruct circuits.</i>

186
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,801
Auto destruct circuits checked.

187
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:55,209
<i>Primary target:
the I.C.B.M. complex at Laputa.</i>

188
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:59,333
Target reference:
Yankee, golf, tango...

189
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:01,377
3-6-0.

190
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,306
Thirty megaton nuclear device...

191
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:07,300
fused for air burst at 10,000 feet.

192
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:11,680
Twenty megaton nuclear device
will be used if first malfunctions.

193
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:14,307
Otherwise, proceed to secondary target:

194
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:18,241
missile complex seven miles east
of Borchov.

195
00:18:18,316 --> 00:18:22,113
Target reference:
November, bravo, x-ray...

196
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,554
1-0-8.

197
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,706
<i>Fused air burst at 10...</i>
Check...<i>12,000 feet.</i>

198
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:44,298
Excuse me, sir. Something rather
interesting has just cropped up.

199
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:47,080
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

200
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:52,712
I think the Pentagon has given us
an exercise to check our readiness.

201
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,691
I think it's taking things too far.

202
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:57,667
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in about 20 minutes.

203
00:18:57,741 --> 00:19:00,841
Listen. Chock full of stations
all churning it out.

204
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,230
- Mandrake?
- Yes, sir?

205
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,596
I issued instructions for all radios
to be impounded.

206
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:11,786
You did, and I was in the process of
impounding this when I switched it on.

207
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:15,202
I thought our fellows hitting Russian
radar, dropping all their stuff...

208
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:19,555
I'd better tell you because if they do,
it'll cause a stink.

209
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,525
Group Captain,
the officer exchange program...

210
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,079
does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders.

211
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,208
I realize that, sir, but I thought
you'd be pleased to hear the news.

212
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:33,929
After all, let's face it.

213
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:37,828
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we have to, do we?

214
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:42,280
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.

215
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:43,430
Yes, sir.

216
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:48,205
What about the planes? Surely we must
issue the recall code immediately.

217
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,021
The planes are not going
to be recalled.

218
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,838
My attack orders have been issued,
and the orders stand.

219
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,784
If you'll excuse me for saying so,
that would be to my way of thinking...

220
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:01,927
rather an odd way of looking at it

221
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:04,301
If a Russian attack was in progress...

222
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:08,143
we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

223
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,958
- Are you certain?
- I'm absolutely positive.

224
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:13,643
What if it is true?

225
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,614
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because I mean...

226
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:20,398
if a Russian attack
was not in progress...

227
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:24,653
then your use of Plan R... in fact,
your orders to the entire Wing...

228
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:36,876
I would say, sir, that there was
something dreadfully wrong somewhere

229
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,174
Why don't you take it easy,
Group Captain?

230
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:42,794
Please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater...

231
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:45,201
and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

232
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:57,801
General Ripper, sir, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force...

233
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:01,006
it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances...

234
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:05,580
to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the Wing.

235
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,560
If you'll excuse me, sir.

236
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:20,529
Sir, I must ask you for the key and the
recall code. Have you got them handy?

237
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,983
I told you to take it easy,
Group Captain.

238
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:25,513
There's nothing anybody can do now.

239
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,920
I'm the only person who knows
the three-letter code group.

240
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,442
I must insist
that you give them to me!

241
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:42,984
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

242
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,133
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you...

243
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:52,651
that while we're chatting here
so enjoyably...

244
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:56,433
a decision is being made
by the president...

245
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:59,535
and the joint chiefs in the War Room
at the Pentagon.

246
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:05,933
When they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the Wing...

247
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:10,128
there will be only one course
of action open.

248
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,017
Total commitment.

249
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:18,451
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

250
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,286
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.

251
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:26,795
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

252
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,238
When he said that 50 years ago...

253
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,196
he might have been right.

254
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,530
But today...

255
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:39,913
war is too important
to be left to politicians.

256
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:44,268
They have neither the time,
the training...

257
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:47,277
nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

258
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:54,123
I can no longer sit back
and allow...

259
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:59,153
Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...

260
00:22:59,223 --> 00:23:00,782
Communist subversion...

261
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:05,908
and the international
Communist conspiracy...

262
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:08,724
to sap and impurify...

263
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,987
all of our precious
bodily fluids.

264
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:19,340
Staines, is everybody here?

265
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:21,804
Mr. President, the secretary of state
is in Vietnam.

266
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,677
The secretary of defense is in Laos, and
the vice president is in Mexico City.

267
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:30,507
We can establish contact with them at
anytime. The undersecretaries are here.

268
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:33,551
Right. General Turgidson,
what's going on?

269
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:37,486
Mr. President...

270
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,072
about 35 minutes ago...

271
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:44,974
General Jack Ripper,
the commanding general...

272
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,383
of Burpelson Air Force Base...

273
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:50,581
issued an order to the 34 B-52s
of his Wing...

274
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:52,689
which were airborne at the time...

275
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:56,721
as part of a special exercise we were
holding called Operation Dropkick.

276
00:23:56,792 --> 00:24:01,299
It appears that the order
called for the planes...

277
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:04,597
to attack their targets
inside Russia.

278
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:08,724
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons...

279
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:12,176
with an average load
of 40 megatons each.

280
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,528
The central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

281
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:21,043
The triangles
are their primary targets.

282
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:23,928
The squares
are their secondary targets.

283
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:30,039
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

284
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:35,318
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

285
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:40,438
I understood I was the only one
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

286
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,460
That's right, sir. You are
the only person authorized to do so.

287
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:49,654
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in...

288
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:53,203
it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

289
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:57,944
It certainly does, far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

290
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,491
Perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

291
00:25:01,563 --> 00:25:03,320
Plan R?

292
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:08,084
Plan R is an emergency war plan...

293
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,578
in which a lower echelon commander
may order...

294
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:13,650
nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack...

295
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:17,071
if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

296
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:19,930
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

297
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:25,081
Surely you must recall, sir,
when Senator Beaufort made...

298
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,995
that big hassle about our deterrent
lacking credibility.

299
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:32,600
The idea was for Plan R to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

300
00:25:32,668 --> 00:25:34,579
A safeguard?

301
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:37,785
I admit the human element seems
to have failed us here.

302
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:41,114
But the idea was to discourage
the Ruskies from any hope...

303
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,588
they could knock out Washington, and
yourself, as part of a sneak attack...

304
00:25:45,661 --> 00:25:49,687
and escape retaliation because of lack
of proper command and control.

305
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,343
I assume the planes will return
automatically...

306
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:54,356
once they reach their fail-safe points.

307
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:59,765
I'm afraid not. The planes were holding
at their fail-safe points...

308
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:01,780
when the go code was issued.

309
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:06,163
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do
not require a second order to proceed.

310
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:08,092
They will continue
until they reach their target.

311
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:11,092
Then why haven't you radioed the planes,
countermanding the go code?

312
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:15,603
We're unable to communicate
with any of the aircraft.

313
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:17,783
Why?

314
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:20,156
As you may recall, sir...

315
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:23,703
one of the provisions
of Plan R provides...

316
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:28,183
that once the go code
is received...

317
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:31,451
the normal S.S.B. radios
in the aircraft...

318
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,885
are switched into
a special coded device...

319
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:36,886
which I believe is designated
as C.R.M. 114.

320
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:41,214
In order to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake or confusing orders...

321
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,054
C.R.M. 114 is designed
not to receive at all...

322
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,422
unless the message is proceeded by the
correct three-letter code group prefix.

323
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:55,646
You mean to tell me you will be unable
to recall the aircraft?

324
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:58,527
That's the size of it.
However, we are plowing through...

325
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:01,373
every possible three-letter combination
of the code.

326
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,426
But since there are
17,000 permutations...

327
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:09,943
it's going to take us about two
and a half days to transmit them all.

328
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:12,667
How soon will the planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?

329
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:16,085
- About 18 minutes from now.
- Are you in contact with General Ripper?

330
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,864
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications.

331
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,490
Where did you get this information?

332
00:27:22,562 --> 00:27:26,008
General Ripper called
Strategic Air Command Headquarters...

333
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,502
shortly after he issued the go code.

334
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:32,056
I have a portion of the conversation
transcript if you'd like me to read it.

335
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,820
Read it.

336
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,204
The duty officer asked
General Ripper...

337
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:41,405
to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said:

338
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,493
<i>Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back.</i>

339
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:49,247
For the sake of our country
and our way of life...

340
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:51,899
I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

341
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:56,671
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed
by Red retaliation.

342
00:27:56,737 --> 00:28:01,822
My boys will give you the best kind
of start: 1,400 megatons worth.

343
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,306
And you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

344
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:08,128
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

345
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:12,864
God willing, we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear...

346
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:16,193
and in true health
through the purity...

347
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,967
and essence of our natural...

348
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:21,408
fluids.

349
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:24,280
<i>God bless you all.</i>

350
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:28,667
Then he hung up.

351
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:32,187
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase, sir.

352
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:36,417
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.

353
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:41,373
I'd like to hold off judgment
until all the facts are in.

354
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:45,850
General Turgidson, when you instituted
the human reliability tests...

355
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,698
you assured me there was no possibility
of such a thing ever occurring.

356
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:55,483
Well, I don't think it's fair
to condemn a whole program...

357
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:58,109
because of a single slip-up, sir.

358
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,602
I want to speak to General Ripper
on the telephone.

359
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:02,138
That's impossible.

360
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:05,955
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested...

361
00:29:06,021 --> 00:29:09,436
in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

362
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,938
General Faceman.

363
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:13,117
Yes, sir?

364
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:15,457
Are there any army units
stationed near Burpelson?

365
00:29:15,524 --> 00:29:17,499
I'll just check, sir.

366
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,524
Hello?

367
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,129
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

368
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:32,991
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.

369
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,519
My president needs me.

370
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,070
Of course Bucky would rather
be there with you.

371
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:43,135
Of course it isn't only physical.

372
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:45,573
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

373
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:48,605
Someday I'm going to make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

374
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:52,550
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.

375
00:29:52,615 --> 00:29:55,463
Bucky will be there as soon as he can.

376
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:59,935
Alright. Listen, don't forget
to say your prayers.

377
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:10,438
Apparently,
the 23rd Airborne Division...

378
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:13,220
is stationed seven miles away
at Alvarado.

379
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:17,379
General Faceman, I want them to enter
the base, locate General Ripper...

380
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:19,716
and put him in immediate
telephone contact with me.

381
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:21,344
Yes, sir.

382
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,009
Mr. President?

383
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,608
If I may advise.

384
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,772
Under a condition red, it is standard
procedure that the base be sealed off...

385
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:31,490
and the base defended
by base security troops.

386
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:35,815
Any force trying to enter would
certainly encounter heavy casualties.

387
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:39,775
General Turgidson, with all due respect
for your defense team...

388
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:42,467
my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble.

389
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:47,940
Mr. President, there are one or two
points I'd like to make, if I may?

390
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:50,312
Go ahead, General.

391
00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:56,227
One: Our hopes for recalling
the 843rd Bomb Wing...

392
00:30:56,298 --> 00:31:00,420
are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

393
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:03,392
Two: In less than 15 minutes
from now...

394
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:06,335
the Ruskies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

395
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:08,319
Three: When they do...

396
00:31:08,394 --> 00:31:11,874
they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they've got.

397
00:31:11,946 --> 00:31:15,689
Four: If prior to this time...

398
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:19,070
we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities...

399
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:22,660
we will suffer virtual annihilation.

400
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:30,082
Five: If, on the other hand...

401
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:36,999
we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases...

402
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:40,134
we'd stand a damn good chance
of catching them with their pants down.

403
00:31:40,204 --> 00:31:42,473
Hell, we've got
a five-to-one missile superiority.

404
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,190
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target...

405
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:48,521
and still have a very effective reserve
force for any other contingency.

406
00:31:48,588 --> 00:31:53,737
Six: An unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality...

407
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:58,538
indicated that we would destroy
90% of their nuclear capabilities.

408
00:31:58,603 --> 00:32:00,643
We would therefore prevail...

409
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:03,782
and suffer only modest and acceptable
civilian casualties...

410
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:08,107
from their remaining force which would
be badly damaged and uncoordinated.

411
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:11,489
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country...

412
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:13,638
never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

413
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:18,213
Well, Mr. President, General Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

414
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:22,539
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.

415
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:28,138
Mr. President, we are rapidly
approaching a moment of truth...

416
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:31,239
both for ourselves as human beings
and for the life of our nation.

417
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,829
Truth is not always a pleasant thing.

418
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:36,356
But it is necessary now
to make a choice:

419
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:39,080
to choose between two admittedly
regrettable...

420
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:42,467
but nevertheless distinguishable
postwar environments.

421
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:47,145
One, where 20 million people are killed;
the other, 150 people killed.

422
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:50,061
You're talking about mass murder,
General, not war.

423
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:53,573
Mr. President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

424
00:32:53,645 --> 00:32:58,086
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed. Tops!

425
00:32:58,158 --> 00:33:00,068
Depending on the breaks.

426
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:03,972
I will not go down in history as
the greatest mass murderer since Hitler!

427
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:06,534
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

428
00:33:06,607 --> 00:33:09,804
with the American people than
with your image in the history books.

429
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:12,772
General Turgidson,
I've heard quite sufficient from you.

430
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:15,148
Thank you very much.

431
00:33:15,214 --> 00:33:17,669
Mr. President, they have
the ambassador waiting upstairs.

432
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:21,223
- Good. Any difficulty?
- He's having a fit about the M.P.s.

433
00:33:21,294 --> 00:33:23,662
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here straightaway.

434
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:25,222
Yes, sir.

435
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:27,716
Is that the Russian ambassador?

436
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,799
Yes, it is, General.

437
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:34,671
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador...

438
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:37,003
is to be admitted entrance
to the War Room?

439
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:39,821
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

440
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:44,712
I don't know exactly how
to put this, sir...

441
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:48,079
but are you aware of what a breach
of security that would be?

442
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:52,138
He'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

443
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,277
That is precisely the idea, General.

444
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:57,484
That is precisely the idea.

445
00:33:58,961 --> 00:34:02,703
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

446
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:13,295
<i>Survival kit contents check.</i>

447
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,095
In them you will find
one.45 caliber automatic...

448
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:20,551
two boxes of ammunition...

449
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,757
four days concentrated
emergency rations...

450
00:34:23,825 --> 00:34:27,022
one drug issue
containing antibiotics...

451
00:34:27,091 --> 00:34:31,245
morphine, vitamin pills,
pep pills...

452
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:34,957
sleeping pills,
tranquilizer pills...

453
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:39,663
one miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible...

454
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:42,633
$ 100 in rubles...

455
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,747
$ 100 in gold...

456
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:47,469
nine packs of chewing gum...

457
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:49,393
one issue of prophylactics...

458
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:53,321
<i>three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings.</i>

459
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:57,933
Shoot, a fellow could have a pretty
good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.

460
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:05,969
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

461
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:08,140
- Your eggs are fresh?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:12,009
I will have poached eggs. And bring me
some cigars, please. Havana cigars.

463
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:15,345
That will be all, sir?
I'll see to it right away.

464
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:18,478
Try one of these Jamaican cigars,
Ambassador. They're good.

465
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:21,865
Thank you, no. I do not support the work
of imperialist stooges.

466
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:24,427
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?

467
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,993
Mr. President.

468
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,959
You're gonna let that lousy Commie punk
vomit all over us like this?

469
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:32,075
Mr. President?

470
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:35,759
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is...

471
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:38,129
and he won't be back for two hours.

472
00:35:39,157 --> 00:35:41,546
Try B-8-6-5-4-3 Moscow.

473
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:43,629
You would never have found him
through his office.

474
00:35:43,702 --> 00:35:47,564
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow.

475
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:50,221
- Degenerate atheistic Commie.
- What did you say?

476
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:53,708
I said Premier Kissoff is
a degenerate atheistic Commie!

477
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:56,596
- Have this ignorant fool...
- I'm sorry!

478
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,436
Mr. President,
I think they're trying the number.

479
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:13,645
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the War Room!

480
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:16,433
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

481
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,592
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

482
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:23,149
You bet your sweets, Mr. Commie!
Look at this, Mr. President.

483
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:26,670
This lousy Commie rat was taking
pictures with this of the big board!

484
00:36:27,703 --> 00:36:29,491
Mr. Ambassador!

485
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:33,650
This clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

486
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,469
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.

487
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:40,561
This is outrageous. I have never heard
of such behavior in the War Room before.

488
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,019
Mr. President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

489
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,734
You got to hand it to those Commies.

490
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,142
Yeah. Those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

491
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:18,071
I wonder where they got them from.

492
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,308
Probably bought them
from the army as war surplus.

493
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:27,759
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

494
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:26,164
Tell him where you are and that
you'll speak if I say anything untrue...

495
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:28,439
but nothing more than that.

496
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:33,240
Alexi? Alexi, please.
I beg you.

497
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:36,755
But I don't have a phone.

498
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:39,283
Give him the phone.

499
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:09,178
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.

500
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,339
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?

501
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:18,716
Listen, I can't hear too well.

502
00:39:18,782 --> 00:39:21,911
Could you turn the music down
a little?

503
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,835
That's much better.

504
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,421
Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:30,328
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.

506
00:39:30,396 --> 00:39:33,746
Clear and plain
and coming through fine.

507
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:38,044
I'm coming through fine, too, eh?
Good.

508
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,906
Well, then, as you say,
we're both coming through fine. Good.

509
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:43,838
It's good that you're fine...

510
00:39:43,902 --> 00:39:46,075
and I'm fine.

511
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:49,239
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

512
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:52,215
Now, Dimitri...

513
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:57,753
you know how we've always talked
about the possibility...

514
00:39:57,822 --> 00:40:00,408
of something going wrong
with the bomb.

515
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:03,614
The bomb, Dimitri.

516
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:07,288
The hydrogen bomb.

517
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,206
Well, now, what happened is...

518
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:14,331
one of our base commanders,
he had a sort of...

519
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:17,496
Well, he went a little funny
in the head.

520
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:20,534
You know, just a little funny.

521
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:24,087
And he went and did a silly thing.

522
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,974
I'll tell you what he did.

523
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,276
He ordered his planes...

524
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,247
to attack your country.

525
00:40:33,312 --> 00:40:35,614
Let me finish, Dimitri.

526
00:40:36,576 --> 00:40:38,464
Let me finish, Dimitri.

527
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:41,593
Listen, how do you think
I feel about it?

528
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:44,413
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?

529
00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:47,961
Why do you think I'm calling you?

530
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:49,975
Just to say hello?

531
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:53,310
Of course I like to speak to you!

532
00:40:53,377 --> 00:40:55,798
Of course I like to say hello!

533
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:57,978
Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.

534
00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:01,912
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

535
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:04,855
Of course, it's a friendly call.

536
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:09,019
Listen, if it wasn't friendly,
you probably wouldn't have even got it.

537
00:41:11,232 --> 00:41:15,804
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

538
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:18,841
I am positive, Dimitri.

539
00:41:18,913 --> 00:41:21,248
I've been all over this
with your ambassador.

540
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:23,703
It is not a trick.

541
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:25,186
I'll tell you.

542
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,928
We'd like to give your A ir Staff
a complete rundown on the targets...

543
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:32,127
the flight plans
and defensive systems of the planes.

544
00:41:32,196 --> 00:41:36,929
Yes, if we're unable
to recall the planes...

545
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,547
I'd say, well...

546
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:45,089
we're just gonna have to help you
destroy them, Dimitri.

547
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:47,970
I know they're our boys.

548
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:50,457
Listen. Now, who should we call?

549
00:41:52,227 --> 00:41:56,537
Who should we call?
Sorry, you faded away.

550
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,408
The Peoples Central
Air Defense Headquarters.

551
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:03,679
Where is that, Dimitri?

552
00:42:03,747 --> 00:42:05,787
In Omsk. Right.

553
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,029
Yes.

554
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,881
You'll call them first, will you?

555
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:15,138
Do you happen to have the phone number
on you, Dimitri?

556
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:19,801
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

557
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:25,758
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

558
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:29,505
Alright, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

559
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:33,888
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.

560
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:35,844
Don't say that you're more sorry
than I am...

561
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:38,724
because I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

562
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,644
So we're both sorry, alright?

563
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:42,083
Alright.

564
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:47,360
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

565
00:42:59,397 --> 00:43:01,023
What?

566
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:21,699
What? What is it? What?

567
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,668
The fools. The mad fools.

568
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:28,095
What's happened?

569
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,403
The doomsday machine.

570
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:32,927
The doomsday machine?
What is that?

571
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:38,182
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

572
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,419
All human and animal life?

573
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:56,868
- Mandrake?
- Yes, Jack?

574
00:43:58,121 --> 00:44:01,568
Have you ever seen a Commie
drink a glass of water?

575
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,016
Well, I can't say I have, Jack.

576
00:44:07,176 --> 00:44:11,847
Vodka. That's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

577
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:16,135
I believe that's what they drink, yes.

578
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:19,517
On no account will a Commie
ever drink water...

579
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:21,829
and not without good reason.

580
00:44:22,857 --> 00:44:25,410
Oh, yes.

581
00:44:25,481 --> 00:44:30,337
I can't quite see
what you're getting at.

582
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:34,499
Water. That's what I'm getting at.
Water.

583
00:44:35,978 --> 00:44:39,294
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

584
00:44:40,776 --> 00:44:44,224
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface
is water.

585
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:47,495
Why, do you realize that...

586
00:44:47,562 --> 00:44:50,497
70% of you is water?

587
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:51,944
Good Lord.

588
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,932
And as human beings,
you and I need fresh, pure water...

589
00:44:57,003 --> 00:45:00,450
to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

590
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:03,142
- You beginning to understand?
- Yes.

591
00:45:10,186 --> 00:45:15,237
Have you never wondered why I drink
only distilled water...

592
00:45:15,306 --> 00:45:19,530
or rainwater,
and only pure grain alcohol?

593
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:22,759
It did occur to me, Jack, yes.

594
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:27,617
Have you ever heard of fluoridation
of water?

595
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:32,330
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.

596
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,250
Do you know what it is?

597
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,315
No, no, I don't know what it is.

598
00:45:37,387 --> 00:45:41,162
Do you realize that fluoridation...

599
00:45:41,227 --> 00:45:43,945
is the most monstrously conceived...

600
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:46,695
and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

601
00:45:52,845 --> 00:45:54,732
Two can play at that game, soldier.

602
00:45:59,629 --> 00:46:02,247
That's nice shooting, soldier!

603
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:27,684
Mandrake, come here.

604
00:46:27,757 --> 00:46:29,699
You calling me, Jack?

605
00:46:29,773 --> 00:46:32,108
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

606
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:37,891
I haven't had very much experience...

607
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:40,650
with those sort of machines.

608
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,363
I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

609
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:47,912
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed me this belt.

610
00:46:47,984 --> 00:46:52,556
Jack, I'd love to come,
but what's happened, you see...

611
00:46:52,624 --> 00:46:55,305
the string in my leg is gone.

612
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:59,978
- The what?
- The string. I never told you.

613
00:47:00,047 --> 00:47:03,790
I've got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone. Shot off.

614
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:09,352
Mandrake, come over here.
The redcoats are coming.

615
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:14,410
When it is detonated, it will produce
enough radioactive fallout...

616
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,334
so that in ten months...

617
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,366
the surface of the Earth
will be as dead as the moon!

618
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:22,286
Come on, De Sadesky!
That's ridiculous!

619
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:26,313
Our studies show even the worst fallout
is down to a safe level after two weeks.

620
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:31,206
- You never heard of cobalt thorium G.
- What about it?

621
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,208
Cobalt thorium G has
a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

622
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,249
If you take 50 H bombs
in the 100 megaton range...

623
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:40,623
and jacket them
with cobalt thorium G...

624
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:45,131
when they are exploded,
they will produce a doomsday shroud...

625
00:47:45,202 --> 00:47:47,404
a lethal cloud of radioactivity...

626
00:47:47,472 --> 00:47:51,728
which will encircle the Earth
for 93 years!

627
00:47:51,793 --> 00:47:55,208
What a load of Commie bull.
I mean, after all.

628
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:58,794
I'm afraid I don't understand
something, Alexi.

629
00:47:58,865 --> 00:48:02,346
Is the premier threatening to explode it
if our planes carry out their attack?

630
00:48:02,418 --> 00:48:04,873
No, sir. It is not a thing
a sane man would do.

631
00:48:04,946 --> 00:48:07,762
The doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically.

632
00:48:07,827 --> 00:48:09,998
Surely you can disarm it somehow.

633
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:13,839
It is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to un-trigger it.

634
00:48:13,905 --> 00:48:15,115
Automatically?

635
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:17,673
It's a Commie trick!
We're wasting valuable time!

636
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:20,713
Look at the big board!
They're getting ready to clobber us!

637
00:48:20,786 --> 00:48:25,259
This is absolute madness.
Why should you build such a thing?

638
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,218
There are those of us
who fought against it.

639
00:48:27,283 --> 00:48:29,258
But in the end, we could not keep up
with the expense involved...

640
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:33,674
in the arms race, the space race
and the peace race.

641
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:38,767
At the same time, our people grumbled
for more nylons and washing machines.

642
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:41,289
Our doomsday scheme cost us
just a small fraction...

643
00:48:41,362 --> 00:48:44,462
of what we have been spending on defense
in a single year.

644
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:48,786
The deciding factor was when we learned
your country was working similarly...

645
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:50,707
and we were afraid of a doomsday gap!

646
00:48:50,771 --> 00:48:54,001
This is preposterous! I've never
approved of anything like that.

647
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:56,785
Our source was The New York Times.

648
00:48:56,852 --> 00:49:00,595
Dr. Strangelove, do we have anything
like that in the works?

649
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,027
A moment, please, Mr. President.

650
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,947
Under the authority granted me...

651
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:13,005
as director of weapons research
and development...

652
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:17,102
I commissioned last year
a study of this project...

653
00:49:17,172 --> 00:49:19,311
by the Bland Corporation.

654
00:49:19,381 --> 00:49:22,414
Based on the findings of the report...

655
00:49:22,485 --> 00:49:27,755
my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent...

656
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:31,506
for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious.

657
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:34,834
You mean it is possible for them
to have built such a thing?

658
00:49:38,837 --> 00:49:43,507
Mr. President, the technology required
is easily within the means...

659
00:49:43,573 --> 00:49:47,797
of even the smallest nuclear power.

660
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:51,659
It requires only the will to do so.

661
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:56,340
But how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically...

662
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:58,642
and at the same time
impossible to un-trigger?

663
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:02,572
Mr. President,
it is not only possible...

664
00:50:02,646 --> 00:50:04,501
it is essential.

665
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:08,821
That is the whole idea
of this machine, you know.

666
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:13,873
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy...

667
00:50:13,943 --> 00:50:16,431
the fear of attack.

668
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:21,239
And so because of the automated and
irrevocable decision-making process...

669
00:50:21,303 --> 00:50:25,043
which rules out human meddling...

670
00:50:25,111 --> 00:50:28,908
the doomsday machine is terrifying...

671
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:30,990
and simple to understand...

672
00:50:31,063 --> 00:50:34,609
and completely credible
and convincing.

673
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:37,876
I wish we had one of them
doomsday machines.

674
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:41,391
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.
How can it be triggered automatically?

675
00:50:41,464 --> 00:50:45,110
It's remarkably simple to do that.

676
00:50:45,177 --> 00:50:48,559
When you merely wish to bury bombs...

677
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:50,869
there's no limit to the size.

678
00:50:50,938 --> 00:50:53,074
After that, they are connected...

679
00:50:53,143 --> 00:50:57,006
to a gigantic complex of computers.

680
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,579
Now then, a specific and clearly
defined set of circumstances...

681
00:51:02,648 --> 00:51:05,965
under which the bombs
are to be exploded...

682
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:09,904
is programmed into a tape memory bank.

683
00:51:09,978 --> 00:51:12,945
Hmm. Strangelove?

684
00:51:13,978 --> 00:51:16,913
What kind of a name is that?
That ain't no Kraut name, is it?

685
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:19,188
He changed it when he became a citizen.

686
00:51:19,256 --> 00:51:22,125
It used to be Merkwurdichliebe.

687
00:51:22,201 --> 00:51:26,391
Well, a Kraut by any other name,
uh, Stainsey?

688
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:32,408
The whole point of
the doomsday machine...

689
00:51:32,474 --> 00:51:35,888
is lost if you keep it a secret!

690
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:38,035
Why didn't you tell the world?

691
00:51:38,107 --> 00:51:42,330
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

692
00:51:42,395 --> 00:51:45,589
As you know,
the premier loves surprises.

693
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:34,232
Stay with me, Mandrake.

694
00:52:39,195 --> 00:52:41,781
Alright, now feed me.
Feed me, boy.

695
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:15,285
Don't you think we'd be better off
away from this flying glass?

696
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:17,332
We're okay here.

697
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:22,772
Mandrake, do you realize that
in addition to fluoridating the water...

698
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:26,262
there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt, flour...

699
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:31,155
fruit juices, soup, sugar,
milk, ice cream?

700
00:53:31,229 --> 00:53:32,440
Ice cream.

701
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,845
- Children's ice cream.
- Good Lord.

702
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:37,245
You know when fluoridation
first began?

703
00:53:38,238 --> 00:53:40,092
No, I don't, Jack.

704
00:53:40,158 --> 00:53:42,525
1946.

705
00:53:42,591 --> 00:53:45,241
1946, Mandrake.

706
00:53:45,311 --> 00:53:49,435
How does that coincide with
your postwar Commie conspiracy, huh?

707
00:53:49,504 --> 00:53:52,669
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

708
00:53:52,737 --> 00:53:58,038
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids...

709
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,242
without the knowledge
of the individual.

710
00:54:01,311 --> 00:54:03,166
Certainly without any choice.

711
00:54:04,895 --> 00:54:08,060
That's the way a hard-core Commie works.

712
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,539
Jack. Tell me, Jack.

713
00:54:12,608 --> 00:54:15,161
When did you first become...

714
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:17,883
Well, develop this theory?

715
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:21,084
Well, I...

716
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:24,566
I first became aware of it, Mandrake...

717
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,549
during the physical act of love.

718
00:54:28,256 --> 00:54:32,348
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue...

719
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:34,871
feeling of emptiness followed.

720
00:54:34,944 --> 00:54:38,557
Luckily I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

721
00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:41,466
Loss of essence.

722
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:46,620
I can assure you it has not recurred,
Mandrake.

723
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:49,506
Women sense my power...

724
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,730
and they seek the life essence.

725
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:57,150
I do not avoid women, Mandrake.

726
00:54:57,217 --> 00:54:59,999
But I do deny them my essence.

727
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:02,815
Yes, yes, Jack.

728
00:55:14,948 --> 00:55:16,986
Cease fire!

729
00:55:37,413 --> 00:55:39,037
My boys must have surrendered.

730
00:55:39,107 --> 00:55:41,345
There it is.

731
00:55:41,413 --> 00:55:43,169
Jack, listen.

732
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:46,432
While there's still time, I beg you,
let's recall the Wing and...

733
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:51,201
Those boys were like my children.

734
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:54,683
Now they let me down.

735
00:55:54,757 --> 00:55:56,382
No, not a bit.

736
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:59,136
I'm sure they all gave it
their very best.

737
00:55:59,205 --> 00:56:01,594
I'm equally sure they all died
thinking of you...

738
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:04,287
every man jack of them, Jack.

739
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:06,911
Supposing a bit of water
has gone off, eh?

740
00:56:06,982 --> 00:56:09,186
Certainly one can never be too sure
about those things.

741
00:56:09,254 --> 00:56:12,100
But look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

742
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:14,848
Look at me, Jack. Look.

743
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:18,845
And I drink a lot of water.
I'm what you might call a water man.

744
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:22,146
And I can swear to you, my boy,
swear to you...

745
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,384
that there's nothing wrong
with my bodily fluids.

746
00:56:24,453 --> 00:56:26,843
Not a thing, Jackie.

747
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,122
Mandrake, were you ever
a prisoner of war?

748
00:56:29,189 --> 00:56:32,703
Well, Jack, the time's running very...

749
00:56:32,774 --> 00:56:35,709
- What?
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?

750
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:37,789
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

751
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,828
Did they torture you?

752
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:43,803
Yes, they did.
I was tortured by the Japanese.

753
00:56:43,877 --> 00:56:45,470
Not a pretty story.

754
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:47,069
What happened?

755
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:51,267
I don't know, Jack. It's difficult
to think under these conditions.

756
00:56:51,335 --> 00:56:53,474
Well, what happened was...

757
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,805
they got me on the old
Rangoon-Inchinawa Railway.

758
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:01,061
I was laying train lines
for the bloody Japanese puff-puffs.

759
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:04,224
No, I mean, when they tortured you,
did you talk?

760
00:57:05,894 --> 00:57:07,805
No, I...

761
00:57:07,878 --> 00:57:11,970
Well, I don't think they wanted me
to talk, really, or say anything.

762
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:15,006
It was their way of having
a bit of fun, the swine.

763
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:18,276
The strange thing is,
they make such bloody good cameras.

764
00:57:19,944 --> 00:57:25,345
Those clowns outside will give me
a good going-over soon for the code.

765
00:57:28,232 --> 00:57:31,460
Yes, you may have quite a point
there, Jack.

766
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,389
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

767
00:57:35,464 --> 00:57:38,595
The answer to that is,
no one ever does.

768
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,625
And my advise to you
is to give me the code now.

769
00:57:42,696 --> 00:57:45,478
If those devils come back
and try any rough stuff...

770
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,676
we'll fight them together
like we did just now on the floor.

771
00:57:48,745 --> 00:57:52,128
You with your gun and me
with a belt of ammo, feeding you.

772
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:54,885
<i>Feed me,</i> you said,
and I was feeding you, Jack.

773
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:57,505
You know, Mandrake...

774
00:57:57,576 --> 00:58:00,675
I happen to believe in
a life after this one...

775
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:05,416
and I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

776
00:58:07,178 --> 00:58:08,584
And I think I can.

777
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,749
Yes, of course you can.
Of course you can. You can.

778
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:14,151
I'm a religious man myself,
you know.

779
00:58:14,218 --> 00:58:17,928
I believe in all that sort of thing
and I'm hoping, you know, Jack...

780
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,744
You've dropped your gun, Jack.

781
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:24,257
No, Jack, let me take that for you.

782
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:27,678
You know what I'm hoping? I'm hoping
you're going to give me the code, boy.

783
00:58:29,385 --> 00:58:31,906
You're going to wash and brush up?
What a good idea.

784
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:34,466
Always did wonders for a man,
a wash and brush up.

785
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:37,189
Water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvelous.

786
00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:39,910
That's what we need: water on
the back of the neck and the code.

787
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:43,428
Supposing I play a little guessing game
with you, Jack boy?

788
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:46,369
I'll try and guess
what the code is...

789
00:59:02,187 --> 00:59:06,497
Copilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.

790
00:59:06,571 --> 00:59:09,420
We have 109,000 total...

791
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:12,201
79,000 in the mains...

792
00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:14,952
and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.

793
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,874
And that works out
to roughly...

794
00:59:16,939 --> 00:59:20,255
seven hours, 15 minutes
endurance from this time.

795
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:22,730
D.S.O. to Captain.

796
00:59:22,795 --> 00:59:25,764
I have an unidentified
radar blip.

797
00:59:27,117 --> 00:59:29,605
Distance: 60 miles.

798
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,766
Approximate speed:
Mach three.

799
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:35,692
Looks like
a missile tracking us.

800
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:40,485
Confirmed:
definite missile track.

801
00:59:40,558 --> 00:59:42,530
Commence evasive action right.

802
00:59:48,525 --> 00:59:52,038
Missile still closing range.

803
00:59:52,109 --> 00:59:55,938
Distance: 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

804
00:59:56,013 --> 00:59:58,632
Lock E.C.M. to target intercept mode.

805
00:59:58,702 --> 01:00:02,183
E.C.M. locked to
target intercept mode.

806
01:00:02,254 --> 01:00:04,588
Missile still tracking
and closing distance.

807
01:00:04,655 --> 01:00:08,484
Range: 40 miles.
Continue evasive action.

808
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:15,368
Electronic Guidance Scrambler
to blue grid.

809
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:18,788
Missile still tracking steady
and closing distance.

810
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:20,717
Range: 30 miles.

811
01:00:22,895 --> 01:00:26,953
Missile still closing true and steady.
Continue evasive action.

812
01:00:34,192 --> 01:00:36,099
Range: 20 miles.

813
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,885
Missile still closing distance
and tracking steady.

814
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:42,284
Attack range gate
on maximum scan.

815
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:44,686
Range gate on maximum scan.

816
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,501
Range: 10 miles.

817
01:00:47,568 --> 01:00:51,365
Missile track deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

818
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,572
Deflection increasing.
Range: eight miles.

819
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,416
Deflection still increasing.
Range: six miles.

820
01:00:58,481 --> 01:01:01,067
Missile still deflecting.
Range: four miles.

821
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:09,706
Range: two miles.
Missile still deflecting.

822
01:01:09,776 --> 01:01:11,947
Range: one mile.
Missile detonated!

823
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,360
- Start lever to cut off!
- Cut off!

824
01:01:23,633 --> 01:01:25,008
We're losing power!

825
01:01:33,104 --> 01:01:35,341
Re-select essential power!

826
01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:37,351
Essential power re -selected.

827
01:01:43,698 --> 01:01:45,553
The hatch is stuck!

828
01:01:48,978 --> 01:01:50,354
Hit emergency power!

829
01:01:52,755 --> 01:01:55,471
- Extinguishers!
- Roger!

830
01:02:01,938 --> 01:02:05,070
- Transfer switches!
- Transferred!

831
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,309
- Boost pumps off!
- Cut off!

832
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,489
Fuel valves three, four and six!

833
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,874
Give me full power!

834
01:02:46,228 --> 01:02:48,715
Peace on Earth.

835
01:02:53,172 --> 01:02:55,758
P.O.E.

836
01:02:55,828 --> 01:02:58,578
Purity of Essence.

837
01:02:58,644 --> 01:03:02,027
O.P.O.E.

838
01:03:12,727 --> 01:03:14,961
Put your hands over your head.

839
01:03:15,029 --> 01:03:17,548
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?

840
01:03:17,621 --> 01:03:19,410
Put your hands over your head.

841
01:03:19,477 --> 01:03:22,925
What kind of suit
do you call that, fella?

842
01:03:22,998 --> 01:03:24,908
What do you mean, suit?

843
01:03:24,982 --> 01:03:27,315
This happens to be
an R.A.F. uniform...

844
01:03:27,382 --> 01:03:31,539
and I am Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,
General Ripper's executive officer.

845
01:03:31,606 --> 01:03:33,067
Where's General Ripper?

846
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,860
He's dead, in the bathroom.

847
01:03:35,927 --> 01:03:38,000
Where's the bathroom?

848
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:39,445
Next to you.

849
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:51,153
I don't know what stupid game
this is you're playing...

850
01:03:51,223 --> 01:03:53,263
but I've got a good idea
what the recall code is...

851
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:55,757
and I have to get in touch
with SAC headquarters immediately!

852
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,378
Put your hands over your head
and keep 'em there! Go on.

853
01:03:59,448 --> 01:04:01,072
Got any witnesses?

854
01:04:01,143 --> 01:04:02,999
What are you talking about?
He shot himself!

855
01:04:03,063 --> 01:04:05,007
While he was shaving?

856
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,112
Now look, Colonel Bat Guano...

857
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:10,549
if that really is your name...

858
01:04:10,615 --> 01:04:14,324
may I tell you that I have
a very good idea...

859
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:17,293
I think, hope, pray...
what the recall code is.

860
01:04:17,368 --> 01:04:19,987
It's some theme he kept repeating.
A variation on...

861
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:23,154
<i>Peace on Earth</i> or <i>Purity of Essence,</i>
one of those.

862
01:04:23,224 --> 01:04:26,902
Put your hands on top of your head.
Start walking.

863
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:30,069
Don't you know that General Ripper
went mad...

864
01:04:30,138 --> 01:04:33,399
and sent the whole Wing
to attack the Soviets?

865
01:04:33,466 --> 01:04:36,847
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

866
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,850
I'm going to pick up this red telephone,
which is connected to SAC...

867
01:04:40,921 --> 01:04:42,295
and I hope...

868
01:04:43,768 --> 01:04:45,842
Blast. Blast.

869
01:04:45,914 --> 01:04:49,743
Shot away, I expect, by one of your men
during this ridiculous fighting!

870
01:04:51,129 --> 01:04:53,071
Right.

871
01:04:53,145 --> 01:04:56,407
Alright, Charlie, I've been
wasting too much time on you.

872
01:04:56,474 --> 01:05:00,119
I got a lot of wounded men outside.
Start walking.

873
01:05:21,499 --> 01:05:25,176
All the radio gear is out,
including the C.R.M. 114.

874
01:05:25,243 --> 01:05:28,274
I think the auto-destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up.

875
01:05:32,602 --> 01:05:35,702
The fire is out.
The emergency power is on.

876
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:39,120
Everything checks out alright.
Will advise.

877
01:05:39,195 --> 01:05:40,853
Roger. Navigator?

878
01:05:40,923 --> 01:05:46,162
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 1-6-2 per minute.

879
01:05:46,236 --> 01:05:48,920
This gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out...

880
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:52,217
primary and secondary targets,
but we will not...

881
01:05:52,284 --> 01:05:56,276
repeat, not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country.

882
01:05:57,179 --> 01:05:59,634
However, we would have
enough fuel to ditch...

883
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:02,326
at weather ship Tango Delta...

884
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:05,527
grid coordinates 0-0-3-6-9-1.

885
01:06:10,108 --> 01:06:12,442
Well, boys,
we got three engines out.

886
01:06:12,509 --> 01:06:16,153
We got more holes in us
than a horse trader's mule.

887
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,162
The radio is gone,
and we're leaking fuel.

888
01:06:18,236 --> 01:06:21,531
And if we was flying any lower,
we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.

889
01:06:21,596 --> 01:06:24,466
But we got one little budge
on them Ruskies.

890
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,395
At this height
they might harpoon us...

891
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,429
but they sure ain't gonna spot us
on no radar screen.

892
01:06:40,158 --> 01:06:42,013
The other way.

893
01:06:42,078 --> 01:06:44,381
- Where are you taking me?
- To the main gate.

894
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:49,682
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here.

895
01:06:49,758 --> 01:06:51,613
- You wanna know what I think?
- Yes.

896
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:54,263
I think you're some kind
of deviated pervert.

897
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:56,952
I think General Ripper found out
about your perversion...

898
01:06:57,022 --> 01:06:59,226
and that you were organizing
some kind of mutiny of perverts.

899
01:06:59,294 --> 01:07:01,596
Now, move!

900
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:04,859
On top of that, I don't know anything
about any planes attacking Russia.

901
01:07:04,927 --> 01:07:08,571
I was told to get Ripper on the phone
with the President of the United States.

902
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:13,211
Now just one second.
You just said <i>the president.</i>

903
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,417
What about the president?

904
01:07:15,485 --> 01:07:18,520
The president wants to speak
to General Ripper, doesn't he?

905
01:07:18,591 --> 01:07:21,079
Now, General Ripper is dead,
is he not?

906
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,289
I am General Ripper's
executive officer...

907
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,208
so the president will want
to speak to me, won't he?

908
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:29,850
There's a telephone box over there
and the line may be open.

909
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,604
You wanna talk to
the President of the United States?

910
01:07:32,672 --> 01:07:35,422
I don't want to talk to him, Colonel,
I've got to talk to him.

911
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:39,002
And if you don't put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense...

912
01:07:39,073 --> 01:07:42,934
the Court of Inquiry on this
will give you such a pranging...

913
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:46,937
you'll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!

914
01:07:51,553 --> 01:07:55,033
Go ahead, try and get the President
of the United States on the phone.

915
01:07:57,602 --> 01:07:59,575
Try any perversions,
I'll blow your head off.

916
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,318
Operator? This is
Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

917
01:08:16,385 --> 01:08:18,359
I'm speaking from
Burpelson Air Force Base.

918
01:08:18,433 --> 01:08:22,176
Something urgent has come up and I want
you to place a person-to-person call...

919
01:08:22,242 --> 01:08:25,209
with President Merkin Muffley
in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

920
01:08:26,531 --> 01:08:29,596
Burpelson 3-9-1-8-0.

921
01:08:30,754 --> 01:08:35,608
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The President of the United States.

922
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,463
I'm sorry,
I haven't got enough change.

923
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:41,825
Could you make this
a collect call, Operator?

924
01:08:53,283 --> 01:08:56,765
Just one second, Operator.
They won't accept the call.

925
01:08:56,837 --> 01:08:58,659
Have you got 55 cents?

926
01:08:58,723 --> 01:09:01,623
Do you think I'd go into combat
with loose change in my pocket?

927
01:09:03,907 --> 01:09:06,689
Operator, look.

928
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:10,105
Is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call?

929
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,830
Well, what do you call it?
You know...

930
01:09:12,901 --> 01:09:15,769
Oh, station-to-station.

931
01:09:19,717 --> 01:09:23,065
Oh, blast!
I'm still 20 cents short.

932
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:28,162
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.

933
01:09:28,228 --> 01:09:32,220
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
I want you to shoot the lock off it.

934
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,267
There may be change in there.

935
01:09:37,668 --> 01:09:39,075
That's private property.

936
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,955
Can you possibly imagine
what is going to happen to you...

937
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:44,606
your frame outlook,
way of life and everything...

938
01:09:44,677 --> 01:09:49,021
when they learn you have obstructed
a phone call to the president?

939
01:09:49,094 --> 01:09:52,921
Can you imagine?
Shoot it off!

940
01:09:52,996 --> 01:09:56,477
Shoot with the gun! That's what
the bullets are for, you twit!

941
01:09:56,549 --> 01:09:59,865
Okay, I'm gonna get
your money for you.

942
01:09:59,941 --> 01:10:03,903
But if you don't get the president on
the phone, you know what's gonna happen?

943
01:10:03,974 --> 01:10:07,421
You're gonna have to answer
to the Coca-Cola Company.

944
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:19,173
This is SAC
Communications Control.

945
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:22,500
The recall code O.P.E...

946
01:10:22,566 --> 01:10:24,421
is being acknowledged <i>roger</i>...

947
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:29,189
by elements of
the 8-4-3 Bomb Wing.

948
01:10:29,254 --> 01:10:31,164
These are the details.

949
01:10:31,238 --> 01:10:35,614
Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38...

950
01:10:35,686 --> 01:10:39,102
are reported destroyed
by enemy action.

951
01:10:39,175 --> 01:10:43,583
All other missions have
acknowledged recall code.

952
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,512
This is SAC Communications Control.

953
01:10:45,576 --> 01:10:47,168
Over and out.

954
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:49,061
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

955
01:10:49,126 --> 01:10:51,428
Gentlemen.

956
01:10:51,495 --> 01:10:53,350
Mr. President.

957
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,423
I'm not a sentimentalist by nature...

958
01:10:55,495 --> 01:10:58,626
but I think I know what's
in every heart in this room.

959
01:10:58,695 --> 01:11:02,373
I think we all ought
to bow our heads...

960
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,416
and give a prayer of thanks
for our deliverance.

961
01:11:04,488 --> 01:11:05,863
Lord...

962
01:11:07,049 --> 01:11:11,457
we have heard the wings
of the Angel of Death...

963
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:14,278
fluttering over our heads
from the Valley of Fear.

964
01:11:14,343 --> 01:11:16,896
You have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil...

965
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:18,495
Excuse me, sir.

966
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:21,569
Premier Kissoff's calling again
and he's hopping mad.

967
01:11:28,041 --> 01:11:31,816
Fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased.

968
01:11:31,882 --> 01:11:35,744
Now works out at 2-0-5.

969
01:11:36,778 --> 01:11:38,687
Estimate remaining fuel...

970
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:42,503
at 8-7-9-0.

971
01:11:45,705 --> 01:11:49,416
Roger.
Confirm 2-0-5 per minute...

972
01:11:49,482 --> 01:11:53,377
and remaining fuel 8-7-9-0.

973
01:11:59,626 --> 01:12:03,556
No, no, Dimitri,
there must be some mistake.

974
01:12:03,628 --> 01:12:05,600
No, I'm certain of that.

975
01:12:05,673 --> 01:12:09,700
I'm perfectly certain
of that, Dimitri.

976
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,552
Just a second.
You know what he says?

977
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:14,789
He says one of the planes
hasn't turned back.

978
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:17,347
He says according to information
forwarded by our A ir Staffs...

979
01:12:17,419 --> 01:12:20,234
it's headed for
the missile complex at Laputa.

980
01:12:23,114 --> 01:12:25,930
That's impossible, Mr. President.

981
01:12:25,995 --> 01:12:27,970
I mean, look at the big board.

982
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:31,045
Thirty-four planes, 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes...

983
01:12:31,117 --> 01:12:33,865
and one of them
was targeted for Laputa.

984
01:12:36,684 --> 01:12:39,750
Dimitri, look, we've got
an acknowledgement from every plane...

985
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:42,951
except the four you've shot down.

986
01:12:49,997 --> 01:12:52,298
Hang on a second, Dimitri.

987
01:12:52,365 --> 01:12:55,561
He says their air defense now only
claims three aircraft confirmed.

988
01:12:55,629 --> 01:12:57,996
The fourth may only be damaged.

989
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:01,931
Mr. President...

990
01:13:01,996 --> 01:13:04,266
I'm beginning to smell
a big, fat Commie rat.

991
01:13:04,332 --> 01:13:08,042
I mean, supposing Kissoff is lying
about that fourth plane...

992
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:10,182
just looking for
an excuse to clobber us?

993
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:12,587
If the spaghetti hits the fan,
we're in trouble.

994
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:19,013
Dimitri, look,
if this report is true...

995
01:13:19,085 --> 01:13:22,565
and the plane manages
to bomb the target...

996
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:26,695
is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine?

997
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,692
Are you sure?

998
01:13:32,845 --> 01:13:37,221
Well, I guess you're just gonna have
to get that plane, Dimitri.

999
01:13:37,294 --> 01:13:40,229
I'm sorry they're jamming
your radar and flying so low...

1000
01:13:40,303 --> 01:13:42,408
but they're trained to do it.

1001
01:13:42,478 --> 01:13:44,072
It's initiative.

1002
01:13:45,711 --> 01:13:48,461
Look, Dimitri, you know
exactly where they're going...

1003
01:13:48,527 --> 01:13:51,559
and I'm sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane.

1004
01:13:54,606 --> 01:13:59,013
It's not gonna help either one of us
if the doomsday machine goes off, is it?

1005
01:14:00,494 --> 01:14:05,546
There's no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this!

1006
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:09,675
Keep your feet on the ground
when you're talking, Dimitri.

1007
01:14:09,744 --> 01:14:11,915
I am not...
I am not getting...

1008
01:14:11,984 --> 01:14:14,319
No, Dimitri, I'm just worried.

1009
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:16,206
That's all.

1010
01:14:16,272 --> 01:14:19,206
Now look, if our A ir Staffs say
its primary target is Laputa...

1011
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:23,075
and its secondary target is Borchov,
it's true.

1012
01:14:23,152 --> 01:14:24,526
You gotta believe it!

1013
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:28,170
Dimitri, can I give you
just one word...

1014
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,436
Can I give you just one word
of advice, Dimitri?

1015
01:14:31,505 --> 01:14:33,097
Listen, Dimitri.

1016
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:36,583
Put everything you've got into
those two sectors, and you can't miss!

1017
01:14:42,706 --> 01:14:46,218
Sir, if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate...

1018
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:50,249
I estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time...

1019
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,688
which will not even take us
as far as the primary.

1020
01:14:52,753 --> 01:14:56,528
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me that
you could get me to the primary!

1021
01:14:56,593 --> 01:15:00,271
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor...

1022
01:15:00,338 --> 01:15:02,061
not at 2-0-5.

1023
01:15:02,129 --> 01:15:04,301
I don't give a hoot in hell
how you do it...

1024
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:06,443
you just get me to
the primary, you hear?

1025
01:15:06,514 --> 01:15:09,810
I'm sorry, sir,
but those are the figures.

1026
01:15:09,875 --> 01:15:13,004
We'll be lucky to reach
weather ship at Tango Delta.

1027
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:15,178
Well, shoot!

1028
01:15:15,248 --> 01:15:19,406
We ain't come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink.

1029
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,383
What's the nearest
target of opportunity?

1030
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:32,429
Sir, if the rate of loss
does not increase...

1031
01:15:32,499 --> 01:15:36,112
we have a chance
to reach target 3-8-4...

1032
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:40,815
grid coordinate 0-0-3-6-9-1...

1033
01:15:40,882 --> 01:15:44,592
and possibly make it from there
to the Tango Delta weather ship.

1034
01:15:44,658 --> 01:15:46,698
What kind of a target
is that, anyhow?

1035
01:15:46,771 --> 01:15:50,547
Sir, that's the I.C.B.M.
complex at Kotloss.

1036
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:56,111
Alright.
Designating new target: 3-8-4.

1037
01:15:56,179 --> 01:15:59,049
Give me a head-iron that just as soon
as you get it worked out.

1038
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:15,409
We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Remember, we're all in this together.

1039
01:16:15,476 --> 01:16:19,153
We're right behind you,
we're with you all the way.

1040
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:22,798
Yes. We'll keep the line open.

1041
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:24,242
Alright, Dimitri.

1042
01:16:26,516 --> 01:16:27,891
General Turgidson...

1043
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:31,055
is there really a chance
for that plane to get through?

1044
01:16:32,692 --> 01:16:35,026
Mr. President,
if I may speak freely.

1045
01:16:35,093 --> 01:16:38,573
The Ruskie talks big, but frankly
we think he's short of know-how.

1046
01:16:38,645 --> 01:16:42,955
You can't expect ignorant peons
to understand a machine like our boys.

1047
01:16:43,029 --> 01:16:45,363
That's not meant as an insult,
Mr. Ambassador.

1048
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:47,917
We all know how much guts
the average Ruskie's got.

1049
01:16:47,989 --> 01:16:50,990
Look at all of them Nazis killed
off, and they still wouldn't quit!

1050
01:16:51,062 --> 01:16:52,885
Can't you stick to the point?

1051
01:16:52,951 --> 01:16:56,529
Well, sir,
if the pilot's good, see...

1052
01:16:56,599 --> 01:17:00,591
I mean, if he's really sharp,
he can barrel that baby in so low.

1053
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:04,971
You oughta see it! It's a sight!
A big plane like a 52! Vroom!

1054
01:17:05,045 --> 01:17:07,980
Its jet exhaust frying chickens
in the barnyard!

1055
01:17:08,053 --> 01:17:11,054
- But has he got a chance?
- Has he got a chance?

1056
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,501
Hell, ye...

1057
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,326
Navigator to Captain.

1058
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:42,735
Approaching target
at distance 1-0 miles.

1059
01:17:42,808 --> 01:17:46,005
Switch from green grid
to target orange.

1060
01:17:46,073 --> 01:17:49,040
Roger.
Ready for final bomb run check.

1061
01:17:49,112 --> 01:17:50,485
- Take over, Ace.
- Roger.

1062
01:17:55,544 --> 01:17:57,933
- D.S.O. ready.
- Bombardier ready, sir.

1063
01:17:58,008 --> 01:18:00,113
Bomb fusing, master safety on.

1064
01:18:00,184 --> 01:18:03,151
Electronic, barometric,
time and impact.

1065
01:18:03,224 --> 01:18:05,461
Bomb fusing,
master safeties on.

1066
01:18:05,529 --> 01:18:08,464
Electronic, barometric,
time and impact.

1067

1083
01:19:01,179 --> 01:19:02,553
Second safety.

1084

1085

1096
01:20:02,494 --> 01:20:06,486

- Roger.

1097
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:23,927
Still negative, sir.
The operating circuits are dead, sir.

1098
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:32,892
Stay on the bomb run, Ace. I'm going
down below and see what I can do.

1099
01:20:45,311 --> 01:20:46,718
Stay on the bomb run.

1100
01:20:46,783 --> 01:20:50,809
I'm gonna get them doors open
if it harelips everybody on Bear Creek!

1101
01:21:42,178 --> 01:21:44,959
Target orange grid reference checks.

1102
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,229

01:21:47,298 --> 01:21:49,303

1117
01:22:46,818 --> 01:22:48,444
Roger. Four miles.

1118

1119
01:22:51,365 --> 01:22:53,852

1120
01:23:03,685 --> 01:23:06,107
Target distance: three miles.

1121
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,571
Roger. Three miles.

1122
01:23:08,645 --> 01:23:12,158
Target in sight!
Where in hell is Major Kong?

1123
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:36,159
What about Major Kong?

1124
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:06,752
Mr. President, I would not
rule out the chance...

1125
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:09,756
to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens.

1126
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:12,614
It would be quite easy...

1127
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:19,808
at the bottom of some
of our deeper mine shafts.

1128
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:24,517
The radioactivity would never penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep.

1129
01:24:24,584 --> 01:24:28,674
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient
improvements in dwelling space...

1130
01:24:28,743 --> 01:24:30,597
could easily be provided.

1131
01:24:30,663 --> 01:24:33,314
How long would you have
to stay down there?

1132
01:24:33,383 --> 01:24:37,092
Well, that's, you know...

1133
01:24:37,161 --> 01:24:39,714
Cobalt thorium G.

1134
01:24:49,545 --> 01:24:53,223
Radioactive half-life of...

1135
01:24:55,209 --> 01:24:59,748
I would think that possibly
one hundred years.

1136
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:05,822
You mean, people could actually
stay down there for 100 years?

1137
01:25:05,897 --> 01:25:08,035
It would not be difficult,
Mein Fuhrer.

1138
01:25:08,105 --> 01:25:10,243
Nuclear reactors could...

1139
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:12,582
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1140
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:16,294
Nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely.

1141
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:19,079
Greenhouses could maintain
plant life.

1142
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:22,592
Animals could be bred
and slaughtered.

1143
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:26,920
A quick survey would have to be made of
the available mine sites in the country.

1144
01:25:26,986 --> 01:25:30,631
But I would guess
that a dwelling space...

1145
01:25:30,698 --> 01:25:34,211
for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided.

1146
01:25:34,282 --> 01:25:37,282
Well, I would hate
to have to decide...

1147
01:25:37,354 --> 01:25:40,137
who stays up and who goes down.

1148
01:25:40,203 --> 01:25:43,946
Well, that would not be
necessary, Mr. President.

1149
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:46,762
It could easily be accomplished
with a computer.

1150
01:25:46,828 --> 01:25:49,030
And the computer could
be set and programmed...

1151
01:25:49,098 --> 01:25:52,033
to accept factors
from youth, health...

1152
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:55,139
sexual fertility, intelligence...

1153
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:57,600
and a cross-section
of necessary skills.

1154
01:25:57,674 --> 01:25:59,846
Of course, it would be
absolutely vital...

1155
01:25:59,915 --> 01:26:03,712
that our top government
and military men be included...

1156
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:08,425
to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition.

1157
01:26:14,221 --> 01:26:17,034
Naturally, they would breed
prodigiously.

1158
01:26:17,099 --> 01:26:19,783
There would be much time
and little to do.

1159
01:26:21,323 --> 01:26:26,058
But with the proper breeding techniques
and a ratio of, say...

1160
01:26:26,124 --> 01:26:28,775
ten females to each male...

1161
01:26:28,844 --> 01:26:33,284
they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product...

1162
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:35,048
within 20 years.

1163
01:26:36,205 --> 01:26:38,825
But look, Doctor.
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors...

1164
01:26:38,895 --> 01:26:43,780
be so grief-stricken
and anguished that they...

1165
01:26:43,851 --> 01:26:47,201
well, envy the dead
and not want to go on living?

1166
01:26:47,277 --> 01:26:49,994
No, sir. Excuse me.

1167
01:26:58,894 --> 01:27:02,669
When they go down into the mine,
everyone would still be alive.

1168
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:04,742
There would be
no shocking memories...

1169
01:27:04,815 --> 01:27:09,286
and the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind...

1170
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:12,108
combined with a spirit of...

1171
01:27:12,173 --> 01:27:14,508
bold curiosity for
the adventure ahead!

1172
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:33,167
Doctor...

1173
01:27:35,278 --> 01:27:40,495
you mentioned the ratio
of ten women to each man.

1174
01:27:40,558 --> 01:27:43,558
Now, wouldn't that
necessitate the abandonment...

1175
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:47,276
of the so-called
monogamous sexual relationship?

1176
01:27:47,344 --> 01:27:50,824
I mean, as far as men were concerned?

1177
01:27:50,896 --> 01:27:52,205
Regrettably, yes.

1178
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:57,422
But it is a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race.

1179
01:27:57,489 --> 01:28:02,276
I hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious...

1180
01:28:03,983 --> 01:28:05,839
service along these lines...

1181
01:28:05,904 --> 01:28:09,549
the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics...

1182
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:13,228
which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature.

1183
01:28:13,296 --> 01:28:16,974
I must confess, you have an
astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.

1184
01:28:18,097 --> 01:28:19,471
Thank you, sir.

1185
01:28:19,537 --> 01:28:22,385
We ought to look at this
from the military point of view.

1186
01:28:22,449 --> 01:28:26,225
I mean,
supposing the Ruskies...

1187
01:28:26,289 --> 01:28:29,102
stashed away some big bombs,
see, and we didn't?

1188
01:28:29,168 --> 01:28:31,951
When they come out in 100 years,
they could take over!

1189
01:28:32,016 --> 01:28:33,708
I agree, Mr. President.

1190
01:28:33,777 --> 01:28:37,225
They might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mine shaft space.

1191
01:28:37,297 --> 01:28:41,737
It'd be extremely naive of us to
imagine that these new developments...

1192
01:28:41,809 --> 01:28:44,624
are gonna cause any change
in Soviet expansionist policy!

1193
01:28:44,689 --> 01:28:47,408
I mean, we must be
increasingly on the alert...

1194
01:28:47,475 --> 01:28:49,896
to prevent them from taking over
other mine shaft space...

1195
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,825
in order to breed more
prodigiously than we do...

1196
01:28:51,889 --> 01:28:54,888
thus knocking us out through
superior numbers when we emerge!

1197
01:28:54,961 --> 01:28:58,890
Mr. President, we must not allow
a mineshaft gap!

1198
01:28:58,961 --> 01:29:00,968
Sir!

1199
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:03,213
I have a plan...

1200
01:29:04,689 --> 01:29:06,927
Mein Fuhrer...

1201
01:29:06,994 --> 01:29:09,482
I can walk!

1202
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:50,700
