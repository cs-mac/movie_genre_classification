2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,140
Now, you've made
a lot of positive changes

3
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:06,505
in the past
couple of months.

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,672
And the next
positive change is

5
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,574
that I want to
get pregnant again.

6
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,444
You're trying to have a
baby to save a marriage

7
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:14,546
that you never really
wanted in the first place.

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,681
I just want some time
alone with my husband.

9
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,251
But we don't have room for her.
Where would she sleep?

10
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,619
We can all stay
at my parents' house.

11
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,589
I would like you to go
ahead, and move out.

12
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,324
And what if you had
gotten pregnant again?

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,360
I know.

14
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:31,263
You and I, we're not
friends anymore. Fine.

15
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,465
Look, I know what you're here for.
What am I here for?

16
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,634
And you know what, you can't have him.
Just check his phone.

17
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,569
Adrian is still in love
with Ricky.

18
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:38,670
I feel a little relieved.

19
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:40,472
Well, would you feel
relieved if we split up?

20
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:43,375
Maybe I could rent
Ashley's room from you.

21
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:44,609
Maybe I could live here.

22
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,511
Are you hiding something?
I'm not hiding anything.

23
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,347
Which doesn't mean that you don't
have messages from Adrian.

24
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,782
Either you trust me,
or you don't.

25
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,719
<i>Aren't you bored just talking to?</i>
<i> Good night, Ricky.</i>

26
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,488
What are you doing?

27
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,361
It's been a week.
A whole week.

28
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,298
It may be longer. I don't want to
be with someone who can't trust me.

29
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,632
I thought you trusted me.

30
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,402
I do trust you. I do!

31
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:12,404
That's why
I stood up for you,

32
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:14,272
I stood up for you when Karlee accused
you of trying to sleep with her.

33
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,507
And yet, you didn't
trust me enough

34
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,476
to know that if I have
messages from Adrian,

35
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,278
they don't mean anything, they
don't mean anything at all.

36
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,348
They were meant to be a record so if
you ever questioned why she called,

37
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,283
or what she said
or anything else,

38
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,385
I'd have some evidence
that I've done nothing.

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,489
Did you see that I didn't
reply to any of that stuff?

40
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:34,426
Ricky, please? Please just let
me come back to the apartment.

41
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,462
I'll see you at school.

42
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,499
No, I can't take it anymore, I can't.
I just can't.

43
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,434
I don't think
I can come to school.

44
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:44,302
Dad's taking John
to the nursery.

45
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,639
Someone's at my door.
I have to go.

46
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,508
Who is it, Adrian?

47
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,277
If it is Adrian, I didn't
invite her over here.

48
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:53,645
Tell you what, hold on,
and I'll tell you.

49
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,352
It's not Adrian.

50
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,256
No, it's not Adrian,
it's me.

51
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,459
Long time.
How'd you find me?

52
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:10,529
Phone app.
Find Ricky. It's new.

53
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,664
And why'd you
want to find me?

54
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,434
I think I might be
getting arrested.

55
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,669
Arrested for what, then?

56
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:19,437
You better not be
doing drugs or drinking.

57
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,605
'Cause if you're
doing that stuff,

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,240
I can't help you.
I won't help you.

59
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,409
No, that's not
the problem.

60
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:27,312
Oh, God.
Sex with an underage girl?

61
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:29,481
I'm underage.
And, no, it wasn't that.

62
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,283
What is it?
I don't have a lot of time here,

63
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,218
and I've got
problems of my own.

64
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:35,587
I sent a picture of my girlfriend
out to everyone on my phone list.

65
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:37,422
What's wrong with sending a
picture of your girlfriend

66
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,224
to everyone
on your phone list?

67
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:41,259
She was in
a state of undress.

68
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,662
Huh? She didn't have
any clothes on. Any.

69
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,597
Why would you share
a picture like that?

70
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:50,569
She's hot. And she broke up
with me, and I was angry.

71
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,271
That was a really stupid thing to do.
For her.

72
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,274
For you. Those kind of photos get
out there, you can't get them back.

73
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,277
Any time anyone puts her name
into a computer in the future,

74
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,579
that photo you sent out
could pop up

75
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,415
when she applies to college,
or for a job, or...

76
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,183
This is serious.

77
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,485
Yeah, I realize that.
Her father already had it out for me.

78
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,187
Oh geez, Ethan.

79
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,524
I know, I know.
So can you help me out?

80
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,259
You gotta be
over 18 now,

81
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,528
you could be
responsible for me.

82
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:19,698
And I got to get someone to
be responsible for me, and...

83
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,634
This is a nice place.

84
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:25,270
Uh-uh.
I can't. I have a son.

85
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,439
I'm sure you've heard.
I had a baby with my girlfriend.

86
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,241
They live here.

87
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,610
They live here? Doesn't look
like they live here. You sure?

88
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,346
Yeah, go in the other room, there
are toys and a bed, and...

89
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,348
It wouldn't matter, I can't
be responsible for you.

90
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,317
I don't think the authorities would
even let me, and I just can't.

91
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,520
I have to take care of Amy and John, and
I'm going to college next year, and...

92
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,290
Man, whatever.
Don't worry about it.

93
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:51,496
Just go with me to turn myself
in, that's all I'm asking.

94
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,631
That's all, huh?

95
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,470
I'll go with you, okay? I just
have to make a phone call first.

96
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,572
I'm gonna call my mom and
see if she can do anything.

97
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,242
Did you have breakfast?

98
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,678
No, I haven't had breakfast,
not for most of my life.

99
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,315
Been there.
I'll get you something.

100
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,550
Yeah.

101
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,187
No, we're fine with
you staying here,

102
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,456
if that's okay with George,
it's okay with us.

103
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:24,362
You look strange.
You look happy.

104
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,497
I am happy.

105
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,565
No, you're not
a happy person.

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,634
Not normally. Normally,
you're very serious.

107
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,303
Maybe you're getting
sick or something.

108
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,504
No, I'm not
sick or something.

109
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,506
And, yeah,
sometimes I am serious,

110
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,341
but I am a happy person.

111
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,609
When?

112
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,644
When I'm not dealing with
other people's problems,

113
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:44,349
when I can just relax and
enjoy my husband and my home.

114
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,685
Nah, that's not it.
I'm going with sick or something.

115
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:51,523
Or maybe you're getting that empty-nest
syndrome women your age get.

116
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,727
Women my age, huh? Well, if I got
anything, it's whatever the opposite

117
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,563
of the empty-nest
syndrome is.

118
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,536
You gonna answer that?
Ricky.

119
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,339
Oh, I'm not talking to him.
Why not?

120
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,541
'Cause he's not being
very nice to Amy.

121
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,344
Are you not being
very nice to Amy?

122
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,645
Who told you that?

123
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:16,548
How many times do
I have to say it?

124
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,250
I'm being nice,
and I'm going to be nicer.

125
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,619
I'm going to talk to her
when I get to school.

126
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,323
But before I can get to school,
I have one little problem.

127
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,292
Remember that kid who lived
with us for a while?

128
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:31,229
Ethan? The one that
everyone is looking for,

129
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,266
because of that sexting incident?
Is he there?

130
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,635
He's not here, but I
could probably find him.

131
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,604
I owe you.

132
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:43,308
Ricky, don't get caught up in
this mess. He is in serious trouble.

133
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,511
Now if you know where he
is, you better tell me.

134
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:51,349
And get your ass over here and talk
to Amy. She's been crying for days.

135
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,487
What is that about?

136
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,588
They broke up.

So, according to the prenup,
you don't own the place,

144
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,708
but my dad says that
you're out of college.

145
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:24,711
Cable, utilities,
all that stuff included.

146
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:25,946
That's not
in the prenup.

147
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,849
I know, but my dad's feeling
very generous right now,

148
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:31,184
and he knows that you'll be
starting college in the fall,

149
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:36,056
and you can keep it, and everything in it
until you graduate.

150
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:37,858
That's what he said.

151
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:40,894
Wow. Uh...

152
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:44,865
Do I have to give
you the ring back?

153
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,734
No, you might want to move it
to the other hand,

154
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:50,137
but, uh, no.
Keep the ring.

155
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:55,042
So, friends?

156
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,778
Sure.

157
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:02,783
Even friends with benefits,
if you want.

158
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:07,955
That's, uh, not an offer
I had anticipated,

159
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:11,992
what with
with Ricky and all.

160
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:15,862
But again, I loved you.

161
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:21,735
And I loved you.
So...

162
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:26,807
Who knows? Maybe some day
I'll take you up on that.

163
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:28,909
How about today?

164
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:32,112
We have to go to school.

165
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,185
Come on, why would
you do that?

166
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,821
You're in love with Ricky.

167
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:52,245
Because we're friends,
and we're still married.

168
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,212
We're married friends.

169
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:02,809
So?
One for the road?

170
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,946
I can't.

171
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:08,949
We shouldn't.
Ah, why not?

172
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:15,989
Amy, come on,
you have to go to school.

173
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:17,589
Why do I have
to miss school.

174
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:20,180
I can miss one day of school.

175
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:22,162
I can't go to school
like this.

176
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:24,898
Dad, I have been to school
every single day this week

177
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:26,700
just to try to
talk to Ricky,

178
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:29,136
and he still won't
talk to me, not really.

179
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,806
He just wants more time
and more time.

180
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,876
I screwed
everything up, Dad.

181
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,144
You screwed
everything up?

182
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:38,979
He's been hiding the fact that
Adrian's been calling him.

183
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,847
He screwed
everything up.

184
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:42,849
No, I had no right to check
his phone messages.

185
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:44,985
No, you didn't,
but everyone does it.

186
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:47,220
Everyone like who?

187
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,757
I don't know.
Doesn't everyone?

188
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,993
Do you?
Do I what?

189
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:54,995
Do you sneak around and do you
listen to my phone messages,

190
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:56,730
and Mom's and Ashley's?

191
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:57,864
Your mom and your sister
aren't even here.

192
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,700
You're not saying...
What? I pay the bill.

193
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,837
Dad, I can't believe that you've
been listening to my phone messages!

194
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:06,706
No, I haven't.
I don't know the password.

195
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,008
But I mean the
text messages and emails,

196
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,910
they're right there
on the phone.

197
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,711
It hasn't happened
that many times.

198
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,013
And, hey, you don't think Ricky
has ever checked your phone?

199
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,748
Are you kidding?

200
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:15,816
You think he hasn't done the
exact same thing you did?

201
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,851
Why wouldn't he?

202
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:20,887
Why would he? There's nothing on my
phone he'd be interested in.

203
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:22,823
Besides, he's not
that kind of person.

204
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:25,859
Yes, he is. Anyone can be that kind of
person under the wrong circumstances,

205
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,694
or right... Whatever.

206
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:29,096
No, not Ricky,
he wouldn't do that.

207
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,833
Well, yes, he would do that.
He probably did do that. Ask him.

208
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:36,036
No! He's already angry enough at me
without making him angrier.

209
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,804
I'll ask him.

210
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:42,008
You go to school,
I'll ask him.

211
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:43,700
Why does anyone even have
emails or texts you wouldn't

212
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:44,925
want anyone to look at?

213
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:47,948
You know what they call emails and
texts in a courtroom? Evidence.

214
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:50,117
Yeah.
Found out the hard way.

215
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,188
Sure you don't want to take a
quick look just for reference?

216
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:57,891
No. I don't.
How old is she?

217
00:09:57,925 --> 00:09:59,092
Sixteen.
How old are you?

218
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:00,794
Fourteen,
but I'll be 15.

219
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:03,063
I'll be in high school
next year, I hope.

220
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:04,798
How long was this girl
your girlfriend?

221
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:06,032
Three weeks.

222
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,934
Oh, geez. She sent you
a picture like that when

223
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,703
you'd only been
together three weeks?

224
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,071
She sent it to me
the first week.

225
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:13,974
You know, it's a status thing
to have a picture like that.

226
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,909
She sent it to me
showing it to guys.

227
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:18,812
Did she know you were
sending it to guys?

228
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:21,715
I wasn't.
broke up with me.

229
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,150
I was offended,
you know?

230
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:24,718
You need some help.

231
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:25,752
That's what I'm here for.

232
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:27,787
Some professional help.

233
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:29,990
As much as you get around,
you're like a professional.

234
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:33,827
No, I'm not. And I've changed
a lot since you saw me.

235
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:35,162
When did you last see me?

236
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:38,832
Three years?

237
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:41,134
What happened? Why'd you leave
our house? Refresh my memory.

238
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:45,805
I stole something from the
house, a set of knives.

239
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,209
Not steak knives, scalpels.
They belonged to the doctor.

240
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:51,978
Oh, yeah,
I remember, antiques.

241
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:53,780
What were you going
to do with scalpels?

242
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:55,148
Are you kidding?
They were beautiful.

243
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:57,050
I got hundred bucks
for them on the street.

244
00:10:57,084 --> 00:10:59,052
And what did you do
with the hundred bucks?

245
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,187
Sneakers.

246
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,890
They're gonna put
me in jail this time.

247
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:05,225
You know they are.

248
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,761
I don't know anything other than
you have to turn yourself in.

249
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:10,764
If the cops are looking for you,
you have to turn yourself in.

250
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:13,033
And you're still under 18, so,
hopefully, they won't put you in jail.

251
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,741
Why aren't you at school?

252
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:22,809
Why aren't you at school?

253
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,177
I have a situation
I have to take care of.

254
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:26,079
Oh, and what is that?

255
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:28,882
Sorry.

256
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,016
Get out here.

257
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:35,088
Hey, she's hot.

258
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,365
Hey, wait up.

259
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,170
I want to
apologize, okay?

260
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:55,373
I admit I did call Grant and
Jack just to make you crazy.

261
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:58,009
And I apologize.

262
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:02,246
Well, at least you
didn't call Daniel.

263
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,418
You didn't call Daniel?

264
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:13,024
How did you even find him?
He's listed, geez.

265
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:15,093
You would do that?
You would go after my new boyfriend?

266
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:17,095
Well, there wasn't much point in
going after your old boyfriends,

267
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,030
you don't really
care about them.

268
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:22,033
And they turned me down.
Good.

269
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,369
But I care about you, and I care
that you're just trying to hurt me.

270
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:27,071
You told Amy that I was
trying to seduce Ben.

271
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:28,940
That I was trying to trick him
into getting me pregnant.

272
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:31,075
Yeah, well, you are,
or you were.

273
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,343
No, I'm not.

274
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,979
And Ben and I are
just friends now.

275
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:36,914
Yeah, because now
you want Ricky back.

276
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,950
And you told
Amy that, too.

277
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,152
So what? You don't even care that
Amy has tried to be your friend.

278
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:43,054
You're going after
Ricky anyway.

279
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:44,989
I think that's horrible, Adrian,
that's really horrible.

280
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:46,057
They have a son.

281
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:49,327
Hey, hey, they broke up,
he's fair game.

282
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,329
If not me,
it'll be someone else.

283
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,231
What are you talking about?
They didn't break up.

284
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,035
Where'd you hear that?
From Ricky.

285
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,336
So you're talking to
Ricky?

286
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,872
I talked to Ricky, yes.

287
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,308
And, Amy is no longer
at the apartment.

288
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:06,277
Well, that makes
me sad, really sad.

289
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:08,846
It looked like everything was
going to work out for them.

290
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:12,116
Yeah, it almost never does when two
teenagers have a baby together.

291
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:16,854
But it could. It could if their friends
and family supported them, maybe.

292
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,556
And that's the right thing
to do, don't you think?

293
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,993
To support Amy and Ricky being together
as opposed to trying to break them up?

294
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:24,162
I mean, it's difficult enough for them,
already, I'm sure, without someone

295
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:26,898
intentionally trying
to break them up.

296
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,052
You don't want to do
that, Adrian.

297
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:29,915
You're really not that
type of person, are you?

298
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,904
Maybe I am.

299
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:37,075
'Cause, well, thinking about
being with him makes me happy.

300
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,243
Yeah, but other things, other,
guys, could make you really happy

301
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,313
if you're ready for that.

302
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:46,284
Look, if I could get you a really,
really hot date, would you go out then?

303
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:48,152
I mean, you and Ben, you're
not divorced yet, right?

304
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:50,254
But do you guys have, like, a
agreement about that sort of thing?

305
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:54,192
You're going to get
me a really hot date?

306
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:56,260
Yes, Daniel has
friends, you know.

307
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,963
And a really cute
one that lives upstairs.

308
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:00,998
Does he look like Daniel?
Yeah.

309
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:04,068
Then I'd definitely
be interested.

310
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,918
Hey, Grace.

311
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:21,953
Help.

312
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,921
What kind of help
did you need?

313
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:26,057
Well, first of all, I need you
to always be honest with me

314
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,192
and tell me when
Adrian calls you.

315
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:30,828
It's not something that I
wanted to text you about,

316
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:32,130
and I haven't seen
you to tell you.

317
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,931
Good excuse.

318
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:37,135
Grace, I've had
finals all week.

319
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,037
I'm a little crazy right
now.

320
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:43,207
If it ever happens again, which I doubt
that it will because I've blocked

321
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:47,245
her from my phone, I will tell you.
I'll text you right away.

322
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:51,082
Really? You blocked her?
I blocked her.

323
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:54,986
Well, you still should have told me and
since you didn't maybe you owe me?

324
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,156
I don't know if I owe you,
but what'd you have in mind?

325
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,224
Okay, we need to find
Adrian a date.

326
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,760
Isn't she married?
No.

327
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:03,861
<i>Yes, she is.</i>

328
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,062
Not really, no.

329
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:06,798
What does that mean?

330
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:09,200
It means they're getting a divorce
and they have an agreement.

331
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:12,770
Okay, well, still, I don't
want to play matchmaker.

332
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:14,071
We have to find
Adrian a date.

333
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:15,907
Otherwise, she's going
to go after Ricky

334
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:17,809
and she's going to get hurt,
and I don't want that.

335
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,911
I'm her friend, or I'm
trying to be her friend.

336
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:21,145
Who would I fix her up
with?

337
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,780
That guy upstairs.

338
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:25,950
What guy upstairs?
There are 50 guys upstairs.

339
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,952
Oh, no. No.
No. No, no, no.

340
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:29,395
He's a player.

341
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,736
A girl who just lost
a baby and is getting

342
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:33,080
a divorce does not
need a player.

343
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:36,861
She really doesn't even need
to be dating, does she?

344
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,865
Well, she can handle a player,
she dated Ricky for years.

345
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,867
I so don't want
to be involved in this.

346
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,202
You're the one who told me
to try to be her friend.

347
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,903
I'm trying to be her
friend.

348
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:47,872
I'm trying not
to be her friend.

349
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:50,107
Please?

350
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,811
But Jesse is graduating
in a couple of weeks.

351
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:55,246
Yeah, but I'm going
to graduation

352
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,149
and all that other stuff
that graduates do.

353
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:00,751
But he'll be going
away to school.

354
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:02,153
He's coming back
here on the weekends,

355
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,155
or I'll go there
on the weekends.

356
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:05,790
I wish you would
have told me that

357
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:06,991
you still wanted to get
back together with him.

358
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:08,960
I've always wanted to get
back together with him.

359
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:10,061
Yeah, but you
didn't say anything.

360
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,162
And I broke up with Jack.

361
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:14,165
That has nothing to do
with me and Jesse.

362
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,967
Yes, it does.

363
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:18,069
I would have just hung in there for a
couple of weeks until school was over

364
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,071
and we could have done all
the senior stuff together.

365
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,772
Jack broke up with you.

366
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,075
Yes, but I accepted.
I wouldn't have accepted.

367
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,209
Accepted what?

368
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:27,144
Oh, hey, Amy,
how are you?

369
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:29,814
Hey, we looked for you when we
got to school this morning.

370
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:31,816
Yeah, I'm a little late,
I just got here.

371
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,917
Are you okay?

372
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,218
Um, no, not really.

373
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:37,088
I went by Ricky's apartment
to see if we could talk,

374
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,023
but there was
some kid over there,

375
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:42,126
and he obviously cared more
about talking to him right now.

376
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,061
Whose kid?
Yeah, whose kid?

377
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:45,162
Does he have another kid?

378
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:47,131
No, no, no, no, no.

379
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:49,934
Just some kid who lived with him
when he was at his mother's house.

380
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,037
His mother had other foster kids in
and out while Ricky was living there,

381
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:55,873
and this one
just showed up.

382
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,910
I wasn't even going to come in today
but I do want to talk to him.

383
00:16:58,944 --> 00:17:00,778
I want to ask him
something.

384
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:04,749
If I can even get
him to talk to me.

385
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:07,118
Do you guys think that Ricky's
ever looked through my phone?

386
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:11,689
Ever checked my text messages or
emails or anything like that?

387
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:12,924
Yes.

388
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,026
What?
Everybody does it.

389
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,061
And you're living
together.

390
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:19,997
So, unless you've had your phone in your
possession every moment of every day,

391
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:22,133
then I'm sure he has.

392
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,968
Do you do that?
Either of you?

393
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,903
Have you ever looked through
your boyfriend's phone

394
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:27,071
without them
knowing about it?

395
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:30,007
No. But Jesse and I
trust each other.

396
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,876
Oh, come on.

397
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,111
I've looked through
Jason's.

398
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:35,947
You never looked
through Ashley's?

399
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:37,181
No.

400
00:17:37,215 --> 00:17:39,750
You looked through
Jack's phone?

401
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:43,154
Well, yes, and it wasn't
always easy, either.

402
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,791
It was usually when he'd run into
some fast food place or something

403
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:47,858
and leave it in the car.

404
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:49,827
You're kidding me.

405
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,964
Did you find anything
that, like, bothered you?

406
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:55,166
No, he just sends
really dumb texts.

407
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,767
Any texts to Grace?

408
00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:59,103
Yeah.
The dumbest texts of all.

409
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:01,772
But the thing is,

410
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:04,075
if you look at his
texts or emails,

411
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:05,676
you can't say anything.

412
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:06,777
No.

413
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:08,145
Yeah, you have to come
up with some other way

414
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,948
that you got the information
that you sneaked around to get,

415
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:14,652
or at least say that
you got it somewherelse.

416
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:18,122
Yeah, I'm really careful with
what I say in my texts or emails,

417
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:21,058
especially after that
mis-mail to my dad that time.

418
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:22,994
Am I the only one here
who feels guilty

419
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:25,096
about looking through someone's
phone that's not mine?

420
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,099
Probably.
But you are a good girl.

421
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:29,900
Yeah. Always have been.

422
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,102
I'm a teenage mother.

423
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:34,939
Yeah, I bet that happens
mostly to good girls.

424
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:36,040
Oh, hi, Amy.

425
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:38,709
Girls.

426
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:41,946
Hey, Adrian.

427
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,848
I was looking for you.

428
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:45,082
I heard about you and
Ricky.

429
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:47,718
I'm so sorry.

430
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,953
I don't know what
you're talking about.

431
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:50,688
Yeah, you do.

432
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:53,991
So how long have you
been out, a week now?

433
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,127
Just for your information,

434
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:59,997
Ricky has a kid who needed
some help staying with him.

435
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:01,699
He's not interested
in you anyway,

436
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:02,733
whether I'm there or not.

437
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:04,702
He might be.

438
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,670
Especially when he
hears I'm dating again.

439
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:09,874
What? Come on.
What do you mean?

440
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:11,108
You're dating your
husband again?

441
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:13,044
You're going out
with Ben again?

442
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:16,881
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not Ben. Other guys.

443
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:19,784
Guys that Ricky
would be jealous of.

444
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:22,653
Guys that are in college.

445
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:24,688
Guys that Grace's boyfriend
thinks I should meet.

446
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:25,823
You know, so I can
get out of high school,

447
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:27,691
and try out a whole
new playing field.

448
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:30,895
Oh, uh, by the way,

449
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:32,830
you listened to my
phone messages?

450
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:36,033
So what? You never listened to
any of Ben's phone messages?

451
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:38,869
Never checked any of his
text messages or emails?

452
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:39,904
Of course not.

453
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,839
You're lying.

454
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:45,109
I think.

455
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,079
Well, we'll never
know, will we?

456
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:52,850
Because if I ever did do something so
unscrupulous as to check Ben's phone,

457
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:54,885
well, I definitely
didn't get caught.

458
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:05,076
It's child pornography?

459
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:07,569
Child pornography?

460
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:09,471
You saw the picture.

461
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:10,539
She's a minor.

462
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,641
She's a child.
She's my child,

463
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:14,776
and you sent around
pictures of her, naked.

464
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,545
She's 16.

465
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:18,513
She knew what she was doing
when she sent me that picture.

466
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:19,815
So you didn't take
the picture?

467
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,349
Who took the picture?

468
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,451
She took the picture.

469
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:27,622
So anyway, the problem
is that you forwarded the photo.

470
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:29,624
That's distributing
child pornography.

471
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:33,795
Again, she is not a child.

472
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,463
She is not, sir.

473
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:37,666
And she doesn't even care
that I sent it around.

474
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,635
I mean, yeah, other guys'
girlfriends have gotten upset,

475
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,638
but they're not like her.

476
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,608
Are you kidding me?
She's devastated.

477
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:49,477
She's devastated you saw
it and found out about it.

478
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:50,512
She wanted me to...

479
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:53,682
Okay, maybe not wanted,

480
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:56,351
but she doesn't care if
people see the photo.

481
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:57,719
She considers it art.

482
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:58,753
Oh, my...

483
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,689
And she's very...

484
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:02,591
You know,
she has a lot of...

485
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:07,562
Confidence.
Okay, look, you little loser,

486
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:10,699
you can't send naked pictures of my
daughter around to half the school

487
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:12,334
and not go to jail for it.

488
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,470
Uh...

489
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:18,640
Ethan, you want
to step back outside?

490
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:19,774
Certainly.

491
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:33,788
What happened to the dude?

492
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:35,390
The dude...

493
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:39,527
...is in school.
I sent him back to school.

494
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:41,529
You're still telling
him what to do?

495
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:42,764
He's 18.

496
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:44,799
I'm going to be telling him
what to do until he's 40.

497
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:46,735
Maybe longer.

498
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,770
Lucky him.

499
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:52,507
So you tired of
getting in trouble yet?

500
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,808
You know, I don't know
what the big deal is.

501
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:56,478
The big deal is you
broke the law again.

502
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,747
Let me ask you something.

503
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:02,317
Were those new sneakers worth
getting taken out of our house?

504
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:06,655
No.

505
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:08,623
Guy stole 'em from
me two weeks later.

506
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:18,600
They actually let you
have your phone back?

507
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:36,384
You're back up.
Let's go.

508
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:55,470
Um...

509
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:58,373
Do you ever

510
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:02,610
pick up your kids' phones and
check out the messages on them?

511
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:05,246
Who's asking, you, or did
one of my kids complain?

512
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:06,548
No, it's me. It's just me.

513
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:08,717
I just know someone
that that happened to.

514
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,618
Is that why those
two are upset?

515
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:12,487
He got nosy with her
phone?

516
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:13,621
No, the other way around.

517
00:23:13,656 --> 00:23:15,323
Oh, geez.

518
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:16,725
Oh, let me guess.

519
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,361
Messages from Adrian?

520
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:22,397
Yeah. And Amy got
caught listening to them.

521
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:23,698
How'd she get the
password?

522
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,533
It was "John."

523
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:30,372
They all pick stupid
passwords, if left to themselves.

524
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:32,273
My daughters and
I have an agreement.

525
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:35,477
I have full access to
anything on their phones

526
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:37,679
and the passwords
to check the phones.

527
00:23:37,713 --> 00:23:40,348
And once a week
I do check them.

528
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:42,717
Never on the same day,
never the same time.

529
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:45,687
Cuts down on any
of the phone crap.

530
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:48,289
Have you ever seen
pictures of my daughters?

531
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:50,392
No.
There's a reason for that.

532
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,327
What's the reason?

533
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:56,331
They're hot.

534
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:58,500
And they don't need to be advertised
around this joint with the two hounds

535
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:01,302
I'm sorry.

536
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,238
I forgot that one
of them is your son.

537
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:06,274
So, you have
hot daughters, huh?

538
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:07,609
Like that's a surprise.

539
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:12,247
It's a blessing
and a curse.

540
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:15,250
I have got them in
all-girls private schools

541
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:17,385
and I'm going to keep them in
an all-girls private school

542
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,221
until they've got PhDs.

543
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:21,556
That's gonna make
'em gay, you know.

544
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:23,558
I'm kidding.

545
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,461
Not that I would mind.

546
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:28,430
I might prefer that.

547
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:31,266
Cut down on the chance for some
guy to do something stupid

548
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,367
and get one of them...

549
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:35,503
Again, I'm sorry.

550
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,639
Oh, apology accepted.

551
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:40,542
I know it's not the best thing that
happened to Ricky and Amy and John,

552
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:43,278
but it's not like nothing
good came of it.

553
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,213
Ladies.

554
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:46,347
Oh. Hi.

555
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:52,487
Right, I haven't seen you since
I fired you from the office.

556
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:53,655
Sorry about that, Bunny.

557
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,291
And what about me?

558
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:58,226
You I have to talk to.

559
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:00,228
Because?

560
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:02,397
I guess folks
are going to know.

561
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:05,433
Betty and I are splitting
up.

562
00:25:05,468 --> 00:25:07,535
Oh, what happened?

563
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,636
She wants
to go to college.

564
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:15,510
Oh, you're not joking.

565
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:18,246
No, I'm not.

566
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,383
And that would break up two people if
one of them wanted to go to college?

567
00:25:22,418 --> 00:25:26,554
It just didn't work out. We decided
we'll be happier not married,

568
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:30,225
and that's that.
It's nobody's business.

569
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:33,394
No one asked, you volunteered.
I mean, just for the record.

570
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:38,233
Just in case you want to use that to fire
me from here or, you know, anything.

571
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:44,472
I, on the other hand,
never hold a grudge.

572
00:25:44,507 --> 00:25:47,575
I completely and totally
understand why I got fired.

573
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,178
And why is that?

574
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:53,414
Can't be trusted.
Can't be trusted staying sober,

575
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:56,317
can't be trusted with
anything else. No?

576
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:59,454
Well, yeah, but that's what
I imagine you're thinking.

577
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:01,422
That's not what I'm thinking.
What I'm thinking is that

578
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:04,192
everyone deserves
a second chance, everyone.

579
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:06,461
What about Bunny?
No.

580
00:26:06,495 --> 00:26:10,465
Oh, well, actually, I think
this would be my third chance,

581
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:13,434
my second chance
was being here.

582
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:18,473
Okay, a third chance.
I want you back.

583
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:20,341
I don't deserve
a third chance.

584
00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:23,178
I'll take it.

585
00:26:27,616 --> 00:26:29,317
Hey.

586
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:33,254
Hey, um,
I want to talk to you,

587
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:35,356
but I have to go to the
counselor's office immediately.

588
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:38,293
I don't know what she wants, but she
said immediately, so I have to go.

589
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:41,496
No, you don't. I got that Joe guy
to give your teacher the note.

590
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,165
It cost me 20 bucks.

591
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,568
Really? So I don't have to go...
No.

592
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:49,237
I just got here
and I felt bad that

593
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:51,606
you dropped by and I had
something else going on,

594
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,541
but maybe you shouldn't
have dropped by.

595
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:55,476
I told you I'd talk to
you when I saw you.

596
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:57,278
Yet you have time
to talk to Adrian.

597
00:26:57,313 --> 00:26:58,546
At least that's
what she says.

598
00:26:58,581 --> 00:27:01,216
I did talk to her, Amy.
I told her what happened,

599
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,552
and I asked her to please not
call, or text, or email me again.

600
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:07,422
Oh, so she texts you
and emails you, too?

601
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:10,191
She's not just calling and
leaving you seductive messages?

602
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:12,193
You thought she'd call
but not text or email?

603
00:27:12,228 --> 00:27:13,561
No one emails!

604
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:16,197
Whatever. She won't do
any of that stuff again,

605
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:18,166
not that that
resolves our issues.

606
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,602
Yes, she will, she's
not going to give up.

607
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:23,538
You know, she's even going to try to
make you jealous by going out on a date.

608
00:27:23,572 --> 00:27:26,140
I know,
she texted me.

609
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:28,343
If I don't respond,
eventually she'll stop.

610
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:29,544
And have you responded?

611
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:31,579
I can't stop her.
I can only stop myself.

612
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:33,581
And I don't care who
she's going out with.

613
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:35,450
I mean, who's she
going out with? Ben?

614
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:38,253
No. Someone new.
Somebody that Grace's new boyfriend

615
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:39,354
is fixing her up with.

616
00:27:41,624 --> 00:27:43,458
I saw that.
Saw what?

617
00:27:43,492 --> 00:27:45,293
It does bother you.

618
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:47,428
You're going to go there again
after what I just said?

619
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:50,498
Are you ever going to believe me when
I say I'm not interested in Adrian,

620
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:53,568
or are you always going to be sneaking
around to see if you can catch me

621
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:56,337
picking up my phone or listening
in on my conversations

622
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:57,438
and all that stuff.

623
00:27:57,473 --> 00:27:59,374
Let me ask
you something, Ricky.

624
00:27:59,408 --> 00:28:03,244
You ever pick up my phone, check
my messages, my emails, my texts?

625
00:28:05,314 --> 00:28:08,516
Aha! So you've done the same thing
to me that I've done to you

626
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,285
only you
didn't get caught.

627
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,087
And there's nothing on my phone
that would even bother you.

628
00:28:13,122 --> 00:28:15,156
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

629
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,393
We just can't trust each other.
Why even try?

630
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,587
This isn't what I wanted
to be doing tonight.

631
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:33,526
Well, she's on
the way over, so...

632
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:36,362
So what? I just got finished
with my last final,

633
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:40,400
and I was just going to see if you
want to come over and celebrate.

634
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:43,436
Sure. But the more,
the merrier, right?

635
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:47,440
Grace, come on. Tell her I couldn't
get in touch with him,

636
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,510
tell her he has
a girlfriend or something.

637
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:52,445
But that would be a lie.

638
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,783
Well, kind of. Come on,
I promise. I'll find her a date.

639
00:28:56,817 --> 00:29:00,386
No. It has to be the date I found.
It has to be...

640
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:01,454
What's his name?

641
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,523
Dante?
<i>Yes, Dante.</i>

642
00:29:03,557 --> 00:29:06,493
Just come over, we'll talk
about it, we'll talk to him,

643
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:09,729
see if he's even interested and
we can get a little alone time.

644
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:13,399
Okay.
Okay, then.

645
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:16,336
<i>I'll just ask Adrian to drop me</i>
<i>off so you can drive me home.</i>

646
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,472
And if he happens to be at your
apartment when she drops me off, then,

647
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,474
that would be great.

648
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:28,515
It's T-bone. He'll come over for that.
You can thank me later.

649
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:31,351
Wait, what? No.
I don't want him to come over.

650
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:32,585
You've been wanting him
to come over all week.

651
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,354
Nora brought home steaks
from the butcher shop

652
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:35,622
so you would have
a reason to call him.

653
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:36,656
Call him.

654
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,326
Come on, Ames,
I'm doing this for you.

655
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,561
No, you're not.
You're doing this

656
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:43,496
so I won't be annoyed with
you for looking at my phone.

657
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,764
I'm not gonna call him.

658
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,433
He has looked at your phone,
hasn't he? You asked him?

659
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:50,637
Yeah, I asked him,
and no, he hasn't,

660
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:52,705
so thanks for the
suggestion.

661
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,675
Oh, he's just not admitting it.
I'm going to call him.

662
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:57,777
You may not be crying
now, but I know you,

663
00:29:57,812 --> 00:30:00,480
and there's going to be crying until
we get this whole thing wrapped up,

664
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:02,749
so just call him.

665
00:30:02,783 --> 00:30:06,352
By the way, did you tell Mom
that Nora is living here

666
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,521
or am I just supposed
to be hiding that?

667
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,557
Why would I tell Mom
that Nora is living here?

668
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:12,458
Because she owns the
house.

669
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:13,693
I have the house until you and
Ashley graduate high school,

670
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:15,428
and I'm done raising you.

671
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,832
There better be something funny
in that textbook, young lady.

672
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:21,534
There isn't.

673
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,802
Then what's so funny, that
I'm raising you and Ashley?

674
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:26,439
Dad, do you even know
where Ashley is?

675
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:27,607
Yes, I know
where Ashley is.

676
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:28,808
I talk to her every day.
And we text.

677
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:31,811
We text and text and text.
You can check my phone.

678
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:33,313
And where is she?

679
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:34,614
She's in Florida.

680
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:36,482
No, I knew that, I meant
where is she tonight?

681
00:30:36,517 --> 00:30:38,451
She and her friend are
starting a new job tonight.

682
00:30:38,485 --> 00:30:40,453
Uh-huh.
What kind of job?

683
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:42,555
Some sort of
medical assistant.

684
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,694
Yeah, what is Ashley qualified to
assist with in the medical field?

685
00:30:47,728 --> 00:30:50,763
I don't know, I didn't hire her,
but she's a very smart girl.

686
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,534
Mmm-hmm. Smart enough
to get out of this house.

687
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:56,469
I thought
you liked the house.

688
00:30:56,503 --> 00:30:58,338
You liked the house when
it was you and Ricky here.

689
00:30:58,372 --> 00:30:59,505
What is it you don't
like about it now?

690
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:05,712
Oh, of course, me.

691
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:07,480
I've gotten that before.

692
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,824
Ashley, this experimental
test program is for people

693
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:20,560
who have depression.
I'm not depressed.

694
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:21,828
I've been
depressed before.

695
00:31:21,862 --> 00:31:23,696
You're jaded,
not depressed.

696
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:27,500
Well, they're paying $500.
I could be depressed for $500.

697
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:28,668
I guess I could be, too.

698
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:30,436
Let's at least find out
what it's about.

699
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,608
"This medication could
cause irregular heartbeat,

700
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,678
"liver failure or could
even result in death..."

701
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,684
I'm out.

702
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:49,622
Feeling better.

703
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,460
Ta-da!

704
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:57,463
We walked
all around the block.

705
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,366
I mean, the entire block.

706
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:04,404
And John let me
hold his hand... Well...

707
00:32:04,738 --> 00:32:06,572
Hey, buddy.

708
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:09,642
It's been such a good day for me.
I'm so happy.

709
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:13,379
I've got a place to live
and a new job,

710
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:17,450
and you and John,

711
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,552
and your dad,

712
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:22,655
and Ricky.

713
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,358
Can't we call Ricky?

714
00:32:25,392 --> 00:32:26,459
Can't we please, Amy?

715
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:27,627
Hi, Daddy.

716
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:33,333
No, no! He doesn't trust me
and I don't trust him, and...

717
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:34,701
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

718
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:37,704
Or even a third.
That's what Leo says.

719
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:40,473
Even if I call Ricky, it doesn't
mean he's going to come over here.

720
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:42,642
You won't know
until you try.

721
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:45,445
Why don't you call him?
It's your celebration.

722
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:49,749
I don't want
to wait outside,

723
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:51,784
I don't want to
play games, okay?

724
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:55,521
Hey, John,
good to see you, buddy.

725
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,391
Why don't you get Grandma to
play with you and Moose outside?

726
00:32:58,425 --> 00:32:59,425
Okay.

727
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:17,643
I lied.
I've looked at your phone before.

728
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:19,345
A couple of times.

729
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,813
Not that it was worth
compromising my integrity for

730
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:24,584
by looking at it
or lying about it.

731
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:27,553
But I guess we were both wrong
not to trust each other.

732
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,590
I just don't know how we do that if
we really don't trust each other.

733
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,625
You don't trust me?

734
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:34,727
That's just an excuse for not
wanting to be with me, Ricky.

735
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,729
You know you can trust me.

736
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,499
You know what?
You can just go home, okay?

737
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:42,301
You don't get a T-bone steak
for this conversation.

738
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:44,604
You can go home, and you can try and
figure out how we can live together,

739
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:46,606
and still not be perfect.
Good night.

740
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,374
Oh, no,
I'm getting a steak.

741
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:50,576
I might eat it outside,
but I'm getting a steak.

742
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,353
So?

743
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:02,321
So it went nowhere.
She wants me to go home.

744
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:04,457
But I'm hungry.
And you invited me to eat,

745
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:06,426
so I'm eating,
then I'll leave.

746
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,693
You know what
the problem is?

747
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:09,462
The problem is
you're not married.

748
00:34:09,496 --> 00:34:11,731
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe your
problem is you're not married.

749
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:13,599
Both parties have to want to
be married to be married.

750
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,401
My ex-wife does not
want to be married.

751
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:16,469
Does your girlfriend
want to be married?

752
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,539
Do you want to be married?

753
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:20,640
I just want to eat.

754
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:23,609
Yes. Just not now.

755
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,579
I know, I know.

756
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:33,543
Well...
There's always going to be children

757
00:34:33,578 --> 00:34:35,379
who need your help,

758
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:37,314
and you're always going to want
to help them, so...

759
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:38,415
What can I say?

760
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,286
Well, you can say no.
I can even say no.

761
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:46,223
Since when, Margaret?
You're you.

762
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:47,324
Should we go get him?

763
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,360
Well, we can't
just go and get him.

764
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:52,462
Unfortunately,
he has to go to court.

765
00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:55,232
Until then,
he's gonna be in juvie.

766
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,200
Now, Ruben's trying
to work a deal.

767
00:34:57,235 --> 00:34:58,368
This is a serious offense,

768
00:34:58,403 --> 00:34:59,436
you can't send just go

769
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,339
sending naked pictures
of people around,

770
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:04,441
unless you're
both over 18,

771
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:06,476
and then apparently
it's not a legal issue.

772
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:08,345
But it should be.

773
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,314
Maybe, maybe not.

774
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,418
You text me a picture and
I'll text you one.

775
00:35:15,586 --> 00:35:17,220
Is that a yes?

776
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:21,358
Nice ring.

777
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:24,428
Oh, yeah.
It was my engagement ring.

778
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:26,396
Oh, no.

779
00:35:26,431 --> 00:35:27,331
What, you're engaged?

780
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:28,365
Well, right now, I'm
married.

781
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,367
Interesting.

782
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:33,403
Yeah, he just moved out.

783
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,305
But you're still married?

784
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,108
Yeah.
Well, we're getting a divorce.

785
00:35:38,142 --> 00:35:39,276
So, you...

786
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,144
Don't have children.

787
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:42,279
You guys want
something to eat or...

788
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:43,413
You're still in
high school, right?

789
00:35:43,448 --> 00:35:46,116
Yeah, but I'm a year
older than Grace.

790
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,217
I'm graduating
after summer school

791
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:48,352
and then
I'm going to college.

792
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:51,488
So why the divorce?

793
00:35:51,522 --> 00:35:55,192
Well, I'm kind of in love
with my old boyfriend,

794
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:56,326
but he and this girl
had a baby

795
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:58,261
and they were
living together,

796
00:35:58,296 --> 00:36:03,266
but they just split up and I think I
might want to try being with him again.

797
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:05,135
Uh-huh.

798
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:07,270
Maybe we should have given
them both a list of topics.

799
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:08,505
I don't think she
actually dated that much.

800
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:12,309
You know what,
I like your honesty.

801
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:15,145
I really do.

802
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:17,347
But if you're trying to get
back with your old boyfriend,

803
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:19,149
what are you
doing here with me?

804
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:21,184
Uh, I don't know.

805
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:24,521
I thought it would
make him jealous,

806
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,391
and I was curious.

807
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:30,060
About?

808
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:32,062
About whether or not Grace
actually knows any hot guys,

809
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,363
besides that one.

810
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:35,232
You know you can tell what
a person thinks about you

811
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:37,200
by who they try
to fix you up with?

812
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:39,236
You think so?
Yeah, I think so.

813
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,271
All right, well, um,

814
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:44,207
what do you think
people think about you?

815
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:45,308
Well, they think
I'm good looking,

816
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:48,278
because you're good looking.
Hmm?

817
00:36:48,312 --> 00:36:51,248
And they think I'm smart,
because you're smart,

818
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,451
and they think I'm sexy,

819
00:36:54,485 --> 00:36:57,320
because, uh,
well, you are sexy.

820
00:36:59,223 --> 00:37:01,224
You know what, your
self-esteem is pretty high

821
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,326
for someone going through a
divorce so early in life.

822
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:05,328
Yeah, it is.

823
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:08,298
That's why even though my old boyfriend
and this girl have a baby together,

824
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:11,134
I still think
I can get him back.

825
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:15,272
Not that I'm totally sure
I want him back.

826
00:37:15,306 --> 00:37:17,407
She'd take him away
from Amy just to see?

827
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:19,342
We're trying to have
a conversation here.

828
00:37:20,378 --> 00:37:22,379
So, what's your story?

829
00:37:24,382 --> 00:37:26,550
Well, I've been
married three times

830
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:30,220
and I got nine kids.

831
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,256
Really?
No, I'm playing.

832
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:34,458
I don't have nine kids.

833
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:36,159
I was just trying
to top your story.

834
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:37,360
Oh, yeah,
that's difficult to do.

835
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:40,464
Yeah. Uh, no, actually, I'm
a sophomore in college,

836
00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:42,265
my brother's a senior.

837
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,269
We live upstairs and I
got a full scholarship.

838
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:48,405
The wildest thing
I've ever done?

839
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:51,208
I don't know,
a couple of tattoos.

840
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:53,276
Oh, I'd like
to get a tattoo.

841
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:55,212
Tonight?
No!

842
00:37:55,246 --> 00:37:58,281
No, I don't even have one picked
out yet, or a place to get it.

843
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:00,183
Oh, 'cause, I an, I was going
to take you to my guy.

844
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:03,086
He does some really,
really good work.

845
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:05,155
Oh, um, when I said
I don't have a place,

846
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:07,324
uh, I meant on me.

847
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:08,492
I don't know
where I'd put one.

848
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,095
Oh, uh,

849
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,232
well, uh, how about
we get up out of here,

850
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:17,200
so I can get a better look
at the canvas, huh?

851
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:19,169
All right.

852
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:24,207
You guys,
tattoos last a lifetime!

853
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:29,246
Nice work, Grace.

854
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,082
At least it'll keep her
away from Ricky.

855
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:34,251
Amy and Ricky
got into a big fight.

856
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:36,253
Amy checked his phone out
and he caught her.

857
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:40,257
Really? You can check
my phone out any time you want.

858
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:44,194
No, it's okay,
I trust you.

859
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:45,295
Do you?

860
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:47,264
Or do you just not want
me to see your phone?

861
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:50,200
No!

862
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:54,171
No, you can see my phone,
if you really want to.

863
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:55,438
It's okay with me.

864
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:08,318
It's no one.

865
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:12,455
Tell no one I said hi.

866
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,359
It's Ethan. He's stuck in some juvie
hall room with some other idiot.

867
00:39:16,394 --> 00:39:18,295
All right, can we just
talk about this?

868
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:20,263
Yeah, I've been trying to
talk to you for a week now.

869
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:24,334
Yeah, I let this go on
way too long because,

870
00:39:24,368 --> 00:39:26,236
Amy, all my life,
no one has trusted me,

871
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,206
and all my life
I wasn't trustworthy.

872
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,208
I think I've earned
the right to be trusted.

873
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:32,475
It would be easier for
me to trust you, Ricky,

874
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,145
if you had just said, "Hey, you
want to listen to this message

875
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:36,446
"I just got from Adrian?"

876
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,049
instead of not saying anything or
saying you had listened to it,

877
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,384
and then you erased it.
That was a lie.

878
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:43,220
Yeah, I guess it was.

879
00:39:43,254 --> 00:39:45,255
And I shouldn't
have talked to her at all.

880
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:47,157
I should have told you
when I heard from her

881
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:49,192
and when I called her
back to talk to her.

882
00:39:49,227 --> 00:39:51,294
I'm sorry. I apologize.

883
00:39:53,464 --> 00:39:57,234
And hello, you've lied to me
before and I still trust you.

884
00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:59,269
That was different.
How was it different?

885
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:02,339
I don't know.
Let me tell you.

886
00:40:03,307 --> 00:40:05,375
Because it was different.

887
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:10,146
Again, no one has ever
trusted me, other than you,

888
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:12,382
so when I got busted,
I felt humiliated,

889
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:16,286
and I hated myself for letting
you down and I felt unworthy,

890
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,321
and I just
couldn't say that.

891
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,224
It was easier to be angry.

892
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,262
I'm very comfortable angry
and being the victim.

893
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:27,330
It's a lifelong process
to change that.

894
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,268
Again, I'm sorry.

895
00:40:39,243 --> 00:40:40,277
I'm sorry, too.

896
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:44,414
And thank you for telling
me that, for apologizing.

897
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:51,388
Can we please, please go back
to the apartment now? Please?

898
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:57,093
Ethan.
Just wanted to thank me.

899
00:40:57,128 --> 00:40:58,261
Ethan again?

900
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:03,233
Oh, my God.

901
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:05,368
Wait, is this the photo that
he got in trouble with?

902
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:09,306
No, it's Adrian showing me where
she's going to get a tattoo.

903
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,143
Okay, sooner or later, we've got to
get a sense of humor about Adrian.

904
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:17,080
What's funny about her constantly,
relentlessly, trying to break us up?

905
00:41:17,114 --> 00:41:19,316
You left out nakedly.

906
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,351
She's crazy,
you know that?

907
00:41:21,385 --> 00:41:23,420
I know that.
And I'm all done with crazy.

908
00:41:25,423 --> 00:41:28,325
You know
I can be crazy too,

909
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:30,260
if that's what you want,

910
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:31,361
if that's what you like.

911
00:41:32,396 --> 00:41:33,363
I can.

912
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:36,232
If you're no
done with crazy,

913
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:39,269
let me be crazy for you,
don't go to Adrian.

914
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:42,172
Uh, you? Crazy?

915
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:45,141
Oh, yeah.
I can be plenty crazy.

916
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:51,181
In fact, why don't we, the two
of us, go get tattoos right now?

917
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:53,083
Of what?

918
00:41:53,117 --> 00:41:54,184
Wedding bands.

919
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:57,187
We're probably never
going to have real ones

920
00:41:57,221 --> 00:42:00,256
so let's go get fake ones
tattooed, that'll show Adrian.

921
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:04,060
You need a little more
practice at being crazy.

922
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:06,129
Maybe we'll start
