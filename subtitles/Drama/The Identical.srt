1
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,840
Now every time

2
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,880
You hit one more bump in the road

3
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,400
Feel the burden

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,320
Of another heavy load

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,760
Hit by the curves

6
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,521
Life's unexpected twists and turns

7
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,840
You feel your world is upside down

8
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,771
And you're tumblin', tumblin, tumblin'

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,000
So take a hold from deep within

10
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,880
And find your life once again

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,120
You better go down easy

12
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,000
You got a lot to learn

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,520
You better count your blessings

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,920
Or you're gonna crash and burn

15
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,040
It was another world, Alabama in 1935.

16
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,960
A harder world for sure.

17
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,760
Middle of the Depression.

18
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,640
Not a job to be found for 100 miles

19
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,520
once the cotton was in.

20
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,840
William and Helen Hemsley would
have been better advised

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,080
to wait before marrying
and starting a family.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,240
But as they usually do, love and passion

23
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,040
got in front of logic and patience.

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,360
And in obedience with the scripture,

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,360
the Hemsleys set about the business

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,320
of being fruitful and multiplying

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,280
and starting a whole new life
in the big city of Decatur.

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,800
Sir.

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,280
Say, I was wondering

30
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,280
if maybe you got any more work

31
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,520
a fellow could do around here...

32
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,600
No, we're done till seeding.

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,520
Sir, please.

34
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,880
We got a baby coming due
and there ain't no...

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,880
Son, I don't have anything.

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,162
There's nothing I can do for you.

37
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,284
William, honey. Meet your sons.

38
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,164
They're perfect, just like you.

39
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,880
Mr. William,

40
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,050
y'all got two fine looking boys here.

41
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,840
Tent revivals were a common occurrence

42
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,080
in the rural South in the Depression.

43
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,880
People needing healing, prayer,

44
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,920
and just some hope in a
poor and frightening time.

45
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,320
For William Hemsley,
all of these applied.

46
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,720
What should've been the
happiest day of his life

47
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,760
was quickly becoming
the most troublesome.

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,320
...we first begun

49
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,280
Reverend Reece Wade was
a traveling evangelist

50
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,960
out of middle Tennessee.

51
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,360
And his message this cold October night

52
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,000
would reach right into
William's troubled soul.

53
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,762
And it is here that our
story truly begins.

54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,080
Blacks and whites, Jews and Gentiles,

55
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,960
all equal in the eyes of the Lord.

56
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,000
All equal in the eyes of the Lord!

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,200
Amen.

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,400
And let us never forget.

59
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,160
Let us never forget the words

60
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,000
of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ,

61
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,560
who says it is truly more blessed
to give than to receive.

62
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,120
Amen.

63
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,211
It is truly more blessed
to give than to receive.

64
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,605
That's my precious wife Louise,
sitting right over here.

65
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,647
We miscarried again over Thanksgiving.

66
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,160
The doctor over in Birmingham

67
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,000
told us to stop trying,

68
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,920
or it might be her that goes.

69
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,880
And all the gifts He's given us,

70
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,287
that's the one we wanted most.

71
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,247
All of our dreams were of having a baby.

72
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,728
Family of our own...

73
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,489
love...

74
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,361
to take care of.

75
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,401
Maybe... maybe y'all could
pray for us tonight.

76
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,568
For our own miracle.

77
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,720
What?

78
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,840
Now, I know this sounds...

79
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,120
Crazy? Absolutely insane?

80
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,200
- Just listen to me.
- No, William.

81
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,040
Just listen!
We can't do it.

82
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,280
We can't even feed ourselves.
Now we got two more?

83
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,240
I'm not giving away my babies!

84
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,720
I'll work two jobs.
I'll work three!

85
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,080
Having a job is my job!
And there ain't none!

86
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,567
There ain't no work anywhere.

87
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,200
We're drowning.

88
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,051
We got nothing and no way to get along.

89
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,840
They'll take them away from
us if we can't feed them.

90
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,160
What if they get sick or
something happens to me?

91
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,840
You're going to raise two
babies mending dresses?

92
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,168
So you just give them both up?

93
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,600
One.

94
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,560
Now, we can make it with just one.

95
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,520
No, William Hemsley.

96
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,371
Nobody is taking my babies from me.

97
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,687
Never.

98
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,525
They're here.

99
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,042
All right.

100
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,600
Well, I'm sure you're all wondering

101
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,087
why I asked you out
here so urgent and all.

102
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,042
I heard you at the revival,
reverend, and...

103
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
it made me think.

104
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,400
And I was talking it
over here with my wife

105
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,400
and we want to ask you something.

106
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,960
Let me see if I can make
this a little easier.

107
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,360
The Bible says we're all
brothers and sisters in Christ.

108
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,520
Our job is to love and
look out for one another.

109
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,520
Now Louise and I prayed
and talked over this

110
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,080
and we want you to have a
love offering given to us.

111
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,680
Oh no.
Thank you but...

112
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,320
- Please take it.
- Take it.

113
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,680
No, thank you, but that's not
why we wanted to see you.

114
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,600
You see, Helen and I have
been praying ourselves

115
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,240
and we think God's give
us both some answers.

116
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,920
Now, we can give everything we got

117
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,200
to raise one child and that is it.

118
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,040
Maybe someone else,
like a man and woman of God,

119
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,320
could give the other
a life we never could.

120
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,488
No, no.

121
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,800
You're beautiful and blessed people

122
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,080
to even consider such a thing.

123
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,640
But you're just tired, honey,
and scared and emotional.

124
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,720
Times is hard for everybody.

125
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,920
No, we prayed on it like you say to do.

126
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,560
No, William. We can't.

127
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,360
You preached it, reverend.

128
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,000
It's better to give than receive.

129
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,440
You don't know this ain't
God answering your prayers.

130
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,400
Maybe He's got something special
in mind for one of our boys.

131
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,600
You see...

132
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,160
it's God we're really giving him to.

133
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,320
That's what the Lord wants.

134
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,091
We both know it.

135
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,687
And you both know it too.

136
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,606
The Lord will choose for you.

137
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,680
I'll love him good for both of us.

138
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,405
Thank you.

139
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,164
And God be with you, sister.

140
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,520
Dexter Ryan is not to know
until Helen and I pass.

141
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,529
Give me your word on that, pastor?

142
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,728
Yeah, you have my word.

143
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,200
I don't know what to say.

144
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,320
There's nothing to say.

145
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,204
He's God's now anyway.

146
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,048
Now, go.

147
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,160
It was not uncommon in
the 1930s to lose a baby.

148
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,640
There was a funeral for the child

149
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,320
they gave away the next day.

150
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,520
All William and Helen could afford

151
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,040
was a shoe box to bury him in.

152
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,608
Of course, only they
knew the box was empty.

153
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,520
And somewhere, on the road
to their new life as a family,

154
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,720
the Reverend Reece Wade
stole away with his new son

155
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,240
and dedicated him to
the creator of life itself,

156
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,761
the king of the universe.

157
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,800
Amen.

158
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,049
Ryan Reece Wade,
welcome to your new life.

159
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,000
Christ the Lord is ris'n today

160
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,480
Alleluia!

161
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,440
Raise your joys and triumphs high

162
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,680
Alleluia!

163
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,000
You'd almost say little Ryan Wade was

164
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,200
like any boy in the 1940s,
except for one thing.

165
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,280
When he sang a song,
he could bring the roof down.

166
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,120
Nehemiah, Esther, Psalms...

167
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,440
Job.

168
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,611
Job. Yeah, Job, Psalms...

169
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,920
- Proverbs?
- Proverbs...

170
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,487
How many books of the
Bible are there, Daddy?

171
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,560
You tell me. Sixty...

172
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,000
- 66.
- 66.

173
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,080
How many in the Old Testament?

174
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,600
- 39.
- 39.

175
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,640
You're on number 20 with Proverbs.

176
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,446
Now, come on.

177
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,520
And do not be conformed to this world,

178
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,480
but transformed by the
renewing of your mind.

179
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,040
That you may prove what
is good and acceptable,

180
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,605
the perfect will of God.

181
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,487
Jeremiah 29.

182
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,041
For I know the plans...

183
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,166
I have for you.

184
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,840
- Declares the Lord.
- Declares the Lord.

185
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,720
But when memorizing
proved to be a challenge,

186
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,520
Ryan knew instinctively

187
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,160
what every grade school teacher knows.

188
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,960
Turn it into a song.

189
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,680
Well

190
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:41,240
I know the plans I have for you

191
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,250
Declares the Lord

192
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,200
Plans to prosper and not to harm you

193
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,120
And then shall call and pray to me

194
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,400
And I will listen to ya

195
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,320
And ye shall seek and ye shall find

196
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,520
When you seek with all of your heart

197
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,560
Louise was smitten with the boy's gift.

198
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,240
Reece accepted it, but, in his view,

199
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,082
Ryan was set aside to follow in
his footsteps as a man of God.

200
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,720
...price to pay

201
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,800
She walks right in, she walks right out

202
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,200
She sing and dance, she jump and shout

203
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,600
Whoa, baby,
don't you just walk by me...

204
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,644
Am I the master of the fake ID or what?

205
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,247
Oh, no thank you.

206
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,320
Come on, man.
You can't be a PK forever.

207
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,760
PK?

208
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,560
PK. Preacher's Kid.
That's you.

209
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,480
"Please Lord,
never let me have any fun."

210
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,920
That's what I am, Dino. Besides...

211
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,160
I don't like beer.

212
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,601
More for me.

213
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,251
I like beer a lot.

214
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,320
Man! Are you listening to this?

215
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,840
Yeah.

216
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,120
Wow.

217
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,527
I ain't never heard
anything like it before.

218
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,320
How come we can't do music
like this back home?

219
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,920
In Tennessee, in your daddy's church?

220
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,440
Cat, you crazy.

221
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,840
I ain't talking about church, Dino.

222
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,930
I'm just talking about music.

223
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,960
She walk right in, she walk right out

224
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,840
A PK is always the wildest at heart.

225
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,760
Baby baby

226
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,486
Don't you just walk by me

227
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,720
it's 1:45 in the morning.

228
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,400
You been drinking, son?

229
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,960
No, sir.

230
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,400
Don't lie to me.

231
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,204
I ain't lying, Daddy.

232
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,840
You smell like smoke.

233
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,120
I wasn't smoking either.

234
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,320
Where you been?

235
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,640
At Dino's place.

236
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,171
Is that so?

237
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,720
I drove by Dino's when I
was out looking for you.

238
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,924
Must've just missed you.

239
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,760
I was at a roadhouse across County Line.

240
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,520
What?

241
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,800
Daddy, it ain't what you think.

242
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,600
A honky-tonk?

243
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, I knew if I told you,
you'd never let me go.

244
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,440
You're underage!

245
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,560
And you're going into the ministry.

246
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,640
I went to listen to some music, Daddy.

247
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,360
What did I do that's so wrong?

248
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,722
You didn't tell me the truth,
that's what.

249
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,840
Dance, dance, dance, everybody now

250
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,440
Dance, dance, dance

251
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,080
Everybody's doing it

252
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,960
It's boogie-woogie rock and roll

253
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,367
Yeah

254
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,960
Yeah, that's a good song, cuz.

255
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,320
Yeah, man.
We need more guys though.

256
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,920
Well, we need more everything.

257
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,480
Man, we get some guys in here.

258
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,560
I'll sing the songs, write the songs.

259
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,880
You play the drums.
It's all I want to do.

260
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,640
Hey, you call the tune, I'll play it.

261
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,411
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it, oh!

262
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,720
Forty years.

263
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,440
Forty years wandering the desert.

264
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,120
Looking for a sign.

265
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,000
Praying for an answer,

266
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,320
a direction.

267
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,568
But sometimes...

268
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,206
God's answer to His children...

269
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,089
is wait.

270
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,120
Hey, what's the rush?

271
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,800
You're sure your daddy's okay with this?

272
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,320
Oh, yeah, man, I take
his car all the time.

273
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,920
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

274
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,360
Oh no, he looks mad!

275
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,440
Get out! Get back here!

276
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,520
Get back here! Get back here!

277
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:47,960
You gotta get up, come on
You gotta get up, come on

278
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,400
Put on your dancin' feet

279
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,960
You gotta get up, come on

280
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,040
I've never seen anyone move like that.

281
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,160
He just don't care.

282
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,560
Now I grant you, it was a
tad odd on a first date

283
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,200
to visit a honky-tonk across the tracks.

284
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,760
But Ryan was unlike any
boy I had ever met.

285
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,280
Sweet and gentle, a gentleman
through and through.

286
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,600
When that music started,

287
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,043
it was like a fire erupted
in that heart of his.

288
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,926
You're so pretty in your face.

289
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,280
I was wondering if
you'd ever ask me out.

290
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,360
What took you so long, anyway?

291
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,680
I was afraid you'd say no.

292
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,689
Well, I didn't, did I?

293
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,560
No, you didn't.

294
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,320
Hey, girl, you can really do this.

295
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,560
Well, I should say
the same thing of you.

296
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,160
Where did a preacher's kid learn
to dance the way that you do?

297
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,480
Oh, well I don't know.

298
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,524
Something just happens
to me when I hear music.

299
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,120
You know, whatever it is,

300
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,687
it's a good thing, Ryan Wade.

301
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,320
Hey. You better keep them pipes warm.

302
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,364
This party's just getting started.

303
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,800
That was nice.

304
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,800
Maybe we can do this again sometime.

305
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,800
I would like that, Ryan Wade.

306
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,560
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
please have your attention.

307
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,600
For our next number,
we'd like to bring up

308
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,880
a very special guest.

309
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,600
Now it appears we have a
very talented young man

310
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,600
in our midst tonight.

311
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,840
And the rumor is dude
can really bring it on home.

312
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,440
Well, let's just see.

313
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,080
Please welcome the man with
all those dance moves,

314
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,920
Mr. Ryan Wade.

315
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,400
There are many accounts
of how, when, and where

316
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,480
rock n' roll was actually born.

317
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,640
Now I'm not saying they're
wrong or anything,

318
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,080
But I believe part of that birth

319
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,800
happened on this very night in
little old Lebanon, Tennessee.

320
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,520
Is this you?

321
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,520
We've got the tune from
Little Drummer Boy.

322
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,529
You lead, we'll follow.

323
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,920
Give me a song, Mr. Music Man

324
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,120
Want to hear your rockin' band

325
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,680
Play it loud, don't you play it sweet

326
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,080
I got a feelin' in my feet

327
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,960
Boogie-woogie rock 'n roll

328
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,760
Guitar picking with a lot of soul

329
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,000
Everybody's doing it

330
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,280
It's boogie-woogie rock 'n roll

331
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,720
Boogie-woogie rock 'n roll

332
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,760
Guitar picking with a lot of soul

333
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,480
Call it whatever you like

334
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,840
It's boogie-woogie rock 'n roll

335
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,720
Dance, dance, dance, everybody now

336
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,640
Dance, dance, dance

337
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,360
Dance, dance, dance, everybody now

338
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,200
Dance, dance, dance

339
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,760
Everybody's doing it

340
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,960
It's boogie-woogie rock 'n roll

341
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,571
Yeah

342
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,240
Boogie-woogie rock n' roll

343
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,480
Guitar pickin' with a lot of soul

344
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,763
Well, well, well, well.
Look at what we have here.

345
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,920
Wesley, I thought you said this was just

346
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,009
a grand theft auto call.

347
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,400
Son, you can either
go to jail or go home.

348
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,127
After talking to your daddy,
I'd choose jail.

349
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,681
Get that, punk.

350
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,320
This place is starting to match my mood.

351
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,240
Dark and stinky.

352
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,000
You smell that, Wesley?

353
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,520
That's hootie weed.
They're reefers.

354
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,280
Serving alcohol to minors...

355
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,120
and a preacher's boy,
bringing the devil music.

356
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,961
Get down off that stage, boy.
Get down off that stage!

357
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,440
Boy, you know we don't go
for that kind of music.

358
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,802
You understand me?

359
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,480
Do you understand me?

360
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,080
There ain't nothing
wrong with this music.

361
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,568
There ain't nothing wrong
with these people.

362
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,600
There seems to be a
little misunderstanding

363
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,480
of the law around here.

364
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,200
Are we clear?

365
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,600
Wesley, shut this place down!

366
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,360
Get out of here!

367
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,369
Now!

368
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,440
I had to give him the taste
of the back of my hand.

369
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,320
- Did you now?
- Yeah, I did.

370
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,440
He didn't like it too much either.

371
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,840
He almost came after me.

372
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,400
- He did what?
- He almost came after me.

373
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,200
Sir, this will be taken
care of, I promise you.

374
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,960
I don't know what he thinks about

375
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,360
bringing minors into a honky-tonk.

376
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,720
Just make sure it don't happen again.

377
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,120
I am truly sorry.

378
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,890
Sorry, buddy.

379
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,520
Get out of the car.

380
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,041
I said get out of the car.

381
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,608
- Thank you, sheriff.
- Y'all take care.

382
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,920
What do you think I should
preach on tomorrow?

383
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,880
Turn the other cheek?
Eye for an eye?

384
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,520
Why don't you preach the sermon for me?

385
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,840
Maybe sing a little song.

386
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,640
I didn't do anything...

387
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,120
You're lucky he didn't
throw you in jail, boy.

388
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,880
I didn't do anything wrong, Daddy.

389
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,720
Come on. You didn't do anything right!

390
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,600
I told you never to step
foot in that place again.

391
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,480
How's that for starters?

392
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,720
And you're dragging two
underage girls with you?

393
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,800
Mouthing off to the sheriff?

394
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,360
He's a redneck. And he's
picking on these people, Daddy.

395
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,160
I do know that!
But that's not your fight.

396
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,283
Not yet.

397
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,640
This little musical tour
of yours, it's over.

398
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,400
It's time for an apology tour,

399
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,880
starting with your mother
who's worried sick.

400
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,360
And tomorrow,
you're apologizing to the church,

401
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,680
most of whom have called
the house already tonight.

402
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,040
And on Monday, you and I
are driving to Nashville

403
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,891
and you're joining the army, boy.

404
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,320
You are my son, Ryan Wade,

405
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,720
and I love you more than
you will ever know.

406
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,881
But it's time for you to
grow up and be a man.

407
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,680
I wasn't sure if I would
ever see Ryan Wade again.

408
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,920
His daddy thought it was time for Ryan

409
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,760
to grow up and be a man.

410
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,040
And Uncle Sam set about the task

411
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,289
of turning Ryan Wade into that man.

412
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,960
She's lookin' so fine
in her high heel shoes

413
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,400
You better look out,
she'll give you the blues

414
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,480
You better think twice
when she walks your way

415
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,162
To be with her there's a price to pay

416
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,360
Attention!

417
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,840
I don't believe what I'm seeing!

418
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,960
I have five vehicles down,
one trailer that needs an axle,

419
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,920
and a jeep that needs an oil change,

420
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,800
and you knuckleheads decide to

421
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,680
do a private concert in my motor pool!

422
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,720
Lock it up.

423
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,160
Private Wade, this is your new job,
serenading my motor pool?

424
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,720
Sir, no, sir.

425
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,040
Well, while we're on the subject,

426
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,800
I got a question for you.

427
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,082
Where'd you learn to
sing like that, boy?

428
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,050
Let's hear another one.

429
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,000
As you were!

430
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,600
Only fate, DNA, or the good Lord Himself

431
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,000
seemed to have other plans
for Private Ryan Wade.

432
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,880
All right boys, let's do it.

433
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,520
Ryan sang his way through
two years in the army,

434
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,840
developing his raw talents into
a world class singing voice,

435
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,720
having not a clue
that over in Nashville,

436
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,520
a young man by the name of Drexel Hemsley

437
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,520
was on a similar,
if less structured, path.

438
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:41,120
Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go

439
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,120
Beboppin' baby, shake, a rock 'n roll

440
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:52,160
You can ask her to dance,
but she don't wanna dance slow

441
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,410
Beboppin' baby, girl,
you got me in a spin...

442
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,760
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

443
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,560
This is Dr. Ralph Jennings,

444
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,760
president of the
Southeastern Bible College.

445
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,600
Your father tells me you got a mind
to follow in his footsteps someday.

446
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,400
And if you perceive the
same call that he did,

447
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,160
there's always a spot for you there.

448
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,125
See, what did I tell you, son?

449
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,960
And the Lord told Jonah to go to Nineveh
and warn them of impending judgment.

450
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,360
The problem is, Jonah wasn't listening,

451
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,400
and a certain fish was waiting

452
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,685
when he decided to run away from God.

453
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,040
Honey, what is it?

454
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,004
It's a good thing you're sitting down.

455
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,085
Okay, so?

456
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,160
Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go

457
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,524
Drexel Hemsley.
Drexel Hemsley!

458
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,400
Oh, Ryan cannot hear this.

459
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,080
I don't think that's possible.

460
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,083
- Why?
- It's in every storefront in town.

461
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,165
How it do?

462
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,080
Girl, slow down,
I want to get to know ya

463
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,520
I know that I can show ya

464
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,720
Who is this?

465
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,606
Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go

466
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,760
Beboppin' baby, shake, rock 'n roll

467
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,320
How many times can that
boy play the same song?

468
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,960
Apparently as many times as

469
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,760
Jesus taught Peter we are to forgive.

470
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,520
It's a fad.

471
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,680
These things never last.

472
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,089
Oh my Lord!

473
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,960
What's that?

474
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,640
That there is the carb, Daddy.

475
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,720
A what? A carb?

476
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,920
A valve shot.

477
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,280
On the carb?

478
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,120
Yeah, you need...
you need a new one.

479
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,360
Okay.

480
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,520
It ain't the first time.

481
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,160
What's it do?

482
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,960
Feeds fuel to the engine.

483
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,008
You got some bad jets.

484
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,960
You learned about cars in the army?

485
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,760
No, sir, always messed
with 'em. You know that.

486
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,840
I've never seen you take
one of these thingies out.

487
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,247
That's something new.

488
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,043
How you doing, son?

489
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,800
I'm okay.

490
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,400
Figuring it out, I guess.

491
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,680
I don't think we ever
really do figure it out.

492
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,480
That's God's job.

493
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,560
Our job is to be who He made us to be

494
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,082
and to do what He calls us to do.

495
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,040
That's the preacher talking.

496
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,280
Your dad here,

497
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,040
I'm mighty proud of you, son.

498
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,920
For hearing the calling

499
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,840
and staying obedient to it.

500
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,691
Come on, let's get something to eat.

501
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,920
Hello there!

502
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,442
Hello. Can you hold on a sec?
I just got this bolt.

503
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,960
Oh, boy.

504
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,240
Does that boy have 24
carat pipes or what!

505
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,568
Oh, man!

506
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,680
You're a fan, I see.

507
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,245
Oh yeah.

508
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,520
Are you guys related or something?

509
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,040
You're a dead ringer for him.

510
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,840
I know. I hear it all the time but no.

511
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,000
Not related, nothing.

512
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,680
Avi Hirshberg of the
Brooklyn Hirshbergs.

513
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,560
Don't let the cowboy accent fool you.

514
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,520
It's just good for business.

515
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,120
Gotcha. Ryan Wade.

516
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,920
Well, how do you do, Mr. Wade.

517
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,160
How can I help you?

518
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,200
Valve shot on this carb.

519
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,720
Yeah.

520
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,640
I think it's past rebuilding.

521
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,480
Oh no, I'm gonna have to
order a new one, I think.

522
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,480
Where... where'd you pull this out of?

523
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,280
Flat Head Six.

524
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,240
All right. Sounds like you
know your way around cars.

525
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,440
I know enough to know when I
need to go to a real mechanic.

526
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,530
Want a job?

527
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,560
- No, thanks.
- No, really.

528
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,640
I got one.
I go to school too.

529
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,360
Oh come on, work with me.

530
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,680
We'll be hanging around
fixing carburetors,

531
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,520
singing along with Drexel.

532
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,160
I even do barbecue Fridays.

533
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,320
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you $10 a week

534
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,000
and all you can eat.

535
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,560
That sounds tempting but no, thanks.

536
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,320
All right, it's too bad.

537
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,920
All right, tell you what,
you come around Wednesday,

538
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,080
I should have it done.

539
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,320
Wednesday?

540
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,600
- Yeah.
- All right.

541
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,643
I'll see you then.
Thank you.

542
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,004
I can't get over how
much you look like him.

543
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,720
Good morning, Mrs. Carter.

544
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,120
Good morning.

545
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,163
There you go.
Sign here for me.

546
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,411
Ladies.

547
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,123
Thank you.

548
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:25,520
Your love's keeping me tonight

549
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,931
Even when we're far away

550
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:41,360
Your love's keeping me tonight

551
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,841
Until the morning brings another day

552
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

553
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,160
I just want everyone to know
this is a fine young man,

554
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,640
and that song he just sang,
that's his mother's favorite.

555
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,080
Yes sir, it is.

556
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,280
How about that everybody?

557
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,240
That was nice.

558
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,880
That's our show.
We'll see you next week.

559
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,481
You know, I can see right inside of him.

560
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,320
I know what he's thinking.

561
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,320
I know what he's going to say.

562
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,285
I even know what his next
dance move is going to be.

563
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,400
I may just be crazy.

564
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,200
Mama, I can't do this anymore.

565
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,920
Do what?

566
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,600
I don't hear this call
Daddy wants me to hear.

567
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,520
It ain't there.

568
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,920
Took you long enough to figure that out.

569
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,120
So, Mama, what's the point
of me going to school

570
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,846
for a call I don't hear?

571
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,800
I still go out to Nashville,

572
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,128
places y'all wouldn't approve of.

573
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,760
Just to hear real music getting played.

574
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,920
I hurt so bad Mama because...

575
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,248
it's the only call I hear.

576
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,128
When do you plan to tell your daddy?

577
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,320
Maybe you can tell him for me.

578
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,440
No.

579
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,560
Reece Ryan Wade, no chance.

580
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,840
It's a man's job learning
to stand in his truth.

581
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,200
I hope if we have taught you anything

582
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,120
it's that the love of God seeks us

583
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,400
in every situation and desires our good.

584
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,685
If He is in your dreams,
nothing can stand against 'em.

585
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,160
What?

586
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,442
This ain't the call for me.

587
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,880
But you got the gift.

588
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,280
Everyone, your teacher says so.

589
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,721
But not me, Daddy.

590
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,280
Ryan, the worst mistakes we make

591
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,240
are the decisions that
are made in haste,

592
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,640
you understand?

593
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,080
Let's just slow it down here
and finish the school year...

594
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,887
Daddy, Daddy.
I've already withdrawn.

595
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,800
Ryan, you dropped out of school?

596
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,082
I dropped out yesterday.

597
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,365
Daddy, I...

598
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,245
Ryan...

599
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,288
I don't know what to say.

600
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,800
Okay.

601
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,641
Well, this is your life.

602
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,249
You're a man now, I guess.

603
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,640
What... what's your plan?

604
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,480
What are you going to do?

605
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,560
Want to live for a while,
be me for once.

606
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,960
And you haven't been yourself,

607
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,120
is that what you're saying?

608
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,560
I'm not going to subsidize this.

609
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,920
You understand that, right?

610
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,124
I didn't expect you to.

611
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,440
I found an apartment off the square.

612
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,320
Okay, I guess you
got it all figured out.

613
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,284
I'm sorry.

614
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,040
I'm just trying to be
what He made me to be,

615
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,527
not something else.

616
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,371
You're breaking my heart, boy.

617
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,485
Sign here please.

618
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,760
Jenny?

619
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,841
Heh.

620
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,800
Anybody ever tell you you look
just like Drexel Hemsley?

621
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,880
Yes, Miss.

622
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,440
I have heard that before.

623
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,640
I thought you was him.
His mama right upstairs...

624
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,560
Cheryl! You didn't hear that, okay?

625
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,722
It's supposed to be a secret,
for obvious reasons.

626
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,560
Hello, Ryan.

627
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,560
So you're a nurse.

628
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,127
Yeah, I am.

629
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,528
How was the army?

630
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,730
It was fine.

631
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,960
Hey...

632
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,440
would you maybe want to
get together sometime,

633
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,840
grab a cup of coffee or something?

634
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,600
Oh I...

635
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,880
Sorry, I'm kind of seeing somebody.

636
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,606
Well, it's okay.

637
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,000
It's good to see you, Ryan.

638
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,329
It's really good to see you, Jenny.

639
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,680
You look great.

640
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,405
Thanks.

641
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,968
Father...

642
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,490
bless this dear lady.

643
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,724
Hello.

644
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,760
Your son, his music means a lot to me,

645
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,640
and I just wanted to see you,

646
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,571
say a little prayer.

647
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,207
I'll just go. It's okay.

648
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:14,449
I can see your picture in my mind

649
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:23,600
A vision that seems so very real

650
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:31,000
I miss you every night in my dreams

651
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:38,000
Time and space never keep us apart

652
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,880
Your love's keeping me tonight

653
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:47,484
Even when we're far away

654
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,362
Dexter.

655
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,760
I didn't know then.
But I know now.

656
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:32,040
That something inside
of Ryan died that day.

657
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:39,000
I can see your picture in my mind

658
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:46,800
A vision that seems so very real

659
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:55,044
I miss you every night in my dreams

660
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,400
You still hiring?

661
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,920
I thought you had a job?

662
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,720
I think I'd rather work here.

663
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,680
Well, thinking is what got you here.

664
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,000
Why don't you go in the
car and start her up.

665
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,771
You started five minutes ago.

666
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,800
They're beautiful, Ryan.
Thank you.

667
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,800
It was great to see you too.

668
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,360
But like I said, I'm seeing someone.

669
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,280
I mean, I'm... sorry.

670
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,200
You take care though, okay?

671
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,280
Yeah. Bye.

672
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,290
Okay, bye.

673
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,760
The boy that sent you the flowers?

674
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,440
Yup.

675
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,600
The one who looked as good
as Drexel Hemsley himself

676
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,080
just asked you out?

677
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,760
And he's your old boyfriend?

678
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,440
Well, we went out once.

679
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,360
Six years ago, but it was a doozy.

680
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,800
How you going to get to know him again

681
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,760
if you don't go out on a date?

682
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,840
Well, who says I want to
get to know him again?

683
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,327
Your eyes, girl, that's who.

684
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,000
Oh, why so verklempt, man?

685
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,160
She said no.

686
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,640
Man. You sent her flowers, right?

687
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,320
Just like you told me.

688
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,520
And the card.
What'd the card say?

689
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,360
From me.

690
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,240
No man. You got to say
stuff like, "I miss you.

691
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,720
"Give me a second chance.
Roses are red. I love you.

692
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,800
I long to be with you."

693
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,800
She's got a boyfriend.

694
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,360
It don't matter. You need to
make her laugh, make her smile.

695
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,080
Girls don't get the
attention they deserve.

696
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,760
You've got to pump up
the volume, or walk away.

697
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,200
It's not time to lower your standards.

698
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,480
It's time to up them.

699
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,444
What am I supposed to do?

700
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,040
Angel of my life

701
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,000
My loving angel

702
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:26,680
You're all I need

703
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:34,760
You came into my life when I was alone

704
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,680
Made me believe I wasn't low

705
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,000
I wasn't low

706
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,280
Made me believe

707
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,640
Angel of my life

708
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,200
My loving angel

709
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,160
You're like a dream

710
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,840
Just like a dream

711
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:00,720
But here you are, and you are real

712
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,960
I'm loving you

713
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,920
Loving you

714
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,360
Loving me

715
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,920
How did you find me?

716
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,040
Your friend...
Cheryl helped a little bit.

717
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,640
I'm going to kill her.

718
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,040
Coffee. Just a cup of coffee.

719
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,440
Look. I know a lot of songs,

720
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,600
and I'll sing every one
of them, until you say yes.

721
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,280
Kid the jig's up.
Here comes the heat.

722
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,280
Might this be the
disturbing the peace call?

723
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,280
You called the cops on me?

724
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,080
Oh, I didn't call them.

725
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,040
And why are there always police
involved with you and me?

726
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,160
Officer, look.
I ain't going anywhere,

727
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,240
until this girl agrees to
go out on a date with me

728
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,840
or you arrest me.

729
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,840
I have a boyfriend!

730
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,120
Then where is he?
Because he ain't here,

731
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,440
and he ain't the one singing
you love songs tonight.

732
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,040
Miss, just a cup of joe with the boy.

733
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,401
What would it hurt?

734
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,960
Sorry, pal, let's go!

735
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,520
Okay! Coffee. One cup.

736
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,800
But only if your backup singer
agrees to go with us.

737
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,721
Son, kiss the bride!

738
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,560
Well, let's just say that
was one good cup of coffee.

739
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,360
In August of 1960,

740
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,120
our lives began as
Mr. and Mrs. Ryan Wade.

741
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,040
And time marched on.

742
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,160
Ryan and I settled into a nice,
little small town routine,

743
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,000
and built our life together.

744
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,800
Ryan fixing cars with Avi,

745
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,720
pretending he'd found his calling.

746
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,520
Fun, fun, fun in the sun

747
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,560
Good vibrations everywhere

748
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:00,760
Dance, dance, dance in the sand

749
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,806
Sun's reflections, ocean tan

750
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,760
Girls and boys are everywhere

751
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,320
Sunrise surfin'

752
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,480
Love is floating in the air

753
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:25,844
Sunrise surfin'

754
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,560
It's 8:55 and 70 degrees.

755
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,280
The weather after the news.

756
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,360
The big news? War broke out in
the Middle East this morning.

757
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,240
It has spread now through

758
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,520
the Israeli port city of Haifa
on the Mediterranean.

759
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,640
Syria sent its planes to bomb
the Haifa oil refinery,

760
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,960
leaving it in flames.

761
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,840
Three Israeli planes were shot down

762
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,000
in a dogfight with Jordanian jets.

763
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,800
Three Syrian MiGs attacked
the city of Magneto.

764
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,160
In other news...

765
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,800
What does that have to do

766
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:00,280
with the Christian church
in the state of Tennessee?

767
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,160
Everything!

768
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,921
It has to do with everything!

769
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,920
We are commanded by the word of God,

770
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,920
to give him no rest from our prayers.

771
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:19,921
For who? Today, for Israel.

772
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,760
Our precious Lord and savior

773
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,804
was himself a Jew!

774
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,760
If we love God,

775
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,240
we must love what God loves.

776
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,280
And God loves his chosen people!

777
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,200
I've symbolically lit

778
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,480
the eight candles of
the Hanukkah menorah.

779
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:53,722
God's people need that
Hanukkah miracle again.

780
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,640
Israel won the war.
A modern day miracle.

781
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,960
But our miracle,
to have a family of our own,

782
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,680
apparently wasn't meant to be.

783
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,680
The doctors said Ryan
and I would never have

784
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,042
one of these precious gifts.

785
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,760
He just seems so directionless.

786
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,680
He needs something beyond
just making a living.

787
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,440
A calling perhaps?

788
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,680
It's time.

789
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,000
It's time to tell him the truth.

790
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:36,000
Every night, I see that man's face,

791
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,680
making me give my word

792
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,720
not to say anything

793
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,969
until they're both gone.

794
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:51,080
It's been a thorn in my
side for 31 years, mother.

795
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,080
I think about it.
Every day.

796
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,440
The truth shall set you free.

797
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,450
He has a right to know who he is.

798
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,240
Girls and boys are everywhere

799
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:13,960
Sunrise surfin'

800
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,840
Love is floating in the air

801
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:22,680
- Sunrise surfin'
- Are you sure about this?

802
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,440
I have never been so sure in my life.

803
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,960
I got a great, big love for you

804
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,160
You're one of a kind,
You're gonna be mine

805
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,491
It's the last thing I'm ever gonna do

806
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,280
Whoo!

807
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,520
I don't believe this.

808
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,880
Dino!

809
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,400
Ryan?

810
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,160
Ryan, my main man!
Pots and pans!

811
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,520
- What is shakin' bacon?
- Man, how are you?

812
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,720
I'm good man! And Jenny.

813
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,760
Aw man, if I only had me a Jenny,

814
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,280
I wouldn't be spending so
much money on alimony, huh?

815
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,320
How you been man?

816
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,040
Man I'm fine. I'm fine.
Is this your gig now?

817
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,160
Oh no. I just play where they pay.

818
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,640
I've been all over.
Florida, New Orleans. California.

819
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,960
Psychedelic sound's where it's at.

820
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,840
This is cool.

821
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,000
You're going to be backing
me up in a minute.

822
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,120
Son, that's going to be
like shooting fish in a barrel.

823
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,080
- You serious?
- Just for fun man.

824
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,960
You know it's all her idea.

825
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,600
I'll lay you down a beat, right?

826
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,560
You just do what you do.
Just like old times.

827
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,048
Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go

828
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,441
Beboppin' baby, shake, a rock 'n roll

829
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,121
You can ask her to dance,
but she don't wanna dance slow

830
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,806
Beboppin' baby, girl,
you got me in a spin

831
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,770
Beboppin' baby, let the party begin

832
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,520
She's movin' so fast

833
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,688
You're gonna think that she's a twin

834
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,000
Hey, girl, slow down

835
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,440
I want to get to know ya

836
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,040
I know that I can show ya

837
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,840
You're the girl for me,
yeah, yeah, yeah

838
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,000
Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go

839
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,640
So let's not do "Bee-bopping Baby."

840
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,520
That's what the Georgia
guy's going to do.

841
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,400
You know what,
everybody's talking about him.

842
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,400
He's like really good.

843
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,000
Oh but he's not as good as you.

844
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,160
Now they'll probably go
in alphabetical order.

845
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,840
And that puts Ryan Wade last,
which is perfect!

846
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,240
I get the feeling,

847
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,200
you think that I can
actually win this thing.

848
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,324
I do, and you will.

849
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,600
Hey Ho!

850
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,960
Come on!

851
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,000
Whoo!

852
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,364
Hello, Nashville!

853
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,002
Whoo!

854
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:06,280
Are you ready to rock?

855
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,360
I said are you ready to rock?

856
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,440
Well, grab onto your britches,

857
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,920
boys and girls. Ha!

858
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:20,400
We're going to rock this place
like a hurricane. Come on!

859
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,251
Come on!

860
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,320
Hey. Hey, man.
Can I get a bourbon?

861
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,440
In a...

862
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,120
You know what, why don't you throw
me down a Shirley Temple instead.

863
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,620
- How much is ginger ale?
- 15 cents ma'am.

864
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,160
Thank you. We'll share one.

865
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,600
I'll have what he was going
to have, but make it a double.

866
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,440
A gypsy man, I'll always be

867
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,880
It is just a part of me

868
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,440
They say that I should settle down

869
00:57:54,540 --> 00:58:00,170
There's only once place...

870
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,571
Oh, yeah

871
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:10,880
I was born for a reason,
not just breathing air

872
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:16,200
Born for a reason,
got something to share

873
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,880
I'll make no bones about it,
sure as I'm sittin' here

874
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,560
I was born for a reason

875
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,520
Ooh!

876
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:38,440
That was... out of Mobile,
bringing everything

877
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,971
with the Drexel smash.

878
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,320
Slap the dog and spit in the fire,

879
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,160
that boy looks like our child.

880
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,845
Beboppin' baby,
you know she can go, go, go

881
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,885
Beboppin' baby, shake, a rock 'n roll

882
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,360
You can ask her to dance

883
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,960
But she don't want to dance slow

884
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:24,529
Beboppin' baby,
girl you got me in a spin

885
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,200
Beboppin' baby, let the party begin

886
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,920
Who are you?

887
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,120
The Volunteer state of
Tennessee put your hands

888
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:46,803
and screams together for Mr. Ryan Wade!

889
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,763
Ooh

890
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:16,881
I can see your picture in my mind

891
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:24,841
A vision that seems so very real

892
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:34,560
I miss you every night in my dreams

893
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:40,600
Time and space never keep us apart

894
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,480
Ahh

895
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,680
Your love's keeping me tonight

896
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,880
Ahh

897
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:57,080
Even when we're far away

898
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,600
Ahh

899
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:05,120
Your love's keeping me tonight

900
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,400
Ahh

901
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:13,160
Until the morning brings another day

902
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,045
Brings another day

903
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:23,760
Ooh, it's a brand new day

904
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:37,800
I can feel your touch like you are here

905
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:46,200
A perfect love will cast away my fears

906
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:54,360
I can hear your voice
blowin' in the wind

907
01:01:54,460 --> 01:02:01,250
Your love will turn
the darkness into light

908
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:09,523
Your love's keeping me tonight

909
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:17,568
Even when we're far away

910
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:25,171
Your love's keeping me tonight

911
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:34,090
Until the morning brings another day

912
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,003
Whoo!

913
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,525
That's your winner.

914
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,880
- I'm going to go talk to Mama okay?
- All right!

915
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,480
- All right. Have fun.
- I'll stay here.

916
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:26,411
Mama!

917
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,120
I've never seen so much
money in my whole life.

918
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,720
Much less at once.

919
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,600
Oh man, that was great.
Wasn't that great?

920
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,240
That was so great.
You did it.

921
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,568
You did great.

922
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,842
Mr. Wade.

923
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,840
Great show tonight, sir.

924
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,200
Thank you, sir.
"Mr. Tony Nash, Management."

925
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,080
I can have you play in
every major state fair

926
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,560
in the region next month
if you're interested.

927
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,560
Oh, he's interested!

928
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:55,160
Good. Look, Ryan, why don't you
come by my office Monday, okay?

929
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,800
- Thank you, sir. Monday?
- Monday.

930
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,360
All right, I'll see you there.

931
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,480
I've never seen anything
like that tonight.

932
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,680
It was absolutely incredible.

933
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,520
Be good.
Have a nice night.

934
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,200
Thank you.

935
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,920
What just happened?

936
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,280
I think he got a job.

937
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,360
Look, it's not rocket science.

938
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,120
I get you booked.

939
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,000
Get you paid.
You give me 15%.

940
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,640
You can fire me any time you like.

941
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:22,120
Has anyone ever? Fired you.

942
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:25,520
It's kind of an
occupational hazard, ma'am.

943
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,000
Yeah, well, I'm just trying to get my head

944
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,680
wrapped around people paying good money

945
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,160
to see someone act like somebody else.

946
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,760
Well, they do.
People love this guy.

947
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,360
They can't get enough of him.

948
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,720
And you're about as
close to the real thing

949
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,080
as I've ever seen.

950
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,880
So you can get me booked places?

951
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,440
Tennessee state fair is already
holding a spot for you.

952
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,720
Arkansas and Texas after that.

953
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:46,760
I haven't heard back yet from
Kansas City but it'll be a yes.

954
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,240
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

955
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:54,920
You will not believe your eyes
or your ears when I tell you

956
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,080
who this isn't,

957
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,400
but you are going to love him anyway.

958
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,640
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

959
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,001
for The identical!

960
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:15,080
Well, thank you very much, Nashville!

961
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,400
Right now we'd like to do a
song I think ya'll might know.

962
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,680
It goes like this.

963
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:34,360
It's a long way to Nashville

964
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:37,520
To the Vegas neon lights

965
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:41,040
I had to give my heart and soul

966
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,600
You know, it's been an uphill fight

967
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,560
Headed to dreamland...

968
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,360
Oh, come on people, don't be stupid.

969
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,880
We got a job to do here.

970
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,160
Hey, what's going on?

971
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,440
It's closing weekend.

972
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:56,000
Final judging of the livestock.

973
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,520
Wow.

974
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,840
Looks like either that
or Wayne Newton, right?

975
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,166
Heh.

976
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,720
Drexel!

977
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,448
Oh, man.
I think this boy's a star.

978
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:26,368
To Nashville tonight

979
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:30,400
To Nashville tonight

980
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:36,084
Ooh, to Nashville tonight

981
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:43,040
To Nashville tonight
To Nashville tonight

982
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:48,849
Ooh, Nashville tonight

983
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,760
A gypsy man, that's who I am

984
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:06,600
I do things my own way

985
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:10,000
I might be here for a little while

986
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,840
But I know that I won't stay

987
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:16,203
I'm a gypsy man

988
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:21,320
A gypsy man, I'll always be

989
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,000
It is just a part of me

990
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,800
They say that I should settle down

991
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:35,720
But there are so many places,
so many towns, yeah

992
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,002
Ooh

993
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:44,000
Something 'bout ya that I feel

994
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:47,400
It makes me want to stay

995
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:51,360
Girl, when you put your love on me

996
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:56,760
I just got to stay, I'm a gypsy man

997
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,080
Yes, I am

998
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:02,640
A gypsy man, I'll always be

999
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:06,400
It is just a part of me

1000
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:10,040
They say that I should settle down

1001
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:16,320
But there are so many places,
so many towns

1002
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,240
Oh, I got a lot of places to see

1003
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,560
Yeah!

1004
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,171
Ooh

1005
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,520
I want you to be proud of me, Daddy.

1006
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:37,440
I am proud of you, Ryan.

1007
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,720
I am proud of you.

1008
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:44,481
Was this what you really wanted, really?

1009
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:51,881
I don't know.

1010
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:01,440
Ryan took his act as far as it could go.

1011
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,600
Doing 200 dates a year
was beginning to feel

1012
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,960
like a man running on a hamster wheel.

1013
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,400
But still, it wasn't
without its rewards.

1014
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:17,000
I feel I know you

1015
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:22,760
I wish that I could show you

1016
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,520
There's something that I'm feeling

1017
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:43,640
That it's real, I feel like I know you

1018
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:48,680
I wish that I could show you

1019
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,920
Wow.

1020
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,680
That was great.
That was great.

1021
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:55,240
Thanks.

1022
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,680
Well...

1023
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,360
You know you missed three cues tonight.

1024
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,440
You'll leave one off
the set list entirely,

1025
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,880
but we've got time to
rehearse other songs.

1026
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,520
So what was that anyway?

1027
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,480
It's one of mine.
It's an original.

1028
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:08,640
Oh, an original.
Cool!

1029
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,240
I want to work it into one of our sets.

1030
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,160
Forget it.

1031
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:13,400
Forget that?

1032
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,240
That's right, forget it.

1033
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:18,200
These people are paying
to hear Drexel "The Dream,"

1034
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,731
not Ryan the Dream.

1035
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,120
Oh, I see, creative discretion.

1036
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,280
No, it's we're booked two years out

1037
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,600
doing Drexel and Drexel only.

1038
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,480
I mean, you're printing money.

1039
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,440
You're making enough money to support

1040
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,920
five of Dino's ex-wives on top
of the two he's already got.

1041
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:38,760
And all of you, you just
want to walk off a cliff

1042
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,520
and kill this golden goose.

1043
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,080
You know, it ain't always
about the money, Tony.

1044
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,120
Grow up, Ryan.
You know what,

1045
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:47,400
this is what you guys have been doing
instead of rehearsing the show?

1046
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,640
You know what, it shows.

1047
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,440
What are you talking about?

1048
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:52,560
I'm talking about you all
getting fat and lazy,

1049
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,520
that's what I'm talking about.
You're not hungry anymore.

1050
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:58,280
Look, Tony, I'm sick and tired
of doing the same songs

1051
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,800
the same way 200 shows a year.

1052
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,680
Being somebody I'm not.

1053
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,800
Well, unfortunately that's
what you signed on for,

1054
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:05,800
and that's what you are.

1055
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,640
What is the big deal?

1056
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,520
I just want to work some of my songs in.

1057
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:13,600
Nobody wants to hear your songs, Ryan!

1058
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,160
You don't know that.

1059
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,171
All right.

1060
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:23,520
Shall I spell it out for you, Ryan?

1061
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,640
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1062
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,880
I didn't sign Ryan Wade the artist.

1063
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:33,880
I signed Ryan Wade
"The identical."

1064
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:38,051
The best Drexel impersonator
I'd ever heard or seen.

1065
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:46,000
And I've worked too hard
to let you destroy it.

1066
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,720
You want to work on your own
songs on your own time,

1067
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,360
that's your business.

1068
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,280
This right here,

1069
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,520
this is my business, son.

1070
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,520
You can't talk to me like that.

1071
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:57,920
You were a rich turner singing in

1072
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,920
the church choir when I found you.

1073
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,160
Back off, Tony.

1074
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,400
Hey, I made you, Ryan Wade,

1075
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,800
and don't you ever forget it.

1076
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:07,891
You didn't make anything.

1077
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,280
It's over, Tony.

1078
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,880
I quit.

1079
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,720
You quit?

1080
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,200
Well, go on and quit.

1081
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,400
Ryan, there's only one Elvis.

1082
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,600
There's one Drexel and
there's one Beatles,

1083
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,400
and you're a pretender, buddy.
You're a nothing!

1084
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,285
Nobody's ever going to sign you.

1085
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,720
I'm home.

1086
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,365
Hi.

1087
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,560
It was like starting all over again

1088
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:54,000
and falling in love for the first time.

1089
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,840
For just a little while,

1090
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:00,040
we were both living our dream, together.

1091
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,920
City lights keep on shining

1092
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:08,200
Reminds me of the love we knew

1093
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,840
City lights keep on shining

1094
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:15,920
I see your smilin' eyes a'blue

1095
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:20,120
City lights keep on shining

1096
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:23,880
Reminds me of a love we knew

1097
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:27,760
City lights keep on shining

1098
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:30,645
I see your smilin' eyes a'blue

1099
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:36,240
Country boy, city girl

1100
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:39,120
We were like night and day

1101
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:42,920
I took her to the country

1102
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,203
But she just wouldn't stay

1103
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:52,240
Yes, sir.

1104
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,600
Yeah, absolutely, I'll be there.

1105
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,167
Thank you, sir. Bye.

1106
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:04,563
City of Peace Records wants
to meet with me tomorrow.

1107
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,965
Whoo!

1108
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:12,920
We believe City Lights is a smash hit.

1109
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,200
Now, Ryan,

1110
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:23,006
I want you to hear me, brother.

1111
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:29,000
I'm prepared to give you $25,000
right now for your song.

1112
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,280
Take it in the studio

1113
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:35,600
and cut it on The Dream himself.

1114
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,280
Drexel Hemsley.

1115
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,767
Now how does that sound to you.

1116
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:47,040
It's a mighty generous offer,

1117
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,527
but I just want to record my own music.

1118
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,050
It's not about the money.

1119
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,490
It never was.

1120
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,167
Okay, $50,000!

1121
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:15,080
Some dreams maybe
just aren't meant to be.

1122
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:19,280
But dreams take a backseat
to just plain health.

1123
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:22,280
It all came to a head
one September morning.

1124
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:26,530
Actually, everything came
to a head that day.

1125
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:42,681
I'm here, Dexter. I'm here.

1126
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:48,650
Why you and not me?

1127
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,560
I don't get it, man.

1128
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:06,840
Listen, I don't care what they say,

1129
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:10,080
you're still the greatest
singer I ever heard.

1130
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,406
Ever.

1131
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,046
Ryan!

1132
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,800
Ryan!

1133
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,520
Two months after Drexel
Hemsley's untimely death,

1134
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,520
the investigation of the cause
of the fatal crash continues.

1135
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,600
Thousands still gather outside the gates

1136
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,080
of his former home, Dreamland.

1137
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:40,840
Letters and cards overrun
the Nashville residence

1138
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:43,247
on a daily basis.

1139
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:52,560
You rain down from heaven above

1140
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:08,971
Now I'm clear to see
what's happened to me

1141
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:13,480
Amen.

1142
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:14,920
Oh, it's so good to have you kids here.

1143
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:18,000
That is the sweetest dress on you.

1144
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,200
Why, thank you.

1145
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,880
And, honey, you look better.

1146
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,440
Thank you, Mama.

1147
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,480
Are you back work yet?

1148
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,360
Not yet, Mama.
Not yet.

1149
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,040
Brother Wade, what's new at church?

1150
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:35,120
Not much, really.

1151
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:39,211
Except the board asked
me to resign on Monday.

1152
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,280
Forty years.

1153
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:50,680
Forty years.
Practically built that place

1154
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:51,840
with my own two hands.

1155
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:55,360
He used to go in his short
pants and start the coal fire

1156
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,080
at five o'clock in the
morning before worship.

1157
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,200
That's right.

1158
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,280
Now I can't even change the light bulb

1159
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,280
without getting dizzy.

1160
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,640
Heh. Jenny, last month

1161
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:10,000
I preached the best sermon
of my whole career.

1162
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,040
Oh, it was outstanding.

1163
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:14,600
And Ed Nichols reminds me,

1164
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:17,720
I preached the same one a year ago.

1165
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,480
And I said, "Brother Nichols,
what's wrong with that?

1166
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,000
You just got blessed twice."

1167
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:27,047
Oh yeah. It's time.

1168
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:29,880
You ready for him to
be home all the time?

1169
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:33,000
Oh, I been waiting many a year.

1170
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,480
But I finished the race.

1171
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:39,520
Wasn't always pretty,
sometimes it wasn't much fun.

1172
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:41,440
But I got there.

1173
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:44,800
There isn't a better feeling
this side of heaven.

1174
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:48,527
Congratulations, Daddy.
Really.

1175
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:54,400
I want you to have that
same feeling, son.

1176
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,120
It's not too late.

1177
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:58,440
Oh, Daddy!
This isn't the time.

1178
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:01,680
Let's just have a calm
family supper without any...

1179
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:04,200
No, now is the time!

1180
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:08,000
He may be all grown up,
but we're his parents.

1181
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:12,720
What are you going to do, Ryan?

1182
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:15,000
You going to sit inside the house

1183
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,840
and mourn for the rest of your life?

1184
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,480
You know what, y'all?

1185
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:21,960
You will honor your father by listening.

1186
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,240
Whether you want to hear this or not.

1187
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:27,320
I have heard it, Daddy.
A hundred times.

1188
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,120
Why?

1189
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:32,160
Why do you keep running from this, son?

1190
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:35,200
God set you apart, son.

1191
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,482
No, He didn't!

1192
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,840
Oh, I know the story, Daddy.

1193
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,800
I know it real well.

1194
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:47,720
You dedicated me to God.

1195
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,880
I know you have a vision for my life.

1196
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:54,600
Well, you know what?
It's not my vision, Daddy.

1197
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:57,120
The call you heard was for
your life, not mine, not for me.

1198
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:00,720
I'm trying to help you, son.

1199
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:02,280
Please, will you, contain yourself!

1200
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,720
I'm trying to help the boy.

1201
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:06,440
Daddy, what's wrong?

1202
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:09,080
Daddy? What is it, honey?

1203
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,480
Oh dear!

1204
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,400
Oh, Jenny!

1205
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,040
- Okay, I'm coming.
- Daddy, what's wrong?

1206
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,600
I think he's having a heart attack.

1207
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,160
Mom, you call an ambulance.
Call an ambulance, Mom.

1208
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,520
My pills!

1209
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:19,920
I'll get them, Daddy, I'll get them.

1210
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:21,240
- It's all right.
- Get my pills.

1211
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,680
It's all right.

1212
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:35,440
We're gettin' you help, honey.

1213
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,040
We'll ride with y'all.

1214
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:38,680
We're right here, honey.
We're right here.

1215
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,200
I'll follow, Mama.
I'm right behind you.

1216
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,560
In the name of God
Almighty and Jesus Christ,

1217
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,046
I command the Holy Spirit...

1218
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:49,890
I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm sorry.

1219
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,560
Our dear son.

1220
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,840
If you are reading these words

1221
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:03,567
it means your mother and I
have passed from this life.

1222
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:10,680
Time has come for you
to know who you are

1223
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:13,326
and where you come from.

1224
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,920
You were born to a mama
and daddy who love you

1225
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:22,488
but can't give you the life we want.

1226
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,880
We believe God has put you
here for something special

1227
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:32,210
and we asked a man of God
to raise you up proper like.

1228
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,360
You have an identical twin brother

1229
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:40,450
who is reading a letter
just like yours right now.

1230
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:48,440
So forgive us and understand

1231
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,960
this is what we had to do.

1232
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:54,050
We love you and will see you in heaven.

1233
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,680
Your daddy, your momma,

1234
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:01,407
William and Helen Hemsley.

1235
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:22,720
Hello?

1236
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:24,600
It was a mild heart attack.

1237
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,200
He's going to be okay.

1238
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,960
Think of coming down?

1239
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:31,040
No. Not right now.

1240
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,971
Ryan, your father wants to see you.

1241
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,080
Honey?

1242
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,000
Tell him I'm glad he's all right.

1243
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,640
Tell Mama...

1244
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:46,880
tell her I know now, and I understand.

1245
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,640
Understand what?

1246
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:50,444
She'll know.

1247
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,529
Now, what can I get for you?

1248
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,480
I...

1249
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,603
How about a whiskey?

1250
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:12,450
That will cure your ills, my friend.

1251
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:20,360
Ryan? Ryan Wade?

1252
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:23,131
Down here.

1253
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,320
I can't believe this.

1254
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:29,360
Darling, darling,
do you know who this is?

1255
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,120
No, baby.

1256
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:32,640
I told you I knew people.

1257
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,160
Maybe now you'll be nicer to me.

1258
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:37,280
This is none other than The identical.

1259
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,440
What are you doing here?

1260
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,640
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

1261
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:42,880
Name's Damon.

1262
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:47,200
I saw you once in Atlanta.

1263
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,760
Man, I about died. I thought
you was The Dream himself.

1264
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:52,640
How did you get so dang good anyway?

1265
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:55,640
Born to it I guess.

1266
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,720
Miss, if you don't mind

1267
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,880
I'm going to trade this
in for something else.

1268
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:03,160
- A Dr. Pepper or something.
- Oh, yeah.

1269
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,249
Put it on my tab, darling.

1270
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:12,440
Gave it up, huh?

1271
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,920
Man, that's a shame.

1272
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:18,240
How did you get into this?

1273
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,800
I was pouring drinks at his hotel once.

1274
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,920
He stopped and talked to me.

1275
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:25,560
Treated me like a real human being.

1276
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:27,240
Like he cared what I had to say.

1277
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:30,284
First average size person ever did that.

1278
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:33,849
Changed my life.

1279
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,720
I see you've still got your chai though,

1280
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,120
just like his.

1281
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:44,080
Yeah, why did he wear one?

1282
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,960
- He was Jewish.
- What?

1283
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:48,360
On his mother's side.
Look it up.

1284
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:49,720
Really?

1285
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:53,560
A Christian and a Jew.
Same guy. Heh.

1286
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:56,320
He used to say he was
covering his bases.

1287
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,760
You believe that?
Isn't that great?

1288
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:00,246
Yeah.

1289
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,688
You're looking for
something, aren't you?

1290
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:09,840
Maybe.

1291
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:14,280
Let me give you a
little hint, Ryan Wade.

1292
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:19,080
It ain't here, but keep looking.

1293
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:23,080
You'll find it eventually.
Well, I'm up next.

1294
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:27,205
Stick around. You might
learn something, identical.

1295
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,002
Got to go.

1296
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:41,720
I got a great, big love for you

1297
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:45,120
I never been small,
I've always been tall

1298
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:47,760
I got a great, big love for you

1299
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:50,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

1300
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,360
Come on now!

1301
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,409
Give it to me

1302
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:11,243
Oh, the hands are tied

1303
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:20,963
Oh, I cannot see what's
right in front of me

1304
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:28,280
Where in the world will I
be with my next step I take

1305
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:31,280
Time, it keeps playing its tricks on me

1306
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:35,560
As I move along, feel me get closer

1307
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:39,560
'Cause I know this there's
something about ya

1308
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:44,080
I can take a trip to see
all there is to see

1309
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:47,840
I can be in jail then set free

1310
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:52,240
Getting trashed by a queen,
laid out at her feet

1311
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:56,604
But in the end,
there's something about ya

1312
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,360
I'm sorry, baby.

1313
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:56,320
I just thought it was some
kind of answer to prayer.

1314
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:57,560
We'll figure something out.

1315
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,171
Okay?

1316
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:07,402
Willie, I'll pray too.

1317
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:14,080
William Hemsley's health
deteriorated after Helen died.

1318
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:16,880
Now with the passing of Drexel

1319
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:21,688
he was a frail and broken
man well beyond his years.

1320
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,290
I'm sorry, sir.
We're closing.

1321
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:38,200
He had a brother.

1322
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:40,289
Dexter Ryan?

1323
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:43,600
He only made it one day.

1324
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:45,640
Where is he buried?

1325
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:48,000
Out back, up the hill.

1326
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,202
Thank you, ma'am.

1327
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:57,240
Ryan knew the car instantly

1328
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:00,400
that was parked by the
private Hemsley cemetery

1329
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,800
and there's only one person

1330
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:04,400
that would possibly take that limo

1331
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,807
to visit those graves on this day.

1332
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,568
I'm sorry for your loss.

1333
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:17,600
Nobody really know'd him.

1334
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:22,560
All the papers talk about
his mistakes, his weaknesses.

1335
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:25,600
Hell, like we ain't all got them.

1336
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:29,930
Most people don't know this.

1337
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:34,400
He was born with an identical twin.

1338
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:45,288
It was...

1339
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:49,884
it was a hard day.

1340
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:54,690
It was a hard day.

1341
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,484
My boy.

1342
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:06,441
My perfect boy.

1343
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,930
My sweet boy.

1344
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:15,530
Forgive me.

1345
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:20,480
You're already forgiven.
You know that.

1346
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:24,960
No. No, I ain't forgiven.
I ain't forgiven.

1347
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:27,401
I ain't forgiven.

1348
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:31,808
Mr. Hemsley...

1349
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:36,765
I know it was a hard day.

1350
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:42,400
See...

1351
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,840
I was there.

1352
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:51,200
It's me, Daddy.

1353
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:57,362
Dexter Ryan Hemsley.

1354
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:00,289
My son.

1355
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,970
My son.

1356
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,969
My son.

1357
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:45,160
Angel of my life

1358
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:49,960
You're all I need

1359
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:53,920
You came into my life

1360
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:57,680
When I was alone

1361
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:03,680
Made me believe, I was alone

1362
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:05,928
Made me believe

1363
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:30,880
You, working on the car?

1364
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:33,003
Oh, praise Jesus.

1365
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:37,080
It's supposed to be good for me.

1366
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:41,880
It's supposed to keep my...
to keep my mind active,

1367
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:46,960
but... I think it's just a
complete waste of time.

1368
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:48,760
I mean, you know me with this...

1369
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:50,320
I'll do it, Daddy.

1370
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:53,560
I always told you I'd
wrestle you to the ground

1371
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:56,240
before I let you ride
one of them things.

1372
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:00,767
You're too big for that now.

1373
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:06,680
I wanted to tell you

1374
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:12,280
so many times, Ryan... I...

1375
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,840
I know, Daddy.

1376
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:16,200
I just...

1377
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:17,242
I know.

1378
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,800
There's something I've got to tell you.

1379
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,128
Okay.

1380
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:29,284
Thank you.

1381
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:36,120
And I mean thank you...

1382
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:39,244
for everything.

1383
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,602
And I mean everything, Daddy.

1384
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:46,888
Ryan.

1385
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:49,524
Oh...

1386
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:55,722
You are my son.

1387
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:01,080
And you are more

1388
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:04,762
than I ever dared pray for.

1389
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:10,360
I want you to follow your dream,

1390
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:12,927
your calling, not mine.

1391
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,841
Because you blessed me boy.

1392
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,640
You blessed me, Ryan.

1393
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:28,448
And I'm sorry, son.
I'm sorry, son.

1394
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:35,240
Ryan never let on to
anyone but his family

1395
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:38,920
who he really was and
came to walk the path

1396
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:42,080
of singing both his and
his brother's songs.

1397
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:53,960
City lights keep on shining

1398
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:58,040
Reminds me of the love we knew

1399
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:01,840
City lights keep on shining

1400
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:06,360
I see your smilin' eyes a'blue

1401
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:10,080
City lights keep on shining

1402
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:14,680
Reminds me of the love we knew

1403
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:18,480
City lights keep on shining

1404
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:21,680
I see your smilin' eyes a'blue

1405
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:25,720
Country boy, city girl

1406
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:29,560
We were like night and day

1407
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:33,600
I took her to the country

1408
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:37,440
But she just wouldn't stay

1409
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:41,320
City lights keep on shining

1410
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:45,760
She was a dancer on the stage of life

1411
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:49,120
City lights keep on shining

1412
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:52,720
All I wanted was a wife

1413
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:57,040
Shining, shining

1414
01:37:57,140 --> 01:38:01,120
Shining on you and me

1415
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:04,800
Shining, shining

1416
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:08,243
Shining like it used to be

1417
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:11,000
I guess it's true.

1418
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:15,967
If He is in our dreams,
no one can stand against them.
