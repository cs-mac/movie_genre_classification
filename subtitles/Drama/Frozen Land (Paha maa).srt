Solar Films presents

2
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,686
A Markus Selin Production

3
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,686
An Aku Louhimies Film

4
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,727
<i>Born pure into the future's hands
in these cold and northern lands</i>

5
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,720
<i>Eppu Normaali
"A Land of Mournful Songs“</i>

6
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,802
<i>I never wanted this to happen.</i>

7
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,961
<i>Do you remember the questions
we asked each other as kids?</i>

8
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,441
<i>How big is space?</i>

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,323
<i>Where does the sky end?
Where does the sea begin?</i>

10
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,168
<i>Why can't I scream
when I feel bad?</i>

11
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,927
<i>What's the point of living
if this life is merely he"?</i>

12
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,321
<i>But we have to believe
that in the end</i> -

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,244
<i>things work out for the best.</i>

14
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,490
<i>Otherwise, nothing
makes any sense.</i>

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,722
FROZEN LAND

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,406
Commencement, conflict,
transformation, and so on.

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,561
What's relevant is what is
said, not how it's said.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,244
Tell me about Tolstoy's world.

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,489
He discusses one -

20
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,447
where people peddle
their own private hells.

21
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,008
Person A shoves it onto B -

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,445
who cannot help but pass
it onto C. And so on

23
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,481
Essays back next week please.

24
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,043
And don't download
them from the net.

25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,446
This is our new EDP teacher.
- Antti Arhama, physics and EDP.

26
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,523
Pertti Smolander. Literature
studies I' though not very literate.

27
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,202
I'll be back shortly. Pertti,
can I see you for a moment?

28
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,130
You're talked of
as our most popular, -

29
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,041
possibly our best teacher.

30
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,687
I wouldn't know about that.

31
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,643
But we have
a problem which means -

32
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,810
we are going
to have to let you go.

33
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,167
Our main focus
on EDP and math -

34
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,082
means we don't need
so many Lit. teachers.

35
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,606
It's beyond my control I'm
afraid. I'm really sorry.

36
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,806
UNEMPLOYMENT

37
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,321
Hell. Cold

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,324
Was there this much snow last
winter when I got the boot.

39
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,846
Where are we going?

40
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,369
Niko! Niko!

41
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,003
Turn it down.

42
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,727
You're like Oblomov.
You only bloody lie there.

43
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,486
Pull yourself together.

44
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,482
I promised to
lend this to these guys.

45
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,001
Just temporarily.

46
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,008
The CD player?
I gotta disk in it.

47
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,170
It'll stay there.

48
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,882
Keep it. Have fun!
We didn't like it anyway!

49
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,204
Get out of here. Go on.
You know where the door is.

50
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,641
I saved a long
time for that player.

51
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,810
Leave me alone.
Just like your mom did.

52
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,487
Take the whole shelf.

53
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,764
Give that to me.

54
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,084
Are you trying to teach ME?

55
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,047
Are you raising ME,
you punk?

56
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,929
Move on out!

57
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,726
Niko, please.

58
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,608
Lend me a twenty.

59
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,768
If I had it, I would.
I don't have any.

60
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,407
"I don't have any"-

61
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,288
Where did you get it before?
- None of your business

62
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,850
Beat it!
And don't come back!

63
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,327
Not without a job!

64
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,245
Were you sleeping? - No

65
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,647
Oh, yes you were.
Sleeping this late.

66
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,128
Hi. Happy New Year.

67
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,690
What am I doing with these?

68
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,689
Is this a bad time to call?

69
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,169
How come you're
not opening the door?

70
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,602
What's the plan for
tonight? Fireworks?

71
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,368
My cousin's throwing
a party. - I'll join you.

72
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,449
We can do the fireworks.

73
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,691
Can I take a nap here? I'm
fucked. - Be my guest.

74
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,524
I have to take
my parents to the airport.

75
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,009
We're off. - My old
man threw me out.

76
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,369
What? - Nothing.
See you tonight.

77
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,330
Chill out. Lock the door.

78
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,801
What's this place we're
going? - It's my cousin's.

79
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,811
What's in there? - What are you
up to? Where are you going?

80
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,130
Let's take him with us.
- Are you coming with us?

81
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,643
Heavy duty.

82
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,171
Going downhill is much
less hassle than going up.

83
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,847
Mankind is
coming to the end...

84
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,767
Yeah. The end is near.

85
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,131
I mean really close.

86
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,085
Can you
upgrade my computer?

87
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,086
Six, five, four, -

88
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,410
three, two, one!

89
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,720
Ten, nine, eight

90
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,044
What's up? Pass it this way.

91
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,805
Pass it on to Tuomas.
- He won't have any.

92
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,682
What's that?

93
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,402
Print it out! - No way.

94
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,843
Go on. Let's take a look..

95
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,525
Can I have a line?
Just one.

96
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,761
I'll have your line, too.

97
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,443
Coming, coming!

98
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,970
Tuomas. Why not give it a try?
- Don't touch anything!

99
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,810
Come back to the party!
- You know you can trust me.

100
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,688
Niko, come over here!
- No sweat. I'm not stupid.

101
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,084
How much for the player?
- Let's say about forty.

102
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,201
Come on. Twenty is more
like it. - Don't make me laugh.

103
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,970
Twenty-five. - Thirty.

104
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,530
Let's make it twenty-five.
- Thirty's as low as I go.

105
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,490
OK. Thirty it is.

106
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Don't you have anything
smaller? - Not right now

107
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,529
But hey! That's money,
too. Money! Money!

108
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,690
Two, three, four...

109
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,207
There you go! - Were
you trying to screw me?

110
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,204
Happy New Year!
- Same to you.

111
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,925
You fucking stupid bitch!
Are you blind?

112
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,521
You'd let them pay
you in toilet paper!

113
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,246
How can you tell? It looks
real! - No hologram!

114
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,923
What-gram? - Holo! Hologram!
They all have one these days!

115
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,565
How should I know?

116
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,967
These euros all look
like funny money to me.

117
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,562
All you do round here is
read the tabloids and booze.

118
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,131
Good morning.

119
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,608
Do you have any old
coins? - Old coins...

120
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,602
Fucking old coins!

121
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,248
BOOZE

122
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,044
It's been looked after.
Barely used.

123
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,964
Just need a bit of cash.

124
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,609
It was an engagement
present, just six months old.

125
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,406
Wide-screen, 28".

126
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,882
Five hundred.

127
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,521
A thousand.

128
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,367
It's as good as new, y'know.

129
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,967
Still six payments to go.

130
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,329
Five-ten. - OK.
If that's your final offer

131
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,490
These don't keep their value.

132
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,728
Always a newer model.

133
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,130
There's a big note in there.

134
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,403
Money is money.

135
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,242
What shampoo do you
use? - Why is that?

136
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,370
Your hair's a bit limp.

137
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,121
It happens I have some state
of the art shampoo in the car.

138
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,721
I don't need it.
- You could stock it here.

139
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,322
We don't sell shampoo.
- Hell of a profit margin.

140
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,081
Buy cheap, sell dear.
Fat profits. - No deal.

141
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,204
You've got a new routine.
- Yeah.

142
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,842
Why are you
still hanging about?

143
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,604
Just thought I'd return the
keys. - I'll pass them on.

144
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,209
How about dinner tonight?

145
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,164
Somewhere rich.
Your choice. - Why?

146
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,165
Why not?

147
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,806
Where's the money from?

148
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,443
I have a new job.

149
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,488
Good for you.

150
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,843
What restaurant you working
in? - Not in a restaurant.

151
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,044
A household appliance store.

152
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,482
TVs and stuff.

153
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,366
Hey, wait. How about
a drink? - It's no use.

154
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,364
Or maybe a drive?

155
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,324
Isto, you're
a really nice guy.

156
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,966
But it just doesn't
work for me any more.

157
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,370
Please. I love you.
A couple of drinks...

158
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,765
Can I buy you dolls some
hot shots? - No thanks.

159
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,726
Isto pays for everything.
Let's go to a hotel.

160
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,401
You're gorgeous,
you know that?

161
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,170
Fuck off!

162
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,967
Don't mess with me, asshole!
Do I look like I'm broke?

163
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,408
This guy's not with us.

164
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,203
What do you think this is?

165
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,123
What's this? What's this?

166
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,768
It's money!

167
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,642
I'm not a forger.

168
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,887
I sold my TV.

169
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,847
I have a Ford Mercury.
American.

170
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,369
A great fucking car.

171
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,211
Let me outta here!

172
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,485
Morning, Virtanen. Another
day, another hearing.

173
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,886
You haven't been messing
with drugs, have you?

174
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,166
Don't feel like talking?

175
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,648
Can I go home?
- That's not up to us.

176
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,968
Drop your pants
and spread your legs.

177
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,442
Just relax.

178
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,806
OK. Put your clothes on.

179
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,964
The only sure thing is death!

180
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,721
Fuck!

181
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,045
Fuck!

182
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,289
Jerk! Jerk! Faggot!

183
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,205
Straight through
- and no alarm.

184
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,528
Smart ass security
systems - complete waste.

185
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,246
When are the police coming?
- In the afternoon.

186
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,162
Matikainen! Someone to
see you! - Fucking hell!

187
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,324
Sit down.

188
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,202
What do you want?

189
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,969
Looks like
business is good.

190
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,251
Is that what
you're here to tell me?

191
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,163
I would like to -

192
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,721
to make a new deal, -

193
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,608
if that's OK.

194
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,604
I'll cover the interest
with a vacuum cleaner.

195
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,321
That's for you.

196
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,526
Plus a year's supply
of hair shampoo.

197
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,650
It's good shampoo.
Dandruff...

198
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,403
Do you take me
for an utter moron?

199
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,763
I'm temporarily short of cash.
- When do you have it?

200
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,888
When the snow melts...

201
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,684
When? - Let's say in May.

202
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,765
By Mother's Day.
- Mother's Day?

203
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,804
Where's this money coming from?
Selling vacuum cleaners?

204
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,288
I've told you that selling
Hoovers is bullshit.

205
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,444
How many have you sold?

206
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,361
How many? Tell me.

207
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,088
How many exactly?

208
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,444
Quite a few.
And a lot of hair shampoo.

209
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,683
Where is the money?

210
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,927
If you don't pay up, you lose
your car. Fucking simple.

211
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,287
Can you cut me some slack.
For old times' sake.

212
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,610
<i>Jartsa...</i>

213
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,284
Goodbye.

214
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,691
Hi there.

215
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,724
Allow me to demonstrate
this vacuum cleaner.

216
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,767
What brand do you use?
- An ordinary one.

217
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,527
Have you ever
seen one of these?

218
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,809
Do you speak Finnish?
- No, no.

219
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,210
What sort of
shampoo do the kids...

220
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,846
What shampoo do you
use? - Me or the dog?

221
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,846
Latest model.
- A bit expensive.

222
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,283
There's a payment plan...
- No, no...

223
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,526
Metal casing.
- Not interested.

224
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,042
A black dress
shows all the dust...

225
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,007
Made in Sweden.
The land of honest labor.

226
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,167
We don't buy anything.

227
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,649
My bathroom's
full of shampoo...

228
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,443
How old is the dog?

229
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,330
Didn't you see the sign?
- I am not vending...

230
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,005
I'm a sales representative...
- Really? Bye!

231
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,843
When you're
dealing with alcohol, -

232
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,089
you're dealing with
a cunning adversary.

233
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,568
By ourselves, we're
not strong enough.

234
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,560
We need
God's assistance.

235
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,848
We'll take it in turn
starting with Teuvo.

236
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,170
My name is Teuvo.
I'm an alcoholic.

237
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,450
Where should I start today?

238
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,443
Today wasn't exactly
a major success.

239
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,330
My mind is blurry.

240
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,606
I haven't been close -

241
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,688
to anyone -

242
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,771
for a long time.

243
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,167
For reasons of my own.

244
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,689
I guess my car has
been my best buddy.

245
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,242
Sounds funny.
But now I've lost it.

246
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,800
But spring is on its way.

247
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,324
A time of hope.

248
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:58,242
And I thank God
for a sober day today.

249
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,924
Thank you... Mauri.

250
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,931
I'm Mauri.
And I'm an alcoholic.

251
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,882
It's tough making
it here but I'm happy -

252
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,281
to know I'm not alone.

253
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,490
Would you like
vacuuming to be easier?

254
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,569
It's time to make
your life easier.

255
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,365
Open the door!
Bastard! You wanna die?

256
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,050
This is for the five hundred.

257
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,765
With some interest!

258
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,531
THE AXE

259
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,246
Fuck!
The light's red, you jerk!

260
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,681
You looking for
a knuckle sandwich?

261
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,130
Homo! Faggot!

262
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,086
Hi. Any vacancies?

263
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,729
Just for the night.

264
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,002
Alcohol goes into circulation
when it hits your lips.

265
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,848
That first slug
of an ice-cold beer.

266
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,283
It just hits your fucking brain!
And let's talk about the profit!

267
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,563
What's the purchase price?
Maybe 80 cents?

268
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,082
The keg costs you 50 euros.

269
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,644
But after that -

270
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,802
when you've once payed
for the keg, it's kinda free.

271
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,323
You following me?

272
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,444
Some places have the nerve -

273
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,891
to ask for eight euros a pint.

274
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,324
Or seven... six. Of course,
it's more often five.

275
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,603
But starting from nine.

276
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,808
A coffee, please.

277
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,290
And another one.

278
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,048
Another coffee, please.

279
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,522
Was it good? - Sorry?

280
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,490
How did it taste?
The coffee?

281
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,328
Fine.

282
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,646
You look familiar.

283
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,367
Where you from?
- Hollola.

284
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,009
How about you?

285
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,965
I live in Nummela these days.

286
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,846
I have a major
car dealership there.

287
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,051
Cars?
- Yes, big, fancy cars.

288
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,884
How about
the financing options?

289
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,325
Depends on the down
payment. Isto. Virtanen.

290
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,331
Hurskainen.
Teuvo. Teukka.

291
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,449
"What shampoo do you use?"

292
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,170
We're selling the same brand.

293
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,088
Like they say in the US,
the world's one big network.

294
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,888
Any good bonuses lately?
- Quite a bit.

295
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,971
I have a vacuum cleaner
business on the side.

296
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,128
I owe money
to the shampoo supplier.

297
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,082
Are you going
to stick to coffee all night?

298
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,410
Let me get you a round.

299
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,842
We'll put the drinks
on my room bill.

300
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,489
A glass of milk.
- A glass of milk!

301
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,370
You're drinking milk!

302
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,921
Milk.

303
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,522
A man who drinks milk.

304
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,363
A double whiskey!

305
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,762
A double whiskey.
Now we're talking.

306
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,491
Milk, followed
by a double whiskey.

307
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,245
Way to go!
Milk lines your stomach.

308
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,088
"Our company is doing a-okay..."

309
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,284
With all the accessories.

310
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,322
"Our company is doing a-okay..."

311
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,410
Isn't she a beauty?

312
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,809
One click and everything opens.

313
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,361
Let's party!

314
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,040
We'll round up some girls.

315
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,285
I release my aggressions.

316
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,603
Fuck! I'm going
the beat the car up!

317
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,008
Tonight we're going for a spin.

318
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,361
Go on, check out that box!

319
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,246
It's a fucking TV!

320
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,011
Sky channels and all.

321
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,967
14 channels and MTV!
- I'd like to have a go.

322
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,641
No jerk is driving my
car drunk! No one!

323
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,923
No drunk is driving my car.

324
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,041
Look, Teukka

325
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,001
Hey! Let's wank!

326
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,049
All emissions
go through 8 filters.

327
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,851
Hose attachment
is in the rear.

328
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,130
One click and
everything opens.

329
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,528
Fire at will! Take cover!

330
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,203
You're so beautiful.
Can I kiss you?

331
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,444
No, don't! Stop it.

332
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,045
If I'm not interested
then I don't want it.

333
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,248
Help! - Hey, Teukka.

334
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,847
He's trying to rape me.

335
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,011
That's no way to treat a
woman. Gently does it.

336
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,605
You gotta to
be gentle with them.

337
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,528
Like this.

338
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,485
A few kisses.

339
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,770
Look. This is the way.

340
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,451
Gently, Teukka. Look.

341
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,007
Smile. Smile.

342
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,247
This is the way.

343
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,449
Smile.

344
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,409
Get the fuck out of here. Go
screw your vacuum cleaner.

345
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,081
Help! Help!

346
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,887
Don't kill me! Don't!

347
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,081
A guy with a mustache and
a mullet. A pilot's flight jacket.

348
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,008
Is he still here? - Yes.

349
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,170
Will this be on the
same bill? - Yes.

350
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,769
Anything from the
mini bar? - No.

351
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,247
I'd like to see his records.
- Just a moment.

352
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,170
237.

353
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,407
FAMILY

354
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,766
How about
another two weeks?

355
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,042
Have you
been depressed lately?

356
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,764
What if I just go home.
I don't want any more leave.

357
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,887
How've you been handling
your job lately? Overall?

358
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,241
What do your partners think?

359
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,602
Everything's fine.

360
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,246
You're sleeping okay?

361
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,563
You're not taking
unnecessary risks?

362
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,886
For depression:
1 tablet as required.

363
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,964
Hi. - Hi.

364
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,003
Don't you have your key?

365
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,441
I left it at home.

366
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,923
Any homework? - None
today. I did it all at school.

367
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,804
We were
learning about colors.

368
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,681
There's a new color.
Oh, come on.

369
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,289
Cut it out!

370
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,641
Are you sure you're OK?
- Yes. I must go.

371
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,249
Personnel shortages.

372
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,489
Give me a kiss.

373
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,046
Have you lived in
Helsinki a long time?

374
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,042
Almost four years now.

375
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,850
Where? - Downtown.
Smack in the center.

376
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,569
Close to the Bank of Finland.

377
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,128
At Ritarikatu.
- That's a nice place.

378
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,086
The guys at the precinct say
that you're doing a good job.

379
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:08,210
Yeah? Maybe I am.

380
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,410
You know these
streets pretty well...

381
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,444
Shit. No reflector!
- I thought he had one.

382
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,086
That was a close call.

383
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,161
I've got some hot coffee.
Want some? - Not for me.

384
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,964
You haven't taken
detective course yet?

385
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,571
I've been sort of tied up.

386
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:56,602
Hey, when
was Karl Marx born?

387
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,485
Sometime in the
last millennium.

388
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,010
In the 19th century.
You should know.

389
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,089
Hell!

390
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,486
This is 237, in pursuit
of a red Ford Sierra.

391
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,723
We're driving
on Sahaajankatu.

392
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,446
Moving at high speed, -

393
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,325
turning left

394
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,287
Take my car and go
straight to the precinct...

395
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,205
To all cars: suspected burglar
broke loose from a patrol, -

396
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,644
running towards -

397
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,241
the rail yard.

398
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,647
Probably armed.

399
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,771
Male, normally built, -

400
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,566
6 ft tall.

401
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,009
237 has a visual.

402
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,047
Suspect is running
for the rail yard.

403
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,490
Police! Freeze!

404
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,608
Stop! Police!

405
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:05,523
The chaos theory. A frightening
phrase. What does it mean?

406
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,211
We are all
familiar with chaos.

407
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,801
One look in the mirror
after the weekend.

408
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,765
My hair's a "chaos".

409
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:23,889
A leaking tap: the regular
rhythm of the falling drops -

410
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,289
suddenly going haywire...

411
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,966
Antti, have
you got a second?

412
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,442
Antti Arhama?

413
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,764
I'm afraid you must be prepared
for some very sad news.

414
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,488
Your wife was killed in
the line of duty last night.

415
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,767
She was crushed by a train
while in pursuit of a suspect.

416
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,411
The suspect is in custody.

417
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,684
We are not yet certain
that he was involved -

418
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,167
in your wife's death -

419
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:21,366
or even whether she was
pushed under the train.

420
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,288
Investigations
are in progress.

421
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,284
This is all I can tell.
My deepest sympathy.

422
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,364
Hi. You're early.

423
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:09,409
Tomorrow the class is going to
the zoo. Three euros each and...

424
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,606
Are we going shopping?
- Not right now.

425
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,803
Maybe later. - Why not?

426
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,483
We'll see.

427
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,728
Why don't
you take your coat off?

428
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,605
Why don't you
take your coat off.

429
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,206
You promised we would
buy some bubble-gum.

430
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,642
Can I play?

431
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,921
May I play? - Go ahead.

432
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,970
Kill!

433
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,489
Let's go and see granny!
- Kill, kill, kill.

434
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,362
Did you hear what I said?

435
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,365
To granny's! - Off we go.

436
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,371
If daddy says
we're going, we're going.

437
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,963
Big sisters are such a drag.

438
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,887
Go on. Go now.

439
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,287
Daddy. You're speeding.

440
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,570
Did you hear me?
You're speeding!

441
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:12,331
Daddy. You're going too
fast. Can you hear?

442
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,641
Why did we stop here?

443
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,248
Daddy.
You can't stop here.

444
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,845
Do you hear?
You can't stop here.

445
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,888
Daddy, do you hear?
- You can't stop here.

446
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,083
Hey, kids.

447
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,971
I want to take Niko in on this.

448
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,047
Can we trust him?
- Of course.

449
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,129
He's my childhood friend.

450
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,324
And he's only the driver.
- OK then.

451
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,003
You're cold?

452
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,409
Do you want to marry me?
- What?

453
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,204
Be my wife.

454
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,801
SNOWPILE

455
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:40,209
People talk
about Eco-catastrophes.

456
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,207
The population explosion.

457
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,561
The end is near.

458
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,684
Do you love her? - Yes.

459
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:06,369
That's good.
The kid coming and all.

460
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:13,728
Is it a boy or a girl?
- Too early to tell.

461
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:19,011
The main thing
is the baby's health.

462
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,844
Does it make any sense -

463
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,004
to bring babies
into a world like this?

464
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,290
Nice cake. - A special offer.

465
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,601
German. Paid for it in euros.

466
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:59,691
The end is near. - I guess.

467
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,410
Don't worry so much. - No.
I'm trying to talk to you.

468
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,327
But you look worried.
- If you would only listen to me.

469
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,483
It's about your family.
- You don't know my parents.

470
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:26,207
The way things are going, I
never will. - This is my call.

471
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,767
If something goes wrong, -

472
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,203
I don't want you to
know anything. - OK.

473
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,966
I'm not going to hurt anyone.

474
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,369
I get the feeling
you're trying to back off.

475
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,882
Things are different now.
You're pregnant.

476
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,569
Come right in.

477
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:29,331
Here's my dad's access
card and the keys.

478
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,647
Did you find what we need?

479
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,725
Yes. More than I expected.

480
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:39,523
Control camera angles
and all kinds of stuff.

481
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,204
I think it's a girl.

482
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:51,850
How can you tell?
- It's just how I feel

483
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,769
We need your help.

484
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,368
For something we've
been planning for a while.

485
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,603
Talk to me.

486
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:14,323
You have to get into a building.
- And you're the driver.

487
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,090
Who lives there?

488
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,203
It's an information
security company.

489
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,404
I need to get to their server.
- And what does that mean?

490
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,808
A lot of cash
passes through every day.

491
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,367
My old man is the MD.
- And?

492
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,770
We take from the rich and give
to the poor. - I'm pretty poor.

493
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,482
Are you in? - Am I?

494
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,641
What's in it for me?

495
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:44,322
What's my share?
Do I get something?

496
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,405
You get to be
a part of something big.

497
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,531
Very funny. Very funny.

498
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,722
Do you copy? Do you copy?

499
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,769
I CODY-

500
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,851
Fuck, what's with this?

501
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,204
Tuomas.

502
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,642
Do you copy?

503
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,522
Fuck.

504
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,085
I'm done.

505
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,602
Do you read me?

506
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,690
I can't hear you.
I have to come out soon.

507
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,610
I can't hear you.
I'm coming out now.

508
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,163
Wait!

509
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,804
Police! Freeze!

510
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,329
Hola! Como estas?

511
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,447
You waiting for someone?

512
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:22,082
How's your beer?
Is it good?

513
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,601
So, you like beer?

514
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,451
Can I get you something?

515
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,047
What do you want?

516
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,241
Do you like poetry?
Do you want to go to my place?

517
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,642
Mankind is
the crown of creation.

518
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,322
Niko. I want to introduce
you to a friend of mine...

519
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,481
Let's just be friends

520
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:45,284
Put your clothes on.

521
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,810
First give me a kiss!

522
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:23,086
After the war 129 police officers
have been killed in the line of duty

523
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,087
The chase ended with a
tragic death in the rail yard.

524
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,291
She was a
respected police officer

525
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,251
Elina Oravisto? - Yes.

526
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,042
Criminal investigations.

527
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,964
How long have your
parents been in Thailand?

528
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,844
A few weeks.
- Where exactly?

529
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,566
Have you been there?
- Yes. In Phuket.

530
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,444
They're in Pattaya.

531
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,610
Your father doesn't know
this Tuomas? - No.

532
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,651
How is that?

533
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:11,728
They've never met. - Do your
parents know you're dating him?

534
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,771
No. - Why do
you want to hide it?

535
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,923
My parents are so
different from him.

536
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:28,201
Why did he raid your father's
company? - I don't know.

537
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,090
Did you help him? - No.

538
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:34,365
Tuomas is in the EDP business.
- He has his own company.

539
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:39,646
There must be other parties
involved. Any ideas? - No.

540
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,047
Does he belong to any
organizations? - No

541
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:45,801
Does he have any
enemies? - No.

542
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,891
Did you give him
the access codes?

543
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,051
No. I don't even
know them myself.

544
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:00,168
You might be an accomplice.
- On what grounds?

545
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,007
Tuomas may have
murdered a police officer.

546
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,209
Do you understand how
serious this is for you?

547
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,209
I need to get high.

548
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,411
He's fine.
- How do you know?

549
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,768
Tuomas can handle anything.

550
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,288
It can't be my fault.
They can't accuse me.

551
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:16,889
Patrols and German shepherds
all over the fucking place.

552
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,321
What are those?

553
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,411
They're a bit <i>like...</i>

554
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,489
They're downers.

555
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,411
Good for depression.
Have one.

556
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,241
She's not breathing too well.

557
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:09,168
Saturation 87. And decreasing.

558
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,650
What's the blood pressure?

559
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,845
80 over 40. She needs
a drip. In both arms.

560
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,969
Prepare to pump her stomach.

561
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:25,331
The patient is in her twenties.

562
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,125
She's not dying?

563
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,604
POLICE

564
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:13,011
Why can't we go over there?
- You just can't. Cut it out!

565
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:16,410
Kids aren't allowed in there.

566
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,286
We cannot comprehend
the power of evil, -

567
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,369
the power of death.

568
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,804
Why is our society
not free of evil?

569
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:13,927
Why are there victims -

570
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:17,283
who must suffer for
the actions of others?

571
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:21,644
Yet the riddle of
evil is not outside us.

572
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,246
The line between
right and wrong -

573
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:32,002
divides us but it is
also within ourselves.

574
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:38,489
Who can we depend upon?

575
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:43,649
We seem to be powerless
in the face of death.

576
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:49,611
Yet even sorrow
can bring us strength.

577
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:55,724
Through it, we
can search for a reality -

578
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,888
which is
greater than any of us.

579
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,327
Darling Hannele.

580
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,647
Why did you leave
us alone so soon?

581
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,488
What made you do it?

582
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,490
What could you possibly
have thought to gain from it?

583
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:54,086
Let's start again
from the beginning.

584
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,328
How did you get into Certum -

585
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:59,444
if you didn't get
any help from anyone?

586
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,602
Why did you go there? What
were you looking for there?

587
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,883
I wanted to... - What?

588
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:13,042
What makes the world go round?
- What? Why did you go there?

589
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:18,404
We are going to keep going
through this until we get answers.

590
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,247
Who was there with you?

591
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,122
Answer!

592
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,969
The accused, Tuomas Saraste,
was breaking and entering.

593
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,608
And while evading capture -

594
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,121
he attacked a police officer -

595
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:39,364
and pushed
her under a moving train.

596
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,088
Furthermore the
engine driver states: -

597
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:48,200
<i>they fought and then</i> -

598
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:53,930
<i>he violently pushed
the officer onto the tracks.</i>

599
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:00,881
<i>There is very
little one can do...</i>

600
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:06,446
My client pleads
"not guilty" to murder -

601
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:11,328
but "guilty" to
breaking and entering -

602
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,488
and involuntary
manslaughter.

603
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:17,651
The verdict of this court
states that the accused, -

604
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,446
Tuomas Mikael Saraste -

605
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:25,851
is guilty of
breaking and entering.

606
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:32,647
The court does not
find him guilty of murder, -

607
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:37,926
rather, the accused
is convicted of -

608
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:42,523
manslaughter.

609
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:49,166
This is based on the affidavits
and police investigations.

610
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,166
The sentence is eight
years and six months -

611
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,682
in the penitentiary.

612
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:06,008
From this sentence he has
already served 185 days.

613
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,930
Furthermore, he must
pay the victim's children -

614
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:16,444
2600 euros as compensation
for their mental suffering.

615
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,286
Arhamo's claim
has been rejected.

616
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,090
The court is adjourned.

617
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:29,289
Is that all! A few years.
- We must appeal.

618
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:41,963
He only got few years.
Did he say eight?

619
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,681
Was that it? - I'm sorry.

620
01:39:56,040 --> 01:40:00,602
Was that all? Is that
the best you can do?

621
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,407
He murdered my wife!

622
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:08,651
I'm sorry. - He should
get the electric chair.

623
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:23,284
The termination
of your employment, -

624
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:26,962
who was the initiator?
- The employer.

625
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,847
The house is your own?
- Yes.

626
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,527
Well, 50% belongs to the bank.

627
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:38,930
We don't do
loan repayments.

628
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:43,611
Calculations indicate -

629
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:48,846
a monthly deficit of
41 euros. - Right.

630
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:02,169
Cash or credit?
- I have this document.

631
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,565
I'm not sure we take these.

632
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:17,329
Do we accept
social security vouchers?

633
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:24,370
No. - They should be
OK in all supermarkets.

634
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:28,686
Not in this one.
Maybe somewhere else.

635
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:34,049
Have you opened that already?
- The kids are eating the candy.

636
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,926
You don't have any cash?
- Not on me at the moment.

637
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:42,766
How about
a trip to the ATM?

638
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,170
I'll pay you later for
the candy. - Well, OK.

639
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,244
Maybe you should
use the other counter.

640
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,531
Some for me too.
- Move the spoon.

641
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,202
This is yummy.

642
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,204
How long ago did your
wife die? - About a year.

643
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,891
You got some crisis help
then? - Yes.

644
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,681
And the kids too?

645
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,249
We all went
together a few times.

646
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:40,489
Good.

647
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,286
How have you been lately?

648
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,046
Not so well.

649
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:52,003
What sort of symptoms?

650
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:58,286
Sort of... outbursts.

651
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,450
Outbursts?
What do you mean?

652
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:07,643
Quite... violent

653
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:12,411
Violent outbursts?
What are they?

654
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:15,925
I seem to lose it.

655
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,450
Can you be
more specific, please?

656
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,442
They're quite violent.

657
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,447
And you have 3 kids. - Yes.

658
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:39,487
How about a prescription?
Tranquilizers?

659
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:45,961
Maybe something
to help me sleep.

660
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:49,650
You have trouble getting
sleep? - Yes.

661
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:52,850
What is troubling you most?

662
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,646
I simply can't...

663
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:02,924
I can't get over my
wife's death... not yet.

664
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,450
How is that?

665
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:13,247
I keep thinking
about her death.

666
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:19,087
Getting over a loss of a loved
one could take a long time.

667
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,367
That's what they say.

668
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,208
Kill! Kill!

669
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,210
Daddy, why are we born?

670
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,162
Why was I born?
- You want to know?

671
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:06,811
Some people believe
that God created us.

672
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,164
What the hell is this again?

673
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:15,443
Jaakko started it.
- Shut up!

674
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,761
Do you want me
to take you outside?

675
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:23,042
Let go of my hair! - You
disgust me. God damn it.

676
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,004
It was an accident.

677
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:28,966
Now the teachers know that
my son beats up his friends.

678
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:31,481
It was an accident!
- Shut up!!

679
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:34,684
Daddy, don't hit! - Fuck!

680
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:57,011
Welfare office?

681
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:04,201
Put me through to someone
who deals with family violence.

682
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:15,249
Hello? Antti Arhamo here.

683
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:20,765
I would like to ask...

684
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:25,080
I have three kids -

685
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,765
and I hit
one of them quite hard.

686
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,649
Yes, at home

687
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,446
Say good-bye to your father.

688
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:05,604
Bye, daddy. Bye.
- Konsta?

689
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:09,126
Give your dad a hug.

690
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,930
I'm sorry, Konsta.
- Forget it.

691
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:21,920
I love you.
- I love you too.

692
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,931
THE LAST MISTAKE
- five years later -

693
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:46,088
Business closed.

694
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:50,961
Why don't they
stop doing that stuff?

695
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,762
That's a good question.

696
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:59,084
Are humans born innocent?

697
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:07,323
And if we are,
how is ill feeling born?

698
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,646
Next I want everyone to think back
to a situation in your own lives, -

699
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:17,641
where you have passed your
ill feeling to someone else

700
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,484
A friend of mine...

701
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,164
My best friend
is getting out soon.

702
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:42,446
I'm a little nervous
ans scared about it.

703
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,481
He hasn't...

704
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,767
He hasn't been in touch -

705
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:57,161
with his ex-girlfriend.

706
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:01,445
I've been seeing her, Elina.

707
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:05,081
We're friends.

708
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:10,171
I've a clear
conscience about it.

709
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:14,971
We have just spend -

710
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:18,164
a lot of time together.

711
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:24,845
I'd like my father here.
He's in poor shape.

712
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:31,123
The best dad,
but now in bad way.

713
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:46,287
I'm very happy to be
here. Thank you.

714
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:52,805
My name is Anna.
And I'm an addict.

715
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:56,407
Prison area.
No trespassing.

716
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:30,851
Good mash, isn't it?
- Pretty good.

717
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,607
Real potatoes

718
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:37,924
What's your plan?
- No idea.

719
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:42,683
You should
get in touch with them.

720
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,687
After all, he's your son.

721
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:49,929
And he needs a father.
- Drop it.

722
01:52:56,240 --> 01:53:01,406
If you run now, you have
to face it later. - So?

723
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,082
What's your next step?

724
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,645
This is for you.

725
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,366
Give me a break.
- Just take it.

726
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:16,281
Besides it's real.

727
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:21,926
I'm doing okay.

728
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,810
This is a start.

729
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:29,091
A new beginning.

730
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:32,727
To everything.
- If you say so.

731
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:38,962
Mommy?

732
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:48,126
What's up, sweetie?
- I had a bad dream.

733
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:51,965
Let's go back to bed.
I'll tuck you in.

734
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:55,524
I heard voices.

735
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:59,968
I thought you'd
meet him a bit later.

736
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:04,285
Who is that?
- Let's go and see.

737
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:16,163
Hi. - Hi.

738
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:24,082
Are you my daddy? - Yes.

739
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,882
Good.

740
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,687
I need to do pee-pee.

741
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:03,046
Say "good night" to daddy.
- Good night.

742
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:11,164
Let's put you
under the blankets.

743
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:46,281
I suppose you'd better go.

744
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,723
Hey young fella!

745
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:18,802
Gotta spare coin?
For a phone call?

746
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:23,129
Thanks.
Happy Midsummer!

747
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:08,523
Come inside.

748
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:23,765
You'll have to
excuse the mess in here.

749
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,525
Coffee? - Yes please.

750
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:53,729
I'm out of milk.
- Black is fine.

751
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:09,524
I can tell that you believe
that I did it. But I didn't.

752
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:35,687
You have beautiful kids.

753
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:40,562
Yeah.

754
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:47,406
What's the little one called?
- That's Jonttu.

755
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,089
Joonatan.

756
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:05,401
Where are they now?

757
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,890
What? - The kids.
At school?

758
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,609
Where else?

759
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:18,083
Marja is just about to
graduate. A smart girl.

760
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:27,169
Wanna visit Hannele's grave?

761
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:12,606
It was what she wanted.
- Now it's frozen?

762
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:15,288
Just like then.

763
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:36,250
Don't do it. Don't do it.

764
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:41,129
I never wanted this to happen.

765
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:48,525
Do you remember the questions
we asked each other as kids?

766
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:52,646
Why am I who I am?
Why was I born here?

767
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:58,330
Why can't I scream
when I feel bad?

768
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:04,683
What's the point of living if
this life is merely hell?

769
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:08,009
But we have to believe, -

770
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:11,886
that in the end things
work out for the best

771
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:18,090
Otherwise, nothing
makes any sense
