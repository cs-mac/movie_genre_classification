1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,919
Perhaps some day

2
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,679
you will understand

3
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,479
how much I cried,

4
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,519
I begged on my knees

5
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,639
to those poor bastards.

6
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,359
That night I screamed,

7
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,199
the hills echoed

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,239
and people laughed.

9
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,159
I fought with my pain saying...

10
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,759
"A bitch with rabies must"

11
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,039
have given birth to you.

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,119
And that is why you have

13
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,359
eaten her breasts.

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,239
Now you can swallow me,

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,879
now you can devour me,

16
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,039
"as you did your mother."

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,799
This woman who sings

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,559
was grabbed,

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,759
was raped that night.

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,519
They didn't care about

21
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,119
my unborn daughter.

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,999
They raped me with their
penis and hands,

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,319
with no pity for my daughter

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,839
watching them from inside.

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,839
And not satisfied with that,

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,839
they made me swallow the dead penis

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,559
of my husband Josefo.

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,919
His poor dead penis seasoned
with gunpowder.

29
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,199
With that pain I screamed:

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,279
"You better kill me"

31
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,039
and bury me with my Josefo.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,079
"I feel lost here."

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,559
Every time you remember...

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,279
when you cry, Mother...

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,959
you stain your bed with

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,599
sweat and tears of sorrow.

37
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,079
You haven't eaten anything.

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,639
If you don't want any,
just tell me.

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,319
I won't prepare anything.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,559
Na, komm.

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,439
I'll eat

42
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,759
if you sing to me,

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,359
and freshen

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,199
my drying memory.

45
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,119
I don't see my memories,

46
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,959
it's as if I no longer lived.

47
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,319
Come on...

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,759
Sit up.

49
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,959
You're worn out

50
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,839
like a dead bird.

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,039
I am going to make up

52
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,919
your bed a little.

53
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,399
Mama.

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,679
Mama?

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,199
THE MILK OF SORROW

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,279
Hurry or you'll be late.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,679
Jonatan, come help your sister.

58
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,079
Jonatan!
- Coming!

59
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,199
Can't you hear me?

60
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
Jonatan, Mama is calling you.

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,759
What do you want?

62
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,119
Help me with my veil.

63
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,519
Take the tip, but carefully!

64
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,359
Look, Dad. My train is short.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,559
I want more material.

66
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,919
More material? Who'll pay for it?

67
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,159
You, Dad. Aren't you my father?

68
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,839
Okay, but I think it's too long.

69
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,279
Dad, it's short.
Can't you see it's short?

70
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,879
Out!
I think it looks fine.

71
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,399
Jonatan, grab the tip.

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,839
Look, you're getting it all dirty!

73
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,479
It's not that dirty.
- Shake it!

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,279
It's not that dirty!
- Shake it off, son.

75
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,239
Dad, I want
two or three more meters.

76
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,839
It's huge!

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,399
How can it be huge?

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,759
Máxima, I have no material left.

79
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,559
Get out of here, Chicho!

80
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,319
You won't be happy until
you finish staining my dress.

81
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,719
But, baby, it's just fine!

82
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,079
You're exaggerating.

83
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,359
Dad, I'm your only daughter...
- Okay, but...

84
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,759
Besides, I'm only getting
married once...

85
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,599
Immer auf den letzten Drücker.

86
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,239
I have no money,

87
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,879
I've given it all to your mother!

88
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,239
Fausta, it's short, isn't it?

89
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,359
It needs more material!

90
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,159
Try some ornaments.

91
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,639
My veil! Shit, Mom!

92
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,879
Baby it's long and pretty.
Faustita, tell her it's okay.

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,039
Just talk, say something. Faustita.

94
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,639
Use more ornaments, that's all.
- Shut up!

95
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,439
Faustita, are you okay?

96
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,599
Mom, Fausta is bleeding again!

97
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,919
You're bleeding! Fausta!

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,799
Your full name?

99
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,479
Where is my uncle?

100
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,839
Your name, please.

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,039
Fausta Isidora Huamán Chauca.

102
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,239
Single?

103
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,519
Yes.

104
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,599
Virgin?

105
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,399
I don't know.

106
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,879
This has nothing to do with

107
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,519
her bleeding or fainting.

108
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,359
It's a rather strange,
unusual case.

109
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,719
I've seen similar cases,

110
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,719
but in women older than Fausta,

111
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,479
with a placenta previa.

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,639
Which isn't Fausta's case.

113
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,679
Fausta has a tuber in her vagina.

114
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,359
A potato, to be exact.

115
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,119
She hasn't let us treat her.

116
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,999
She's rather upset.

117
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,439
Are you her husband?

118
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,999
I'm her uncle.

119
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,679
You weren't aware, were you?

120
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,039
She's bled since she was a child,

121
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,959
when she's scared.

122
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,519
Her mother,

123
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,439
she just passed away,

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,599
and that's why she fainted.

125
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,599
She lived through very hard
times in the village.

126
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,439
Fausta was born during terrorism.

127
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,639
And her mother transmitted her

128
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,479
fear through her breast milk.

129
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,119
The "milk of sorrow",

130
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,759
as we call anyone born that way...

131
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,119
without a soul

132
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,479
because it hid underground out of fear.

133
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,279
There is no illness like this

134
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,479
in Lima, is there, doctor?

135
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,079
I mean, did you know your niece

136
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,079
had a potato in her vagina?

137
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,959
Oh, no, I didn't know about that.

138
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,399
It must have gotten in there by itself.

139
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,079
There's lots of food at home.

140
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,679
Fausta's uterus is inflamed.

141
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,439
That is dangerous because she
could have more infections.

142
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,079
Evidently, as the potato grows,

143
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,159
the bacteria will increase.

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,759
What do you mean by growing, doctor?

145
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,159
Have you seen a potato
saved for a long time?

146
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,439
It's the same, the roots protrude

147
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,959
from the vaginal area.

148
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,199
The bleeding isn't related.

149
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,119
Her capillary vessels

150
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,559
are very superficial.

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,639
With a simple operation they are

152
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,039
cauterized and that's the end of it.

153
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,999
She bleeds because of the illness,

154
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,319
because of the milk of sorrow.

155
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,679
She was born that way, no potatoes.

156
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,399
How can we harvest potatoes
from a vagina?

157
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,519
The illness of the milk of sorrow,

158
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,399
or whatever, doesn't exist,

159
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,879
and much less transmitted
by a mother's milk.

160
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,639
Here is a document so
as to have her admitted.

161
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,439
Later we can talk about

162
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,919
a real contraceptive.

163
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,679
Thank you, doctor.

164
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,159
Uncle, that doctor knows nothing.

165
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,599
It's not a birth control method,
I know that!

166
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,599
I am not ignorant.

167
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,799
I'd prefer that...

168
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,999
Don't tell my aunt,

169
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,519
she won't understand it.

170
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,519
And you must respect me.

171
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,079
Mom told me that during the

172
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,199
terrorism, a neighbour did it

173
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,439
so as not to be raped.

174
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,759
They said it was disgusting.

175
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,519
I thought she was the smartest.

176
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,079
Then she got married, had 4 kids,

177
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,919
and didn't have to live with a rapist.

178
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,959
These are other times.

179
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,439
In Lima it's different.
Things have changed.

180
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,999
No one will hurt you.

181
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,079
You came to Lima very young.

182
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,359
Mom told me everything!

183
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,799
Your mother is dead, dead!

184
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,439
My uncle doesn't understand me, Mom.

185
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,079
This is my protection.

186
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,359
I saw it all from your belly.

187
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,959
I felt the slashing of your body.

188
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
That is why I now wear this

189
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,679
in me like a shield,

190
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,479
like a stopper.

191
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,639
Because only revulsion

192
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,919
stops revolting people.

193
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,159
Uncle,

194
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,879
I have to take her to the village.

195
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,439
With what money?

196
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,079
Don't you worry, Uncle.

197
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,719
I must wash your clothes well

198
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,399
so you won't go

199
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,959
back to the village with me

200
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,519
smelling of sadness.

201
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,079
The contract includes all services.
Coffin, chapel,

202
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,599
and carriage for 600 soles.
That's the best I can do.

203
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,439
The coffin comes with the ornaments.

204
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,559
We want the coffin

205
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,439
and carriage, but in the province.

206
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,479
To the province? That will cost you.

207
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,039
The coffin, carriage and paperwork,

208
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,159
800 soles complete.

209
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
Not even if it were a limousine.

210
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,999
Brother, this is a first-rate

211
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,359
service I am offering you.

212
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,759
Look at the coffin, and the ornaments.

213
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,519
You can see the finish on it...

214
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,839
This is the Imperial model.

215
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,159
Besides, I'm the owner here.

216
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,479
Here's my card.

217
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,239
Well, but you cannot have it.
It's the last one I have.

218
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,519
Now it's up to you.

219
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,439
Come this way, we have more coffins.

220
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,599
This one is for fanatics.

221
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,439
For sportsmen. For patriots.

222
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,079
"For God and the country."

223
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,439
This one's for those

224
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,279
who miss the land. Look, pure oak.

225
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,919
Some bring a picture of their
loved one

226
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,359
so as to be together.

227
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,519
And that one is for peace.

228
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,199
It's the Pacific ocean that
lightens their loads

229
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,159
and washes their sorrow.

230
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,599
That's hot, Papi!

231
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,079
That's great for when I die. How much?

232
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,079
500 soles each. It's all handmade.

233
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,199
But figure about 700

234
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,199
for any special iob.

235
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,919
I remember once my sister-in-law

236
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,959
took her father on the state bus.

237
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,079
She put the boxwith the luggage.

238
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,919
Maybe you can too.

239
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,719
Or I can rent you a grave
for one night.

240
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,439
We can remove her the next day

241
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,599
and you find a cheaper place.

242
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,479
Ask Jonatan to do you
a chignon for the wedding.

243
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,559
They're in style.

244
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,999
That puts years on you.

245
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,679
I want my hair loose, like Thalia.

246
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,719
In the TV novel she wears a chignon.

247
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,559
Like in "The Wild Rose".

248
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,879
Did it make her look older?

249
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,239
But I don't like it, Mom!

250
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,919
I was just telling you...

251
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,319
Zonia is written
with an "S".

252
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,999
What will the client say?

253
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,759
She can't read.

254
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,879
It's getting away, Mom!

255
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,479
It's getting away!

256
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,319
Be careful! Get that pigeon, please.

257
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,679
They got away!

258
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,439
Severina, pass me the oil,

259
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,999
and don't burn yourself.

260
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,959
This is making me sick.

261
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,639
Sick or not sick, we've helped so many
preserve their dead.

262
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,959
How could we prove their existence?

263
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,679
We didn't even have a picture,
or an ID card.

264
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,879
We had no proof of being born,

265
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,319
and much less of being killed.

266
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,439
Here go over her breasts,

267
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,999
I don't want to be infected,
it might be contagious.

268
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,919
They're looking for someone
for the Big House,

269
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,279
nights only.

270
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,879
You could go, make money

271
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,719
and take your Mom to the village.

272
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,519
You might ask for an advance.

273
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,319
But you will have to go alone.

274
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,039
What do you say?

275
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,119
Are you sure?

276
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,239
She never goes anywhere alone.

277
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,679
I accept, Auntie.

278
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,239
Okay, honey,

279
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,439
you needed that, didn't you?

280
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,639
Where are you going?

281
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,439
I am going to heaven

282
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,319
to water flowers,

283
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,919
to water flowers.

284
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,479
Where are you going?

285
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,159
I am going to heaven

286
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,719
to water flowers,

287
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,239
to water flowers.

288
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,519
Where are you going?

289
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,079
I am going to heaven

290
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,759
to water flowers,

291
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,079
to water flowers.

292
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,799
Don't worry,

293
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,119
Fina is my friend and she will help you.

294
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,959
I'm going to prepare
Carvaial's wedding.

295
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,399
Hi, I'm glad you're here.

296
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,039
I was waiting.

297
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,999
You're a bit late.

298
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,319
Come in, Fausta, come in.

299
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,959
I'm sorry about your Mom.

300
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,119
I'm having bad luck too.

301
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,679
But, that's life, dear!

302
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,519
I forgot. Good heavens!

303
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,439
Mrs. Aida says there is no advance.

304
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,559
She doesn't do these things.

305
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,359
There's no way.

306
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,639
And as I was saying,

307
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,359
my son is in jail.

308
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,559
Can you imagine?

309
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,799
I hope he doesn't
get raped in prison.

310
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,359
But he must have done something

311
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,639
to have these problems. What a shame!

312
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,039
He says no, but he must
have done something.

313
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,439
He can't tell me he didn't!

314
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,879
What do they think?

315
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,359
Now I have to take care of
my grandchildren at night.

316
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,119
Why must I be in this situation?

317
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,999
You can leave at seven o'clock.

318
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,359
The gardener comes before
you leave,

319
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,999
he is Noé.

320
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,399
Before opening the door,

321
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,199
ask if it's him.

322
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,239
If it isn't,

323
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,359
please don't open
the door for anyone else.

324
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,759
I recommend staying inside

325
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,639
because, as you know,

326
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,959
delinquency is terrible right now

327
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,079
and if you open the door,

328
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,719
they could empty the house.

329
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,639
Hurry up, dear, hurry up.

330
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,639
Hurry!

331
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,079
Let's see those ears.

332
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,679
That's okay. Now your mouth.

333
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,839
Show me your teeth, please.

334
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,079
Let's see those teeth.

335
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,279
And that neck.

336
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,719
You're pretty sweaty.

337
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,559
You'll have to have a bath anyway.

338
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,159
Show me your hands.

339
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,319
Spread your fingers, please.

340
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,439
Oh, well, they're clean.

341
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,919
Your other hand.

342
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,159
Here you have a long fingernail.
Why, what happened?

343
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,319
Why didn't you cut it?

344
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,719
You should know that for these things,

345
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,479
Mrs. Aída could lose interest.

346
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,079
Here is your uniform.

347
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,199
You've got soap,

348
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,239
scissors for you fingernails, shampoo,

349
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,079
and deodorant, which is obligatory daily,

350
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,759
after your bath, your deodorant.

351
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,319
She gives you mimosas

352
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,359
because she's very good.

353
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,639
After your bath, you'll wait
in the kitchen.

354
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,119
If she needs you, she'll call.

355
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,439
If she doesn't,

356
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,039
just stay in your kitchen.

357
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,159
Fina.

358
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,039
Fina!

359
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,599
Finita!

360
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,159
Take this.

361
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,439
My name is Fausta.

362
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,839
What?

363
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,119
Fausta Isidora.
Mrs. Fina told me...

364
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,479
Oh, yes, now I remember.

365
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,159
Hand me that picture.

366
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,599
Let us sing, let us sing.

367
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,079
Let us sing pretty things.

368
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,919
To hide our fear,
pretend it doesn't exist.

369
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,839
Let us sing, let us sing.

370
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,719
Let us sing pretty things.

371
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,679
To hide our fear,

372
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,279
conceal our wound,

373
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,119
pretend it doesn't exist...

374
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,599
Who is it?

375
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,159
Me.
- Me, who?

376
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,839
Noé, the gardener.

377
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,839
Let me see your hands.

378
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,279
Long life to the bride and groom!
Viva!

379
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,519
Smile,

380
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,879
you're not going to the slaughterhouse.

381
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,999
They think they're commiting suicide.

382
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,039
Bravo, bravo!

383
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,519
The kiss, the kiss!

384
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,799
Bravo! Bravo! Applause!

385
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,799
The kiss, the kiss!

386
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,279
The kiss. Is there no kiss?

387
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,679
The kiss!

388
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,359
Everyone applaud, this isn't a cemetery!

389
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,039
Let them dance. Music, please!

390
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,519
Very close together.

391
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,759
Smile Héctor and Hermelinda.

392
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,079
Have the bride's family come in.

393
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,399
Cheese! One, two, three,
the picture!

394
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,359
Here we go.

395
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,879
Have the bride's family come in.

396
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,279
Smile, everyone.
Stay close together.

397
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,279
Ready? Cheese!

398
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,079
One, two, three... picture!

399
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,559
Now the groom's family.
Get close together...

400
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,079
The groom's family, please.

401
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,199
Everyone smiling. That's it...

402
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,119
Are you all ready?

403
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,599
Cheese. One, two, three... picture!

404
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,959
Hello, hello. Testing, one, two three.

405
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,799
Be careful,

406
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,719
don't trip.

407
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,479
Where is the buffet going?

408
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,039
It's only a mobile buffet.

409
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,559
They have left only chips.

410
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,919
This is the highlight
of "Bodas Chic".

411
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,439
We do wonderful, quality weddings,

412
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,599
within your budgets!

413
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,279
The groom should be more cheerful!

414
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,319
Nowwith your cousins!

415
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,679
Nowwith the old folk!

416
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,239
Did you get the advance

417
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,319
at the Big House?

418
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,839
At the end of the month, she said.

419
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,479
I want no dead people

420
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,519
or sad memories at Máxima's wedding.

421
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,039
You must take Perpetua away

422
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,999
before the wedding.

423
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,039
If not, I'll bury her myself.
Understand?

424
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,039
Round trip? What dates?

425
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,679
Give me the price for a package

426
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,079
and my return trip.

427
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,359
How many people?
- One, sir.

428
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,079
And a coffin.
- What, a coffin?

429
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,479
You had to tell him.
- Are you pulling my leg?

430
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,879
It's a piece of baggage.

431
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,399
There's a donkey for that.

432
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,759
Just move on.
Next! Name?

433
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,519
Wait, can't you see I'm pregnant?

434
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,879
I've had to buy a new piano.

435
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,319
And the other one?

436
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,239
Did it fall out the window by itself?

437
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,479
Yes.

438
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,679
Mom, you left me four messages saying

439
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,159
the premiere is in a week

440
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,879
and you have nothing.

441
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,559
Now I'm here and you act like
everything is fine.

442
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,559
You worry me.

443
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,719
Don't worry, there's nothing
you can do.

444
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,039
That's normal. What do you think?

445
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,079
Isidra, leave it right there.

446
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,119
They're cold.

447
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,519
I'll do it. Sit down.

448
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,679
You were singing a song yesterday.

449
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,439
Sing it again.

450
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,519
I heard you, don't be shy.

451
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,559
I can't, Madam.

452
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,319
Right.

453
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,279
Bring it to my room.

454
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,079
Isidra, come help me.

455
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,479
My necklace has broken.

456
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,199
If you sing, I'll give you a pearl.

457
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,239
If you complete the necklace,
it's yours.

458
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,599
Who is it?

459
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,679
The piano fell.

460
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,239
It's broken, but it still sings.

461
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,359
Can't you hear it?

462
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,959
And these look like coloured sweets.

463
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,599
It's whole and very thin.

464
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,359
It will be a long life

465
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,599
full of love and hope.

466
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,759
Bravo!
- Bravo!

467
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,159
Well, today I will speak

468
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,799
in the name and heart of

469
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,039
my cousin Marcos, Don Lúcido.

470
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,079
With this act

471
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,919
we've confirmed that Máxima
is worthy of marriage,

472
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,759
and that was a gnarled and

473
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,799
very difficult potato, sir.

474
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,439
We wanted to ask

475
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,359
for your permission.

476
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,599
We have a date for the church.

477
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,199
Perhaps you could lend us something,

478
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,519
a little economic help
to carry it out

479
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,359
and to build a roof for our house.

480
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,719
You will no longer have to
take care of Máxima.

481
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,639
My maximum love.

482
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,079
Well, those are the sincere wishes

483
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,119
of my beloved cousin Marcos,
Don Lúcido.

484
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,519
Bravo!

485
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,399
Hey, listen, your cousin is hot.

486
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,519
Didn't I tell you she's ill?

487
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,359
She suffers from the tit illness.

488
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,879
She looks fine to me.

489
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,199
You're crazy.

490
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,959
Can I sit down?
- Sure, sit down.

491
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,079
I'm going for milk.

492
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,039
I bet many guys flirt with you.

493
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,079
Yeah, I'm sure.

494
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,519
Maybe something like
"You're a nice piece..."

495
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,279
if red is the color of passion,

496
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,999
bathe me in your menstruation...

497
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,919
Just call me and I'll kick their asses.

498
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,439
Just let me know.

499
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,039
I'm watering the garden again.

500
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,759
That calms me down.

501
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,279
No.

502
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,079
I've done that concert for 20 years
and I won't miss it.

503
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,519
Not even stark raving mad. I'll show up,

504
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,599
even just to play the funeral march!

505
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,599
Yes.

506
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,919
Wednesday.

507
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,719
Nowwhat?

508
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,759
900 soles, Madam.

509
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,399
You must be out of your mind!

510
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,319
How can you charge that?

511
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,079
I'll never call you again,
you're too expensive.

512
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,199
The job is worth that.

513
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,799
Too expensive. Impossible, I can't.

514
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,679
I'll stay several days
until the job is done.

515
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,639
An optimum iob,
first-rate materials.

516
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,679
At a special price for you.

517
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,799
I only have 700.

518
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,879
Since you always hire me,

519
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,319
Madam, 750 soles.

520
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,999
I'll be right back.

521
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,519
Isidra, is that your name?
- Don't bother the girl.

522
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,079
Let's get to work.

523
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,839
Hi, Faustita.

524
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,799
Máxima sent me to pick you up.

525
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,039
She didn't tell me.

526
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,439
Máxima is "busy" with Marcos.

527
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,639
And since you don't like to
walk alone,

528
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,479
I volunteered.

529
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,879
That's what friends are for.
- I'll wait here.

530
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,679
Faustita, did you make me
come on a whim?

531
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,039
I'll wait.

532
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,399
Good morning.
- Good morning.

533
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,159
You'll have to go back all alone.

534
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,639
Could I have a glass of water?

535
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,239
I'll take you home.

536
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,799
Take me where?
- Home.

537
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,439
No, I'm fine.

538
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,519
In my village you have to

539
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,799
walk very close to the wall.

540
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,279
If not, you get caught by

541
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,199
the lost souls and could die.

542
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,439
My brother died of that.

543
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,719
He was as thin as a skeleton

544
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,679
for not paying attention

545
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,119
to the lost souls.

546
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,359
He had terrible stomach aches.

547
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,719
Mom was on the farm.

548
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,759
And Grandfather in town,

549
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,159
selling animals.

550
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,879
Nowwe only have

551
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,519
a picture of his stomach.

552
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,999
That's all we have left.

553
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,439
An X-ray?

554
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,039
Yes, that's it.

555
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,199
We're almost at my place.

556
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,719
It's there, on the corner.

557
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,479
I'll stay here.

558
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,239
But I'll be watching

559
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,319
until you get there.

560
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,159
Auntie! Auntie! A swimming pool!

561
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,839
Let's see

562
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,559
if they recognize you

563
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,879
when we reach the village.

564
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,159
I will carry you on my back

565
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,799
like you did when I was a baby.

566
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,959
My papa will no longer

567
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,799
be alone with the maggots...

568
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,119
In my village they say

569
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,319
that musicians have a

570
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,679
secret contract with a mermaid.

571
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,599
For their music to be heard

572
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,479
more than always,

573
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,799
more than ever.

574
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,319
If theywant to know

575
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,359
how long the agreement lasts,

576
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,919
they must pick from a dark field

577
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,919
a handfull of quinoa,

578
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,279
and give it to the mermaid.

579
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,919
And so

580
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,639
she starts counting.

581
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,639
They say each grain

582
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,919
means a year.

583
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,439
So when the mermaid

584
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,199
finishes counting

585
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,399
she takes the musician

586
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,599
and throws him

587
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,439
into the sea.

588
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,799
But my mother says,

589
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,079
says, says

590
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,999
quinoa grains are

591
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,359
too difficult to count

592
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,239
and the mermaid gets worn out,

593
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,759
so the musician can keep

594
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,679
his talent forever.

595
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,159
You need comforting.
- Why?

596
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,839
There's geraniums, hydrangea, iasmin...

597
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,319
You choose daisies. For comfort.

598
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,599
Plants tell the truth.

599
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,519
They're not like people.

600
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,079
In the stems and blossoms

601
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,359
are the plant's life and memories.

602
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,079
The earth must be stirred

603
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,799
from top to bottom,

604
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,959
so the sun doesn't always

605
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,959
burn the same layer.

606
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,039
If not you get a crust and

607
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,159
the plant dries quickly.

608
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,239
I know that.

609
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,759
I had a small

610
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,799
vegetable garden
in my village.

611
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,839
My little

612
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,439
lost dove,

613
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:07,279
you ran away out of fear

614
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,639
and you lost your soul,

615
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,039
little dove.

616
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,519
I'm sure your mother brought you

617
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,679
into the world during the war,

618
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,519
and perhaps your mother

619
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,079
gave birth to you with fear.

620
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,159
Even if they

621
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,599
hurt you there,

622
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,519
you shouldn't walk crying,

623
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,439
there's no reason

624
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,279
to walk suffering.

625
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,079
Search for, look for

626
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,119
your lost soul

627
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,279
look for it in the darkness,

628
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,119
look for it in the earth...

629
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,199
Little birds, little birds...

630
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,719
Not this one, sing the mermaid one.

631
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,039
I can't remember. I make them up.

632
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,679
Okay, make it up again,
but exactly the same.

633
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,119
...a mermaid.

634
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,039
From a dark field you must pick

635
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,599
a handful of quinoa

636
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,759
for the mermaid.

637
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,359
And so

638
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,359
the mermaid counts it all.

639
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,559
The mermaid says

640
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,079
that each grain...

641
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,559
What is this?

642
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,959
This was my doll.

643
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,359
They said if I buried it,

644
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,519
the earth would take it away

645
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,959
and I'd never find it again.

646
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,639
Liars!

647
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,119
I brought you a present.

648
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,479
There are geraniums,

649
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,919
camellias, daisies, cactus,

650
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,559
sweet potatoes, everything
but potatoes. Why?

651
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,159
Why are you afraid

652
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,199
to walk alone on the street?

653
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,759
Because...

654
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,279
Me too, because I want to.

655
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,279
I'm not afraid because I want to.

656
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,159
Only death is obligatory,

657
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,399
the rest

658
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,119
is because we want to...

659
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,639
And when they kill you or rape you, what?

660
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,919
That's not obligatory!

661
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,879
Potatoes are cheap

662
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,719
and bloom very little.

663
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,839
All brides stand up, please.

664
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,159
Do you all accept your husbands?

665
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,879
Yes, we do.

666
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,759
Now, all grooms stand up, please.

667
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,919
Do you all accept your brides?

668
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,719
Yes, we do.

669
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,679
Everyone stand up, please.

670
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,319
Grooms,

671
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,279
you may now kiss your brides.

672
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,439
Ladies and gentlemen,

673
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,079
this is the highlight of the celebration.

674
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,359
The families of the grooms

675
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,279
have saved up all year

676
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,479
to give them a great gift.

677
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,159
Let's receive, with a round of applause,

678
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,079
those guinea pigs

679
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,759
so that the couples may eat.

680
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,399
And here come the rest

681
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,319
of the gifts! Let's see!

682
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,519
There is also a beautiful painting
of the Sacred Heart.

683
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,679
What beautiful gifts

684
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,799
for the happiness of the home!

685
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,959
What great gifts!

686
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,999
Wonderful beer

687
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,359
to cheer up the attendants.

688
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,359
This beautiful sofa

689
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,359
for the bride to sit down on

690
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,439
while happily watching their TV.

691
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,919
Welcome to that bed!

692
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,519
The bed of love!

693
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,999
For the enjoyment of the bride and groom.

694
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,959
And there are the chickens,

695
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,039
for them to have eggs at home.

696
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,199
And those great gifts as well.

697
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,799
That beautiful mirror for

698
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,839
the bride to look at herself.

699
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,479
And that ironing board.
This is wonderful!

700
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,519
And the cradle ready for the baby.

701
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,199
And this bird

702
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,559
to cheer their home up.

703
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,039
Thank you, family.

704
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,279
Thanks for so many gifts!

705
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,439
Let's have them kiss once again.

706
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,439
Congratulations and thank you, family!

707
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,599
What a wonderful family, thank you!

708
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,239
Feeling better?
- Yes, Uncle.

709
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,199
Melvin's taking you to the doctor.

710
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,199
How much did your earrings cost?

711
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,159
What?
- How much did your earrings cost?

712
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,279
My grandma gave them to me before dying.

713
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,799
They're pretty.
- I like them too.

714
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,399
And where did you buy your pants?

715
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,679
In the market.

716
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,119
For how much?
- 12 soles.

717
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,239
Did you buy your sandals there?

718
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,959
What?

719
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,519
At the market too?
- No, at a store.

720
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,199
And for how much?
- 23 soles.

721
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,439
They look comfortable.
- They are.

722
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,199
I'd like to buy a pair, but...

723
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,319
Your report number?

724
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,199
Where is your report?

725
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,799
Didn't you get a paper for admittance?

726
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,519
Or a number for your firstvisit?
Have you come before?

727
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,839
Yes, doctor, but I didn't bring...

728
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,239
What have you got so I can find
your case history?

729
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,039
I don't want to be rude,

730
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,439
but we attend over 80 cases a day.

731
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,519
We're tired and short-staffed.
Look at the line.

732
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,559
Go get the report, come back

733
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,959
tomorrow and we won't waste time.

734
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,039
Next.

735
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,159
You are ill as well.

736
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,239
So you won't follow me.

737
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,399
Look here.

738
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,119
Take them.

739
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,399
Thanks a lot, Barbarita, thanks a lot.

740
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,999
Yes, I'm happy, very happy.

741
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,839
Okay, whenever you want.

742
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,119
All my love. Ciao. Ciao.

743
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,079
Won't you say anything?

744
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,879
Congratulations, it was great.

745
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,519
All of Lima was there.

746
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,159
They really liked it, didn't they?

747
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,239
Isidra gets off here. She's walking.

748
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,239
At the corner?
- Yes, drop her off.

749
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,239
What can I do here?

750
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,119
My pearls, my pearls!

751
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,319
We made a deal!

752
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,439
Stop, Mrs. Aida!

753
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,359
I went to volleyball the other day

754
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,079
and I played with Katty.

755
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,799
I tell you,

756
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,479
she hit so hard

757
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,079
she almost broke my wrist.

758
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,559
Speaking about volleyball,

759
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:45,079
I've been invited

760
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,479
to a championship.

761
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,479
Will you go?
- Why, sure.

762
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,559
Grandma, say hello to the camera,

763
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,039
a few words.

764
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,479
You'll all look beautiful!

765
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,759
Marcos, I love you.

766
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,359
You better love me
as much as I love you.

767
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,559
They're going to brush the cat.

768
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,079
He'll look great for the wedding.

769
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,319
Uncle, I tried to take her

770
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,439
to the village but I couldn't.

771
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,479
Forgive me, Uncle. Please.

772
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,999
Mom, my train doesn't fly.

773
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,559
Relax, Máxima. Give me a hand.
It does fly!

774
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,359
How could you put balloons there?

775
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,679
Máxima, please relax.
It should fly like the angels!

776
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,879
Marcos is waiting for you.
Come on.

777
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,479
You're so whimsical.

778
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,959
Come on.

779
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,119
I won't go up until it flies.
- Come on.

780
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,799
No, not till it flies!

781
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,599
Máxima, people are waiting.

782
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,359
Be careful, please.

783
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,799
Slowly, slowly.
Come. Give me your hand.

784
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,079
I don't want to.
- Give me your hand.

785
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,959
I don't want to.
- I'll help you.

786
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,919
Máxima, don't be so whimsical.

787
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,519
Máxima, slowly, slowly.

788
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,199
Ladies and gentlemen,
the first picture. Say cheese!

789
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,919
That's it!

790
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,319
Now for the second picture, friends.

791
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,559
Love is so beautiful! Say cheese!

792
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,479
That's it!

793
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,559
The third picture just like Romeo
and Juliet.

794
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,319
Say cheese. Look at the camera.
That's it!

795
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,159
And now all relatives.

796
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,919
A beautiful family.

797
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,719
Mom, on this side.
- Hurry, cousin!

798
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,559
A family united by the love

799
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:34,399
between Máxima and Marcos!

800
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,039
Hold still a moment,
just a moment.

801
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,719
Just a bit more.

802
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,799
Now look at the camera
and say cheese.

803
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,999
That's it! How nice.
Now we're done.

804
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,199
Now let's get to the banquet,

805
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,399
ladies and gentlemen.

806
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,279
To the banquet!

807
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,999
Today is a very special day.

808
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,159
Love has blessed us.

809
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,639
And now they are also surrounded by

810
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,239
the love of our beloved family.

811
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,919
Thank you for coming.

812
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,679
These were hard times for the family,

813
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,959
but life goes on

814
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,839
and is renewed with new happiness.

815
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,319
Todaywe celebrate life that,

816
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,239
despite everything, always has
beautiful surprises

817
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,919
full of happiness.

818
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,919
We will dance and eat till dawn,

819
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,479
because this banquet today

820
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,759
is going nowhere. It is my gift.

821
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,119
See how you breathe?

822
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,479
See how you want to live?

823
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,159
You want to live but you don't dare.
- Let go!

824
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,479
Breathe!

825
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,759
Fausta, don't leave!

826
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,199
Fausta, don't go! Fausta!

827
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,839
Have it removed. Please.

828
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,439
Get it removed from inside me.

829
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,079
Emergencies, please.
- The 2nd door.

830
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:11,279
Relatives of Meza Ala.

831
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,919
The doctor said you didn't

832
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,199
open your hand during the operation.

833
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,039
Uncle, stop! Uncle, stop!

834
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,559
Uncle!

835
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,479
Look at the sea, Mama.

836
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,079
Look at the sea.

837
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,079
No, not like that!

838
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,519
You have to stomp your feet hard.

839
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:27,959
That's it.

840
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,919
Fausta, someone is calling you!

841
