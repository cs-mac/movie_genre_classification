{1195}{1233}Ahem.
{1260}{1307}STORYTELLER:|Once upon a time...
{1308}{1335}there was|a quiet little village...
{1336}{1382}in the French countryside...
{1383}{1457}whose people believed|in "tranquilité".
{1458}{1499}[Doors bang shut]

{2417}{2463}And through all...
{2464}{2566}STORYTELLER: You knew your|place in the scheme of things.
{2567}{2678}And if you happened to forget,|someone would help remind you.
{2679}{2703}[Snorts]
{2979}{3031}The season of Lent is upon us.
{3032}{3135}This is, of course,|a time of abstinence.
{3136}{3239}Hopefully,|also a time of reflection.
{3240}{3312}Above all,|let this be for us a time...
{3344}{3413}PERE:|a time of sincere penitence.
{3414}{3449}[Dog whimpers]
{3450}{3521}PERE: It is a time|to stand up and be counted.
{3522}{3555}STORYTELLER: In this village...
{3556}{3641}if you saw something|you weren't supposed to see...
{3642}{3686}you learned|to look the other way.
{3686}{3730}PERE:|This is a time for Christ.
{3731}{3800}When you reflect,|he knows what you reflect on.
{3800}{3829}STORYTELLER: If by chance...
{3830}{3904}your hopes|had been disappointed...
{3905}{3995}you learned|never to ask for more.
{3996}{4068}PERE: He knows for what|you must be forgiven.
{4069}{4100}[Wind whistling]
{4101}{4179}So in this Year of Our Lord,|1959, things...

{4311}{4403}the villagers held fast|to their traditions.
{4404}{4449}Until...
{4450}{4471}one winter day...
{4472}{4493}one winter day...
{4494}{4586}a sly wind|blew in from the north.
{4730}{4785}PERE: Where will we find truth?
{4786}{4829}[Wind blowing]
{4830}{4873}Where do we start looking?
{4874}{4921}[Wind whistling]
{4922}{4961}PERE: Where will we find truth?

{6428}{6458}Who the hell are you?
{6459}{6533}Oh, uh...
{6534}{6616}We're here about the patisserie.
{6617}{6675}We'd like to rent it...
{6676}{6718}VIANNE:|and the apartment above.
{6719}{6753}Where are you from?
{6754}{6857}Well, we lived in Andalucia|for a while.
{6858}{6949}Let me see.|Before that, Vienna...
{6950}{7025}and before that...

{7078}{7129}ANOUK:|Pantoufle hated it there.
{7130}{7187}Pantoufle is her kangaroo.

{7234}{7312}Bad leg. War injury, huh?
{7710}{7782}I'll expect you to keep it|in good condition.

{8258}{8297}Don't you think so, Mama?
{8298}{8348}It's a lovely town.
{8390}{8478}Mama, Pantoufle wants to know|how long we can stay.

{8667}{8773}Pantoufle wants to hear|about grandmere and grandpere.

{8830}{8886}ANOUK: You always say that.
{8887}{8949}Tell about|grandmere and grandpere.
{8950}{9010}Not tonight.
{9011}{9085}How about the princess|and the pirates?
{9086}{9125}ANOUK: OK.
{9158}{9197}ANOUK: Prepare to fire!
{9198}{9261}All hands on deck!

{9419}{9481}REYNAUD: Forgive the intrusion.
{9482}{9526}VIANNE: It's a pleasure.
{9590}{9637}ANOUK: Sorry, monsieur.
{9638}{9717}-Pirate attack.|-Of course.
{9718}{9762}What is your name?
{9762}{9806}Anouk. What's yours?
{9807}{9878}I am the Comte de Reynaud|at your service.
{9878}{9917}ANOUK: A real one?
{9918}{9970}Like the Comte de Monte Cristo?
{9971}{10033}Ah-ah!|He was not a real one.
{10034}{10093}VIANNE: To what do we owe|the honor of your visit?
{10094}{10149}Well, as mayor of Lansquenet...
{10150}{10207}I want to welcome you|to the community...
{10208}{10295}and to invite you to worship|with us at mass on Sunday.
{10295}{10381}That's very kind of you,|but actually we don't attend.
{10452}{10517}VIANNE: We're glad to be|so near the church, though.
{10518}{10572}We'll enjoy|singing with the bells.
{10573}{10660}The bells are not intended|as an entertainment, Madame.
{10661}{10706}They are a solemn call|to worship for--

{10781}{10829}Mademoiselle.|I've never been married...
{10830}{10896}but feel free to call me Vianne.
{10953}{11030}I hope you'll stop by when|I open for business next week.
{11031}{11096}Yes.
{11097}{11186}Yes, opening a patisserie|during the holy Lenten fast.
{11187}{11228}I could imagine better timing.
{11229}{11288}Oh, but it's not going|to be a patisserie.
{11289}{11328}Then what do you intend to--
{11329}{11374}It's a surprise.
{11375}{11437}It was sweet of you to drop by.
{11630}{11664}STORYTELLER:|The Comte de Reynaud...
{11665}{11780}was a student of history,|and therefore a patient man.
{11781}{11881}He trusted the wisdom|of generations past.
{11882}{11997}Like his ancestors, he watched|over the little village...
{11998}{12057}and led by his own example--

{13370}{13414}CAROLINE: Why?
{13415}{13465}She seems to have|rented out the patisserie.
{13466}{13524}CAROLINE: Oh.
{13525}{13624}I haven't talked to my mother|in quite a while.
{13625}{13673}I'm sorry.|I did not mean to pry.

{36401}{36443}We just don't know who he is.
{36501}{36539}I was out all night with him.

{38055}{38114}Oh, I'm a bad influence.

{52299}{52354}Your grandfather...
{52355}{52426}George Rocher...
{52427}{52538}was the young apothecary|of the town of Aulus-les-Bains.

{52564}{52588}STORYTELLER:|It was Anouk's favorite story.
{52589}{52666}Always told in the same words.
{52667}{52747}George was honest,|prosperous...
{52748}{52823}and trusted by his customers.
{52824}{52890}But George was not content.
{52891}{52938}He felt there|should be more to life...
{52939}{52993}than dispensing liver oil.
{53039}{53107}In the spring of 1927...
{53108}{53153}the Societe Pharmeceutique...
{53154}{53220}formed an expedition|to Central America...
{53221}{53273}to study|the medicinal properties...
{53274}{53336}of certain natural compounds.
{53383}{53475}George was the expedition's|most eager volunteer.
{53539}{53623}But his adventure|took a turn he did not expect.
{53700}{53797}One night, he was invited|to drink unrefined cacao...
{53798}{53837}with a pinch of chili.
{53838}{53939}The very same drink|the ancient Maya...
{53940}{53999}used in their sacred|ceremonies.
{54049}{54117}The Maya believed|cacao held the power...
{54118}{54178}to unlock hidden yearnings...
{54232}{54298}and reveal destinies.
{54364}{54471}And so it was|that George first saw Chitza.
{54590}{54661}Now, George had been raised|a good Catholic...
{54662}{54750}but in his romance|with Chitza...
{54751}{54804}he was willing|to slightly bend the rules...
{54805}{54854}of Christian courtship.
{54896}{54978}The tribal elders|tried to warn George about her.
{54980}{55039}She was one of the wanderers.
{55040}{55107}Her people moved|with the North Wind...
{55108}{55146}from village to village...
{55147}{55212}dispensing ancient remedies...
{55213}{55271}never settling down.
{55272}{55331}Not a good choice for a bride.
{55359}{55429}George did not|heed their warning...
{55430}{55488}and for a while,|it seemed that he and Chitza...
{55489}{55550}might lead a happy life|together in France.
{55551}{55616}[Wind blowing]

{60294}{60354}She suggested|I buy chocolate seashells...
{60355}{60415}for the widow Audel.
{60417}{60483}And, well...

{60557}{60650}At her age? At your age?
{60651}{60742}Yes. And yes.
{60743}{60852}And just what were you doing|in a chocolaterie during Lent?
{60853}{60926}It was for Charly.
{60927}{61002}Again you flout God's law.
{61057}{61168}Well, but if Charly|has no soul...

{93918}{93953}VIANNE: An old remedy.
{93982}{94014}From the cocoa tree.
{94015}{94052}GATI: Tastes strange.
{94053}{94102}Mmm. Maybe your daddy|would like a taste.
{94105}{94174}He's not my daddy.|He's my pony.
{94214}{94269}ANOUK: Here. It's a lot|better than those leaves.

{96603}{96654}When are you going to do|something about it?

{96907}{96952}ROUX: What does he eat?
{96953}{97016}ANOUK: Leaves, bugs...
{97016}{97071}and worms, of course.
{97071}{97126}What about chocolate?
{97127}{97182}Kangaroos don't eat chocolate.
{97183}{97228}Has he ever tried it?
{97262}{97355}ANOUK: [Whispering]|Have you ever tried chocolate?

{99143}{99173}PERE: Satan...

{99262}{99337}At times, Satan is|the singer of a lurid song...
{99338}{99390}PERE: you hear on the radio.
{99391}{99506}At times, the author|of a salacious novel.
{99506}{99593}At times, the quiet man|lurking in the schoolyard...
{99594}{99709}asking your children|if he might join their game.
