1
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:17,727
Man: No.

2
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:26,395
Hear any good stories lately?

3
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,469
Let me see if I know any.

4
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:37,150
Oh, I got a good one.

5
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,549
And this one really happened.

6
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:42,978
I swear.

7
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:54,762
It's another example
of the universe saying,

8
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,270
“Just when you thought
you were safe.

9
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,907
just when you thought
you had it all under control—

10
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,675
wrong place, wrong time.”

11
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,059
No.

12
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:33,800
No.  No!

13
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:47,413
Just give me a second
to figure out the ending.

14
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:58,491
<i>URBANIA</i>

15
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,238
Don't you start with me.

16
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:06,807
Shit.

17
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,741
No, I won't sink to that level.

18
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:13,341
Pussies hold,
you got 60 seconds.

19
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:28,995
Woman: Yum.

20
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:29,996
My favorite—

21
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:31,964
mystery meat.

22
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:34,968
Yeah, isn't it a little—?

23
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,269
Yes, it is.

24
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,305
Hold on.

25
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,006
Atta boy.

26
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,133
Of course, I have
something in position.

27
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:45,269
You're done.

28
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,303
You a broker?

29
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:50,248
Commodities.

30
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:52,910
Got any inside skinny?

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,888
You wanna talk business?

32
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:59,157
Talk down to me.

33
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:01,628
Okay.

34
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:04,164
What have you learned so far?

35
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:06,724
That I can't
control the market.

36
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,532
(knock on door)

37
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,751
Just listen to your body;

38
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,520
it's a disciplined investor.

39
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,022
About your kidney—

40
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,457
taxable fund.

41
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:32,259
One gets over taxed

42
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,693
you got another one
to start all over again.

43
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:37,185
And then there's my favorite—

44
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,895
the emerging markets.

45
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:49,542
Only risk what you're
willing to lose.

46
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,513
Like my daddy said,

47
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:56,182
“You get some battle scars,

48
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:58,673
they make great wars tories.”

49
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,888
(screaming)

50
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:48,535
Woman: They took his kidney,

51
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:50,837
left him cold,
wet and bleeding.

52
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:52,238
Man: Uh-huh.

53
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:54,808
What?  It's true.

54
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,343
I love this city.

55
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:58,811
Someone's always got it
worse than you.

56
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,579
It's true.

57
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:05,251
Man: Did you hear any
good stories lately?

58
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,120
Woman: You hear so many
horror stories

59
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,712
about what's going
on out there.

60
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,614
What is your story?

61
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,124
Hey.

62
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,007
Fuck you.

63
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,599
Hey, that's what I eat.

64
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:33,213
Woman: You know,
I heard this story

65
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:34,547
about this friend
of a friend of mine—

66
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:36,516
Man: I know this one.

67
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:38,018
Remember the 50s?

68
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:40,120
People were fucked
back then doing it

69
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,589
and just as high.
Up the ass, in the mouth—

70
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:43,715
You want some gum?

71
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,056
Why?

72
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:50,726
Take it.

73
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:53,767
We got to get the kids
to the country

74
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,502
where they'll be safe.

75
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,129
I have to go up.

76
00:05:58,204 --> 00:05:59,228
Why?

77
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,711
- This happened.
- Uh-huh.

78
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,579
What if I finally found
that thing I can't get through?

79
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,910
Wouldn't that suck?

80
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:12,118
I'm sorry, this is your story.
Go ahead.

81
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:15,388
Alright, I got a good one,
and this one really happened.

82
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,757
Woman: So the vender
reaches in for a hotdog

83
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,959
and pulls out a boiled rat.

84
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,960
Uh-huh.

85
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,229
So I guess he lost his pet
chihuahua or something

86
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,532
and found him in the cooker.

87
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:26,760
This shit happens
all the time.

88
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:29,602
What?

89
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:33,298
That's my way of keeping
shit from happening to me.

90
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:39,470
Some bull shit story.

91
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:40,702
Shut up.

92
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:42,704
It's true.

93
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:44,984
Something happen to you?

94
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,853
Don't worry,
I got everything under control.

95
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,155
- This happened.
- Uh-huh.

96
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,281
It's true.

97
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,926
You hear so many
horror stories

98
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:54,826
about what's goin' on
out there.

99
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,165
What, it's just
a story, right?

100
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't play games with me.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,002
You think you got it
all figured out.

102
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,594
You don't know
shit about me.

103
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,200
What did you do?

104
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,904
It's weird.
I'm working graveyard now.

105
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:16,416
I can't sleep.

106
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,086
So I'm always going out
when everyone's coming in.

107
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:23,021
And today I felt like

108
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:25,684
I was going back in time

109
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:28,153
to you.

110
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,360
Please pickup.

111
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:38,071
I'm calling like always
before to say that

112
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,732
I'm on my way home.

113
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,171
I really thought
you might be there.

114
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:55,755
Watch out, they're putting
infected needles in there.

115
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,023
One prick and—

116
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:59,759
Oh.  Not exactly the
change I was looking for.

117
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,729
Hey, I got eight inches
and it's all for you.

118
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,397
- Hey.
- Okay,

119
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:06,262
if I get to keep it
when we're done.

120
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,205
Much better than, “Hey.”

121
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,040
Gotta learn
to protect yourself.

122
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,132
Amen.

123
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:18,945
Where are you headed?

124
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:19,934
Oh.

125
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,207
Your life can change
in a second.

126
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,021
I know that.

127
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:30,080
You're never given anything
you can't handle.

128
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,559
Bullshit.

129
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:39,725
It's nice to meet you.

130
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,209
Man: I don't go out
to go in.

131
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,578
That drag queen
is dragging me down!

132
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:54,447
Terry, baby, it's Sam.

133
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:57,050
Terry!

134
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,312
Terry?

135
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:01,588
- Oh.  Hey.
- Sorry.

136
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:03,886
Listen, man, I have
never done this before.

137
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:06,826
I'm just trying
to get home.

138
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,628
I stopped in some
fucking place over there

139
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:09,896
to get a brewsky—
No, really.

140
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:12,265
You know, and I got
to take a leak.

141
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,067
I go in there and
I assume the position.

142
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,568
I got my hands full, right?

143
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:18,799
And some motherfucker
comes in before I even notice.

144
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:28,740
This motherfucker is
making off with my wallet!

145
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,144
Get in the fucking car.

146
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,445
I'm pissing on the wall
and my shoes and—

147
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:38,791
Motherfucker.

148
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,593
Yeah, man,
that's what happened.

149
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:43,796
So, yeah,
I'll tell you what.

150
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:46,599
Why don't—
Here.

151
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,067
Why don't you write
your name and address

152
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,235
on this little
piece of paper

153
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:50,998
and I'll mail you
the ten bucks back?

154
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:52,663
You got a pen?

155
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,233
(police sirens)

156
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:08,171
Hello.

157
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:15,088
Is it you?

158
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:16,783
(phone hangs up)

159
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,495
(phone rings)

160
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,282
TV: Hello?

161
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,642
It's me.

162
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:51,057
I've called the police.

163
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:52,490
They don't care.

164
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:56,496
My boyfriend's
on his way over.

165
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,430
He's never getting there.

166
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:02,268
What do you want from me?

167
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:04,133
I want you to know

168
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,604
you're mine.

169
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,642
Neighbor: No.

170
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:12,236
No!  It hurts!

171
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,006
It hurts.

172
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:17,683
Leave me alone!

173
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:20,620
TV: Belle, Sgt. Prowell,
60th Precinct.

174
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,621
We've traced the calls.

175
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:24,023
They're coming from
inside the house.

176
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,012
Get out!

177
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,980
Police, hold it right there.

178
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,208
Freeze.

179
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:56,681
Man: God damn it.

180
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,830
Can you help me out?
I need—

181
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,001
I want to rep—

182
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:20,880
No, I'm—

183
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,508
You know what?
I'm gonna do this myself.

184
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,085
It hurts.

185
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,437
You standing guard?

186
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:45,836
Got a date?

187
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:48,808
If I get lucky.

188
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:51,444
If you get lucky,
good night for it.

189
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:54,680
Daylight savings time
ends tonight.

190
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,171
You get one hour twice.

191
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:01,287
Yeah.

192
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:05,358
I don't do good in winter
on account I'm so cold-blooded,

193
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:07,193
just like my mother.

194
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:09,762
My mother,
if she saw me like this

195
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:11,397
she would just die.

196
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:13,058
Luckily she's dead.

197
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:15,701
Stay warm.

198
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,168
Yeah.

199
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,505
My mother—

200
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:23,176
Ain't you ever hear the one
about the lady a long time ago

201
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,945
who had this baby
and she was parked in this lot?

202
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:28,214
And she was doing her best,

203
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:30,616
she had her arms full
with the baby and the bags.

204
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:33,152
She put the baby
on the car roof,

205
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:36,255
and she put the bags
in the back, and got in.

206
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:39,458
and she left the baby
on the roof and forgot about it.

207
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,459
You hear that one?

208
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,527
No.

209
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,461
Well, that was my mother.

210
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:49,268
Maybe that's why
I'm a little—

211
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:50,803
you know—in the head.

212
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:52,930
Oh, I don't know.

213
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,500
It's a good story though.

214
00:14:58,144 --> 00:14:59,345
Have you eaten?

215
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:00,646
Oh, God, yeah.

216
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:04,784
I ate a whole bag
of Pepperidge Farm cookies

217
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,720
and some Kellog's lightly
frosted bran flakes,

218
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,423
just an hour ago.
I'm still stuffed.

219
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:11,958
Here you go.
Take it anyway.

220
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,482
I gotta go.

221
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,359
Buy a bottle of something.

222
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:20,621
Hey, I'm on the wagon.
Fuck.

223
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,761
Don't forget to set
your clock back!

224
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,581
Uh, watch it, dick!

225
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:30,231
<KARMA>

226
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,952
How are you doing
this evening?

227
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:50,356
Something I can get you?

228
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:54,427
I'm forgetting about you
at least twice a day.

229
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:57,229
Hey, come on!

230
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:00,466
Why would I hate you?
I hardly know you!

231
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:01,558
Here you go.

232
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,396
Looking for someone?

233
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:07,740
I'm going to wait.

234
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,075
Please.

235
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:11,610
In the mean time,
can I get you something?

236
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,611
I don't drink anymore.

237
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:15,348
Seltzer?
Bottle of spring water?

238
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:16,582
Anything?

239
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:18,607
- No, thanks.
- Juice?

240
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:21,620
What's your name?

241
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,922
My name?
Matt.

242
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:25,686
Matt, nothing, thanks.

243
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:32,789
Yum, thanks.

244
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:36,768
- Hey, Molly.
- Matt.

245
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:46,778
Here.
For taking up space.

246
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,685
You're waiting?

247
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,286
Yeah.

248
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:55,685
For this—um—

249
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,858
this guy.

250
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:00,526
Something happened and—

251
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:01,493
(glass shatters)

252
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:06,198
You don't
wanna hear this.

253
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,299
It's alright.

254
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,235
No, this isn't
that kind of bar

255
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:12,471
and from the looks of things
you're not that kind of bartender.

256
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,166
That kind?

257
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,614
Oh.

258
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:22,782
Probably not.

259
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:24,083
Probably?

260
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,641
Uh, not.

261
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:33,325
Listen, I hold no objections
to human needs.

262
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,827
Oh yeah?

263
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,195
We've all been there—

264
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:38,164
the heart racing,
pulse beating—

265
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:40,332
penis throbbing—

266
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,629
Oh.

267
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,004
Hey, look, you know,
I don't know you,

268
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:47,006
you don't know me.
You don't know what my story is.

269
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:49,031
Too true.
What is your story?

270
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:51,677
No.

271
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:53,145
Distract me, Matt.

272
00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:55,010
Take me out of my own head
for two minutes.

273
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:01,954
Her name was Clara.

274
00:19:01,954 --> 00:19:04,857
Early 40s, beautiful.

275
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:07,951
Lover of jazz
and Bourbon Sours.

276
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:18,359
Woman: These are what
Catherine Deneuve drinks.

277
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,942
Bourbon Sours.

278
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:24,933
Read that in an interview.

279
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:32,418
I was beautiful once.

280
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,954
What are you talking about?

281
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:36,422
You're still
a beautiful woman.

282
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:39,758
If ol' Catherine were married
to the thing that I'm married to,

283
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:42,862
and had given birth
to these American monsters,

284
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,797
she wouldn't look
too good either.

285
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:46,899
She goes on like this.

286
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:48,534
Those miserable kids—

287
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:50,803
they cruise the web
for porno sites.

288
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:53,072
And now
these American kids

289
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:55,708
can't be a second
without entertainment.

290
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,834
Always.

291
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:06,619
They have their remote mentality
in their head, you know?

292
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,420
Always looking
for something better.

293
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,390
Like their father, always
looking for something new.

294
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,019
And if you're not attending to
them, they click you off.

295
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,392
My husband is
fucking around on me,

296
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:29,608
I'm a redundancy
with no cash value.

297
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:30,776
Don't say that.

298
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,209
Shut up, it's true.

299
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,350
And then she stares at me,

300
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,952
and I mean, stares.

301
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:42,250
I get an immediate bone,
I must admit.

302
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:47,185
And then she puts a crisp 50
down on the bar.

303
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:50,896
For you.

304
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:52,932
Why? I haven't done anything
to deserve that.

305
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,422
Not yet.

306
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:58,470
What's your name?

307
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,960
My name, um, Matt.

308
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:02,663
Matt.

309
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:05,505
Show me.

310
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,681
- Matt.
- I'm sorry, show you?

311
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,809
Join me a minute in the bathroom
and show me what you have.

312
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:15,676
No.

313
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,389
I'm sorry, no.

314
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:38,338
Clearly a woman for whom
“no” was for the right price—

315
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:40,369
“Yes.”

316
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:46,285
No woman ever wanted
to just use me.

317
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:48,048
I appreciated that.

318
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:50,422
So?

319
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:54,293
Well, it was getting to be
a ridiculous amount of money

320
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:55,920
for one simple flash.

321
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:12,500
That's all she wanted
after all.

322
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:36,568
I went home and pulled
the pud goodnight.

323
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:37,870
Jesus.

324
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,774
Anyway, about three months later
I get a certified letter.

325
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:43,909
I never got
one of those before.

326
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:47,046
Saying Clara and that husband
of hers had gone on a vacation.

327
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:49,048
She got one of those
airline insurance policies

328
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,243
and named me
as the beneficiary.

329
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:55,888
Their plane blew up.

330
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,756
That stool
you're sitting on,

331
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:58,745
is mine.

332
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:04,296
So believe me,
I hold no objection

333
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:05,497
to human needs.

334
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:08,100
Wow.

335
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,795
Wow, now I want to see.

336
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,337
Bye, Matt.

337
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:14,100
Hey, thanks, guys.
Goodnight.

338
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:24,110
Human needs, man.

339
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:28,587
Yeah, look—

340
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:29,918
No objections, right?

341
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:37,796
It's for your help.

342
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:39,131
Dick.

343
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:40,632
This guy, he's—

344
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:43,235
someone you might
remember seeing in here.

345
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:44,930
What does he look like?

346
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:48,807
Well,

347
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,776
he was born with
all the right stuff.

348
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:52,344
Good looking, huh?

349
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:56,014
Yeah, but he's fast approaching
the flipside of sexy.

350
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:57,916
He doesn't
take care of himself.

351
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,419
He's reckless,
for now, though.

352
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,353
Gotcha.

353
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,322
He's got a tattoo.

354
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,190
A big one.

355
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,092
- A snake—
- Wrapped around a heart?

356
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:08,081
Squeezing.

357
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:10,725
That's the guy?

358
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:15,232
Don't worry,
I know about the girl.

359
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:19,471
Is he hanging
with any guys lately?

360
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:21,573
No.

361
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:23,342
Any particular days?
Times?

362
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:24,866
No.  Late.

363
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:27,602
Okay.

364
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:30,978
I'll see you later then,
alright?

365
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:34,686
You sure he's what
you're looking for?

366
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:36,244
Yeah.

367
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,519
Don't worry,
I got everything under control.

368
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:42,795
Hey, what do you
want to do?

369
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:45,130
Do you want to do what,
honeybun?

370
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,495
Come on, little girl.

371
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:30,776
Hey, it's Charlie—

372
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:32,177
Oh my God!

373
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,508
I was in the neighbor—

374
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,750
Please, oh my God,
she'll catch her death!

375
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,446
It rained on her.

376
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:07,179
My my my,
look what the cat—

377
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:08,339
yadda-yadda-yadda.

378
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:19,720
- I thought I'd say—
- Hey.

379
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:21,994
Oh, you're wet.

380
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:24,189
Oh, I'm sorry.

381
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:27,392
Come in from the rain.

382
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:33,396
At last.  Hey!

383
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:56,853
Great.

384
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,164
Yeah.

385
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:12,611
« He wanted big beehive hair »

386
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:16,604
« Big beehive hair »

387
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:38,928
Hey, hey, darling!

388
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:58,357
Let's get you
out of these things.

389
00:27:58,357 --> 00:27:59,624
Don't worry about me.

390
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:02,461
Oh, but I do.
I lie awake at night thinking,

391
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,520
“What's become of him?
Is he wet?”

392
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:08,867
What?

393
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,061
Brett, are you
expecting company?

394
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,767
Oh, God!
Yuck!

395
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:18,400
Hey, Charlie, you just
thumbed out a family member.

396
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,315
It's yours.

397
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:24,816
You preserving it?

398
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:27,285
Eat me.

399
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:28,616
Please.

400
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:33,158
Elderly woman: No, we don't
want—  Oh, dear.

401
00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:36,428
Oh my, Vivian.
Poor little Vivian.

402
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:39,831
We got to get you dry.

403
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:43,035
We don't want the little girl
to catch pneumonia.

404
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:46,138
We've got to get you dry.
Oh dear—!

405
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,373
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
I just heard a sneeze.

406
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:50,175
Oh my baby had a sneeze.

407
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:51,877
You'll catch your death.

408
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:54,913
Oh, we're going
to make you dry.

409
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:55,814
Did this warm you up?

410
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,873
- Sure.
- Look.

411
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:02,217
Oh, God.

412
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:09,492
So, what have
you been up to?

413
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,598
What have you
been up to?

414
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:16,533
Oh, I missed you,
Charlie.

415
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:20,172
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

416
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:21,434
I am.

417
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:26,178
That's just the old girl
next door's microwave.

418
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:28,413
(dog yowling)

419
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:30,847
- Vivian!
- She's nuts.

420
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:34,586
So—

421
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:36,076
So.

422
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:39,756
Are we all talked out?

423
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,984
I'll tell you what
I've been doing.

424
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:49,030
I have been having
an intimate relationship

425
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:51,863
with my VCR.

426
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:56,842
Renting all this groovy,
early 70's British stuff.

427
00:29:56,842 --> 00:29:58,009
And for some reason

428
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:00,512
Glenda Jackson is in
every single one of them.

429
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:01,913
You know who she is?

430
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:03,849
Of course you don't.
You're movie illiterate.

431
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:06,151
Yes, I know who
Glenda fucking Jackson is.

432
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:08,016
Charlie's getting a boner.

433
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:15,861
Anyway, last night
was “Sunday Bloody Sunday.”

434
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:17,929
Did you ever see it?

435
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,332
Glenda and Peter Finch
are both in love

436
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:21,900
with Murray Head.

437
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,302
And they both make do
while he flits back and forth.

438
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:26,471
It is, after all, the 70s.

439
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:28,773
And Murray, being the butt-plug
that he is,

440
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:31,537
doesn't see the problem,
until one day Glenda says,

441
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:37,137
“I've had this business,
"Anything is better than nothing."

442
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,318
There are some times
when nothing

443
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,786
has to be better
than anything.”

444
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:50,327
How are you doing?

445
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:56,132
He said, “Biting the bullet.”

446
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,333
How Stella Dallas of you.

447
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:01,806
Do you know who
Stella Dallas is?

448
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:03,808
Fuck you.

449
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:05,210
You don't, do you?

450
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,768
You're so butch.

451
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:10,482
Brett, not all of us
are into drawing tea roses

452
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:12,150
and collecting
Depression glass.

453
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,052
That I left
to you and Chris.

454
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:17,419
Oh, the portion of our program
where we discuss him.

455
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,685
Oh, that look.

456
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:25,221
Look.

457
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:36,030
Cold.

458
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:52,857
Up.

459
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:54,256
Alright.

460
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:01,166
Now you're protected.

461
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,101
Listen,

462
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:05,036
I'm here for you.

463
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:06,605
Of course you are,
you're not here for you.

464
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:08,907
This is strictly
a penance visit.

465
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:10,397
Who'd you kill, Charlie?

466
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:26,313
Well, I am scoring
high tonight.

467
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:34,426
Still in mourning, huh?

468
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:39,771
Still seeing—
what's her name, Renee?

469
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:41,673
I'm not going
to a therapist

470
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:43,675
who survived Auschwitz.
Okay?

471
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:46,544
I felt so guilty
talking about my problems.

472
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:49,138
Forget me,
what you've been through—

473
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:55,186
Besides, I think I found him.

474
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:56,881
Who?

475
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:06,823
The guy who's going to make
everything right.

476
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,367
So you see,
I am recovering.

477
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:12,070
Great, where'd you meet him?

478
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,006
If I tell you that, you'll think
I'm this cheap thing.

479
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:16,508
No, I won't, I swear.

480
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:18,209
In the street.

481
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:19,944
You whore!

482
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:21,844
Right out in the open
like that.

483
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:31,583
- What's his name?
- I didn't ask.

484
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,825
Oh my God.

485
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:36,928
Yeah, we had this one
fateful encounter.

486
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:38,063
You're the worst.

487
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:39,496
Yeah, I wish.

488
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:46,603
Last week I saw him
coming out of this bar.

489
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:48,406
And?

490
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,608
- I didn't have the guts.
- Poor Charlie.

491
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:53,475
No, not anymore.

492
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,639
Not this time.

493
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:58,917
I just went back.

494
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,719
And?

495
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:03,788
He wasn't in...
yet.

496
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:05,949
So, I—

497
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:08,457
came here...

498
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:14,058
in the interim.

499
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:18,636
No, I wanted to see you.

500
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:21,172
Thanks.

501
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:22,537
Thanks.

502
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:24,934
So—

503
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:32,542
I think down deep you would be
glad if you saw him.

504
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:34,853
Good luck, honey.

505
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,912
I only wish
the best for you.

506
00:34:38,256 --> 00:34:39,689
Okay, what's wrong?

507
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,589
I hate this.

508
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:47,458
I know you do.

509
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:51,459
No.

510
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:56,841
You see, I'm blind
in my right eye now.

511
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:58,365
So boring.

512
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:02,247
You know what
really makes me pissy?

513
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:05,648
Grunge, heroin chic,
and dying are over.

514
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:09,176
I so hate being
behind the curve.

515
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:13,121
Tourism's up.

516
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:18,157
Are you okay?

517
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:21,766
Why don't you,

518
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:25,470
I don't know,
write a column for the magazine?

519
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,272
“The View from My Window,”

520
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:29,536
“Vintage Videos,”
I don't know.

521
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:33,344
- I'll let you go now.
- No, no.

522
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,779
I'll stay for a little while.

523
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:40,948
Let's watch
“Women In Love.”

524
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:44,145
No.

525
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:51,728
I'm going to lie here and tell
myself stories about you

526
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:55,997
and the cold night,
looking for your man.

527
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:01,573
Don't worry.

528
00:36:01,573 --> 00:36:04,201
In my version you'll always
come out on top.

529
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:11,182
Hearing your voice
on the message

530
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:13,384
doesn't cut it anymore.

531
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:15,375
I need you to talk to me.

532
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:21,159
I finally figured out

533
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,994
what I need to do.

534
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:24,762
Please pickup.

535
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:26,923
Look, I'm going to be
a second, okay?

536
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:31,436
You have to be able
to talk to me.

537
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:32,460
Just—  What?!

538
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:39,134
I gotta call you back.

539
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,781
Yeah, somebody here
needs an ambulance.

540
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,889
I'm sorry.

541
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:08,734
Oh God.

542
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:15,044
That's $5.

543
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:18,049
Hey, Charlie.

544
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,018
Matt.

545
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:21,920
No sign yet.

546
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,054
Thanks.

547
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:25,189
Be patient, my friend.

548
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:26,491
That's my middle name.

549
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:29,394
God rewards the patient.

550
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:32,997
I thought he rewarded the meek,
or something.

551
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,232
Both.

552
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:35,426
That's good.

553
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:39,137
It will be my night
after all then.

554
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:41,071
See ya.

555
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:52,984
No, I've got my heart set.

556
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:55,386
Are you kidding me?
Did you see that guy?

557
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:58,514
I don't know if I could
kick him out of my ass.

558
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:02,355
Oh, he's not.

559
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:04,896
Go, get out of here.

560
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:06,887
If your guy comes,
he'll stay awhile.

561
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:26,084
The blindfold,

562
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:29,020
for, you know,
before you get on the plane.

563
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,522
I start to think he's trying
to sell me into white slavery,

564
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,992
but no, St. Bart's!

565
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:36,594
I'm think Barry has gotten well.

566
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:39,097
First day on the beach,
fabulous.

567
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:42,667
Aw, see?

568
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,603
But then, you know,
we go back to the room,

569
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:48,406
and the room
when we had been out,

570
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:50,875
had been
completely ransacked.

571
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:54,445
Somebody, you know,
like, the help—the natives—

572
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:55,680
oh, I'm sorry—

573
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,450
but somebody had gone through
and stolen everything.

574
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,587
My clothes, everything.

575
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:05,613
But the camera, thank God.

576
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:08,393
And, you know,
all the bathroom junk

577
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:11,629
like the contact lens stuff,
the toothbrush—is still there.

578
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:14,732
Okay, so Gary asks me,
“What do we do?”

579
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:16,501
Well, I will not be moved.

580
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:19,904
I will not start the rest
of my life with this violation.

581
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:22,140
Shit happens, the saying goes.

582
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,441
So,

583
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:27,002
Barry and I just took
the best damn pictures we could.

584
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,069
Look at this one.

585
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:34,645
I'll be getting lots
of multiples of these.

586
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,853
Night.

587
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:40,354
- How much is that?
- $40.

588
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:44,529
- Thank you.
- Oh my God!

589
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:47,732
Oh my God.

590
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:50,201
Oh my God.

591
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:52,294
- Here you go.
- Leave it!

592
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:59,669
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

593
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:08,778
Wow.

594
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:12,818
I guess
shit really does happen.

595
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:18,886
I'm—

596
00:40:58,569 --> 00:40:59,831
Third time's a charm.

597
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,966
Second floor.

598
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:10,876
(door buzzes)

599
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:29,288
Hello?

600
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:33,437
Television:
But now everything's changed.

601
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:35,606
- I don't know you anymore.
- Hello?

602
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:38,342
The accident's turned you
into something else,

603
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:39,900
someone I don't know.

604
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:50,409
These arms were made
to hold you.

605
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:54,025
No, stop.

606
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:55,993
Tomorrow.

607
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:58,428
It's from my reel.

608
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,757
I want to make sure
it taped okay.

609
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:05,469
Soaps suck.

610
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:07,437
My agent's trying
to get me of fit.

611
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:13,467
You don't give a shit.

612
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:17,344
That's cool.

613
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,080
What can I do
to impress you?

614
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:29,719
I'm fine.

615
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:41,372
You like acting?

616
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:43,975
Oh, yeah.
You get to be other people—

617
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:46,077
if you're good.

618
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:50,114
You get to scream and shout,
let the demons out.

619
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:51,649
You get noticed,

620
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:53,879
which makes having demons
almost worth while.

621
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:06,295
I love that I go over,
you go under.

622
00:43:07,398 --> 00:43:09,533
Didn't we just do that?

623
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:10,801
Move.

624
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:14,138
You're on my side.

625
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:17,005
Let's find out
how the other half sleeps.

626
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:22,179
Scared of waking up
on the wrong side of the bed?

627
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:23,881
You think you're so brave.

628
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:26,250
No, I don't.

629
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,054
I just hoped that if I sleep
in your space

630
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:33,217
you'll be in my dreams.

631
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:41,690
Want one?

632
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:45,269
- Thanks, no.
- It'll make you happy.

633
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:46,861
I don't look happy?

634
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:50,241
You seem, uh—

635
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:52,209
you seem a little tense,

636
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:56,744
mystery man.

637
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:05,688
How'd you get that?

638
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:08,687
Bar brawl.

639
00:44:11,162 --> 00:44:13,130
I love scars on a guy.

640
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:17,034
They make them
look dangerous.

641
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:19,036
That's why
I picked you up tonight.

642
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:21,639
So you think I'm dangerous?

643
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:24,267
I might as well take my
chances and find out.

644
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:31,215
Something about
those eyes...

645
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:32,204
and that.

646
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:47,488
So you like dangerous guys?

647
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:51,298
I don't know.

648
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:55,838
It livens things up.

649
00:44:57,575 --> 00:44:59,202
I get bored easily.

650
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,579
For awhile,
I went to sex clubs.

651
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:06,550
I didn't let anyone
touch me,

652
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,609
I'm not some sort of freak,
but uh—

653
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:13,391
I went to just walk around,

654
00:45:13,391 --> 00:45:16,193
watch people do shit,
get noticed,

655
00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:18,024
get asked to do things.

656
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,633
You wouldn't believe the kind
of shit people are into.

657
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:26,592
I mean, the things that
they wanted me to do to them,

658
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:29,128
but that got boring, too.

659
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:38,783
Yeah, I'm not really into
the whole queer scene.

660
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:42,947
I don't even know any guys
who are, like, totally gay.

661
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:46,657
Excuse me?

662
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:48,522
Well, my friends.

663
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:52,863
My guy friends are straight.

664
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:55,332
I consider myself bisexual.

665
00:45:55,332 --> 00:45:57,766
There was this gal
at school.

666
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,273
She was short, she was pretty.

667
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:05,640
She was a hell of an actress
and we were engaged for awhile.

668
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:12,776
I really like girls, but—

669
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,483
Well?

670
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:23,227
You can't help yourself, right?

671
00:46:23,227 --> 00:46:26,297
Your libidinous nature just
demands that you fuck everything.

672
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:27,832
Yeah.

673
00:46:27,832 --> 00:46:29,493
Hey, listen, uh—

674
00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:32,794
- Charlie.
- Charlie—

675
00:46:34,004 --> 00:46:37,303
Charlie,
if I didn't like you

676
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:41,577
in my place.

677
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,220
Oh, in your place.

678
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,788
I'm breathing
the very same air.

679
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:52,551
What more
could a girl wish?

680
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:56,320
I guess whatever happens
after this will be gravy, right?

681
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,101
Come on, let's fuck.

682
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:10,564
It's cold.

683
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:46,936
Okay, okay.

684
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:52,340
Look, I don't
get fucked, okay?

685
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,384
It's just—

686
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:58,616
I don't allow it.

687
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:01,959
Really?

688
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:05,417
Shit, because that's all I do.
I fuck.

689
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,419
What's so funny?

690
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:15,706
You're a weird guy, Charlie.

691
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:18,609
Why do you say that?

692
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:19,944
Ron.

693
00:48:19,944 --> 00:48:23,514
Ron.  I'm serious, Ron.

694
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:25,282
That's why you brought me here,
isn't it?

695
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:27,147
Alright!  Okay, okay.
Alright.

696
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:34,083
Maybe this was
a mistake, okay?

697
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:38,159
This isn't going
to workout.

698
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:40,523
So—

699
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:45,369
- Yeah, what?
- Maybe you should just leave.

700
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:47,671
Maybe you should
just make me, okay?

701
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:49,106
- What?
- You're the man, right?

702
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:50,274
You like danger.

703
00:48:50,274 --> 00:48:52,109
- Just go.
- I'm dismissed.

704
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:54,812
- I didn't pass muster.
- This is my place.

705
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:56,177
You can say that all night.

706
00:48:57,548 --> 00:48:58,782
Look, I mean it.
Get out of here.

707
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:00,443
You get the fuck out of here.

708
00:49:04,855 --> 00:49:06,447
I mean it.
Let's go.

709
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:09,389
So do I.

710
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:19,559
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

711
00:49:20,871 --> 00:49:23,240
You bring a guy here,
up to your place,

712
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,442
with presumably every
intention on your part

713
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:27,244
and his, to fuck,

714
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:29,235
somebody you don't even know,
and here he is.

715
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:31,949
Maybe he takes offense
at some thing you said.

716
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:34,577
Maybe he takes offense
at any number of things.

717
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:38,389
And sure, you can claim
territorial imperative.

718
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:39,549
It is your place.

719
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:42,624
Maybe he just doesn't
give a shit.

720
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:46,830
What the fuck are you
going to do?

721
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,833
You going to come over
here and call the cops?

722
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:50,959
See if you get that far.

723
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:54,462
You want me to fuck you?

724
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,941
Huh, cunt?

725
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:59,343
You want me to?

726
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:02,079
I'll give you a scar
you really don't want, asshole.

727
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,171
Faggot!

728
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:47,752
Chuck.

729
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:52,957
I did not.

730
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,037
Fuck!

731
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:26,988
Woman:
No, I made a couple of hints—

732
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:39,076
Honey, I think
we've got company.

733
00:51:39,076 --> 00:51:41,678
I hope I'm not interrupting.

734
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:44,114
- Chuck, right?
- Yeah?

735
00:51:44,114 --> 00:51:46,049
How are you doing?

736
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:47,751
Not bad.

737
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:49,586
That's good.

738
00:51:49,586 --> 00:51:51,555
You don't remember me,
do you?

739
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:53,690
Yeah, no—
I'm trying to place the—

740
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,794
Chuck's real bad with names
and faces and everything.

741
00:51:56,794 --> 00:51:59,263
- That's too bad.
- But he's so cute and charming,

742
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:01,331
so we gotta forgive him.

743
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:04,034
Woman: Chuck, table for two.

744
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:05,695
Oh, I'll walk you.

745
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:09,039
- I'm Deedee.
- I'm Charlie.

746
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:11,667
- Nice to meet you, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you, Deedee.

747
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:16,213
Oh no, no no, I got it.

748
00:52:16,213 --> 00:52:18,382
You played baseball against
us in the park, right?

749
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:20,984
Grey, right?
Right?

750
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:22,719
Honey, Grey Advertising.

751
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:24,388
At the park?

752
00:52:24,388 --> 00:52:27,090
Baseball Saturday,
isn't it the best?

753
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:31,495
You and me and Don and Bob
and all us guys.

754
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:33,564
scratching our nuts
inside our jocks,

755
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:37,034
swinging our hunks of wood,
reaching into the Igloo cooler

756
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:39,570
and downing some Coors,
getting buzzed.

757
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,239
Oh, and then some babes
walk by

758
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:44,173
and we say things
to get their attention.

759
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:48,041
God, it's great!

760
00:52:49,446 --> 00:52:51,915
No.  No, I'll tell you
how we me teach other.

761
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:53,050
We met on the stairs.

762
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,285
You just came back
from that bicycle race.

763
00:52:55,285 --> 00:52:56,286
Oh, okay.

764
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:58,222
And you were wearing
those shorts, you know—

765
00:52:58,222 --> 00:53:02,259
skintight, Nike, with a pink
slash running up the side?

766
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:04,461
Deedee, you ever see Chuck
in those shorts?

767
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:06,190
Oh dear.

768
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:09,600
You live in the apartment
above mine.

769
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,966
Yeah, right,
I thought you looked familiar.

770
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,311
Let me buy you both
some drinks.

771
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:22,346
- No, that's alright.
- Sure!

772
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:24,014
Don't we have to go
to the show?

773
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:25,249
Oh, no, we got time, honey.

774
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:27,150
Great.
Another round, please.

775
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,719
- Same thing?
- Sure.

776
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:30,983
And some calamari.

777
00:53:32,723 --> 00:53:35,092
Oh God, you guys look
so great together.

778
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:36,860
Well, we deserve each other.

779
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,596
I mean, good things happen
to people that deserve them.

780
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:42,065
I am sure it's just a matter
of time for you, Charlie,

781
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:44,601
- you know what I mean?
- No, what do you mean?

782
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:47,037
You know what I mean,
the right girl.

783
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:48,505
You're going to find her.

784
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:52,376
It just might mean having to work
a little bit to find her.

785
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:54,745
There is this book
I've been reading.

786
00:53:54,745 --> 00:53:56,280
- Please.
- It's about—  What?

787
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,948
No, I wanna hear it.

788
00:53:57,948 --> 00:53:59,249
He wants to hear it.

789
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:03,086
So in this book this guy,
he says, quote,

790
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,522
“There are two ways
to approach life:

791
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:07,591
as victim,
or as gallant fighter.

792
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:10,827
You must decide if
you're gonna act or react.

793
00:54:10,827 --> 00:54:13,564
Deal your own cards
or play with a stacked deck.

794
00:54:13,564 --> 00:54:16,133
Because if you don't decide
which way to play,

795
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:18,124
life always plays with you.”

796
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:23,140
I mean, it's simple,
but it's—

797
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,875
Dopey, honey.
It's a little dopey.

798
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:27,878
- Dopey?
- No, I think it's—

799
00:54:27,878 --> 00:54:30,814
well, yeah, it sounds dopey,
stupid, whatever.

800
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:33,317
But look, deep down
there is truth.

801
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:34,685
Yeah!

802
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:37,788
Like I had to work
to get you.

803
00:54:37,788 --> 00:54:40,157
We were set up at this party
a couple of weeks ago,

804
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:42,492
and we really didn't
hit it off at first.

805
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:44,261
I thought he was
just adorable,

806
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:46,957
but a little too, “Hey.”

807
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:50,267
I thought
she talked too much.

808
00:54:50,267 --> 00:54:53,470
But the point is
I wanted him,

809
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,039
and I pushed until
I got him.

810
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:57,563
And here we are.

811
00:54:58,575 --> 00:55:00,010
Honey—

812
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,646
You are so shy!

813
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:04,136
I just love him.

814
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:07,184
We are very fortunate.

815
00:55:07,184 --> 00:55:09,744
You hear so many horror stories
about what's going on out there.

816
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:14,658
I heard this story about
this friend of a friend of mine.

817
00:55:14,658 --> 00:55:16,326
He met this girl
once in a bar

818
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:17,928
kind of like this one,
like a hang out—

819
00:55:17,928 --> 00:55:19,896
- I know this one.
- No.

820
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:21,498
Yeah, she steals
his kidney, right?

821
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:22,590
No, geeze.

822
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:25,390
Okay, so—

823
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:36,267
« Happy anniversary »

824
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:40,817
So anyway, they're talking
and drinking

825
00:55:40,817 --> 00:55:43,754
and things were getting
kind of serious.

826
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:45,522
And they're drinking
more and more

827
00:55:45,522 --> 00:55:47,491
and things were getting
more and more serious

828
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:50,153
until they decide to
go off somewhere.

829
00:55:51,662 --> 00:55:52,929
So, they go back
to his place

830
00:55:52,929 --> 00:55:55,261
and they do it.

831
00:55:57,367 --> 00:56:01,038
Except he isn't wearing
anything on his—

832
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:04,341
I mean, I guess because it's,
he figures she really pretty

833
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:06,209
and she knows all the same
people he knows,

834
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:08,278
they're in the same tax bracket,
I don't know.

835
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:11,714
Anyway, he doesn't wear
anything on his dick.

836
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:14,910
So they spend
the night together.

837
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:22,059
And the next day he wakes up
to find she is gone.

838
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:23,760
He doesn't know who she is,

839
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,462
where she lives,
where she works.

840
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:28,165
The only thing
that she's left behind

841
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:30,167
Is this message
on the mirror,

842
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:31,768
“Welcome to the world of...

843
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:33,503
AIDS

844
00:56:33,503 --> 00:56:35,605
...in lipstick.”

845
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:37,607
Pretty creepy, huh?

846
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:40,277
Not a pleasant story,
not at all.

847
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:42,279
What is so funny you guys?
It's sick!

848
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:43,268
Honey, no—

849
00:56:49,486 --> 00:56:51,716
What do you think
is so funny?

850
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:12,943
Oh, it's the worst.

851
00:57:12,943 --> 00:57:14,578
Damn straight.

852
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:17,647
Alright, some flyboy
fucks a chimpanzee in Zimbabwe

853
00:57:17,647 --> 00:57:20,083
and we're supposed to wear
super elastic bubble plastic

854
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,718
for the rest of our lives.

855
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:23,220
Honey.

856
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,722
- This really happened, Dee?
- Yeah, that's the best part.

857
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:28,358
I mean, it's terrible, but—

858
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:30,360
- They're friends of friends?
- Yeah, why?

859
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,630
Because I heard the same story
like five years ago in Seattle.

860
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,699
It happened to the girl,
not the guy.

861
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:38,368
Why are you being so negative?
Because it's not your story?

862
00:57:38,368 --> 00:57:39,669
This isn't about me.

863
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:41,805
We were supposed to be out
celebrating tonight.

864
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:43,774
You know, a different attitude,
a new leaf.

865
00:57:43,774 --> 00:57:45,408
I just want you to think.

866
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:48,979
I think.
I think you better shut up.

867
00:57:48,979 --> 00:57:51,038
I'm sorry.

868
00:58:00,724 --> 00:58:01,892
So, Chuck,

869
00:58:01,892 --> 00:58:03,985
you don't think
shit like that happens?

870
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:10,157
Well, yeah, but sure not
to anybody I know.

871
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:12,836
Why not?

872
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:14,771
Because—come on.

873
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:16,506
Right.  Right.

874
00:58:16,506 --> 00:58:18,975
Shit like that happens
but not to people like you.

875
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:20,143
No.

876
00:58:20,143 --> 00:58:22,509
Come on, that's people
who want to be people like you.

877
00:58:23,513 --> 00:58:26,116
Life doesn't
just play with you, right?

878
00:58:26,116 --> 00:58:29,152
People don't just use you.
They don't just take advantage—

879
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:31,121
A guy like you?

880
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:32,289
Damn straight.

881
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:36,126
But you know what?
I have to confess.

882
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:37,727
I know a story,

883
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:40,497
and this one really happened.

884
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:44,901
See, this person,
he suffered a tragedy recently.

885
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:46,391
His boyfriend—

886
00:58:47,604 --> 00:58:51,007
well, he was no more,
so to speak.

887
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,144
And this person was feeling
mighty depressed about it,

888
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:56,279
so he was just
lying in bed,

889
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:58,281
sleepless as usual.

890
00:58:58,281 --> 00:59:00,217
When all of a sudden
he could hear this couple

891
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:03,520
through the ceiling
just going at it.

892
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,290
You know, cursing
and yelping and moaning.

893
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,060
And he just kept listening.

894
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,330
Eventually, he stopped thinking
about his own misery

895
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,999
and just concentrated
on the sound of them fucking.

896
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:17,489
So his hand reached down,

897
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:22,138
and he just thinks about
the guy upstairs,

898
00:59:22,138 --> 00:59:24,140
the guy in
his bicycle shorts.

899
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,076
And the next thing
he knows,

900
00:59:26,076 --> 00:59:28,806
all three of them
are finding God simultaneously.

901
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,848
- What the fuck?
- Ever since then,

902
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:35,085
he's been looking
for the chance to say thank you.

903
00:59:35,085 --> 00:59:37,087
Thank you for
a memorable evening,

904
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,577
even if you were only there
in spirit.

905
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:41,124
- Chuck.
- What?  What's the matter?

906
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:43,760
- I fucking knew it!
- It's just a story, right?

907
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,861
Let's get out of here!

908
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:46,863
No, hey, Chuck,
this is on me.

909
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:48,131
Hey, where do you get off?

910
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:49,432
Well...

911
00:59:49,432 --> 00:59:51,368
I ought to knock you
on your ass.

912
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:53,495
- Okay, go ahead.
- He's not worth it.

913
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:56,873
- What is your problem?
- My problem?

914
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:59,542
For one, I'm sick and
tired of you people

915
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:02,646
flaunting your lifestyle choices
in my face all the time.

916
01:00:02,646 --> 01:00:05,115
Oh, so we owe you, right?

917
01:00:05,115 --> 01:00:06,883
You think you got it
all figured out.

918
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:08,218
You don't know shit
about me.

919
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:10,487
Fuck this.
Come on, get your ass—

920
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:12,978
Oh, sure, be mad at me now.

921
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:16,285
Here you go.

922
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,194
Honey,

923
01:00:18,194 --> 01:00:20,497
we were having
such a good time.

924
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:21,798
I'm sorry.

925
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:23,356
I didn't mean to ruin your—

926
01:00:24,401 --> 01:00:26,028
Well, actually, I did.

927
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:29,729
We're getting out of here.

928
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:33,810
Talk to fucking anybody.

929
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,074
That's it,
have some more wine, Dee.

930
01:00:52,829 --> 01:00:54,820
- Hey.
- What the fuck?

931
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:58,329
Fuck you up!

932
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,512
- Hey, man—
- Not now.  Not now.

933
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:53,754
Woman: Thanks, just the
way I like it.

934
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,631
Can I have a beer?

935
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:07,593
How are you doing
this evening?

936
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:11,641
- Something I can get you?
- Yeah.

937
01:02:11,641 --> 01:02:14,711
Hey, man, buddy,
you seem like such a nice guy.

938
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:16,846
I don't want to bother you,
but I'm over there

939
01:02:16,846 --> 01:02:19,716
at that bar taking a leak
and some guy comes in and—

940
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:22,619
I'm sorry, this is terrible.
Let me buy you a drink.

941
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:24,621
Bartender,
let me buy my friend a drink.

942
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:26,723
You're not gonna believe
what happened to—

943
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:28,191
- Gary.
- Gary.

944
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:29,826
Tell him what happened.

945
01:02:29,826 --> 01:02:32,262
I'm over there taking a leak.
Before I know it

946
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:34,697
some guy comes in,
rams his hand in my pocket—

947
01:02:34,697 --> 01:02:37,700
He's pissing on the floor,
he's pissing on the walls—

948
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,370
I'm sorry, this is your story,
go ahead.

949
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:42,472
The motherfucker
makes off with my wallet!

950
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:43,640
That's it.

951
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,208
That's not it.

952
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:48,244
Come on, Gary.  That would be
bad enough, but the thing is,

953
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:51,247
the same exact thing
happened to Gary last week!

954
01:02:51,247 --> 01:02:54,117
Right?  You stopped me on the
street.  You were killing time—

955
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:56,386
Hey, hey!  Fuck you.

956
01:02:56,386 --> 01:02:58,445
Oh, okay, fuck me.

957
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:04,089
Fuck you and fuck you, too,
tough guy!

958
01:03:05,328 --> 01:03:06,556
Fuck you.

959
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,722
Who the fuck
does she think she is?

960
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:35,714
You fuck with me,
I'm gonna fuck with you.

961
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:40,196
That's it.  I don't care
if it's her fucking mother.

962
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:41,998
- Then she wants to go—
- Wait.

963
01:03:41,998 --> 01:03:44,466
This is before or after
you set the kitchen on fire?

964
01:03:46,536 --> 01:03:47,833
It was—

965
01:03:50,306 --> 01:03:53,176
I don't actually remember,
but that's not the point.

966
01:03:53,176 --> 01:03:54,344
The point is,

967
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:57,380
is that I'm not some little
12-year-old baby arsonist here.

968
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,415
I'm setting the fire
to prove a point.

969
01:03:59,415 --> 01:04:01,684
- Sure.
- The point is, fuck her!

970
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:03,720
Am I some little nigger
checkout boy

971
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,822
bagging her fucking
groceries?

972
01:04:05,822 --> 01:04:09,192
No, I am banging the hell
out of her princess daughter.

973
01:04:09,192 --> 01:04:11,023
I'm practically blood.

974
01:04:12,228 --> 01:04:15,598
Then she calls the cops.

975
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:17,267
Like they're going
to give a shit.

976
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:20,770
I was telling these cop
about her little dolls.

977
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,572
And these cops
are just looking at each other

978
01:04:22,572 --> 01:04:24,073
like, “What the fuck
are we doing here?

979
01:04:24,073 --> 01:04:25,475
Let's get the fuck
out of here.”

980
01:04:25,475 --> 01:04:28,111
- Dolls?
- Yeah, she ordered these dolls

981
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:30,046
from these ads,
or some shit.

982
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:31,915
And she won't let me
touch them.

983
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:34,851
You know?  Do I got dirty hands,
or something?

984
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:37,954
Right.  Then meanwhile,
in this whole fucking house

985
01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:39,489
there's not a place
for me to sit,

986
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:44,527
because these dolls are taking
up space like they're guests.

987
01:04:44,527 --> 01:04:45,828
They're fucking relatives.

988
01:04:45,828 --> 01:04:48,331
What am I?
What the hell am I?

989
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:50,200
You're the guy whose banging
her princess daughter.

990
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,467
Fucking “A” right!

991
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:54,537
Which I would think would
entitle me to a place to sit,

992
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:57,165
other than the
fucking toilet upstairs.

993
01:04:58,341 --> 01:05:00,843
So I just lit a cigarette,

994
01:05:00,843 --> 01:05:02,333
like I'm doing right now,

995
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:06,139
and I just went like that.

996
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:10,010
Right on her fucking
kitchen curtains.

997
01:05:14,224 --> 01:05:16,259
Could we get another round?

998
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:17,487
Sure.

999
01:05:25,468 --> 01:05:27,170
How bad was the fire?

1000
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:28,371
As fires go.

1001
01:05:28,371 --> 01:05:32,008
I got the drapes,
I got the windowsill,

1002
01:05:32,008 --> 01:05:33,843
I scorched a little bit
of linoleum.

1003
01:05:33,843 --> 01:05:35,378
But you got
her respect, right?

1004
01:05:35,378 --> 01:05:38,414
Fuck her, man.
I got her attention.

1005
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:40,149
It's a lot better
than her respect.

1006
01:05:40,149 --> 01:05:42,083
That's good for you.

1007
01:06:00,536 --> 01:06:04,240
Alright, I gotta grab a table
for my friends, who are late.

1008
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,742
It was good
talking to you.

1009
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:06,970
- I'm Charlie.
- Dean.

1010
01:06:09,212 --> 01:06:10,270
Alright, Dean.

1011
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:45,782
Your friend's late?

1012
01:06:45,782 --> 01:06:48,551
Yeah, I don't know.

1013
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:50,018
How about you?
Waiting?

1014
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:53,156
Waiting for nothing.

1015
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:55,124
Fucking friends.

1016
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:56,426
Yeah, what?

1017
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:58,861
Nothing, they just,
you know, desert you.

1018
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:00,192
Tell me about it.

1019
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,700
You know, they get married.

1020
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,294
Pretty soon, they're cruising
the mall with their wives.

1021
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,508
- Cigarette?
- Yeah, thank you.

1022
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:13,576
My buddy, last week,

1023
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:16,646
he was the last one to go.

1024
01:07:16,646 --> 01:07:19,816
And was I even asked to be
the best-fucking-man?

1025
01:07:19,816 --> 01:07:21,918
I'll tell you one thing,
I'm never getting married.

1026
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:25,455
I mean,
I like booty and all,

1027
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:28,447
but the fucking grief you 
got to go through to get it, man?

1028
01:07:30,026 --> 01:07:31,084
Fuck that.

1029
01:07:31,194 --> 01:07:33,229
Stop, you're hurting me.  Jerk!

1030
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:34,864
I like my freedom.

1031
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:36,798
Right, yeah.  Freedom.

1032
01:07:44,774 --> 01:07:48,378
My problem is,
I have a very restless nature.

1033
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:50,546
I don't even know what I want
in this life anymore.

1034
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:52,815
Yeah.  Sure.

1035
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:55,351
I think to myself,
I look around, you know?

1036
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:57,720
I think,
“No, uh-uh, bullshit,

1037
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,356
that you, them—
any-fucking-body—

1038
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:03,793
should have what they have
and then me be where I am.”

1039
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:05,784
What I deserve,
that's one.

1040
01:08:12,268 --> 01:08:14,293
This place
is a fucking morgue, huh?

1041
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:19,599
You wanna do a bone?

1042
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:21,838
Sure.

1043
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:30,884
Hey.

1044
01:08:33,456 --> 01:08:36,857
Next on our channel,
we got “At Home with Homos.”

1045
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:41,721
Yeah, well—

1046
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:47,069
I guess it's not 2½ kids
and a dog, right?

1047
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:49,697
They don't have dogs, man.
They're too big.

1048
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:54,140
You ever hear what they do
with their pets?

1049
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:57,710
No, I hadn't
heard that one.

1050
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:01,551
Now, I'm betting baldy
is the bitch

1051
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:03,986
and the goateed man
is the buck.

1052
01:09:03,986 --> 01:09:05,188
What do you think?

1053
01:09:05,188 --> 01:09:07,418
Alright,
I'll take that bet, Dean.

1054
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:11,316
You got a bitch at home?

1055
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:17,166
Yeah, shit,
Charlie's pussy whipped.

1056
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:19,464
You do the knives,
she does the spoons, right?

1057
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:26,641
No, I was spoons.

1058
01:09:29,145 --> 01:09:31,047
Have you no shame?

1059
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:32,480
Not since I met you.

1060
01:09:35,852 --> 01:09:37,587
I saw you
on the bus today.

1061
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:39,388
Not me.

1062
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:42,825
Everywhere I go in the city,
there you are.

1063
01:09:42,825 --> 01:09:45,157
I see you, I talk to you.

1064
01:09:46,295 --> 01:09:48,397
What do I say?

1065
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:50,524
There's a whole lot
of “yes.”

1066
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:05,536
What?

1067
01:10:06,482 --> 01:10:09,285
What would the city look like
if you weren't here?

1068
01:10:09,285 --> 01:10:10,553
I'm here.

1069
01:10:10,553 --> 01:10:12,521
I'm yours.

1070
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:15,848
And you will always
be mine, right?

1071
01:10:17,627 --> 01:10:19,822
See, I can talk
romantic, too.

1072
01:10:22,965 --> 01:10:24,694
Don't they know
people are watching?

1073
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:28,371
Yeah, exactly.

1074
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:31,807
Come on, let's go to the corner
and get a bottle of something.

1075
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:36,441
Fucking freaks.

1076
01:10:40,182 --> 01:10:43,352
Man, that's how sick
these fuckers are, man.

1077
01:10:43,352 --> 01:10:44,979
They'd do anything.

1078
01:10:52,662 --> 01:10:54,797
Hey, here you go.

1079
01:10:54,797 --> 01:10:56,025
Thanks.

1080
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:03,906
What are you
smiling at?

1081
01:11:03,906 --> 01:11:05,635
He's smiling at you.

1082
01:11:07,743 --> 01:11:09,478
I guess he likes
the look.

1083
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:11,447
Yeah, they like
what they see.

1084
01:11:11,447 --> 01:11:13,677
Yeah, I got the look
these fuckers like.

1085
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:23,082
Let's go over there.

1086
01:11:24,694 --> 01:11:26,963
- What?
- Let's go over there.

1087
01:11:26,963 --> 01:11:29,465
- Why?
- I want to get closer.

1088
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:33,035
- Why?
- We'll have some fun.

1089
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:34,195
Come on.

1090
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:09,872
I feel like I'm on safari

1091
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:11,999
watching the fucking wildlife.

1092
01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:21,984
Why do you think it was
that the Almighty Christ

1093
01:12:21,984 --> 01:12:23,713
put these fags on earth?

1094
01:12:24,754 --> 01:12:28,224
Like, I don't know,
like a giraffe?

1095
01:12:28,224 --> 01:12:30,590
What's the fucking point
of a giraffe?

1096
01:12:32,028 --> 01:12:34,664
Was it strictly
for our amusement?

1097
01:12:34,664 --> 01:12:37,800
I guess now He figures,
“Nah, fuck this.

1098
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,101
The joke's over.

1099
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:42,127
Just get rid of these fuckers
once and for all.”

1100
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,342
Right?

1101
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:47,502
What do you think?

1102
01:12:49,278 --> 01:12:51,280
I don't know, you tell me.

1103
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,440
Shit.

1104
01:12:53,449 --> 01:12:54,882
I'm sure I don't know.

1105
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:01,190
It's like my cousin.

1106
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:04,560
I got this cousin,
he's retarded.

1107
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,393
That's not his fault.
He's helpless.

1108
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:11,467
See that there?

1109
01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:13,569
He goes through life
not knowing,

1110
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:15,838
but they fucking see.

1111
01:13:15,838 --> 01:13:19,308
They ride the train like
everybody else.

1112
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:22,978
They see men
and they see women together.

1113
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:24,480
They have to see.

1114
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,184
They see the mothers,
fathers, sisters, husbands.

1115
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:31,176
It's the way the whole world
is supposed to be.

1116
01:13:36,692 --> 01:13:38,828
Maybe it's not a choice.

1117
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:40,429
Bullshit.

1118
01:13:40,429 --> 01:13:41,864
Bullshit, man.

1119
01:13:41,864 --> 01:13:43,999
Are you telling me
that it's not a choice

1120
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:46,331
to have a fucking
dick down your throat?

1121
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:50,106
Bullshit, Charlie.

1122
01:13:50,106 --> 01:13:52,174
Hey, fucker!

1123
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:55,244
Let me tell you something!
My father died of cancer!

1124
01:13:55,244 --> 01:13:57,546
Alright, that's a real
fucking disease!

1125
01:13:57,546 --> 01:14:00,182
He didn't bite it by putting
some cock in his ass!

1126
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:03,379
Man: We won't mind, baby.

1127
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,322
That's why
I fucking hate them.

1128
01:14:06,322 --> 01:14:08,991
I'll tell you something,
they enjoy the abuse.

1129
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:10,593
You know that?

1130
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:12,461
They're like the spooks.

1131
01:14:12,461 --> 01:14:15,498
I mean it's like—
oh, you done this thing to me.

1132
01:14:15,498 --> 01:14:17,489
What am I supposed
to feel, guilt?

1133
01:14:20,402 --> 01:14:22,772
Hey, hey! Fuck you!

1134
01:14:22,772 --> 01:14:26,976
Man: Okay, baby,
fuck me, fuck me!

1135
01:14:26,976 --> 01:14:29,712
Zoo time.  Let's go.

1136
01:14:29,712 --> 01:14:32,214
Hey, hey, hey, Dean.

1137
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:34,250
Just relax, alright?
Fuck it.

1138
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,185
Come on, let's go outside.

1139
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:38,949
Come on.
Let's walk outside.

1140
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:42,792
Yeah, like when
the moment's...

1141
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:44,460
- Yeah.
- ...right.

1142
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,485
When the moment's right.

1143
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,158
Man: Aw, don't go
away mad, baby.

1144
01:14:57,907 --> 01:14:59,238
Alright?

1145
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:04,880
I'll tell you something,

1146
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,516
everybody—

1147
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:10,519
especially this whole
fucking crowd here—

1148
01:15:10,519 --> 01:15:12,419
is out to judge you.

1149
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:27,866
I'm sorry about your father.

1150
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:33,301
I don't give a flying fuck
about my father.

1151
01:15:36,579 --> 01:15:38,308
He was a mean fucker.

1152
01:15:39,715 --> 01:15:43,412
He was a fucker
with a capital <i>fuck</i>.

1153
01:15:47,823 --> 01:15:49,450
I don't know.

1154
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:12,337
Jesus H. Christ,
that's a fucking look.

1155
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:15,342
Hey.

1156
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:17,987
- Hey.
- How you doing?

1157
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:19,255
I'm doing great.

1158
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:21,857
Yeah?  Okay.
Glad to hear it.

1159
01:16:21,857 --> 01:16:24,426
- I'm Don.
- Well, I'm Dean.

1160
01:16:24,426 --> 01:16:26,695
- Hey.
- Hey.

1161
01:16:26,695 --> 01:16:28,697
Charlie.

1162
01:16:28,697 --> 01:16:31,500
So uh—

1163
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,935
wanna take a walk?

1164
01:16:32,935 --> 01:16:35,426
I don't go no where
without my bud.

1165
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,976
Oh, you're—
you two are together.

1166
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:41,965
Yeah.

1167
01:16:46,715 --> 01:16:49,051
Oh, let's go.

1168
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:50,152
Where?

1169
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:53,355
Oh, can't wait, can you?

1170
01:16:53,355 --> 01:16:56,256
Yeah, he needs it
all the time, Donny.

1171
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:04,500
Follow my lead.
Trust me, it's fun.

1172
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,201
Dean.

1173
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:07,793
Zoo time.

1174
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:14,698
Hey.

1175
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:23,085
I'm just so thirsty.

1176
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:25,087
Oh, you are, huh?

1177
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:26,088
So?

1178
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:28,886
What are you
gonna do with me?

1179
01:17:29,925 --> 01:17:32,826
I can think
of a few things.

1180
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,400
You're not going to forget
my buddy, are you?

1181
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:43,405
Hey, Charlie,
come on over here

1182
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:45,771
and tell me
what your bud likes.

1183
01:17:56,785 --> 01:17:58,420
Don't mind us.

1184
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,945
Hey, holy shit, I know you.

1185
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:04,093
You're my highschool
biology teacher.

1186
01:18:04,093 --> 01:18:08,063
Look at you, Don Wagner,
don't you look scary tonight.

1187
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:10,899
Hey, come on, I'm not going
to tell anyone!

1188
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:12,924
Sorry.
He's a dick.

1189
01:18:14,136 --> 01:18:16,138
We're going over
to The Lure if you—

1190
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:17,730
No, thanks.

1191
01:18:21,744 --> 01:18:24,577
Oh come on,Don,
come back!

1192
01:18:33,222 --> 01:18:34,883
You got a car?

1193
01:18:35,891 --> 01:18:38,121
- Yeah, if I can find it.
- Come on.

1194
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:58,904
« You take me back to the place
where I cease to exist »

1195
01:19:00,182 --> 01:19:02,650
« To find a kiss »

1196
01:19:04,186 --> 01:19:06,154
« Something I missed »

1197
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:15,154
« You burn away my disguise
and galaxies fall »

1198
01:19:16,031 --> 01:19:18,295
« Because of this »

1199
01:19:19,935 --> 01:19:22,301
« Because of this »

1200
01:19:38,654 --> 01:19:41,490
I remember this quilt.

1201
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:44,186
I remember waking up
drooling on this quilt.

1202
01:19:46,428 --> 01:19:48,464
It's one of my fonder memories,
actually,

1203
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:50,022
just sleeping together,

1204
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,601
with you.

1205
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:55,069
I like it up there.
It gives me peace.

1206
01:19:56,638 --> 01:19:58,265
Good.
That's good for you.

1207
01:20:00,275 --> 01:20:02,140
How are you liking it here?

1208
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:04,442
It's fine.

1209
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:09,243
It's a nice place.
Very white, like you.

1210
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:12,020
- A vision.
- Charlie—

1211
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,956
Hey, I've been good.

1212
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:15,753
I've stayed away.

1213
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,419
Welcome Wagon.
This is nice.

1214
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,866
It's 4:00 in the morning.

1215
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:27,136
And you're looking
a little gamey.

1216
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,770
Did you set
your clock back?

1217
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,101
You get an extra hour.

1218
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:31,373
Thanks.

1219
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:33,175
So it's not as late
as you think.

1220
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:34,335
Yes, it is.

1221
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:41,650
It's been
old home week tonight.

1222
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:43,015
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1223
01:20:44,186 --> 01:20:46,388
I saw one of
our friends tonight.

1224
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:47,789
What?

1225
01:20:47,789 --> 01:20:49,381
And this time
he was alone.

1226
01:20:51,326 --> 01:20:53,896
- Wake up, Dean.
- Fuck.  I'm driving.

1227
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:55,557
Uh-uh.

1228
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:00,869
Well I was driving.

1229
01:21:00,869 --> 01:21:03,702
Still sick?
Too much Cuervo?

1230
01:21:05,974 --> 01:21:07,737
You're taking me home, right?

1231
01:21:09,978 --> 01:21:12,781
- You don't know where I live.
- Don't worry, buddy.

1232
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:14,772
I've got everything
under control.

1233
01:21:16,552 --> 01:21:19,188
- I can drive.
- Hear any good stories lately?

1234
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:21,390
I don't feel—

1235
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:23,592
Is that a “no”?

1236
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:25,389
Let me see if I know any.

1237
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:28,764
What?

1238
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:30,199
I've got a good one.

1239
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:32,501
And this one really happened,
I swear.

1240
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:35,304
It's another example
of the universe saying,

1241
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:37,973
“Just when you thought
you were safe—

1242
01:21:37,973 --> 01:21:39,873
wrong place, wrong time.”

1243
01:21:43,545 --> 01:21:46,412
Just give me a second
to figure out the ending.

1244
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,021
Where are you going?

1245
01:21:53,021 --> 01:21:54,386
I gotta pee.

1246
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:02,021
You ever hear the one about
the guy named, um—?

1247
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:09,037
The guy who hung out in the big
city with his buddies,

1248
01:22:09,037 --> 01:22:13,242
lurking around a certain kind
of urban nightlife?

1249
01:22:13,242 --> 01:22:14,576
- You know the kind.
- Charlie.

1250
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:15,611
Listen.

1251
01:22:15,611 --> 01:22:17,446
One night
this guy was lurking.

1252
01:22:17,446 --> 01:22:20,215
And this night
in particular,

1253
01:22:20,215 --> 01:22:21,773
he's feeling
kind of blue

1254
01:22:23,252 --> 01:22:25,554
because his friends
had all deserted him.

1255
01:22:25,554 --> 01:22:28,757
So he's sitting in this bar
and next to him is this fellow,

1256
01:22:28,757 --> 01:22:30,359
not part of the urban nightlife,

1257
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:33,428
not one of them.

1258
01:22:33,428 --> 01:22:34,796
This one is normal.

1259
01:22:34,796 --> 01:22:36,632
Guy has a newfound pal.

1260
01:22:36,632 --> 01:22:39,201
So they talk and they drink.

1261
01:22:39,201 --> 01:22:42,271
The guy's already drunk.
He's been drunk since he was 13.

1262
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:46,708
So he guzzles and guzzles
and he wakes up in a field...

1263
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:51,179
Here's good.

1264
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:53,749
You need fucking
driving lessons, man.

1265
01:22:53,749 --> 01:22:55,851
...in a haze of tequila.

1266
01:22:55,851 --> 01:22:57,719
Whoa, baby.

1267
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:00,552
...a daze of
white-hot headlights.

1268
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,979
Oh, shit.

1269
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:05,927
Isn't this great,

1270
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:09,197
just the two of us on the road,
being men together?

1271
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:11,199
And then it
all becomes clear.

1272
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:14,002
What the fuck's going on?

1273
01:23:14,002 --> 01:23:16,838
Things suddenly, horrifically,
fall into focus.

1274
01:23:16,838 --> 01:23:17,896
I'll show you, Dean.

1275
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,046
I'll put it in away
that you can understand.

1276
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:28,350
Your newfound pal
is one of them.

1277
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,552
Your newfound pal.

1278
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:33,188
- Jesus, man!
- What I'm amazed at, Dean, is—

1279
01:23:33,188 --> 01:23:34,416
Look at me.

1280
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:37,916
Nothing.

1281
01:23:39,261 --> 01:23:41,797
I know it's been five months,
but—shit!

1282
01:23:41,797 --> 01:23:44,800
I'm your bud now, what the fuck
are you talking about?

1283
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,570
- Don't you?  Really?
- No.

1284
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,561
Let me clear your head
a bit for you.

1285
01:23:52,107 --> 01:23:56,244
What the fuck was I, Dean,
some one-nighter to you?

1286
01:23:56,244 --> 01:23:57,506
Look, man—

1287
01:23:59,581 --> 01:24:00,582
You want me to fuck you?

1288
01:24:00,582 --> 01:24:02,584
You want me to fuck you,
you little cunt?

1289
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,186
Huh, you want me
to fuck you, cunt?

1290
01:24:04,186 --> 01:24:06,017
- Is that what you want?
- No.

1291
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:26,262
Chris—

1292
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:29,607
You like that?  Huh?

1293
01:24:30,612 --> 01:24:32,307
- Chris—
- Feel good to you?

1294
01:24:35,984 --> 01:24:38,418
You trying to scare me?
Is that what you're doing?

1295
01:24:40,856 --> 01:24:42,958
Jesus, did some—

1296
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:45,761
something—

1297
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:48,263
something happen to you?

1298
01:24:48,263 --> 01:24:50,527
What did you do?

1299
01:24:53,702 --> 01:24:56,262
I made him sorry
he ever laid eyes on us.

1300
01:25:04,713 --> 01:25:06,047
Jesus!  Fuck!

1301
01:25:06,047 --> 01:25:07,916
Let me tell you though,
just last week,

1302
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:10,118
I see you on the street,
this cock of the walk—

1303
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:12,821
a black T-shirt,
black boots, black jeans,

1304
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:15,657
and my head
in force of habit turns.

1305
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:17,759
That body, that ass!

1306
01:25:17,759 --> 01:25:19,928
I just stood there admiring,
and then it turned,

1307
01:25:19,928 --> 01:25:20,917
and it was you.

1308
01:25:25,367 --> 01:25:27,528
There's nothing like drooling
over the fucker who—

1309
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:31,940
Fuck.

1310
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,341
I thought I missed
my chance,

1311
01:25:33,341 --> 01:25:35,210
that I was gonna go
my whole life—

1312
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:38,713
but then I see you tonight.
Just you and me.

1313
01:25:38,713 --> 01:25:40,949
Make sure
that cunt's watching.

1314
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:43,543
- Fuckin' destiny.
- Get down.  Get down!

1315
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:57,232
Are you cold?

1316
01:25:57,232 --> 01:25:58,790
I had to warm you up.

1317
01:26:00,469 --> 01:26:03,063
I can get you heated up
in no time, Dean.

1318
01:26:04,372 --> 01:26:06,241
Take your
fucking pants down.

1319
01:26:06,241 --> 01:26:08,106
- What?
- Take your fucking pants off!

1320
01:26:09,344 --> 01:26:11,580
You fucking faggot.

1321
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:12,842
You fuckin' little faggot!

1322
01:26:14,382 --> 01:26:16,418
Fuckin' pussy.
You get me fucking drunk.

1323
01:26:16,418 --> 01:26:18,420
I expect you to put out!

1324
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:19,588
What kind of
a date is this?

1325
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:22,324
I'm going to cut your heart out,
you know that?

1326
01:26:22,324 --> 01:26:24,059
I've been there already, Dean.

1327
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:25,788
Don't worry,
I haven't forgotten you.

1328
01:26:27,062 --> 01:26:28,154
You do good work.

1329
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:31,193
Just so you'll always know
you're mine.

1330
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,176
- I'm begging you.
- Yeah, that's the spirit.

1331
01:26:41,176 --> 01:26:42,871
Get up.

1332
01:26:45,847 --> 01:26:47,782
Fuck you.

1333
01:26:47,782 --> 01:26:51,686
Alright, you little faggot,
you want to see it so bad?

1334
01:26:51,686 --> 01:26:52,948
Fine.

1335
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:03,122
Jesus fucking Christ,
Dean—

1336
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:06,067
this is exciting to you?

1337
01:27:06,067 --> 01:27:08,035
Fuck you!

1338
01:27:09,871 --> 01:27:11,840
What do you
want from me?

1339
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,535
Get down.  Get down!

1340
01:27:16,211 --> 01:27:17,312
Huh?

1341
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:19,648
Why don't you lick my tit?

1342
01:27:19,648 --> 01:27:22,412
- What?
- Lick my tit, you faggot!

1343
01:27:30,525 --> 01:27:31,753
You like that?

1344
01:27:32,928 --> 01:27:34,054
Let's try a little lower.

1345
01:27:40,535 --> 01:27:41,636
There you go.

1346
01:27:41,636 --> 01:27:42,898
Oh, feel it.

1347
01:27:49,344 --> 01:27:51,539
See that?
The fucking faggot.

1348
01:27:54,883 --> 01:27:56,585
I want you to know
you're mine.

1349
01:27:56,585 --> 01:27:57,677
Get down on
your fucking knees.

1350
01:28:01,423 --> 01:28:02,412
Get down, Dean!

1351
01:28:14,836 --> 01:28:16,463
Open your mouth.

1352
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:21,466
Let me see your tongue.

1353
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:25,970
You want to give this
some head?

1354
01:28:27,282 --> 01:28:30,513
Does that feel all nice
in the back of your throat?

1355
01:28:31,286 --> 01:28:33,948
Or do you want the real thing,
is that it, Dean?

1356
01:28:34,956 --> 01:28:36,082
Is that what you want?

1357
01:28:37,993 --> 01:28:39,824
Dean?

1358
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:45,697
Dean?

1359
01:28:46,601 --> 01:28:48,501
Dean?

1360
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:53,873
Dean.

1361
01:29:42,624 --> 01:29:44,426
Chris.

1362
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:45,927
Stop it!

1363
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:47,829
Stop it!

1364
01:29:47,829 --> 01:29:50,821
Chris!  No!  Stop it!

1365
01:30:08,616 --> 01:30:09,878
Oh God.

1366
01:30:32,407 --> 01:30:33,942
Total eye-for-an-eye.

1367
01:30:33,942 --> 01:30:35,710
It was positively biblical.

1368
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:36,644
This happened?

1369
01:30:36,644 --> 01:30:39,848
The fucker was an epileptic,
so I put him out of his misery.

1370
01:30:39,848 --> 01:30:41,549
Bullshit.

1371
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:44,119
You barge in here
4:00 in the morning—

1372
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:45,253
3:00.

1373
01:30:45,253 --> 01:30:48,323
—with some bullshit story.
I know you.

1374
01:30:48,323 --> 01:30:50,291
Not anymore.
I'm an absolute shit.

1375
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:51,526
- Congrats.
- People fuck with me,

1376
01:30:51,526 --> 01:30:52,527
I fuck with them.
That's it.

1377
01:30:52,527 --> 01:30:54,262
So you're the man now?

1378
01:30:54,262 --> 01:30:55,797
I can protect you, Chris.

1379
01:30:55,797 --> 01:30:57,198
Thanks, but—

1380
01:30:57,198 --> 01:30:58,933
Look at me.

1381
01:30:58,933 --> 01:31:01,269
People mess with us,
they'll know.

1382
01:31:01,269 --> 01:31:02,604
I'd kill for you.

1383
01:31:02,604 --> 01:31:05,038
But you didn't, did you?

1384
01:31:06,307 --> 01:31:08,070
Did you?

1385
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:10,971
No.

1386
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:14,414
I know you.

1387
01:31:18,219 --> 01:31:20,855
- Tell me.
- What?

1388
01:31:20,855 --> 01:31:22,083
What did you fucking do?

1389
01:31:28,963 --> 01:31:31,332
I had him up—

1390
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:33,800
He didn't remember me,
but I had him.

1391
01:31:35,003 --> 01:31:36,732
I was gonna—

1392
01:31:37,772 --> 01:31:39,040
Fuck.

1393
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,405
I was gonna—

1394
01:31:42,744 --> 01:31:45,046
I swear I was
gonna kill him,

1395
01:31:45,046 --> 01:31:47,515
or at least
fuck him up really bad.

1396
01:31:47,515 --> 01:31:50,218
I don't know.

1397
01:31:50,218 --> 01:31:51,886
It was just happening,
you know,

1398
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:53,955
the way that night
happened to us.

1399
01:31:53,955 --> 01:31:56,116
Only this time,
we were on top.

1400
01:31:57,892 --> 01:32:01,623
And then he had that fit,
the fucker.

1401
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:14,202
And I just thought about you,
and I couldn't—

1402
01:32:16,611 --> 01:32:20,240
There's no point in him.
In what he did to us.

1403
01:32:21,349 --> 01:32:24,614
There was no point in me at what
I was going to do to him.

1404
01:32:26,754 --> 01:32:29,552
There's no fucking point.

1405
01:32:46,407 --> 01:32:48,034
Hey.

1406
01:33:10,164 --> 01:33:11,153
Well—

1407
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:15,232
it's nice to know you've
embraced the healing process.

1408
01:33:17,038 --> 01:33:19,240
But first we'll need
a better story.

1409
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,504
The beginning, middle, dead.

1410
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:26,207
Everyone will be talking about us.
And you know that it was true.

1411
01:33:29,918 --> 01:33:31,783
We'd be the stuff of legend.

1412
01:33:33,087 --> 01:33:34,884
Nice try, babe.

1413
01:33:35,924 --> 01:33:39,427
It would have made i tall
worthwhile.

1414
01:33:39,427 --> 01:33:41,019
Almost.

1415
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:45,400
- I want it to be over.
- It is.

1416
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,697
No, I want—

1417
01:33:50,338 --> 01:33:52,363
I want it out of our lives.

1418
01:33:53,942 --> 01:33:55,933
I want it out of me.

1419
01:33:57,245 --> 01:33:59,314
- I want you in me.
- Charlie.

1420
01:33:59,314 --> 01:34:01,482
I want you back.

1421
01:34:01,482 --> 01:34:03,451
I want you.
I earned you, goddammit.

1422
01:34:03,451 --> 01:34:06,154
Charlie, I love you,

1423
01:34:06,154 --> 01:34:08,714
but you don't get
to just erase this.

1424
01:34:12,894 --> 01:34:14,725
And you don't get
to win me back.

1425
01:34:15,997 --> 01:34:17,658
Why not?

1426
01:34:24,205 --> 01:34:26,674
- Shit happens.
- No, fuck that.

1427
01:34:26,674 --> 01:34:28,403
I will not let shit
happen to me!

1428
01:34:37,585 --> 01:34:39,849
I can't do that.

1429
01:35:07,849 --> 01:35:10,044
Oh God, I'm sorry.

1430
01:35:14,822 --> 01:35:15,982
Hold on.

1431
01:35:36,244 --> 01:35:37,541
Oh God.

1432
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,272
I'm sorry.

1433
01:35:42,283 --> 01:35:44,945
It's okay.
Come here.

1434
01:35:57,398 --> 01:36:00,026
I've come home
from the wars.

1435
01:36:03,905 --> 01:36:05,532
This isn't home.

1436
01:36:07,475 --> 01:36:09,644
You're the only home
I know.

1437
01:36:09,644 --> 01:36:11,271
Charlie.

1438
01:36:19,954 --> 01:36:21,387
This isn't home.

1439
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:26,157
{ Wanted - Lover Slain }

1440
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,034
Charlie: Chris!  No!

1441
01:37:09,103 --> 01:37:11,298
Chris!
Help us.

1442
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:23,849
Please help us.

1443
01:37:30,024 --> 01:37:32,652
Just hold on, sweetheart.

1444
01:39:05,353 --> 01:39:07,082
Hey, what happened?

1445
01:39:08,923 --> 01:39:09,981
You okay?

1446
01:39:12,793 --> 01:39:16,456
I'm up.  I'm up.

1447
01:39:19,533 --> 01:39:21,364
Where's your coat?

1448
01:39:28,843 --> 01:39:31,209
Did you set your clock back?

1449
01:39:35,349 --> 01:39:36,839
Listen,

1450
01:39:40,154 --> 01:39:41,587
you take my coat, okay?

1451
01:39:42,923 --> 01:39:44,959
Then what will you do?

1452
01:39:44,959 --> 01:39:46,654
I'm going to go inside.

1453
01:39:48,095 --> 01:39:49,960
Right.

1454
01:39:53,267 --> 01:39:54,666
Go ahead, put it on.

1455
01:40:22,196 --> 01:40:23,754
I'm Bill.

1456
01:40:26,334 --> 01:40:27,858
I'm Charlie.
