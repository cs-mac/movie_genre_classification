00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:51,004
Grover and Stevens, big guy.

158
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,045
It's two people.

159
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,914
But is... is this bill good,
or is it bad?

160
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:56,794
I mean, who are we, really, to judge?

161
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:58,794
Because at the end of the day,

162
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,794
there's only one judge that matters...

163
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,320
a young carpenter.

164
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:06,504
Okay. You know what this is.

165
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,174
Don't fall for it.
This is a funny distraction.

166
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,964
It's cute. I like it. I like you.

167
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:16,624
So let's laugh at this and get
back to work fixing our city.

168
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,084
As you know, Drea,

169
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:25,504
I am the proud son of
a steelworker and her husband.

170
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,965
Yes.

171
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:28,504
My folks weren't rich,

172
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:31,124
but what they lacked in wealth
they made up for with love.

173
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,045
Point being,

174
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:35,294
I'm proud to have led the effort
to restore the City Commons,

175
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:36,675
- which is now well under way.
- Whoa.

176
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:39,084
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up.

177
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:42,544
Um, it's not every day that
you hear "proud"

178
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:44,930
and "City Commons"
used in the same sentence.

179
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:46,044
I mean, I was just there.

180
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,174
Have you actually ever
been there, Mr. Gunt?

181
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:50,175
I know these people have.

182
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:52,754
I mean, there is so much trash,

183
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:55,300
Google Maps has it listed as a mountain.

184
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,625
You know what I'm saying?

185
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,214
Like, a saw a rat riding a toboggan

186
00:05:58,215 --> 00:05:59,964
down one of them things the other day.

187
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:02,714
It's so much trash,
Bravo gave it a second season.

188
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:07,906
Which is why I pledge that, by 2020,

189
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:10,726
all that trash will be gone.

190
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:12,124
And by "gone,"

191
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,834
he means underneath the new
trash from 2018 and 2019.

192
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,874
I mean, come on, help me out here, fam.

193
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,174
I mean, how many of y'all
drove here today

194
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:23,464
in a busted-up car from all
of our busted-up streets?

195
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:25,124
And who's going home tonight

196
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,044
to a building with boarded-up windows?

197
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:28,636
I mean, hey, it beats

198
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:30,856
looking at all that gang
graffiti, though, right?

199
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:36,334
I mean, don't... don't tell us
about our reality, Mr. Gunt.

200
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:38,754
Because we live our reality every day.

201
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:40,674
I hate to interrupt
the dog-and-pony show,

202
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:43,624
but urban development, it takes time.
You wouldn't know that.

203
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,006
What are you doing?

204
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,673
Oh, I'm just calling [bleep].

205
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,124
- Okay.
- Mr. Rose.

206
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,374
Mr. Rose, now seems like a
fitting time for this question.

207
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,914
Are you running for mayor of Fort Grey,

208
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,600
or are you promoting a rap album?

209
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,914
Wow. Wow, I have to say that I am hurt

210
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:04,593
that you think that I would be
here to sell some silly album

211
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,860
that's already available on my website

212
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,124
at www.MusicByCourtney.com.

213
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:14,834
Can we stop this?
Can a grown-up please intervene?

214
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:19,687
These lovely voters have been asking
that same question for 25 years.

215
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:21,051
Pow, pow!

216
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:22,751
You know what?

217
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,841
You folks have been great.

218
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:27,251
I'm Courtney Rose! Out! Peace!

219
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,591
Welcome back to Channel 8's

220
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:31,461
around-the-clock election coverage.

221
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:33,921
This is incredible.

222
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:35,671
Ever since the debate last week,

223
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,511
my mix tape is getting some crazy love.

224
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:38,961
Guess how many total downloads.

225
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:40,751
Conservative? 20 million.

226
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,503
20 million? Brah, that would put me

227
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,051
in between The Beatles and Rihanna.

228
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:45,801
Forgive me for believing in you,
Courtney.

229
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:47,549
<i>And, Beau, it looks like we'll be able</i>

230
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,214
- <i>to do that right away.</i>
- What's happening?

231
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,672
- Mom, we all out of the good soap?
- <i>...our friends from Fort Grey Free Press</i>

232
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:53,212
- <i>have the election calculations for us.</i>
- The antibacterial?

233
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:54,801
Why isn't every soap antibacterial?

234
00:07:54,802 --> 00:07:55,851
- <i>And I certainly cannot.</i>
- Shh!

235
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:59,437
<i>It appears as if local rapper
Courtney Rose</i>

236
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:02,011
<i>is our projected winner
in the race for mayor</i>

237
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:03,252
<i>of Fort Grey, California.</i>

238
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:05,317
- Oh!
- <i>Wow!</i>

239
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:07,131
What? What happened?

240
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:08,381
<i>Wow.</i>

241
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:09,711
What happened is...

242
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:10,961
you the mayor.

243
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:16,052
Well [bleep].

244
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,374
Hey, this has to be a mistake.

245
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,280
I mean, Russia clearly tampered
with the voting machines, right?

246
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,766
I don't think it's a mistake, man.
I mean, the media is never wrong.

247
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:25,966
So what do I do?

248
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,602
I mean, how do you go about
not being the mayor?

249
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:30,272
Well, the first step would probably be

250
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:31,482
not running for mayor.

251
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:33,152
Okay, you want my two cents?

252
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:34,692
Uh, listen. Hear me out, okay?

253
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,232
I say you serve for one day only.

254
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,892
That way, you can get the scissors.

255
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,152
- The scissors?
- The scissors.

256
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,732
The... The... The giant scissors
they give mayors to cut ribbons.

257
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,732
It's politics 101, man.
Come on, stop playin'.

258
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,392
Oh, yeah, I-I'm gonna go down
to City Hall and tell the clerk,

259
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:51,062
"Hard pass, but I'm still
putting this on my résumé."

260
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,652
- Oh, no. No, you...
- No! Go get the scissors.

261
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:55,062
- Yes, I am, because...
- Fire!

262
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:56,063
Oh, oh, oh!

263
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:58,772
Wh-Where is it?!

264
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,062
It just means that we're going out

265
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:01,232
to the fire escape to have a talk.

266
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,812
I can see how it can be
a little confusing.

267
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:04,286
Ms. Dina, you can't yell "fire"

268
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,852
- at black people like that.
- That's all you had to say.

269
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:07,272
- I'm skittish. I get to...
- You got to leave it.

270
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:10,892
I've given you a lot of
straight talk on this, uh...

271
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:13,022
oh, let's just call it a balcony.

272
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:15,692
"The fountain at the mall
is not a pool, Courtney.

273
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,892
No, you will not be
piercing that, Courtney."

274
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:21,232
Courtney, listen to me.

275
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:24,312
You put your name on a ballot.

276
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,442
In this country, that means something.

277
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:27,982
It carries consequences.

278
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,812
It's you telling the people,

279
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:31,772
"I want to make your life better."

280
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,892
And tonight, the people said, "Okay."

281
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:36,772
Yeah, but they couldn't
just buy my ringtone?

282
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:39,392
Tell me something. Why do you rap?

283
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:41,192
That cash-money lifestyle, obviously.

284
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:42,522
Do not be cute.

285
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:45,352
You rap because you're...
you're a commentator.

286
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:46,732
You're an observer.

287
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:49,482
You critique the status quo.

288
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:52,692
Baby, maybe now you can
actually change it.

289
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,482
Wow.

290
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:57,152
Ma, I have to say,
that was hella poignant.

291
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:03,772
You know what, Ma?

292
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,312
I think I got this.

293
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,352
- Damn right you do.
- Yeah.

294
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:09,312
Who my baby? My baby the mayor!

295
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,522
Whoa! Whoa!

296
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:13,772
What are you...

297
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,772
I'm sorry. Did I invade your privacy?

298
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:17,852
Get used to it.
You're a public figure now.

299
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:19,192
Cream with three sugars.

300
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:21,602
Are you here to, like, assassinate me?

301
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:23,852
Well, we'll see
how the conversation goes.

302
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:26,272
Courtney... I want to run your staff.

303
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:29,732
If I can turn all of this into
a halfway functioning mayor,

304
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,652
well, then I will just join the pantheon

305
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,062
of female political masterminds,

306
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:34,732
just crushing every Kellyanne Conway

307
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,102
and Donna Brazile in my path.

308
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,652
I'm very intimidated
by other women's success.

309
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:40,352
That was a joke.

310
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:41,603
Hilarious. Relevant.

311
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,732
Courtney, listen, do yourself a favor.
Let me help you.

312
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,812
I know it needs to get done,
and I know how to do it.

313
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,982
Wow. You do bring a lot to the table.

314
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,732
Three citywide campaigns,
two years with the Comptroller,

315
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,522
and what does that all add up to?

316
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:55,102
A very unsexy LinkedIn page.

317
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:56,106
Like, seriously, you got to zazz

318
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,154
- this up or something.
- Okay.

319
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,392
I'm gonna need to know
that you're committed,

320
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:00,272
'cause I don't work seven days
a week for someone who's not.

321
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:02,102
Well, to show how committed I am,

322
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:04,602
I am going to clear
my entire touring schedule.

323
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:06,594
I doubt you have a touring
schedule, but we'll go with it.

324
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:09,272
So it's a deal.

325
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,022
Mm.

326
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,392
Great, and, look, Courtney,

327
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:14,352
I've been around a lot of politicians,

328
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:16,982
and... you have something special.

329
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:18,948
- Yeah, what's that?
- Me.

330
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:32,022
I found you the absolute best
staffers in the county...

331
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:33,606
but they weren't available.

332
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,594
Hi. I'm Kitty Kavanagh.

333
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:37,982
I'm handling your press.

334
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:40,353
- I'm very excited to learn your voice.
- Oh, boy.

335
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,772
- Dick Papadopolous, DMV guy.
- Hi.

336
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:45,652
We let people self-report
their weight on licenses,

337
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,692
so I'm okay bending the truth.

338
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:50,383
- Okay.
- Thank you for that.

339
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:51,584
I'll remember that. It's disturbing.

340
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:52,892
Okay, we will get started.

341
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:53,893
- Sorry we're late.
- What's up?

342
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:55,652
- Hey!
- We had to buy notebooks.

343
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:57,812
Uh, I'm assuming we bill this
to the city?

344
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:59,229
I'll start a file.

345
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:00,575
- What's going on?
- Huh? Oh.

346
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:01,663
I hired a few staffers.

347
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,983
These boys know Fort Grey
inside and out.

348
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:06,084
And if I needed a pizza
delivered in 60 minutes or less,

349
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:07,677
- they would be my guys.
- I can do it in 12.

350
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:10,075
Doesn't matter. All right, so,
we start the transition

351
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:11,875
with figuring out the first 100 days.

352
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:14,335
What I like to do is use index cards

353
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:16,575
to organize the important issues.

354
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:18,495
So, as you can see,

355
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:20,995
green index cards are for
fiscal issues, obviously.

356
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:23,375
Blue index cards are for social issues.

357
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,786
- Red index cards are for...
- Oh, if I hear "index cards" one more time,

358
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,035
- I'm going out the window.
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:29,035
No revolution in history
has ever started

360
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:31,067
- with the words "index cards."
- Preach, Courtney.

361
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:32,915
Why did 52% of the city vote for me?

362
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,335
Because they are sick and tired

363
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,375
of hearing what phonies intend to do.

364
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,335
What did you have in mind,
she asked with a tone.

365
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:40,205
- The City Commons.
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:42,075
People really feel connected
to the place.

367
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:44,955
They remember hanging out there
back in the day like we used to.

368
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,745
I say we transform

369
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:47,995
- that hideous dump...
- Yes.

370
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,125
Into the most beautiful dump
you have ever seen.

371
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:51,665
And the best part about it...

372
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,785
We can do it right now
without spending a dime.

373
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:54,666
- Now, wait a minute.
- Uh-huh.

374
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:55,835
- Did you say right now...
- Uh-huh.

375
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:56,706
- ...without spending a dime?
- Yes, I did.

376
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:58,915
- But how?
- By doing what we do,

377
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,785
throwing the party of the millennium!

378
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:02,915
Beer, barbecue, brooms, buckets!

379
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,495
- Turn up and clean up.
- Boom.

380
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:07,875
Okay, Courtney, I love a party
just as much as the next guy,

381
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:09,285
but there's a process.

382
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,916
- You need a permit. You need the...
- So we'll get a permit.

383
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,575
And we can round up people in hours.

384
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:13,955
I mean, Jermaine, how long did it take

385
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:15,625
to gather people for my "Red Sky" video?

386
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,254
- Less than a month.
- Took us a day.

387
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,794
Well, we had to wait
for Wild Man to get here.

388
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:19,705
Oh, you remember Wild Man?

389
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:20,706
- Right.
- Okay, Wild Man. Okay.

390
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:21,706
- Look, trust me.
- Forgot about him.

391
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:23,875
- Once we pull this off,
- Wild man.

392
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:26,455
the voters will only have
one question...

393
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:28,075
"Why'd it take 25 years?"

394
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:29,835
- Oh. Wow.
- Come on. Did y'all feel that?

395
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:31,745
- Did y'all feel that?
- Write a book.

396
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:56,336
What's up, Fort Grey, Californ-i-a?!

397
00:13:57,576 --> 00:14:00,285
I just want to thank you all for
proving my long-held conviction

398
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:03,705
that anything is possible if you
load people up on cheap beer.

399
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:04,666
Yes.

400
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:05,705
Courtney.

401
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,382
But, seriously, after this,
if you all could please

402
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:09,344
- come back to my apartment.
- Okay, maybe go up there.

403
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:10,995
- Yeah. Okay, okay.
- My closet is a disaster.

404
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:12,705
Okay, baby, give me the thing.

405
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:15,165
Hey! Is he a bundle from heaven or what?

406
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,304
Thank you for helping us
at City Commons,

407
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:18,464
but there's still work to do,

408
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,391
so I need you to pick up trash
and not just get trashed, huh?

409
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,125
- Mr. Mayor-elect?
- All right!

410
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,835
I'm afraid to even ask, but you
did remember the permit, right?

411
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:26,336
Classic.

412
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:27,565
Oh, sh...

413
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,935
Great.

414
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,975
Oh, I knew I forgot something,

415
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:32,396
- and that something...
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,065
...is my permit-having victory dance!

417
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,066
Like, what?

418
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,265
Okay. All right.

419
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:39,396
Love it.

420
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:40,525
I'm almost impressed.

421
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,265
I could bust the worm
if I had more space.

422
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,816
I could do backflips.

423
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,645
- Yo, man, I feel so fulfilled.
- Yeah.

424
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:47,629
It's kind of like we're both the mayor,

425
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,605
- you know?
- Hello.

426
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:52,525
Yeah, man. Um...

427
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:53,855
Like, for real?

428
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:55,895
No, no. No, no, no, no.

429
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,645
Um, uh, let... let me...
let me call you right back.

430
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:01,646
- Wrong number?
- That was the booker from The 8:30 Club.

431
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,025
Their opener canceled,
and they thought about,

432
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:04,605
"How about the mayor kid?"

433
00:15:04,606 --> 00:15:06,065
Brah, guess who's headlining.

434
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,605
- Who?
- Mac Etcetera.

435
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,568
Ah!

436
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:12,935
- When is it?!
- Uh, it's happening in about...

437
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:14,395
eight minutes.

438
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,765
I would be insane not to go, right?

439
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,525
I mean, the second hand
is moving crazy fast.

440
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:20,315
No, no, no, Courtney, look, if I
was you, here's what I would do.

441
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:23,935
I would ask me, and I, you,
would tell you, me, don't go.

442
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:24,975
Oh, so you're conflicted, too.

443
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:27,265
Courtney, l-look.
Look at this party, man.

444
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:28,855
There's still work to do, man,

445
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,145
and you made a commitment
to all these people.

446
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,688

457

I want y'all to make some noise

458
00:15:56,717 --> 00:15:59,500
for the next mayor of Fort Grey,
California, Courtney Rose.

We've received several noise complaints,

00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:19,196
and I'm gonna need to see
a public-assembly permit.

463
00:16:19,197 --> 00:16:21,616
You are in luck because
we have one of those.

Where's Courtney?

465
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:24,736
That is something I'm also wondering

466
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:27,696
because I don't know where Courtney is.

- Hey!

470
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,466
Officer, why don't you
give me your phone number,

471
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:39,796
and maybe I can just text you

472
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:41,506
a picture of the permit later tonight?

473
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,546
That didn't sound like
a solicitation, did it?

474
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,296
I'm not giving you my phone number.

475
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,716
Party's over, folks.
Vacate the premises.

476
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:49,177
Go home.

477
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,876
- All right, let's go.
- Oh! Don't touch me!

478
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,216
I am a mail woman.

479
00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:54,136
Do you want your Christmas cards
showing up in March?

480
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:57,796
If I have to say it again,
citations will be issued.

481
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,466
Citations? Oh, I'll take a citation

482
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:00,966
if you can tell me one person up in here

483
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:01,967
that knows what a citation is.

484
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:02,967
- You don't even know what a...
- Dina.

485
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:04,716
I got this... what a citation is.

486
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,006
I know what an arrest is.

487
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:08,337
Arrest? I'd like to see you try.

488
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:13,256
The prison industrial complex.

489
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:15,216
If I come out of here a killer,
that's on you.

490
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,136
Thank you all so much right now!

491
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,586
Thank you to Mac Etcetera!

492
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:21,046
You just made a childhood dream
come true.

493
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:23,466
I just hope the clink
didn't break your spirit.

494
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,176
I'm here, I'm here!

495
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,006
I got your message, Ma.

496
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:28,926
Guys, look, can I...

497
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:30,176
- can I just say real quick...
- You know what you can say?

498
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:32,676
You can say nothing.
That's what you can say.

499
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,756
You basically handcuffed
and arrested your own mother.

500
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:36,966
Our mother.

501
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,676
And you wonder why
she likes me more than you.

502
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:40,466
- No, T.K.
- Well, agree to disagree.

503
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,676
Look, we put our reputations
on the line for you, Courtney,

504
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,426
a-and I barely have one as it is.

505
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:46,336
You know what? I'm out. I'm done.

506
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:47,427
Goodbye.

507
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:51,216
- I don't have a ride.
- Mm-hmm.

508
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,796
Fool, come on.

509
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:54,466
You know, Courtney?

510
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:57,256
I feel bad for the 52% of
the people who voted for you

511
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:59,546
because you just made a fool
out of all of them.

512
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,006
Hopeless.

513
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:06,546
I'm sorry, Ma. I am so embarrassed.

514
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:08,876
Courtney, I am your mother.

515
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:12,506
I have been your mother
since I was 16 years old.

516
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:15,426
And no matter what penitentiary
you send me to,

517
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,876
you are my son, and I'll believe in you.

518
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:19,796
But, unfortunately,

519
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,926
everyone else in the world
ain't your mama.

520
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,426
I know. I-I wish they had
locked me up instead of you.

521
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:25,466
Okay, well, first choice,

522
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,586
neither one of us being locked up.

523
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:28,466
Courtney, listen.

524
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:31,466
This is not about you anymore.

525
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:36,756
Your actions have consequences
for a lot of people, our people.

526
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:41,676
Your failures are their failures.

527
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:44,508
Okay. I know what I have to do.

528
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,466
Okay.

529
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,705
Do you want to say it first,
or you want me to say it

530
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,113
- just to make sure we're on the same page?
- Are you kidding me right now?!

531
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:52,676
Okay, we'll... we'll
compare notes later.

532
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:53,926
That's fine.

533
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,587
<i>Hi. You've reached Courtney Rose.</i>

534
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,006
<i>♪ ThePeoplesCourtney. Leave a message.</i>

535
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,796
Voicemail. Where's Courtney?

536
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:03,716
What? What, guys?

537
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,876
What's so important that you
couldn't tell me over the phone?

538
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:09,466
- Um...
- Courtney is no longer with us.

539
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:12,006
Okay, that was a weird way
to phrase that.

540
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,926
I mean we can't find him.

541
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:16,256
Indifference with subtle notes
of disdain.

542
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:17,296
Yeah, I see that.

543
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:19,006
I'm not joining your search party,

544
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,836
and this isn't one of those situations

545
00:19:20,837 --> 00:19:23,157
where I say one thing
and then I eventually cave.

546
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:25,427
I'm serious.

547
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:27,967
Stop looking at me.

548
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,370
Okay, let's go find him.

549
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,426
- All right.
- Thank you.

550
00:19:32,427 --> 00:19:34,506
- Val, we checked everywhere.
- Did you check the commons?

551
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,867
Okay, we did not check everywhere.

552
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:38,942
It all looks amazing.

553
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,086
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

554
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:41,506
Look at this place.

555
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:42,836
There's my man!

556
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:44,136
I can't believe he finished this.

557
00:19:44,137 --> 00:19:46,411
Man, this is the most beautiful
dump I have ever seen.

558
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,756
Hey, guys.

559
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:49,796
I figured I had
some unfinished business,

560
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:52,586
so I, uh, put in a couple extra hours.

561
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:55,334
We were just worried about you,
man, and... and angry with you.

562
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,608
It was very complicated.

563
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,682
- I mean, this rich emotional stew.
- Yeah.

564
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:00,323
Sorry. I'm sorry, guys.

565
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,953
I turned my phone off
so I could avoid distractions.

566
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,613
Oh, I could never turn off my phone.

567
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,534
- What?
- What? I-I get Internet on this thing.

568
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:08,243
I ain't never had an Internet phone.

569
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:10,203
You know, you didn't have to do
all this by yourself, Courtney.

570
00:20:10,204 --> 00:20:11,913
You could've called me.
I mean, I had stuff.

571
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:13,310
And I wouldn't have been there,
but Val...

572
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:16,283
No, no, no, no. I needed to do
all of this all by my lonesome.

573
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:18,153
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

574
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:19,312
Court, I think we're close.

575
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:20,244
- Hmm.
- No.

576
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:21,743
I can do the rest
if you want to take off.

577
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,033
There is a tiny man behind you.

578
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:24,153
Yeah, I don't know who that is.

579
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:25,653
- I'm telling your mama.
- Come on.

580
00:20:25,654 --> 00:20:29,243
You are a lot of things, Courtney Rose.

581
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:31,033
But you're not hopeless.

582
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:33,653
I see a lot of hope in this junkyard...

583
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:36,363
and a clear violation
of child-labor laws.

584
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:37,863
Come on, we got to get you some sleep.

585
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:40,203
It might be your last chance
for the next four years.

586
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:42,153
Wait. This job is four years?

587
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:43,653
- Yeah.
- I thought it was ju...

588
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:45,703
- Come on.
- Nah, it's okay.

589
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,722
Music can wait, right?
I got a job to do.

590
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:57,033
Courtney Rose,
is this what I think it is?

591
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,203
Mm-hmm. If you think
that is an index card,

592
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:01,033
then, yeah, sure,
that's exactly what it is.

593
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:03,283
Someone is planning
their first 100 days.

594
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:05,323
That's how I roll.

595
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:06,953
- All right.
- Aw, nah.

596
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,324
- Come on. Let me see.
- Okay.

597
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:15,653
That's actually really impressive.

598
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:17,073
- Right?
- I'm really glad you said that.

599
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,823
Because when I'm in my creative process,

600
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:19,863
I go to a really dark place.

601
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:21,283
- And so to see that...
- Well...

602
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,364
It looks like Fort Grey is
in some pretty good hands.
