1
00:00:01,844 --> 00:00:04,113
My name is H.G. Wells.

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:06,522
My friend John is Jack the Ripper.

3
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,981
He's escaped from 1893
in my time machine,

4
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:10,983
and I am the only one who can catch him.

5
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,562
I know things about you

6
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:15,445
that you don't even know about yourself.

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,656
Like the fact that you
have a son. In Paris.

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,625
- Henry Ayers.
- Impossible.

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,400
You asked me if I believe in fate.

10
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:23,824
Oh, I believe very much so

11
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:25,970
that this moment was destined to happen.

12
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:27,928
I understand you went
to my childhood home.

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,697
We did overhear your
father talk about his work.

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,131
Project Utopia?

15
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't know of any Project Utopia.

16
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,968
Griffin, your sister's here.

17
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,569
Brooke. What in the
hell are you doing here?

18
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,972
John escaped.

19
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:40,792
What happened? You were
supposed to keep him locked up.

20
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:42,854
I know you.

21
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,424
Good Lord. What are you looking at?

22
00:00:57,426 --> 00:01:00,059
This is actual footage from World War I.

23
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,861
It's man versus machine.

24
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,431
It's not war. It's slaughter.

25
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,937
Why would John go to such a time?

26
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:11,047
What was so important in
Paris on March 30, 1918?

27
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,538
Could you open up that map again?

28
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,773
All we know so far

29
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,109
is that he landed at
Bois De Boulogne Park.

30
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:19,202
And he could have gone
anywhere from there.

31
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:20,929
Be impossible to find.

32
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,916
What was happening on that day?

33
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,723
It was toward the end of World War I.

34
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,421
The Germans had a new artillery weapon

35
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:33,879
called the Paris Gun.

36
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:35,013
They hid it in the countryside

37
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:36,814
and fired it into the city at random.

38
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:37,915
Despicable.

39
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:39,817
Innocent people struck
down at any moment.

40
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,953
You said John spent a year
in Paris at medical school?

41
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:44,755
Yes, but that was
years earlier, in 1890.

42
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,617
Did he have any friends or family there?

43
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:48,092
Not that I recall.

44
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:51,438
Except, no, there was a...
there was an English woman

45
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:52,543
who worked at the medical school.

46
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:54,558
Uh... Oh, what's her name?

47
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,433
Pauline. Pauline Ayers.

48
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:57,634
He boasted that they were lovers,

49
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:59,534
but then it ended when
he went back to London.

50
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,137
That's something.

51
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:08,184
What's this?

52
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,880
It's her genealogy.

53
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,982
Pauline was only in Paris a few years,

54
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,910
moved back to England,

55
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,577
worked at a hospital in Stockport,

56
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,768
died in 1914 of Spanish Flu.

57
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,818
Pauline had a son born in 1891.

58
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,992
Henry Ayers. Mother, Pauline.

59
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,515
Father...

60
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:29,133
John Stevenson.

61
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,688
Whoa.

62
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:32,586
Impossible. John never spoke of a son.

63
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,121
Maybe he didn't know.

64
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:36,235
But a-a woman would
tell a man such a thing.

65
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,625
So she had her reasons.

66
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:40,100
She easily could have kept it from him.

67
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:42,139
So how did he find out?

68
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,711
You can find anything
on the Internet today.

69
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:48,902
Henry Ayers.

70
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:51,162
He was a doctor in the
Royal Army Medical Corps,

71
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:52,452
9th Battalion.

72
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:55,345
He was stationed in Paris,
killed in action on...

73
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:58,131
March 30, 1918.

74
00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:00,748
That's it, then.

75
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:03,459
John's gone back to Paris
to save his son's life.

77
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,477
I found some coats for Jane

78
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,345
and some currency for you to take.

79
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,683
Ah, excellent. Thank you.

80
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,566
- You're welcome.
- How's Griffin?

81
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:13,993
Oh, John did a number on him,
but he's with the doctor now.

82
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:15,218
He'll be fine.

83
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:16,784
Do you know where you're going, exactly?

84
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:18,510
Uh, Captain Henry Ayers was stationed

85
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,307
at the RAC field office in Paris.

86
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:23,308
He was part of the deployment from
Paris to Saint Quentin in the north.

87
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,112
At 11:00 a.m. March 30th,

88
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:27,971
the motorized transport
carrying Henry got underway.

89
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:29,239
Shortly after,

90
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,974
it was destroyed by German
artillery bombardment

91
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,575
just outside the city limits.

92
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:33,735
All men were lost.

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,142
John will try to stop Henry
from getting on that transport.

94
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,647
That's what we have to prevent.

95
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,508
You're gonna stop a
man from saving his son?

96
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,385
As cruel as it sounds,
if his son survives,

97
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:44,053
there's no foretelling
the damage it would cause.

98
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,421
H.G. is right.

99
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,723
The time ripples it could
cause would be devastating.

100
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:49,258
I will find him and bring him back.

101
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,760
John must pay for his
actions in this world,

102
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:52,535
and I will see to it.

103
00:04:52,964 --> 00:04:55,230
Uh, Vanessa, did you discover

104
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:56,532
anything more about Project Utopia?

105
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:58,334
No, I've been through
my parents' papers,

106
00:04:58,336 --> 00:04:59,368
the corporate archives.

107
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,637
There's no mention of it.

108
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,704
But I reached out to a
colleague of my father's.

109
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:03,973
I'm gonna go see him.

110
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:05,535
He was the head of
research in the early years,

111
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,277
so he may know something.

112
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:10,214
Do you think I could get
away with this in Paris?

113
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,705
Uh, you're not going.

114
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:15,859
Trust me, you'll want me there.

115
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:17,919
Je parle Français. I
spent a semester there.

116
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,120
I know the city inside-out.

117
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:20,689
But 1918 is a time of war.

118
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:21,990
Which is exactly why you need me.

119
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:23,100
No, it's too dangerous.

120
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,571
What kind of man would I be
if I put a woman in such peril?

121
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:27,061
This woman can handle herself.

122
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:28,327
She's proven it more than once.

123
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:30,897
I'm well aware, but at
the risk of sounding...

124
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:32,603
Like a sexist pig?

125
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,747
I've yet to oink, so I fail to
understand the "pig" reference,

126
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:39,440
but what I was going to say is
that as a man out of his time...

127
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,909
I went to the '80s.
That wasn't a problem.

128
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:44,308
I simply must say no. That's final.

129
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:48,449
Now, Martin, we can't risk

130
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,217
further destabilization
of the fourth dimension.

131
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,085
You'll sync the time
machine to John's first jump

132
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:53,320
and send me back in real time?

133
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:54,588
You got it.

134
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,423
John landed in Paris at 6:00 a.m.

135
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:58,759
Exactly 2 hours and 17
minutes have passed since then.

136
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:00,761
Therefore, I will arrive at 8:17

137
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:03,163
and have approximately
three hours to stop him.

138
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:04,524
Will that be enough time?

139
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:06,866
Henry's flat was just down the
street from the RAC hospital.

140
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,386
My hope is that he
didn't venture too far

141
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,399
in the hours before his deployment.

142
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:11,993
Jane.

143
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,162
Good luck.

144
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:20,662
I can't risk her life.

145
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,416
She will realize that.

146
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:26,926
Here, I was able to
track this down for you.

147
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,154
What is this for?

148
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:29,656
Protection.

149
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:32,191
It's a 1915 semiautomatic, fully loaded.

150
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,293
I am not comfortable taking a gun.

151
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,695
Violence is not the option.

152
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:37,797
Well, then, use this to prevent it.

153
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,008
Against all better judgment.

154
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,297
Wait.

155
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:45,412
When do you want me to send
the machine back for you?

156
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,290
12:00 noon. By then, I will
have accomplished my mission...

157
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:50,946
or failed miserably,
and all will be lost.

158
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:13,018

159
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,206

_

163
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:26,911
Londoner.

164
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:29,190
Is my accent that dreadful?

165
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,515
I was just down at the Army hospital,

166
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,217
and they said this is
where many of the doctors

167
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,418
come after their shifts.

168
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,987
Not for very much longer.

169
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,221
The Brits are moving north

170
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,575
to fight the Germans at Saint Quentin.

171
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:42,126
You don't happen to know a doctor

172
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,325
by the name of Henry Ayers, do you?

173
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:47,297
I'm an old friend.

174
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:50,504
I was hoping to bump into
him before he left Paris.

175
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,769
Henry Ayers, huh?

176
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,770
You're friends with that scoundrel?

177
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,040
So I take it he's a bit sinister, yeah?

178
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,806
Oh, I could tell you some stories.

179
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:00,063
Margot!

180
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,339
Henry, my love!

181
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:05,964
- How about one last drink for the road?
- Ohh!

182
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,981
Ohh!

183
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:11,098
Careful, he'll sucker you
into paying for the round.

184
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,442
I'm Margot, by the way.

185
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,501
I am this lucky bloke's fiancée.

186
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:17,020
Henry Ayers. Pleased to meet you.

187
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,815
John.

188
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,598
Well, don't be rude. You
don't recognize your friend?

189
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,999
It's quite all right.

190
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:26,407
I am cursed with a familiar face.

191
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,330
And I'm cursed to never forget them.

192
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:32,110
Are you sure we've met?

193
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:35,343
In all truth, no. No, we've not met.

194
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:36,580
But I've come to find you

195
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:39,382
because I used to know
your mother, Pauline Ayers.

196
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:44,319
I'll be damned.

197
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,908
He actually went to see his son.

198
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:50,018
You knew he'd go to 1918 Paris?

199
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:52,609
I knew he had a son in
Paris who dies in 1918.

200
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,462
I didn't think he'd actually go.

201
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,813
Why would John care about having a son?

202
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:59,211
He's a psychopathic narcissist.

203
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:01,469
Something was created in his image.

204
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,588
- His ego...
- Ow!

205
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:06,852
- ... must seek it out.
- Ow! That hurts.

206
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:08,776
You should have won the fight.

207
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:11,112
He had a knife. He didn't play fair.

208
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,276
What are you doing?

209
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,226
This treatment is more
effective on a fresh wound.

210
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:16,818
What treatment? Aah, Brooke, come on!

211
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,838
You... you could have numbed me.

212
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:21,697
I could have.

213
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,275
Dermis tissue.

214
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:32,366
Lab-grown from stem cells.

215
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:51,486
What the hell?

216
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,899
This is Dad's research.

217
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:57,490
A basic version of it, yes.

218
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:59,992
The injection activates
the transfer of genetic code

219
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:03,195
from the surrounding skin cells
to the undifferentiated tissue.

220
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:05,030
We could have used this in Iraq.

221
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:06,332
Well, pretty soon,

222
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:08,534
every soldier will be
carrying it in their pocket.

223
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:11,501
So if that's the basic version,

224
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:13,204
what else are you doing
with Dad's research?

225
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:14,840
Well, look at that.

226
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:16,833
Griffin's interested in
something other than himself.

227
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:18,283
No, I'm serious.

228
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:20,189
What's going on down here?

229
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,375
Would you like to meet
one of my patients?

230
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:33,479
Nick, this is my brother, Griffin.

231
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:35,294
You don't mind showing
off for him, do you?

232
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:36,596
Not at all.

233
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:42,768
Does that measure his grip strength?

234
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,357
Yep.

235
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,394
Whenever you're ready.

236
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:10,060
That's impossible.

237
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:12,029
I've developed an enhancement drug

238
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,117
from his own genetic makeup.

239
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:16,434
That number can't be right.

240
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,898
900 pounds means he has...

241
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,737
... The strength of six men.

242
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,754
And his heart isn't even up to 150.

243
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,928
- Thank you, Nick.
- Anytime, Brooke.

244
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,825
I'll be right back.

245
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:40,400
Is this even legal, what you're doing...

246
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:41,791
experimenting on humans?

247
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:43,960
Clinical trials. Completely
legal and contracted.

248
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,663
This better be on the
up-and-up, not like what Dad did.

249
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,970
This could be bad for us.

250
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:50,454
You mean bad for you and
your political career?

251
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:54,191
What's going on with Project Utopia?

252
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:56,705
Vanessa's looking into it.

253
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:58,253
So far, nothing.

254
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:00,446
Make sure it stays that way.

255
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,354
Are we doing the right thing here?

256
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:05,015
There's still time to stop it all.

257
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,048
If Vanessa finds out I'm involved...

258
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,970
I know you care about Vanessa.

259
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:11,219
You spent all this time
getting close to her.

260
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:12,814
It's only natural.

261
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:15,491
But her family destroyed ours.

262
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:18,560
We lost everything.

263
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:20,759
Don't forget that.

264
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,299
It's our turn now.

265
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:31,625
My mother moved back to Stockport

266
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:33,141
right before I was born.

267
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:34,609
Did you work with her at the hospital?

268
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:38,192
I was doing my residency then,
and Pauline was kind to me.

269
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,382
She spoke so highly of you.

270
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,584
I was at the hospital earlier
and saw your name on a chart.

271
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:45,286
Thought I'd look you up.

272
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:48,713
I'm so sorry to hear of her passing.

273
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:51,283
At least she was spared
the sight of this war.

274
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,674
She loved Paris.

275
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,297
It would have destroyed
her to see it this way.

276
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,486
Hmm. Yes.

277
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:01,297
And this is where she met your father.

278
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,836
She spoke about my father?

279
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,371
A bit, yes.

280
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:07,400
So you know he abandoned
her without a second thought.

281
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:09,810
She gave up on Paris

282
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:12,268
so my grandparents
could help her raise me.

283
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,849
Now here I am, defending it in war.

284
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:18,814
Yes, the number of men killed is...

285
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,329
unfathomable.

286
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:26,572
The past several months have
been... particularly bloody.

287
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:30,689
But still, the mind
finds ways through it.

288
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:35,234
It's a strange thing to
take a life, isn't it?

289
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:38,938
My calling is to save
lives, not take them.

290
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,596
Yes, but I imagine the...

291
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,766
lines are often blurred.

292
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,993
I can assure you they're not.

293
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:52,217
Well, it's impressive

294
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:56,421
to experience darkness
and not be consumed by it.

295
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,124
Well, we don't have much choice, do we?

296
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:03,705
We either reject the darkness
or we let it destroy us.

297
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:09,367
Another round?

298
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,078
Please.

299
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:13,264
- Two more, please.
- Make it three.

300
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:14,772
What do you say?

301
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:26,793
I thought you'd show
your face sooner or later.

302
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:28,618
So, Paris at war.

303
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,444
Quite a sight, eh?

304
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,153
It's an inconceivable tragedy.

305
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:33,530
Oh, lighten up.

306
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:35,154
Paris survives.

307
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,750
The world marches on.
We saw it ourselves.

308
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:40,149
And we saw the scars
that were left behind.

309
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:42,117
These conflicts happen again and again.

310
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,453
Each time, the killing
easier than before.

311
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,664
You're so dramatic.

312
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:48,457
War can never be truly stopped.

313
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,359
Once you unleash a
beast of this magnitude,

314
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:52,568
there's no way to call it off.

315
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:56,165
Perhaps one day, we shall
annihilate each other.

316
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,881
We'll call it "The War of the Worlds."

317
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,235
I see fatherhood hasn't granted you

318
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,477
a more benevolent view of humanity.

319
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,071
Hmm.

320
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:07,914
Yes, Henry.

321
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:11,569
I don't approve of the name,
but a decent lad, nonetheless.

322
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:13,257
Who'd have thought?

323
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,422
The conclusion is obvious.

324
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:16,793
Leave him alone.

325
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:17,794
Let him stay that way.

326
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:18,862
I'm doing a heroic thing here.

327
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:19,963
His death is tragic,

328
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:22,256
but the fact remains
you can't change history.

329
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:24,641
Is that a guideline, or will the
world fall apart in front of our eyes?

330
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,298
Quite possibly.

331
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:28,306
So I'm supposed to let my son die?

332
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:29,763
Is that it?

333
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:31,441
Unfortunately, yes.

334
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:33,367
Because that is how history records it.

335
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,680
Doesn't the Utopian philosophy

336
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:37,248
require us to use our
knowledge to save his life?

337
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,815
It's not our choice.

338
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:41,131
Saving Henry could
cost countless others.

339
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:43,487
Sounds like a grand adventure to me.

340
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,275
Is that why you're doing this?

341
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,680
Thrills?

342
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:49,219
Do you even care about Henry at all?

343
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:52,200
Maybe that's what I'm
trying to discover.

344
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,598
You're a complicated man, John.

345
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,766
I'll grant you that.

346
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,867
And I am sorry about your
son, but you can't interfere.

347
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,359
Another drink?

348
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,734
- Hey, there.
- How are you feeling?

349
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,112
All bandaged up and cleared for combat.

350
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:35,702
Thanks. Have you seen Vanessa?

351
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,561
Uh, she went to go speak with some guy

352
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,460
who used to work for her father.

353
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:42,004
About Project Utopia?

354
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,410
She's on her cell if you need her.

355
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:48,004
No, it-it can wait.

356
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:50,488
What's all this?

357
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:52,809
There were photographers and journalists

358
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,481
all over Paris during the war,

359
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:57,580
and these are from an archive
at the national museum.

360
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:58,682
Wow. Incredible.

361
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,650
How do you have access to this stuff?

362
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,449
My job gives me access.

363
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:03,941
What is it you do?

364
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,466
I'm an assistant curator
at the Space Museum,

365
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:08,551
Or I am until I get fired,

366
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:12,209
which could be any day now
if I keep calling in sick.

367
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:13,598
Ah.

368
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:15,991
So, um, what are you looking for?

369
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:18,081
I requested all the
images for March 30th

370
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:19,856
thinking maybe I could
give us some information

371
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:21,247
that would help us in 1918,

372
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:23,526
but all that is pointless,

373
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:26,652
given that I'm here and not in Paris.

374
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,051
Yeah.

375
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,120
Um, World War I was a dangerous time.

376
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:36,918
I wouldn't put a woman I cared
about in danger like that.

377
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,535
Am I the only one here that's
living in the 21st century?

378
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:44,713
No one wants to put
someone they love in danger.

379
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:49,020
I wouldn't say H.G. loves me.

380
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:50,512
Well, I've seen you two together.

381
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,949
If it's not love, it's
certainly getting there.

382
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:56,811
Uh, but I do feel for you.

383
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,748
Gonna be tough when he finally

384
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,073
takes his time machine and heads home.

385
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:04,967
Yeah.

386
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,925
I guess it will be.

387
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:16,909
It's time.

388
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,784
I don't want you to go.

389
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:21,323
I must.

390
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,646
But I'll be back soon.

391
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,338
Do you promise?

392
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,354
Yeah, good lad!

393
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,823
You'll never convince Henry
to dessert his comrades.

394
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:38,183
Then I'll have to use
other means to stop him.

395
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:40,509
Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen,

396
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:42,494
but I'm afraid I must take my leave.

397
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,395
When this is all over, I'll
look you up in Stockport.

398
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:46,722
We'll raise a glass to my mother.

399
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,446
I'd like that very much, Henry.

400
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,300
I'm sorry to see you go.

401
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:52,135
Say a prayer for peace.

402
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:56,042
Peace... and long life.

403
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:05,632
Well...

404
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,828
always a pleasure, H.G.

405
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:10,486
Stay seated, John.

406
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:15,792
I do believe this moment feels familiar.

407
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:17,959
Albeit reversed.

408
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,464
Aren't you worried people will see?

409
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:22,146
I will shoot you in
the leg and carry you

410
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,595
back to the time machine if I have to.

411
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,944
You have it all thought out, don't you?

412
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,715
I can't let you save your son, John.

413
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:31,409
And you can't stop me.

414
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:35,254
John!

415
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,112
Not in my café!

416
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,681
He's a bloody spy. I heard him talking.

417
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:40,723
He said the Germans
were up to something...

418
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,684
No, no, you've got this
wrong. I must stop this man.

419
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:45,020
Drop the gun before I kill you.

420
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:48,360
I'll go get help.

421
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:49,751
_

422
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:52,774
You have it wrong!

423
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,340
One more word, and you're dead.

424
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,606
- You must listen to me.
- You're not going anywhere.

425
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:04,863
I would explain everything,

426
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:06,459
but Henry's transport
is leaving in moments.

427
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:07,817
What does Henry have to do with this?

428
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:09,982
John has gone to pull him
off the Army transport.

429
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:12,379
- Why? Is he in danger?
- There's no time to explain.

430
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:14,169
You have to take my word for it.

431
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,365
_

432
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,295
_

433
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:27,474
Vanessa Anders all grown up.

434
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:29,341
My goodness.

435
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:31,506
I remember when you would

436
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,348
come visit your father at the lab.

437
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:36,740
I remember, too.

438
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:38,843
I loved those visits.

439
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:41,289
I think of your father often.

440
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:44,414
Your parents' death was such a tragedy.

441
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,316
So much important work left undone.

442
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:49,318
Well, that work is why
I'm here, Dr. Meyers.

443
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,419
I've recently come across

444
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:52,509
a project my father was working on...

445
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:53,956
Utopia.

446
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,392
Do you remember it?

447
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:58,691
Oh, Utopia. Um...

448
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:01,517
no, not sure that rings a bell.

449
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,475
It was 1980.

450
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,533
My father had just
patented his breakthrough.

451
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:06,801
You were his right-hand man.

452
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:08,737
You knew everything going on in the lab.

453
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:11,706
It was such a long time ago, Vanessa.

454
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,793
Sometimes, the past
should stay the past.

455
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:16,262
Dr. Meyers, please.

456
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:19,518
This is extremely important.

457
00:21:19,543 --> 00:21:21,403
What can you tell me?

458
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:25,674
I-I just don't want you to be
disappointed in your father,

459
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:26,864
to think less of him.

460
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:28,596
Why would I think less of him?

461
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:34,496
David was a brilliant scientist,

462
00:21:34,498 --> 00:21:36,798
but he was young, impatient.

463
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:38,532
Some of the medications he patented...

464
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:41,885
they saved the company
from financial ruin,

465
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:45,565
but he didn't do the original research.

466
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:47,799
Did he steal the research?

467
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,268
He never admitted it,

468
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,445
but I did suspect.

469
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:56,369
There was no name on the
files other than "Utopia."

470
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,019
And after your parents were killed,

471
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:01,205
the original hard copies vanished.

472
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,290
Well, there must be something left.

473
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:07,204
I still have everything
I brought from...

474
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,948
from the lab when I retired.

475
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:14,448
But such a long time ago, Vanessa.

476
00:22:14,987 --> 00:22:17,915
It's... it's unlikely, I'm afraid,

477
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,307
that I have anything that can help you,

478
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,313
but, uh, I'll look.

479
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:28,180
- Thank you.
- All right.

480
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,285
Excuse me.

481
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:45,850
Excuse me. Henry Ayers?

482
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,142
Henry Ayers. That way? Thank you.

483
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,139
I'll get right to it.

484
00:22:55,928 --> 00:22:58,010
Henry! Henry.

485
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:00,254
John. You shouldn't be here.

486
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,869
Listen to me. It's
vitally important we speak.

487
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:03,217
- I only need a moment.
- Pardon me, sir.

488
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:04,459
I don't think you understand.

489
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,943
I'm deploying to war.

490
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:08,295
One, sir.

491
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:14,529
I have urgent news from your father.

492
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:18,834
That's impossible.

493
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,154
My father doesn't even know I was born.

494
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,436
I swear on my life he does.

495
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,685
He sent me to find you.

496
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:29,453
You worked with my mother.
How do you know my father?

497
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:32,459
Just... come with me for a moment.

498
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:33,749
- I'll tell you everything.
- Allons-y!

499
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:35,154
All right, men, let's move out!

500
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:44,853
What's so important my father
couldn't say it to me himself?

501
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:47,546
Your transport is going to be ambushed.

502
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:50,006
You and your men will be dead
before you even make it to the front.

503
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:52,104
You're mad. Where did
you get this information?

504
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:53,658
I can't say,

505
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,418
but your father sent
me here to help you.

506
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:58,057
That is the most
unbelievable part of all.

507
00:23:58,252 --> 00:24:00,986
My father is a vile prat
who only cares for himself.

508
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:02,682
Why would he help me?

509
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:07,782
Because you're nothing like him.

510
00:24:08,302 --> 00:24:10,118
I should hope not.

511
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:27,646
Hey, you. Busy day?

512
00:24:27,671 --> 00:24:30,006
More like one of those days
where nothing is going right.

513
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:31,560
Mm, how can I help?

514
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:32,661
You could keep doing what you're doing

515
00:24:32,686 --> 00:24:34,240
for a few more seconds.

516
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,632
Oh, hold on.

517
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:38,170
Things might be getting a little better.

518
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:39,427
Okay.

519
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:42,104
Dr. Meyers.

520
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:45,741
Vanessa, my late wife always
told me I was a hoarder,

521
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:48,376
but sometimes, it does come in handy.

522
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:49,711
You found something.

523
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:54,006
Some old files that I
thought had been shredded,

524
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,529
but I haven't had a chance
to go through them yet.

525
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:58,286
I'll be right there.

526
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:02,033
- Who is Dr. Meyers?
- Cedric Meyers, a scientist.

527
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:03,608
I will explain everything
when I get back.

528
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,014
- All right.
- Just keep your fingers crossed.

529
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,131
Okay.

530
00:25:17,336 --> 00:25:18,571
Hey.

531
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:21,865
Hey, so I have something on Utopia.

532
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,968
We need to find Cedric Meyers.

533
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:33,474
Help! Someone!

534
00:25:35,678 --> 00:25:37,256
It's too late.

535
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:38,922
They're all gone.

536
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:40,780
I have to get back to my men.

537
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:43,738
You don't understand
what I mean by "gone."

538
00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:45,653
Why are you doing this?

539
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,537
Clearly not for the gratitude.

540
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:50,419
You have kidnapped me against my will.

541
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:52,277
I saved you!

542
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:55,021
Your father saved you!

543
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:56,776
The man you judge,

544
00:25:56,778 --> 00:26:00,732
the man the whole world has
put on trial in absentia!

545
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:04,334
The selfish, vile prat. The Ripper!

546
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,253
You know him so well,
yet beg to know why.

547
00:26:08,255 --> 00:26:10,856
Why? Why?!

548
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,911
He's lived a dark and dishonorable life.

549
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,317
He's done despicable things.

550
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:25,437
But that does not preclude

551
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,946
the possibility of good, does it, hmm?

552
00:26:29,844 --> 00:26:32,777
My boy. My boy.

553
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:34,727
Congratulations.

554
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:39,077
You are the proof...

555
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:42,671
the one good thing he might ever do.

556
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:47,821
The punctuation of a remarkable,

557
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,681
misunderstood life.

558
00:26:52,355 --> 00:26:54,054
You're a madman.

559
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,795
I do... I do believe you're right.

560
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,772
Untie me.

561
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:06,881
At once.

562
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:27,652
Are you with the 9th battalion?

563
00:27:28,238 --> 00:27:29,550
There's been an attack, sir.

564
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:31,934
German artillery hit the convoy
on the outskirts of the city.

565
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:33,933
There have been heavy losses.

566
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:39,711
Sir, do you know, was everyone
present and accounted for?

567
00:27:45,216 --> 00:27:46,650
Yes.

568
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:48,767
Yes.

569
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:51,392
P-Please, I...

570
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:53,368
I need a moment.

571
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:57,158
- Let's go and search the tents.
- Yes, sir.

572
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,962
You son of a bitch.

573
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:02,196
Most men respond favorably
when someone saves their life.

574
00:28:02,198 --> 00:28:04,470
I was supposed to be on that truck.

575
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:06,294
How did you know?

576
00:28:07,682 --> 00:28:10,623
Henry, there's so much
I want to tell you.

577
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,573
We'll leave this place,
and I'll explain everything.

578
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,177
I promise I will.

579
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:23,784
Take this second chance,

580
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,654
and go be with Margot.

581
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,157
Stay away from us.

582
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:37,594
Don't let me see your face again.

583
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:45,422
1918. I have to go back now.

584
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:46,906
This is Henry Ayers

585
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:48,741
on the same day he supposedly died

586
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:50,743
when his convoy was
attacked outside the city.

587
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:53,113
The records were wrong.
He was never on that truck.

588
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:54,632
He died at a café.

589
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:56,749
H.G.'s looking for
him in the wrong place.

590
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:59,385
We should be looking at Café L'Automne.

591
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,507
Here it is. March 30, 1918.

592
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:10,663
"An unidentified army medic," our Henry,

593
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,766
"died trying to rescue people

594
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,297
"after the café was
hit by the Paris Gun."

595
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:16,402
There's no address.

596
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:17,446
Poor guy.

597
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:19,738
Avoided the ambush, but
ended up dead, anyway.

598
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:22,477
Jane, I-I don't think you sh...

599
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:28,815
That photo.

600
00:29:29,323 --> 00:29:32,167
That guy in the background...
can you enlarge it?

601
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:38,339
Those clothes.

602
00:29:38,364 --> 00:29:39,620
It's H.G.

603
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:42,612
Print... print the article.

604
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:48,933
H.G. wanted you to stay here, stay safe.

605
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:51,136
He doesn't get to decide
what I can and can't do.

606
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:52,972
- But if you go back...
- Are you gonna send me back,

607
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:54,892
or are you gonna let him die?

608
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:59,011
Okay. Okay.

609
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:01,839
D-Do you even know where to find Wells?

610
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:03,159
Um, the truck just left,

611
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:04,895
so I'll look for him
at the deployment yard.

612
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,319
What if you don't find him in time?

613
00:30:06,344 --> 00:30:07,707
We don't know when
that picture was taken.

614
00:30:07,732 --> 00:30:08,979
I'll find him.

615
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:28,338
Vanessa?

616
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,774
I'm sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

617
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:31,862
Ohh.

618
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,510
No! No, please!

619
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,392
No!

620
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:44,865
No. No, what are you doing?

621
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:21,975
Dr. Meyers?

622
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,484
It's Vanessa.

623
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,672
Dr. Meyers?

624
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:32,710
Hello?

625
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,507
Dr. Meyers?

626
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:49,124
Cedric?

627
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,281
Dr. Meyers.

628
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:56,823
Oh, God.

629
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:58,374
Dr. Meyers.

630
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:00,859
Dr. Meyers.

631
00:32:00,884 --> 00:32:02,917
Oh, God.

632
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:06,365
911. What is your emergency?

633
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,591
Hello. I'm at 380 Oak Street.

634
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:11,805
My friend... I think
he had a heart attack.

635
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:14,361
- Stay on the line.
- Yes, I'll stay on the line.

636
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:15,953
Okay, ma'am, help is on the way.

637
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:23,873
Hello?

638
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:27,241
Someone there?

639
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:35,459
Anybody here?

640
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:37,694
Hello?

641
00:32:58,604 --> 00:32:59,877
_

642
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,534
_

643
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,354
_

644
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:05,956
Couldn't resist Paris
in spring, either, I see.

645
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:08,643
- Let go of me.
- Lost track of H.G.?

646
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:10,423
Has he not given you the bad news?

647
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:12,258
What are you talking about?

648
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,760
I won.

649
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:15,612
The transport left without him.

650
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:18,518
I saved Henry's life.

651
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:20,900
Congratulations.

652
00:33:20,902 --> 00:33:22,956
I hope that makes you very happy.

653
00:33:24,612 --> 00:33:25,805
What's this you're holding?

654
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,354
That has nothing to do with you.

655
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:41,018
What is this?

656
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:44,398
Leave it alone, John. Please.

657
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,862
Henry dies at the café.

658
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,806
I didn't save him after all.

659
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,096
Wait. Wait!

660
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,904
There was an attack on our
convoy headed to Saint Quentin.

661
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:01,872
What did you know about it?

662
00:34:02,088 --> 00:34:04,041
I-I knew nothing. How could I?

663
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,494
Do you know what the
punishment is for treason?

664
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,844
Margot!

665
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,199
Henry.

666
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,365
You came back!

667
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,185
John pulled me off the transport.

668
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:23,993
Everyone else is dead.

669
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,342
No!

670
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,717
Henry!

671
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:03,398
Margot.

672
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,974
H.G.!

673
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:11,060
Oh, God. Oh, God, H.G.

674
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:12,355
Please be okay.

675
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,873
I tried to stop it.

676
00:35:14,744 --> 00:35:16,244
Please.

677
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,193
You need a doctor.

678
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:22,850
Jane, what are you doing here?

679
00:35:22,852 --> 00:35:24,252
I'm getting you to the time machine.

680
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:25,980
- It's coming soon, okay?
- Okay.

681
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:27,780
Come on. We have to get you out of here.

682
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:30,910
- Henry.
- It's all right. I'm here.

683
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,918
She's going to be okay.

684
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:37,698
How did you know?

685
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,137
No, Henry, don't.

686
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:48,842
- There are still people trapped inside.
- Henry!

687
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:50,035
- Henry.
- Don't!

688
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,358
Henry!

689
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:53,899
- Help!
- Get away from there!

690
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,950
This is how Henry's supposed to die.

691
00:35:56,952 --> 00:35:59,086
- Henry!
- Henry!

692
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,082
Henry!

693
00:36:08,738 --> 00:36:10,931
Henry!

694
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:12,426
No!

695
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:14,710
No!

696
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:20,632
There was nothing you could do.

697
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:24,289
It was his day to die.

698
00:36:31,553 --> 00:36:32,651
H.G.!

699
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:33,865
No!

700
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,217
H.G., wake up!

701
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:37,311
Can you help him?

702
00:36:40,988 --> 00:36:43,275
Can you help him?! Please.

703
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:45,285
Please. Please.

704
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:52,404
Not a good sign.

705
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:54,120
- Help him.
- Why would I?

706
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,377
Because you're more than a murderer.

707
00:36:55,402 --> 00:36:56,634
You're a doctor. You told me yourself.

708
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,417
Now, prove it.

709
00:36:58,442 --> 00:36:59,831
Prove it.

710
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:06,432
His eyes are dilated.

711
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:08,764
Could have brain swelling or internal
bleeding. He needs a hospital.

712
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:11,068
- Help me get him to the time machine.
- I'm not going back!

713
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:12,748
Yes. You have to.

714
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:15,295
There's nothing left
for you here. Please.

715
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:20,006
Please.

716
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:35,846
Where's the time machine?

717
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:37,601
This way.

718
00:37:53,763 --> 00:37:56,560
His blast injury resulted
in a mild hematoma,

719
00:37:56,585 --> 00:37:58,418
which obstructed blood
flow to his heart.

720
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,162
He's on blood thinners
and meds for the pain.

721
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:01,998
All he needs to do now is rest.

722
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,549
Thank you for getting him home.

723
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:16,675
Vanessa Anders, I assume.

724
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:18,840
We finally meet.

725
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,733
- Where are you putting him?
- The basement for now.

726
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,203
I saved Wells.

727
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:28,038
Isn't that worth anything?

728
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,221
Doesn't erase what you've done...

729
00:38:30,246 --> 00:38:31,774
or who you are.

730
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:34,356
I suppose not.

731
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:36,950
Well, it was nice to meet you.

732
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:39,236
I do hope to see you again.

733
00:38:48,774 --> 00:38:50,041
Jane?

734
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:52,061
Where are we?

735
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,206
2017.

736
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,631
We did it.

737
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:57,233
And what of John?

738
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,568
Vanessa has him locked up.

739
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,365
And his son, Henry?

740
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,572
He died.

741
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,912
John didn't change anything.

742
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:08,818
He did help bring you back.

743
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,012
He's locked up?

744
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:13,081
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

745
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,435
Easy.

746
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,709
We had to insert this tube in your arm.

747
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:22,180
Oh, this is a very
impressive anesthetic.

748
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:24,592
I feel very lightheaded.

749
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:25,977
Ooh.

750
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:27,930
And good.

751
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:33,063
Jane, I'm so sorry.

752
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:35,961
- It's okay.
- No, it's not. I...

753
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:38,038
I didn't wish to be an oinking pig.

754
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:41,899
A sexist oinking pig.

755
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:44,211
I'm sorry if my behavior offends you.

756
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,114
No. I'm sorry for being too pushy.

757
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:49,550
It's just I've grown very fond of you,

758
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:53,024
and the idea that you
could be hurt is unbearable.

759
00:39:54,288 --> 00:39:57,297
That's exactly why I had to go back.

760
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:59,356
I had to help you.

761
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,406
I do believe fate has
brought us together.

762
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:09,268
You're hurt. You need to rest.

763
00:40:09,293 --> 00:40:10,914
No, hurt is what I'll be

764
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:13,540
when I'm forced to say goodbye to you.

765
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,469
You're not going anywhere
right now but to sleep.

766
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:19,532
But one day,

767
00:40:19,557 --> 00:40:21,617
I will go home,

768
00:40:22,448 --> 00:40:25,172
and I'll be forced to live
a life without you in it.

769
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:30,023
I can't imagine a day without you in it.

770
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:46,304
Wells is back, and he
brought John with him.

771
00:40:46,306 --> 00:40:48,861
Vanessa has him locked up tight.

772
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:54,118
Wells, John, and the time
machine all in one place.

773
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:55,766
Makes things easier.

774
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:00,203
You killed Cedric Meyers.

775
00:41:02,286 --> 00:41:04,462
- He had a heart attack.
- Don't lie to me, Brooke.

776
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:06,789
Not now, not about this.

777
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:09,688
I did what I had to do
to keep your girlfriend

778
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:11,106
from finding out what you're up to.

779
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:12,805
Well, it didn't work.

780
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,493
Vanessa has Meyers' computer.

781
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,032
Then you better hope she
doesn't find anything,

782
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:21,090
or we're both screwed.

783
