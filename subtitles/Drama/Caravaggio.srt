1
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:30,765
Malta, Siracuse, Messina, Naples,
Porto Ercole. 18th July 1610.

2
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:35,909
Four years on the run,
so many labels on the luggage...

3
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,762
and hardly a friendly face, always on the move,
running under the poisonous blue sea 

4
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:46,490
running under the July sun.
Adrift...

5
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:55,907
Salt water drips on my finger
leaving a trail of tiny tears on the burning sun.

6
00:01:56,038 --> 00:02:00,547
The fisherman carrying me high
on their shoulders.

7
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:04,394
I can hear you sobbing,
Gerusalemme.

8
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,257
Rough hands wore my dying body...

9
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:14,564
..snatched from the cold blue sea.

10
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:20,300
They are lowing me back to the village,
their breath warm on my blue lips.

11
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:24,772
and dying in time of the splash of the oars

12
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:29,380
If arms steady as this embrace me and live !

13
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:35,112
to think Gerusalemme,
our friendship should end in this room...

14
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,001
..this cold white room so far from home !

15
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:57,699
The stars are the diamonds of the poor.

16
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:05,561
The richman hides the diamonds in walls...

17
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:11,049
..embarrassed to compare over the riches of
the Lord, the spark in the sky

18
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:17,817
WHISTLE

19
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:34,642
The gentlemen is confering a
great honour on our family.

20
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:41,923
Be faithful and honest, like the men of our country.

21
00:05:58,364 --> 00:06:00,863
Bleah !

22
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:45,086
Poor dumb Gerusalemme,
not used as a shepherd !

23
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:49,448
You look to true St Jhon
brought from the wilderness !

24
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,800
I told you the colours, and how
to brighten...

25
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,826
..the blood red cinnabar
and dirty grease grounded poppy and linseed.

26
00:06:57,694 --> 00:07:02,254
The art of priming, glazing with soft squirrel brushes

27
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:07,098
My companion in my loneliness !

28
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:45,393
Now I am counting the sheep
on the hill side of our house.

29
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:52,255
Pasqualone sometimes comes to move me.
his hand ¿? my hair...

30
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:55,046
..like the ripples
of the bottom of the ocean.

31
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:57,392
Far below my mother wears
a white sheet.

32
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:02,086
Bed time, Michele. Michele !''

33
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:08,157
Her voice floating like the silver mask
beholding the evening hand.

34
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,213
My true love Pasqualone, laughs.

35
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,221
Bed time Michele of the shadows

36
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:20,004
Returns holy home. the stones
clattering under our feets...

37
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:26,364
..the white sheet is
swallowed in the twilight.

38
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:35,075
''Pasqualone!''The mountains echo.
Then the darkness comes.

39
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:19,324
> How much?
- Fifty.

40
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,716
That´s deep

41
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:40,165
- Have you more at home?
> It will cost you !

42
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:16,547
Oggetto d'arte !
E io sono molto caro !

43
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:22,949
ln plain english mate, I´m an art object

44
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:26,646
and very, very expensive

45
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:31,058
Is that your money worth?

46
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,003
RlDE

47
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:00,266
I built my world
as divine mystery..

48
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,177
..found the God in the wine
and talking to my heart...

49
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:09,612
..I painted myself as Baco...

50
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:12,836
..and took on his feets: I wild
orgiastic dismenberment !

51
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,460
I raise this fragile glass
and drink to you my audience.

52
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,753
Man´s character
is his feet ¿?.

53
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,071
Why did you paint the flesh
so green?

54
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,548
I have been ill all summer,
Excellency.

55
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:30,592
- Is true to life.
- And art?

56
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:34,693
- It isn´t art.
- I see.

57
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,731
A most interesting idea.
What is your name?

58
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:44,063
- Michelangelo da Caravaggio.
- Michelangelo ? Michelangelo...

59
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:15,278
''No hope, no fear.''
The motto is rather extreme.

60
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:19,573
and the knife is illegal.

61
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:24,533
The price of the painting is my knife

62
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:26,864
I see

63
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:38,562
Show me the painting.

64
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:49,873
What have you written on the music ?

65
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:55,218
''You know that I love you.''

66
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:34,251
''Safe... to they like believe...''

67
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:43,482
''..that nothing is impossible...for you.''

68
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:49,643
''Think yourself... immortal...''

69
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:59,953
''..and capable...of understanding...''

70
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:08,789
''..all arts,
all sciences...''

71
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:13,648
''..the nature...''

72
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,606
''..of every living thing.''

73
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:19,761
''..than the...lowest deep.''

74
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:28,375
''Most higher,
than the highest pied ¿?...''

75
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,640
''..descend lower...''

76
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:42,854
Eraclito predicted from glimpse...¿?

77
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:47,210
''The way up and the way down
all one and the same.''

78
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:53,315
Bruno is repeating an old truth
in new lenguage.

79
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:58,267
That is the task.

80
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:01,539
Simple you could say...

81
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,425
..but nothing is more difficult
that simplicity.

82
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,407
Matter is in life...

83
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:23,679
God all this quotes! I can build the terror ¿? with them
perhaps he talks himself to sleep.

84
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:27,336
''...lnfinite living atom
floating like dust in a ¿?sand day.''

85
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:36,161
That, of course, is heresy.
The enemies of Bruno said...

86
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:44,563
..that ideas like that will make
the fix-stars of Aristotle fall from the heavens

87
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:50,175
..and the world wonder turning round on its own...

88
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:55,186
..like a dizzy boy.

89
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:58,469
Time to go...

90
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:24,894
You can break pause for a moment now.

91
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,327
- how is it coming?
- Is a piece of cake.

92
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,992
- You well-fixed.
- Can´t complain.

93
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:43,520
- How long have you been here ?
-where? in Rome ? - Yeah.

94
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:49,129
-Four years.
-What´s that Cardinal after?

95
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,320
Him?

96
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:54,655
Fuck all! A few cheap thrills
What else? You must be joking

97
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:08,109
- What´s his taste in music?
- Catholic.

- Ranuccio.

103
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:27,772
-He´s not been here before. is he ?
-You´ve not seen ¿?.

104
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:39,330
-You want the impossible. - Don´t you ?
- Why don´t you paint him ?

105
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:45,217
-You think is that easy ?
- It wouldn´t be the first time.

106
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:50,309
- The wine is free.
-Yeah.

107
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,823
- You really want to pay, don´t you ?
- No, Davide. I don´t want to pay.

108
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:03,341
Is a true love, then.
love at first sight !

109
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,615
- All right, you talk me other thing¿?
- I´m sorry

110
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:17,371
-Oh, fuck it. What have you been up to?
- No much.

111
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:21,992
- How´s the painting ?
- The painting ?

112
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:27,603
Do you want to know?
My painting is on the rocks.

113
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,677
St Matteo himself can´t save it ¿?.

114
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,220
It´s the most successful fucking disaster

Should I say by ¿? in the Coliseum!

I called him but he gave not answer.

00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:26,030
Dull metallic flies
cluster like rotting greens...¿?

..sul ronzante sole iridato.¿?

159
00:41:29,936 --> 00:41:33,774
 Sun keeps time
to the big to the old clock deep in the church.

160
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:38,177
The clock is as old as the time itself.

161
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:41,793
Pasqualone says:
''Old father time...

162
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:45,987
..carve his will from
the ceiling in the Garden of ¿?. ''

163
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:52,568
The flies scattered
of my shadows fall across¿?The dead red grimaces.

164
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:56,882
''Time stop for no man''. says Pasqualone.

165
00:41:56,992 --> 00:42:03,513
The rat play off his life
on the cock in the green wounded clock quite carelessly.

166
00:42:03,974 --> 00:42:09,939
''Time stop for no man, not even the sun". says Pasqualone.

167
00:42:10,584 --> 00:42:14,974
My shadows passed the fly spiral back.

168
00:42:14,985 --> 00:42:19,959
Pasqualone yawns
into the blue sky.

My Dear Frances.

-Sometimes...

subjects make the best friends.

175

I spent the morning in the Vatican.

176

They are very concern about the risk of your new loan ¿?

177
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:43,540
- They are extraordinary high.
- As indeed  the Michele Caravaggio´s fee

178
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:49,273
But St Matheu looks so very well in the gallery !

I watch the ripples in his trousers,
can I put my hand in?.

The words fall over themselves
with embarrassment.

Pasqualone sights
and remove his hands without looking at me.

I kneel beside him
and reach timidly into the dark.

There are hole on his pocket
my hand slides in.

''Harder Michele'' The air hisses to the gap in his golden teeth.

""Touch mine, Touch mine", my mouth is dry and the words refuse to come.

His body tighten.

01:18:16,056 --> 01:18:18,184
..but for the reassurning ¿?...

312
01:18:18,512 --> 01:18:23,169
..stronger than the sun in July,
richer than the Vatican...

313
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:29,115
..We have the establishment song ¿? ,
vino del Moro.

314
01:18:39,552 --> 01:18:44,060
This fucking artichokes swimming
in rancid oil !

315
01:19:37,156 --> 01:19:40,285
INAUDIBLE VOICE

316
01:20:24,997 --> 01:20:29,137
BELLS CHIME

317
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:51,285
- Eminence.
-Michele Caravaggio...

318
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:57,291
..The Holy Father and myself are prepared
to turn a blind eye to ''Sodom''...

319
01:20:57,292 --> 01:21:01,665
..provided you make it worth it
by bringing the riffraff back to Church...

320
01:21:01,667 --> 01:21:05,710
..and placing them in oath
of the path of the Holy Father...¿?

321
01:21:05,711 --> 01:21:12,749
..who is, of course, the soul and debita
of the life of our Lord Jesus Christ on earth.

322
01:21:12,849 --> 01:21:16,359
and Michele, I must advance you...

323
01:21:16,459 --> 01:21:21,718
..that this slander against my
personal life must stop.

324
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:06,009
You´ll address ''His Holiness'' as your "Holiness"
and kiss his ring without touching it...

325
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:10,074
..when he extend his hand.

326
01:22:40,406 --> 01:22:43,100
Michele Caravaggio...

327
01:22:43,228 --> 01:22:46,569
..egregio ''in urbe pictor''.

328
01:22:48,941 --> 01:22:51,001
Your Holiness.

329
01:22:51,028 --> 01:22:56,135
I heard you are a bit of a irascible¿?. One of the family

330
01:22:56,662 --> 01:23:00,455
Scipione says you paint quick.

331
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:02,660
The quicker the better.

332
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,924
I have a bloody war on my hands !

333
01:23:06,925 --> 01:23:09,305
THE POPE LAUGH

334
01:23:26,999 --> 01:23:28,794
though !

335
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:32,851
The bloody Tomassoni affair...

336
01:23:33,052 --> 01:23:36,531
..that prostitute in the Tiber.

337
01:23:36,535 --> 01:23:42,004
I know you´ve been putting it about
that my nephew did her end.¿?

338
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:47,234
Well, If the portrait looks good
you can have him

339
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,383
and good luck to you.

340
01:23:49,418 --> 01:23:55,028
Revolutionary gesture in art
can be a great help to us.

341
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:59,021
but you hadn´t thought about that,
you little bugger !

342
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:01,408
Keeps the ''quo'' in the ''status''.

343
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:06,432
Never heard of a revolution made
with paintbrushes !

344
01:24:26,885 --> 01:24:30,997
- You are out !
- You pull it off ! Fucking brilliant

345
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:42,276
What you mean ? Trick them ?

346
01:24:43,925 --> 01:24:49,832
Michele, are you blind ?
I did it for you.

347
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:05,616
- For love.
- For what ?

348
01:25:05,617 --> 01:25:10,424
- For love.
- you murdered her ?

349
01:25:10,426 --> 01:25:14,485
For you. For us.

350
01:25:14,751 --> 01:25:17,385
You murdered her.

351
01:25:29,085 --> 01:25:33,312
The first light of dawn falls
sweet¿? open window in my bedroom.

352
01:25:33,313 --> 01:25:38,203
A swallow flies in, an swoop
dark as an arrow along the beam ...

353
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:42,262
..landing with the twin, spread,
black as a crucifix on the wall.

354
01:25:42,265 --> 01:25:45,728
"It is, it is" the swallow whispers.

355
01:25:47,753 --> 01:25:50,545
The gold and dust cloud
¿? it is in the rushed air.

356
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:55,453
I lie eyes open facing the ceiling
on the great wooden bed...

357
01:25:55,455 --> 01:25:59,251
..which is the barge that beds me
across the ocean at night.

358
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:04,015
I bed my head in the pillow
and dream on my true love Pasqualone.

359
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:08,338
I´m rowing to you on the great dark ocean.

360
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:13,326
You soar dolphin
like out of my sight, laughing.

361
01:26:13,575 --> 01:26:20,049
Dolphins are not caught
with smiles, but cruely with hoax ''Michele"

362
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,226
''One day you will learn to be cruel.''

363
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:26,825
''Michele, wake  up,
Cecilia stands in the doorway.''

364
01:26:26,826 --> 01:26:30,826
holding her feather duster on his long bambu pole

365
01:26:30,989 --> 01:26:33,376
She leaps
catlike the swallow...

366
01:26:33,378 --> 01:26:37,967
..switching  her broom through the dusty stars
like a palm tree in the sirocco.

367
01:26:39,878 --> 01:26:45,442
The spell is broken. Pasqualone
stands at the window smiling.

368
01:26:45,443 --> 01:26:49,756
BELL RINGS FOR DEAD

369
01:27:12,529 --> 01:27:16,908
- Pasqualone.
- Michele.
