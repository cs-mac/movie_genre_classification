00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:05,639
I am Toyama Kinshiro, the new chief of Kitamachi Police Station.

2
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:08,309
Chief, why are you in your casual clothes again?

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,569
You're just a detective who takes orders. Shut up!

4
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:13,769
Call your chief! I want to see him!

(Metropolitan Police Department)

6
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:20,009
I vow in the name of the sakura that I won't connive any crime.

7
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:28,769
- I apologise for making you wait. 
- Thank you.

8
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:30,939
Please enjoy your food.

9
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,669
It looks delicious!

10
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,369
Thank you for the food.

11
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:59,069
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

12
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,939
No. Sorry.

13
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,009
Thank you.

14
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:15,669
Here you go.

15
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,369
Please wait a moment.

16
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,469
If you don't mind, please have this.

17
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,339
Please give me the first cake.

18
00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:33,539
I can't do that.

19
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:35,509
I'm not picky with desserts.

20
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,439
I'll accept your kindness then.

21
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:44,039
Thank you.

22
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:48,639
(Shiroyama Nobuo)

23
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,269
Thank you very much.

24
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,739
Please take care.

25
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:15,239

(Kitamachi Police Station, Metropolitan Police Department)

27
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,569
- Good morning. - Good morning.

28
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,139
Your glasses are foggy.

29
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,669
These are the reports from last night. Please sign these documents.

30
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:50,439
All right.

31
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:53,009
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

32
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,809
Chief, you're already here?

33
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:56,739
Yes.

34
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,439
Would you like to try morning yoga too?

35
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,469
It helps you de-stress,

36
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,669
and you'll no longer get irritated by trivial matters.

37
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,509
I do need that.

38
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,369
Wait. No, I'm not irritated by you, Chief.

39
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,609
An old man who was living alone is unconscious due to gas inhalation...

40
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,069
and was sent to the hospital.

41
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,209
Yes. It could be an accident or was done on purpose.

42
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,009
So Senior Minami has gone to the hospital to look into it.

43
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,439
"Shiroyama Nobuo"?

44
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:26,809
Thank you.

45
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:29,339
(Shiroyama Nobuo)

46
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:43,839
Can you describe the situation when you found your father last night?

47
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:48,239
At around 8.15 PM last night, I went to my father's house.

48
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,609
The house was full of the smell of gas, and my father was unconscious.

49
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,369
Dad!

50
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,269
(Minami Yozo, Inspector)

51
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,839
Shiroyama-san, can you come with me?

52
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,939
Okay.

53
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:00,239
Please excuse me.

54
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,139
Was it an accident or foul play?

55
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,339
The son was at a company gathering when the incident occurred.

56
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:14,469
If it was done on purpose, the criminal should be someone else.

57
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,639
Investigate both possibilities.

58
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,209
- Let's go check out the scene. - Yes, Sir.

59
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,169
How is Shiroyama-san?

60
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,369
Chief.

61
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,209
Are you following us to the scene again?

62
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:24,009
Yes. I've met him before.

63
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,369
So how is he?

64
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,439
He's still unconscious.

65
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,269
What do you mean by "you've met him before"?

66
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:29,409
Well...

67
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,209
We met again.

68
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:35,609
You're the person who gave us the cake yesterday.

69
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,009
We're from Kitamachi Police Station.

70
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,039
Are you a relative of Shiroyama-san?

71
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:42,979
I'm working at a nursing facility Shiroyama-san seeks help from.

72
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,939
I'm Okuda Yuriko.

73
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,709
I thought you were his daughter.

74
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,639
You two seemed to get along very well.

75
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,909
I heard something happened to him. I was shocked, so I came...

76
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:52,369
What are you doing here?

77
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,309
How dare you come?

78
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,639
Calm down.

79
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:01,609
What do you mean?

80
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,169
This woman hurt my father in order to get his assets.

81
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,309
If my father passes away, she'll be the largest beneficiary.

82
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:14,439
She tried to kill my father!

83
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:20,141
They make up less than 0.1 percent...

84
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:21,941
of the total number of police officers.

85
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:25,311
They have a high chance of becoming the superiors of the organisation.

86
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:28,481
We call them...

87
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,941
elite bureaucrats.

88
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:33,611
(Offbeat Chief Police)

89
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:41,811
You were with Shiroyama-san yesterday, weren't you?

90
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:47,641
I sent Shiroyama-san home at around 3 PM...

91
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,641
and helped him clean his house.

92
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:53,311
What did you do with the gas shutoff valve?

93
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:57,711
It's dangerous for him to use the stove, so I always turn it off.

94
00:05:57,811 --> 00:06:01,341
I left at around 6 PM yesterday.

95
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:03,541
Did you lock the door?

96
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:07,511
Yes. I have the keys to his house.

97
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:14,541
May I know why Shiroyama-san left his assets to you?

98
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:18,281
I also have no idea.

99
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:20,641
I only looked after him.

100
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:24,381
Did you know Shiroyama-san changed his will?

101
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,711
I didn't.

102
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:30,281
Regardless of that, he's out of danger now, right?

103
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:34,311
I believe he'll recover. We just have to wait.

104
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:41,481
I have to get back to work.

105
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,241
Thank you for your cooperation.

106
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,081
We might visit you again to talk about this incident.

107
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:56,611
If she knew about the will,

108
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,611
she would the motive to kill Shiroyama-san, doesn't she?

109
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,341
But she just said she didn't know about it.

110
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:05,341
No suspect would tell the truth right from the start.

111
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:07,581
But you shouldn't suspect her too.

112
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,141
Where are you going?

113
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:13,011
To go check out the scene. Let's all go.

114
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:16,141
Why is the chief doing our job?

115
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,711
Thank you for your hard work.

116
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,181
Has the chief come to observe us again?

117
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:37,811
He's causing us trouble.

118
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,411
Just ignore him.

119
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:41,711
- Report the situation. - Yes, Sir.

120
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:44,881
Shiroyama was sleeping here when the gas leak happened.

121
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:47,981
And there were no signs of a struggle here.

122
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,711
What's this?

123
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,041
I think it's a stain from the paints.

124
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:56,711
Look. It's Okuda Yuriko-san.

125
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:03,111
Where's the gas shutoff valve?

126
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:05,841
It's here.

127
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:09,011
It would be hard for him to turn it off when he's in a wheelchair.

128
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,441
I wonder if it was a coincidence,

129
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:13,641
but the gas leak alarm placed up there was unplugged.

130
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:15,141
Is this medicine?

131
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:22,511
"Three times daily for seven days a week, before and after meals."

132
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:25,581
He did take his medication after dinner yesterday.

133
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,781
His son visited him at around 8 PM last night.

134
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,681
If someone tried to suffocate him with a gas leak,

135
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,451
it would have happened between 6 PM to 8 PM.

136
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:37,541
Someone? But there was no sign of the house being broken in.

137
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:40,081
Okuda Yuriko could have done it.

138
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:41,641
She could be after his assets.

139
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:45,451
She would inherit assets worth 50 million yen if he's dead.

140
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:47,911
Something feels weird.

141
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:52,181
If Yuriko-san really was the criminal,

142
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,511
after she left here at 6 PM,

143
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:58,511
she would have to come back right after that.

144
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,041
Why would she bother to do that?

145
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:05,311
Can you please stop criticising our investigation?

146
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:07,951
We're investigating Okuda Yuriko!

147
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,311
- Yes, Sir! - Yes, Sir!

148
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:12,481
Senior, the chief is following us.

149
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,481
Ignore him!

150
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,241
He's right. Don't mind me.

151

153
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:23,451
Onokura-san!

154
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:25,511
Not here, it's over there!

155
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:27,641
Let's go take a bath.

156
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:32,611
The job is tough. I definitely would be able to do this.

157
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:36,041
Hi. May I help you?

158
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:38,081
Excuse me. We're from Kitamachi Police Station.

159
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:39,211
Kitamachi Police Station?

160
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:42,881
We'd like to talk to Okuda Yuriko regarding Shiroyama Nobuo-san.

161
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,041
Please wait a moment.

162
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:47,781
Okuda-san!

163
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:49,711
Some people are looking for you.

164
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:55,811
We think...

165
00:09:55,881 --> 00:10:00,411
there's a high possibility someone tried to murder Shiroyama-san.

166
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:06,141
You said you had left his house at around 6 PM.

167
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:07,711
Where did you go after that?

168
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:12,381
Are you suspecting me?

169
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:15,041
I apologise. We have to question everyone.

170
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:17,311
Where did you go after 6 PM?

171
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,281
I...

172
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:27,141
She was with me.

173
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:31,281
I asked her to bring me out for a stroll at a park nearby.

174
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,781
This is Kogure Taomi-san, he's one of the residents here.

175
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:38,451
When did you go for a walk?

176
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:41,711
From 6 PM to 8.30 PM.

177
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:43,081
She has an alibi then.

178
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:47,081
Why didn't you tell us that before?

179
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,381
I was actually not working yesterday.

180
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:54,211
I was looking after Shiroyama-san and Kogure-san on my own time.

181
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,041
That's against the rules.

182
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:00,881
Okay.

183
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:04,211
An elite is indeed different when it comes to paperwork.

184
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:05,581
No, this is nothing.

185
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:08,541
By the way, has Minami-san and the others made any progress...

186
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:10,811
in the Shiroyama Nobuo investigation?

187
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,941
There's a suspicious woman,

188
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,811
so they're investigating based on the assumption of attempted murder.

189
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:18,011
- Attempted murder? - Yes, Sir.

190
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:19,081
Place your seal here.

191
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:23,941
Please stop interfering with their investigation.

192
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:32,141
I had to find a lot of excuses to cover up for you...

193
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:36,041
No, I mean, to assist you. I already...

194
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,141
(Safety)

195
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:38,911
Chief!

196
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,810
Okuda Yuriko, 35,

197
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:44,541
had a tough time as her parents passed away when she was little.

198
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,510
She started working at Futaba Garden three years ago.

199
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,311
She doesn't really have any friends or acquaintances.

200
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:56,641
Is she in debt? Is there any financially related issue?

201
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,081
She's not in debt,

202
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:01,181
but for a nurse who earns only 180,000 yen per month,

203
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:02,811
her clothes look very nice.

204
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:04,881
Perhaps she cut down on other living expenses?

205
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,811
Is that why she's after the old man's assets?

206
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:12,141
What do you want?

207
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,781
It's nothing. I just found out Okura Yuriko-san...

208
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:16,941
is still considered a suspect, so I was concerned.

209
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:19,311
Okuda Yuriko is the most likely suspect.

210
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:21,311
But she has an alibi that night, doesn't she?

211
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,440
She secretly made the old man, Kogure, lie for her.

212
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,841
I'm sure she seduced him.

213
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:28,941
She does give off a sexy vibe.

214
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:32,041
Aikawa-san would never be able to pull it off.

215
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,211
An adult woman's attraction.

216
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:35,381
What you just said could be considered as sexual harassment.

217
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,241
Anyway, Kogure must have been seduced by her.

218
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:40,141
This is dangerous.

219
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,241
If you investigate a case with such a preconception,

220
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:44,941
you might wrongly imprison an innocent person instead.

221
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:47,141
So do you mean Okuda Yuriko is innocent?

222
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:48,881
It's just my hunch as a police officer.

223
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:50,811
Senior!

224
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:52,841
Okuda Yuriko-san's alibi has been proven to be false.

225
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:55,611
She didn't go to the park as she claimed.

226
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,711
I guess your hunch is wrong.

227
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,681
Question Kogure Taomi and Okuda Yuriko again!

228
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:02,811
- Yes, Sir! - Yes, Sir!

229
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:07,211
I'll tag along.

230
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:10,211
Is there anyone who can prove that you were at the park?

231
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:13,041
Well...

232
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:17,811
I'll be glad if you can find such a person for me.

233
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:18,981
You'll be glad?

234
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,181
You weren't at the park nor were you at Shiroyama-san's house.

235
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:24,281
You were somewhere else, weren't you?

236
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:26,641
Why do you think so?

237
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:29,811
Because I don't think you're the culprit.

238
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,511
But it's the police's job to suspect us.

239
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:38,011
My job is to protect the citizens.

240
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:42,741
So please help me prove your innocence.

241
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:46,541
Prove my innocence?

242
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:49,911
Where were you that night?

243
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:53,081
I'll come here every day until you tell me the truth.

244
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:58,881
You seem to have a lot of free time, Sir.

245
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,541
I'll help you with your work too. As volunteer work of course.

246
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:08,641
You meet the suspect and tell her you would prove her innocence?

247
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:10,411
Are you serious?

248
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:11,511
Very much so.

249
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,881
You're going to interfere with our investigation!

250
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:17,211
It would be too late to act after an innocent person is convicted.

251
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:31,211
This is my first time working as a helper. I'm nervous.

252
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:32,311
Aren't you, Aikawa-san?

253
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:34,611
I only came because Senior told me to.

254
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,211
Sir,

255
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,041
why do you think that person isn't the culprit?

256
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:42,681
She can't provide a decent alibi.

257
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:45,111
That means she did something she doesn't want others to find out.

258
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,211
You also think she's the culprit, don't you?

259
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:52,481
A completely unrelated outsider became the beneficiary.

260
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,081
I do think it's suspicious.

261
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:55,511
Good morning!

262
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:57,411
Good morning.

263
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,341
At this care facility,

264
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:03,541
some of the elderly are here are long-term residents...

265
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,141
while some only stay here during the day.

266
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:06,811
We provide both services.

267
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:10,011
This care facility really helps people a lot.

268
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:15,511
But we can't accept the elderly who need higher level care.

269
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:19,011
Let's go upstairs.

270
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:20,711
- Does it hurt? - No.

271
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:23,311
Towel him off like this instead.

272
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,581
I see.

273
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:29,981
Is it delicious?

274
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:37,481
Aikawa-san, please get me some tissues.

275
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,941
- They're over there. - Yes, Sir!

276
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,811
Extend your left leg.

277
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,311
That's right.

278
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:43,711
- Just a little bit more. - Right leg.

279
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:44,781
Keep going.

280
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:47,211
- That's right. Come on. - Left leg.

281
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,341
You can do it!

282
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:52,081
Well done!

283
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,641
Kogure-san?

284
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:04,441
You leg must hurt a lot.

285
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:07,181
- What happened? - No. I'm fine.

286
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:09,711
Please excuse me. Get move aside.

287
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:14,141
My goodness.

288
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:15,541
Thank you for your hard work.

289
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:17,711
- Thank you. - Please excuse us.

290
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:20,811
Are we really investigating the case?

291
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,581
I apologise so much.

292
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:26,211
We don't have enough staff here. You really helped us a lot!

293
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:27,711
No, we learnt a lot too.

294
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:30,211
But it is tough being a care facility worker.

295
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:34,041
But you still take good care of your appearance.

296
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:38,541
I try to avoid fancy colours, but the elders would tease me,

297
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:42,311
and say "A woman should always wear some lipstick."

298
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,781
- What's the matter? - Yes?

299
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,181
You looked at me, didn't you?

300
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:48,981
Toyama-san,

301
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,511
please help me change these bed sheets.

302
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:52,581
Sure. I'll entrust this to you.

303
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:53,681
Here you go.

304
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:55,311
Thank you very much.

305
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:03,581
- Excuse me. - Yes?

306
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:07,151
Do you know anything about Okuda Yuriko-san?

307
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,711
Did you do that for Shiroyama-san too?

308
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:23,911
They would mix up their medication if there's too many of them.

309
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,081
All right. Done.

310
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:29,651
Okay. Kogure-san, I'll put them here.

311
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:31,041
Thank you.

312
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:37,081
You're still suspecting her regarding that incident?

313
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:39,581
Well... You can say so.

314
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:43,941
I told you we were at the park. It's true!

315
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:47,611
Please excuse me.

316
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,581
I need to talk to you.

317
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,781
What?

318
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:56,581
Yuriko-san inherited other people's assets before?

319
00:17:56,651 --> 00:17:57,441
Yes, Sir.

320
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:01,011
It was a 70-year-old old man at a facility she used to work at.

321
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:04,181
Perhaps Yuriko-san looked after them so well that they were willing...

322
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:05,441
to have her inherit their assets?

323
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:07,581
Chief, you're acting weird!

324
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,841
Isn't it more natural to think that she did something in order to...

325
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:12,441
get the inheritance from them?

326
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:18,011
I can't trust that person like you do.

327
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:20,881
Okuda Yuriko has inherited other people's assets before this?

328
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:24,181
She resigned right after that old man passed away.

329
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,311
She's really something.

330
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,811
Thank you for the precious information.

331
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:32,311
Now I'm more convinced that she's the culprit.

332
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:35,811
If this was football, this would be kicking a great pass to the forward.

333
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,981
Please don't make any unfounded assumptions regarding her past.

334
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,011
Never presume an innocent person is guilty.

335
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,151
That's our job as the police.

336
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:48,151
It's our job to arrest criminals who pretend to be innocent.

337
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:51,711
- Let's go. - Yes, Sir!

338
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:14,411
Osakabe-san?

339
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:15,911
Hi.

340
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,881
I see.

341
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:21,711
Because you went to that woman,

342
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:25,441
Minami-kun got a piece of very useful information.

343
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:29,241
To me, this strawberry mochi from you is more useful.

344
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:36,111
But if you look at the situation,

345
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:40,941
that nurse does seem to be very suspicious indeed.

346
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:45,541
Can you confirm she's not the culprit?

347
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:49,151
Well, I don't think she's a suspect.

348
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:52,981
Even if she isn't the culprit,

349
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,041
she sounds like she's not easy to handle.

350
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:58,881
I think she doesn't want to explain her alibi...

351
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:01,581
because she's trying to protect something.

352
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:06,811
I'll definitely prove that.

353
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:12,441
The way you run on your own on a muddy path like this...

354
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:17,011
resembles your late father a lot.

355
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:22,611
But don't go overboard putting up a one-man show.

356
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:24,241
I understand.

357
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:29,741
But scoring a goal right now is more important.

358
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,573
Are you okay? Please stop crying.

359
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,343
There's no need to cry.

360
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,843
I don't want to leave.

361
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:51,243
What happened to that lady?

362
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,743
She's been forced to go home.

363
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:59,573
According to the rules here, you'll be forced to leave...

364
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:03,313
if your illness worsens, Alzheimer's becomes severe,

365
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:08,613
or your ability to care for yourself degrades greatly.

366
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:13,043
She's despised at her own home.

367
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:15,973
You might as well die...

368
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,143
once you're thrown out of here.

369
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:26,213
At your previous workplace,

370
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:30,573
a capitalist, Goto Sueyuki-san, passed away due to a heart attack.

371
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:32,913
Before he passed away,

372
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:37,743
he left a will saying that he would pass all his assets to you.

373
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:40,943
Is this a coincidence?

374
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:45,473
I was also suspected by the police back then.

375
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:50,813
They asked if I had done something to him.

376
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:56,173
But just like this time, I knew nothing about the will.

377
00:21:56,473 --> 00:21:59,613
But you did inherit Goto-san's assets.

378
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:03,543
I did accept the money. What's the problem with that?

379
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,573
That's 80 million yen worth of assets.

380
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:07,673
That was his wish.

381
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,973
Yuriko-san,

382
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:11,273
after experiencing it myself,

383
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:14,843
I realised how tough it is to look after the elderly.

384
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:19,913
But if you forced the elders...

385
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,813
and did something to them,

386
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:26,543
I will never forgive you.

387
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:31,673
A good student who pretends to be well-behaved.

388
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:38,543
I can never be friends with people like you my whole life.

389
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:55,243
Don't push yourself too much. Feel your breath slowly.

390
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:57,113
Now lean to the other side.

391
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:58,343
Rika-san?

392
00:22:58,413 --> 00:22:59,813
That's right.

393
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:02,813
Urasawa-san, what's going on?

394
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,613
Toyama-san recommended we organise this event.

395
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:09,143
Yoga can prevent metabolic decline and muscle degeneration.

396
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:12,973
It's very suitable for people who want to stay healthy.

397
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:16,443
He made us do this.

398
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:22,243
That's nice, Kogure-san. Don't go too hard on yourself.

399
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:23,743
Okay.

400
00:23:23,843 --> 00:23:25,743
Exhale slowly.

401
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:29,573
Rika-san, thank you very much.

402
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:33,543
I'm always available whenever you need help.

403
00:23:34,273 --> 00:23:36,973
- I'll see you again at the studio. - Sure.

404
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,443
Please excuse me now.

405
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:44,443
Kin-san really enjoys helping people.

406
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:46,073
He's such a nice person.

407
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:47,813
Bye.

408
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:49,643
Okay.

409
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:53,313
How was the yoga?

410
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:57,473
Well, it was definitely worth trying.

411
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,443
Is your leg giving you trouble again?

412
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:04,473
Don't try to get to me with this little show.

413
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,273
I won't tell you anything.

414
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:09,443
I just hope the elders here can live healthily.

415
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:12,873
Kin-san, come play shogi with us.

416
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:15,173
Sure. I'm coming!

417
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:18,243
I won't go easy on you.

418
00:24:18,313 --> 00:24:19,973
- Same here. - This guy is a strong player.

419
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,043
Indeed.

420
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:23,943
- Can you win? I always win. - It won't be a problem.

421
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:25,913
But I won last time.

422
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:27,913
But I remember it was me who won.

423
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,943
How long do I have to do this?

424
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:01,073
Yuriko-san?

425
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:03,873
Are you okay? I'll go get help.

426
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:08,213
I'm okay! Don't tell anyone. I'll be fine in a second.

427
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,813
But you don't look well.

428
00:25:15,073 --> 00:25:16,643
It's just gastroenteritis.

429
00:25:17,173 --> 00:25:19,973
Why are you still here? You're annoying.

430
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:35,973
Are you okay?

431
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:41,443
That was fast.

432
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:44,843
She reports everything to you, doesn't she?

433
00:25:46,443 --> 00:25:48,913
She's very passionate about her work.

434
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:53,143
Speaking of being passionate, the same goes for you too.

435
00:25:55,613 --> 00:25:59,043
Can you really prove my innocence?

436
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:04,343
The situation doesn't look good, but I'll try my best.

437
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:08,573
Why do you think I'm innocent?

438
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:12,443
You know nothing about me.

439
00:26:13,743 --> 00:26:15,743
I learnt a lot about you...

440
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:17,413
at that one moment.

441
00:26:21,673 --> 00:26:23,673
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

442
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:31,773
You rushed forward to protect Shiroyama-san.

443
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:35,743
And when you were sure he was fine,

444
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:38,543
you were very relieved.

445
00:26:40,073 --> 00:26:42,913
Such a person would never hurt Shiroyama-san.

446
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:44,743
That's what I think.

447
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:58,243
When I was little,

448
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:02,243
I stayed in a dirty small house that was full of rubbish.

449
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:05,173
I was always hungry.

450
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:09,313
No one would buy me the things I wanted.

451
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:15,173
One day, one of my classmates lost her wallet.

452
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:18,743
And I was the first one who was suspected.

453
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:22,543
They said I was poor, so I must have stolen it.

454
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:23,973
Give it back to me!

455
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:30,573
But a boy came forward and spoke up for me.

456
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:36,743
Although he was a little weird, he was smart and kind.

457
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:39,313
He said in front of everyone,

458
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:42,943
"Don't accuse someone if you have no evidence."

459
00:27:44,273 --> 00:27:48,673
I was so happy I nearly cried.

460
00:27:54,313 --> 00:27:56,313
But my heart ached very much.

461
00:27:58,073 --> 00:28:00,443
Because the person who stole the wallet...

462
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,613
really was me.

463
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:12,243
The end.

464
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:15,543
That's all for today. You may leave now.

465
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:23,573
Okay.

466
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:48,413
I heard from Rika-san...

467
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:52,273
that Kin-san did yoga with the elders at the nursing facility.

468
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:54,473
He's pretending to be investigating but he's actually having fun.

469
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:56,373
He's the chief anyway. What's the problem with that?

470
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,973
If you don't like it, why don't you go get yourself promoted?

471
00:28:58,043 --> 00:28:59,873
I bumped into someone I knew from the yoga class.

472
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:02,513
It's been a while since we last met. We had a chat and she told me...

473
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,413
she used to look after her bedridden husband herself,

474
00:29:05,473 --> 00:29:07,943
but she had just recently sent him to a nursing facility.

475
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:10,943
She isn't so burdened now.

476
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:14,713
Hey, if Dad becomes bedridden, what should we do?

477
00:29:14,773 --> 00:29:16,713
We definitely won't be able to look after him.

478
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:19,573
He's so huge, and he's very stubborn.

479
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:21,673
So we can only send him to a nursing facility then.

480
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:23,973
How dare you!

481
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:28,073
But he's so stubborn and never listens to others.

482
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,343
He would definitely be isolated if he's sent to a nursing facility.

483
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:33,273
That's true! Dad, we'll go visit you...

484
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:34,613
sometimes.

485
00:29:35,143 --> 00:29:36,613
I won't go to such a place!

486
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,213
All right. If that's what you think,

487
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:41,813
take care of your health and make sure you get enough exercise.

488
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,573
All right!

489
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:52,573
Hello? Minami speaking.

490
00:29:57,243 --> 00:29:59,543
Last night, you and Yuriko-san...

491
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:01,843
Chief?

492
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:07,243
Senior? Why are you here?

493
00:30:07,313 --> 00:30:09,673
We're here to bring Okuda Yuriko to the police station.

494
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:13,043
Someone saw her quarrelling with Shiroyama-san.

495
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:17,843
What happened?

496
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:19,613
Kogure-san...

497
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,043
Are you okay?

498
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,499
Thank you. Bye.

499
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:40,259
Kogure-san isn't in a life-threatening condition.

500
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:41,059
Really?

501
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:45,129
Was it a coincidence that you were at the scene when Kogure-san fell?

502
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,999
Yes.

503
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:50,829
When I found him, he had already...

504
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:53,359
Including this morning's incident,

505
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:56,399
you're starting to look very suspicious.

506
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,329
A month ago,

507
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:02,059
at a cafe near the hospital Shiroyama went to regularly,

508
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,859
Shiroyama told you, "I can't live without you."

509
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:08,059
"Just listen to this old man."

510
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:09,799
He got more and more excited,

511
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:12,599
and he passed you an envelope that looked to be full of cash.

512
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:15,199
But you just looked at him coldly.

513
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:21,059
You grew up in poverty.

514
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,199
You would care about money very much, right?

515
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,029
What you said makes me sad.

516
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,759
And you've misunderstood our relationship.

517
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:47,059
Shiroyama-san and I weren't in that kind of relationship.

518
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:48,729
It didn't go well when you tried to break up with him.

519
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,259
And Shiroyama-san became a burden,

520
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:54,159
so you tried to kill him by gas inhalation.

521
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:55,499
And this morning,

522
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,829
you tried to murder Kogure-san who had found out the truth.

523
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:00,029
Isn't that right?

524
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:03,699
If you want to arrest me, show me the evidence.

525
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,329
If you don't have it, I'm leaving. I'm not obliged to be here.

526
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:16,829
Yuriko-san.

527
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:22,399
I wonder who will be faster.

528
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,529
Will I be arrested first,

529
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:29,259
or will you be able to prove my innocence first?

530
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,059
I'll definitely prove your innocence.

531
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:34,199
I promise.

532
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:39,559
Do you really trust me?

533
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:52,329
- Thanks for your hard work. - Good morning!

534
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,459
Aikawa,

535
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:55,129
you're not with the chief.

536
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:58,499
Does that mean he gave up trying to prove that woman's innocence?

537
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,599
Didn't he say we're presuming an innocent person guilty?

538
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,329
Did that young man finally wake up?

539
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:06,729
Who woke up?

540
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:10,399
More importantly, how's Kogure-san?

541
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:13,229
Well, he's still unconscious.

542
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:15,329
When he wakes up,

543
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:19,529
we'll obtain the evidence we need to arrest Okuda Yuriko.

544
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,629
We just have to gather more evidence. She'll be arrested soon.

545
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:25,599
- Who can be sure of that? - Okuda Yuriko is the criminal.

546
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:29,999
That is my gut feeling as a detective.

547
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,429
I've found a new information!

548
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:36,499
In the evening of Shiroyama's incident,

549
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,129
Kogure was at Koto General Hospital that he's now hospitalised at.

550
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:41,099
A hospital?

551
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:44,899
He fell down near the facility and hurt his leg.

552
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:46,159
His leg?

553
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:51,999
You might as well die once you're thrown out of here.

554
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:54,259
She seemed to be very ill.

555
00:33:55,229 --> 00:33:58,329
So Okuda Yuriko's alibi of taking a stroll in the park with Kogure...

556
00:33:58,429 --> 00:33:59,499
was indeed a lie.

557
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:02,999
No, Yuriko-san was with Kogure-san.

558
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:05,859
She would have told us frankly if they were together.

559
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:07,669
She had no reason to lie about her alibi.

560
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:10,399
No, she had the reason to lie.

561
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,229
I'll be right back!

562
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,999
Hey!

563
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,169
Toyama-san.

564
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,059
I thought you wouldn't come again.

565
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:32,669
I already found out...

566
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,559
where you went and what you did.

567
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:42,329
Yuriko-san, you were at the hospital with Kogure-san, weren't you?

568
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:49,699
There were two reasons why you didn't explain your alibi.

569
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:53,929
The first reason was for Kogure-san.

570
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:58,859
That day, Kogure-san called you and told you he fell,

571
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,629
so you sent him to the hospital.

572
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,499
And according to the diagnosis,

573
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,829
Kogure-san's legs are suffering from progressive paralysis.

574
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:11,029
If the nursing facility found out about it,

575
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:14,399
Kogure-san would be requested to leave the facility.

576
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,329
That's why you couldn't explain your alibi.

577
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:24,859
And the second reason?

578
00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:26,859
It was for yourself.

579
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:35,229
You received treatment at the same hospital that day.

580
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:40,929
You didn't want anyone at the facility to know.

581
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:47,499
It must have been hard for you, but you held it in.

582
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:57,759
You really did find out.

583
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:08,129
I have stomach cancer.

584
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:15,669
When it was diagnosed a month ago, I was told I had only a year left.

585
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:22,029
That day,

586
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:28,059
Kogure-san asked me for help.

587
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,929
I'm the only person Kogure-san could rely on.

588
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:39,729
I didn't want him to be thrown out and be alone.

589
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:42,899
So even though you were suspected by the police,

590
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:47,429
you decided to protect Kogure-san.

591
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:53,399
I'm not as great a person as you think.

592
00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:01,259
Toyama-san, this is all your fault.

593
00:37:03,669 --> 00:37:07,759
You said you would come every day until you found out the truth.

594
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:13,929
So I thought I wouldn't see you again if I told the truth.

595
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,669
You can still see me any time.

596
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:20,699
You're really bad at lying.

597
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:24,929
Yuriko-san!

598
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,329
I'm sorry.

599
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:32,899
It's okay.

600
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:41,329
Could it be...

601
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,529
What's this?

602
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:51,129
There was also a lipstick stain on Shiroyama-san's bed sheet.

603
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,999
That wasn't me.

604
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,169
I don't usually put on lipstick.

605
00:37:57,229 --> 00:37:58,129
What?

606
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:02,259
I only put on lipstick today because I didn't want to worry them.

607
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:14,699
This is such a surprise.

608
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:17,669
The culprit wasn't Okuda Yuriko.

609
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:23,359
You're the one who tried to murder Shiroyama-san, right?

610
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,399
Urasawa Nanae-san.

611
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:28,229
Me?

612
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:32,729
Why would I murder Shiroyama-san?

613
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,629
You slipped in a sleeping pill in his medication...

614
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:38,199
that was to be taken after dinner.

615
00:38:39,169 --> 00:38:43,229
Later, you entered Shiroyama-san's house with a spare key,

616
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:47,699
moved him onto his bed...

617
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:54,399
and turned on the gas.

618
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:04,329
But when you were moving him onto his bed,

619
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:08,059
your lipstick stained his bed sheet.

620
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:17,199
Isn't that Okuda-san's lipstick?

621
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:20,629
I've never been to Shiroyama-san's house before.

622
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:24,599
There were lip prints on the bed sheet. Just like fingerprints,

623
00:39:24,669 --> 00:39:28,029
every person has different lip prints and they never change.

624
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,169
According to the forensic test,

625
00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:33,669
Yuriko-san's lip prints and the lip prints on the bed sheet...

626
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:35,329
do not match.

627
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:39,329
Well then, let's examine the lip prints on this.

628
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:42,599
Since you've never entered Shiroyama-san's house before,

629
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:45,029
your lip prints shouldn't be there too.

630
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,859
Old man Shiroyama told me...

631
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:05,529
that he wanted to secretly pass his properties to that woman.

632
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:10,459
I'm also a nurse, but look at what he told me. Was he out of his mind?

633
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,629
It's so unfair.

634
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:14,259
So what you did to Shiroyama-san...

635
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,859
He better die.

636
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:18,669
I hoped the police would suspect that woman.

637
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:21,559
So you're also the one who hurt Kogure-san as well.

638
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:25,429
If he told the truth,

639
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:28,259
that woman's innocence would be proven.

640
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:30,499
You hate Yuriko-san that much?

641
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,899
I'm the one who works really hard!

642
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:35,459
I didn't try to use my advantage as a woman...

643
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:38,429
and worked hard.

644
00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:41,599
But no one understood me!

645
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,759
Everyone was seduced by that woman.

646
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:47,129
No one appreciates me!

647
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:49,229
I can't stand this.

648
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:53,099
Due to jealousy, you hurt innocent people...

649
00:40:53,169 --> 00:40:54,729
and even tried to murder the elderly.

650
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:58,559
You have such an ugly heart. Who would appreciate you?

651
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,329
You yourself are to blame...

652
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:04,169
that no one cares about you.

653
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:05,999
Don't try to blame other people.

654
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,029
You think you're that great?

655
00:41:08,529 --> 00:41:10,259
Who are you anyway?

656
00:41:13,729 --> 00:41:16,259
I'm the chief here, Toyama Kinshiro.

657
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:24,699
I vow in the name of the sakura that I won't connive any crime.

658
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:46,699
Senior Minami, I'll entrust the rest of the work to you.

659
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:48,559
You proved that you were right.

660
00:41:49,129 --> 00:41:51,829
You must feel very satisfied now, don't you?

661
00:41:51,899 --> 00:41:54,599
I just didn't want to wrongly convict an innocent person.

662
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:57,669
You got lucky this time.

663
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:00,329
You'll definitely get yourself into trouble one day.

664
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:05,029
No matter how I did it, a goal is a goal, isn't it?

665
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:10,699
How does the chief...

666
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:14,359
trust a person so much?

667
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:20,329
I envy his faith.

668
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:25,169
Let's get on with the interrogation.

669
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,259
Please pardon my intrusion.

670
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:52,669
So you're the chief Toyama-san. I'm so surprised.

671
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:54,759
People always say I don't look like one.

672
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:59,429
Your subordinates must be under a lot of pressure.

673
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,499
(Yuriko-san. Thank you for your hard work all this while)

674
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:08,929
Did you resign?

675
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:10,029
Yes.

676
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,329
Because I can't go on working with a smile anymore.

677
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:20,929
Please excuse me.

678
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:24,229
Hello? Toyama speaking.

679
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:29,729
Got it. I'll return to the station immediately.

680
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:34,559
I'll have to excuse myself now.

681
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,259
I'll come again.

682
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,029
Don't come again.

683
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:49,229
I hope you remember me as I was in my healthy condition.

684
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:57,059
You said you had stolen a wallet when you were young.

685
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:00,999
But you didn't, did you?

686
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:06,429
Last year, a total of 80 million yen...

687
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:09,899
was donated to various charitable organisations...

688
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:12,759
from your bank account.

689
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:18,829
Yuriko-san, you're bad at lying too.

690
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:24,699
Toyama-san...

691
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:30,329
Thank you.

692
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:40,059
Aikawa-san? Why are you here?

693
00:44:40,129 --> 00:44:41,659
I was ordered to by the deputy chief.

694
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:44,599
He told me to escort you back to the police station.

695
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:46,329
Really? I'm sorry to make you come all the way here.

696
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:47,559
Let's go.

697
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:52,259
Hello? Aikawa speaking.

698
00:44:53,259 --> 00:44:56,159
Yes, Sir. Understood. I'll be right there.

699
00:44:56,229 --> 00:44:57,099
Is there a case?

700
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,559
A house was broken into at Shiotsuki 4-chome.

701
00:44:59,629 --> 00:45:00,759
Let's go to the scene.

702
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:01,999
Chief, you're going too?

703
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:03,829
Since there's a case, I can't ignore it.

704
00:45:03,899 --> 00:45:07,259
Wait, Chief!

705
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:09,129
A threatening letter?

706
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:10,329
I have your daughter.

707
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:11,259
What do you want?

708
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:13,259
Megumi-chan will be in great danger if we can't find out where she is.

709
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:16,329
What does the culprit want Minami-san to apologise about?

710
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:17,459
Time's up.

711
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:19,559
- Megumi-san? - Megumi-chan?

712
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:22,629
Don't step into my territory.

713
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:25,729
How can police work with criminals?

714
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,416
I'm in charge here. Stay in your office and wait for our reports!
