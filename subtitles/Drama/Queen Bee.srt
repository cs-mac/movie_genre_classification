1
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:28,417
I saw the car coming.

2
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:31,315
If you was Miss Jennifer,
you'd be expected.

3
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,819
Go right in.

4
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:56,869
I'll tell them in back you arrived.

5
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,183
It's Mama! I heard the car.

6
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:08,415
It's too soon for Mama.

7
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,751
Hey there, be careful.

8
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:15,057
He's learning.
He has to learn sometime.

9
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:16,961
Oh, my, but I'd be afraid.

10
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:20,801
We're Phillips people.
Phillips people aren't afraid.

11
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,369
I don't like you.

12
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:25,735
Well, I like you.

13
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:28,468
Don't make no never mind.
I don't like you.

14
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:30,169
I like you.

15
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:32,942
I'm Jennifer.

16
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:34,117
How do you do?

17
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:38,049
Children, here's your mama's cousin,
Jennifer from Chicago.

18
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:41,089
She's come to stay with us.
Say, "How do."

19
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,554
Are we kissing kin?

20
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,523
I hope so.

21
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:49,126
I'm Trissa, and that's Ted.

22
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:52,496
He won't kiss you.
He hates kissing.

23
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,463
You'll get over that, boy.

24
00:02:56,673 --> 00:03:00,508
Show Miss Jennifer to her room.
In the left wing, across from you.

25
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:02,504
Thank you.

26
00:03:02,712 --> 00:03:06,046
Don't you pull away from me, boy.
I got a good look at you.

27
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:09,981
And I never saw such ears
on a human in my whole life.

28
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:12,621
You fixing to grow potatoes in there?

29
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:21,292
My, what a lovely room!

30
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:24,935
The bathroom's across the hall.
We all use it.

31
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:29,266
You have to jiggle the handle
three times, or it runs forever.

32
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:37,971
That's my room, next is Ted,
then Aunt Carol.

33
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:41,276
You'll admire her.
She's old like you.

34
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:47,788
Don't go worrying about the bathroom.

35
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:50,085
About us all using it, I mean.

36
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,262
We always knock.

37
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:55,265
Almost always.

38
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,722
Carol, we've talked enough.

39
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,420
Jud, wait, will you please?

40
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:30,064
We've gone over it 100 times.
What more is there to say?

41
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:33,202
I don't want her to know
we're engaged, that's all.

42
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:34,564
Does it make any difference?

43
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,899
It makes me a heel with your brother.

44
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:39,167
After all, he is my friend and my job.

45
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:40,674
Your job!

46
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:43,037
Everything you do starts
with the mill.

47
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:44,805
I'm getting sick of the mill!

48
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:47,746
Why? It pays for all of this.

49
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:50,848
We have an audience.

50
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:54,785
Welcome to Phillips House.

51
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:10,171
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

52
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,706
Pay no attention to what Jud says.

53
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:15,879
He isn't usually so bad-tempered.

54
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:20,973
I'm Carol Lee Phillips.
You must be Jennifer.

55
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:22,652
You're just in time for tea.

56
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:26,482
That's what we call it when we drink
too much in the afternoon.

57
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,559
The mills have
to get together on this.

58
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:33,923
Jud runs the mill.

59
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,326
Or it'd have to run itself.
Talk to Jud.

60
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,331
This is Sue McKinnon,
one of our dearest friends.

61
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:43,405
This is Jennifer, Eva's cousin.
She's come to visit us.

62
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:44,665
Jennifer Stewart.

63
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:49,538
The Beauregard Stewarts, of course.

64
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:53,581
My dear, I knew your mother very well.

65
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:54,941
You knew my mother?

66
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:59,648
When we were girls, Sally Stewart
and I were best friends.

67
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:01,889
You look like her.

68
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:03,651
You're favored that way.

69
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,488
But I'm not the girl--

70
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:07,287
My mother never lived here.

71
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:11,264
My, we did have frolics,
your mother and I.

72
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,132
You men!

73
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,105
Here's Sally Stewart's girl,
Jennifer.

74
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,336
It's nothing. Pay no attention.

75
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:26,243
Well, you must be Eva's cousin
I've been hearing so much about.

76
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,213
And this is Sue's brother, Ty.

77
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,683
He's a terrible flirt
and wicked as can be.

78
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:33,982
That's nice. I've always wanted
to meet somebody wicked.

79
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,786
I'm just a poor, scared little boy
that nobody understands, honey.

80
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:39,826
Don't say I didn't warn you.

81
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:43,761
And this is Eva's husband,
Avery Phillips, my brother.

82
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,367
They call me Beauty.

83
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:49,067
Well, well, you didn't faint
or even shudder.

84
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:50,365
Stop it, Beauty.

85
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:53,941
You can understand why I have
such a sickening nickname.

86
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:55,342
It's a joke.

87
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:58,208
I don't know
what you're talking about.

88
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,240
That's the way to handle him.

89
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,612
He uses that scar to terrify people.

90
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,082
You just ignore him.

91
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,955
Jennifer Stewart.

92
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,657
You come talk to me.

93
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:12,089
I'll regale you, child.

94
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:15,959
I'll tell you all the delicious scandal
I can think of around here.

95
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,794
Not all, I hope.

96
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:21,933
That scar is deeper
than it used to be, isn't it?

97
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:25,102
I'll try and act more like
a true Southern gentleman.

98
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:27,709
That would be a pleasant change.

99
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,244
It's like seeing Sally again.

100
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:32,608
So young and shining.

101
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:34,545
I like you already.

102
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:36,447
I hope Cousin Eva likes me.

103
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,986
My mother spoke of her so often.

104
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,051
Is she so very beautiful?

105
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:42,452
Eva?

106
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:45,919
Beautiful? You might say that.

107
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:48,794
You might very well say that.

108
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,193
It's in the eye of the beholder.

109
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,570
She is beautiful.

110
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,334
This is Jennifer's first trip
to the South.

111
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,408
Did you know that, Sue?

112
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,504
That's strange.

113
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:05,841
That's really very strange.

114
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:08,985
Your mother's family
were quality folk.

115
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:12,246
If you're really a Beauregard Stewart,
then you'd know--

116
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,219
Well, I've been waiting for this.

117
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:17,952
Now you're going to hear about
our notable Southern ancestors.

118
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:19,288
We all have them.

119
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:21,225
Why, child, let me tell you...

120
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:23,923
...your grandpappy fought
with Lee at Shiloh.

121
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:26,261
It was Chickamauga, I think.

122
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:30,065
I'll have you know, child,
that your grandpappy had 1000 slaves.

123
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:33,402
Your grandmammy never spoke to anyone
from further north...

124
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,011
...than Atlanta, G.A.

125
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:38,906
Georgia, that is. Sir!

126
00:08:39,315 --> 00:08:40,442
Sam!

127
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:42,509
Where are you, Sam?

128
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,212
Come and help me with my packages.

129
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:50,752
A delightful afternoon,
suddenly complete.

130
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,722
Is it--?

131
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,827
Your cousin, my dear wife.

132
00:08:58,034 --> 00:08:59,024
Eva.

133
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:01,964
Mommy's home!
Did you bring me something?

134
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:03,799
How about a kiss?

135
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:05,902
This is for you.

136
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:08,772
And you know something?
I forgot all about you.

137
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:12,680
Put those things in my room, please.

138
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,155
My, how cozy you all look!

139
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,255
Darling, is that for me?

140
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:27,195
How sweet!

141
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:29,694
Just give me a minute
to get my breath back.

142
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:34,163
There.

143
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,202
Now I'm ready for people.

144
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:39,335
Sue McKinnon, it's just ages.

145
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,239
We don't see enough of you
or your handsome brother.

146
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:44,073
Hello to both of you.

147
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,550
Carol, you look sweet...

148
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,219
...even in those tacky
old riding clothes.

149
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,080
Who are you, you pretty thing?

150
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:54,982
You look mighty like....

151
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:59,558
You must be Jennifer.

152
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:03,366
Of course, you are.
I'd recognize you anywhere.

153
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:07,363
I'm sorry I didn't meet you, but we
didn't know what train you were on.

154
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,267
That's all right. I'm used
to taking care of myself.

155
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:15,309
I have to entertain our company now.
But later we'll talk about you.

156
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:16,409
Are you going?

157
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:19,241
I was looking forward
to a long visit with you.

158
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,577
Some other time, I hope.
We're late now.

159
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:23,184
Goodbye, all.

160
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:26,254
It's been most enjoyable.
I do thank you.

161
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,981
Oh, here.

162
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:33,754
You are a good girl.

163
00:10:34,097 --> 00:10:36,896
- Walk out with me.
- The car's in back.

164
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,031
I hope you get a chance
to go over those papers.

165
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:48,544
You do favor your mother.

166
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:51,442
It pleasures me to see you.

167
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:01,786
She'll always think of you
as Sally Stewart's daughter.

168
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,088
I'll always think of you
as a very sweet girl.

169
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:12,433
You know, I'm kissing kin
with the Stewarts of Beauregard.

170
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,351
He's nice, isn't he?

171
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:38,218
Looks like Sue took a fancy to you.

172
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:41,329
You didn't mind her being
a little strange?

173
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:43,591
No, I liked her right away.

174
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,133
Did you hear?
Jennifer likes Sue enormously.

175
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:48,600
It's very nice of Jennifer.

176
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:50,702
Poor Sue.

177
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:52,375
She's our local legend.

178
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:55,067
Every town in the South has one.

179
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:58,345
Beautiful girl jilted
on her wedding day...

180
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:01,814
...still waiting for
her unfaithful lover to return.

181
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:05,580
Her unfaithful, uncaring
scoundrel of a lover.

182
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:08,223
I can't imagine anything
like that happening to her.

183
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:09,824
But it did.

184
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:13,590
The bridegroom-to-be
ran away with somebody else...

185
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,799
...and left poor Sue at
the door of the church...

186
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,968
...and she's been as she is
ever since:

187
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:23,230
A walking reproach
and a constant reminder of tragedy.

188
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:27,967
Eva, never come between
me and my liquor.

189
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:29,645
You'll get knocked down.

190
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,872
You might give Jennifer
the wrong impression.

191
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:35,142
My dear Jennifer,
don't get the wrong impression.

192
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:38,253
If I seem drunk, it's because I am.
My normal condition.

193
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:42,255
- I'm sure you don't mean to be rude--
- What makes you think that?

194
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,917
- Don't talk to me in that tone.
- I won't talk at all.

195
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:48,688
There's time to show you
the house before dinner.

196
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:50,696
I'd like that.
It's a beautiful house.

197
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,799
A beautiful house...

198
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,731
...beautiful people...

199
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:57,231
...in the eye of the beholder.

200
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:01,535
How dare you embarrass me like that?

201
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:03,076
Carol.

202
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,908
Please tell me,
was it because of me?

203
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,109
No, Jennifer.

204
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:11,150
Really, it wasn't.

205
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:17,484
But I feel responsible somehow.

206
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:23,996
It was my brother who left
Sue McKinnon at the church.

207
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:27,335
And the woman
he ran away with was...?

208
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,763
Eva.

209
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:31,736
I can't bear to see her.
What was she doing here?

210
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,500
Do you think I enjoyed it?

211
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,702
She feels guilty.
She's punishing herself.

212
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:39,883
Don't worry about it.
She'll be gentle.

213
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:43,052
I can endure the rest of it,
and I don't mind anything else.

214
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:45,585
Doesn't he understand?

215
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:48,887
Can't he realize how she must feel?

216
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:53,624
Carol, it must be terrible for Eva,
knowing what's happened to Sue.

217
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:56,128
Just seeing her that way.

218
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,558
He sees her too.

219
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:04,603
I'm to blame for everything.

220
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:08,242
If only you'd try
and understand what I feel.

221
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,049
Good morning.

222
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:52,216
- We have servants to carry things.
- It's breakfast for Eva.

223
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:54,083
They'll fix it.
Coffee for me, Sam.

224
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,259
Coffee for Mr. Phillips.

225
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,819
I like your new shoes.

226
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:04,394
How'd she know I got new shoes?

227
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,037
Morning, Avery.
I see you're out of hiding.

228
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,699
We haven't seen very much
of each other.

229
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:13,466
Is your name Jennifer?

230
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:17,204
- You've been away.
- No, I've been drunk in my rooms.

231
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:20,680
Jennifer's not interested
in your drinking.

232
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:24,752
Everybody's interested in my drinking.
It's rather remarkable sometimes.

233
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:26,388
Makes me a bad host.

234
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,058
I hope you've enjoyed your stay,
despite my absence.

235
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:30,419
Very much.

236
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:32,117
Thanks to Eva and Carol.

237
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:34,456
They've been wonderful to me.

238
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,064
Jen's very fond of Eva.

239
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:38,431
So many people are.

240
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:40,469
You don't care for me, though.

241
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:47,276
You don't tell polite,
social lies, I gather.

242
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:50,002
I don't blame Jennifer.
You've been rude to her.

243
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:51,305
Have I been very rude?

244
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:53,613
No, not very.

245
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:54,977
Good.

246
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:57,244
Then I don't have to apologize.

247
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,421
The children in town?

248
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:05,292
With Miss George.

249
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:08,157
I asked her not to come
back until after lunch.

250
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,067
Are you going hunting?

251
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:12,758
Not exactly.

252
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,732
I'm going to kill this dog.

253
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:24,203
- He isn't--
- The dog is old, sick and in pain.

254
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:26,882
Just moving is torture
for poor old Tiddly.

255
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,609
But how can your brother take
that little dog?

256
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:31,913
He'll start drinking again.

257
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:35,216
But he can't bear
to see an animal suffer.

258
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:36,653
He loves them so.

259
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,522
Sometimes I think
more than people even.

260
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:41,488
Does she know?

261
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:45,428
We'll tell her the dog died
in its sleep. And I said "we."

262
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,262
I don't like lying.

263
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,929
Eva would rather be lied to
than know the truth.

264
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:54,938
You do hate her, don't you?

265
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:56,404
Of course.

266
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:05,648
Eva.

267
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:26,265
You've brought me my coffee.

268
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:28,572
How nice you are!

269
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:31,307
No, not yet.

270
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:39,955
Don't stand there staring at me
and looking so ridiculously young.

271
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:42,421
Go away for a minute.

272
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,219
Put it down over there. Anywhere.

273
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:46,895
I'll open the shutters.

274
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:51,033
And let in all that nasty light?
No, darling.

275
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,763
Not until I get ready for the day.

276
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:55,562
I hope it is a day.

277
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:58,038
I'll get my robe.

278
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:06,112
Well, do I look fairly human?

279
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,339
Lovely.

280
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,782
Then you can bring my coffee
and open the shutters.

281
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:17,023
Thank you.

282
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:22,698
I feel guilty about neglecting you
these last few days.

283
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:24,992
That's okay.
I know how busy you've been.

284
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:27,932
And Carol's been taking me everywhere.

285
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:30,672
You like Carol?

286
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:32,138
Very much.

287
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,238
She doesn't have many friends.

288
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:37,936
Her personality, I suppose.
She doesn't even like me.

289
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,520
It's probably Beauty.

290
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:49,123
I've asked him not
to hunt near the house...

291
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:50,884
...but he won't listen to me.

292
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:52,584
You and he must have...

293
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:56,396
...loved each other a great deal,
running off together that way.

294
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:01,237
He was mad about me. Simply mad.

295
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,929
And I was worse, much worse.

296
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:06,839
I knew I couldn't live without him.

297
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:09,212
I knew that right away.

298
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,075
And it's never changed...

299
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:14,342
...not with me.

300
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:22,490
I admire you so much.

301
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:24,852
You're so nice...

302
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:28,060
...in spite of the way things are.

303
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,962
I believe you're being sympathetic.

304
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:34,369
Don't feel sorry for me.

305
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:37,764
I like people around me
to laugh and be gay.

306
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:42,436
Oh, dear, it's getting very late.

307
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:44,807
Be an angel
and run my tub for me.

308
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:46,744
I like it very hot.

309
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:56,850
I'll get it.

310
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:03,360
Oh, it's you.

311
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,833
You never call me. Simply never.

312
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:10,973
Don't tell me you're finally going
to succumb to my fatal charm?

313
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:13,501
What?

314
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:17,310
Well, I'm simply bursting
with jealousy.

315
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:22,681
You'll have to bribe me, Ty.
That's all there is to it.

316
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:29,589
No, something large
and terribly expensive.

317
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:33,754
And I have to know
everything that happens.

318
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:35,124
Promise now?

319
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:38,199
I'll see what I can do. Bye.

320
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,392
- I can't take this.
- Of course you can.

321
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:41,934
You know who that was?

322
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:43,969
It was Ty McKinnon calling about you.

323
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:45,197
Why?

324
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,672
He wants my permission to beau you.

325
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:50,505
He wants to be your beau.
Your fella!

326
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:52,238
Shouldn't he have asked me?

327
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:55,111
He will now.
I gave him permission.

328
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:57,252
Oh, I just love it!

329
00:20:57,486 --> 00:20:59,352
He's the most eligible man around.

330
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:01,080
Isn't it exciting?

331
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,054
Aren't you excited?

332
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:04,487
Aren't we rushing him?

333
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:06,059
Make up your mind.

334
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:09,425
Decide you want the best things
out of life and go get them.

335
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:11,099
You can, you know.

336
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,734
Any woman can.

337
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:15,336
You can get anything you want.

338
00:21:15,537 --> 00:21:17,301
Even Ty McKinnon.

339
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:20,704
But Eva, I don't think
I want anything.

340
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:23,401
Every woman wants something.

341
00:21:24,713 --> 00:21:26,204
Not me, Eva.

342
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,849
I guess I'm different.

343
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,643
I don't want anything.

344
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:49,469
For you, Miss Jennifer.

345
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:52,072
From Mr. McKinnon, the boy said.

346
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:56,507
I hear Ty's being rounded up for
branding. Apparently, he's willing.

347
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,406
It's mostly Eva's idea.

348
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:01,448
Eva has the instincts
of a headhunter.

349
00:22:01,717 --> 00:22:05,586
It's very sweet of her to go
to so much trouble just for me.

350
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,816
You have such nice eyes.

351
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,853
A little small, perhaps,
and certainly not wide open.

352
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,328
I wonder how they'll look
when they're wide open.

353
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,263
Eva does it better.

354
00:22:55,838 --> 00:22:57,807
She does everything better.

355
00:22:58,006 --> 00:22:59,201
I'll do that.

356
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:00,535
You're very kind.

357
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:02,210
Not always.

358
00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:05,173
You may not believe it,
but I can be nasty.

359
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,144
Like the other day.

360
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:09,341
We didn't meet the other day.

361
00:23:09,818 --> 00:23:11,582
Do you know who I am?

362
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:13,483
Judson Prentiss.

363
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:16,181
You take care of the mills
for Mr. Phillips.

364
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:20,089
You don't come here often,
but you and Carol are secretly engaged.

365
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:22,287
You forgot to mention my middle name.

366
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:24,296
I don't know what it is.

367
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:27,133
At least I have one secret from you.

368
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:30,195
I couldn't help listening to you
the other day.

369
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:32,203
You didn't seem to care who heard you.

370
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:33,636
That's right.

371
00:23:36,178 --> 00:23:39,808
It doesn't matter to me
whether anyone else knows or not.

372
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:42,678
It's Carol who's dead set
on keeping it quiet.

373
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:43,944
Mostly from Eva.

374
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:45,846
I won't tell her...

375
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:47,545
...if that's what you're asking me.

376
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:50,020
That's what I'm asking you, all right.

377
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:53,093
Jud, darling.

378
00:23:53,295 --> 00:23:54,524
You've come back.

379
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:57,765
You've actually come back.

380
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,170
I've just been getting acquainted
with your cousin.

381
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:05,371
I didn't see you.
You're so quiet.

382
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:07,566
We'll have to put a bell on you.

383
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:09,767
Do sit down.

384
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:12,345
I've never thought of you
as a gentleman.

385
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:14,808
I hope you're able to
stay with us awhile.

386
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:16,842
I'm spending the night.

387
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:19,213
Avery wants me to go over
some business tomorrow.

388
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,881
Nobody told me.

389
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:26,528
I'm supposed to go out to dinner
tonight. Isn't that terrible?

390
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:29,658
It would have been nice
spending the evening with you.

391
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,390
Like old times.

392
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,635
The wonderful old times.

393
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,460
Jen.

394
00:24:36,672 --> 00:24:38,436
You must learn to join in conversations.

395
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,576
Otherwise, you give
such a mousy impression.

396
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:45,005
But you look nice
in the dress I bought you.

397
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:46,307
It is nice.

398
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:48,006
Thank you.

399
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:50,348
But it's really not like me.

400
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:52,578
Then you be like the dress.

401
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:55,914
Nobody wears these things anymore.

402
00:24:57,593 --> 00:25:00,358
That's Ty.
He always drives in the back way.

403
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:01,928
Hold still.

404
00:25:02,698 --> 00:25:04,860
Your gentleman caller, Miss Jen.

405
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:13,274
There.

406
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:18,636
You go out that way now.
And have a lovely, lovely evening.

407
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:22,544
And don't forget! Smile a lot.
Make character with people.

408
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:31,723
How young and lovely she is.

409
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:34,553
And how you hate her for it.

410
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:52,447
Mrs. Goff, please.
Mrs. Phillips calling.

411
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,579
She gives the worst dinners.
Serves health foods.

412
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:59,414
She's such a hypochondriac.

413
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:00,748
Natalie, darling.

414
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:02,855
A terrible thing happened.

415
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:04,583
My dog, Tiddly, remember?

416
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:07,194
She died in her sleep,
and I've been so upset.

417
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:09,729
I'm an absolute prey to disease.

418
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:12,298
Virus, the doctor says.

419
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,032
What, darling?

420
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:18,474
I can hardly hear you.

421
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:24,105
But I'm determined to
drag myself to your party.

422
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,415
Do you really think I should?

423
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:35,787
Of course, if you don't want me.

424
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:38,955
All right.

425
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:41,930
Then I'll go back to bed.

426
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,794
All right. Bye, now.

427
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:52,899
Now I can stay home
and enjoy your company.

428
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:57,205
Aren't I wicked?

429
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:00,278
Yes, as a matter of fact, you are.

430
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,654
Have a nice time?

431
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:08,983
It was a frolic.

432
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:11,558
- Is that the right word?
- It certainly is.

433
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,887
"Frolic" means...

434
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:15,087
...anything real nice.

435
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:18,489
Like this.

436
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:28,234
I'll call you tomorrow.
We'll start all over.

437
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:32,908
It's incredible.

438
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:36,274
Absolutely incredible!

439
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:43,285
You're just in time to hear the news.

440
00:27:43,492 --> 00:27:45,017
Such exciting news.

441
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:46,889
Carol and Jud, they're engaged.

442
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:48,324
Getting married.

443
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,624
Jud's just told us this minute.

444
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:53,927
Isn't it revolting that
he's only just told us?

445
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:56,628
I asked you not to do it this way, Jud.

446
00:27:56,838 --> 00:27:58,704
I didn't want anyone to know yet.

447
00:27:58,907 --> 00:27:59,931
I had to.

448
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:01,474
I'm fed up.
I've had enough.

449
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:02,609
Enough of what?

450
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,439
The deal Carol's getting.

451
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,614
I don't like the deal she's getting.

452
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:08,340
You know what I'm talking about.

453
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:10,580
Go to bed, Carol.

454
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:12,084
You too, Jud.

455
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:14,853
We'll talk more about it tomorrow.

456
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:16,547
By all means.

457
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:19,227
We will have a talk, won't we, Jud?

458
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:21,392
Like old times.

459
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:24,395
- There's nothing to discuss.
- I think we should talk.

460
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,568
I don't like to insist.

461
00:28:26,768 --> 00:28:28,498
But I insist.

462
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:30,933
All right.

463
00:28:38,046 --> 00:28:40,208
I expect you to do something about this.

464
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:43,385
It's natural for Carol to want to
marry and have a place of her own.

465
00:28:46,922 --> 00:28:48,220
I'm not so sure.

466
00:28:48,423 --> 00:28:49,550
Of what?

467
00:28:49,758 --> 00:28:51,727
That she will get married.

468
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:56,688
This can't be very amusing for you.

469
00:28:56,898 --> 00:28:59,299
Come and tell me all about your evening.

470
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:40,537
Is there anything I can do?

471
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:52,412
I never get used to it...

472
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:55,419
...even though it happens so often.

473
00:29:55,624 --> 00:29:59,459
He dreams the same dream
over and over again.

474
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:06,060
He's in the car, and
it starts down the driveway.

475
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,700
It's dark in his dream, he says.

476
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:12,369
And the car starts going
faster and faster.

477
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:16,272
He sees the mountains
coming nearer, nearer.

478
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,676
He sees the mountain?

479
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:22,477
That's all there is.

480
00:30:23,118 --> 00:30:25,110
Before the car reaches the mountain...

481
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,414
...he screams and wakes up.

482
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:30,617
He says when they reach the mountain...

483
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:32,225
...they'll die.

484
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:35,321
I wonder what it means.

485
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:40,528
Do you know who's with him
in the car in his dream?

486
00:30:44,406 --> 00:30:45,567
Eva.

487
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:48,867
You seem to blame everything on her--

488
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:50,636
Stay here long enough.

489
00:30:50,845 --> 00:30:51,869
You'll find out.

490
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,276
She's sweet with him.
It wouldn't have to do with her.

491
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:58,249
She's sweet, all right.
She's sweet with everybody.

492
00:30:58,453 --> 00:31:00,922
Just like she was tonight with me.

493
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:03,950
Has it occurred to you
Eva might be worried...

494
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,492
...about Jud being good enough for you?

495
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:12,460
She's worried about anyone
getting away from her.

496
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,829
She's so unhappy,
she can't bear the idea...

497
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:16,766
...of someone living a normal life.

498
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:20,773
- I don't want to hear any more.
- I used to wonder about Eva...

499
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:23,034
...until I read a book about bees.

500
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:24,936
Now this is ridiculous.

501
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:27,909
We used to keep bees for the orchard.

502
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:30,745
There's a whole chapter
devoted to the queen...

503
00:31:30,952 --> 00:31:32,921
...the ruler of a hive.

504
00:31:33,188 --> 00:31:35,020
The queen bee...

505
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:37,856
...who stings all her rivals to death.

506
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:39,322
I won't listen--

507
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:41,325
Your turn'll come.

508
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:43,657
She'll sting you one day.

509
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:46,863
Ever so gently...

510
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:49,560
...so you hardly even feel it.

511
00:31:50,572 --> 00:31:52,438
Till you fall dead.

512
00:31:54,476 --> 00:31:56,775
You want me to hate her,
like you do.

513
00:31:56,978 --> 00:31:58,640
After all she's done for me.

514
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:00,873
She's never done anything for you.

515
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:03,813
It was my brother. He paid your
bills, put you through school.

516
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,181
Eva asked me to come down here.

517
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:09,790
She probably thought it'd be
cheaper than hiring a secretary.

518
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:15,023
I didn't mean that.

519
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,731
She is fond of you.

520
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:21,227
And while it lasts,
she can be very charming.

521
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:24,768
I just don't want her laughing at you.

522
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:26,942
I'm sorry, Jennifer.

523
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:30,878
Don't be sorry for me.

524
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,639
Be sorry for yourself,
feeling the way you do...

525
00:32:33,848 --> 00:32:35,908
...about a wonderful person like Eva.

526
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,488
That book on bees...

527
00:32:40,488 --> 00:32:42,354
...it's in the library.

528
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:45,418
You might read it one day.

529
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:27,995
Jud?

530
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:30,872
Darling, are you here?

531
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:33,473
I'm here.

532
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,103
You knew I'd be here.

533
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:40,715
Of course, I did.

534
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:44,575
But I remember too, you never liked
being taken for granted.

535
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,220
It's been so long.

536
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:48,617
It'll be longer.

537
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:52,726
Stop teasing and come here to me...

538
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:55,294
...before another minute goes by.

539
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,592
It's no good, Eva.

540
00:33:58,366 --> 00:34:00,267
I'm going to marry Carol.

541
00:34:02,937 --> 00:34:04,303
Are you, darling?

542
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,309
Are you really?

543
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:11,536
You might as well save the charm.

544
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,140
You're out of my blood.
I've forgotten you.

545
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:16,284
I can look Avery in the face again.

546
00:34:16,484 --> 00:34:18,578
And I'm going to marry Carol.

547
00:34:21,256 --> 00:34:23,225
I'm not out of your blood.

548
00:34:24,492 --> 00:34:26,552
And you haven't forgotten me.

549
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:29,225
Not completely.

550
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:32,600
Never completely.

551
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:36,099
I'll make you remember me.

552
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,378
It's like old times.

553
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:05,628
I don't like the lights.

554
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,599
I remember what you like
and what you don't like.

555
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,501
Turn them out again.

556
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:15,568
You're something.

557
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:17,707
You're really something.

558
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:19,844
You never give up, do you?

559
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:22,684
Well, give up with me, Eva.

560
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,751
Don't tell me you've developed
a set of finer instincts since Chicago.

561
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,688
That was ten years ago.

562
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:33,122
Long ago...

563
00:35:33,328 --> 00:35:35,126
...and far away.

564
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:37,160
I'm grown-up now.

565
00:35:37,432 --> 00:35:39,628
I grew up when you married Avery.

566
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:42,735
Don't forget, you introduced us.

567
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:45,338
I mention that to myself occasionally.

568
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:49,975
It was rough getting you out
of my little round head.

569
00:35:50,178 --> 00:35:52,340
But I worked at it, and you're gone.

570
00:35:52,847 --> 00:35:55,476
I'm in love with Carol,
and we'll be married.

571
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,621
- Then why did you meet me here?
- To tell you that.

572
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:01,756
And to talk over old times.

573
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:03,015
The wonderful...

574
00:36:03,224 --> 00:36:05,056
...dead old times.

575
00:36:08,997 --> 00:36:10,056
Jud?

576
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:16,364
Isn't there anything left of us?

577
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:20,139
You're like some fancy kind of disease.

578
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:25,942
I had it once. Now I'm immune.

579
00:36:29,717 --> 00:36:32,118
I'll make you sorry for this.

580
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:33,587
Will you?

581
00:36:33,788 --> 00:36:35,757
You know I will.

582
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:49,863
Naturally, I've been anxious...

583
00:36:50,104 --> 00:36:53,768
...but you've relieved my mind
tremendously, Doctor.

584
00:36:54,776 --> 00:36:56,802
It's a difficult situation...

585
00:36:57,011 --> 00:37:00,448
...but not entirely strange
to a psychiatrist.

586
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:02,777
I admire you professional men.

587
00:37:02,984 --> 00:37:05,044
Such strength of mind.

588
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,415
Well, we're not entirely...

589
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:10,989
...unimpressionable, Mrs. Phillips.

590
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:12,455
Is someone sick?

591
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,559
Not exactly.

592
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:14,854
This is Doctor....

593
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,167
Pearson.
The famous Dr. Pearson.

594
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:20,562
How do you do?

595
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,102
He's here about Ted
and those dreadful nightmares.

596
00:37:24,605 --> 00:37:26,540
It's most unfortunate.

597
00:37:26,808 --> 00:37:28,606
I hope you'll follow my advice.

598
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,176
I will.
Believe me, I will.

599
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:32,040
And right away, too.

600
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:33,537
Jen?

601
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:37,014
Would you call Miss George
from the library, please?

602
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:41,150
You're so kind and helpful.

603
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:44,048
It's been my pleasure.

604
00:37:44,258 --> 00:37:45,590
Entirely.

605
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,229
Miss George.

606
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:52,332
Would you please come to the library?

607
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:54,331
Mrs. Phillips, yes.

608
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:07,211
Really, that Dr. Pearson.
He's so absurd.

609
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:10,442
He actually trembles when I talk to him.

610
00:38:11,886 --> 00:38:14,947
You'd think he'd never seen
a beautiful woman before.

611
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:22,120
What were you reading?

612
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,359
A book about bees.

613
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:30,466
A sad little book, all about bees.

614
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:32,637
Aren't you quaint!

615
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:36,102
Imagine anyone caring about bees.

616
00:38:39,147 --> 00:38:43,608
You must think me terribly vain,
always staring at myself in mirrors.

617
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,587
I was just thinking
how beautiful you are.

618
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:50,923
How very beautiful.

619
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:53,523
Aren't you nice!

620
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:57,095
You're as flattering as Dr. Pearson.

621
00:38:57,298 --> 00:38:58,698
What did he say?

622
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,267
The most extravagant things.

623
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,233
About Ted.

624
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,309
Just what I've always said.

625
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:12,008
It's Carol who's responsible
for his nightmares.

626
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:13,545
He said that?

627
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:17,247
- Why should he say that?
- You know how neurotic she is.

628
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:20,183
Since this engagement,
she's even worse.

629
00:39:20,388 --> 00:39:23,017
She's so possessive and clinging.

630
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:25,192
But she loves Ted.

631
00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:28,591
- That's what he needs.
- Did you ring for Miss George?

632
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:31,125
Then where is she?

633
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:34,163
Carol is very sweet with Ted.

634
00:39:34,368 --> 00:39:37,532
- Why does the doctor blame her?
- It's just not normal.

635
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:41,937
She's smothering the child with
affection, making him dependent on her.

636
00:39:42,143 --> 00:39:43,634
He says it's...

637
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:46,004
...unnatural.

638
00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:47,382
There you are!

639
00:39:47,582 --> 00:39:50,711
- You wanted me?
- I've been wanting you for some time.

640
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:54,047
Have Sam and one of the stable men
come up to Carol's room.

641
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:56,588
Tell them to bring boxes.
We're moving her things.

642
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:01,153
But Miss Carol's been in that room
since she was a child.

643
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:05,522
From now on she'll be in the other wing,
next to Mr. Phillips.

644
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:09,597
Won't Carol wonder
why you're moving her?

645
00:40:09,937 --> 00:40:10,905
Of course.

646
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:14,564
And naturally she'll think
I'm doing it just to hurt her.

647
00:40:14,775 --> 00:40:17,335
She gets such weird ideas.

648
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:19,070
She'll be leaving soon.

649
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:22,745
Wouldn't it be better to wait
until she and Jud are married?

650
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:25,711
That may be a long wait.

651
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:29,990
Wasn't he the handsomest thing
before that scar?

652
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:33,652
Was it some kind of accident?

653
00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:36,157
Automobile.

654
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:37,730
I was with him.

655
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:41,225
He was drinking heavily.

656
00:40:42,803 --> 00:40:44,772
I'd rather not talk about it.

657
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,447
If you only knew how I've ached
to clear out this room.

658
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:57,182
How did you meet each other?

659
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,517
I arranged it.

660
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:05,084
Isn't that naughty to admit
something like that?

661
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:07,421
I was perfectly bold about it.

662
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:11,355
I guess you have to be bold
to get what you want.

663
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,727
That's the only way, darling.

664
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:18,501
When you see something you want,
grab it.

665
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:21,642
That's how I got
Mr. Avery Phillips Ill.

666
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:24,244
It happened in Chicago.

667
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:27,979
He came north with Jud Prentiss.

668
00:41:28,182 --> 00:41:29,411
You know Jud.

669
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:33,381
He had some silly ideas about us.

670
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:34,419
Jud did.

671
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:36,056
Maybe I did too.

672
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:39,420
But it was over when I met Avery.

673
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:41,687
Over and done with.

674
00:41:42,763 --> 00:41:44,823
I followed him down here...

675
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:49,569
...and after a while, we were married.

676
00:41:51,072 --> 00:41:53,337
Then is when the trouble started...

677
00:41:54,308 --> 00:41:55,674
...with Carol...

678
00:41:56,143 --> 00:41:57,475
...and Sue...

679
00:41:58,012 --> 00:41:59,571
...and all the others.

680
00:42:01,515 --> 00:42:03,143
I'm an outsider.

681
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:05,377
And they hate outsiders.

682
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:07,986
They're polite enough.
That's how they are.

683
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:15,055
You don't know the things they've
made me do trying to protect myself.

684
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:20,566
And how ashamed I've been sometimes
because of them.

685
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,734
You don't know how they are.

686
00:42:26,507 --> 00:42:28,169
But you'll find out.

687
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:30,576
As I have.

688
00:42:31,379 --> 00:42:32,608
How they whisper...

689
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:33,746
...talk about you...

690
00:42:33,948 --> 00:42:35,007
...laugh!

691
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,915
As if you have to be from the South
to be any good.

692
00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:46,361
They're so smug...

693
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:48,586
...and namby-pamby.

694
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:55,133
I wish I could get rid of them
as easy as this trash.

695
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,011
I did get carried away, didn't I?

696
00:43:08,015 --> 00:43:09,847
Whatever will you think of me?

697
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:12,479
Not that I blame you.

698
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,921
I don't know when I've been
in such a temper.

699
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,126
They say it's good to get things
out of your system.

700
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:27,334
There's no point...

701
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:29,595
...in overdoing it now, is there?

702
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:41,979
You're not thinking
bad thoughts about me, are you?

703
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:46,116
I'm feeling sorry for you.

704
00:43:46,787 --> 00:43:48,449
That's not nice.

705
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:50,918
I don't like that.

706
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:53,357
It's a bad thought.

707
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:57,332
I don't want you ever
to think bad thoughts about me.

708
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:58,521
Not you.

709
00:43:58,933 --> 00:44:00,697
Don't hate Carol so much.

710
00:44:00,901 --> 00:44:04,338
Let her leave without making her
unhappy, and yourself as well.

711
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:06,700
Don't oppose me, Jennifer.

712
00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:10,110
Everyone else does.

713
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:13,704
It makes me terribly cross
when people oppose me.

714
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:18,519
I've been thinking.

715
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:20,654
Perhaps I ought to leave.

716
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,349
You'd leave me?

717
00:44:25,426 --> 00:44:26,792
Go away...

718
00:44:28,095 --> 00:44:30,155
...when I need you so badly?

719
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:36,230
You've seen how things are here...

720
00:44:37,972 --> 00:44:40,567
...and what I have to put up with.

721
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:47,305
And you'd leave me all alone here...

722
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:49,707
...just when I've gotten used to you.

723
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:51,317
Please, try to understand.

724
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,182
I am trying.
I'm trying very hard.

725
00:44:55,356 --> 00:44:58,258
If there's one thing I detest,
it's selfishness.

726
00:44:59,894 --> 00:45:03,763
I won't remind you what I've done
for you, and I don't expect gratitude.

727
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:05,330
You know I'm grateful.

728
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:07,297
Then stay with me.

729
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:09,695
Don't frighten me like this.

730
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:14,072
If you left, I wouldn't have
anyone to call my own.

731
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:16,700
Promise me you'll stay.

732
00:45:17,545 --> 00:45:19,605
I can't hurt you, Eva.

733
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:23,043
I'd never be able to hurt you.

734
00:45:24,285 --> 00:45:26,777
You gave me such a terrible moment.

735
00:45:26,987 --> 00:45:29,081
Aren't you ashamed to frighten me?

736
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,918
I didn't mean to.

737
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:36,219
We'll never talk
about you leaving again.

738
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,454
Not ever again.

739
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:03,617
You came to quarrel with me
about my drinking?

740
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:07,861
You aren't even going to ask me
to give it up?

741
00:46:10,297 --> 00:46:11,925
In that case...

742
00:46:12,266 --> 00:46:13,234
...come in.

743
00:46:27,414 --> 00:46:28,973
What's the occasion?

744
00:46:29,483 --> 00:46:32,749
Curious to see the household freak
in his native lair?

745
00:46:32,953 --> 00:46:36,754
You said you wondered how my eyes
would look when they were wide open.

746
00:46:36,957 --> 00:46:39,085
So that's the occasion.

747
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,288
The bloom is off the rose,
the butterfly has lost its wings.

748
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:47,331
And there are holes
in the image of Eva.

749
00:46:48,168 --> 00:46:50,728
Large holes? Small ones?

750
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,439
Large.

751
00:46:53,874 --> 00:46:55,706
That's the way it goes.

752
00:46:56,877 --> 00:46:59,574
You are disenchanted with Eva.

753
00:47:01,615 --> 00:47:03,516
I'm married to her.

754
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:06,744
- She told me how you were married.
- I doubt it.

755
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:09,048
The real version is rather ugly.

756
00:47:13,227 --> 00:47:15,219
I met her in Chicago
on a business trip.

757
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:18,866
We loved each other. It was
slightly insane then it was over.

758
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:23,197
But Eva doesn't believe in goodbyes.

759
00:47:23,604 --> 00:47:25,937
She told me a convincing,
old-fashioned lie.

760
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:31,044
It was frantic, appealing and wistful.
I fancied myself a decent man.

761
00:47:31,312 --> 00:47:35,443
Within a week, I knew I'd been gulled
like a hayseed at a carnival.

762
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:37,743
You could have broken away.

763
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:43,152
Very sensible suggestion.

764
00:47:45,025 --> 00:47:48,086
We even discussed the possibility
on one occasion...

765
00:47:48,662 --> 00:47:50,324
...in an automobile.

766
00:47:51,932 --> 00:47:53,833
It was a short discussion.

767
00:47:55,603 --> 00:47:58,539
I found out I was to be a family man.
Since I'm old-fashioned...

768
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:02,506
...we've been happily married ever
since, like in the storybooks.

769
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:05,636
I found the perfect escape
from literature.

770
00:48:05,846 --> 00:48:08,611
All I have to cope with now
is a hangover.

771
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:11,217
I've come to you for help.

772
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:16,279
Me?

773
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:19,849
That's amusing.

774
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,120
Eva's trying to stop Carol's marriage.

775
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:24,889
Predictable, for various reasons.

776
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:29,031
You can't just hide away in here
and let it happen.

777
00:48:30,771 --> 00:48:33,138
I wish you'd never come to this house.

778
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:37,704
I'm sorry you don't like me.

779
00:48:46,787 --> 00:48:48,688
I'll do what I can about Eva.

780
00:48:49,356 --> 00:48:52,190
I've never been able to do much,
but I'll do what I can.

781
00:48:52,593 --> 00:48:54,858
I'll come out of hiding
and be down for dinner.

782
00:48:55,062 --> 00:48:57,725
I'll talk to Carol, Jud and Eva,
if necessary.

783
00:48:57,931 --> 00:48:59,763
Is that what you want?

784
00:48:59,967 --> 00:49:01,799
That's not everything.

785
00:49:03,003 --> 00:49:05,199
I wish I could help you.

786
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:09,870
I wish you'd try and like me,
just a little.

787
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:25,052
I'm not much good, and that's a fact.

788
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,292
Sorry.

789
00:49:29,997 --> 00:49:32,626
- But you mustn't--
- Get away from me!

790
00:50:05,365 --> 00:50:07,129
I thought you were aware by now...

791
00:50:07,334 --> 00:50:10,236
...I'm not someone to be sent for,
like a kitchen maid.

792
00:50:10,437 --> 00:50:13,703
Are you drunker than usual, or
have you lost all sense of courtesy?

793
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:16,467
I'm making a rare appearance
as head of the house.

794
00:50:16,677 --> 00:50:17,906
Quite an occasion!

795
00:50:18,612 --> 00:50:21,980
- And what am I supposed to be?
- We won't go into that.

796
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:23,648
Sit down.

797
00:50:24,418 --> 00:50:26,319
Sit down, my dear.

798
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:37,528
I've been discussing things with
Carol and Jud. I've made a decision.

799
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:39,163
Really?

800
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,528
A whole decision, all by yourself?

801
00:50:41,735 --> 00:50:43,260
I won't argue with you.

802
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,935
I don't believe in long engagements.

803
00:50:47,374 --> 00:50:50,105
I can't very well argue
against that.

804
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,712
We didn't have a long engagement,
and look how idyllic we are.

805
00:50:54,248 --> 00:50:55,580
Exactly.

806
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:59,280
They're willing to get married
immediately, and I've asked them to.

807
00:51:03,056 --> 00:51:05,651
I'm very happy for both of them.

808
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:08,587
Thrilled, in fact.

809
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:11,758
We knew we could count
on your blessing.

810
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,035
There's just one little thing.

811
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:20,302
I know it sounds terrible...

812
00:51:21,074 --> 00:51:24,602
...but with everything happening
so quickly, won't people wonder?

813
00:51:24,812 --> 00:51:26,303
And talk?

814
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,812
People will talk, you know.

815
00:51:29,016 --> 00:51:31,315
Without reason, of course.

816
00:51:33,387 --> 00:51:36,118
There isn't any reason, is there?

817
00:51:37,558 --> 00:51:39,049
No, Eva.

818
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,157
Not the way you mean.

819
00:51:42,129 --> 00:51:44,257
This may come as
a surprise to you...

820
00:51:44,464 --> 00:51:48,731
...but the only reason we're marrying
is because we love each other.

821
00:51:55,642 --> 00:51:57,736
Just thought I'd ask.

822
00:51:58,278 --> 00:51:59,940
You know how people are.

823
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:03,948
- Whatever you are, Eva, you're--
- The matter is settled.

824
00:52:05,786 --> 00:52:08,119
The wedding will take place on Sunday.

825
00:52:09,723 --> 00:52:11,282
Of course, darling.

826
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:13,621
Whatever you say.

827
00:52:18,432 --> 00:52:21,061
Now you can go back to your drinking.

828
00:52:21,735 --> 00:52:23,897
It'll make you feel more at home.

829
00:52:30,544 --> 00:52:31,944
You should've been here.

830
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:35,081
Beauty's been making decisions
all by himself.

831
00:52:35,282 --> 00:52:38,047
About Carol and Jud.
They're getting married right away.

832
00:52:38,252 --> 00:52:40,778
That's wonderful!
I was hoping they wouldn't wait.

833
00:52:40,988 --> 00:52:43,753
I'm so happy for them.
I don't know--

834
00:53:09,383 --> 00:53:11,784
The wedding supper. How sweet!

835
00:53:12,452 --> 00:53:16,548
And how I detest not being with you,
tonight of all nights.

836
00:53:17,124 --> 00:53:18,251
Where's Jen?

837
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:19,687
In her room.

838
00:53:19,893 --> 00:53:21,486
She's not feeling well.

839
00:53:21,695 --> 00:53:23,755
It's all this excitement.

840
00:53:23,964 --> 00:53:25,933
It's too much for her.

841
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,731
It's almost too much for me.

842
00:53:29,703 --> 00:53:33,435
The Aherns' party will seem dull
compared to this.

843
00:53:34,174 --> 00:53:36,075
I wish they hadn't insisted
on my coming.

844
00:53:36,276 --> 00:53:39,144
It was very inconsiderate of them.
But what can I do?

845
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:40,473
You could stay home.

846
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:42,547
And miss a party?

847
00:53:43,383 --> 00:53:47,081
Darling, a party is to women
what a battlefield is to men.

848
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:50,121
I forgot. You weren't in the army,
were you?

849
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:52,987
Something about drinking, wasn't it?

850
00:53:53,193 --> 00:53:55,185
You'll miss the party.

851
00:53:59,366 --> 00:54:02,165
They're terribly disappointed
that you aren't coming.

852
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:03,962
I told them you had the virus.

853
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:07,335
Just a touch,
but enough to keep you at home.

854
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:08,770
Wasn't that clever of me?

855
00:54:08,976 --> 00:54:11,810
Whatever lie you told them,
I'm sure it was expert.

856
00:54:12,012 --> 00:54:14,106
You're priceless. Really, you are.

857
00:54:14,314 --> 00:54:16,249
I like you much better this way...

858
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:19,515
...than the usual way.

859
00:54:24,825 --> 00:54:27,852
My, isn't she strange?

860
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:30,562
Nervous, I suppose.

861
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:34,291
I was nervous before our wedding too.

862
00:54:34,501 --> 00:54:36,663
How well I remember!

863
00:54:37,004 --> 00:54:40,304
Here I am, chattering away,
and it's getting late.

864
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:43,374
I hate to ask,
but I've lost my car keys.

865
00:54:43,577 --> 00:54:45,876
I'm afraid you'll have
to drive me to the Aherns'.

866
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,072
How can I?
I'm locked in my room with the virus.

867
00:54:49,282 --> 00:54:51,649
- Drive me in.
- Take my car.

868
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:53,411
That heavy thing?

869
00:54:54,087 --> 00:54:55,453
It drags my arms.

870
00:54:55,655 --> 00:54:58,318
I'd be a wreck before I got there.

871
00:54:58,525 --> 00:55:00,255
You'll drive me.

872
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:07,828
Jud, darling.

873
00:55:08,035 --> 00:55:09,469
I hate to beg.

874
00:55:10,404 --> 00:55:11,895
But you can see how it is.

875
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:15,507
I won't keep you long, and
you can be back in less than an hour.

876
00:55:15,709 --> 00:55:17,234
Please?

877
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,575
You will drive me in.

878
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:25,017
After I've had a drink.

879
00:55:25,218 --> 00:55:27,119
You are a sweet thing.

880
00:55:28,088 --> 00:55:29,613
I knew you would.

881
00:55:30,223 --> 00:55:32,556
You never could refuse me,
could you?

882
00:55:35,529 --> 00:55:38,226
Don't be long.
I'll get my purse.

883
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:46,667
I know about you, Jud.

884
00:55:46,873 --> 00:55:48,364
About you and Eva.

885
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:53,104
I've known for a long time.

886
00:55:54,848 --> 00:55:57,249
Then you know it was over
when you married her.

887
00:55:57,451 --> 00:55:59,010
I was making sure...

888
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:00,346
...because of Carol.

889
00:56:00,554 --> 00:56:01,988
That's fair enough.

890
00:56:02,189 --> 00:56:05,591
I've had the impression you find it
hard to look me in the eyes.

891
00:56:08,228 --> 00:56:09,787
I'm looking now.

892
00:56:10,397 --> 00:56:11,956
What do you think?

893
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:15,228
She's been after you, hasn't she?

894
00:56:21,508 --> 00:56:23,204
And not only you.

895
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,937
- You stay locked in your room.
- I'm out of my room.

896
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:29,679
I guess you are.

897
00:56:30,217 --> 00:56:32,812
Have you told Carol
about knowing Eva?

898
00:56:35,322 --> 00:56:36,585
Are you going to?

899
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,983
You be noble and tell her.

900
00:56:39,192 --> 00:56:41,320
You break her heart.
I want her to be happy.

901
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:43,656
Someone in this house
deserves to be happy.

902
00:56:43,864 --> 00:56:47,323
If all it takes is me not saying
anything, that's all right with me.

903
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:49,698
How is it with you?

904
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,098
I want her to be happy.

905
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:56,470
- Then we forget about Chicago.
- I can't forget anything about Eva.

906
00:56:56,676 --> 00:56:59,669
- If she were mine, I'd beat her.
- She's not yours.

907
00:57:00,614 --> 00:57:01,445
Jud, darling!

908
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:06,284
You mustn't keep the lady waiting.

909
00:57:29,543 --> 00:57:31,171
- Good night.
- I'd like to come in for a drink.

910
00:57:31,378 --> 00:57:34,507
Thank you so much
for driving me all this way.

911
00:57:34,714 --> 00:57:36,273
I'm so grateful.

912
00:57:36,483 --> 00:57:39,248
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- No, good night.

913
00:57:47,194 --> 00:57:49,322
And it's got
the cutest kitchen, Jen...

914
00:57:49,529 --> 00:57:51,225
...with an open fireplace.

915
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:52,922
Right here. See?

916
00:57:53,133 --> 00:57:55,364
The floors are old and
have cracks so wide...

917
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:58,368
...that you can practically
see right through them.

918
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:03,138
It used to be the <i>garonnire,</i>
what they call the bachelor's house.

919
00:58:03,343 --> 00:58:06,279
Every plantation had one
for overnight gentlemen callers.

920
00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:10,940
Jud says that he feels wicked,
taking a girl to a bachelor's house.

921
00:58:11,151 --> 00:58:13,279
I told him that if he--

922
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:17,489
Go on.

923
00:58:17,691 --> 00:58:19,819
It's such a pretty thought.

924
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:23,353
I forgot what I was saying.

925
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:29,662
You do forget things,
don't you, Carol?

926
00:58:34,307 --> 00:58:36,674
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

927
00:58:37,177 --> 00:58:39,737
But I was upset about something.

928
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:41,812
I'm not upset anymore.

929
00:58:43,149 --> 00:58:44,981
Please forgive me?

930
00:58:49,456 --> 00:58:50,822
I'm interested in you.

931
00:58:51,024 --> 00:58:54,119
I am fond of you
and want you to be happy.

932
00:58:54,628 --> 00:58:57,325
And even though
it hurts me terribly...

933
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,522
...I think we should talk...

934
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,834
...about you and Jud.

935
00:59:03,937 --> 00:59:05,235
What about us?

936
00:59:07,073 --> 00:59:09,167
Carol, you're so good.

937
00:59:09,376 --> 00:59:13,074
It's hard for you to imagine
that others aren't...

938
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:17,909
...as nice as you are.

939
00:59:18,918 --> 00:59:20,910
I'd like to prepare you, that's all.

940
00:59:21,121 --> 00:59:23,113
For anything you might hear about Jud.

941
00:59:23,323 --> 00:59:24,586
Eva?

942
00:59:26,126 --> 00:59:27,253
Don't.

943
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:31,153
Why, Jennifer!
I think you've found out.

944
00:59:31,364 --> 00:59:34,266
How clever of you!
And so quickly too.

945
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:38,234
You'll have to tell me how you knew.
Some other time, of course.

946
00:59:38,672 --> 00:59:39,731
What are you talking about?

947
00:59:40,073 --> 00:59:43,202
I'm talking about men.
I know men, and I know Jud.

948
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,072
You know your men.

949
00:59:45,278 --> 00:59:47,543
Any man's my man,
if I want it that way.

950
00:59:47,747 --> 00:59:48,874
Not Jud.

951
00:59:49,683 --> 00:59:53,245
Jud's like other men,
no better, no worse.

952
00:59:53,887 --> 00:59:56,379
Are you telling me
Jud's carrying on some affair...

953
00:59:56,589 --> 00:59:59,252
...I don't know about?
Is that it?

954
01:00:05,465 --> 01:00:06,728
Ask him.

955
01:00:09,235 --> 01:00:12,467
Do you think I'll run to him
with something as stupid as this?

956
01:00:13,306 --> 01:00:16,538
Do you think I'll let you spoil things
for us at the last minute?

957
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:18,803
- Ask him.
- No, I won't ask him.

958
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:21,504
I won't go to him with your lies.

959
01:00:22,215 --> 01:00:26,277
I wouldn't lie to you about
something as important as this.

960
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:32,782
Well, then...

961
01:00:33,693 --> 01:00:36,356
...if it's true,
tell me who it is.

962
01:00:38,164 --> 01:00:39,359
Who do you think?

963
01:00:47,307 --> 01:00:48,502
Ask him.

964
01:00:53,346 --> 01:00:55,338
Phillips people are not afraid.

965
01:00:55,749 --> 01:00:58,446
Isn't that what
your grandfather used to say?

966
01:00:59,185 --> 01:01:01,154
I've heard the children say it.

967
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:03,989
Phillips people are not afraid.

968
01:01:06,226 --> 01:01:07,785
You're afraid.

969
01:01:18,605 --> 01:01:20,938
Don't let her do this to you.

970
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:23,369
I'm not afraid.

971
01:01:34,754 --> 01:01:36,450
You've done a terrible thing.

972
01:01:36,656 --> 01:01:39,785
If you're not happy here, darling,
you really should leave.

973
01:01:39,993 --> 01:01:42,121
I'll help you pack tomorrow,
if I have time.

974
01:01:42,328 --> 01:01:43,990
I'm not leaving.

975
01:01:44,197 --> 01:01:45,358
Not now.

976
01:01:45,565 --> 01:01:47,830
Then you'd better be polite to me.

977
01:01:48,034 --> 01:01:51,232
And, darling, turn out the lights
when you come upstairs.

978
01:02:01,147 --> 01:02:04,447
Where's Carol? I've been phoning
ever since she left my place.

979
01:02:04,751 --> 01:02:07,084
I waited up for her,
and she didn't come home.

980
01:02:07,287 --> 01:02:09,347
She isn't in her room. I looked.

981
01:02:10,523 --> 01:02:12,719
She may be at the stables.

982
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,262
She usually goes riding
when she's upset about something.

983
01:02:19,365 --> 01:02:20,856
She's upset.

984
01:02:22,335 --> 01:02:24,668
We could see if her horse is gone.

985
01:02:31,744 --> 01:02:33,542
She made me spell it out for her.

986
01:02:33,746 --> 01:02:37,911
I told her it meant nothing, but she
just looked at me that way she has.

987
01:02:38,117 --> 01:02:39,983
Maybe I should have lied to her.

988
01:02:40,186 --> 01:02:43,486
But I thought it would be better
if I told her the truth.

989
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,819
She never said a word,
not a solitary, mumbling--

990
01:03:15,188 --> 01:03:16,850
You didn't bring me breakfast.

991
01:03:17,056 --> 01:03:18,422
- It's Carol.
- I forgive you.

992
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:20,787
- Listen.
- It's a beautiful day!

993
01:03:20,994 --> 01:03:21,962
It's about Carol.

994
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:25,565
She's dead, Eva.
She's killed herself.

995
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:00,199
Hey, now, I'd better button you up.

996
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,095
Come on.

997
01:04:01,301 --> 01:04:05,238
It's fun being with you.
Not like that Miss Breen.

998
01:04:05,672 --> 01:04:07,868
She's too busy to enjoy herself.

999
01:04:08,074 --> 01:04:11,875
Your mommy's been ill for two weeks.
Miss Breen's taking care of her.

1000
01:04:12,078 --> 01:04:14,206
She said I was a brat.

1001
01:04:14,414 --> 01:04:16,974
And she said Aunt Carol Lee was dead.

1002
01:04:17,183 --> 01:04:19,175
Is she dead, Jen?

1003
01:04:19,385 --> 01:04:21,217
She shouldn't have told you that.

1004
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:24,391
She was talking to Miss George.
We heard her.

1005
01:04:24,591 --> 01:04:26,958
She said Aunt Carol was nutty
as a fruitcake.

1006
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,492
What does that mean?

1007
01:04:28,695 --> 01:04:30,823
"Nutty as a fruitcake"?

1008
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:37,696
I'd better have a talk
with Miss Breen.

1009
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:40,806
Do what I do.
Last night, I spit on her.

1010
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:43,069
That wasn't nice.

1011
01:04:44,477 --> 01:04:47,140
It wasn't very much spit.

1012
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:52,741
Come on, you two.

1013
01:04:55,855 --> 01:04:58,290
- Last one in is a rotten egg!
- I won't be!

1014
01:04:58,491 --> 01:04:59,754
Looks like I am, doesn't it?

1015
01:04:59,959 --> 01:05:03,760
Jennifer's a rotten egg!
Jennifer's a rotten egg!

1016
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:06,523
Children, let's remember
our manners.

1017
01:05:06,733 --> 01:05:09,669
Upstairs to your room
with Miss George.

1018
01:05:11,571 --> 01:05:13,665
And get all your things picked up.

1019
01:05:13,873 --> 01:05:16,001
Or Breensy will slap lazy hands.

1020
01:05:16,209 --> 01:05:18,872
Miss Breen, just to clarify
things for you...

1021
01:05:19,078 --> 01:05:21,070
...I'm taking care of the children.

1022
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,579
Mrs. Phillips hired me.

1023
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:26,618
I understand she's
feeling much better.

1024
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:28,811
You must be taking good care of her.

1025
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:32,254
It's no trouble at all with her.
She's such a sweet lady.

1026
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:34,450
Some of my patients....

1027
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:38,029
You wouldn't believe
what I go through in some cases.

1028
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:40,530
You look like you can handle
almost anything.

1029
01:05:40,733 --> 01:05:42,702
I don't know about that.

1030
01:05:42,902 --> 01:05:45,997
But I do know that you have
to keep people in line.

1031
01:05:46,205 --> 01:05:48,765
All kinds of people.

1032
01:05:51,878 --> 01:05:53,642
And how are you?

1033
01:05:53,946 --> 01:05:55,346
I'm fine.

1034
01:05:58,551 --> 01:06:01,146
We don't get along very well, do we?

1035
01:06:02,355 --> 01:06:05,416
I'm not very good at hiding
my feelings, I'm afraid.

1036
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,423
I don't like you.

1037
01:06:07,894 --> 01:06:10,489
That's all right. Neither do I.

1038
01:06:11,564 --> 01:06:14,090
These look all right.
We'll do the inventory tomorrow.

1039
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,996
First thing in the morning.

1040
01:06:16,202 --> 01:06:18,865
I have to be in New Orleans
to settle the contracts...

1041
01:06:19,072 --> 01:06:20,301
...before I leave the company.

1042
01:06:20,506 --> 01:06:23,874
I wish you'd change your mind.
You'll be a hard man to replace.

1043
01:06:24,077 --> 01:06:25,807
You'll find someone.

1044
01:06:26,012 --> 01:06:27,036
Make an effort.

1045
01:06:27,246 --> 01:06:29,738
You ought to take time,
think things out.

1046
01:06:30,817 --> 01:06:32,843
I don't like to think.

1047
01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:41,020
Jud leaving the mill?

1048
01:06:41,227 --> 01:06:42,217
In a few weeks.

1049
01:06:42,428 --> 01:06:44,192
He's very tired.

1050
01:06:45,865 --> 01:06:48,528
You look tired yourself,
like the rest of us.

1051
01:06:49,168 --> 01:06:52,161
You were so young and happy
when you came here.

1052
01:06:53,539 --> 01:06:56,008
That was when I had pride.

1053
01:06:58,745 --> 01:07:00,373
Why do you say that?

1054
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,612
You know why.

1055
01:07:02,815 --> 01:07:05,148
Apparently, everybody does.

1056
01:07:06,018 --> 01:07:08,453
I guess it's the way I look at you.

1057
01:07:10,456 --> 01:07:12,322
There's no future in me.

1058
01:07:13,526 --> 01:07:15,757
Fall in love with Ty McKinnon.

1059
01:07:16,395 --> 01:07:18,227
I don't want him.

1060
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,598
Perhaps someday you will.
I like to think you will.

1061
01:07:24,403 --> 01:07:28,397
It pleasures me to think of you
and Ty laughing and having fun.

1062
01:07:30,243 --> 01:07:32,838
At least there'll be one mistake
I didn't make.

1063
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:37,383
Really?

1064
01:07:38,618 --> 01:07:42,248
It's simply amazing what
you stumble over in dark corners.

1065
01:07:42,955 --> 01:07:45,254
But then, nothing surprises me
in this house.

1066
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:47,120
It's that kind of house.

1067
01:07:47,326 --> 01:07:51,889
If you'd think more about my children
and less about my husband....

1068
01:07:52,098 --> 01:07:55,193
After all, he is old enough
to be your father.

1069
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:00,763
I gather you've been amusing
yourself while I was ill.

1070
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:02,635
There's no reason to worry.

1071
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:06,444
I'm not worried.
Really, I'm not.

1072
01:08:06,913 --> 01:08:09,849
Why don't you come in
and see if you can amuse me?

1073
01:08:14,654 --> 01:08:16,850
That's enough of that, young man!

1074
01:08:17,857 --> 01:08:20,452
You're just a great big baby.

1075
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,801
- Please hurry.
- Is something wrong?

1076
01:08:30,002 --> 01:08:32,267
The children. It's that woman.

1077
01:08:32,905 --> 01:08:35,534
Hold still!
Do you want me to slap you again?

1078
01:08:38,211 --> 01:08:39,679
Why, Mr. Phillips!

1079
01:08:42,014 --> 01:08:43,448
Teddy, you go to my room.

1080
01:08:43,649 --> 01:08:45,709
Trissa, you sleep with Cousin Jen.

1081
01:08:46,085 --> 01:08:48,145
I was only doing what I think best.

1082
01:08:48,354 --> 01:08:50,619
You have to handle
these things very firmly.

1083
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:54,125
If you're not out tomorrow,
I'll throw you out.

1084
01:08:54,327 --> 01:08:55,761
Do you understand?

1085
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:02,493
Yes, I do understand.

1086
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:05,363
I understand everything perfectly.

1087
01:09:05,571 --> 01:09:08,803
Of course, you know
I shall have to report this...

1088
01:09:09,008 --> 01:09:11,603
...episode to your wife.

1089
01:09:13,012 --> 01:09:15,311
Make sure you leave right afterward.

1090
01:09:21,187 --> 01:09:24,783
These look all right.
We'd better start stockpiling cotton.

1091
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:27,153
I've set the bins aside for it.

1092
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,919
Anything else, sir?

1093
01:09:30,763 --> 01:09:32,391
There is something.

1094
01:09:32,999 --> 01:09:34,865
We used to be friends.

1095
01:09:35,635 --> 01:09:36,898
Did we...

1096
01:09:37,303 --> 01:09:38,498
...friend?

1097
01:09:38,905 --> 01:09:41,670
Since Carol's death,
you've been acting like this.

1098
01:09:41,874 --> 01:09:44,309
Will you live with it
the rest of your life?

1099
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,479
No, you are.

1100
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,240
Are you blaming me?

1101
01:09:57,857 --> 01:09:59,155
We're nearly through.

1102
01:09:59,358 --> 01:10:01,725
I don't mind Jud hearing
what I have to say.

1103
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:04,020
We haven't seen you for some time.

1104
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,392
I don't think I've seen you since--

1105
01:10:07,066 --> 01:10:08,762
Since the funeral.

1106
01:10:09,035 --> 01:10:12,335
- If you want to talk--
- It's about Miss Breen.

1107
01:10:13,372 --> 01:10:14,567
I fired her.

1108
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:16,373
No, darling.

1109
01:10:16,876 --> 01:10:19,004
Don't go.
We have no secrets from you.

1110
01:10:19,211 --> 01:10:21,874
I might need protection from my husband.

1111
01:10:22,081 --> 01:10:24,710
If he still feels brutal this morning.

1112
01:10:25,384 --> 01:10:27,376
Miss Breen said you were brutal.

1113
01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:29,282
She leaves today.

1114
01:10:31,657 --> 01:10:33,751
You'll change your mind.

1115
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:36,185
If only to please me.

1116
01:10:37,163 --> 01:10:38,358
I am your wife.

1117
01:10:38,564 --> 01:10:39,588
That can be corrected.

1118
01:10:42,134 --> 01:10:44,535
Perhaps you were thinking
of divorce again.

1119
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:48,135
I haven't said so.

1120
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:49,736
I hope not.

1121
01:10:49,942 --> 01:10:52,673
Because that would be
very difficult for you...

1122
01:10:52,878 --> 01:10:53,607
...and Jen.

1123
01:10:56,315 --> 01:10:58,147
She has nothing to do with it.

1124
01:10:58,351 --> 01:10:59,649
Yes, she does.

1125
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:02,749
- Imagine what the newspapers would say.
- About what?

1126
01:11:02,955 --> 01:11:05,686
My testimony, sweet, in court.

1127
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,825
How you and my dear cousin
have been acting.

1128
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:13,465
Right under my very nose too.

1129
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:16,295
Scampering along the corridors at night.

1130
01:11:16,502 --> 01:11:18,596
From one room to another.

1131
01:11:20,106 --> 01:11:24,544
I imagine Miss Breen would even
exaggerate a little.

1132
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,944
Don't leave. This is just
a friendly discussion.

1133
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:33,085
I have a weak stomach.

1134
01:11:40,593 --> 01:11:42,494
If you're looking for Eva,
she's with him...

1135
01:11:42,695 --> 01:11:45,324
...ripping him to shreds
and smiling all the while.

1136
01:11:45,531 --> 01:11:46,931
A lovely smile.

1137
01:11:47,133 --> 01:11:49,364
The same way she was
with Carol that night.

1138
01:11:49,568 --> 01:11:50,467
What night?

1139
01:11:52,004 --> 01:11:54,701
When she told Carol about you and her.

1140
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:03,508
Eva!

1141
01:12:05,518 --> 01:12:06,781
Of course.

1142
01:12:08,254 --> 01:12:11,122
I thought it was him.
I thought he'd changed his mind.

1143
01:12:14,393 --> 01:12:16,885
It was Eva who told Carol.

1144
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:19,657
Didn't you know?

1145
01:12:20,366 --> 01:12:22,232
No, I didn't know.

1146
01:12:23,369 --> 01:12:24,837
Now I do.

1147
01:12:26,439 --> 01:12:28,340
It makes sense now.

1148
01:12:34,513 --> 01:12:35,845
We're through, Eva.

1149
01:12:36,048 --> 01:12:37,380
All through.

1150
01:12:39,518 --> 01:12:43,319
I've had enough of you, if I have
to break your neck with my hands.

1151
01:12:43,522 --> 01:12:45,957
That would hardly solve matters,
would it?

1152
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:47,922
For you, or Jen either.

1153
01:12:49,128 --> 01:12:52,929
Don't be stupid enough to think
I won't fight you if you try anything.

1154
01:12:53,132 --> 01:12:55,533
I'll use any weapon I can find.

1155
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:57,726
And there are weapons.

1156
01:12:57,937 --> 01:12:59,667
You're a known alcoholic...

1157
01:12:59,872 --> 01:13:02,774
...Miss Breen has her
filthy imagination.

1158
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,207
And your own sister, Carol,
when she found out about you....

1159
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:09,680
You can imagine how it would sound.

1160
01:13:12,618 --> 01:13:14,678
You wouldn't enjoy it.

1161
01:13:15,087 --> 01:13:17,283
Whatever I am, and I know what I am...

1162
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:19,618
...you can't get away from me.

1163
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:26,597
One more thing.

1164
01:13:26,966 --> 01:13:30,664
I'm afraid I'll have to insist
that you stay away from Jennifer.

1165
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:35,774
I can't have you carrying on openly
in front of Miss Breen and the children.

1166
01:13:35,975 --> 01:13:37,637
It's very naughty.

1167
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,774
This is our home.

1168
01:14:09,408 --> 01:14:10,706
I want to play football.

1169
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:12,310
You promised.

1170
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,273
In goes in the doctor.

1171
01:14:16,482 --> 01:14:17,677
In goes the nurse.

1172
01:14:17,883 --> 01:14:21,149
In goes the lady
with the alligator purse.

1173
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:24,918
For Jennifer.

1174
01:14:25,124 --> 01:14:26,092
Come on.

1175
01:14:26,292 --> 01:14:28,454
Please. All right?

1176
01:14:58,757 --> 01:15:01,090
I'm so bored I could scream.

1177
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:04,388
Imagine the two of us
having dinner alone together.

1178
01:15:05,164 --> 01:15:08,464
Alone in a world of men.
It's incredible.

1179
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:15,207
You sit there. You can see
yourself in the mirror.

1180
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:30,421
I must say you're not the most
sparkling company I've ever enjoyed.

1181
01:15:30,623 --> 01:15:33,024
Why bother to set a place
for Mr. Phillips?

1182
01:15:33,225 --> 01:15:34,989
He never comes down to dinner.

1183
01:15:35,194 --> 01:15:37,356
One would think he didn't
find us attractive.

1184
01:15:37,563 --> 01:15:39,031
On the contrary.

1185
01:15:40,699 --> 01:15:42,964
The charming Mrs. Phillips, I believe.

1186
01:15:46,505 --> 01:15:47,768
What brings this on?

1187
01:15:47,973 --> 01:15:51,034
I decided there's very little
comfort sulking in my room.

1188
01:15:52,578 --> 01:15:55,980
Especially when there are
more attractive alternatives.

1189
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:57,581
Alternatives?

1190
01:15:58,117 --> 01:15:59,107
You.

1191
01:15:59,985 --> 01:16:02,113
And Jen, of course.

1192
01:16:03,656 --> 01:16:05,352
But mostly...

1193
01:16:05,557 --> 01:16:06,547
...you.

1194
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:15,433
Aren't you overdoing it a trifle?

1195
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:20,195
After all, you haven't been exactly
a devoted husband lately.

1196
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:21,905
My error.

1197
01:16:24,043 --> 01:16:27,502
You can't do it one way, do it another.
That's my motto.

1198
01:16:28,914 --> 01:16:30,382
Here's to other ways.

1199
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,246
And to the past.
May it rest in peace.

1200
01:16:37,423 --> 01:16:39,688
This is all so unexpected.

1201
01:16:40,225 --> 01:16:42,194
I'm simply overwhelmed.

1202
01:16:43,629 --> 01:16:46,656
And, I might add, not at all convinced.

1203
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,968
I suddenly realized what
a fool I've been all these years.

1204
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:52,433
That's true.

1205
01:16:55,207 --> 01:16:57,335
I was wrong.
Refusing to go out with you...

1206
01:16:57,543 --> 01:16:59,944
...refusing to like your friends.

1207
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:03,079
Refusing to be my husband, in fact.

1208
01:17:06,952 --> 01:17:08,511
That's the past.

1209
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:11,347
The future will be different.

1210
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:17,260
I'll go anywhere you want to go.

1211
01:17:17,463 --> 01:17:19,193
I want to be with you.

1212
01:17:20,466 --> 01:17:22,560
I believe you actually mean it.

1213
01:17:23,502 --> 01:17:25,733
Suddenly, you're very important to me.

1214
01:17:27,339 --> 01:17:30,400
I want everyone to know
how devoted we are.

1215
01:17:33,178 --> 01:17:35,875
How completely in love.

1216
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:41,378
If you really feel this way...

1217
01:17:41,987 --> 01:17:43,785
...I couldn't be happier.

1218
01:17:45,057 --> 01:17:47,117
To our second honeymoon?

1219
01:17:52,398 --> 01:17:54,765
You're not drinking
to our second honeymoon.

1220
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:56,993
She will, of course.
Won't you, Jen?

1221
01:18:00,072 --> 01:18:01,563
To our second honeymoon.

1222
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,071
To your second honeymoon.

1223
01:18:05,878 --> 01:18:07,744
May it last forever.

1224
01:18:09,715 --> 01:18:10,876
Forever.

1225
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:29,735
Miss George?

1226
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:32,932
Is that you, Miss George?

1227
01:18:40,879 --> 01:18:42,108
Oh, it's you.

1228
01:18:42,481 --> 01:18:43,676
I thought....

1229
01:18:46,351 --> 01:18:48,320
I don't know what I thought.

1230
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,084
You frightened me.

1231
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:52,656
I didn't think it was possible.

1232
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:54,690
You could do anything to me.

1233
01:18:54,893 --> 01:18:56,521
You always could.

1234
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,399
Don't you want me to kiss you?

1235
01:19:00,599 --> 01:19:03,159
I'm getting something out of my pocket.

1236
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:04,427
What is it?

1237
01:19:05,404 --> 01:19:07,464
Please tell me what it is.

1238
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:19,882
The stars!

1239
01:19:20,085 --> 01:19:22,953
Look at them.
They're so beautiful.

1240
01:19:27,092 --> 01:19:29,652
You got it for me,
as you said you would.

1241
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:32,892
You wanted it, didn't you?

1242
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:36,895
I was mad for it.

1243
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:46,308
It's so beautiful.

1244
01:19:47,346 --> 01:19:49,281
Put it on for me.

1245
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:58,690
Well, it's yours.

1246
01:19:59,992 --> 01:20:01,551
Now you can die happy.

1247
01:20:02,828 --> 01:20:05,195
What an odd thing to say.

1248
01:20:05,397 --> 01:20:07,559
Remember, you said
if you could only have it....

1249
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:09,462
I remember.

1250
01:20:10,035 --> 01:20:12,231
I said I'd die happy.

1251
01:20:13,038 --> 01:20:14,631
Now you can, darling.

1252
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,365
Now you can.

1253
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:26,346
You're doing the right thing.

1254
01:20:26,552 --> 01:20:28,919
Go back and make a place for yourself.

1255
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:32,319
No use in pining away
because of some fool man.

1256
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:40,290
I was in love once myself.

1257
01:20:41,266 --> 01:20:44,327
But it didn't work into anything.
He was just no good.

1258
01:20:45,437 --> 01:20:46,564
Still...

1259
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:49,237
...he did make me laugh.

1260
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:53,440
Now, now, honey.
What's the matter?

1261
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:55,637
Come on, come on.

1262
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:58,848
Jennifer isn't leaving
till the morning.

1263
01:20:59,051 --> 01:21:00,610
You'll see her again.

1264
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,378
It's past your bedtime.

1265
01:21:02,588 --> 01:21:03,886
Both of you.

1266
01:21:14,633 --> 01:21:16,898
You will come back, won't you?

1267
01:21:17,102 --> 01:21:19,367
You have to come back.

1268
01:21:20,973 --> 01:21:22,635
Someday I'll come back.

1269
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:24,469
You wait and see.

1270
01:21:25,877 --> 01:21:28,176
Now you'd better be getting to bed.

1271
01:21:30,649 --> 01:21:33,346
You know how you hate to see people cry.

1272
01:21:33,785 --> 01:21:35,845
I'm going to in a minute.

1273
01:21:39,891 --> 01:21:42,087
Remember when you came here?

1274
01:21:43,095 --> 01:21:44,996
I said I hated you.

1275
01:21:46,965 --> 01:21:48,365
I remember.

1276
01:21:48,567 --> 01:21:50,035
I never did.

1277
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:52,504
I was only fooling.

1278
01:21:53,205 --> 01:21:54,639
There, you see.

1279
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,536
Now I'm crying.

1280
01:21:57,175 --> 01:21:58,700
So am I.

1281
01:22:20,999 --> 01:22:23,161
Mr. Phillips says
he'll be down in a minute.

1282
01:22:23,368 --> 01:22:24,358
Thank you.

1283
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:28,802
Miss Jennifer's in the library.

1284
01:22:37,516 --> 01:22:39,178
My train leaves at 11.

1285
01:22:39,384 --> 01:22:40,852
<i>I'll pick you up at 10.</i>

1286
01:22:41,053 --> 01:22:43,613
I thought you were still in New Orleans.

1287
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:46,920
I got back today.

1288
01:22:47,926 --> 01:22:50,293
You're in time to help me with this.

1289
01:22:54,066 --> 01:22:55,864
There's the catch, right there.

1290
01:22:57,335 --> 01:22:58,860
Put it on the couch, please.

1291
01:22:59,137 --> 01:23:00,264
Isn't it lovely?

1292
01:23:00,472 --> 01:23:01,735
Looks real.

1293
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,806
Everything I have is real.

1294
01:23:04,009 --> 01:23:06,240
I'd be the last to deny it.

1295
01:23:06,445 --> 01:23:09,176
Thoughtful gift from one of your many...

1296
01:23:09,381 --> 01:23:10,781
...admirers?

1297
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:14,151
From the most exciting man
I've ever known.

1298
01:23:14,352 --> 01:23:15,843
You'd never guess.

1299
01:23:16,388 --> 01:23:17,822
Avery Phillips.

1300
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:19,658
I'm impressed.

1301
01:23:19,858 --> 01:23:23,056
I hear everything's sweetness
and light since I've been gone.

1302
01:23:23,695 --> 01:23:25,721
We're on our second honeymoon.

1303
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:27,627
It's wonderful.

1304
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:29,865
I've never been happier.

1305
01:23:30,068 --> 01:23:31,058
And he....

1306
01:23:31,603 --> 01:23:33,367
He's a different man.

1307
01:23:33,872 --> 01:23:35,204
Different man.

1308
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:37,069
That's what I hear.

1309
01:23:39,244 --> 01:23:41,839
Now I'm ready for any kind of frolic.

1310
01:23:42,047 --> 01:23:43,037
Really?

1311
01:23:44,382 --> 01:23:45,748
With my husband.

1312
01:23:45,951 --> 01:23:47,579
I'll be expecting you.

1313
01:23:47,786 --> 01:23:48,776
Goodbye.

1314
01:23:50,355 --> 01:23:51,584
Who was that?

1315
01:23:52,057 --> 01:23:53,525
Ty McKinnon.

1316
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:55,953
He'll take me to the train tomorrow.

1317
01:23:57,395 --> 01:24:00,263
That's right, you are leaving tomorrow.

1318
01:24:00,465 --> 01:24:01,990
I almost forgot.

1319
01:24:02,701 --> 01:24:05,364
What do you think about that?
Jennifer's leaving us.

1320
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:07,937
She probably has her reasons.

1321
01:24:10,408 --> 01:24:12,343
I can't think of any.

1322
01:24:12,844 --> 01:24:15,370
But we mustn't stand
in her way, must we?

1323
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,310
A noble attitude.

1324
01:24:17,516 --> 01:24:21,647
What upsets me is our not being at home
on your last evening here.

1325
01:24:21,853 --> 01:24:24,550
But Avery insisted on going out.

1326
01:24:24,756 --> 01:24:26,782
We're going to a party.

1327
01:24:26,992 --> 01:24:29,962
In fact, we're late now.
I wonder what's keeping him.

1328
01:24:30,162 --> 01:24:33,360
Why don't I tell him you're ready?
Is that what you had in mind?

1329
01:24:33,565 --> 01:24:35,830
You're a love, an absolute love.

1330
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:36,865
Not at all.

1331
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:40,766
I'm just curious to see
the different man.

1332
01:24:56,988 --> 01:24:59,116
Don't be bitter, Jennifer.

1333
01:24:59,324 --> 01:25:02,385
And you mustn't hate me.
It isn't good for you.

1334
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:04,995
You're young. There are things
you don't understand.

1335
01:25:05,197 --> 01:25:07,393
I am not that young.

1336
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,496
I'm not a very nice person.

1337
01:25:10,936 --> 01:25:12,768
But I wasn't always like that.

1338
01:25:14,039 --> 01:25:16,304
Once, I was a great deal like you:

1339
01:25:16,675 --> 01:25:20,237
Young and innocent.
Always trying to do the right thing.

1340
01:25:20,445 --> 01:25:22,778
That must have been long ago.

1341
01:25:26,852 --> 01:25:28,286
That hurt.

1342
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:31,085
Sounds like something I might say.

1343
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:35,226
You see, there's a little of me
in every woman.

1344
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:36,861
I guess there has to be.

1345
01:25:37,062 --> 01:25:39,463
I don't understand you.
I don't want to.

1346
01:25:39,731 --> 01:25:41,199
You think I've been cruel.

1347
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:42,765
And I have.

1348
01:25:44,936 --> 01:25:48,600
It didn't start with you.
It really had nothing to do with you...

1349
01:25:48,807 --> 01:25:52,403
...until you started peeking into
closets where you didn't belong.

1350
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:55,604
You asked me to come here
and then begged me to stay.

1351
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,783
Did you ever ask yourself why?

1352
01:26:03,054 --> 01:26:05,023
I tried to tell you once.

1353
01:26:11,863 --> 01:26:13,798
Because I was lonely.

1354
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:33,385
Saying goodbye?

1355
01:26:34,085 --> 01:26:36,987
- I thought you were in New Orleans.
- I got back today.

1356
01:26:37,289 --> 01:26:39,121
Just in time, apparently.

1357
01:27:17,829 --> 01:27:19,297
What are you doing?

1358
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:22,296
Looking for the farewell letter.

1359
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,264
There's always a farewell letter.

1360
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:28,740
Or were you smart enough to leave it
in your safe-deposit box?

1361
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:32,399
I suppose, eventually, you'll tell me
what you're talking about.

1362
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:33,600
Sure.

1363
01:27:33,878 --> 01:27:35,938
You're going to kill Eva.

1364
01:27:36,147 --> 01:27:37,672
I'm wondering how and when.

1365
01:27:37,882 --> 01:27:39,248
Watching you with the boy...

1366
01:27:39,451 --> 01:27:41,977
...I'd say it's due for tonight.
That leaves how.

1367
01:27:42,787 --> 01:27:43,914
Guess some more.

1368
01:27:51,096 --> 01:27:52,496
Automobile.

1369
01:27:55,066 --> 01:27:57,297
It's happened before with you and Eva.

1370
01:27:57,836 --> 01:28:00,965
Another accident, only this time
you don't walk away.

1371
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,475
"Too bad," the neighbors will say.

1372
01:28:05,477 --> 01:28:07,412
"They were so happy."

1373
01:28:09,848 --> 01:28:11,111
Good guess?

1374
01:28:13,785 --> 01:28:16,846
Don't say it out loud again.
You'll spoil the effect.

1375
01:28:17,922 --> 01:28:19,823
My hands would be shaking.

1376
01:28:22,127 --> 01:28:23,720
You can't do it.

1377
01:28:24,996 --> 01:28:27,488
Stay by the phone.
You'll get the news quicker.

1378
01:28:27,932 --> 01:28:29,958
Do you think it solves anything?

1379
01:28:30,168 --> 01:28:34,128
Will it make your children happy?
Jennifer or anybody at all?

1380
01:28:34,339 --> 01:28:35,329
Me.

1381
01:28:35,974 --> 01:28:37,966
You don't deserve to be happy.

1382
01:28:38,176 --> 01:28:40,509
You're to blame for all of this.
All of it!

1383
01:28:40,712 --> 01:28:43,841
You created your own private hell,
then went into your room...

1384
01:28:44,049 --> 01:28:46,678
...and drank yourself into
not caring about anything.

1385
01:28:46,885 --> 01:28:49,582
- What does that make you?
- I know what it makes me.

1386
01:28:50,355 --> 01:28:52,654
Why do you think simply breathing
is more than I can bear?

1387
01:28:52,857 --> 01:28:54,189
Leave me alone, Jud.

1388
01:28:54,392 --> 01:28:56,657
I know what I'm doing,
and Eva goes with me.

1389
01:28:56,861 --> 01:28:58,523
That's the end of it.

1390
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,994
I'll tell her you're nearly ready.

1391
01:29:36,801 --> 01:29:38,394
I spoke to Avery.

1392
01:29:38,603 --> 01:29:41,232
He asked me to drive you to the party.
He'll be delayed.

1393
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:44,341
- Business call from New York.
- I don't mind waiting.

1394
01:29:44,542 --> 01:29:47,171
He knows that, but he
insisted that I take you.

1395
01:29:47,378 --> 01:29:48,573
All right.

1396
01:30:12,971 --> 01:30:13,995
Good evening.

1397
01:30:14,205 --> 01:30:15,400
Eva was disappointed--

1398
01:30:15,607 --> 01:30:17,906
This is one party
I don't want her to miss.

1399
01:30:18,109 --> 01:30:19,805
I'll get the car.
Tell her I'm ready.

1400
01:30:20,178 --> 01:30:21,942
But she just left.

1401
01:30:23,081 --> 01:30:24,947
Why should she leave without me?

1402
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:27,813
Jud said you wanted her to go.

1403
01:30:28,019 --> 01:30:31,547
He said he spoke to you, and
you told them to go on without you.

1404
01:30:34,292 --> 01:30:35,783
Stay with the children.

1405
01:30:51,376 --> 01:30:53,777
It's raining.
It's pouring.

1406
01:30:54,212 --> 01:30:57,307
The old man is snoring.
Isn't that how it goes?

1407
01:30:57,515 --> 01:30:59,984
I haven't thought about that in years.

1408
01:31:00,185 --> 01:31:01,517
I like the rain.

1409
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:03,381
I like it myself.

1410
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:05,648
You have to be careful
driving in the rain.

1411
01:31:05,857 --> 01:31:08,759
Funny how a car skids on a wet road.

1412
01:31:08,993 --> 01:31:11,428
A lot of people get killed
on a night like this.

1413
01:31:11,629 --> 01:31:13,097
I'm not worried.

1414
01:31:13,298 --> 01:31:14,960
You're a good driver.

1415
01:31:22,807 --> 01:31:25,299
You know what I've been doing all day?

1416
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:26,876
Checking up on you two.

1417
01:31:27,078 --> 01:31:28,410
You and Avery.

1418
01:31:29,447 --> 01:31:30,881
What about us?

1419
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:33,078
Everyone's talking about you...

1420
01:31:33,484 --> 01:31:35,077
...how happy you are.

1421
01:31:36,621 --> 01:31:37,452
Why not?

1422
01:31:37,822 --> 01:31:40,417
That's what Avery wants
people to think.

1423
01:31:44,195 --> 01:31:45,720
You're going too fast.

1424
01:31:46,297 --> 01:31:49,290
Not as fast as he would.
He wouldn't care about explaining.

1425
01:31:49,901 --> 01:31:50,891
Explaining what?

1426
01:31:51,102 --> 01:31:54,266
Why he's convincing people
you're the ideal couple...

1427
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:56,634
...just before it was set to happen.

1428
01:31:56,841 --> 01:32:01,074
It would've happened tonight, all right.
This rain's too good to miss.

1429
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,014
Take me back to the house.

1430
01:32:04,215 --> 01:32:05,843
Beginning to get the idea?

1431
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:06,881
You're right.

1432
01:32:07,085 --> 01:32:09,987
He was going to kill you.
And himself too.

1433
01:32:10,255 --> 01:32:11,245
Go back!

1434
01:32:11,456 --> 01:32:13,982
Glad I came back from New Orleans?
I am.

1435
01:32:14,192 --> 01:32:17,321
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to Avery. Not to him.

1436
01:32:17,528 --> 01:32:19,156
But he loves me.
I know he does.

1437
01:32:19,364 --> 01:32:21,560
You're the one.
You want to kill me.

1438
01:32:21,766 --> 01:32:22,859
Don't do it.

1439
01:32:23,067 --> 01:32:24,194
Let me off.

1440
01:32:25,903 --> 01:32:27,565
Let go of me!

1441
01:32:28,206 --> 01:32:29,868
Will you stop it!

1442
01:32:30,074 --> 01:32:30,905
Please, let me--

1443
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:33,868
Take me back!

1444
01:32:46,457 --> 01:32:49,518
It happened! It happened!
I know how it ends.

1445
01:32:49,727 --> 01:32:51,593
I know how it ends.

1446
01:32:52,463 --> 01:32:53,829
Go to sleep.

1447
01:32:54,599 --> 01:32:56,431
I know how it ends.

1448
01:33:28,399 --> 01:33:29,833
Yes, I'll be there.

1449
01:33:31,169 --> 01:33:32,159
All right.

1450
01:33:37,709 --> 01:33:39,268
They want me down there.

1451
01:33:40,044 --> 01:33:41,535
Questions.

1452
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:48,747
I'll go with you.

1453
01:34:14,078 --> 01:34:15,102
The sun's shining.

1454
01:34:15,313 --> 01:34:18,147
Funny, I didn't expect
the sun to be shining.
