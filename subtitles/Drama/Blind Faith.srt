1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,290
<i>That day you would have gone for a long journey.</i>

2
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,340
<i>That night, someone would come to you.</i>

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,970
<i>That person will make a plea from you.</i>

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,860
<i>Do not decline that person's plea.</i>

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,020
<i>I beg you.</i>

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,920
<i>On that day, you must return.</i>

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,010
<i>You must, in order for that person to live.</i>

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,110
<i>And also, on the morning of that day,</i>

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,260
<i>that child will break a medicine bowl.</i>

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,920
<i>And also, what else happened that day?</i>

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,830
<i>Right.  By the windowsill, in their full bloom,</i>

12
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,970
<i>I remember those chrysanthemums.</i>

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,980
<i>On that day, you must not send that person.</i>

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,220
<i>What awaited that person on that day was a trap.</i>

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,330
<i>Hence, Eun Soo, please hold onto that person.</i>

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,860
<i>Episode 17.</i>

17
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,950
Go and relate this.

18
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,190
Go and relate to that Prince Deokheung His Highness of yours.

19
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,330
That the High Doctor from Heaven wants to see him.

20
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,350
Right this very minute!

21
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,420
Why, what's so urgent?

22
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,770
Are you intending to kill that man Choi Young today?

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,980
Is it true?  Were you really?

24
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,340
How did you know?

25
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,920
It was real.

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,250
I told you!  Don't touch that person!

27
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,850
You agreed!

28
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,380
As I know it, I did.

29
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,370
The offender chased by the entire world came into the palace and tried to poison me, the king's proxy.

30
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,120
A person of such, you said to send him out of the palace without so much as a hair harmed.

31
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,940
Hence, did I not do that for you?

32
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,440
Today's trap.  What is it?  Where is it?

33
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,990
You know it's a trap?

34
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,160
I said, where is it?
Where do you intend to kill that person?

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,840
How did you know?
That he would be driven into a trap today.

36
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,160
The one who is fretting isn't me though.

37
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,240
Since that trap will soon be invoked.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,960
My notebook.  It was written in the last part.

39
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,280
Save that person.

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,260
What is that thing called notebook?

41
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,550
It couldn't be that today's trap is written in the few sheets left in that notebook.

42
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,220
To say such nonsensical thing...

43
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,620
I'll do everything.

44
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,530
I'll do everything you ask.  So please.

45
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,170
This house and today's movement.  Who else knows?

46
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,610
Other than us, no one should be aware.

47
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,100
That royal seal.  Is that really that important?

48
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,910
Look here.  This is for our citizenry to receive His Majesty the King's will.

49
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,680
To receive that will, isn't this something that can be produced again many times?

50
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,000
Whether those punks outside came with that royal seal as their aim,

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,740
or for some other reason, is what I must find out.

52
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,370
What outside punks?

53
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,230
Teacher, where did Scholar Moon go?

54
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,680
Who is that?

55
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,230
The owner of this house.  Lately we've been using this house to hold our secret meetings.

56
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,830
However, that person...

57
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,720
Stay there without a stir.

58
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,550
Choi Young is difficult to kill by sword, I heard.

59
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,030
Hence Prince of the Court taught me.

60
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,360
That person's weakness is justification.

61
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,590
Even if the petty folks betray him, as long as they bring him a justification, he can't shoot them out.

62
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:44,190
So with that justification, I set down the snare waiting for the trap prepared.

63
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,860
So you're saying you will kill him?

64
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,110
That person is no longer the captain of Woodalchi and he's someone trying to flee.

65
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,970
He's someone who would never force his way unless he's being attacked first.

66
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,330
Why must you kill him?

67
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,250
Because he's a hindrance.

68
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,900
In making you a person of mine.

69
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,040
What in the world are you saying?

70
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,080
I must have you,

71
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,800
in order for me to have Prince of the Court from Deokseong as well.

72
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,550
<i>Under where that person is at, cords of explosive powder have been laid.</i>

73
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,770
<i>One ember and even if he's a master of internal power, it will be unbearable.</i>

74
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,000
What do I need to do for you?

75
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,890
You and me... I am thinking we should start with a marriage first.

76
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,530
What?

77
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,820
A marriage to a royalty like me.

78
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,370
And soon, you could become Her Royal Highness the Queen as well.

79
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,120
This letter is a command to halt all operations.

80
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,460
We don't have a lot of time.

81
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,110
Is that it?

82
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,740
I just need to marry you?  Then let's do it.

83
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,130
What in the world are you doing right now?

84
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,600
Move aside.

85
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,880
The captain left safely, I'm told.

86
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,480
And people from Suribang joined him.

87
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,670
She's asking if there's more you'd like to know.

88
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,920
That's enough.  As long as that person is safe, it's enough.

89
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,740
What is this matter?

90
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,620
These are sent to High Doctor by Prince Deokheung.

91
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,880
There will be a small feast in the evening. He said he'd like you to attend.

92
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,810
What is that?

93
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,060
We'll come to escort you at the hour.

94
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,390
What exactly is happening?

95
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:20,270
I said I would marry that human being Prince Deokheung.

96
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,680
What?

97
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,590
Does any dog or cow come and go here?

98
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,740
It's His Majesty's order.

99
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,930
To keep the door open day and night.

100
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,310
Then, the spies and the assassins?

101
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,520
Watch well

102
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:50,510
and find them out by sense?

103
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,260
and find them out by sense?

104
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,430
His Majesty awaits.

105
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,010
I'll go first.

106
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,340
Look here.

107
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,400
Yes.

108
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,450
Thank you.

109
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,220
For guarding us safely.

110
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,050
I'll be going.

111
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,060
Your Majesty.

112
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,800
You have toiled much to come here.

113
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,960
Please sit.

114
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,160
How would we dare to, at the same table as the King?

115
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,550
See?  Didn't I say those who are much learned would be much startled?

116
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:56,530
This is a seat that old and young, women and men of this neighborhood,

117
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,610
This is a seat that old and young, women and men of this neighborhood,

118
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,350
even those of slave class have sat.
Hence, do not decline.

119
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,300
Or how about helping me a little while you're here?

120
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,370
By help?

121
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,820
I am in the process of sorting out the slave roster made in the past decade.

122
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,710
Slaves, you said?

123
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:41,680
First, those who were demoted from Yangmin to slave status, I will dispose of their slave papers.

124
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,100
You could start looking through those papers first.

125
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,000
We came to bring the Goryeo national seal.

126
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,100
I have heard.

127
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,550
I don't like this.  Something's strange.

128
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,920
They were intending to lock you guys up and blast the explosive powder?

129
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,260
Just at the boiling point.

130
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,960
But suddenly, they all disappeared.

131
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,280
Leaving the explosive powder as is.

132
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,220
What could this be?

133
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,540
Could it be Prince of the Court's doing?

134
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,310
Prince of the Court, just to kill a few old men,

135
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,890
he used such a complex measure?

136
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,590
Then it's Prince Deokheung.

137
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,530
Just to crush a royal seal?

138
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,470
Or he wanted to kill you, you brat.

139
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,220
Is that it?

140
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,990
Those old men were the bait and you were the quarry.

141
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,360
Why me?

142
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,300
That's what I'm saying.

143
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,700
And what's with the guard situation here?

144
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,880
I'm really not liking it.

145
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,230
His Majesty, in going out to the streets, has to check.

146
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,800
Go out where?

147
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,000
Together with Her Highness the Queen, there isn't anywhere they don't go.

148
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,670
Taking the Woodalchi kids and our maid warriors, giving us the taste of death.

149
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,550
Yesterday, they wanted to pick chestnuts and wandered around the back mountain, and ack!

150
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,310
Not liking it.

151
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,680
But anyways, where's High Doctor?

152
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,890
Why didn't she come with you?
I thought you were together.

153
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,220
What's with you?

154
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,920
Huh?

155
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,180
Well that... so...

156
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,770
what I'm supposed to do next.  I don't know it.

157
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,370
The Goryeo national seal produced upon gathering the will of the statesmen.

158
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:57,220
With relating this national seal as your pretext, you must have come to scope me out.

159
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,280
Indeed, is the King who's left the palace not in his right mind as the rumors have it?

160
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:10,810
Is he so feeble-minded that he himself delegated the King's power to rule to his uncle?

161
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,970
What else would there be?

162
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,270
Soon a petition is due to be sent to the Yuan emperor.

163
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,780
They probably need to judge which king to support.

164
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,770
Scared that they'd be caught on in their hovering in the middle, in trying to grasp the situation,

165
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,790
they even summoned the man they themselves cast away to guard them.

166
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:31,780
And that one that guarded has no pride.

167
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,890
And that one that guarded has no pride.

168
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,500
That's what I'm saying.

169
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,370
Goryeo monarch's new seal.  Good.

170
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,760
Do Chi.

171
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

172
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:05,100
I now have a new royal seal.  With that new seal, I will write my first royal order.

173
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:13,340
I will reinstate Choi Young and the reason is as follows:

174
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,230
Choi Young saved the queen's life during the revolt by Jo Il Shin...

175
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,180
and he contributed a great merit in safeguarding the King and the Royal escort.

176
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,530
For any faults prior, I give my pardon and I reinstate him.

177
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,600
<i>Seoyong [서용] = appoint one who's committed an offense to officiary post again.</i>

178
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,040
You are scoping things out well, right?

179
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,390
You come alone? What about your bodyguard?

180
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,040
I said I would come alone.

181
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,850
Have a seat.

182
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,480
Your Majesty can't be protected in this manner.

183
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,810
You let anyone in and out, and come and go.

184
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,560
And send your bodyguards away whenever you want.

185
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,150
Then, shall I slowly return to the palace?

186
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,350
Not before Prince Deokheung is sent out.

187
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,260
Two thousand palace soldiers are still in his grasp and moreover, he is one who uses poison.

188
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,190
Do you know how difficult it is to safeguard someone from someone who uses poison?

189
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,780
Is this amusing?

190
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,120
Whether as a Woodalchi or as an offender chased out,

191
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,280
whether as someone I trust or don't trust, how is that you are so without change?

192
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,150
I wonder too.

193
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,460
Is your dream to become a fisherman still?

194
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,850
That... I have forgotten that for quite some time.

195
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,710
Just earlier, with the royal seal you escorted here safely, I pardoned and reinstated you, Captain.

196
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,000
And I promoted you from 4B ranking to 4A.

197
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,500
And now your ranking is Hogun (General).

198
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,730
I don't think the statesmen would be pleased.

199
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,780
I may dismiss you from office again or even send you to exile at a given time.

200
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,780
Because... I am King.

201
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,380
Yes.

202
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,910
Still, I wish you would be with me.

203
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,570
I'm sorry, for giving you an officiary post again.

204
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,190
A letter from Royal Doctor Jang, did you say?

205
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,400
Hurry and read it.

206
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,370
What does it say?

207
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,960
Give it to me.

208
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,080
<i>High Doctor accepts Prince Deokheung's marriage proposal.</i>

209
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,330
What is this saying?  How could this...

210
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,190
Would it do to not tell him?

211
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,650
What?

212
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,830
To Captain.  Shouldn't we let him know?

213
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,080
What is it?

214
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,130
What is what?

215
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,460
What happened?

216
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,550
The matter that must be hidden from me.

217
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,330
High Doctor...

218
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,030
is getting married.

219
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,650
Marrying Prince Deokheung.

220
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:40,470
I don't know the details yet, but according to the letter from Royal Doctor Jang, High Doctor has agreed.

221
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,110
Don't be joking.

222
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,330
Royal Doctor Jang is worried as well.

223
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,080
Saying he's not sure what High Doctor's thinking.

224
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,960
That person is getting married, you said?

225
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,890
With that punk?

226
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,550
It seems to be the case.

227
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,980
Aunt.

228
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,020
Yup.

229
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:07,750
I just received an appointment to office so I need procedure to vacate my position.  Do that for me.

230
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,830
I'll go.

231
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,150
Those punks were aiming for your life.

232
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,130
So if you go, it could be dangerous...

233
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,210
I'm going.

234
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,600
Will you be alright alone?

235
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,820
I'll be back.

236
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,850
<i>Like rain</i>

237
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,520
<i>falling endlessly,</i>

238
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,110
<i>you are falling deep into my heart.</i>

239
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,800
<i>Like sand</i>

240
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,480
<i>that cannot be counted,</i>

241
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,270
<i>my heart is brimming with you.</i>

242
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,850
<i>Days that were lonely,</i>

243
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,350
<i>tears that twisted and turned,</i>

244
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:54,860
<i>I'm sending them away planted in a smile.</i>

245
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,490
<i>Because my steps linger,</i>

246
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,810
<i>because my heart lingers,</i>

247
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:10,020
<i>it has taken so long to return.</i>

248
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:17,710
<i>Because of it, it aches, and I yearn,</i>

249
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:24,880
<i>that which tears even in laughter is my love.</i>

250
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,740
<i>Even if time halts,</i>

251
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,690
<i>even if my heart halts,</i>

252
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:40,090
<i>like a lie it will live in my embrace again.</i>

253
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,940
<i>I love you.</i>

254
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,170
<i>My heart jumps</i>

255
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:54,180
<i>for you only.</i>

256
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:00,530
I've been waiting.

257
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,430
I've been waiting.

258
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,610
That royal throne.

259
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,880
This king's seat.  Would you like to sit in it?

260
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,780
Let's do this.

261
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,390
From now on, I will show proper decorum to you as the one from heaven who is to become the queen.

262
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:25,080
So you treat me as someone who is to become your husband and the king as well.

263
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,620
Here.

264
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,830
How do I look from there?

265
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,210
Imagine... I'm draped in Yongpo (king's garment)
and look clearly.

266
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,550
Here, tell me.

267
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,050
From what I see, you have a narcissistic personality disorder.

268
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,820
Greed for success.

269
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,740
Do whatever it takes for that success and lacking in empathy towards others.

270
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,280
Among patients who suffer from that, many think they themselves are geniuses.

271
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,450
Then let's do this.

272
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,210
Erase all moments prior to this moment.

273
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,090
Start anew as though we just met, you and me.

274
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,480
You poisoning me, I can forget it.

275
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,010
Since I am no longer in pain.

276
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,880
However.

277
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,540
You trying to kill that person.  I can't forgive.

278
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,090
I will think of it everytime I see you.

279
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,880
"This person tried to kill that person."

280
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,440
It's better to keep a feeling of such hidden.

281
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,810
Since it will be a great weakness of yours.

282
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,150
Let's go.

283
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,290
Where is she?

284
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,270
In there?

285
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,490
She went out.

286
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,070
To where?

287
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,600
To Prince Deokheung.

288
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,230
Prince Deokheung is being guarded by palace soldiers day and night.

289
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,610
Hence, let's sit and talk first.

290
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,640
Please sit.

291
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,220
That...

292
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,080
I can't.

293
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,290
I am unable to sit.

294
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,810
Were you always such a cheap ass?

295
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,180
Cheap ass?

296
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,930
An antidote that needed to be taken every three days for seven times total.

297
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,650
I knew from then.  The rest of my notebook.

298
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,970
You should just give all of it to me, but you go and save half of it?

299
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,840
So it was that.  The rest of the notebook.

300
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,770
Yea, that!

301
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,260
When are you going to give me the rest of what's mine?

302
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,520
Tell me the truth.

303
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,270
What's written in there?

304
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:10,150
That Prince Deokheung could never become king.

305
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,560
Hence you shouldn't dream in vain, and leave Goryeo.

306
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,720
How will you tell me properly?

307
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,230
If you give all the rest to me, I could let you know.

308
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,930
How about this?

309
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,560
The night we marry,

310
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,420
I will give it to you as a token.

311
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,320
It's dangerous.

312
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,910
Have them stop.  People are getting hurt!

313
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,710
That hand!

314
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,080
Move it.

315
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,010
Leave him be.

316
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,410
This man is a general.

317
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,180
I will ask you.

318
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,530
Did you say you would marry this person?

319
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,860
That's right.

320
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,920
Why?

321
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,140
That...

322
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,500
No matter how big your liver is,

323
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,590
this is the palace and I am the King's proxy.

324
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,550
Look at the eyes watching.

325
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,350
Be quiet.

326
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,580
I am talking to this person right now.

327
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,210
The moment you draw that sword,

328
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,000
it is treason for you.

329
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,940
For today, just go back.

330
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,490
I have my reason.

331
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,430
That so-called reason...

332
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,430
was it the price of my life?

333
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,680
Three days ago, in the morning,

334
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,790
I nearly died but lived.

335
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,880
Was that the condition this man put on you?

336
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,810
Or else, Imja...

337
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,940
would have no reason to do this.

338
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,490
Is that it?

339
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,630
If it is?

340
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,410
So that you can never menace this person...

341
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,600
Don't.

342
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,930
Don't do that.

343
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,440
Let's go.

344
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,420
Let's go... together.

345
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,950
The wedding will take place in over a month anyway.

346
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,110
And the gate to heaven will open before that so I can leave and that's the end.  I have thoughts too!

347
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,930
You called that thoughts?

348
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,930
Because there's some matter I need to accomplish here.

349
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:03,410
Tell me so we can do it together.

350
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,760
You wanted to flee from the start,

351
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,450
I'm aware of it.

352
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,210
From the very moment we met until now, Imja,

353
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,460
nearly died many times and not one day have you slept in ease.

354
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,000
You cried many times and that's all because of me.  I know that well, but...

355
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,490
still...

356
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,940
I can't leave you by the side of a punk like him.

357
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,450
Imja.

358
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,850
There's only a few days left before you will return.

359
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,800
Those days that are left,

360
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,140
I can't leave you by a punk like him, I'm saying.

361
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,630
Hence...

362
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,100
couldn't you be by my side?

363
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,700
Answering...

364
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,640
you won't?

365
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,770
I...

366
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,850
You know I came from heaven, right?

367
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,490
So even if I talk strangely,

368
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,070
you can roughly believe me, right?

369
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,410
Go ahead and speak.

370
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:15,830
The latter part of the notebook I so wanted to see.

371
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,260
In there, some person would fall into

372
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,130
a danger of death.  It was written in it.

373
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,340
And then?

374
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,160
Upon seeing that a few days ago,

375
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,300
I was able to save you.

376
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,360
That certain someone.

377
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,320
It was you, you see.

378
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,110
What are you talking about?  Why would I...

379
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,880
But I told you.

380
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,440
You are

381
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,590
very famous in heaven.

382
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,710
What I saw was only half.

383
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,550
But that rotten Prince Deokheung...

384
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,000
he's not giving me the remaining half.

385
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,570
But in there,

386
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,500
I think there might be another day recorded about you being in danger.

387
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,260
So I need that.

388
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,710
So then?

389
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,540
That's why you're saying you will remain here?

390
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,080
Just when I might die.  Because you want to know it?

391
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,720
In order for me to block it.

392
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,690
So then?

393
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,230
When does he say he will give you the latter?

394
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,790
Wedding day at night.

395
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,920
So you're going to wait until that night?

396
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,960
Before that, somehow...

397
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,250
How?

398
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,340
He is a punk that fed poison to Imja.

399
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,310
To a punk like him, so fearlessly...

400
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,570
marriage?

401
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,740
To save me?

402
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,950
Then do I feign ignorance when I can save you?
Just leave you be?

403
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,200
Think about it with our perspectives switched.

404
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,060
Right before I am to die, you can save me...

405
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,800
This hopeless person...

406
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,130
what am I to do with you.

407
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,860
<i>Subtitles brought to you by 'The Faith' team@Viki.com</i>

408
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,730
High Doctor is getting married to my Uncle...?

409
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,470
Did you know about this?

410
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:04,210
I heard it yesterday.
I couldn't believe it at all, so...

411
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,270
Since Your Majesty is staying out of the palace,
the engagement was done simply.

412
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,020
And he wished Your Majesty
to be the officiant for this marriage,

413
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,680
and hoped you would accept this request.

414
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,970
We came to escort you to the palace.

415
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,750
Why to the palace...?

416
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,550
Ah, I'm fine to be here, but why...?

417
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:34,560
Hey, I said I'm fine here.
Wait, wait!
Ah, I'm fine to be here, but why...?

418
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,890
Hey, I said I'm fine here.
Wait, wait!

419
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,940
We will move your belongings
you used here.

420
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,130
Returning to the palace?

421
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,780
If I say I want to return,
can I go?

422
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,550
If it's only returning to the palace, or...

423
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,320
Since my uncle, Prince Deokheung is sitting
on my throne with my permission,

424
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,450
I want to drag him out of there.

425
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,400
I understand.

426
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,650
Still, most of the Court subjects
would think of me

427
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,750
as a feeble-minded king who ran away.

428
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,110
You would need to filter out
those Court subjects one more time.

429
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,930
I heard that 2,000 of Royal Palace Guards
are supporting Prince Deokheung.

430
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,580
Those Royal Palace Guards,
I will try to bring them back to you.

431
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,340
Prince of the Court is still at Prince Deokheung's side, so his private soldiers are still threatening.

432
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,820
I will find a way.

433
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,580
Then, are you saying,
with 50 of Woodalchis,

434
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,180
you would fight against 2,000 of Royal Palace Guards and even the private soldiers of Prince of the Court?

435
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,710
I guess I need to find a way to not require us
to fight against them.

436
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,020
And these.

437
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,670
These are a few official positions.

438
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,580
I thought you would need them
when you make some move, General.

439
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,540
I heard about High Doctor.

440
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:10,680
What I'm saying is that I'm very anxious
if you would run away again with High Doctor.

441
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,010
Just for your information.

442
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,930
Oh, Lady Choi.

443
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,010
What on earth did you do?

444
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,720
I know...
I'm not even sure what I did...

445
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,870
Please take a seat.

446
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,430
Is the date set?

447
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,200
Well, the date or what-not,
I have no intention to get married.

448
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,520
For now, getting engaged,
but seeking the right timing to be disengaged.

449
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,320
Then, after that....

450
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,880
This is an engagement with Prince Deokheung, the only left Royal family except for His Majesty.

451
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,240
Disengagement?

452
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,010
Can't I?

453
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,760
Last night, did General Choi Young stop by?

454
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,260
Don't even talk about it.   Once he saw me,
he threw a fit,

455
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,310
and he said to come with him no matter what...

456
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,900
Come where?

457
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,960
So, I mean... run away...

458
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,020
If he runs away with a fiancee of the Royal family,
he will get a death sentence to have his limbs cut away..

459
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,730
I was sent by the Queen Her Highness,
to make you come to your senses.

460
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,370
Ah, wait!

461
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,270
So, I mean, I just said I would do that by words.

462
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,790
It's not like we had
some separate engagement ceremony,

463
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,220
and...

464
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,900
You've received the official letter
of marriage request.

465
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,250
I'm not good at Chinese characters,
so I didn't even think about reading it...

466
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,300
And you've already received
the wedding presents.

467
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,210
They just brought them without saying any...

468
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,920
Should I return them
although it's a bit late?

469
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,740
By the way, that guy, was he originally fearless,
ever since he was a little kid?

470
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,080
Do you mean Young?

471
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,440
When he was surrounded by soldiers,

472
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,820
how could he be like that,
seeing anything else?

473
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,960
If he ran away with me like that,

474
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,600
he would've become a criminal
committing a high treason.

475
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,670
That's right.

476
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,910
Ah, this guy, he's not listening to my plea,

477
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,600
nor my tears.
It's always just words that he would be careful!

478
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,440
Here I'm presenting the Royal Order
of His Majesty.

479
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,010
What are they talking about?

480
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:54,180
Wasn't Prince Deokheung here
the proxy for His Majesty?

481
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,760
We will receive His Majesty's Royal Order.

482
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,300
The King, His Majesty gave the order ;

483
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,070
From now on, all the Royal Orders would be proven by the new Royal Seal, "Goryeo Dynasty's New Seal".

484
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,290
As there should be only one Royal Seal
of one country,

485
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,170
he instructed to make sure there should
be no confusion in this subject.

486
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,810
The King, His Majesty, also gave this order;

487
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,050
From now on, His Majesty will resume
his governmental affairs,

488
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:28,720
and he has appreciated
Prince Deokheung's effort so far.

489
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,010
The Court subjects can attend
the morning meeting

490
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,880
in the separate palace
where His Majesty is staying now.

491
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,360
And the King, His Majesty, gave a new mission
to General Choi Young.

492
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,090
Choi Young will also have the position
in charge of Military Mobilization,

493
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,210
so he will stay in the palace
until the day when His Majesty returns to the palace,

494
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,740
and control the peace and order in the palace.

495
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,140
I will receive the Royal Order.

496
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,130
And I will execute the first step of that mission.

497
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,620
Prince Deokheung,

498
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,260
the seat you're sitting on now
is the throne that only His Majesty can sit on.

499
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,590
Please come down from it now.

500
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,840
As you know well,

501
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,400
I'm a very busy man.

502
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,780
As the knowledge of Heaven, which our High Doctor is giving me, is really huge, literally,

503
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,880
just writing it down itself is....

504
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,850
The King has changed his method.

505
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:47,200
Instead of coming back to the palace, he's thinking to pick things out of the palace, one by one.

506
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,210
Do you know whom he sent to command that?

507
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,510
Did that bastard appear again?

508
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:59,140
The first one that bastard would pick out
would be your High Doctor.

509
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,120
What should I do?

510
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,720
We have no other way.

511
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,530
I will strike the King.

512
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:11,210
However, I would need a justification to do so.

513
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:13,400
At least, he's a King of one country.

514
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,920
If the justification is too weak,
it will put me in a difficult position.

515
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,160
I will make that justification.

516
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,280
Ah, by the way,

517
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,760
did you say you set the wedding date
one and half month later from now?

518
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,790
Yes, so?

519
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:34,930
High Doctor said that the day that Heaven's gate opens is 2 months from now.

520
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:40,230
But somehow, I think she lied to us.

521
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:46,090
She's letting me know too many things
without any hesitance.

522
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,340
Then, the time when the Heaven's gate opens would be...

523
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:55,030
It can be...  soon.

524
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,770
Investigate the Royal Palace Guards and all Generals
who are at Prince Deokheung's side.

525
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,560
Yes.

526
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,890
There must be some groups which are resisting the order, so investigate that side, too.

527
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,700
I understand.

528
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,180
Dae Man, you should check thoroughly
where Prince Deokheung goes.

529
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,130
He is hiding something,
so I have to know where he's hiding that.

530
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:11,930
Yes, General!

531
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,210
Jeong Woo, you should take care of the private soldiers of Prince of the Court from Deokseong.

532
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,000
Yes.

533
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,970
My, you're working hard!

534
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:34,140
Evil one.
This is not someplace where you are welcome.

535
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,720
There's no such place!

536
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,370
They say the king who resides here doesn't block anyone.

537
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,350
Not even a slave, a butcher or a beggar.

538
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,920
The king is not blocking you.

539
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,700
But I'm going to have to block you a bit.

540
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,790
If someone trifles with me,
a lot of people will be hurt here.

541
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:28,190
<i>Subtitles brought to you by Faith Team @ viki.com</i>

542
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,670
What do you think?

543
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,450
In the interior and in the exterior each

544
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,920
there are 20 Woodalchi kids.

545
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,010
They are doing their reconnaissance separately.

546
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,390
Is that all of it?

547
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,660
That's as of right now.

548
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,510
What the... ?

549
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,530
It just requires the two of us.

550
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,240
That's what I'm saying.

551
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,520
Hey!

552
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,760
What are they doing here, huh?

553
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,570
It seems they came to spy.

554
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,170
What is it?

555
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,970
We thought we'd greet the king and came.

556
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,520
That's impossible.

557
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,470
Why?

558
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,930
Because I said no.

559
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:15,580
But I really want to have a real go at it today.

560
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,120
These days, my mood's been so-so too.

561
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,640
Let's go.

562
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,080
It's an explosive!

563
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,830
What are you looking for?

564
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,760
What are you doing here?

565
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,110
The book that you are looking for is not in here.

566
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,140
Really?

567
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:58,970
Then...

568
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,740
then in that room...

569
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,120
That rotten punk plays baduk in there by himself a lot.

570
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,720
He might have hidden it there.

571
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,020
Is there anything else in that book, that doesn't relate to me?

572
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,410
The days that tell when the Heaven's door will open for this world and the Heaven's world.

573
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,480
Anything that relates to you?

574
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,910
Is there anything that is written about you being in danger?

575
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,190
There is nothing like that!

576
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,330
If that is so...

577
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:16,280
then give up, that book.

578
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,530
But...

579
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:22,230
I am aware that Imja can see the future but never once have I coveted it.

580
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,070
Therefore...

581
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,670
give this up too.

582
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,790
This... is related to you.

583
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,660
I don't want to know.

584
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:35,320
It doesn't matter
about my death.

585
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,890
Then, what I can do for you,

586
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,560
would be nothing.

587
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,560
Soon, we have to part for real.

588
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,130
This isn't like others who fight and part,

589
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:58,830
but we can't go to each other again after drinking some alcohol either.

590
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:03,200
Nor is it possible to run to each other by coincidence.

591
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,210
It's to simply part for real.
Nor is it possible to run to each other by coincidence.

592
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:08,820
It's to simply part for real.

593
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,650
But still...

594
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,320
on the other side of the brushwood,

595
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,660
that you are living,

596
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,490
and living well.

597
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:30,380
I have to be able to think that so how can I give up?

598
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,770
What is it!  In this night?

599
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,620
Eleven with rankings higher than general are assembled together.

600
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,640
Each and all of them have recently become abundant in family fortune.

601
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,920
Though they participated in Jo Il Shin's revolt, they were not reprimanded afterwards.

602
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,790
It seems they are the core that joined hands with Prince Deokheung.

603
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:26,140
The fireling and the pipeling went to Hyeongo Village.

604
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,930
And then?

605
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:31,310
They came and counted how many we were and left.

606
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,970
It's prepared.

607
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,100
It's been a long time,

608
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,830
Ahn Jae.

609
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:51,100
Choi Young, you're the one full of ups and downs.

610
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,660
So then?  What is it that you wanted to meet this secretly?

611
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:01,140
Oh, these are my comrades cum friends.

612
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,230
Then we'll get straight to the point.

613
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,800
You guys,

614
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:12,160
you traitors who pointed your swords at His Majesty the King to drive him out of the palace.

615
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,410
Right?

616
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,830
That's right.

617
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:21,120
To handle you guys, nine of my subordinates died.

618
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,340
And we, just under thirty.

619
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,680
I don't know just how much money your superiors stuffed themselves with.

620
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,570
A bit much.

621
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,040
Want to come back?

622
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,800
His Majesty the King is waiting.

623
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,660
Just because a few of us want to go,

624
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,760
he'll have us?

625
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,480
What if I make it so you can come?  Will you come?

626
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:44,530
About when is the day of the revolt?

627
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:48,340
About when is the day of the revolt?

628
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,610
As quickly as possible, even by a day only.

629
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:07,320
The roster of newly subsumed royal armymen.

630
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,020
Two in the ranking of Joongrangjang (level 5) and five in ranking of Rangjang (level 6).

631
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,280
Create the promotion roster in advance.

632
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,960
So we can use them in proper time.

633
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

634
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,970
Oh right.

635
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,670
The royal army will move, you say?

636
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:32,190
If I were Choi Young, I would carry out that matter.

637
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,430
To mobilize the royal army.

638
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:42,820
Then, attack the Hyeongo Village before the royal army moves to the King's side will do?

639
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,340
Is that possible?

640
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,810
And the justification?

641
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:49,730
On that day he will attend my wedding ceremony.

642
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,410
A simple ceremony held at Bojae Temple.

643
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:59,770
Upon completion of the wedding ceremony, my wife and I will return to the palace, however...

644
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,180
about then, the King would be...

645
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:05,260
He would die in the hands of the band of robbers.

646
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:05,250
Since our kids are now getting ready to be dressed as a band of robbers.

647
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:10,610
Since our kids are now getting ready to be dressed as a band of robbers.

648
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:16,040
Upon completion of the state funeral, my queen would leave for a short trip.

649
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,840
You can take her then, to the heaven door.

650
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,820
I understand.

651
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,390
Then the wedding date...

652
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,200
Day after tomorrow.

653
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,050
Aren't you rushing too much?

654
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,050
As quickly as possible, even if only by a day.

655
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,670
There are many days left until the wedding day.

656
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,510
Isn't it okay to bring High Doctor back
until then?

657
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,010
There's no time.

658
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,130
You'd better be careful.

659
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,260
I am.  How can I be more careful?

660
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,720
Even if we are in the same palace,
I'm not even visiting her.

661
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,010
Don't lose your temper either, you punk!

662
00:54:55,050 --> 00:55:00,340
Make sure to drag that Deokheung bastard out as a traitor, then bring her back.

663
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,880
If you succeed before the next full moon day, then...

664
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,220
The next full moon day....

665
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,920
is the day when that person
would return (to Heaven).

666
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,670
Is that so?

667
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:22,380
Have you asked...

668
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,220
if she has thought about staying here....?

669
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,760
She doesn't have any.

670
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,970
Not even a piece of heart
thinking to stay here...

671
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:38,840
I guess so...
considering what she had to go through here....

672
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,840
Please just find out where those generals
of the Royal Army might gather.

673
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,050
If we capture them one by one, their subordinates would get involved, so it will become bothersome.

674
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,840
When those heads gather in one place,
I will take care of them at once.

675
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:55,880
By the way, when I think about
what High Doctor said...

676
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:47,530
<i> Translations brought to you by The Great Doctor Team at viki.com</i>

677
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,420
Let's end it here.

678
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,130
What is the matter?

679
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,670
You never intended to have a marriage in the first place.

680
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:00,590
You just needed me to make a deal
with that Ajussi, Prince of the Court.

681
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,380
Don't you want to be the queen?

682
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,840
Didn't I tell you that you can never be the king?

683
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,170
Does that mean you don't need the book anymore?

684
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,670
Yes!

685
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:19,870
This is a problem.

686
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:20,850
I give up.

687
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:24,260
Would you teach me what that book means?

688
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,630
You never know, I might give it away to you for free
if you convince me well.

689
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,660
That's my homework.

690
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,820
Homework?

691
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,330
Someone left me homework.

692
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:37,920
That person must have thought
that I would solve that homework no matter what.

693
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,520
Then, you are going to give it up?

694
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,230
For the remaining time,
I'm thinking to stick to his side.

695
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,820
I don't know what the question on that homework was, but I might be able to solve its answer anyway.

696
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,720
So you are going to break this engagement?

697
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,320
Sorry, then...

698
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,990
It will become like this.

699
00:57:56,990 --> 00:58:03,180
If you break this engagement, the reason will be because of your affair with the Woodalchi General.

700
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:09,360
In that case, for its punishment, you two would be demoted to the local provincial office's slave, if lightly,

701
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,270
or exiled.
But before that, Tae Hyeong. (Flogging)

702
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:17,300
Prince of the Court from Deokseong
wouldn't like that idea.

703
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:22,590
I can send you as a slave to that Prince of the Court from Deokseong.    Both of you.

704
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:28,090
As if that guy would get captured obediently
as a slave.

705
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:33,300
The King, His Majesty in Hyeongo Villiage.  The soldiers who are guarding there are just 50 people.

706
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,070
The Royal Army I have is 2,000 people.

707
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:39,010
If it becomes a matter of the life of the King,
he would kneel down.

708
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:43,920
That person Choi Young, like the last time,
he seemed to put the King ahead of you.

709
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,190
What is it?

710
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,980
They were the clothings of bandits.

711
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,180
More than hundreds.

712
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,510
- Dae Man.
- Yes.

713
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:36,020
I want you to run in the fastest speed
of your entire life.

714
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,260
- Go to His Majesty and tell him to start.
- Yes.

715
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:42,050
Dol Bae, go to Dan Ji and tell them that all operations would be moved up....

716
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,980
Lady Choi told me to relay this message.

717
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,550
Wait, what did you say?

718
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:56,970
There will be a wedding ceremony at Bojae Temple today.  Hence...

719
00:59:56,970 --> 01:00:00,170
Now, what's going on right now?

720
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:06,230
I will escort High Doctor.
Where do you want me to bring her?

721
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:10,050
At Pyeonjeon, His Highness Prince Deokheung and the statesmen are waiting.

722
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,990
They will head to Bojae Temple together.

723
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,750
However...

724
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:24,960
she can't go like this.  It is still a wedding to His Highness the Prince, so she can't go dressed as this.

725
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,340
Hence...

726
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:29,050
All preparations have been finished at Bojae Temple.

727
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:32,680
First to move then at at that place...

728
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,340
What should I do?

729
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,770
400 of our troops have crossed Doeunggye.

730
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:56,220
As soon as they reach Balgye, they will change their attire and begin immediate attack.

731
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,230
What are you doing here?

732
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,530
They should be waiting outside.

733
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:29,300
About now, Hyeongo Village that the King resides in, will be besieged by my troops.

734
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:34,840
I told them to escort the King here alive.

735
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,530
Today is the wedding and a good day.

736
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:42,230
Without the wedding, there wouldn't be the good.

737
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:47,770
Just go and get it done.

738
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,480
You were startled, right?

739
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,760
It isn't too far to reach Bojae Temple.

740
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,680
Together with out statesmen, let's feel the autumn wind and walk.

741
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:41,960
What are you doing there?

742
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,630
On a joyous day like this, you intend to cause mayhem.

743
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,490
Hyeongo Village will suffer an attack.

744
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,140
I know.
That is why there is no time.

745
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:12,250
You should go.

746
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:20,100
There is no other way!

747
01:03:45,380 --> 01:04:52,600
<i> Thank you for watching with us.</i>
