1
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,149
- Very good, Mr. Hermil
- Thank you.

2
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,687
- Your carriage is here, sir.
- Thank you.

3
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,223
- We'll continue tomorrow...
I'm sorry.

4
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,432
- It's late. I must go.
- All right. Until tomorrow.

5
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,572
Goodbye.

6
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,182
You were saying?

7
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,679
It's a myth that
English men are cold.

8
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,567
Isn't La Sperati singing?

9
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,608
- No, next Tuesday.
- Pity, I won't be here.

10
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:37,015
- They say she's admirable.
- As a singer or a woman?

11
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,591
I know nothing about opera.

12
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,451
If our Princess knew

13
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,251
how few of guests
come for the music.

14
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,595
She knows full well.

15
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,590
It's her way of inflicting
penance for our sins.

16
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,593
You come hereto court
Countess Teresa Raffo,

17
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,938
you get 1 Mozart, 2 Schuberts
and 4 Liszts as penance.

18
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,848
- Pity you're so late.
- It's my fault, Princess...

19
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,217
entirely mine.

20
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,688
I have no doubt.

21
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,394
You've missed a Mozart
and a beautiful Liszt.

22
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,531
- I'm sorry.
- Come and sit with me.

23
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,372
Thank you, Princess.

24
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,785
I'm afraid I can't stay
to the end.

25
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,586
It's a pity you're leaving
so soon.

26
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,184
She is an extraordinary
pianist.

27
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,886
Yes, I think so too.

28
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:26,894
Goodbye.

29
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,174
Where are you going?

30
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,987
I won't stay if she's here.

31
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,749
- I didn't know you'd come.
- Yes, I know.

32
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,657
Goodbye.
Enjoy yourselves.

33
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,661
- Teresa... please.
- Will you leave with me?

34
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,692
You know I can't.

35
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,529
Either you leave
with me now

36
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,172
or you'll never see me again,
I mean that.

37
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,110
My dear Tullio,

38
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,912
you can't let our most
beautiful guest leave.

39
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,552
It doesn't depend on me,
Prince.

40
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,455
But my evening
has just begun.

41
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,994
Tell Count Egano
I'm waiting for him.

42
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,630
Never mind, here he is.

43
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,899
Dear Stefano.

44
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,436
Shall we go?

45
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,647
Let's go in before that
fanatic starts another piece.

46
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,583
My wife takes offense
if I'm not in the room.

47
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:02,121
After all, it takes
so little to please her.

48
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,836
- I'll come for you later.
- What?

49
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,777
No, I'll send the carriage.

50
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,442
I won't be back.
I'm not feeling well.

51
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,515
- I'll come with you.
- Don't complicate matters.

52
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,065
Come in.

53
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,375
As you can see,
I know you quite well.

54
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,113
I was sure you'd come.

55
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,419
Before going out again
I chose to wait for you

56
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,420
rather that risk
finding you here

57
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,658
when I got back.

58
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,126
Give me back my keys.

59
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,192
Be reasonable.
I couldn't leave with you.

60
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,796
For once my wife asked
me to accompany her.

61
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,744
Why didn't you tell me
you'd be there?

62
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,413
I went because
I knew you'd be there.

63
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:36,049
It's time we faced this situation.
Don't you agree?

64
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,849
For months you've skilfully
succeeded, like a conjurer,

65
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,926
in preventing me from
seeing how things really are.

66
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,790
- So I took the initiative.
- Initiative?

67
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,734
Seeing what?
That I'm married?

68
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,468
You've always known that.

69
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,098
- Of course.
- So?

70
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,036
From what you say,

71
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,473
your rapport with your wife
is only a formal one.

72
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,979
- Precisely.
- That's not true.

73
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,947
And it's obvious
when you're together.

74
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,815
You're like all
the bourgeois husbands

75
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,855
of this world, my dear.

76
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,991
They swear to their lovers
they've rejected their wives

77
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,357
and do the same
with their wives.

78
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,927
I won't accept
such pettiness.

79
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,966
You know I'm a free,
liberated woman

80
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,302
and not only in word,
like you.

81
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,506
You're jealous of her.

82
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,544
I won't share a man
with another woman.

83
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,512
Not even with his wife.

84
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:44,082
You're not sharing me
and you know that.

85
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:48,515
All I think of is you.
You're always inside me.

86
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,657
I feel your presence
constantly. It's persistent...

87
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,125
even hostile.

88
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,263
I'm going outwith Egano.

89
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,204
Run along to your wife.

90
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,039
Leave me.

91
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,710
I won't leave you.

92
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,439
You're staying with me.

93
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,163
You're still awake?

94
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,902
You said you weren't
feeling well, so...

95
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,067
how silly of me...

96
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,464
I became anxious.

97
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,941
I waited by the window
for your return.

98
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:46,074
You know what I was doing?
Writing to you.

99
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,114
But since you're here...

100
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,358
I'm going to Florence.
I don't know for how long.

101
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:03,025
This time it's serious.
I had to tell you.

102
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,099
You're leaving forever?

103
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,032
Well... forever...

104
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,462
What big words.

105
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,102
Listen, Giuliana,
even though...

106
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:18,506
even though I've never
spoken to you about it,

107
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,515
I'm sure that
at some stage,

108
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,281
some compassionate soul

109
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,023
must have informed
you of my infidelities.

110
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,927
I didn't tell you myself

111
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,427
because they were
insignificant affairs,

112
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,929
and because of our pact,

113
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,903
from the time
you agreed to marry me.

114
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,798
Love is there while it lasts

115
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,639
then it's replaced by respect,
affection, friendship,

116
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,742
common interests...

117
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,614
if all that is possible,
of course.

118
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,514
But I must assume
that it's our case,

119
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,578
since you've accepted,
without reacting,

120
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,425
the situation between us
for quite some time.

121
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,426
As you said, they were
insignificant affairs.

122
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,560
That's why I tried
to ignore them.

123
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:12,859
Marriage...

124
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,803
Yes, our marriage was to
be defended at all costs...

125
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,570
even from our own
resentment. Correct?

126
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:24,345
And you were right.
You're been wonderful.

127
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,451
Because, even if
my love for you...

128
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,111
has waned,

129
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,487
as inevitably happens,

130
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,454
my affection and respect
have but increased.

131
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,425
I'm fond of you
and respect you...

132
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,456
like a beloved sister

133
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,468
without whom I could
no longer live.

134
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,506
I'd suffer greatly

135
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:53,541
but naturally you'd have
every right to leave me.

136
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,844
Will you stay with me
and help me?

137
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,513
H ow?

138
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,049
By Putting up with me.

139
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:06,013
By facing a situation
which, by society's standards.

140
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,949
Would certainly
be criticized.

141
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,862
- The woman I love...
- Teresa Raffo?

142
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,364
- Yes, Teresa.
- She's a widow, she's free.

143
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,966
What prevents you
going to her?

144
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:23,465
I didn't mention
marrying her.

145
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,037
She's a beautiful
sensual woman.

146
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,913
I desire her.

147
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,485
No woman has ever
possessed me

148
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,489
as she has.

149
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,810
What is this? I arrive
and they're leaving?

150
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,880
Anyone home?

151
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,483
Federico.

152
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,280
You're all leaving when
I have 3 day's furlough?

153
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,284
No, only me.

154
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,783
Where are you going?

155
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,788
- How long do you have?
- Three days.

156
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,791
Actually, three and a half.

157
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,398
Listen... I'm up to my neck
in problems,

158
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,069
or good fortune,
if you like.

159
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,304
I'm leaving Giuliana
by herself...

160
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,372
not that I want to impose,

161
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,213
but I'll feel better
knowing you're with her.

162
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,043
Wait. I'd like to spend
my three days in Rome,

163
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,411
not with my sister-in-law.

164
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,452
- She's adorable, but...
- No, do as you please.

165
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,058
I only need to know
you're around.

166
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,929
I mean,
if before going out,

167
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,890
you tell her your plans
for the evening,

168
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,030
Giuliana will be happy.

169
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,898
This is a very delicate
time for her.

170
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,343
Does anyone else live here?
The house looks so big.

171
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,776
Or she'll be
so disappointed.

172
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,780
I promised to show her
one of Rome's finest homes...

173
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,349
It is beautiful, but...

174
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:22,792
No, it's not.
This villa was built for my mother.

175
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,790
She wanted lots of
greenery even in the city.

176
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,398
My father did his best
to please her

177
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,463
but when he died,
she returned to the country

178
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,263
where it's much greener.

179
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,302
Then my brother married
and came to live here.

180
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,406
I kept these rooms
to be more independent.

181
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:47,080
- So it's not the main part.
- Yes, it is. I assure you.

182
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,288
Federico.

183
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,694
What's wrong?

184
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,063
What's wrong with you?
Giuliana!

185
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,135
That's it. Help me.

186
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,734
- Call the governess.
- Right away, sir.

187
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:24,820
She hasn't fainted.
She's taken something.

188
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:27,458
Are you alone in the house?

189
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:31,858
No. They've gone to bed.
I was too...

190
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,328
Forgive me.

191
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,300
I was depressed and took
something to help me sleep.

192
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:42,071
Instead of relaxing
I've become terribly anxious.

193
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,440
Terribly afraid.

194
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,577
I didn't want to be alone.

195
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,075
I'm here.
How are you feeling?

196
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,980
It's nothing.
Such a silly thing.

197
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,413
- Do you feel better now?
- Yes.

198
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,416
I'm sorry to inconvenience you.

199
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,289
Lie down a bit longer.

200
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,197
This is Filippo d'Arborio,
the writer.

201
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,267
See what important
friends I have?

202
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,139
Ulderico Guinigi
and Miss Elviretta.

203
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,036
My sister-in-law, Giuliana.

204
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,436
- Hello.
- My apologies.

205
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,011
I've ruined your dinner.
Do continue.

206
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,679
You mustn't be alone
tonight.

207
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,412
Come on.

208
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,793
Tell us when you're ready
for bed.

209
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,790
Or go to sleep here
lulled by our voices.

210
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,399
- When we were boarders...
- Which school?

211
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,002
I was poor.

212
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,841
My parents couldn't afford
my studies.

213
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,110
I paid my way by tutoring
the younger pupils.

214
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,109
Federico was one of them.

215
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,247
And I always fell asleep.

216
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,915
That's right.

217
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:06,258
As soon as I started
talking, he'd doze off.

218
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,091
He says the tone of my voice
was to blame.

219
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,226
I would be very pleased

220
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,293
if you
managed to sleep, too.

221
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,980
Breakfast is sewed.

222
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:16,025
What a beautiful scent.
Are they tuberoses?

223
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,053
At this time of year!

224
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,195
How did you find them?

225
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,460
You're so sweet.

226
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,411
"I await you.
Stefano Egano. "

227
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,345
The idiot. How dare he?

228
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:49,286
You shouldn't read
other people's letters.

229
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,062
You really are silly.

230
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:58,766
If I've slighted anyone,
it's him, not you.

231
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,366
I promised Egano
I'd watch his horse's race.

232
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,444
But I'm here with you.

233
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,877
What are you complaining
about?

234
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,492
I was hoping to see you
at the races yesterday.

235
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,662
My horses distinguished
themselves.

236
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:28,362
There are too many people.
I'm afraid of crowds.

237
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,429
They're racing in
the steeplechase tomorrow.

238
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:35,835
I can get you seats
at the finishing line.

239
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,336
I'm afraid I can't go.

240
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:44,515
In case you change
your mind...

241
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:47,950
I assure you
the countess won't.

242
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:53,424
- I'd like her to tell me.
- I'm telling you.

243
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,059
If you change your mind...

244
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm at your disposal.

245
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,599
Very well.

246
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:04,486
Egano's friend say
he's left for Rome

247
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,187
and so has she, apparently.

248
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,031
She's broken off with Tullio.

249
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,896
You did well to come.

250
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,835
Let the tongues wag.

251
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:17,806
Don't let them pity you.

252
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:22,438
Never accept the role
of the poor abandoned wife.

253
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,077
You're hereto disprove that.

254
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:22,866
I didn't want you here
because Teresa's coming.

255
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,336
My train was late.

256
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:32,340
While I dueled with that
fool in Florence, she left.

257
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,340
I must see her again.

258
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,884
She's treacherous,
elusive and a liar.

259
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:47,155
The moment you think
she's all yours,

260
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,155
she escapes you.

261
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:52,828
She's already pursuing
other desires.

262
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:57,358
I must find the strength
to break off with her.

263
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:01,161
- And you must help me.
- What can I do?

264
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,802
I don't know. Many things.

265
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:07,837
Convince me
not to see her again.

266
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:11,380
No one can convince you...

267
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,881
least of all me.

268
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:16,417
That's not true.

269
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:19,315
You see, the most
dangerous thing for me

270
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:22,321
is that my frustration
makes me feel so unhappy

271
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:25,390
but at the same time
I feel alive, vital...

272
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:31,766
It's the first time
I'm in such a situation.

273
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:36,871
One does sell one's soul
in exchange for youth

274
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,266
and one is defenseless
in love.

275
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:42,642
You talk as if
I'd never existed.

276
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:48,247
You're right,
I'm being unfair.

277
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,850
I'm sorry.
Be patient with me.

278
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:54,015
As you would with
a sick person.

279
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:57,290
Someone who indulges
in his illness.

280
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:38,122
- Was that you singing?
- Yes.

281
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:43,331
You're going out?

282
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:46,461
- Where are you going?
- To Di Castro's auction.

283
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:28,306
I can't pin my veil.
Will you help me please?

284
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:39,523
You have a new perfume.
What is it?

285
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:42,894
Crab-apple.
It's an English perfume.

286
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:57,066
<i>"The Flame".</i>

287
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:05,345
“To Giuliana Hermil,
Turns Eburnea,

288
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:07,946
"I humbly dedicate...
Filippo D'Arborio. "

289
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:11,083
- Aren't you going out?
- You know D'Arborio?

290
00:30:11,512 --> 00:30:15,085
- When did you meet him?
- When your brother was here.

291
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:16,884
- Have you read it?
- Yes.

292
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:20,332
I skimmed through it
at the Club.

293
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:23,763
A mediocre writer,
don't you agree?

294
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:24,760
No.

295
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:27,671
His style is so pompous,
so emphatic.

296
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:30,301
It's quite unbearable.

297
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:32,472
How can you say that?

298
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:36,944
His style is extraordinary.
It's like music.

299
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:40,077
You can't judge
a man like him

300
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:42,476
by just skimming through
his book.

301
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,383
You take it to heart.

302
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:48,351
He may be a great writer
but he's ill-mannered.

303
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:50,490
You must give me that.

304
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:53,354
The dedication he wrote you
is not only stilted

305
00:30:53,753 --> 00:30:56,165
but also uncalled for,
if one considers

306
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:59,499
it's addressed to a
lady he only met ones.

307
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,107
I saw him again
after our first meeting.

308
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,737
Are you taking the carriage?

309
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,607
No, I'd rather walk.

310
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,717
I'll see you later.

311
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,466
Now as you've all seen

312
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:34,799
4500 lire. Congratulations,
Countess Raffo.

313
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:35,939
Thank you.

314
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:39,335
Now there's a fabulous
dove-shaped brooch

315
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,371
in diamonds and rubies,

316
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:45,079
valued at 5 or 6000.
But I'll start at 1000.

317
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,063
Things are warming up.
Good evening, Mr. Hermil.

318
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,509
- Good evening, Madam.
- Good evening, Emilio.

319
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:55,849
- Is Mr Tullio in?
- No, Madame, he went out.

320
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:08,226
Tell the kitchen I've eaten.
Good night.

321
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,747
I've spent endless nights
outside here

322
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:00,379
looking up
at your windows.

323
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:03,112
I know.

324
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:06,049
I saw you once.

325
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,557
And you didn't call me?

326
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:14,161
Why are you so cruel
to me?

327
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:20,270
You're one of those men
who make women suffer.

328
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:24,702
You're selfish.

329
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,809
Proud.

330
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:29,336
Despotic.

331
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:31,883
The domineering lover.

332
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,716
If you knew how hard
it's been

333
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,917
to resist calling you,

334
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:41,989
but I succeeded.

335
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,523
And you had to come
looking for me today.

336
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,268
But I didn't come
looking for you today.

337
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:59,734
I went there by chance.

338
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:04,280
- That's not true.
- It is. I swear.

339
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:08,108
I hadn't left the house
for days on end.

340
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:12,422
My wife said she was
going to the auction, so...

341
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,889
Your wife was there?

342
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,829
No, she wasn't.
I assure you.

343
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:23,894
I had nothing to do either,
and I got there early.

344
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,895
And I'm usually late
wherever I go.

345
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:31,365
I saw every single person
who walked in.

346
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,377
Oh God, I'm ruined.

347
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,050
So your wife lies to you.

348
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,050
She deceives you.

349
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:46,424
Maybe she has a lover.

350
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:53,356
I'm sorry. I'm only joking.

351
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,664
I only saw those
who were already there.

352
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:04,700
I didn't see the people
who arrived later.

353
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,407
I didn't even see you.

354
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:22,120
- Good evening, sir.
- Is my wife back?

355
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:25,018
Yes, an hour ago
but then she left again.

356
00:36:25,418 --> 00:36:29,059
She went to catch
the 8.30 p. m. train.

357
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:33,302
She said she was going
to visit your mother.

358
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:36,401
I think she left you
a note in the study.

359
00:36:58,084 --> 00:37:00,086
I'll be with you shortly.

360
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,288
You're the only punctual
man in Rome.

361
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,929
This is Mr Filippo d'Arborio.

362
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:12,264
I'm Tullio Hermil.

363
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:16,238
- An academic match?
- With pleasure.

364
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:32,417
Tell me if I've done well.

365
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:35,924
Who do you want next to you
at dinner?

366
00:38:36,215 --> 00:38:39,924
On your right the Princess
of Fondi. And on your left?

367
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,256
It's up to you.

368
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,934
- Do you like that book?
- No.

369
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:52,068
I do, very much.
I also like the author.

370
00:38:52,265 --> 00:38:54,973
I invited him tonight
but he's not at Rome.

371
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:56,403
D'Arborio?

372
00:38:57,604 --> 00:39:00,210
He'll get in touch
as soon as he gets back.

373
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:05,182
I'll organize another dinner.
I'd like you to meet him.

374
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:08,716
- I've met him, thank you.
- What's wrong with you?

375
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:12,755
- Are you in a bad mood?
- Not at all.

376
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:18,865
Then will you approve
my seating arrangements?

377
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:28,341
Remember we must give
the Dampierres

378
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,270
an answer tonight.

379
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:35,312
Shall we go to Paris
or not?

380
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:39,046
You're the one
who's been invited.

381
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:42,317
I'll go if you come too.

382
00:39:43,316 --> 00:39:45,990
What else
do you want to do?

383
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:48,390
D'Arborio's dinner, trips...

384
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,261
You're a bachelor again,

385
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:56,496
and I'm taking advantage
of it.

386
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:05,649
I'm sitting here.

387
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,010
The Ambassador on my right,

388
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,453
and I've put Dampierre
on my left.

389
00:40:11,644 --> 00:40:12,782
All right?

390
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,814
Yes, it's all right.

391
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:22,433
Dampierre is next to me

392
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:25,962
so I can tell him we'll
be going to Paris next week.

393
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,071
All right.

394
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:37,514
Thank you.

395
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,302
- How are you, Giuseppe?
- Well, thank you.

396
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,448
Tullio! My dear Tullio.

397
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,247
Mama, how are you?

398
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:18,418
You're all alike.
You tum up unexpectedly.

399
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:23,191
- Giuliana?
- She was expecting you.

400
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,264
- Elvira, where's Madam?
- In the garden.

401
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:33,365
Go and tell her
Mr Tullio is here.

402
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,742
What does Giuliana
usually do?

403
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:47,742
She has some friends, so...

404
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:48,777
Friends?

405
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,746
Yes, friends from Rome
staying with the Torrigianis.

406
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:54,420
Giuliana says
they're very nice.

407
00:41:54,814 --> 00:41:56,851
At least she occupies
her time.

408
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,854
You see, I never go out.

409
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:01,892
I told her invite
whoever she likes

410
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:04,397
but she'd rather go out.

411
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:08,298
It'll be a nice surprise
for her to see you here.

412
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,771
Here's Giuliana.

413
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,888
- You look very well.
- We weren't expecting you.

414
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,958
To be honest, I wasn't
planning on coming.

415
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,456
I was at station
with a ticket to Paris

416
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:38,363
then I saw a train for here
and changed my plans.

417
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:45,336
I knew Tullio was crazy
but not to this extent.

418
00:42:48,534 --> 00:42:49,376
Wait.

419
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:54,946
Do you mind if we occupy
a room in the left wing too?

420
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,281
Tullio reads at night

421
00:42:57,676 --> 00:42:59,815
and I wake up very early

422
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:03,149
so we'd rather have
separate rooms.

423
00:43:04,517 --> 00:43:07,396
As you wish.
There are plenty of rooms.

424
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:10,597
Go to the other wing.

425
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:22,008
- Would you like some?
- No, thank you.

426
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:41,362
- Been to Villa Lilla?
- No, I haven't.

427
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:44,930
- Why is that?
- I haven't been there.

428
00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:47,362
We should discuss
Villa Lilla.

429
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,399
There's an Englishman,
an ex-diplomat,

430
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,435
who'd like to buy it.

431
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,008
I'm told I could get
an excellent price.

432
00:43:57,403 --> 00:44:00,850
I'm against selling,
but we could rent it.

433
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,777
With all the money spent
to renovate it

434
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,781
when, as newlyweds,

435
00:44:06,178 --> 00:44:08,920
you said you'd spend
six months a year there.

436
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:11,358
I never believed you.

437
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,220
If we rent it we could
pay for its upkeep,

438
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:17,358
if nothing else.

439
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:19,827
Uninhabited houses suffer

440
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,501
and deteriorate
before their time.

441
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:27,507
Well, think it over.

442
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:30,279
It's not for the money.

443
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,082
To me, that will always be
your home.

444
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:37,283
Mother is right.

445
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:40,214
We should at least
go and see it.

446
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,797
If you're free tomorrow
shall we go to Villa Lilla?

447
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:57,333
Welcome, Mr Tullio.
My respects, Madam.

448
00:44:57,696 --> 00:44:59,198
Hello, Callisto.

449
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:05,847
Water the horse
and feed him.

450
00:45:06,238 --> 00:45:08,240
I've been airing the house
for two weeks.

451
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:11,087
I knew you were at
the Badiola.

452
00:45:11,477 --> 00:45:14,856
I've been waiting
or the weather to improve.

453
00:45:15,247 --> 00:45:16,851
Very good, sir.

454
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:13,043
You should listen to
your mother and rent it.

455
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:19,349
Yes.

456
00:46:19,979 --> 00:46:22,459
It would be most
reasonable thing to do.

457
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:26,257
The English diplomat
would look after it well.

458
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:30,123
But the idea upsets me.

459
00:46:56,115 --> 00:46:58,686
Doesn't it you?

460
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:44,968
You seem just as
hesitant and fearful

461
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:48,100
as when we came here
for the first time.

462
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:51,499
There were the same flowers.

463
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:54,044
The same perfume.

464
00:48:54,233 --> 00:48:57,442
That's right, it was
the same season.

465
00:50:36,836 --> 00:50:39,874
Let's try to be
two new people

466
00:50:40,674 --> 00:50:43,712
who meet here
for the first time.

467
00:50:45,344 --> 00:50:47,756
It's up to us to try.

468
00:50:48,847 --> 00:50:50,690
If we don't succeed,

469
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:54,621
we'll sink back into
unhappiness and misery.

470
00:50:55,254 --> 00:50:57,097
That's not possible.

471
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,201
Don't torment me.

472
00:51:00,293 --> 00:51:01,772
Why not?

473
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:05,802
You've been my wife,
my sister,

474
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:08,737
But you've never been
my mistress.

475
00:51:11,103 --> 00:51:12,980
It's different, you know.

476
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:14,946
Very different.

477
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:18,522
Without embarrassment,

478
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:20,452
with no false modesty,

479
00:51:21,848 --> 00:51:24,488
without holding back.

480
00:51:35,027 --> 00:51:37,166
Love is that too.

481
00:51:37,363 --> 00:51:39,070
Especially that.

482
00:51:44,136 --> 00:51:46,582
And I've never
taught you.

483
00:51:48,507 --> 00:51:50,544
It's been my fault.

484
00:51:50,743 --> 00:51:52,723
I was wrong.

485
00:51:59,485 --> 00:52:02,329
Tell me you want
to make love with me.

486
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:05,224
Tell me you want to.
Ask me.

487
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:08,667
Ask me.
Ask me, my love.

488
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:37,490
I was getting worried.
I wanted to send someone.

489
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:42,466
- How are you?
- Well.

490
00:52:44,563 --> 00:52:47,476
- Shall I accompany you?
- No, thank you.

491
00:52:51,837 --> 00:52:53,817
Giuliana wasn't very well.

492
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,880
I wanted to sleep at
Villa Lilla but she didn't.

493
00:52:57,276 --> 00:52:59,984
- What was wrong with her?
- Nothing serious.

494
00:53:00,113 --> 00:53:02,389
Perhaps she caught cold.

495
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:08,328
You're so right. It's a shame
to leave Villa Lilla empty.

496
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:11,463
But no English diplomats.
We'll go and live there,

497
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:14,229
at least a few months
of the year.

498
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:17,769
Yes, I know you don't
believe me, but you'll see.

499
00:53:18,164 --> 00:53:19,973
The smell of the lilacs...

500
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,703
Maybe that's why
Giuliana took ill.

501
00:53:23,101 --> 00:53:25,445
It was such a heavy
perfume.

502
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:28,415
I'll tell her to stay in bed.
It would be wiser.

503
00:53:28,607 --> 00:53:30,484
And I'll call the doctor.

504
00:53:30,677 --> 00:53:33,419
I wanted to last week
but Giuliana refused.

505
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:37,651
Tell Giuseppe to get the gig
and go to Dr Milani.

506
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,894
I'd be most grateful
if he came tonight.

507
00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:43,726
Calm down,
Giuliana is better now.

508
00:53:44,023 --> 00:53:47,527
It was nothing serious.
There's no need to worry.

509
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,440
She forbade me to tell you
until she was sure

510
00:53:52,631 --> 00:53:55,373
but, as there's no doubt now,
I'll tell you,

511
00:53:55,768 --> 00:53:59,375
so you won't be
as silly as you were today

512
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:02,015
by taking her out
in the gig.

513
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:05,446
Giuliana is pregnant.

514
00:54:10,183 --> 00:54:12,026
- Pregnant?
- Yes.

515
00:54:12,418 --> 00:54:15,194
- Did she tell you?
- No, but I know.

516
00:54:15,388 --> 00:54:18,096
She's had quite a few
turns like today's.

517
00:54:18,491 --> 00:54:20,266
Nausea, dizzy spells...
you know.

518
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,601
So I asked her and she
said she hoped she was.

519
00:54:25,064 --> 00:54:27,601
But she wanted to be sure
before telling you

520
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,844
so as not to disappoint
you, of course.

521
00:54:31,036 --> 00:54:33,812
I've begged her
to see the doctor

522
00:54:34,006 --> 00:54:37,749
because she won't listen
to my advice.

523
00:54:38,544 --> 00:54:40,956
She should be in her
third month.

524
00:54:41,146 --> 00:54:43,922
But don't betray me.
Wait for her to tell you.

525
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:45,925
She made me promise.

526
00:54:47,586 --> 00:54:49,588
I'm so happy.

527
00:54:50,223 --> 00:54:54,137
You've made me wait
so long for this moment.

528
00:54:54,526 --> 00:54:56,597
Now she must be careful.

529
00:54:56,796 --> 00:55:00,107
The first months are the
most dangerous for her.

530
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:04,711
She's so frail,
our dear, dear child.

531
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:33,143
Good night, Mama.

532
00:55:33,266 --> 00:55:36,509
I'm going upstairs so if
she wakes up I'll hear her.

533
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:38,647
You'll wait for the doctor?

534
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,614
If Giuseppe had found him
he'd be here by now.

535
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:47,050
- If you need anything...
- No, thank you. Good night.

536
00:56:14,173 --> 00:56:16,380
Tullio.

537
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:22,216
Don't leave.
I'm afraid of being alone.

538
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:45,607
What have you taken?
A sleeping draught?

539
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:21,182
Tullio.

540
00:57:21,707 --> 00:57:24,017
Did you sleep here?

541
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,449
What happened?

542
00:57:26,912 --> 00:57:29,586
You said not to
leave you alone.

543
00:57:30,382 --> 00:57:32,726
I did? When?

544
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,561
Don't you remember?

545
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:41,469
I took a sleeping draught
last night.

546
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,067
Maybe I took more
than usual.

547
00:57:44,463 --> 00:57:46,943
You take sleeping droughts?
Does the doctor know?

548
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:48,237
Yes.

549
00:57:49,001 --> 00:57:51,038
Show me what you take.

550
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:54,944
I can't remember
where I put it.

551
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:57,520
Wait.

552
00:58:08,688 --> 00:58:11,601
I think...
I must have finished it,

553
00:58:13,259 --> 00:58:15,535
and thrown out the bottle.

554
00:58:18,063 --> 00:58:21,044
Is what my mother
told me true?

555
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:24,679
That you're pregnant?

556
00:58:36,382 --> 00:58:38,328
Yes, it's true.

557
00:58:41,253 --> 00:58:44,928
I wanted to tell you.
I tried to yesterday.

558
00:58:45,324 --> 00:58:47,895
- Is that why you left Rome?
- Yes.

559
00:58:48,294 --> 00:58:50,900
- But I didn't know then.
- And he followed you.

560
00:58:51,297 --> 00:58:53,299
Followed me? Who?

561
00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:56,978
It was all over
before I came here.

562
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,275
Before I knew I was...

563
00:59:00,673 --> 00:59:02,311
like this.

564
00:59:03,175 --> 00:59:07,146
I had found the strength
to overcome my confusion.

565
00:59:09,048 --> 00:59:11,085
I was very lonely.

566
00:59:11,284 --> 00:59:12,854
Very sad.

567
00:59:13,252 --> 00:59:16,756
I'm not justifying myself
or accusing you.

568
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,168
<i>I'm in despair.</i>

569
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:24,507
In despair.

570
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:30,212
But I come last.
What about you?

571
00:59:35,574 --> 00:59:38,987
The same right applied
to you as to me.

572
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:42,090
We were two friends.

573
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:45,293
Two free people.

574
00:59:48,488 --> 00:59:52,197
- You could too.
- I wasn't to claim a right.

575
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:54,265
I never felt I had one.

576
00:59:56,762 --> 01:00:00,209
I swore before God
to be your wife forever.

577
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,007
It was different for you.

578
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:07,277
But I...

579
01:00:16,182 --> 01:00:18,856
There's one thing
I want to know.

580
01:00:19,051 --> 01:00:21,759
The only really
important thing.

581
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:25,232
I'm no longer interested
in our past live together.

582
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,436
But I've changed a lot
in these last few days.

583
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:32,508
And yesterday...
no, let me finish.

584
01:00:32,898 --> 01:00:35,174
Yesterday I found you again.

585
01:00:36,503 --> 01:00:40,508
And I believed you'd like
to start from scratch.

586
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:45,351
For a moment I left
that all I'd been through

587
01:00:46,012 --> 01:00:49,186
was nothing but
a dream, a nightmare.

588
01:00:50,382 --> 01:00:54,626
We were there, you and I,
just like after our marriage.

589
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,922
Are you being sincere?

590
01:01:00,527 --> 01:01:03,269
No one must suspect
anything.

591
01:01:06,165 --> 01:01:09,635
Why? Do you want me
to stay with you?

592
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:12,339
Yes.

593
01:01:18,745 --> 01:01:20,656
Seeing you're awake...

594
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,694
I've signed up for
the championship.

595
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,731
<i>I need some lessons so</i> I
<i>won't discredit the family.</i>

596
01:01:34,127 --> 01:01:36,767
- Coming down?
- I'll join you shortly.

597
01:01:37,163 --> 01:01:39,700
- Hello, Giuliana.
- Hello, Federico.

598
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:50,684
Touche. Bravo.

599
01:01:51,077 --> 01:01:54,183
You should sign up
instead of me.

600
01:01:54,847 --> 01:01:57,350
Now I'll try harder.
Watch out.

601
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:27,616
Careful, boys.
Don't hurt yourselves.

602
01:02:31,517 --> 01:02:32,655
Stop it.

603
01:02:33,819 --> 01:02:35,560
Are you crazy?

604
01:02:36,488 --> 01:02:39,435
We're off the board.
I want a return match.

605
01:02:41,894 --> 01:02:44,841
- Not now. I'm tired.
- That's enough, boys.

606
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:49,408
The doctor is here.
You'd better see him.

607
01:02:49,802 --> 01:02:51,611
Everything's all right,

608
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:55,650
but he wants Giuliana to
stay in bed for a few days.

609
01:02:56,709 --> 01:02:58,780
Anyway, he'll tell you.
Go up.

610
01:02:59,178 --> 01:03:02,182
No, I'm sweaty.
I want to change.

611
01:03:02,982 --> 01:03:05,394
I'd keep him waiting.
Apologize for me.

612
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:20,874
It's no use pretending
I don't know anything.

613
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:23,975
As you can imagine.
Mama told me right away.

614
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:25,808
I'm really pleased.

615
01:03:26,206 --> 01:03:29,187
That way she'll stop
nagging me to marry.

616
01:03:29,975 --> 01:03:32,251
The heir is guaranteed.
Congratulations.

617
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:34,852
May I congratulate
Giuliana too?

618
01:03:35,215 --> 01:03:36,956
No, leave it for now.

619
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:41,295
Mama should've kept quite.
Giuliana isn't well.

620
01:03:41,688 --> 01:03:45,431
- She may lose the child.
- But the doctor said...

621
01:03:47,226 --> 01:03:49,832
Even last time
Giuliana fell pregnant

622
01:03:52,231 --> 01:03:54,404
the doctor said all was well

623
01:03:55,367 --> 01:03:57,210
but it wasn't.

624
01:04:01,874 --> 01:04:04,650
If you left now against
the doctor's orders.

625
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:06,782
Mama would be so upset.

626
01:04:06,979 --> 01:04:09,823
So you'd better stay
a few more days.

627
01:04:10,015 --> 01:04:13,895
I'll go to Rome to make
arrangements with Dr Magli.

628
01:04:14,453 --> 01:04:17,229
I'll have to give him
some details.

629
01:04:17,523 --> 01:04:19,332
How many months are you?

630
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:22,897
I finished my second one
a few days ago.

631
01:04:23,095 --> 01:04:25,974
I don't think there's any
danger at this stage...

632
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:28,236
if one takes
the necessary precautions.

633
01:04:31,136 --> 01:04:32,979
I don't understand.

634
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:37,246
You're not thinking of
keeping it, are you?

635
01:04:37,643 --> 01:04:40,647
Last time you lost it
through natural causes

636
01:04:40,847 --> 01:04:43,555
and that will help cover up
for this one.

637
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,529
I'm referring to the family
who know you're pregnant.

638
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,530
I know what to say
to Dr Magli.

639
01:04:50,723 --> 01:04:52,566
But I can't.

640
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,370
- What can't you?
- I can't.

641
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:04,410
Why not? Are you afraid
or don't you want to?

642
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:09,909
I can't because it's a crime.

643
01:05:23,523 --> 01:05:25,525
A crime.

644
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:29,370
How could you think I'd...

645
01:05:30,396 --> 01:05:33,343
But you're quite happy
to give my name

646
01:05:33,733 --> 01:05:36,805
and my family's affection
to a stranger.

647
01:05:37,002 --> 01:05:39,073
Isn't that a crime?

648
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:46,188
Why won't you answer me?

649
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:52,393
I said I want to help you.

650
01:05:55,354 --> 01:05:59,700
I love you and bear no grudge
for what you've done.

651
01:06:00,492 --> 01:06:03,302
I'm very grateful to you,
but...

652
01:06:03,696 --> 01:06:05,573
But what?

653
01:06:12,805 --> 01:06:15,149
You said it's all over.

654
01:06:16,342 --> 01:06:19,380
That you want to
put it behind you.

655
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:22,752
So it's not true.

656
01:06:22,948 --> 01:06:26,191
Because if it were so,
how could you and I...

657
01:06:26,552 --> 01:06:28,327
Yes, I admit it's impossible.

658
01:06:28,554 --> 01:06:31,694
I must leave you.
It's over between us.

659
01:06:32,391 --> 01:06:34,268
Listen, Giuliana,

660
01:06:34,727 --> 01:06:37,401
the real crime is the one
you want to commit.

661
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:42,245
First you torment yourself
with remorse

662
01:06:42,768 --> 01:06:45,339
but then you absolve
yourself from that sin

663
01:06:45,938 --> 01:06:48,214
and torment yourself
about the consequences

664
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:52,287
and this time the absolution
is a life sentence...

665
01:06:52,612 --> 01:06:54,421
not only for you.

666
01:06:54,614 --> 01:06:57,254
Can't you see how absurd
your behavior is?

667
01:07:00,085 --> 01:07:01,860
I'm an atheist.

668
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:05,369
But that doesn't mean
I don't have moral problems.

669
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:09,235
On the contrary, I'm aware
of their consequences.

670
01:07:09,462 --> 01:07:13,035
I don't delegate God to
decide what's right or wrong.

671
01:07:13,232 --> 01:07:16,179
I assume
my responsibilities.

672
01:07:18,004 --> 01:07:20,985
You see, I know that
my sins,

673
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,913
if I've committed any,

674
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:25,783
can't be redeemed
through repentance

675
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:28,387
or by punishing myself.

676
01:07:28,982 --> 01:07:30,962
I'm a free man.

677
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:34,962
Earth is my only country.
I have no other destination.

678
01:07:35,154 --> 01:07:37,794
My story begins
and ends here.

679
01:07:38,124 --> 01:07:40,434
I don't have a hell to fear

680
01:07:40,626 --> 01:07:42,697
or a heaven to hope for.

681
01:07:42,895 --> 01:07:46,138
I believe we can only
count on ourselves.

682
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:49,613
What I'm proposing
isn't an easy way out.

683
01:07:49,802 --> 01:07:54,547
My solution faces
the truth of existence.

684
01:08:06,152 --> 01:08:09,031
It doesn't seek refuge
in faith

685
01:08:09,222 --> 01:08:12,101
or in a god created
by our imagination

686
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:16,137
who, in another life,
grants rewards or penances.

687
01:08:21,467 --> 01:08:23,708
If I could think like you,

688
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:29,314
have your self-assurance...

689
01:08:31,145 --> 01:08:35,594
You could live your life
freely, to the full,

690
01:08:37,218 --> 01:08:39,289
without fear.

691
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:42,926
Think it over carefully.

692
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,462
It's entirely up to you.

693
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:07,189
Anyway I'll go to Rome
to make the arrangements.

694
01:09:11,386 --> 01:09:13,798
You'll join me as soon
as possible.

695
01:09:14,788 --> 01:09:16,768
I need a favour.

696
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:23,403
That I meet your friend,
Filippo d'Arborio.

697
01:09:23,797 --> 01:09:26,539
Do I have to come to Rome
for that?

698
01:09:27,435 --> 01:09:29,312
Send him an invitation.

699
01:09:29,505 --> 01:09:31,781
He'll be delighted to come.
We're good friends.

700
01:09:32,007 --> 01:09:34,681
Besides, he'll rush here
to see Giuliana again.

701
01:09:35,077 --> 01:09:38,684
He was smitten by her
when I introduced them.

702
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:40,822
I teased him so much.

703
01:09:42,884 --> 01:09:45,364
I don't want to invite him.

704
01:09:45,554 --> 01:09:47,727
It must be a chance meeting.

705
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:51,426
You invite him
and I'll just tum up.

706
01:09:53,495 --> 01:09:56,237
It's a delicate matter.
I can't explain.

707
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:07,781
It's also my fault.

708
01:10:08,175 --> 01:10:11,418
We didn't expect you
in this heat.

709
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:14,819
And since the house
needed a thorough cleaning,

710
01:10:15,016 --> 01:10:17,326
and the carpets
were stained.

711
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,627
I thought...

712
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:30,305
Put the house in order.

713
01:10:30,865 --> 01:10:33,641
My wife will be arriving
next week.

714
01:10:35,937 --> 01:10:39,316
- Who's in the house?
- The cook, Virginia,

715
01:10:39,706 --> 01:10:41,049
and Alfredo.

716
01:10:47,549 --> 01:10:50,223
Any further orders, sir?

717
01:10:54,156 --> 01:10:55,965
What is it?

718
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:00,004
Yes, I need someone
to deliver a letter.

719
01:11:00,428 --> 01:11:01,907
I'll send for the coachman

720
01:11:02,195 --> 01:11:04,937
or I can go myself,
if you like.

721
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,548
You may leave.
I'll call when I'm ready.

722
01:11:42,836 --> 01:11:44,076
Well?

723
01:11:44,538 --> 01:11:47,917
I'd have joined you,
as I said in my letter.

724
01:11:48,374 --> 01:11:51,287
I never thought for one
moment you'd return.

725
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,751
You're contradicting yourself.

726
01:11:53,947 --> 01:11:55,722
You knew I would.

727
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:58,726
Today you send you butler
to my home, not to Paris.

728
01:11:58,919 --> 01:12:01,661
I hadn't heard from you,
so before leaving...

729
01:12:02,257 --> 01:12:06,103
Did you expect me to believe
you'd join me in Paris?

730
01:12:08,731 --> 01:12:11,541
You see? I did well
to come here.

731
01:12:12,866 --> 01:12:14,812
Contrary to common belief.

732
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:18,449
I believe truth is never
said to one's face.

733
01:12:18,838 --> 01:12:20,784
There are too many factors

734
01:12:21,176 --> 01:12:23,918
which intervene in
our intimacy, so...

735
01:12:24,112 --> 01:12:27,889
one usually ends up
not understanding anything.

736
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:31,326
Understanding what?

737
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,132
That you've got over it,
my dear.

738
01:12:36,957 --> 01:12:39,130
Quickly, in fact.

739
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:42,804
Very quickly.

740
01:12:47,168 --> 01:12:49,444
It's not pleasant
for a woman...

741
01:12:50,138 --> 01:12:52,140
to be abandoned.

742
01:12:52,841 --> 01:12:55,720
There are those
ready to pity her

743
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,112
and I don't like that.

744
01:12:58,512 --> 01:13:01,425
There are those who
question her charm

745
01:13:01,615 --> 01:13:03,788
and I don't like that either.

746
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:07,189
You send me a note
when I'm on the train

747
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:10,231
saying that serious
family matters...

748
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:13,728
Oh, come now,

749
01:13:13,927 --> 01:13:17,306
not even a mere clerk
would resort to that.

750
01:13:19,899 --> 01:13:23,369
I really believed
a catastrophe had occurred.

751
01:13:24,172 --> 01:13:28,120
I wanted to go to Paris.
Yes, to have fun.

752
01:13:29,711 --> 01:13:32,692
And when I got there
I didn't even unpack.

753
01:13:32,882 --> 01:13:34,623
I came straight back,

754
01:13:34,816 --> 01:13:37,626
thinking that, if you had
such serious problems,

755
01:13:37,886 --> 01:13:40,264
you might want me
by you side.

756
01:13:40,453 --> 01:13:42,933
My friends will surely laugh

757
01:13:43,923 --> 01:13:48,497
when I tell them the story
of my fall.

758
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,874
What do you say?
Shall we still dine together?

759
01:13:57,071 --> 01:13:59,915
As you wish.
No standing on ceremony.

760
01:14:00,641 --> 01:14:03,554
Please, Teresa,
you're the only person

761
01:14:03,745 --> 01:14:06,385
to whom I may tell my story
one day,

762
01:14:10,752 --> 01:14:13,995
I hope this will be
our last day.

763
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,933
Good evening. Excuse me.

764
01:14:54,528 --> 01:14:57,532
My brother Federico.
Countess Raffo.

765
01:14:59,734 --> 01:15:01,771
Osvaldo said you were here.

766
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:03,944
I'm terribly upset about...

767
01:15:04,406 --> 01:15:06,306
I mean, rather...

768
01:15:06,307 --> 01:15:09,379
I looked into that matter
but couldn't find my friend.

769
01:15:09,978 --> 01:15:12,356
I last saw him before
going to camp.

770
01:15:12,546 --> 01:15:15,288
I didn't even know
he'd gone to Africa.

771
01:15:15,484 --> 01:15:17,293
Why go to Africa, anyway?

772
01:15:18,151 --> 01:15:21,360
Right now he's in hospital
in the isolation ward.

773
01:15:21,756 --> 01:15:25,294
His condition is very serious.
A disease he caught there.

774
01:15:27,862 --> 01:15:30,741
Perhaps, Countess, you know
this friend of mine, too.

775
01:15:31,098 --> 01:15:33,738
- D'Arborio, the writer.
- I've met him.

776
01:15:33,969 --> 01:15:35,710
I'm an admirer of his.

777
01:15:37,537 --> 01:15:39,949
He's between
life and death.

778
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:43,288
The truth is they know
nothing about tropical diseases,

779
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:47,080
and they don't know
how to treat him.

780
01:15:47,849 --> 01:15:49,726
Too much sad news tonight.

781
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:52,826
I'm sorry I'm the bearer
of some of it.

782
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,827
I'm truly sorry.

783
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:56,829
Drop in when you get home.

784
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:59,101
I'm staying out late.

785
01:15:59,494 --> 01:16:02,202
- Never mind, I'll wait.
- Very well.

786
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:13,081
You know what?

787
01:16:13,374 --> 01:16:15,786
I'm suffering less
than I thought.

788
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:19,952
One day I might listen
to what you have to say.

789
01:16:25,921 --> 01:16:27,594
What's wrong?

790
01:16:33,226 --> 01:16:35,035
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

791
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,376
- Nothing.
- The door was open.

792
01:16:37,566 --> 01:16:40,376
You told me to come
at any hour.

793
01:16:41,469 --> 01:16:43,380
Yes, I wanted...

794
01:16:43,573 --> 01:16:46,679
I wanted to know which
hospital d'Arborio is in.

795
01:16:47,008 --> 01:16:50,785
The Policlinic, in isolation.
No one is allowed near him.

796
01:16:51,345 --> 01:16:54,292
Now you must tell me
what you want from him.

797
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:56,393
When you asked to meet him,

798
01:16:56,684 --> 01:16:59,290
I thought you suspected
something between him

799
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:01,121
and Teresa Raffo.

800
01:17:01,591 --> 01:17:04,299
It's plausible, since
all the ladies in Rome

801
01:17:04,657 --> 01:17:06,193
are in love with him.

802
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:10,699
Besides, your lovely Teresa,
no of fence meant, of course,

803
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:14,379
isn't the type to
deny herself a whim.

804
01:17:14,902 --> 01:17:18,714
But no, I found out
they barely know each other.

805
01:17:19,108 --> 01:17:22,681
You saw it yourself.
She didn't know he was ill.

806
01:17:22,978 --> 01:17:25,185
So, what's all the mystery?

807
01:17:26,714 --> 01:17:28,125
I can't tell you anything.

808
01:17:30,918 --> 01:17:34,491
It's a matter which concerns...
a friend.

809
01:17:35,124 --> 01:17:39,072
Well, I'm going to bed.
It's dawn.

810
01:17:39,128 --> 01:17:41,540
Can you at least tell me

811
01:17:42,497 --> 01:17:45,000
when d'Arborio
left for Africa?

812
01:17:45,134 --> 01:17:46,909
I'll find out,

813
01:17:47,102 --> 01:17:49,912
but tell your friend
to leave him in peace.

814
01:17:50,139 --> 01:17:52,278
D'Arborio is ill.
Very ill.

815
01:17:52,306 --> 01:17:55,219
He's a man
who warrants respect.

816
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:58,148
He's not only a great writer
but also an angel.

817
01:17:58,547 --> 01:18:01,926
He's the only person
who makes me feel ashamed...

818
01:18:02,517 --> 01:18:04,019
or almost.

819
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:06,163
Why?

820
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:09,365
If you think about it,
you might realize why.

821
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,895
We're so intelligent,
we're educated.

822
01:18:13,293 --> 01:18:16,172
We've travelled,
we enjoy ourselves so much,

823
01:18:16,565 --> 01:18:19,171
we're so rich...
and then?

824
01:18:20,935 --> 01:18:24,246
- What's all this nonsense?
- I don't know. Good night.

825
01:18:24,673 --> 01:18:27,882
When are we going to the Club?
You owe me a return match.

826
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:32,413
I don't know.

827
01:18:33,148 --> 01:18:35,253
I don't know
what will happen tomorrow.

828
01:18:35,651 --> 01:18:37,961
- It depends.
- Good night.

829
01:19:12,819 --> 01:19:14,298
Good morning.

830
01:19:14,489 --> 01:19:18,198
Madam send me
for her lighter clothes.

831
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:21,370
It's hot at the Badiola
now too.

832
01:19:21,663 --> 01:19:23,973
Didn't she say she was
coming to Rome?

833
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:25,611
No, sir.

834
01:19:27,367 --> 01:19:29,779
I'm sorry, I almost forgot.

835
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,077
<i>W s from Madam.</i>

836
01:19:50,356 --> 01:19:54,327
I also have to do a few
things for your mother.

837
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:58,040
I hope I'll be able
to leave tonight.

838
01:19:58,432 --> 01:20:00,139
If you have any orders...

839
01:20:00,669 --> 01:20:02,706
No, I'll get there before you.

840
01:20:04,004 --> 01:20:06,041
I can't do what you asked.

841
01:20:06,241 --> 01:20:08,949
I'd rather leave.
Get out of your life.

842
01:20:09,543 --> 01:20:11,921
I can't commit murder.

843
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:15,418
- I spoke to...
- Whom?

844
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,493
My confessor.

845
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:26,161
- Did he tell you to leave?
- No, but he agrees.

846
01:20:28,163 --> 01:20:31,201
I hope my family will
give the child their name.

847
01:20:34,737 --> 01:20:38,617
- Why not his father?
- No, he must never know.

848
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,649
Do you really mean that?

849
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:49,517
Do you realize what will
happen if you leave me?

850
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:53,422
It's not the scandal
I'm worried about.

851
01:20:54,622 --> 01:20:57,501
But your situation
as a single mother

852
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:01,333
who, to save her child
deprives it of a father.

853
01:21:03,131 --> 01:21:06,237
If I were convinced
your decision

854
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,347
stemmed only from your moral
and religious convictions,

855
01:21:09,537 --> 01:21:12,177
if I felt you were mine
and mine alone,

856
01:21:14,474 --> 01:21:16,647
I could stand anything.

857
01:21:21,982 --> 01:21:25,088
Children belong to whoever
educates and raises them.

858
01:21:49,644 --> 01:21:52,716
FILIPPO D'ARBORIO IS DEAD

859
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:56,183
Maria, did my wife call?

860
01:21:57,319 --> 01:22:00,892
No, sir, but she asked me
to wake her at 9 o'clock.

861
01:22:01,289 --> 01:22:02,825
Wait a moment.

862
01:22:05,959 --> 01:22:07,996
You may go.

863
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:15,343
May I? Good morning, Madam.
It's 9 o'clock.

864
01:22:15,804 --> 01:22:16,976
Come in.

865
01:23:16,197 --> 01:23:18,438
Have you seen it?

866
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:27,516
I heard he was
seriously ill.

867
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:34,116
I told you, didn't I?

868
01:23:38,487 --> 01:23:40,558
That's strange.

869
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:44,835
I could have sworn
I told you.

870
01:23:48,964 --> 01:23:51,843
A tropical disease
he contracted in Africa.

871
01:24:11,854 --> 01:24:13,765
Why won't you look at me?

872
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:18,699
Who are you thinking about?

873
01:24:22,864 --> 01:24:24,901
Why torture yourself?

874
01:24:53,727 --> 01:24:55,365
The doctor.

875
01:25:00,768 --> 01:25:02,770
I'll show him in.

876
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:10,379
- Hello. Is the midwife here?
- Yes.

877
01:25:17,684 --> 01:25:19,254
This way, doctor.

878
01:25:21,322 --> 01:25:24,030
- Is the doctor here?
- I'm here.

879
01:25:24,123 --> 01:25:26,160
- Come quickly.
- Excuse me, doctor.

880
01:25:26,528 --> 01:25:28,804
I have something to tell you.

881
01:25:29,498 --> 01:25:31,705
And I'll do so
in my mother's presence.

882
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,710
Last time you examined
my wife,

883
01:25:36,037 --> 01:25:38,608
you said we may
be faced with a choice.

884
01:25:39,007 --> 01:25:42,386
Let it be clear, and I
take full responsibility,

885
01:25:42,578 --> 01:25:45,457
that, should this unfortunate
situation arise,

886
01:25:45,645 --> 01:25:47,556
we want the mother saved.

887
01:25:47,748 --> 01:25:51,753
I sincerely hope we won't
be faced with this choice.

888
01:25:51,953 --> 01:25:55,901
But I'm grateful to you for
taking full responsibility.

889
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:58,031
As you know, Catholicism...

890
01:25:58,225 --> 01:26:01,434
I know. It's an immoral
and criminal precept.

891
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:03,672
It doesn't concern me.

892
01:26:04,466 --> 01:26:06,377
Let's go, doctor.

893
01:27:09,164 --> 01:27:11,337
Mr Tullio.

894
01:27:19,141 --> 01:27:20,984
Here's the young master.

895
01:27:21,177 --> 01:27:23,384
He's already opened his eyes.

896
01:27:24,045 --> 01:27:26,855
They're both safe and sound.
We made it.

897
01:27:27,214 --> 01:27:29,922
Congratulations,
he's a beautiful baby.

898
01:27:30,317 --> 01:27:33,321
- Everything went well, sir.
- You may go in now.

899
01:27:33,521 --> 01:27:37,298
But no one else. She's going
through a brief crisis.

900
01:27:37,693 --> 01:27:40,196
- She's well but very weak.
- It's nothing, sir.

901
01:27:40,595 --> 01:27:42,233
Don't worry about it.

902
01:27:42,631 --> 01:27:46,340
Yes, she's had a strange
psychological reaction.

903
01:27:46,534 --> 01:27:49,777
She won't see the child.
She's crying.

904
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:30,253
Isn't he beautiful?
God bless him.

905
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,290
Raimondo.

906
01:28:34,482 --> 01:28:36,723
Grandma's Raimondo.

907
01:28:53,168 --> 01:28:55,808
Isn't he the world's
most beautiful baby?

908
01:28:56,205 --> 01:28:57,980
Look at his eyes.

909
01:28:58,305 --> 01:29:00,182
Don't cry in front of Uncle,
my treasure.

910
01:29:00,575 --> 01:29:02,919
He's so good.
He just eats and sleeps.

911
01:29:03,111 --> 01:29:05,955
Look at his hands.
He'll be tall.

912
01:29:06,147 --> 01:29:08,787
- Isn't he gorgeous?
- Like all babies.

913
01:29:08,983 --> 01:29:12,192
Foals are different.
You should see Zara's.

914
01:29:12,587 --> 01:29:15,329
He's a splendid silvery gray.
But babies...

915
01:29:15,523 --> 01:29:18,970
You're just baiting me.
What do you know about babies?

916
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,970
You were red and wrinkled
when you were born.

917
01:29:22,164 --> 01:29:24,906
You weren't like him.
He's beautiful.

918
01:29:25,499 --> 01:29:27,410
Instead of being silly,

919
01:29:27,602 --> 01:29:30,879
tell Tullio his son
is a little ray of sunshine.

920
01:29:31,072 --> 01:29:33,279
- Must I be the one?
- Yes.

921
01:29:33,474 --> 01:29:37,854
Nurse, shut the windows.
It's cold today.

922
01:29:40,346 --> 01:29:43,327
Are you scared I'll say
the foal is better?

923
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:46,193
Come now, Mama.

924
01:29:46,587 --> 01:29:48,760
I'll tell them I've never
seen such beauty

925
01:29:49,157 --> 01:29:51,899
and that I'll be proud
to be his godfather.

926
01:29:52,126 --> 01:29:53,969
What's wrong?

927
01:29:54,162 --> 01:29:57,200
You joke about it,
but I'm desperate.

928
01:29:57,998 --> 01:29:58,942
Desperate.

929
01:29:59,335 --> 01:30:02,612
- What are you saying?
- You've no idea!

930
01:30:03,403 --> 01:30:05,610
I'm not upset with Giuliana.

931
01:30:06,006 --> 01:30:10,250
Even the doctor said
it's a reaction to stress.

932
01:30:11,045 --> 01:30:12,854
But your brother...

933
01:30:13,447 --> 01:30:15,222
He's so strange.

934
01:30:16,016 --> 01:30:20,021
Before he was worried for her,
and that's understandable,

935
01:30:20,222 --> 01:30:22,224
but now that
all's gone well...

936
01:30:23,024 --> 01:30:25,300
They never see the child.

937
01:30:26,127 --> 01:30:28,107
As if he didn't exist.

938
01:30:28,495 --> 01:30:30,600
They don't even mention him.

939
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:36,380
The only thing your brother
said to me is

940
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:40,780
if we want a baptism,
it must be private.

941
01:30:41,007 --> 01:30:43,647
No reception. Nothing.

942
01:30:44,044 --> 01:30:46,718
You had me scared
for a moment. Is that all?

943
01:30:47,081 --> 01:30:49,027
Tullio isn't religious.

944
01:30:49,415 --> 01:30:50,985
He has his own ideas.

945
01:30:51,386 --> 01:30:53,764
We'll celebrate
some other time.

946
01:30:54,155 --> 01:30:56,931
- Is that what upsets you?
- Yes, very much.

947
01:30:57,525 --> 01:30:59,266
With everything else.

948
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:04,040
They keep to their room.
They're hostile.

949
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:06,341
But this is all good news.

950
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:09,174
We won't have
the bother of the party,

951
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:12,551
and Tullio and Giuliana
are so in love

952
01:31:12,939 --> 01:31:14,475
they forget they have a son.

953
01:31:14,877 --> 01:31:16,754
Perk up, all will go well

954
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:21,217
and Tullio will go to church
as he did for his wedding.

955
01:31:23,516 --> 01:31:26,395
And Raimondo?
Are they calling him that?

956
01:32:09,864 --> 01:32:13,334
You're crazy husband is
driving mother to distraction.

957
01:32:14,335 --> 01:32:18,283
It would have been better if
you'd not come to the church.

958
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:21,245
I told Mama and the nurse
to have champagne with us

959
01:32:21,642 --> 01:32:23,246
to calm her down.

960
01:32:24,178 --> 01:32:26,920
It's champagne,
not holy water!

961
01:32:27,715 --> 01:32:29,388
Come in.

962
01:32:32,854 --> 01:32:34,959
Good! Come in.

963
01:32:37,124 --> 01:32:39,126
Not here. In the other room.

964
01:32:41,429 --> 01:32:43,909
Giuliana mustn't get tired.
You may go.

965
01:32:47,235 --> 01:32:49,146
Let's go, Federico.

966
01:32:49,737 --> 01:32:52,377
Do you really
not want us here?

967
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,581
Why don't you come?

968
01:32:54,776 --> 01:32:57,416
The doctor said you can
move a bit.

969
01:32:57,611 --> 01:33:00,615
It would do you good.
Come on, make an effort.

970
01:33:01,016 --> 01:33:02,962
- Hurry up.
- For me.

971
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:05,223
I'll see you later.

972
01:33:16,999 --> 01:33:19,741
Let's have a nice Christmas
to please Mama too.

973
01:33:20,133 --> 01:33:22,238
Try to come up with something.

974
01:33:23,005 --> 01:33:25,849
Don't count on me.
I'm leaving.

975
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:29,813
You're not staying for
Christmas? Mama said...

976
01:33:30,244 --> 01:33:32,815
I'm sorry to disappoint her
but I've changed my mind.

977
01:33:33,414 --> 01:33:35,223
I just can't do it.

978
01:33:37,117 --> 01:33:40,121
I'm sorry but I don't like
the atmosphere here.

979
01:33:41,255 --> 01:33:44,828
I love you all, but I
have my problems, too.

980
01:33:45,226 --> 01:33:47,866
And I want to spend
my leave in peace.

981
01:33:49,162 --> 01:33:51,904
I'll go and find some joy
elsewhere.

982
01:33:56,837 --> 01:33:59,044
Has he eaten?

983
01:34:01,009 --> 01:34:03,148
I hoped he'd be awake.

984
01:34:06,213 --> 01:34:08,159
Will he be warm enough?

985
01:34:08,349 --> 01:34:10,260
His little hands feel cold.

986
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:14,257
- Shall we put his mittens on?
- No, Madam, don't worry.

987
01:34:14,654 --> 01:34:16,224
He's nice and warm.

988
01:34:18,093 --> 01:34:20,664
Don't worry, he won't wake up.

989
01:34:21,063 --> 01:34:23,600
Besides, babies like
hearing voices,

990
01:34:23,999 --> 01:34:25,808
hearing they're not alone.

991
01:34:29,871 --> 01:34:32,283
You go to bed too, Nurse.
Good night.

992
01:34:32,672 --> 01:34:34,117
Good night, Madam.

993
01:34:52,528 --> 01:34:55,702
I've been watching you
coddle him at night.

994
01:34:56,097 --> 01:34:59,340
Why don't you tell the world
how much you love him?

995
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:02,680
Don't lie. Have the courage
to speak the truth.

996
01:35:07,442 --> 01:35:10,355
I went in because
I thought someone called.

997
01:35:10,545 --> 01:35:13,617
It's happened before.
As if something was wrong.

998
01:35:14,015 --> 01:35:15,653
That's not true.

999
01:35:16,051 --> 01:35:18,588
I've seen you sneak out
in the dark before.

1000
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:22,230
What's wrong with that?
You do the same thing.

1001
01:35:22,689 --> 01:35:24,362
Nurse told me.

1002
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:32,471
It's true.

1003
01:35:33,267 --> 01:35:35,406
But it's not the same thing.

1004
01:35:35,604 --> 01:35:38,244
By watching him, I try to discover your secret.

1005
01:35:38,705 --> 01:35:41,311
I try to force myself
to forget,

1006
01:35:41,509 --> 01:35:43,682
but I can't... I can't.

1007
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:46,855
And I damn the day
I accepted this torture.

1008
01:35:47,048 --> 01:35:49,722
And you've changed.
You're happy now.

1009
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,895
That's why I can't stop
looking at him.

1010
01:35:54,455 --> 01:35:57,334
And you don't care
that I'm suffering.

1011
01:35:57,925 --> 01:35:59,734
You love him.

1012
01:36:00,061 --> 01:36:03,008
And by loving him,
you're loving him father.

1013
01:36:06,635 --> 01:36:08,478
You know that's not true.

1014
01:36:10,138 --> 01:36:12,982
I even wanted him to die
when he was born.

1015
01:36:14,576 --> 01:36:16,681
It's awful, but it's true.

1016
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,392
His presence
distresses me, too.

1017
01:36:23,249 --> 01:36:27,356
Yes, I hate him for
the pain he's causing you.

1018
01:36:29,857 --> 01:36:32,736
I can't see you like this.
Why won't you believe me?

1019
01:36:33,228 --> 01:36:34,901
I swear I hate him.

1020
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,638
Is that how you feel?

1021
01:36:57,252 --> 01:36:58,356
Yes.

1022
01:36:58,552 --> 01:37:00,589
Because he's come
between us.

1023
01:37:00,988 --> 01:37:02,695
I would like you and I to...

1024
01:37:19,339 --> 01:37:22,548
Take me away. We'll be
happy far from here.

1025
01:37:25,012 --> 01:37:28,323
We'll leave after Christmas.
I promise.

1026
01:37:36,292 --> 01:37:38,898
Mama's waiting downstairs.
We're going to Mass.

1027
01:37:42,163 --> 01:37:43,938
Your cape, Madam.

1028
01:37:43,998 --> 01:37:45,739
No, you may go.

1029
01:37:47,101 --> 01:37:49,308
Won't you wear my present?

1030
01:37:50,272 --> 01:37:52,183
I think hot.
It's so extravagant.

1031
01:37:52,573 --> 01:37:53,950
Nonsense.

1032
01:37:54,142 --> 01:37:56,850
The peasants always like
to see their masters...

1033
01:37:57,245 --> 01:37:59,191
well-dressed.

1034
01:38:01,048 --> 01:38:04,586
The bell has rung twice.
We must hurry.

1035
01:38:05,186 --> 01:38:07,063
Very well.

1036
01:39:40,981 --> 01:39:43,757
You may go to Mass, Nurse.
I'll stay here.

1037
01:39:44,151 --> 01:39:47,792
Thank you, sir.
The baby is asleep anyway.

1038
01:40:06,274 --> 01:40:09,221
Good night, Mr Tullio
and Merry Christmas.

1039
01:40:10,211 --> 01:40:11,918
Good night.

1040
01:44:21,395 --> 01:44:25,309
- Have dinner sewed.
- Yes, Madam, right away.

1041
01:44:39,379 --> 01:44:42,553
Yet another Christmas
has gone by.

1042
01:44:47,887 --> 01:44:49,798
And we'll be leaving.

1043
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:52,605
You promised...

1044
01:44:53,061 --> 01:44:55,871
After Christmas.
When are we leaving?

1045
01:44:57,498 --> 01:44:59,444
Whenever you like.

1046
01:44:59,967 --> 01:45:01,844
Tomorrow, if you like.

1047
01:45:09,776 --> 01:45:11,778
The baby isn't breathing!

1048
01:45:12,379 --> 01:45:14,222
Doctor, hurry!

1049
01:45:39,973 --> 01:45:42,453
He's not breathing.

1050
01:45:44,344 --> 01:45:47,223
He's stopped breathing, doctor.

1051
01:45:56,558 --> 01:45:58,435
Don't go in there.

1052
01:45:59,826 --> 01:46:01,396
Why not?

1053
01:46:02,396 --> 01:46:04,603
Stay with me. I'm afraid.

1054
01:46:06,167 --> 01:46:08,078
I'm so afraid.

1055
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:12,912
Come with me.

1056
01:46:13,309 --> 01:46:14,379
Come.

1057
01:46:21,915 --> 01:46:24,259
Mr Hermil.

1058
01:46:48,577 --> 01:46:51,023
No, it can't be.

1059
01:46:51,213 --> 01:46:53,420
It can't be.

1060
01:47:09,963 --> 01:47:11,567
Dead?

1061
01:47:14,434 --> 01:47:15,742
Yes.

1062
01:47:18,373 --> 01:47:20,751
Get away. Don't touch me.

1063
01:47:22,042 --> 01:47:24,079
I'm not your accomplice.

1064
01:47:24,511 --> 01:47:27,856
Be quiet, Giuliana.
I beg you.

1065
01:47:28,048 --> 01:47:30,858
- You did it.
- Quiet. You knew all along.

1066
01:47:31,253 --> 01:47:33,995
It's your fault.
I hate you.

1067
01:47:34,656 --> 01:47:37,364
No, you've always said
you hated him.

1068
01:47:37,558 --> 01:47:41,199
No, I wanted to save him
from you.

1069
01:47:41,596 --> 01:47:44,338
- I did my utmost to save him.
- What are you saying?

1070
01:47:44,732 --> 01:47:47,269
Yes, everything I did
with you was to save him.

1071
01:47:47,668 --> 01:47:49,341
Only to save him.

1072
01:47:49,537 --> 01:47:52,245
And now, for the rest
of my days,

1073
01:47:52,807 --> 01:47:56,380
I will have to live with
this mark on my soul.

1074
01:47:57,379 --> 01:47:59,381
Help me, God.

1075
01:47:59,579 --> 01:48:02,116
May you be
as unhappy as I am.

1076
01:48:03,449 --> 01:48:05,224
You're lying to yourself.

1077
01:48:05,619 --> 01:48:07,530
You wanted him to die.

1078
01:48:07,924 --> 01:48:09,801
Not for one moment

1079
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:12,231
did I want to get rid
of him.

1080
01:48:12,795 --> 01:48:15,776
Because I loved him,
my poor baby...

1081
01:48:16,865 --> 01:48:19,345
denied a thousand times.

1082
01:48:19,533 --> 01:48:21,274
You must know that

1083
01:48:21,803 --> 01:48:24,283
so you'll understand
that it's truly over.

1084
01:48:24,471 --> 01:48:27,452
I loved and always will
love that baby's father.

1085
01:48:27,842 --> 01:48:30,948
To the end of my days,
I can but hate you.

1086
01:48:31,947 --> 01:48:33,824
Hate you.

1087
01:48:34,014 --> 01:48:35,994
Despise you.

1088
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:40,329
Women have the
extraordinary capacity

1089
01:48:40,587 --> 01:48:42,260
to adapt reality

1090
01:48:42,556 --> 01:48:45,196
to the romantic ideals
of the worst literature.

1091
01:48:46,462 --> 01:48:49,341
My wife's affair
with Filippo d'Arborio,

1092
01:48:50,466 --> 01:48:52,878
lasted but a fleeting moment.

1093
01:48:53,268 --> 01:48:55,839
Just like many
of your friends

1094
01:48:56,137 --> 01:48:59,880
who fell for the
fashionable scribe,

1095
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:02,780
who had the misfortune
to contract a disease

1096
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:05,283
which sent him back
to his maker.

1097
01:49:06,482 --> 01:49:07,688
That's all.

1098
01:49:07,983 --> 01:49:11,795
I'm only sorry
that I helped to contribute

1099
01:49:12,085 --> 01:49:14,929
to this appalling
second rate novel.

1100
01:49:15,356 --> 01:49:17,233
You don't really believe

1101
01:49:17,658 --> 01:49:20,605
you caused the death
of that innocent?

1102
01:49:22,095 --> 01:49:23,768
You see, it's strange,

1103
01:49:24,231 --> 01:49:27,212
but newborn babies have
an extraordinary resistance.

1104
01:49:27,634 --> 01:49:29,272
The cold didn't kill it.

1105
01:49:29,636 --> 01:49:31,809
So don't feel any remorse.

1106
01:49:33,942 --> 01:49:36,183
He must have died because...

1107
01:49:36,643 --> 01:49:38,247
No, that doesn't matter.

1108
01:49:38,578 --> 01:49:43,049
As far as I'm concerned,
it's the intention that counts.

1109
01:49:43,986 --> 01:49:47,593
And there are so no doubts
about my intentions.

1110
01:49:48,991 --> 01:49:52,200
I knew full well
what I was doing.

1111
01:49:52,626 --> 01:49:55,937
I feel no remorse
and I'm not justifying myself.

1112
01:49:56,498 --> 01:49:59,342
I'm not touched
by man's justice because...

1113
01:50:00,335 --> 01:50:03,282
no court on earth
could sit in judgment on me.

1114
01:50:06,542 --> 01:50:08,317
Have I bored you?

1115
01:50:08,544 --> 01:50:09,989
I'm sorry.

1116
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:15,017
It's early. We can still
spend some time together.

1117
01:50:15,249 --> 01:50:17,354
That would give me
great pleasure.

1118
01:50:51,752 --> 01:50:53,595
I like your home.

1119
01:50:57,525 --> 01:51:00,301
I've tried to picture it
so many times...

1120
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,839
but never succeeded.

1121
01:51:20,881 --> 01:51:22,622
It's strange, you know,

1122
01:51:24,852 --> 01:51:26,627
because it resembles you.

1123
01:51:41,902 --> 01:51:43,882
It really does.

1124
01:51:44,405 --> 01:51:47,249
- With all your beauty...
- And my ugliness.

1125
01:51:49,176 --> 01:51:51,383
What is there that's ugly?

1126
01:51:51,846 --> 01:51:53,587
Let's hear it.

1127
01:51:54,849 --> 01:51:57,261
Slow down. There's no rush.

1128
01:51:58,519 --> 01:52:00,362
I have to look carefully...

1129
01:52:03,757 --> 01:52:05,634
and think it over.

1130
01:52:15,604 --> 01:52:18,915
- Will you offer me a drink?
- Of course.

1131
01:52:52,272 --> 01:52:53,273
Well?

1132
01:52:53,873 --> 01:52:55,784
Have you decided?

1133
01:52:56,178 --> 01:52:58,784
What is there in me
that's ugly?

1134
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:01,960
Now I'll tell you.

1135
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:06,166
Let me drink first.

1136
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:18,144
I shouldn't. I drank
so much at dinner.

1137
01:53:19,265 --> 01:53:21,541
But you've plunged me...

1138
01:53:22,536 --> 01:53:24,209
into such melancholy.

1139
01:53:32,147 --> 01:53:34,218
One step at a time.

1140
01:53:36,417 --> 01:53:39,193
You asked me before
what I thought

1141
01:53:39,587 --> 01:53:41,533
about what you told me.

1142
01:53:43,890 --> 01:53:45,892
Now I'll tell you.

1143
01:53:47,861 --> 01:53:51,240
I believe you're even more
in love with your wife.

1144
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,971
So much in love
that you're pitiful.

1145
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:01,214
That's not so, my love.

1146
01:54:02,309 --> 01:54:05,313
I admit that my experiences
with her, of late...

1147
01:54:06,312 --> 01:54:08,189
have been intoxicating.

1148
01:54:08,582 --> 01:54:11,995
But murky and morbid,
if you like.

1149
01:54:12,919 --> 01:54:16,196
Only the pure are capable
of such excess.

1150
01:54:16,991 --> 01:54:20,666
Think of the hair-shirts
worn by ascetics.

1151
01:54:21,061 --> 01:54:22,768
You're in love with her.

1152
01:54:24,498 --> 01:54:27,172
And for the first time
you feel defeated.

1153
01:54:28,603 --> 01:54:31,607
Your two rivals
cannot be vanquished

1154
01:54:32,006 --> 01:54:33,542
because they're dead.

1155
01:54:34,142 --> 01:54:36,179
Poor Tullio.

1156
01:54:38,146 --> 01:54:40,148
What nonsense
are you saying?

1157
01:54:41,415 --> 01:54:44,259
If there's a loser
in this mournful story,

1158
01:54:45,452 --> 01:54:47,193
it's my wife.

1159
01:54:48,922 --> 01:54:51,027
She, who has decided
to live

1160
01:54:51,458 --> 01:54:54,268
among the ghosts
of the graveyards,

1161
01:54:54,461 --> 01:54:57,203
instead of living
her life freely.

1162
01:54:57,431 --> 01:55:00,412
And who obstinately
refuses to believe

1163
01:55:01,803 --> 01:55:05,717
that our problems should
be solved here on earth

1164
01:55:06,107 --> 01:55:08,951
and not in a hypothetical
hereafter.

1165
01:55:11,347 --> 01:55:13,725
Whereas I'm here with myself

1166
01:55:14,414 --> 01:55:17,554
without illusions,
without regrets.

1167
01:55:19,153 --> 01:55:23,533
The day I no longer
had a taste for life...

1168
01:55:24,326 --> 01:55:26,306
felt no curiosity...

1169
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:30,005
I would end it all.

1170
01:55:32,466 --> 01:55:34,742
Those are things one says.

1171
01:55:35,204 --> 01:55:38,981
But there comes a time
when one ceases to live

1172
01:55:40,375 --> 01:55:43,686
and begins merely to exist.

1173
01:55:46,913 --> 01:55:49,553
But we don't realize it

1174
01:55:49,752 --> 01:55:53,427
and if we are unfortunate
enough to do so,

1175
01:55:54,421 --> 01:55:55,764
our hopes tum to
eternal life.

1176
01:55:58,359 --> 01:56:00,839
That's not my case, I swear.

1177
01:56:03,231 --> 01:56:05,211
How do you know?

1178
01:56:06,066 --> 01:56:09,070
You're always so sure
of yourself.

1179
01:56:10,873 --> 01:56:15,117
But no one knows
what the future holds.

1180
01:56:15,911 --> 01:56:17,822
Not even you.

1181
01:56:23,983 --> 01:56:25,860
Less than a year ago

1182
01:56:26,053 --> 01:56:28,727
you spend your nights
beneath my windows

1183
01:56:29,122 --> 01:56:31,159
crazed with desire
and jealousy.

1184
01:56:31,559 --> 01:56:33,095
And I...

1185
01:56:33,896 --> 01:56:37,639
committed all kinds of follies
to smother my love for you.

1186
01:56:40,967 --> 01:56:45,882
I wonder why you men
raise us up with one hand

1187
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:49,382
and drag us down
with the other.

1188
01:56:50,312 --> 01:56:53,816
Why won't you let us
walk by your side...

1189
01:56:54,748 --> 01:56:57,456
as one being
next to another?

1190
01:56:58,018 --> 01:56:59,827
Woman next to man.

1191
01:57:00,154 --> 01:57:02,896
Nothing more, nothing less.

1192
01:57:04,123 --> 01:57:06,194
Of course...

1193
01:57:06,594 --> 01:57:09,097
if I decided to live
by your side.

1194
01:57:12,367 --> 01:57:14,176
Live by my side?

1195
01:57:16,871 --> 01:57:19,715
But I don't love you,
my treasure.

1196
01:57:20,976 --> 01:57:22,956
You're a monster.

1197
01:57:25,346 --> 01:57:28,054
Not because of what
you've told me.

1198
01:57:29,049 --> 01:57:30,790
After all,

1199
01:57:31,185 --> 01:57:34,462
that's just the natural
conclusion to everything.

1200
01:57:36,858 --> 01:57:39,361
You're the most
attractive man

1201
01:57:39,558 --> 01:57:41,834
I've ever held in my arms.

1202
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:43,673
But...

1203
01:57:44,198 --> 01:57:49,147
if I ever decided I was
the sole arbiter of my life,

1204
01:57:49,536 --> 01:57:52,142
I wouldn't want to feel
unworthy of it.

1205
01:58:06,287 --> 01:58:08,392
Leave me alone now.

1206
01:58:19,834 --> 01:58:22,815
What will happen
if I go to sleep here?

1207
01:58:23,404 --> 01:58:25,384
Are you tired?

1208
01:58:29,044 --> 01:58:31,422
Maybe I had too much
to drink.

1209
01:58:32,179 --> 01:58:34,125
Please don't go to sleep.

1210
01:58:38,117 --> 01:58:39,960
I can't help it.

1211
01:58:40,556 --> 01:58:42,900
I'm tired.

1212
01:58:58,205 --> 01:59:00,242
Please don't go to sleep.

1213
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:04,314
I want to show you
my conclusion.
