1
00:00:03,078 --> 00:00:06,078
You'll meet two Chiefs on the Komodo Island.

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,818
Good luck, The Law of Jungle.

3
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:10,758
- Today, - Salute to the Chief.

4
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:13,788
it's the second part of the Komodo Island special.

5
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:16,558
A new Byung Man's Tribe is here to make legends.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,058
Nobody in the jungle was as funny as these two.

7
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:21,528
He's a great entertainer...

8
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:23,068
who makes the Chief laugh.

9
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:25,298
That looks so ugly. Don't ever come again.

10
00:00:25,438 --> 00:00:30,078
Byung Man and Soo Geun's hilarious jungle life starts soon.

11
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:31,978
They're coming.

12
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:34,848
Meanwhile, Byung Man's Tribe divided up into two teams...

13
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:37,478
to patrol the island.

14
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:38,818
Help me, Crab Man.

15
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:42,748
Wan, the Crab Man, was doing very well...

16
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:46,318
and they finally found a huge crab.

17
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:47,688
You can catch it.

18
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:50,458
It's a confrontational situation. What will the result be?

19
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:53,228
- Should I use a net? It's alive. - Go ahead.

20
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:56,268
(It's pretty big.)

21
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,298
- This is it. - What if it bites?

22
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,538
(They observe first before approaching it.)

23
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:03,138
- You can catch it. - Here.

24
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:04,208
(He pokes it.)

25
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,208
It's upset.

26
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,208
(It attacks back.)

27
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:09,008
(He approaches it carefully.)

28
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:12,548
(He prepares for a good aim.)

29
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:14,048
You caught it.

30
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:15,388
You got it.

31
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:17,358
(She's suddenly a fan of Wan.)

32
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:19,988
Let's take it in the net.

33
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:22,058
- But... - I'll hold it.

34
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,828
(Min Gyu tries to help.)

35
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:27,068
Should I do this?

36
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,398
Hold the back legs.

37
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,298
(It's still resisting a lot.)

38
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:32,368
It's so strong.

39
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:33,538
It ripped the net.

40
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:35,538
(It has a deadly weapon.)

41
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:37,608
(This is a matter of his pride as the Crab Man.)

42
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:42,008
(Let go.)

43
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:43,548
(They take a step back.)

44
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:47,748
I've never seen a crab like this. It's so strong.

45
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:50,358
It's holding onto this.

46
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:51,958
(It's holding onto the net.)

47
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:54,658
Let go. Please let go.

48
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:56,258
It won't let go.

49
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:57,258
(It's persistent.)

50
00:01:58,498 --> 00:01:59,528
It won't let go.

51
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:00,928
(They decide to take it as it is.)

52
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:02,828
- Just carry it like that. - It's so strong.

53
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:05,638
(That was a good fight.)

54
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:06,908
I can imagine how full this will be.

55
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:07,968
(It's enough to share.)

56
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:10,008
We can eat this.

57
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,878
- I'm hungry. - Let's go.

58
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:14,648
We can catch more crabs.

59
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:17,148
- Crab Man. - Crab Man.

60
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:18,318
Crab Man.

61
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:19,318
(They get to eat the crab because of him.)

62
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:21,618
(He's the Crab Man.)

63
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:23,018
Press it with your hands.

64
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,018
The Chief is not available to guide them,

65
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:26,758
but the team left on the Komodo Island...

66
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:29,828
worked together to secure food for dinner.

67
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,858
How do I catch this?

68
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:34,528
- Did you get it? - But these shrimps are good.

69
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:37,398
It's not a lot but they can share,

70
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:39,038
so they return home.

71
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:43,638
Meanwhile, the Chief and his team managed to catch a big fish.

72
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:48,248
I'm going to make fire but not burn the wood.

73
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:53,388
- Is this smoke? - Yes.

74
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:54,748
(Byung Man knows how to cook the food appropriately.)

75
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:57,358
- It'll take away all the smell. - I think so too.

76
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:00,858
- Smell the charcoal. - It looks so good.

77
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:01,928
(The smell of the charcoal seeps through the cuts.)

78
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:02,988
It's taking a while.

79
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:05,928
(Jung Sik has a question.)

80
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:09,198
I can't understand how you're so fit.

81
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:12,638
How can you keep going?

82
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,068
(You can make us do things.)

83
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:18,338
I can't say it.

84
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:22,248
I can't order people to do things.

85
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,578
(He'd rather do the work himself than order people around.)

86
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,948
I can't do that.

87
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:28,148
Are you introverted?

88
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,058
I'm very introverted.

89
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:31,718
I overcame it a little bit.

90
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:32,788
(He was naturally an introvert...)

91
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:34,858
(but he overcame it by meeting people on The Law of Jungle.)

92
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:36,258
This show...

93
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:38,428
helped me overcome it.

94
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,368
I was shy during "The Master" too.

95
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:45,638
I was like that when I first started this show.

96
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:50,778
I didn't know how to talk to people.

97
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:52,008
I didn't know what to talk about.

98
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:53,078
(He was shy then unlike now.)

99
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:59,178
(He carried the responsibility as the Chief.)

100
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:04,118
(He did more than speak...)

101
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,058
(and overcame all hardships.)

102
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:11,598
(And...)

103
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:12,758
Good job.

104
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:18,438
(He spoke about what's on his mind and showed tears.)

105
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:21,008
- Good job, Kwang Hee. - Good job, everybody.

106
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:26,138
This show changed my personality a lot.

107
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,278
I...

108
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,978
learned a little bit about how to become a leader.

109
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,988
It changed me a lot.

110
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:42,088
Shouldn't you do something to clear your mind?

111
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:45,528
Don't you have to find a way to release the stress?

112
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:48,068
Skydiving makes me clear my head.

113
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:49,568
Skydiving?

114
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:52,868
You have to focus on it solely...

115
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:54,408
because...

116
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,508
you can't think about anything else.

117
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:01,008
For that day,

118
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,278
I don't need anything else.

119
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:09,418
There's nothing impossible in this world. That's my state of mind.

120
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:10,618
(He gets liberated from all the anxiety.)

121
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,018
Ready, set, go.

122
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:15,328
(When he throws his body into the blue sky,)

123
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:18,528
(he feels completely free.)

124
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:23,838
(It's a time for himself and nobody else.)

125
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,838
"What do I do?" "How do I make it fun?"

126
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:32,008
"What should I do so that this can be a memorable time for them?"

127
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:35,378
My head is filled with thoughts like that.

128
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:36,448
(He's been thinking about these without telling his Tribe members.)

129
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:40,248
I'm getting mentally exhausted.

130
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,388
(Sky)

131
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:46,288
(It's the only escape from his mind.)

132
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:48,858
That was the best.

133
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,258
I loved it.

134
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:52,498
I'm a skydiver!

135
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:54,428
(Byung Man is a skydiver.)

136
00:05:55,728 --> 00:05:58,798
When I get stressed, I want to do it again.

137
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:00,238
(He can't give up on the freedom.)

138
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:03,008
That's why people do extreme sports.

139
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,208
(Skydiving is precious for Byung Man.)

140
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:06,378
It gives me a sense of satisfaction.

141
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:12,548
(We wish Byung Man a speedy recovery.)

142
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:16,218
Let's start cooking.

143
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:17,358
(Hani and the guys start cooking now.)

144
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:20,228
(They're busy.)

145
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:22,558
When is Kang Nam coming back?

146
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:24,158
(Kang Nam is missing.)

147
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:28,028
This is too long...

148
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:30,338
and the strings came out, so I made it short.

149
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:33,408
I'll get some food for breakfast.

150
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:34,468
(He takes the handmade tool.)

151
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:35,538
I'll be quick.

152
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:37,978
We have no food, so I have to find something.

153
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:39,178
I'll be back.

154
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:40,978
I'll be quick.

155
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:42,048
(He goes back to hunt without dinner.)

156
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:43,178
(He's awesome.)

157
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:44,318
He's so cool.

158
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:47,048
(He sets out to the water alone at night.)

159
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:49,648
(He dives in without hesitation.)

160
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:52,558
(He has Byung Man's spirit.)

161
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:55,388
Chief Byung Man wasn't here with us,

162
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:58,058
so I wanted to act like a leader.

163
00:06:58,058 --> 00:06:59,658
I was trying my best.

164
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:00,698
(Kang Nam steps up and takes the responsibility.)

165
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,868
(Did he spot something?)

166
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:08,168
(It's a sleeping turtle.)

167
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,978
(That's too bad.)

168
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:16,208
(What will the Vice-Chief bring back from the sea?)

169
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:20,188
Kang Nam is quite...

170
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:23,158
- family-oriented. - He's awesome.

171
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:25,958
He's quite awesome.

172
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:29,158
I think he has to rename himself as Kang Quite.

173
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:31,298
Kang Quite?

174
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,268
- Yes. That's his nickname. - Quite.

175
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,098
(They start cooking without Kang Nam.)

176
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:40,108
- How do you skewer this? - The net is all ripped.

177
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:41,238
(They're using the landing net as skewers.)

178
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:43,278
Hani worked so hard to make it.

179
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,078
I want to say thank you.

180
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:46,548
Do you want the shrimp?

181
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:47,548
(It's Min Gyu's cooking class.)

182
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:49,708
- Is that how you do it? - Yes.

183
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,848
- Through there? - Right here.

184
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,818
(Throw away your conscience when skewering the shrimp.)

185
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:54,818
(Imagine how good the food will turn out.)

186
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:56,388
You can put them on the skewers.

187
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:00,088
- It's a shrimp skewer. - The shrimp looks really good.

188
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:02,488
(They're excited about how the shrimp will turn out.)

189
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,528
- Kang Nam. - What about the crab.

190
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:05,798
- You're back. - You're back.

191
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,268
- Did you catch anything? - How did it turn out?

192
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:10,168
(Show us...)

193
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:11,768
(your power.)

194
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:13,968
Don't pay attention to me.

195
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:16,438
Don't pay attention to me.

196
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:18,338
Pretend like I'm not here.

197
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,708
Don't pay attention to me.

198
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,348
Act like I was here the whole time.

199
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:24,978
- No, this is... - I've been here the whole time.

200
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:28,618
I did catch one.

201
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:29,858
Let's see.

202
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,158
Don't focus on me.

203
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:32,188
(He doesn't want the attention.)

204
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:34,728
- You caught something. - Kang Nam.

205
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:36,628
It's perfect for breakfast.

206
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:38,628
(However,)

207
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,968
Kang Nam.

208
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:41,468
(he didn't expect such a warm welcome.)

209
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:43,498
It's perfect for breakfast. We have another one.

210
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:44,538
- It's a crab. - Really?

211
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:48,038
(These guys make me want to cry.)

212
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:50,178
How did you catch that?

213
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:55,508
- Good job, Kang Nam. - Thank you.

214
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:56,718
(They only have each other without the Chief.)

215
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:01,988
- Move it to the middle. - We can boil this.

216
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:05,288
- This looks so good. - It looks amazing.

217
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:07,388
It's a shrimp and crab skewer.

218
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:08,728
How many are there?

219
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:11,798
Break it.

220
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,368
- Good job. - How did you do that?

221
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,668
Do it like this.

222
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:17,798
(They're amazed.)

223
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:20,838
- This'll taste good in soy sauce. - It really will.

224
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,138
- It's coming out. - All right.

225
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:23,908
We did the same yesterday.

226
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:25,908
- It has to be beaten. - It shouldn't have any fishy smell.

227
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,608
I got some of this today.

228
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:31,978
Here you go.

229
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:33,048
(They start cooking the mud crab.)

230
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:36,858
- This looks good. - It looks great.

231
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:38,918
Squeeze it hard.

232
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:40,828
(They add Jae Hee's tamarind.)

233
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:42,828
(Exclaiming)

234
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:46,158
(They're done preparing the herbal steamed crab.)

235
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,868
What's that? It's aromatic.

236
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,068
(Jae Hee completed the preparation.)

237
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:52,568
I finally did something to help.

238
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:55,268
Doesn't this look like a set menu?

239
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:56,738
- Yes, it does. - It kind of does.

240
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:58,378
Let's have a set menu.

241
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:00,778
We used the torch.

242
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:01,848
(It gets roasted in the fire.)

243
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,148
This looks fantastic.

244
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,848
Roast it until they dry out.

245
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,088
(Dazed)

246
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:16,058
It's turning red.

247
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:17,258
(As it gets cooked,)

248
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:19,298
(it gets painful for them to keep staring at it.)

249
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:21,498
- I don't think it's cooked yet. - It doesn't look like it.

250
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:25,438
I kept on thinking about bread for some reason...

251
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:27,908
and it's because that looks like a hardtack.

252
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:30,708
Hardtacks taste great when you're in the military.

253
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,348
It tastes really good if you add sugar in the bag and shake it.

254
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:38,018
You're so young, but you've had such variety of food.

255
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:40,048
This won't do.

256
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:43,258
I have to introduce you to the paradise of food.

257
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:44,758
- Are you good at cooking? - He can't be.

258
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:47,028
I always cook at home.

259
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:49,328
You cook for 13 people?

260
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:51,928
Have you ever cooked 20 bags of ramyeon.

261
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,368
- At one time? - Yes.

262
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,698
- Is that possible? That's amazing. - Right?

263
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:59,168
- How do you make 20? - You can't make them soggy.

264
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:00,368
How do they not get soggy?

265
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,808
You do this.

266
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,938
You add the soup base when the water is boiling on high heat.

267
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:07,648
You add the noodles after, and then press them down.

268
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:10,218
- Do you use your hands? - You shorten them.

269
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:11,218
(The noodles have to be short.)

270
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:14,218
- They have to be short. - You have to cook for five minutes.

271
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:15,848
- No, 30 seconds or 1 minute. - 30 seconds?

272
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:19,218
- 30 seconds? - I call the other members...

273
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:21,058
then tell them to line up. They get cooked during that time.

274
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:24,028
I hand the bowls out and some are more cooked than others.

275
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:25,228
They can line up according to their preferences.

276
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:26,668
The 7th or 8th place is when the noodles are perfectly cooked.

277
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:27,768
Really?

278
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:31,398
(They get more hungry after hearing that.)

279
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:32,698
Do you live by yourself, Wan?

280
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:34,308
- I used to, but after... - You live alone?

281
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:36,068
my sister got married,

282
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:39,508
- After she got married? - my mom was on her own.

283
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,108
So it hasn't been that long since you moved back in?

284
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:44,118
I live in the same neighborhood as Rain.

285
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:45,448
Are you close to him?

286
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:47,818
You are, right?

287
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,248
We're a family.

288
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:51,718
- But I'm trying... - He's new to the family.

289
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:53,158
so that I feel like he's truly a part of the family.

290
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:54,728
Do you call him brother or brother-in-law?

291
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,998
- I sometimes do. - Should we open this?

292
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,958
- This looks good. - Wait.

293
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:03,838
You were in the same drama as your sister.

294
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:07,808
- That was my first drama. - The song is called "I Miss You".

295
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,938
(He was young on his first drama.)

296
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,748
(Kim Tae Hee was also beautiful then.)

297
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:17,218
(It was a special drama for the sister and the brother.)

298
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:19,478
We were brothers and sisters.

299
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:20,748
You were brothers and sisters in the drama.

300
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:23,488
- There was a twist. - You were in the drama together.

301
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:25,818
It was my first drama.

302
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:27,988
- She's your sister. - I hid the fact...

303
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,898
that she was my sister.

304
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:31,958
Right.

305
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:34,398
- I changed my name too. - Right.

306
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,198
- You changed your last name to Lee? - Yes.

307
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:39,738
Even when we bumped into each other, I would just bow and say hi.

308
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:42,808
- Really? - It just occurred to me.

309
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:46,008
- They were both in the drama. - That's insane.

310
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:48,508
- That's right. - You said hi to each other...

311
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:50,348
as if you were strangers.

312
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:53,788
That drama was a big hit. It was big in Japan too.

313
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:55,248
- I watched it too. - When you were in Japan?

314
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:56,488
It was big.

315
00:12:57,358 --> 00:12:59,088
- This is interesting. - It is.

316
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:01,788
- Do you see the color changing? - It's turning red.

317
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:03,598
- Where? - It's red now.

318
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:05,798
Cook it until it's crispy.

319
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:07,328
Can we eat it now?

320
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:09,568
One is about to come out.

321
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:12,368
- You must like the sea. - This looks amazing.

322
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,768
- This makes me happy. - Doesn't it?

323
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:15,368
(This is their savior after not eating for a long time.)

324
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:16,578
This looks good.

325
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:19,238
- It looks amazing. - Try it as is.

326
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:23,878
- How did you take it out? - Is it cooked?

327
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:25,148
- It's good. - Really?

328
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:26,178
It's so good.

329
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:27,988
It's really good.

330
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:29,188
(The grilled shrimp has a special flavor.)

331
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:30,258
You can eat it.

332
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,818
(Hani tries the crab first.)

333
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:35,588
(It makes her shiver in joy.)

334
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:39,258
- It's good. - The shrimp is fully cooked.

335
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:40,498
- How was it? - The shrimp is really good.

336
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:42,998
The crab too. It's savorier.

337
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:44,438
- More than the shrimp? - Yes.

338
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:46,938
- How do you do that? - You can just take it off.

339
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:47,938
Try the shrimp.

340
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:50,878
(Wan gets a bite of the crab.)

341
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,808
It's excellent.

342
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:55,108
It's good, right?

343
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:56,918
- I like the shrimp. - I think the crab...

344
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:57,948
- tastes better. - It's really good.

345
00:13:58,848 --> 00:14:01,788
(Kang Nam eats a shrimp.)

346
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:04,018
(It suits his appetite.)

347
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:06,828
Try the crab.

348
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:08,758
The shrimp is really good.

349
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:09,928
(Crab versus shrimp)

350
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:12,558
(It's either you like crab or shrimp.)

351
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:16,228
It's good.

352
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:17,338
(Kang Nam tries the crab.)

353
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,198
The inside of the crab is good.

354
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,138
- The crab is good, right? - It's good.

355
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:23,068
I told you the crab is good.

356
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,738
It's really good.

357
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:26,448
It's good.

358
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,478
(It's fine as long as it's good.)

359
00:14:27,478 --> 00:14:28,508
The crab is good.

360
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:32,678
- The crab is good. - The crab is really good.

361
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:35,948
- That is our main dish. - There's something we have to do.

362
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:37,818
- That was our appetizer. - It was good.

363
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:39,658
- That was the appetizer. - It looks good...

364
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:41,328
- because water steeped through. - It does.

365
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:43,228
(Crab dish in the jungle)

366
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,828
(How does the herbal steamed mud crab taste?)

367
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:51,298
(This is the real deal.)

368
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:53,338
I'll open it. In 1, 2, 3.

369
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:56,238
(They open the main dish.)

370
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:58,038
Look at the color.

371
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:00,148
Look at the color.

372
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:01,178
(What's wrong with the color?)

373
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:03,048
- It's good. - It's fine.

374
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:06,048
(They laugh at how it looks like.)

375
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:10,558
I don't think we can eat the soup.

376
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:13,258
- The color looks like poison. - Wait, the color...

377
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:16,458
Isn't it because the crab roe spilled out?

378
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:18,328
What should we do with the soup? Are we going to eat it?

379
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:19,728
Should we see if it's good?

380
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:20,828
(It's the fiery pit steamed mud crab.)

381
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:23,268
- Let's eat it. Can we dig in? - Should we? Should we try it?

382
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:25,198
- It looks good. - The crab roe is coming out.

383
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:28,338
(The meat looks delicious.)

384
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:30,838
- Do we have a knife? - Look at the roe.

385
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,348
In 1, 2, 3.

386

(He opens the crab shell.)

387
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:38,718
(It's full of crab roe.)

388
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:41,348
- My gosh. That's amazing. - Look at the roe.

389
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:42,718
(It's the crab roe party at Komodo Island.)

390
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:44,358
- Look at the roe. - It's awesome.

391
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:47,128
- That's amazing. - Look at the roe.

392
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:50,158
(There's so much crab roe.)

393
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,958
- Just leave it as is. - Shouldn't we get rid of the soup?

394
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,768
- What about the soup? - Let's drink it.

395
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:55,868
Try it, Wan.

396
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:58,838
- Crab Man. - Hurry, Crab Man.

397
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:00,438
I hope it's good.

398
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:01,438
(He takes caution and smells it first.)

399
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:02,838
It might smell fishy.

400
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,078
- Try the roe. - What do you think?

401
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:07,608
- Hurry. - Come on.

402
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,748
- Someone else try it. - Give it to me.

403
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,248
- Someone else try it. - Give it to me.

404
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:14,448
Really?

405
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:15,748
(Hani tries it for them.)

406
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:18,318
The roe must be good.

407
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:20,358
(What did I just eat?)

408
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,128
- It has so much sand in it. - What is it?

409
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:23,758
(Smiling)

410
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,228
Do you want to try the roe?

411
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:27,528
- I'll try it. - Did you just put it down?

412
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,828
Why?

413
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:31,068
(He tries it right away.)

414
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:32,098
How is it?

415
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:34,808
(He spits it out.)

416
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:36,808
It's okay. There's meat.

417
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:38,308
- This is not cooked yet. - It is.

418
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:40,248
- It looks good though. - It's not?

419
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,108
- No, it's cooked. - We still have the meat.

420
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:44,648
It's not cooked. It has to be more firm.

421
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,948
- We need a microwave. - What do you call it?

422
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:49,418
Just microwave it. Hurry. Please.

423
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,058
Just microwave it.

424
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:53,428
- Do we have one? - The oil shouldn't be there.

425
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:54,658
Let's close it.

426
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:56,858
- It never happened. - We're going to put it back?

427
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:58,258
- We have to cook it more. - Leave it like that.

428
00:16:58,258 --> 00:16:59,698
It'll cook sooner or later.

429
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:01,498
- Right. - The fire's not strong enough.

430
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,398
- What should we do? - What's that?

431
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:07,308
- I think the oil drained out. - I think so too.

432
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:08,838
(The fish is getting cooked to a golden brown.)

433
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:11,308
(It makes your mouth water, and everybody is happy.)

434
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:14,148
(They're having a party thanks to Byung Man.)

435
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:18,378
(Should we try it?)

436
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:20,088
This needs to be opened.

437
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:22,248
(He opens it.)

438
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:25,988
(Chief is the best.)

439
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:29,428
It looks amazing.

440
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,028
(It's golden brown.)

441
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:33,898
The sound,

442
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:36,398
the smell,

443
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:41,538
and the way it looks are insane.

444
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:45,038
- It'll taste good too, right? - The taste?

445
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:46,648
It's the pandemonium of the five senses.

446
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:50,518
(It gapes open.)

447
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:52,948
(The meat is stuck to the wood.)

448
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,418
- Look at this. - It's the bamboo.

449
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,488
It's the bamboo grilled fish.

450
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,658
You eat this.

451
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:04,128
(There's a lot of meat on it.)

452
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,198
- You should eat this, Chief. - It's okay.

453
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:08,598
- Thank you for the food. - Try it.

454
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:10,468
(He takes a big bite.)

455
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:15,968
(He can't help but smile.)

456
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,978
(Byung Man takes a big bite as well.)

457
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:22,378
(His expression changes while eating.)

458
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:26,718
You might cry again, Dong Keun.

459
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:29,548
Don't cry.

460
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,458
(It's just too good.)

461
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,288
We don't even need salt.

462
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,158
We were so hungry.

463
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,198
(He takes a big chunk.)

464
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:38,398
We need to binge.

465
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:42,868
(He allows himself to eat as much as he wants.)

466
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:46,838
(His expression changes again while eating.)

467
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,268
This is what I wanted.

468
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:54,608
(Jung Sik takes a handful.)

469
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:55,708
This is like bread.

470
00:18:57,278 --> 00:18:58,418
(He agrees.)

471
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:00,618
(The fish is so good that they're delirious.)

472
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:03,488
The meat comes right off the bone.

473
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:04,958
(It tastes great and they have plenty of it.)

474
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,258
This is endless.

475
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:09,228
Eat the skin too.

476
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:12,258
Take the bone right off.

477
00:19:12,258 --> 00:19:14,128
(There's a lot of meat on the bone too.)

478
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:16,838
You can have this...

479
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:18,298
and worry about nothing.

480
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,238
- You need to worry about nothing. - There you go.

481
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:24,378
(He takes the fish...)

482
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:26,908
(and goes to his space.)

483
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:27,978
Look at the meat.

484
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:33,518
(He takes a bite slowly.)

485
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:42,358
(He's one with the fish.)

486
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:46,828
Try the meat.

487
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:48,798
We're not going to have leftovers.

488
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:50,498
(Is this really fish?)

489
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:53,368
Dong Keun tends to eat...

490
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:57,478
good food far away from people.

491
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,108
He goes to the hammock and eats by himself.

492
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:01,408
(He prefers to eat alone.)

493
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:05,278
(He's away from the group.)

494
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:06,618
He's appreciating the taste.

495
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:08,988
(He's in his own world.)

496
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,558
This is chewy.

497
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:13,258
(Even when people are being noisy during dinner,)

498
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,458
(he eats by himself.)

499
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,598
(This is it.)

500
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:21,128
It's because...

501
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:25,338
I want to enjoy the taste as much as I can.

502
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:28,038
When I'm next to people who are eating,

503
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:30,638
I feel like I have to eat fast too.

504
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:33,308
I only chew a few times and swallow.

505
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:36,108
So I'm trying to eat...

506
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:37,518
- as slow as possible. - It almost looks like...

507
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:41,018
you're writing a poem while you eat.

508
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:42,988
He was doing that yesterday too.

509
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:44,958
(He's the poet of the food industry.)

510
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:48,828
I'm full.

511
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,628
Thank you for the food.

512
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:53,728
We'll sleep well tonight.

513
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,998
- We have to wake up early. - It's because we're full right now.

514
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:58,938
When we're sleepy, we'll sleep really well.

515
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,408
We have to protect the island tomorrow.

516
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:02,438
That's right.

517
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:03,908
We have to eat it.

518
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:06,478
(This suits the Komodo Island.)

519
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:07,878
(Good night.)

520
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:12,048
(They get ready for bed.)

521
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:18,858
(Byung Man writes a journal entry before going to bed.)

522
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,358
(Dong Keun copies him.)

523
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:25,158
(It was a perfect day except that they couldn't go home.)

524
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,138
The fire's back on.

525
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:32,468
(It's 12:05am, and they're still cooking the crab.)

526
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:36,108
The crab we had wasn't cooked.

527
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,408
(We miss the Chief.)

528
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,638
- I'm tired. - I want to brush my teeth.

529
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:41,408
- It's 11:56pm. - It's burning.

530
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:43,948
Let's blow on it until the wood burns.

531
00:21:44,218 --> 00:21:45,578
(The steamed crab is not getting cooked.)

532
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:47,248
- The fire... - Leave it.

533
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:49,348
The fire is not strong.

534
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:51,518
(Two hours have passed.)

535
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,518
I'm so hungry.

536
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:58,398
(I miss Byung Man.)

537
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:01,698
- When is it going to be ready? - Should we just roast it?

538
00:22:01,698 --> 00:22:03,068
- Let's steam half of it. - Exactly.

539
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,098
That's right. Let's take half.

540
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:10,178
- Let's open the shell and roast it. - Let's roast it.

541
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:12,878
- Let's do one side here and there. - We can roast it like this.

542
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:14,978
- We can do that. Put it on top. - Roast it.

543
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:17,678
That's right. We can just put it on top.

544
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:18,678
Forget it.

545
00:22:18,678 --> 00:22:20,248
(They don't care about the lemon tree anymore.)

546
00:22:20,248 --> 00:22:22,248
- That's enough. - Kang Nam.

547
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:23,888
- Let's try the legs. - There's nothing.

548
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:25,258
- The legs should be cooked. - I'll take the shell off.

549
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:27,828
- Let's try the legs. - It looks cooked.

550
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:29,258
How do you eat it?

551
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:31,628
- Open it. Use the ax. - We can eat it.

552
00:22:31,628 --> 00:22:34,168
- You just do this. - That's the way.

553
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:35,168
It looks good.

554
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:38,398
(It's full.)

555
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:41,668
It looks good. Try it.

556
00:22:42,138 --> 00:22:44,478
- Crab Man, try it. - Crab Man.

557
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:46,708
- It looks good. - Eat it in one bite.

558
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:48,148
Wait.

559
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:49,248
- This is good. - It's cooked.

560
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:50,718
- Is it? - This one's fine.

561
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:51,818
- It's cooked. - This one's perfect.

562
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:54,348
(He takes off a piece carefully.)

563
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:55,818
(He slurps it down.)

564
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:56,858
How is it?

565
00:22:57,818 --> 00:22:59,858
- Is it good? - Crab Man.

566
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:02,258
This is awesome.

567
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:04,698
(He gets up and gives it to Hani.)

568
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:07,268
(Exclaiming)

569
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:08,298
Is it good?

570
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:11,438
(Kang Nam hurriedly eats it after seeing Hani's reaction.)

571
00:23:11,438 --> 00:23:12,598
(Exclaiming)

572
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,508
- It was merely uncooked. - Jae Hee.

573
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:17,578
- It's perfect. - It wasn't me that was weird.

574
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,038
This is perfect.

575
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,178
- This is better than the crayfish. - I think so too.

576
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:24,148
- It's so good. - It is.

577
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:25,948
It's so good.

578
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:28,488
(Why is he making that face?)

579
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:32,488
(How is my crab?)

580
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:36,128
(Delicious)

581
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:38,228
What is this? It doesn't taste like a snow crab.

582
00:23:38,228 --> 00:23:39,398
It tastes like...

583
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:40,668
- a snow crab and a lobster. - It tastes similar to a king crab.

584
00:23:41,428 --> 00:23:43,738
- It's chewier. - The texture feels like a lobster.

585
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:47,308
(The crab legs are disappearing fast.)

586
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:50,278
This is amazing.

587
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:51,338
(The pincers are full of meat.)

588
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,878
It's a bone.

589
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,378
What does it taste like?

590
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:56,278
It's so good.

591
00:23:56,278 --> 00:23:57,348
(They gobble it down.)

592
00:23:57,548 --> 00:23:58,878
This is so good.

593
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:02,118
(They didn't eat for 20 hours.)

594
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:03,288
It's crunchy and tasty.

595
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:04,418
(This is a crab party.)

596
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,188
This is it. This is perfect.

597
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:09,228
(The body is cooked as well.)

598
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:10,698
Try it.

599
00:24:10,698 --> 00:24:12,198
- We need to cook it a bit more. - No, this is perfect.

600
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,368
- It's hard. - It is hard.

601
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:16,028
This is amazing.

602
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,338
- The smell changed. - Does it?

603
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:23,778
(This piece goes to Wan.)

604
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:25,638
- Look at the meat. - It's hot.

605
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:27,478
Do you need some help?

606
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:29,078
This part is good.

607
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:32,418
This is fine cuisine.

608
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,348
It tastes like an expensive dish.

609
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,818
(It's more flavorful...)

610
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:37,818
The lemon tree makes it taste better.

611
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:39,518
(It's more flavorful thanks to Min Gyu's lemon tree.)

612
00:24:39,518 --> 00:24:40,658
It's hot.

613
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:41,888
(They scrape the roe off.)

614
00:24:41,888 --> 00:24:42,928
It's hot.

615
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:45,028
It's so hot.

616
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:46,768
(There's not a lot, but they share.)

617
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:48,068
It's good.

618
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:49,498
- This is even better. - It's good.

619
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:52,238
(They take care of each other and bond.)

620
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:53,238
That was good.

621
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:55,638
We did really well cooking for ourselves.

622
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,938
- I didn't think we'd be able... - But how is this crab so tasty?

623
00:24:58,938 --> 00:25:00,048
to eat without the Chief.

624
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:03,278
Although it took us five hours longer...

625
00:25:03,578 --> 00:25:07,448
It took us a long time, but we caught it with our own hands.

626
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:09,418
We also cooked for ourselves.

627
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:12,818
- This was so meaningful. - Me too.

628
00:25:12,818 --> 00:25:13,928
(This is their first meal without the Chief.)

629
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:17,458
Let's keep a night watch.

630
00:25:17,858 --> 00:25:19,098
We have to.

631
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:21,668
- Let's do it properly. - Should we do it?

632
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:25,768
Byung Man's Tribe, don't let your guards down.

633
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:27,908
There are deer remains near their shelter...

634
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:31,678
where the Komodo dragon left them during the day.

635
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,448
They just had dinner,

636
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:38,118
so a Komodo dragon might be roaming nearby...

637
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:40,088
with its great sense of smell.

638
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:42,488
I'll do it.

639
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:44,758
The rest of you should sleep. Go to bed.

640
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,658
- Good job, everybody. - It's not good to be here.

641
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:49,188
- Good night. - You can do it.

642
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:50,958
- We ended off well. - Good night.

643
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:53,428
- Thank you. - That was excellent.

644
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:56,598
(Rattling)

645
00:25:58,198 --> 00:25:59,838
(There's a bell sound.)

646
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:04,208
- Is it a boar? - Yes.

647
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:06,108
- Look. - Where?

648
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:10,248
(You can see only its eyes in the dark.)

649
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:13,988
I keep thinking about...

650
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:16,118
when it was biting off the deer's hind leg.

651
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,488
(It might be somewhere in the darkness.)

652
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:22,288
Blood smells a lot.

653
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:26,098
(They were all chilled with fright...)

654
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:28,528
(when the beast had a feast during the day.)

655
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:31,198
It might be eating right now.

656
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:36,978
(It looks like it's roaming about.)

657
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:41,878
I'm more scared than yesterday after seeing the Komodo dragon eat.

658
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:45,248
I need to be a real man.

659
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:46,448
(Sneezing)

660
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,318
I need to be a real man.

661
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:49,348
(He's startled.)

662
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:50,458
What was that?

663
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:53,128
What do real men do?

664
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:54,828
Real men fight through it.

665
00:26:56,598 --> 00:27:00,028
(Min Gyu is the first to stand night watch.)

666
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:02,498
It's scary.

667
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:06,468
A deer died near our shelter.

668
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:08,538
The smell of blood must have spread.

669
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:11,638
Thinking that Komodo dragons will come,

670
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:13,948
the members each took turns to be on guard for an hour.

671
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:17,218
(The watch number 2, Kang Nam)

672
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,678
(I am sorry for walking you up.)

673
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:20,888
How did you sleep here? I'm sorry you had to sleep here.

674
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:25,258
(After an exhausting day, they rub their tired eyes...)

675
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,658
(to keep each other safe through the night.)

676
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:33,928
(The watch number 3, Lee Wan)

677
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:34,998
(I'm sorry.)

678
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:41,408
(He drags his body out of bed...)

679
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:44,208
(and heads to the searchlight by the fence.)

680
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,078
(The watcher number 4, Jae Hee wakes up as well.)

681
00:27:51,678 --> 00:27:54,418
(While the air is cold at night,)

682
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:59,518
(the way they care for each other keeps them warm.)

683
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:03,828
(The team at the dinosaur island went to bed early.)

684
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:09,468
(The trio is sleeping in peace.)

685
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:19,708
(For Jung Sik, who was curled up due to the cold,)

686
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:23,778
(Dong Keun shares the warmth of his blanket.)

687
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:28,348
(The way they care for each other keeps the Tribe as one.)

688
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:35,728
(It's another morning at the jungle.)

689
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:48,268
We should go now.

690
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:50,338
Let's go.

691
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:51,338
(They go on patrol.)

692
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:54,378
(They had decided to patrol the area in the morning.)

693
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:56,848
Can Komodo dragons appear around this area?

694
00:28:57,618 --> 00:28:59,278
They could be hiding.

695
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:00,918
I am a bit nervous since the grass obscures the view.

696
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,058
My goodness.

697
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:06,188
(They follow the beach and the forest...)

698
00:29:06,188 --> 00:29:07,988
(and go up the hill to have a good view.)

699
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,028
The Komodo rangers...

700
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:14,368
sure do hard work.

701
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:19,538
While I have never been to Africa, this place reminds me a bit of it.

702
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:23,478
It really does remind you of Africa.

703
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:27,708
This place doesn't feel like Indonesia, but a country in Africa.

704
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,178
It seriously does.

705
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:31,078
- It looks like Africa, right? - It does.

706
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:32,648
It's like Africa.

707
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:35,688
This island is incredibly beautiful.

708
00:29:36,218 --> 00:29:37,658
Look at the sunrise to your right.

709
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:40,688
(The overwhelming scenery puts them between reality and fantasy.)

710
00:29:40,688 --> 00:29:42,958
It feels like dinosaurs really do live here.

711
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:45,328
I feel like I am on the back of a dinosaur.

712
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:47,798
(It feels like dinosaurs really do live here.)

713
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:50,638
The moment I saw the scenery on the hill,

714
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:53,268
all exhaustion left my body.

715
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:57,238
The Komodo rangers work...

716
00:29:58,138 --> 00:29:59,878
at a very beautiful place.

717
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:02,308
They really coexist...

718
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:05,918
with the nature and the animals.

719
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:11,718
Byung Man's team finally finished patrolling the area.

720
00:30:11,718 --> 00:30:15,558
Watching the striking scenery of the Komodo archipelago,

721
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:18,698
they think about the Komodo rangers' coexistence...

722
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:20,498
with the wild.

723
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:24,768
(How is the morning at Komodo Island?)

724
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,608
(Hani was the last watcher.)

725
00:30:29,638 --> 00:30:34,808
(She patrols the area around the shelter in the morning.)

726
00:30:34,808 --> 00:30:36,208
- It came. - What?

727
00:30:37,248 --> 00:30:38,778
- It came. - What?

728
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:41,148
A Komodo dragon is walking towards us.

729
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:43,218
It's at the end of the light.

730
00:30:43,318 --> 00:30:45,188
A Komodo dragon is walking by.

731
00:30:45,188 --> 00:30:46,688
I think it's walking towards the deer.

732
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:48,728
(Did a Komodo dragon come?)

733
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:50,458
(Is it the one from yesterday?)

734
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:53,568
It looks like it'll come out from here and keep walking that way.

735
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:55,928
It's over there. You can see its face.

736
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:57,998
It's walking towards the deer, right?

737
00:30:57,998 --> 00:30:59,868
(The Komodo dragon circles around the deer carcass.)

738
00:31:00,838 --> 00:31:03,608
(It hides behind a tree for a second.)

739
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:06,378
I see another one over there.

740
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:07,678
- Where? - It's really big.

741
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:09,508
There are two Komodo dragons.

742
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:11,178
I see 1 and 2.

743
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:14,288
(Loitering)

744
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:15,518
My gosh. There it is.

745
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:23,088
(They still remember what they saw yesterday.)

746
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:28,068
(Both Komodo dragons move towards the deer carcass.)

747
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:31,368
They are eating the deer.

748
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:34,008
Did they come to eat the deer?

749
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:35,808
(How did the two Komodo dragons come here?)

750
00:31:36,238 --> 00:31:38,538
- Is that the deer? - Yes, it is.

751
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:44,378
Komodo dragons can smell something that is 10km away.

752
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:48,618
Detecting the smell of a deer carcass,

753
00:31:48,618 --> 00:31:50,158
Komodo dragons begin to swarm.

754
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:53,628
(They dig into the carcass as if it's a competition.)

755
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:58,898
(The scene is as imposing as it was yesterday.)

756
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:02,298
(The Komodo rangers circle the fence.)

757
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:03,538
Are they mating?

758
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:07,168
- Kang Nam, you have to see this. - Come here.

759
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,738
Come here.

760
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:11,738
(It turns out they are a romantic pair.)

761
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:13,408
- Kang Nam, you have to see this. - Come here.

762
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:14,408
Come here.

763
00:32:14,408 --> 00:32:16,008
- They are mating. - Come here and look.

764
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:21,718
One Komodo dragon climbed on top of the other dragon.

765
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:23,258
Was it the one in the back?

766
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:24,688
- Wait a minute. - It's running away.

767
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:27,228
(Running away)

768
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:29,328
I guess it doesn't like the other one.

769
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:31,058
Be careful.

770
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,268
They must have met each other for the first time.

771
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:37,838
(What is going on?)

772
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:42,068
The two Komodo dragons are male.

773
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:49,178
The strongest male komodo dragons fight during the mating season.

774
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:53,888
Currently, the two are checking each other's strength.

775
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,388
"What kind of a male is it? Is it strong or not?"

776
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:00,428
Okay.

777
00:33:00,428 --> 00:33:01,728
They are fighting to figure out...

778
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:05,228
who is stronger. Was that a fight?

779
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:10,538
(The winner eats alone.)

780
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:12,698
Ever since we came to this island,

781
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:17,208
don't you think we saw almost every behavior...

782
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,538
of the Komodo dragons?

783
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:21,678
(After showing the members how it competes for food,)

784
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:23,618
(the Komodo dragon leaves.)

785
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:32,958
We spotted Komodo dragons and searched the forest.

786
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:37,528
The sea has interesting things other than Komodo dragons.

787
00:33:38,758 --> 00:33:39,798
The sea?

788
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:41,868
If there are Komodo dragons on the land,

789
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:43,238
then there is something...

790
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,498
- in the sea. - There's something there.

791
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:45,538
Really?

792
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:46,638
In Komodo Island,

793
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:49,138
there is another kind of a king...

794
00:33:49,138 --> 00:33:50,978
other than Komodo dragons.

795
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:52,008
(The king of the sea)

796
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:53,708
With fear and excitement,

797
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:57,378
they prepare to go to the sea.

798
00:33:58,818 --> 00:34:02,318
Byung Man's team spent the night at another island.

799
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:04,318
They will join the other members at the sea.

800
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:09,388
Byung Man's Tribe goes to meet the king of the sea.

801
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:13,998
What kind of surprising experiences will they have at the sea?

802
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:15,198
(They go to the sea, a place of endless possibilities.)

803
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:18,598
(The members of the Tribe reunite in the middle of the sea.)

804
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:21,808
- Hey. - Did you have a meal?

805
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:24,908
Why am I so happy to see them?

806
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:25,978
(They are happy to see each other after a day.)

807
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:29,948
(Byung Man's Tribe goes to find the king of the sea.)

808
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:32,378
Let's go.

809
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:34,048
(They promptly get ready.)

810
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:36,788
Go catch a lot of fish for us.

811
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:39,258
(Refreshing water surrounds their bodies.)

812
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:42,658
(Byung Man takes the lead...)

813
00:34:42,658 --> 00:34:46,228
(and the other members of Byung Man's Tribe jump in.)

814
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:49,698
(If they want to be free of their exhaustion,)

815
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:52,638
(the sea is wide and deep enough.)

816
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:56,338
(A school of fish welcomes them.)

817
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,508
(The scenery is a treat to their eyes.)

818
00:34:58,508 --> 00:35:02,508
"Finding Nemo" moved me a lot.

819
00:35:02,508 --> 00:35:05,948
I felt like I was watching a real-life version of it.

820
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:09,858
It was so pretty. I looked around with excitement.

821
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:15,188
(The scenery is just like it is in an animated film.)

822
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,828
(It is the symbol of luck.)

823
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:22,398
(A turtle is spotted.)

824
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:24,338
It was so cute.

825
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:28,538
A sea turtle is a symbol of luck...

826
00:35:28,538 --> 00:35:29,838
and a good omen.

827
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:33,908
I thought to myself, "Bring us luck", and then sent him on his way.

828
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:34,908
(What luck awaits them?)

829
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,218
(What is the king of the sea?)

830
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,548
(The tribe members move forward with Byung Man in the lead.)

831
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,258
(They look around carefully.)

832
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:49,828
(They make a swift turn.)

833
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:52,428
(Chaotic)

834
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:55,368
(Byung Man's camcorder)

835
00:35:55,368 --> 00:35:58,298
(Byung Man slowly moves forward by himself.)

836
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,378
(A graceful silhouette swims in the sea.)

837
00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:11,378
(The living king of the sea is before them.)

838
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,048
(Byung Man's recording)

839
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:20,858
(The manta ray is 7 to 8m wide and weighs 0.5 to 1.5t.)

840
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:24,628
The flying carpet.

841
00:36:25,698 --> 00:36:26,868
It really looked...

842
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:31,338
like a piece of fabric or a carpet...

843
00:36:31,638 --> 00:36:35,538
was flying in the wind.

844
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:36,708
(The manta ray seemed like it was a flying carpet.)

845
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:41,308
I felt like I was watching the scene unfold...

846
00:36:41,678 --> 00:36:42,948
on a big screen.

847
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,548
It moved forward...

848
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:48,288
and swam downwards.

849
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:51,958
It was like a spacecraft. I was in awe.

850
00:36:59,158 --> 00:37:00,768
It was like a fairy.

851
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:04,468
The time slowed down. It moved slowly...

852
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:05,968
in a relaxed manner.

853
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:09,608
I was so happy to see it in front of me.

854
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:20,048
(The manta ray and Byung Man's Tribe swim together.)

855
00:37:23,788 --> 00:37:29,058
(They respect each other's space.)

856
00:37:30,158 --> 00:37:35,328
They coexist with the nature and the animals.

857
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:38,668
They even get bitten by Komodo dragons from time to time.

858
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:41,708
Some Komodo rangers had to quit because they were bitten,

859
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:45,608
but they still coexist with the Komodo dragons...

860
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:47,778
and protect them.

861
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:52,118
I thought that must be why...

862
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,188
the Komodo dragons haven't gone extinct.

863
00:37:56,188 --> 00:37:59,088
It's hard to protect them.

864
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:02,328
It's hard to preserve the nature.

865
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:05,258
The Komodo rangers made me realize it. I am very happy...

866
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:07,968
that I got to meet amazing people.

867
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:10,398
Working with the Komodo rangers,

868
00:38:10,398 --> 00:38:13,438
Byung Man's Tribe learned to coexist with the nature.

869
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:16,708
It's time to meet the new Byung Man's Tribe.

870
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:25,148
(They will face a different legend.)

871
00:38:26,548 --> 00:38:29,088
(It's the fantasy world you dreamed about.)

872
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:31,758
I love fantasy novels. They are the best.

873
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:32,818
(If this fantasy world appeared before your eyes...)

874
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:34,688
If I become a hero in a fantasy novel...

875
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:41,028
These are things that don't happen in real life.

876
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:46,068
Before the nature, people are incredibly small beings.

877
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:50,278
These moments will go on the records of my life.

878
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:54,408
(The new Byung Man's Tribe stands amidst the primitive nature.)

879
00:38:56,248 --> 00:38:57,918
(The legend of hobbit)

880
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,048
They say hobbits live on this island.

881
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,088
It was fascinating.

882
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:06,388
Thousands of islands make a band like the Milky Way.

883
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,628
Flores Island is a remote island in the East...

884
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:13,728
that has the mythology of the Ebu Gogo, the little people.

885
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:19,168
They had the height of 1m and hairy bodies.

886
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:23,638
They lived in the cave inside the rush forest.

887
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:26,708
After the 20th century, they gained another name.

888
00:39:27,508 --> 00:39:29,918
They were called hobbits.

889
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:35,488
It's homo floresiensis.

890
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:41,558
(It's the legend of survival.)

891
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:42,828
The legend of the hobbit.

892
00:39:42,828 --> 00:39:46,498
(The 8 new members of the Tribe)

893
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:48,768
(Find traces of a hobbit)

894
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:50,568
Bats!

895
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:52,798
(They explore a deep cave like in the legends.)

896
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:57,438
(In 2003, 18,000-year-old skeletons were found in Flores Island.)

897
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:01,448
(They are in the land of the primitives.)

898
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:02,778
(They welcome the nature with their bodies.)

899
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:04,078
We are living like the hobbits.

900
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:06,788
It's the legend of the hobbits and Byung Man's Tribe.

901
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:09,988
(Another fantasy will be written.)

902
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:11,018
- The Law of Jungle, - The Law of Jungle,

903
00:40:11,018 --> 00:40:12,488
- the fellowship of the hobbits. - the fellowship of the hobbits.

904
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:17,928
They found us. Let's run away.

905
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:18,958
(The best friends finally come together.)

906
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,198
For goodness' sake.

907
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:21,228
My goodness.

908
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:22,298
It's Gollum.

909
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:25,438
(It's a hobbit.)

910
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:27,538
(Byung Man and I look like people who have always lived here.)

911
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:29,708
Don't we?

912
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:33,608
(We are small, but our teamwork is perfect.)

913
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:37,118
(Everything is small here.)

914
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:39,448
(It's the story of two real hobbits in the land of the hobbits)

915
00:40:39,448 --> 00:40:40,488
There is nothing to eat.

916
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,888
(He specializes in interpreting the language of the hobbit.)

917
00:40:44,888 --> 00:40:46,258
(Surreptitious)

918
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:48,658
(The tall member likes it too.)

919
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:52,428
(I feel like a character in a fantasy novel.)

920
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:55,668
(I feel like I can do anything with Byung Man.)

921
00:40:55,668 --> 00:40:57,198
(He works on improving his comedic skills in front of his best friend.)

922
00:40:57,968 --> 00:41:02,508
(You are such a small hobbit.)

923
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:04,838
(Soo Geun keeps making people laugh.)

924
00:41:05,308 --> 00:41:07,548
I lack the energy...

925
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,278
(It's always a happy jungle.)

926
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:13,018
The fellowship of the hobbits.

927
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:15,118
- Thank you. - Thank you.

928
00:41:15,948 --> 00:41:17,118
Banana!

929
00:41:17,118 --> 00:41:20,458
Welcome to the land of the legend, Flores Island.

930
00:41:20,888 --> 00:41:23,828
- We now know the island's name. - Which game will we play?

931
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:26,868
- The time stopped. - Let's have a meeting first.

932
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:28,168
The time stopped.

933
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:30,198
- This is now... - Should we stay still?

934
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:31,968
Lee Soo Geun's The Law of Jungle.

935
00:41:31,968 --> 00:41:33,868
(This is now Lee Soo Geun's The Law of Jungle.)

936
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:35,068
(He makes everyone laugh from the start.)

937
00:41:35,068 --> 00:41:36,978
No one is tired.

938
00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:39,578
Let's get started with Season Two.

939
00:41:39,578 --> 00:41:40,648
- It's your first time, right? - What?

940
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:42,078
It's your first time on The Law of Jungle, right?

941
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:43,118
(Soo Geun plays around like fish in the water.)

942
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:44,248
(Byung Man responds by pulling his ear.)

943
00:41:45,448 --> 00:41:46,948
(He greets his best friend like so.)

944
00:41:48,388 --> 00:41:50,858
(The atmosphere softens.)

945
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:52,488
(Soo Geun's presence makes Byung Man cheerful.)

946
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:53,728
He was waiting.

947
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:55,888
I thought he would be exhausted.

948
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,428
- I am exhausted. - Are you?

949
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:58,598
(Byung Man and Soo Geun finally meet.)

950
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:00,728
Lee Soo Geun.

951
00:42:01,328 --> 00:42:04,698
He puts me at ease.

952
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:08,638
I can depend on him emotionally.

953
00:42:08,638 --> 00:42:10,308
Even I am curious...

954
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,978
about how Soo Geun will do in The Law of Jungle.

955
00:42:13,278 --> 00:42:17,448
People will see that Byung Man is the comedian.

956
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:21,088
He and I will have a lot of fun in the jungle.

957
00:42:21,518 --> 00:42:23,818
It will be like "Gag Concert" in the jungle.

958
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:24,918
(Look forward to the Funny Jungle Show.)

959
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:27,088
- I am sorry. - He says he's sorry.

960
00:42:27,288 --> 00:42:28,458
My goodness.

961
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,058
(A more joyful Part 2 is coming up.)

962
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:34,328
We have perfect looks.

963
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:38,981
We actually had a meeting.

964
00:42:38,981 --> 00:42:43,151
The theme is Chief Byung Man's healing time.

965
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:46,121
We prepared a colorful show for Chief Byung Man.

966
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:49,291
I can't wait. When you are in the jungle,

967
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:52,261
you only have to worry about eating and sleeping.

968
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:53,991
- Just forget about everything else. - Only eating and sleeping.

969
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:55,031
Forget about everything else.

970
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,561
I talked to the people in the village.

971
00:42:58,001 --> 00:42:59,701
They agreed to take me in for a night.

972
00:42:59,861 --> 00:43:01,531
A little boy told me to sleep at his house.

973
00:43:01,531 --> 00:43:03,901
- You talked to the people already. - What did they...

974
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:05,971
What did they say?

975
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:07,571
- What? - What did they say?

976
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:09,441
Hurry up and come on down.

977
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:11,541
- What? - Hurry up and come on down.

978
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:13,041
- "Come on down." - "Come on down."

979
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:15,211
- "Come on down." - "Come on down."

980
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:17,751
(His joke suits my taste.)

981
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:22,291
I can't wait to see how much he will joke around.

982
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:26,391
I can't wait to see how much Soo Geun will joke around.

983
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:28,991
He keeps trying to host a talk show.

984
00:43:29,461 --> 00:43:32,561
Among the female idol singers who visited the program,

985
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,601
- she wore the most appropriately. - He's right.

986
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:36,941
Bugs won't go in.

987
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:38,471
She didn't worry about style.

988
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:40,371
She likes to swim.

989
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:42,241
- She likes to swim, - I heard she's good at swimming.

990
00:43:42,241 --> 00:43:43,841
but we ended up on a mountain.

991
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:46,011
(She smiles prettily no matter where she is at.)

992
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:49,381
I want to give strength to a lot of people.

993
00:43:49,381 --> 00:43:52,951
I am red ginseng, which is one level above vitamin.

994
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:54,191
- Red ginseng? - That's right.

995
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:57,491
(Ye Rin shows her cuteness in 3 different ways.)

996
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:02,761
(GFriend has the strongest fandom and digital music sales.)

997
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:03,831
(GFriend's newest song, "Love Whisper" takes top 1.)

998
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:06,101
(She is the center.)

999
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,731
(Ye Rin)

1000
00:44:09,301 --> 00:44:11,501
(She has unexpected charms.)

1001
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:13,441
(Sweet and scary)

1002
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:16,311
She is easygoing and fearless.

1003
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:17,341
(She is armed with good cheer.)

1004
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,851
(She is scarier when she eats.)

1005
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:21,851
(Her eyes are fierce.)

1006
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:24,121
(She is so cute.)

1007
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:27,521
(The red ginseng is coming soon.)

1008
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:31,561
- I am red ginseng. - Red ginseng?

1009
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:33,731
I am red ginseng of the group.

1010
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:36,391
It's better than vitamin.

1011
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:37,601
Are you saying that you brought red ginseng?

1012
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:39,861
No, I am red ginseng.

1013
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:43,641
- You are red ginseng. - You're not mad, right?

1014
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:47,611
How long has it been since your daughter was born?

1015
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:48,771
It has been 10 days.

1016
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:50,681
- It has been 10 days. - It has only been 10 days.

1017
00:44:50,681 --> 00:44:52,181
- He should have stayed at home... - Why is he here?

1018
00:44:52,181 --> 00:44:53,711
- to watch his beautiful baby. - He's here in the jungle.

1019
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:55,051
Hello.

1020
00:44:55,511 --> 00:44:57,781
I am an actor, Choi Won Young.

1021
00:44:59,051 --> 00:45:00,621
(He played Kim Chul Gyu in "A Hundred Year Legacy".)

1022
00:45:00,621 --> 00:45:02,091
(He married Sim Yi Young,)

1023
00:45:02,091 --> 00:45:03,821
(an actress who played his wife in the same drama.)

1024
00:45:03,821 --> 00:45:05,821
That's how we met.

1025
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:10,061
After becoming a family and having a child,

1026
00:45:10,301 --> 00:45:12,201
many things changed.

1027
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:14,401
Your wife gave birth the day before yesterday.

1028
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:16,471
That's right. It was the day before yesterday.

1029
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:20,411
It feels different to have a second child.

1030
00:45:20,411 --> 00:45:23,171
I have more stability.

1031
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:26,811
I have to leave for The Law of Jungle.

1032
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:28,151
Next week?

1033
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:29,751
Are you going away for three nights?

1034
00:45:29,981 --> 00:45:31,051
I am going away for two nights.

1035
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:32,581
- For two nights? - Yes.

1036
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:35,051
There are two.

1037
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:36,551
(Throwing)

1038
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,861
Are you giving this to me?

1039
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:43,031
- Will the magic wand protect me? - Yes.

1040
00:45:43,931 --> 00:45:45,701
(This is the joy of raising a daughter.)

1041
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:49,271
(Daddy will be back.)

1042
00:45:50,241 --> 00:45:51,241
Coming to a place like this is...

1043
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:53,511
because you and your wife are on bad terms, right?

1044
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,871
Your kid has nothing to do with this.

1045
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:57,281
(Soo Geun is just kidding.)

1046
00:45:57,281 --> 00:45:58,581
It's an escape from parenting.

1047
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:00,481
- It's paternity leave. - There was...

1048
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:01,581
- a great project. - He's on paternity leave.

1049
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:02,851
So I jumped on the opportunity.

1050
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:07,191
Whenever people asked "Which show do you want to be on?",

1051
00:46:07,191 --> 00:46:09,051
- I said "The Law of Jungle". - Really?

1052
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:10,791
- She really wanted to on the show. - Since I wasn't famous.

1053
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:16,231
Pilates is actually very close to nature.

1054
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:20,101
I want to really challenge myself.

1055
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:21,871
I want to go to the jungle.

1056
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:26,301
(Pilates is very useful for one's survival.)

1057
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:27,871
- Nice. - Good.

1058
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:30,011
(She's exercising and making a fire at once.)

1059
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:31,781
Do you need flexibility to do pilates?

1060
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:34,211
(A survival story of a sportswoman)

1061
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:37,651
There aren't many who can try pilates in nature.

1062
00:46:37,981 --> 00:46:39,991
I majored in sports psychology.

1063
00:46:40,391 --> 00:46:42,551
I can lead and assist people.

1064
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,891
I want to be a helpful person.

1065
00:46:46,091 --> 00:46:47,161
- I see. - Great.

1066
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:49,731
- So she did want to come here. - I was surprised.

1067
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,961
How do you feel about joining the show?

1068
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:54,031
- Tae Hwan. - I...

1069
00:46:54,471 --> 00:46:56,971
Honesty, I don't think of this as a variety show.

1070
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:58,701
I'll consider this as a documentary.

1071
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:00,741
I've done a lot of research on the internet.

1072
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:02,141
I'm going to survive.

1073
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:03,881
I'm going to learn everything from the Chief.

1074
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:05,111
(Lee Tae Hwan is an actor.)

1075
00:47:05,111 --> 00:47:06,651
I'm Lee Tae Hwan, an actor.

1076
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:11,781
(He performed with Lee Jong Suk in "W" in 2016.)

1077
00:47:11,781 --> 00:47:16,191
I recently finished "Father, I'll Take Care of You".

1078
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:17,961
A lot of people recognize me.

1079
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:23,501
(He has the perfect body for the jungle.)

1080
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:27,271
(A middle-aged man is jealous.)

1081
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:34,771
(With a superb physique, he becomes the jungle's body guard.)

1082
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,311
(Her heart races.)

1083
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:39,081
(He's survival is a documentary.)

1084
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:40,711
Everything seemed like a movie to me.

1085
00:47:41,781 --> 00:47:43,051
(He's peeling coffee beans in his mouth.)

1086
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:48,021
(He's a human thresher.)

1087
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:50,421
You won't be able to fall asleep because of coffee.

1088
00:47:51,091 --> 00:47:52,321
(He's serious.)

1089
00:47:53,661 --> 00:47:56,961
(Be ready to fall for his innocent charm.)

1090
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:59,301
I want them to relax and be energized.

1091
00:47:59,661 --> 00:48:01,831
Did you know that there were...

1092
00:48:01,831 --> 00:48:04,301
supposed to be eight of you?

1093
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:06,101
- That's right. - Yes.

1094
00:48:06,271 --> 00:48:07,871
- There were eight. - Right.

1095
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:09,811
- Hong Bin of VIXX will... - Hong Bin.

1096
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:12,381
join you after his concert in Taiwan.

1097
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:15,851
Hello, I'm Hong Bin of VIXX. It's nice to meet you.

1098
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,521
(Hong Bin is a member of VIXX.)

1099
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:19,521
I'll just go there with some luggage.

1100
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:20,921
I'll do stuff when I get there.

1101
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:21,951
(He sounds like a tough guy.)

1102
00:48:22,051 --> 00:48:23,251
It's not like I'm not going to die.

1103
00:48:23,251 --> 00:48:24,591
(He's very passionate.)

1104
00:48:25,221 --> 00:48:28,191
We've been to the jungle, so we're helping him pack.

1105
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:29,291
I got it the second time.

1106
00:48:30,231 --> 00:48:33,301
- 1, 2, 3. - Let's go!

1107
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:34,471
Good luck.

1108
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:36,771
Good luck.

1109
00:48:36,771 --> 00:48:40,211
(After 12 hours)

1110
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,111
Hello.

1111
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:45,181
(He looks depressed.)

1112
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:50,051
I had to make a transfer,

1113
00:48:50,751 --> 00:48:53,651
but I missed it because I had wrong information.

1114
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,491
I missed my transfer.

1115
00:48:55,491 --> 00:48:57,891
(Hong Bin couldn't get on the plane to the jungle.)

1116
00:48:59,991 --> 00:49:02,961
I'm waiting for my luggage.

1117
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:06,871
(He is alone in Hong Kong without a manager.)

1118
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:08,831
I had work in Taiwan.

1119
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:11,441
I was supposed to fly to Hong Kong than transfer...

1120
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:14,311
to a flight to Bali.

1121
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:17,511
I missed the flight because I had wrong information.

1122
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:20,811
First, I tried to deny the reality, but then I accepted it.

1123
00:49:21,411 --> 00:49:24,751
Then I tried to find a solution.

1124
00:49:25,621 --> 00:49:27,651
(First stage is denying the reality.)

1125
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:28,691
I'm...

1126
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,121
really sorry.

1127
00:49:30,121 --> 00:49:33,391
(Second stage is accepting the reality.)

1128
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:36,561
I'll find a way to get there soon.

1129
00:49:37,231 --> 00:49:39,431
(After 4 hours of waiting)

1130
00:49:39,831 --> 00:49:41,501
Right now...

1131
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:42,531
(He's in a hotel in Hong Kong.)

1132
00:49:42,531 --> 00:49:44,501
it's two in the morning.

1133
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:45,671
(He left the airport.)

1134
00:49:45,671 --> 00:49:49,241
There was no flight, so I went to a hotel.

1135
00:49:49,671 --> 00:49:52,581
But it was full, so I went back to the airport.

1136
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:57,021
I kept waiting, looking, and I kept repeating that.

1137
00:49:57,451 --> 00:49:58,521
And now it's this late.

1138
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:00,121
(I used to be so passionate.)

1139
00:50:00,121 --> 00:50:02,191
(Now all I can do is sigh.)

1140
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,591
My luggage is...

1141
00:50:03,591 --> 00:50:05,361
(Instead of the Tribe...)

1142
00:50:05,361 --> 00:50:06,391
here with me.

1143
00:50:06,391 --> 00:50:07,431
(only his luggage is with him.)

1144
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:09,631
My poor luggage.

1145
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:12,701
I'll fly to Bali tomorrow morning.

1146
00:50:13,671 --> 00:50:16,571
(He'll spend the night in Hong Kong and fly out the next day.)

1147
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:20,141
He's in a city jungle instead.

1148
00:50:20,611 --> 00:50:22,111
Is he joining us?

1149
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:25,011
Hong Bin wants to be here no matter what.

1150
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:26,781
He's coming here without a manager.

1151
00:50:27,751 --> 00:50:29,611
- Alone? - That must be hard.

1152
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:32,051
I'm so stupid.

1153
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:33,951
(He's completely lost it.)

1154
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:37,661
I can't believe I missed the flight.

1155
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:41,031
(Will Hong Bin be able to arrive in the jungle safely?)

1156
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:44,661
He has a good heart. He's really passionate about this.

1157
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:45,661
- It isn't easy. - He has passion.

1158
00:50:45,661 --> 00:50:46,771
Right. It isn't easy.

1159
00:50:46,771 --> 00:50:48,831
You will go into...

1160
00:50:49,301 --> 00:50:51,101
the jungle behind you.

1161
00:50:51,101 --> 00:50:52,141
- Okay. - It's so pretty there.

1162
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:54,311
- Yes. - It's so pretty.

1163
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:55,541
- It is. - It's pretty.

1164
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:56,681
- Okay. - Are we going there?

1165
00:50:57,381 --> 00:50:58,511
Let's go.

1166
00:50:58,611 --> 00:51:00,851
The Tribe is headed to the forest with a legend.

1167
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:03,781
In a deep forest without human touch,

1168
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:08,291
what kind of mysterious things will happen there?

1169
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:10,361
(The Tribe goes to find the land of Hobbit.)

1170
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,691
Byung Man.

1171
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:17,301
Shouldn't we get these coconuts here, now?

1172
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:18,301
(He suggests picking the coconuts.)

1173
00:51:18,301 --> 00:51:19,861
(He found them at the entrance to the village.)

1174
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:22,171
Shall we pick one or not? Is it...

1175
00:51:23,131 --> 00:51:25,601
too high? It's too hard, isn't it?

1176
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:26,671
(It's up too high.)

1177
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:28,471
Soo Geun, shall we get some?

1178
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:30,441
It's too dangerous, isn't it?

1179
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:31,441
(The tree is 15m tall.)

1180
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:32,511
It's up too high.

1181
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:33,951
Gosh, it's too tall.

1182
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:37,321
(When they're about to give up on their dream...)

1183
00:51:37,321 --> 00:51:39,181
- Gosh. - Don't do it.

1184
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:40,191
- No. - Goodness.

1185
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:41,221
(Byung Man climbs up.)

1186
00:51:41,591 --> 00:51:43,091
You should wear this belt.

1187
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:45,921
Be careful, Byung Man.

1188
00:51:46,461 --> 00:51:47,761
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1189
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:48,761
Should I get one too?

1190
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:50,361
(Jae Hee decides...)

1191
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:51,361
(to pick a small one.)

1192
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:52,731
(He'll climb a shorter tree.)

1193
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:53,801
I can do it.

1194
00:51:55,171 --> 00:51:57,241
(He's showing an example as an experienced member.)

1195
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:00,371
There are more here.

1196
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:02,511
Jae Hee is picking them.

1197
00:52:05,281 --> 00:52:07,611
(Byung Man is already half way up the tree.)

1198
00:52:10,051 --> 00:52:11,081
Be careful, Byung Man.

1199
00:52:11,551 --> 00:52:12,551
Don't I look like a caterpillar?

1200
00:52:15,451 --> 00:52:16,491
Go for it!

1201
00:52:18,391 --> 00:52:20,191
- Goodness. - Amazing.

1202
00:52:20,191 --> 00:52:21,691
I feel like I'm watching a movie.

1203
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:22,791
(This isn't computer graphics, is it?)

1204
00:52:23,461 --> 00:52:25,761
- Gosh. - That's so cool.

1205
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:26,801
(This is the basics.)

1206
00:52:28,871 --> 00:52:30,771
(He reaches the top in no time.)

1207
00:52:32,171 --> 00:52:34,471
(He's relaxed even when he's 15m off the ground.)

1208
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:35,841
(This is why he's the chief.)

1209
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:37,241
I got it.

1210
00:52:37,611 --> 00:52:39,081
(They're watching the Chief.)

1211
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:40,081
I got it.

1212
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:41,251
I think I can get this.

1213
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:45,581
(Jae Hee is working hard even when nobody is watching.)

1214
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,191
- Gosh. - What's going on?

1215
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:48,791
I'm tired.

1216
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:52,621
You can't get tired. If you are, then I'll have to be the Chief.

1217
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:54,291
(You can do it, Chief!)

1218
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:55,561
- What? - Does he need to split it?

1219
00:52:55,761 --> 00:52:57,631
(Please look at me.)

1220
00:52:57,631 --> 00:52:58,761
What do we have to do with it?

1221
00:52:59,461 --> 00:53:01,471
(It's the Chief's show time!)

1222
00:53:03,131 --> 00:53:04,541
Gosh. That's amazing.

1223
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,571
- Gosh. That's amazing. - I've only seen it on TV.

1224
00:53:07,571 --> 00:53:08,611
(Awesome!)

1225
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:11,341
(The Chief teaches them by showing.)

1226
00:53:11,341 --> 00:53:13,581
I'm too tired to pick them. I'll get one.

1227
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:16,451
- I'll just pick one. - Be careful.

1228
00:53:16,451 --> 00:53:17,551
Just have a taste.

1229
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:19,481
Hey, be careful.

1230
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:23,091
You pick your own. I'll only get one for me.

1231
00:53:24,421 --> 00:53:26,121
No. You'll scrape your hands.

1232
00:53:26,931 --> 00:53:27,991
Be careful.

1233
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:29,031
(When Byung Man heads down...)

1234
00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:30,231
You need to support your bottom.

1235
00:53:30,831 --> 00:53:33,771
(he struggles without anyone watching him.)

1236
00:53:33,771 --> 00:53:34,771
Byung Man.

1237
00:53:35,571 --> 00:53:37,101
(He's skillful.)

1238
00:53:37,571 --> 00:53:38,671
Please take this.

1239
00:53:40,071 --> 00:53:41,171
Please take this one.

1240
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:43,811
Help me.

1241
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:45,741
- Be careful. - I have no strength.

1242
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:47,711
- Gosh. - Good work.

1243
00:53:47,711 --> 00:53:48,781
(They applaud and praise him.)

1244
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:50,751
- You're awesome. - My gloves...

1245
00:53:50,951 --> 00:53:52,781
I've never seen something like this.

1246
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:56,021
(Jae Hee climbs down alone.)

1247
00:53:56,021 --> 00:53:57,691
You'll hurt yourself climbing like that.

1248
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,161
A vice chief should be able to do this.

1249
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,371
Chief and vice chief picked coconuts for us.

1250
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,041
Are you okay?

1251
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:12,501
It's lighter than it looks.

1252
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:13,811
- Good job. - Nice.

1253
00:54:13,811 --> 00:54:16,471
- Let's try one. - This one.

1254
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:18,541
- Let's try one. - Do we break it?

1255
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:20,511
(Nice!)

1256
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:25,051
(He breaks it and drinks from it.)

1257
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:30,191
- It's fresh. - Take it.

1258
00:54:30,761 --> 00:54:32,461
(He drinks like a tough guy.)

1259
00:54:32,721 --> 00:54:34,561
- Nice. - We should finish it.

1260
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:37,101
- That's cool. - I'll drink like him.

1261
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:39,061
- Gosh. - Drink it like a man.

1262
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:40,071
It's good.

1263
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:41,931
- My turn. - Yes.

1264
00:54:41,931 --> 00:54:43,201
- Gosh. - I'll drink it like a man.

1265
00:54:44,771 --> 00:54:45,841
I'll be quick.

1266
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,711
That's awesome.

1267
00:54:47,711 --> 00:54:50,611
(Fresh drink)

1268
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:51,681
Let's try it.

1269
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:53,111
Does it taste different?

1270
00:54:53,181 --> 00:54:54,211
- Here. - It's sweet.

1271
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:55,551
(You can't taste this in a studio.)

1272
00:54:55,551 --> 00:54:58,281
- Look. I even got some meat. - It's like watermelon.

1273
00:54:58,551 --> 00:54:59,991
- It's good. - Does it taste different?

1274
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:01,491
It's sweet.

1275
00:55:01,491 --> 00:55:03,221
Lean back. That's right.

1276
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:04,261
(It's Tae Hwan's turn.)

1277
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:07,561
It's good.

1278
00:55:08,191 --> 00:55:09,231
(Dancing)

1279
00:55:09,831 --> 00:55:10,831
Isn't it delicious?

1280
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:12,261
- Is it good? - Yes.

1281
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:13,531
- It's delicious. - This is the best.

1282
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:15,101
I'll try it.

1283
00:55:15,531 --> 00:55:16,971
- It tastes like an energy drink. - It's like...

1284
00:55:16,971 --> 00:55:18,341
fresh watermelon.

1285
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:19,371
Yes, it tastes fresh.

1286
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:20,771
Here.

1287
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:24,041
I think it tastes more delicious...

1288
00:55:24,441 --> 00:55:26,611
because the Chief went up there and got it.

1289
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:27,911
(He is happy to hear that.)

1290
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:30,221
- He set an example. - Please take good care of me.

1291
00:55:30,221 --> 00:55:31,221
Take good care of us.

1292
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:33,021
- You're great. - Shall we put it in here?

1293
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:34,751
- Well... - There's an ax.

1294
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:35,821
Right here.

1295
00:55:35,921 --> 00:55:38,161
(He creates a funny skit.)

1296
00:55:38,991 --> 00:55:40,291
Thank you. Let's go.

1297
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:41,861
- Mine is really big. - What's that?

1298
00:55:41,861 --> 00:55:42,931
- Does it take one hour and half? - Let's go.

1299
00:55:43,431 --> 00:55:44,701
- Do we need to walk for 1.5 hours? - It's...

1300
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:46,561
I'm starving now though.

1301
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:48,831
The ground is so muddy.

1302
00:55:48,831 --> 00:55:51,141
(The Tribe sets out to find the cave with the legend.)

1303
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:52,201
(How will it look?)

1304
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:54,441
Are we going into the jungle at last?

1305
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:56,681
From this point on, there are no traces of people.

1306
00:55:57,641 --> 00:55:58,841
Gosh, it's so tiring.

1307
00:55:58,841 --> 00:56:00,411
(The Chief takes the lead as always.)

1308
00:56:00,411 --> 00:56:02,811
(He walks into this unfamiliar jungle without any hesitation.)

1309
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:07,421
(Soo Gun, a close friend of the Chief, follows him.)

1310
00:56:07,421 --> 00:56:09,851
You're not tired, are you?

1311
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,761
No, I'm happy to be here.

1312
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:15,991
I'm honored that I can star on a show...

1313
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:18,231
my friend hosts.

1314
00:56:19,361 --> 00:56:21,971
- Be careful starting now, everyone. - Okay.

1315
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,501
- It's horrible... - Be careful.

1316
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:26,001
- if you sprain your ankle. - Okay.

1317
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:27,971
3 or 4 days would go by so quickly.

1318
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:31,281
- It's dangerous since we can't see. - What should I do?

1319
00:56:31,281 --> 00:56:32,511
- I can't see the path. - The path...

1320
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,081
Should I cut this and go?

1321
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:35,511
This is a jungle.

1322
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:38,481
This is a real jungle.

1323
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:43,121
(It's a rugged and dense jungle.)

1324
00:56:43,221 --> 00:56:46,321
(And the ground is muddy.)

1325
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:49,061
Be careful over there.

1326
00:56:50,731 --> 00:56:52,701
On the ground,

1327
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:55,131
there are a lot of branches. If you slip on it,

1328
00:56:55,131 --> 00:56:56,701
you will be hurt badly.

1329
00:56:56,701 --> 00:56:57,741
- Okay. - Okay.

1330
00:56:57,741 --> 00:56:59,841
You need to be on your guard. There are so many of this.

1331
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:03,981
(Even when he's crossing a pit,)

1332
00:57:03,981 --> 00:57:06,611
(he takes care of the younger members.)

1333
00:57:08,251 --> 00:57:09,351
(Jumping)

1334
00:57:09,351 --> 00:57:11,151
Do I have to jump like him?

1335
00:57:11,151 --> 00:57:12,781
- Where should I step on? - On here.

1336
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:17,491
Excellent. Let's go now.

1337
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:19,721
(Soo Geun is building a strong character for Tae Hwan.)

1338
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:21,331
- He has such long legs. - They're no jokes.

1339
00:57:21,331 --> 00:57:22,961
- They are so long. - They are like the bridges.

1340
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:24,661
The name serves a purpose.

1341
00:57:24,661 --> 00:57:26,031
Then what about yours?

1342
00:57:26,031 --> 00:57:27,201
I have short legs.

1343
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:31,301
I feel very reassured.

1344
00:57:32,401 --> 00:57:34,341
I don't have to talk because he's doing them for me.

1345
00:57:34,341 --> 00:57:35,411
(He feels at ease.)

1346
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:36,441
He does them on his own.

1347
00:57:38,781 --> 00:57:41,911
Look. We have to take the surrounding path.

1348
00:57:41,911 --> 00:57:44,121
(He's a comedian that will make everyone laugh in the jungle.)

1349
00:57:44,121 --> 00:57:45,181
Hello.

1350
00:57:45,181 --> 00:57:46,351
(Let me say hello.)

1351
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:51,321
(Ye Rin is following them with the best she can.)

1352
00:57:52,491 --> 00:57:54,831
- I'm having fun. - You're having fun so far?

1353
00:57:54,831 --> 00:57:56,631
So far? Did you say, "so far"?

1354
00:57:56,631 --> 00:57:58,061
Will it be scary from now on?

1355
00:57:58,831 --> 00:58:00,271
It's fun for now.

1356
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:05,371
I think wherever I go,

1357
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:08,011
I'll survive well.

1358
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:10,081
I have a strong will to survive.

1359
00:58:10,081 --> 00:58:11,081
(An unyielding survival instinct)

1360
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:14,711
I really want to live a long life.

1361
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:17,051
(Her dream is unusual for an idol singer.)

1362
00:58:18,951 --> 00:58:21,621
(I have to lead a long life.)

1363
00:58:23,421 --> 00:58:26,961
Doesn't Ye Rin look like the youngest member of a hiking club?

1364
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,461
Yes!

1365
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:34,101
(Ye Rin, the youngest member of a hiking club, looks around.)

1366
00:58:34,471 --> 00:58:36,501
I wish a chicken would walk past us here.

1367
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:37,871
- A chicken? - Yes.

1368
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:41,071
(Walking with stealthy tread)

1369
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:46,781
(This is a hunting skill of catching a chicken with bare hands at once.)

1370
00:58:46,781 --> 00:58:48,211
That's how he catches chickens.

1371
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:49,251
(She's fast.)

1372
00:58:50,521 --> 00:58:51,551
I think this is okay.

1373
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:53,351
There must be a lot of snakes here.

1374
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:55,221
We can roast the snakes and eat.

1375
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,521
You're a girl though.

1376
00:58:57,521 --> 00:58:59,591
(Ye Rin is dreaming of living long as she recharges her energy here.)

1377
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:02,031
(Cute)

1378
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:05,501
I don't think we can find food here.

1379
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:07,331
(Their journey for the cave continues.)

1380
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:08,601
Watch your head.

1381
00:59:11,641 --> 00:59:12,701
(Tae Hwan takes care of others.)

1382
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:15,011
Thank you. Thank you.

1383
00:59:15,741 --> 00:59:17,781
I used to do a lot of house chores.

1384
00:59:17,781 --> 00:59:19,681
I do a lot of work that may not be so visible.

1385
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,981
When we film at restaurants,

1386
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:25,381
I'm always the last one coming out and brings our stuff.

1387
00:59:25,381 --> 00:59:28,791
I'm sort of like the Snail Bride in the fable.

1388
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,121
(He pushes the tree that's sticking out.)

1389
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:33,531
Be careful.

1390
00:59:33,691 --> 00:59:36,161
(He even takes care of the crew courteously.)

1391
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:38,261
Goodness, why did it break? Now, I feel bad.

1392
00:59:39,031 --> 00:59:40,431
I'm sorry, tree.

1393
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:42,871
I'm surrounded by nature...

1394
00:59:43,501 --> 00:59:45,071
like the palm trees.

1395
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:46,071
(Won Young moves like a middle-aged man.)

1396
00:59:47,141 --> 00:59:49,311
(He smells the nature.)

1397
00:59:50,141 --> 00:59:53,881
The jungle is very jungle-like.

1398
00:59:54,251 --> 00:59:56,281
This feels great.

1399
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:59,551
I bet I'll say I want to go home an hour later.

1400
00:59:59,551 --> 01:00:00,691
(He's nervous.)

1401
01:00:00,691 --> 01:00:01,991
Please let me go home.

1402
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:07,661
(Jae Hee takes big strides at the end of the line.)

1403
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:09,961
I have gloves, so it's better.

1404
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:11,331
It's because I'm just tired.

1405
01:00:12,001 --> 01:00:13,601
(His legs must've given way for picking coconuts.)

1406
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:15,571
- Wait. - Let me help you.

1407
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,671
- Jae Hee, get some rest and come. - I'm fine. I'm serious.

1408
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:21,971
I'm not a chief assistant.

1409
01:00:21,971 --> 01:00:24,281
I've just been here longer than they have, but they keep calling me that.

1410
01:00:24,281 --> 01:00:25,481
- It's making me uneasy. - Hey.

1411
01:00:25,481 --> 01:00:27,011
Be careful. We have to be careful.

1412
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,511
Hey, if we go at this pace, we're going to get lost.

1413
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:30,981
Let's hurry.

1414
01:00:32,051 --> 01:00:33,181
Chief!

1415
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:36,621
Chief Kim! You have to take us. Why are you going on your own?

1416
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:38,491
What?

1417
01:00:39,061 --> 01:00:40,891
- Byung Man. - Yes?

1418
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:42,761
- Hey, you! - What?

1419
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:44,961
We have to go all together!

1420
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:49,601
You have to hurry then.

1421
01:00:50,501 --> 01:00:54,011
The girls can't keep up with you.

1422
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:55,841
I'm right here.

1423
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:56,881
(Ye Rin caught up quickly.)

1424
01:00:56,881 --> 01:01:00,651
Why are you slower than the girls?

1425
01:01:02,611 --> 01:01:04,651
Has it been a while since you two met? Or do you meet often?

1426
01:01:04,651 --> 01:01:06,251
- We don't see each other often. - You don't?

1427
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:10,061
When he's free, he works on...

1428
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,561
getting the skydiving instructor license.

1429
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:15,131
So that makes me worry about him.

1430
01:01:15,131 --> 01:01:18,131
He enjoys extreme sports.

1431
01:01:18,401 --> 01:01:20,831
It's great having a hobby...

1432
01:01:20,831 --> 01:01:24,501
for men in their 40s like us.

1433
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:27,271
He has to think about his health though.

1434
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:28,341
(That's his wish.)

1435
01:01:31,411 --> 01:01:34,281
(The Chief feel energetic as he's with his friend.)

1436
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:36,881
(Rushing)

1437
01:01:38,021 --> 01:01:39,421
Can't you hear the sound of water?

1438
01:01:40,491 --> 01:01:41,521
I do.

1439
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:43,091
- I can hear the water. - It's water.

1440
01:01:43,091 --> 01:01:44,361
It's water.

1441
01:01:44,361 --> 01:01:46,021
(The Tribe arrives at a lake nearby their destination.)

1442
01:01:46,021 --> 01:01:47,191
Great.

1443
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:50,031
I can see the water.

1444
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:54,271
(The Chief is concealing himself.)

1445
01:01:54,271 --> 01:01:55,871
Here's a great spot.

1446
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,341
(Approaching carefully)

1447
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:02,171
(Hiding)

1448
01:02:02,211 --> 01:02:03,781
(Startled)

1449
01:02:03,811 --> 01:02:06,681
(He pulls a prank which he doesn't usually do since he's friend here.)

1450
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,111
I felt dizzy for a moment.

1451
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:10,721
I thought you saw me here.

1452
01:02:10,721 --> 01:02:12,581
The cave with the legend is...

1453
01:02:12,581 --> 01:02:15,691
located under the waterfall that you see here.

1454
01:02:16,921 --> 01:02:17,961
That's the location.

1455
01:02:17,961 --> 01:02:19,721
Would you want some pork belly meat?

1456
01:02:20,231 --> 01:02:21,631
I'll get it ready.

1457
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:23,501
Sit. Let's have some pork belly meat.

1458
01:02:23,501 --> 01:02:24,901
(Jungle Hiking Club's outing)

1459
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:27,501
Let me grill the meat.

1460
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:31,071
(Sizzling)

1461
01:02:31,071 --> 01:02:32,271
That's a wet wipe.

1462
01:02:34,311 --> 01:02:36,011
(Wringing)

1463
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:39,011
(He's sweating.)

1464
01:02:39,281 --> 01:02:40,551
Why are you grilling a wet wipe?

1465
01:02:41,051 --> 01:02:43,621
(The Chief tries grilling the pork belly meat.)

1466
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:45,681
Your fingers are burning.

1467
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:51,791
We used to do this kind of skits.

1468
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:53,631
Let's scream our slogan...

1469
01:02:53,631 --> 01:02:55,231
- and go down. - The slogan.

1470
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,461
Ridge!

1471
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:58,401
Let's climb it!

1472
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:03,301
(The Chief takes the lead again.)

1473
01:03:04,971 --> 01:03:08,511
(The cave next to the lake is their final destination.)

1474
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:10,281
Step on this.

1475
01:03:10,611 --> 01:03:12,411
- Good job. - Okay.

1476
01:03:13,141 --> 01:03:16,051
(Soo Geun is on his way to follow his friend.)

1477
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:22,091
(He was jumping confidently.)

1478
01:03:22,091 --> 01:03:23,621
(Stopping)

1479
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:26,061
(It's a cliff.)

1480
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:27,891
Hey, don't come here.

1481
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:28,961
Oh, my goodness.

1482
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:30,601
Hey, be careful over there.

1483
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:31,831
Come this way.

1484
01:03:33,161 --> 01:03:34,971
(Slippery)

1485
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,441
(It makes their bodies stagger.)

1486
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:41,041
I... What do I do? Look at that.

1487
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:42,241
- Goodness. - I...

1488
01:03:42,771 --> 01:03:44,041
How did he go down there?

1489
01:03:45,941 --> 01:03:48,511
(This is the place the Tribe must go.)

1490
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:51,521
(It's a mysterious cave with the legend of hobbits.)

1491
01:03:53,051 --> 01:03:55,851
(It's disconnected from the outside world as it has no entrance.)

1492
01:03:56,051 --> 01:03:58,891
(How are they going to go down to this cave?)

1493
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:04,231
(The Chief looks down without saying anything.)

1494
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:06,131
(Let me think.)

1495
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:09,331
My legs are shaking.

1496
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:10,841
(Trembling)

1497
01:04:10,841 --> 01:04:12,101
I'm shaking here.

1498
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:14,611
I'm trembling.

1499
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:16,211
Now I feel like I'm in a jungle.

1500
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,881
What is the height?

1501
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:20,851
It's about 15m.

1502
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:22,481
(The height is approximately 15m.)

1503
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:26,691
We weren't going to lower the rope...

1504
01:04:26,691 --> 01:04:29,791
in order to climb down.

1505
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:33,431
We had to climb down as we lower the rope ourselves.

1506
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:37,461
It was a safe way to go down.

1507
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:39,201
That's the thought I had in mind.

1508
01:04:40,301 --> 01:04:42,201
- We have to use the rope. - Then you should go down first.

1509
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:43,501
- We have to climb down by the rope? - Yes.

1510
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:45,471
Let me show you how to climb down first.

1511
01:04:45,471 --> 01:04:47,211
- You're going to use this? - Yes.

1512
01:04:48,111 --> 01:04:50,841
It's quite high. It's over 10m.

1513
01:04:50,911 --> 01:04:53,241
- Are you serious? - Everyone, be on your guard.

1514
01:04:53,241 --> 01:04:54,681
I'm afraid of heights.

1515
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:57,081
I have acrophobia.

1516
01:04:57,081 --> 01:04:59,781
I get sick just by looking at high places.

1517
01:04:59,781 --> 01:05:01,651
I don't look at the ground since it makes me feel nauseous.

1518
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:05,121
I was taken aback and flustered.

1519
01:05:05,121 --> 01:05:06,191
(It threw her off.)

1520
01:05:08,061 --> 01:05:10,361
I'm an icon of worry.

1521
01:05:10,361 --> 01:05:12,031
I always think and worry about things.

1522
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:14,331
I even watch out for the falling leaves.

1523
01:05:14,901 --> 01:05:17,641
When I walk, I'm on my guard. What is it falling?

1524
01:05:19,671 --> 01:05:22,611
(This is making me worry.)

1525
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:26,711
When we climb down here, there will be a cave.

1526
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:27,781
(The Tribe must overcome their fear.)

1527
01:05:27,781 --> 01:05:29,811
Our goal is to go to that cave.

1528
01:05:31,621 --> 01:05:34,751
Goodness, it's finally starting. We have to climb down there?

1529
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:36,491
This is unbelievable.

1530
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:37,791
(The Chief installs the safety ropes.)

1531
01:05:39,321 --> 01:05:41,291
(Dazed)

1532
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:43,531
Watch the Chief going down first.

1533
01:05:43,531 --> 01:05:45,831
If you think you can't go down by rope,

1534
01:05:45,831 --> 01:05:50,141
there's a route you can take, but it goes around the cliff though.

1535
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:55,171
This is a vertical route which is fast and safe as long as they can...

1536
01:05:55,171 --> 01:05:56,441
overcome their fear.

1537
01:05:56,641 --> 01:06:00,611
Or there's a dangerous, winding trail that goes around the mountain.

1538
01:06:00,651 --> 01:06:02,451
This is a barren, mountainous path.

1539
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:06,581
Their journey to the legend isn't easy.

1540
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:09,921
Now, all they have left to do is decide.

1541
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:15,091
(The Chief is ready to climb down.)

1542
01:06:18,001 --> 01:06:21,031
(After checking the safety one more time...)

1543
01:06:21,031 --> 01:06:25,171
If you put your weight over here when you're going down, you'll slip.

1544
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:27,041
- Should we lean back? - Lean back.

1545
01:06:27,371 --> 01:06:28,441
Trust the rope.

1546
01:06:28,671 --> 01:06:30,211
If the rope is right there, how will you go down?

1547
01:06:30,211 --> 01:06:32,041
We are going to take these two off later.

1548
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:34,011
We are going to hook it over here.

1549
01:06:34,651 --> 01:06:38,181
Here's the rope. Hold it here.

1550
01:06:38,451 --> 01:06:42,121
Go down slowly. You're releasing your grip in the back slowly.

1551
01:06:42,991 --> 01:06:45,491
If you want to stop, you have to pull the rope.

1552
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:48,291
(Getting up)

1553
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:50,561
We will go down first...

1554
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:52,231
to check the rope is safe and working.

1555
01:06:52,431 --> 01:06:54,971
So you guys can come down at ease.

1556
01:06:55,531 --> 01:06:56,531
(Saying it is easy.)

1557
01:06:56,531 --> 01:06:57,901
I can do it,

1558
01:06:58,501 --> 01:07:01,071
but it's scary going down.

1559
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:04,941
- I'll go down. - Okay.

1560
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:07,381
- I'll release you when you go down. - Okay.

1561
01:07:07,381 --> 01:07:09,051
- Byung Man, be safe. - You can do it!

1562
01:07:09,051 --> 01:07:10,481
(They cheer for him energetically.)

1563
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:11,881
Be careful.

1564
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:16,221
- It's scarier because we can't see. - We can't see a thing.

1565
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:18,661
- It's scarier because we can't see. - We can't see...

1566
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:22,231
- a thing. - There's a rope when you're here.

1567
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:27,331
(Slowly, step by step,)

1568
01:07:27,331 --> 01:07:31,901
(he sets foot into the cave of the legend.)

1569
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,011
(Feeling nauseous)

1570
01:07:36,741 --> 01:07:37,841
My feet can't reach.

1571
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:40,081
We have to lift our legs like we are rappelling down.

1572
01:07:40,081 --> 01:07:41,551
(Is it the rope or the dangerous trail?)

1573
01:07:41,551 --> 01:07:43,451
If I do this, I can stop myself from going down.

1574
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:44,581
That's right. Hold the rope.

1575
01:07:44,581 --> 01:07:46,451
- Just like this? - I can't wait to try it.

1576
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:50,161
(There isn't a place he can put his feet.)

1577
01:07:51,991 --> 01:07:53,931
When you reach this point, there are vines.

1578
01:07:57,301 --> 01:08:00,701
(The Chief gets down as he steps on the vines.)

1579
01:08:03,201 --> 01:08:06,041
(When he loosens his grip of the rope,)

1580
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:09,671
(he moves down smoothly.)

1581
01:08:09,671 --> 01:08:11,911
(Rappelling down isn't hard.)

1582
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:21,151
(In no time, the Chief has come down halfway.)

1583
01:08:22,321 --> 01:08:24,891
(Soo Geun feels nervous as he watches Byung Man.)

1584
01:08:25,921 --> 01:08:27,631
(She's free from...)

1585
01:08:27,631 --> 01:08:30,631
(all the distraction.)

1586
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:36,531
(It's a frightening descent of 15m of the cliff.)

1587
01:08:36,531 --> 01:08:39,741
(Now, he has 5m left to go.)

1588
01:08:43,281 --> 01:08:46,541
(As he gets closer to the ground, he looks calmer than before.)

1589
01:08:48,111 --> 01:08:50,951
(He finishes his descent.)

1590
01:08:50,951 --> 01:08:52,151
Gosh, the cave.

1591
01:08:55,591 --> 01:08:58,791
(At last, he is face to face with the final destination.)

1592
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:02,261
(This is a cozy, mysterious cave of the legend...)

1593
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:06,131
(where the primitive hobbits once lived.)

1594
01:09:13,541 --> 01:09:14,541
It worked.

1595
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:15,811
(He checks the safety.)

1596
01:09:15,811 --> 01:09:17,111
Come down.

1597
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,411
(He calls for his tribesmen and women.)

1598
01:09:18,411 --> 01:09:20,681
(Just trust me and come on down.)

1599
01:09:21,681 --> 01:09:22,751
Byung Man.

1600
01:09:22,751 --> 01:09:23,821
(Soo Geun gets ready.)

1601
01:09:23,821 --> 01:09:24,851
I don't think he did.

1602
01:09:24,851 --> 01:09:26,281
- Byung Man. - Chief!

1603
01:09:26,481 --> 01:09:27,691
It's good.

1604
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:29,391
(It's safe.)

1605
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:31,261
(The place is good too.)

1606
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:34,561
This is quite stiff.

1607
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:36,131
- It doesn't go down smoothly. - I'll see you later.

1608
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:38,401
Hold it tightly.

1609
01:09:38,561 --> 01:09:39,661
You can do it!

1610
01:09:39,661 --> 01:09:40,671
(He slowly goes down.)

1611
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:43,201
- Aren't you scared? - If I hold it tightly...

1612
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:45,971
Right now? I'm not scared because I can't see.

1613
01:09:46,201 --> 01:09:48,671
I should lean back. It's really tight.

1614
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,281
(He starts to walk backward into the cliff.)

1615
01:09:50,581 --> 01:09:51,811
Lean your upper body.

1616
01:09:51,841 --> 01:09:53,481
There's nothing to step on starting this point.

1617
01:09:54,011 --> 01:09:56,481
- There are vines here though. - Step on the vines.

1618
01:09:56,481 --> 01:09:58,651
(The Chief is coaching Soo Geun from below.)

1619
01:10:03,121 --> 01:10:04,421
Goodness, Byung Man.

1620
01:10:06,361 --> 01:10:08,461
You can slightly step on the vines.

1621
01:10:08,461 --> 01:10:11,031
- What? - Step on the vines carefully.

1622
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:12,831
I'm going to the side. What is this?

1623
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:15,201
(He's dangling from the end of the ground.)

1624
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:17,171
How is it so empty here?

1625
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:19,541
Release the grip of your right hand little by little.

1626
01:10:19,901 --> 01:10:21,041
You got it.

1627
01:10:21,641 --> 01:10:23,171
- I think I leaned back too much. - There you go.

1628
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:24,311
That's it.

1629
01:10:25,481 --> 01:10:26,711
Look at Ye Rin's face.

1630
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:29,351
It's the face of someone with acrophobia.

1631
01:10:31,681 --> 01:10:34,351
(It's a worried look with the helmet on.)

1632
01:10:35,051 --> 01:10:37,691
Loosen your grip slightly. Release it.

1633
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,891
Even if you come down at once, it's okay. I can pull it from here.

1634
01:10:40,431 --> 01:10:41,531
You'll be fine.

1635
01:10:41,531 --> 01:10:43,431
(Sliding down)

1636
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:44,861
My hand is getting hot.

1637
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:46,031
Come down.

1638
01:10:47,271 --> 01:10:48,801
(Come down a bit more.)

1639
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:51,801
- I'm in such a weird position. - That's it.

1640
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:54,011
There you go. Release the grip of your right hand.

1641
01:10:54,811 --> 01:10:57,011
That's it. There you go.

1642
01:10:57,741 --> 01:10:59,641
Can't I straighten my back?

1643
01:10:59,641 --> 01:11:01,351
When I pull it like this, you won't fall.

1644
01:11:01,351 --> 01:11:02,381
You don't have to.

1645
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:05,621
You have to hold the upper part. Slowly. That's it.

1646
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:07,591
Okay. Now, you have to stand up.

1647
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:09,451
- Hold on. There you go. - Gosh, this is hard.

1648
01:11:09,451 --> 01:11:11,391
- You got it. - This is too hard.

1649
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:14,491
You did it. Hey, you can't fall backward.

1650
01:11:15,531 --> 01:11:16,731
You're going to fall in the water.

1651
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,031
You have to hold this part.

1652
01:11:18,031 --> 01:11:19,101
- I knew it. - You have to hold this.

1653
01:11:19,101 --> 01:11:20,631
I couldn't have done it myself.

1654
01:11:21,531 --> 01:11:24,901
Byung Man was holding the rope safely from the ground.

1655
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:25,901
(Thank you, my friend.)

1656
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,311
- I have to put this on. - I think I have to change.

1657
01:11:30,581 --> 01:11:33,751
I can't feel it's real since I didn't look down.

1658
01:11:33,851 --> 01:11:35,051
I can't feel it.

1659
01:11:36,111 --> 01:11:37,481
(They feel more nervous as they watch Soo Geun going down.)

1660
01:11:37,481 --> 01:11:41,221
(Should I go around it?)

1661
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:44,521
(On the other hand, he feels at ease since he climbed down.)

1662
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:48,091
(He enters the legendary lake after taking off his shirt.)

1663
01:11:50,531 --> 01:11:52,931
(Goodness, this is nice.)

1664
01:11:54,531 --> 01:11:55,531
Is there anything?

1665
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:56,531
(He wants to goof around.)

1666
01:11:57,941 --> 01:11:59,441
I should go that way.

1667
01:12:00,371 --> 01:12:01,811
Goodness, the water is so cool.

1668
01:12:02,241 --> 01:12:03,581
You're going over?

1669
01:12:03,581 --> 01:12:04,741
(Okay, this is the time.)

1670
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:08,311
(Lowering his pants)

1671
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:10,151
Okay. Fine. Stop it.

1672
01:12:11,281 --> 01:12:12,851
(He smacks his bottoms out of love.)

1673
01:12:12,851 --> 01:12:14,121
Gosh, it hurts.

1674
01:12:16,961 --> 01:12:18,991
(He's satisfied with an elementary skit.)

1675
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:22,391
(I can't lose out to him.)

1676
01:12:24,161 --> 01:12:27,731
(He climbs on top of the rock.)

1677
01:12:27,731 --> 01:12:28,831
What?

1678
01:12:29,531 --> 01:12:32,001
He's a hobbit! A hobbit.

1679
01:12:34,371 --> 01:12:36,911
(His facial expression is impressive.)

1680
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:41,551
(He finishes up with a massage from the waterfall.)

1681
01:12:42,951 --> 01:12:45,821
(The cool water pierces into his body.)

1682
01:12:47,021 --> 01:12:49,221
(He's happy that his friend likes it.)

1683
01:12:49,961 --> 01:12:52,261
I'm getting the good energy from this trip.

1684
01:12:53,121 --> 01:12:54,131
Byung Man.

1685
01:12:54,131 --> 01:12:55,531
(I like it here.)

1686
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,831
(However, they can't be at ease.)

1687
01:12:58,831 --> 01:13:00,371
Let me put this on for you.

1688
01:13:00,371 --> 01:13:02,801
(Next up is...)

1689
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:05,201
(Won Young, the icon of worry.)

1690
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:08,171
Won Young, how did you manage to decide to take the rope?

1691
01:13:08,171 --> 01:13:10,211
(The reason that gave him the courage to stand at the cliff)

1692
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:12,111
(Ta-da)

1693
01:13:12,841 --> 01:13:13,851
(It's the lucky magic wand.)

1694
01:13:13,851 --> 01:13:15,451
This is the lucky magic wand I need in times of danger.

1695
01:13:16,311 --> 01:13:17,981
Hadn't I challenged myself at that moment,

1696
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:19,951
I thought I'd compromise...

1697
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:23,151
and look for something that would make my life easier.

1698
01:13:23,621 --> 01:13:27,891
The fear and my worrisome thoughts were fighting each other.

1699
01:13:27,891 --> 01:13:29,591
During that battle, I made my choice.

1700
01:13:31,701 --> 01:13:34,431
My daughter gave me this to protect me from the crocodile.

1701
01:13:34,431 --> 01:13:36,071
- She said to carry it at all times. - That's so cute.

1702
01:13:36,671 --> 01:13:39,471
(Middle-aged men might be weak, but dads are strong.)

1703
01:13:39,471 --> 01:13:41,111
(My daughter, Daddy is coming.)

1704
01:13:41,241 --> 01:13:42,241
Should I put it on?

1705
01:13:42,841 --> 01:13:44,641
(I want to see my dad too.)

1706
01:13:46,681 --> 01:13:49,211
(Won Young moves to the starting point.)

1707
01:13:49,651 --> 01:13:50,651
Let's start.

1708
01:13:50,651 --> 01:13:51,921
(He can only sigh.)

1709
01:13:52,751 --> 01:13:53,821
Be careful.

1710
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:55,721
- Go for it! - You can do it!

1711
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:57,521
I will be back.

1712
01:13:57,521 --> 01:13:58,891
Try to withstand it with your legs.

1713
01:13:58,891 --> 01:14:00,731
I'd like to cheer for my family.

1714
01:14:00,731 --> 01:14:02,291
- Good luck! - I'll see you down there.

1715
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:04,331
- Stretch your legs. - Bye.

1716
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:05,801
- All right. - At once, you have to...

1717
01:14:06,831 --> 01:14:07,931
I got it.

1718
01:14:07,931 --> 01:14:09,201
(Can he become a strong dad?)

1719
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:11,671
Lower yourself a bit. If you stand up straight,

1720
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:13,241
- you might get stuck. - Should I sit down?

1721
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,341
Yes.

1722
01:14:15,141 --> 01:14:16,611
This is the spot.

1723
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:20,381
(It's the section the rock disappears.)

1724
01:14:20,551 --> 01:14:21,681
This is it.

1725
01:14:21,811 --> 01:14:23,551
(Slippery)

1726
01:14:26,021 --> 01:14:27,021
That's great.

1727
01:14:27,021 --> 01:14:28,451
(It's a relief that he looks calm.)

1728
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:31,161
(As he remembers his precious family,)

1729
01:14:31,161 --> 01:14:32,291
(he steps down courageously.)

1730
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:33,931
You are such a cool dad!

1731
01:14:35,731 --> 01:14:36,731
(Goodness)

1732
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:39,461
- The view is magnificent. - The scenery is awesome.

1733
01:14:39,461 --> 01:14:40,701
It's incredible.

1734
01:14:41,171 --> 01:14:44,841
I thought I shouldn't be scared and let my fear get the better of me.

1735
01:14:44,941 --> 01:14:46,101
I thought about good things.

1736
01:14:46,371 --> 01:14:49,741
I climbed down as I thought about my family whom I miss so much.

1737
01:14:50,911 --> 01:14:53,481
(He starts to enjoy the ride down to the cave.)

1738
01:14:53,481 --> 01:14:55,951
(Honey, are you watching?)

1739
01:14:57,021 --> 01:14:58,821
(He approaches the destination.)

1740
01:14:58,821 --> 01:14:59,821
Hey.

1741
01:15:01,291 --> 01:15:02,451
That tree hit me.

1742
01:15:02,451 --> 01:15:03,891
(He picks up the speed.)

1743
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:06,631
(He makes a perfect landing.)

1744
01:15:06,631 --> 01:15:08,631
You were waiting for me. Thank you.

1745
01:15:08,631 --> 01:15:10,401
He successfully landed!

1746
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:12,731
(Won Young, the icon of worry, succeeds his challenge.)

1747
01:15:14,271 --> 01:15:15,531
(Feeling proud)

1748
01:15:15,531 --> 01:15:16,901
You were already bathing.

1749
01:15:18,571 --> 01:15:19,571
Really?

1750
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:20,811
(Jung Won goes down fearlessly.)

1751
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:24,341
(She gets herself ready with the mind of a sportswoman.)

1752
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:27,911
Loosen your grip of your right hand. Release it more.

1753
01:15:28,151 --> 01:15:30,181
More. You can come down more.

1754
01:15:31,621 --> 01:15:33,821
- Great. Stand up. Step on the rock. - Well done.

1755
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,851
Step on it and stand up.

1756
01:15:35,851 --> 01:15:36,921
(She succeeds in an instant.)

1757
01:15:38,391 --> 01:15:40,231
It's not as smooth as I thought it'd be.

1758
01:15:40,231 --> 01:15:42,261
I can rely on the rope then.

1759
01:15:42,631 --> 01:15:44,361
I will see you down there.

1760
01:15:44,661 --> 01:15:46,731
- I can do this. - Let go of your left hand.

1761
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:47,731
(Exceptional strength)

1762
01:15:47,731 --> 01:15:48,771
That's right.

1763
01:15:48,771 --> 01:15:50,271
There you go.

1764
01:15:50,271 --> 01:15:51,371
(He's serious.)

1765
01:15:51,371 --> 01:15:52,541
- I can't see. - You want to come down?

1766
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:53,571
He's good.

1767
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,141
Go, marine!

1768
01:15:56,241 --> 01:15:57,711
Marine who did this all the time!

1769
01:15:58,011 --> 01:15:59,441
I can even do this in my sleep.

1770
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:03,051
- That's right. - Hold it.

1771
01:16:03,321 --> 01:16:04,421
- I'm doing it. - He's right.

1772
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:05,781
(He's fast, and comes down safely.)

1773
01:16:05,781 --> 01:16:07,051
Look at the ground.

1774
01:16:07,051 --> 01:16:08,391
(He's fast, and comes down safely.)

1775
01:16:08,391 --> 01:16:09,451
He didn't let go yet.

1776
01:16:10,521 --> 01:16:11,661
What is this?

1777
01:16:11,661 --> 01:16:12,721
(Jae Hee lands safely.)

1778
01:16:12,721 --> 01:16:16,131
(Now, the youngest member, only Ye Rin remains.)

1779
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:18,601
I can't talk anymore.

1780
01:16:18,601 --> 01:16:19,661
(Ye Rin has acrophobia.)

1781
01:16:19,661 --> 01:16:20,731
I keep thinking about this.

1782
01:16:24,241 --> 01:16:26,541
I wondered if I could do it when it was so high.

1783
01:16:27,441 --> 01:16:30,941
I did question myself if I was capable of doing it.

1784
01:16:31,581 --> 01:16:34,281
Everyone was older than I am.

1785
01:16:34,281 --> 01:16:36,651
With the thought that they are protecting me,

1786
01:16:36,651 --> 01:16:38,981
I could overcome my fear although it was very hard.

1787
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:41,291
At that point,

1788
01:16:41,321 --> 01:16:45,091
I started to think I was capable of going down 15m.

1789
01:16:45,421 --> 01:16:46,421
You can do it!

1790
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:48,331
(It was hard for the last one to decide to climb down.)

1791
01:16:48,331 --> 01:16:50,461
This is scary, sir.

1792
01:16:51,261 --> 01:16:53,331
If I go down safely,

1793
01:16:53,331 --> 01:16:55,371
I will treat you something tasty in Korea.

1794
01:16:55,371 --> 01:16:56,641
Okay, sure.

1795
01:16:59,171 --> 01:17:00,671
- Should I go? - Step back.

1796
01:17:00,671 --> 01:17:05,111
(At last, Ye Rin's challenge begins.)

1797
01:17:05,111 --> 01:17:08,111
I'm holding the rope, so don't worry and let go of the rope slowly.

1798
01:17:08,111 --> 01:17:09,851
Let go of it. That's it.

1799
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:11,581
- You won't fall. - Loosen the grip of the right hand.

1800
01:17:11,581 --> 01:17:14,021
- Release your left hand's hold. - You can do this!

1801
01:17:14,021 --> 01:17:15,491
(Everyone roots for her with one heart.)

1802
01:17:16,891 --> 01:17:17,991
Just lie back.

1803
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:19,891
(She slips.)

1804
01:17:19,891 --> 01:17:21,831
Just lean back from where you are.

1805
01:17:21,961 --> 01:17:23,601
- What should I do? - Lean back. Don't hold the rope.

1806
01:17:24,001 --> 01:17:25,461
- Just lower yourself. - Lower my feet?

1807
01:17:25,461 --> 01:17:26,461
Lean back.

1808
01:17:26,501 --> 01:17:27,601
Lean back!

1809
01:17:28,301 --> 01:17:29,371
Lean back!
