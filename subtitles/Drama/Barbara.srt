1
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,637
There is no finer material
in the whole world.

2
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,116
What is this?

3
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,319
Calico ....
and silk.

4
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,639
Something of everything.
Even silk stockings.

5
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,668
Are those silk stockings?

6
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,079
Try them on.
Just try them on.

7
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,351
Aren't they fine?

8
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,070
You should try
the brocaded shoes, too.

9
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,991
How much are they?
- I won't charge you much.

10
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,115
I've also got garters.
I have everything.

11
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,517
Have you seen this?

12
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,394
Look at this.
I'll just take my dress off.

13
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,311
Is this all right?

14
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,240
Gabriel, you have to go
downstairs.

15
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,550
Yes, go downstairs.

16
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,593
Then I won't know
what you're taking.

17
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,310
Your own cousin ...
Would I steal from you?

18
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,150
Go downstairs, Gabriel.
We'll buy some more, then.

19
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,517
But aren't you going to
try on the garters?

20
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,032
Garters are not something
you try on. Now go downstairs.

21
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,835
My dear colleague, welcome.

22
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,510
My name is Wenzel Heyde.
I am the local pastor here in Torshavn.

23
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,036
Thank you. God bless you.
My name is Paul Aggersøe.

24
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,472
This is my cousin
Chief Alderman Samuel Mikkelsen.

25
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,878
Welcome to the Faroe lslands.
- Thank you and God bless you.

26
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,472
Let's get up to the parsonage.
You must be in need of refreshments.

27
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,634
It's always a major event,
when a ship arrives.

28
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,838
Everyone wants to see it.
- I can imagine.

29
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,313
Johan Hendrik Heyde, Judge.
Merely wishing to pay my respects.

30
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,516
Paul Aggersøe.
- This is my brother.

31
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,554
We're all related up here,
as you can hear.

32
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,398
Are you aware that your predecessor,
Pastor Niels, left a widow?

33
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,797
So I've been told.
Thank you.

34
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,470
But I have no plans for marriage.

35
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,591
What news do you bring us
from the world at large?

36
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,793
What of Madame de Pompadour?
Has she caused France new calamities?

37
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,315
One hears a lot about
her and King Louis ...

38
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,239
It's bad for morality when
royals lead the way in fornication.

39
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,359
What do you know of the Madame?
Or what goes on in France?

40
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,551
Or the french intellectual climate?

41
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,194
How can a climate be intellectual
which isn't rooted in Our Lord?

42
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,316
She is a brazen hussy.

43
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,439
Always dancing
and leading the men astray.

44
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,797
Isn't her having been married
to two pastors enough already?

45
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,748
I believe Aunt Armgard refers to
the widow in your parish ...

46
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,029
Yes, the Lord knows
I'm refering to Barbara.

47
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,108
And I know how both Pastor Jonas and
Pastor Niels came by their deaths.

48
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,718
No, Aunt. Barbara had no part
in Pastor Jonas' death.

49
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,596
And Pastor Niels fell off his horse,
which is surely pure mischance.

50
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,479
It was no mischance that she was
so unboundedly lecherous -

51
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,950
- that Pastor Niels didnt' dare
leave her at home alone -

52
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,476
- and therefore had to ride home
over the fells at dead of night.

53
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,750
My dear Aunt Armgard ...

54
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,388
You're always so hasty.

55
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,599
It's true that she often
neglected her husband.

56
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,956
Where there's a dance
you'll find Barabara.

57
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,310
But I believe, she did feel
some compassion for Pastor Niels.

58
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,034
She was just quick
to forget about it.

59
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,029
We came to hear if
the "Fortuna" brought any mail?

60
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,879
Mail?

61
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,037
I believe all the mail
is downstairs in the court-room.

62
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,595
We'll go downstairs then.

63
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,352
But ... Suzanne ...

64
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,356
I want you to meet
the new Pastor on Vágoy.

65
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,870
Stay for a cup of coffee,
now that you're here.

66
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,036
This is my daughter Suzanne.

67
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,232
Pastor Paul Aggersøe.

68
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,829
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

69
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,311
We've been looking forward
to your arrival.

70
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,835
How long are you staying
in Torshavn?

71
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,359
A few days at the most.

72
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,394
I'm only waiting to talk to
the Provost on his next visit.

73
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,830
He comes here now and again.

74
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,752
Here you are, Suzanne.

75
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,599
Do you take sugar?
- You know I don't.

76
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,718
What do you think of
the widow from your parish?

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,638
Who?

78
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,552
Barbara.

79
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,428
Is that Barbara?

80
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,873
She's the daughter of our last Judge.
My late predecessor.

81
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,311
Come sit here, Barbara,
so I can see you properly.

82
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,075
What a fine girl you are.

83
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,794
High cheekbones ...

84
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,155
... a high bust ...

85
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,233
... and delicate hands.

86
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,749
It's no wonder
the men are so fond of you.

87
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,556
Barbara, come meet
Vágoy's new Pastor.

88
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,317
This is Pastor Paul Aggersøe.

89
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,191
Barbara Christina Salling,
your predecessor's widow.

90
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,516
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

91
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,639
I live on the other side of the sands.
When the tide is out.

92
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,391
That is where the dower-house is?
- Yes.

93
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,990
When I'm home on the island.

94
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,875
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

95
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,513
Thank you.

96
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,356
Pastor Paul ...
Do you have a minute?

97
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,392
There is something
I want to show you.

98
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,591
I thought you might like
something to brace you up.

99
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,116
French brandy.

100
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,230
Aunt Armgard musn't see anything.

101
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,995
Maybe we could join company -

102
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,949
- when I go back to the farm
in a few days. If that would suit you?

103
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,670
Can I get you anything?

104
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,278
No thank you.
I'm just looking around.

105
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,511
I see.

106
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,717
Terrible weather.

107
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,994
Does it always rain this much
up here?

108
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,319
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>It grows like weed.</i>

109
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,639
<i>But that's because</i>
<i>the sods are turned so often.</i>

110
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,477
I don't understand your language.

111
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,950
<i>I don't know if</i>
<i>the Pastor understands ...</i>

112
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,480
<i>It can't be eaten.</i>

113
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,274
<i>It must be carted away.</i>
<i>It's no use at all.</i>

114
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,477
I'm sure you're right.
I feel a bit lonely, too.

115
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,591
Barbara, the new Pastor on Vágoy
is here to see you.

116
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
Good evening, Pastor Paul.
- Good evening.

117
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,756
I thought I'd visit
with you and your mother.

118
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,195
You're very welcome, Pastor.

119
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,431
Won't your mother ..?

120
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,638
She'd rather sit in the kitchen.
It's warmer out there.

121
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,475
Sit down, Pastor Paul.
- Thank you ...

122
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,196
I was just talking to my cousin -

123
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,710
- about all the goods
that came on the "Fortuna".

124
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,554
Yes ...
there was a lot on that ship.

125
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,510
Gabriel works at the Chandler's.
- I'm the manager of it.

126
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,118
I've been down there.

127
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,792
So I hear.
How much syrup did they bring?

128
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,752
Three barrels.

129
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,719
Is that a lot or a little?

130
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,953
It's not much for four months.

131
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,751
<i>That old hag, Vupsen,</i>
<i>came in to buy a cup of syrup.</i>

132
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,674
<i>I said it was the second time</i>
<i>she'd been in today.</i>

133
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,793
<i>Then she told me</i>
<i>there'd been a hole in her cup.</i>

134
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,434
I don't understand Faroese.

135
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,313
It was just something about
the Chandler's. Nothing important.

136
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,399
But it was amusing.

137
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,273
Which professors did you have
at the university?

138
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,315
Did you have professor Sidenius?
- Yes.

139
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,752
And professor Paludan, the one
who lithsps? "Luther's Catechithm".

140
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,033
Yes, I had him too.

141
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,635
Do you know him?

142
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,669
I've heard of them from Pastor Niels,
my late husband.

143
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,996
Ah, yes. Of course.

144
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,917
Did you know my late husband?
Did you know Pastor Niels?

145
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,554
No, I didn't know him.
He'd left when I started studying.

146
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,274
A great loss
that he should die so young.

147
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,229
Yes. It was very sad.

148
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,474
<i>Why are you trying to hide</i>
<i>what you're sewing?</i>

149
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,638
What was your graduation sermon about?
Was it a fine sermon?

150
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,553
It was about
the talents we're entrusted with.

151
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,397
And since you asked -

152
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,950
- everyone told me
they found my words very moving.

153
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,599
But ...

154
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,874
But all the glory belongs to Our Lord
who gave me His true inspiration.

155
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,679
<i>Do you think we can't see what</i>
<i>you're sewing? It's not very seemly.</i>

156
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,231
It is a pillow case.

157
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,557
<i>A pillow case?</i>
<i>Right down to your ankles?</i>

158
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,391
All right, it is a shift.

159
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,598
You're a fool, Gabriel.
Have you never seen a shift before?

160
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,595
<i>It looks like a bridal shift.</i>
<i>Who's going to take it off you?</i>

161
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,878
What did he say?

162
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,158
He said
it looks like a bridal shift ...

163
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,960
... and then something
I won't repeat.

164
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,476
I need to go down to the Chandler's
and tend to some things.

165
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,875
Goodbye, dear cousin.

166
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,473
Goodbye.

167
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,154
Pastor Paul ...

168
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,193
I think we can get my mother
to make us some coffee.

169
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,439
<i>Hoist the jib and foresail!</i>

170
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,792
She'll have the wind with her
on her way back.

171
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,837
Oh, it's you again.

172
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,719
Yes, I've cleared up
at the Chandler's.

173
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,429
I think the wind will stay
in the south-west -

174
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,188
- and the tide won't turn
for another hour.

175
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,835
She is a very charming woman ...
my predecessor's widow.

176
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,516
You should have known her
when she was eighteen and innocent.

177
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,836
She was sweet, then.

178
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,670
I can imagine that.

179
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,677
A pity she had to fall so low.

180
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,111
She's so full of tricks
when she meets a stranger.

181
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,591
Well, my impression of her
is very agreeable.

182
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,589
That's easy for you to say.
You're not related to her.

183
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,269
Us, she has only brought shame.

184
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,235
But I must warn you.
She is a lecherous one.

185
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,869
Especially with men of the cloth.

186
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,150
She's already been married
to two of them -

187
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,718
- and engaged to a third,
the Provost Anders Morsing.

188
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,118
Has she been engaged to the Provost?
- Yes.

189
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,759
Oh, you didn't know?
That was before Pastor Niels.

190
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,913
She's got a roving eye, she has.

191
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,109
Let me tell you this
once and for all.

192
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,270
When it comes to firm faith in God
and true devotion to Our Lord -

193
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,831
- we ministers can learn more
from these people -

194
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,833
- than the people can learn
from us.

195
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,636
What it comes down to
right now -

196
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,275
- as far as we ministers
are concerned -

197
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,109
- is showing ourselves
worthy of our vocation -

198
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,520
- and be deserving of
the unfathomable trust -

199
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,190
- which our parishioners
so manifestly have in us.

200
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,154
This we can only do -

201
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,914
- by upholding the law -

202
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,752
- and living a decent
and chaste life in Our Lord -

203
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,352
- and not letting ourselves
be led astray from His path.

204
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,389
It's as simple as that.

205
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,073
When are you leaving?

206
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,476
I've been invited to sail
with the Chief Alderman -

207
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,597
- when he returns to Vágoy.

208
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,360
Ah, yes, well ...

209
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,471
Not a word against Samuel Mikkelsen, -

210
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,518
- but he seldom saddles
and rides on the same day.

211
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,311
Provost Anders Morsing ...

212
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,958
... I thank you for your
most edifying words -

213
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,549
- which have chastened my heart.

214
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,949
I must admit
I have already come to learn -

215
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,835
- that here, too,
on the Faroe lslands, there are -

216
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,119
- circumstances which may lead
the unstable soul astray.

217
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,631
But your words have
strengthened me -

218
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,873
- and I shall do my utmost
to live up to your expectations.

219
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,471
lndeed.

220
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,599
Then I need say no more.

221
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,589
I can hear that you understand
what I mean.

222
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,476
It is true that there have been
a number of ...

223
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,793
... black sheep
among our colleagues.

224
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,519
Now you go to the service
and hear Pastor Wenzel's sermon.

225
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,990
That is,
if he is able to find the words.

226
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,153
I must make haste to
my own parish on Esturoy.

227
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,672
Since you're our latest arrival -

228
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,038
- we'll look forward to your sermon
on the next St. Olav's Day this summer.

229
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,554
<i>What is it but bubbles</i>
<i>and vessels so weak?</i>

230
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:59,518
<i>What is it but thin ice</i>
<i>and filth and decay</i>

231
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,999
<i>on vanity's way</i>
<i>on vanity's way?</i>

232
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,512
<i>And thou, carnal lust,</i>

233
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:24,998
<i>so many thou temptest</i>
<i>thy warm lips to kiss.</i>

234
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:33,591
<i>Thy flame-kindling tinder,</i>
<i>thy sparks that ignite</i>

235
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:42,196
<i>consume all too many</i>
<i>in Hell's endless night.</i>

236
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,154
<i>Thy promise is honey,</i>
<i>but after-taste gall -</i>

237
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,231
<i>'Tis vanity, all.</i>

238
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,075
<i>Pirates! Pirates!</i>

239
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,552
What's happening?

240
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,716
The pirates are coming!

241
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,514
Two ...

242
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,590
No, there's three.
At this time of year it must be pirates.

243
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,989
Good Lord.

244
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,675
Can they really be pirates
this far north?

245
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,353
Easily. Especially the turks.

246
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,194
The steal our women and children
and make them slaves.

247
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,430
Oh Lord Jesus,
have mercy on us ...

248
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,072
Sound the drum!
Get up at the Fort!

249
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,635
You cowards!
Put your uniforms on!

250
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,950
<i>Jesus Maria!</i>

251
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,589
My legs are not so strong.
I think I'll stay here.

252
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,232
But you can go and hide,
if you like.

253
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,476
No, I think we'll stay.

254
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,393
If they turn out to be friendly -

255
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,950
- it would be a shame
if they found the town empty.

256
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,231
Ships that size
can't be pirate ships.

257
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,676
They must be men-of-war.

258
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,639
Can you see any flags?
- I can.

259
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,873
They're white with something ...

260
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,158
White with something gold?
- Yes.

261
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,120
With some gold squiggles on them.

262
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,238
Then they can't be pirates.
It must be the French.

263
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,876
Are we at war with them?
- No.

264
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,674
They'll behave themselves.

265
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,394
Take it easy, Gabriel.
They're not pirates.

266
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,838
They aren't? What are they then?
- We believe they're Frenchmen.

267
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,754
Frenchmen? What do they want?

268
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,830
Oh, how fat you are, Gabriel.
What's that in your trousers?

269
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,435
Don't do that!
- And under your jacket?

270
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,229
It's my duty to save
as much as possible.

271
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,639
<i>So we need a harbour</i>
<i>in order to repair the damage.</i>

272
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,833
<i>And we need some water.</i>
<i>Can you supply us with water?</i>

273
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,588
<i>We can offer you</i>
<i>some wine in exchange.</i>

274
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,600
This is Captain Montgaillard.

275
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,916
They're returning from
the war in America -

276
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,277
- and a storm has driven them north
and they're in need of water.

277
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,670
They're asking
if we have any water.

278
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,078
Why, we have lots of water.

279
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,195
They say they will trade
wine for water.

280
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,593
Wine for water?
It sounds just like the Bible.

281
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,510
They can have as much water
as they have barrels for.

282
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,998
<i>You can have as much as you like,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

283
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,278
<i>We shall repay your kindness.</i>

284
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,237
<i>We do have another request.</i>

285
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,348
<i>Would you permit our officers</i>
<i>to go ashore -</i>

286
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,069
<i>- if only for a dance?</i>

287
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,998
What did he say?

288
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,630
<i>We've been at sea for a long time.</i>

289
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,994
<i>To live without beauty,</i>
<i>without female company -</i>

290
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,470
<i>- is difficult.</i>

291
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,639
<i>Would there be any ladies</i>
<i>on your islands -</i>

292
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,435
<i>- who might give our officers</i>
<i>the pleasure of a dance?</i>

293
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,951
<i>If my request can be met,</i>
<i>we'll bring the orchestra ourselves.</i>

294
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,395
<i>Please accept.</i>
<i>It would give us great pleasure.</i>

295
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,274
The admiral says
they've been at sea for a long time, -

296
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,672
- and asks if there are
any girls here on the islands -

297
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,996
- and if his officers -

298
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,829
- could come ashore and dance.

299
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,399
If we accept,
it would be a great pleasure to him.

300
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,839
<i>Oui, oui.</i>
Very lovely girls.

301
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,311
Very, very lovely.

302
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,232
<i>My dear friend ...</i>

303
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,353
<i>Today is a grand day, -</i>

304
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,678
<i>- for the sea has brought us together</i>
<i>to sign a treaty of friendship -</i>

305
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,520
<i>- which will enable us</i>
<i>to fight together -</i>

306
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,595
<i>- against the falsehood</i>
<i>and felonies of the English.</i>

307
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,148
<i>Lieutenant, may l?</i>

308
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,238
Now Barbara's dancing
with the next one.

309
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,758
It'll be interesting to see
who finally wins the day.

310
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,436
Don't you think it needs sugar?

311
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,870
Is it too sour for you, Alderman?

312
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,675
<i>Good evening, gentlemen.</i>

313
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,392
Cousin,
come trade wine for water.

314
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,916
<i>Mademoiselle,</i>
<i>another german dance?</i>

315
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,273
Get a good look at her tonight.
You'll learn a lot from that.

316
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,752
Pastor Paul,
a cup of consolation?

317
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,519
Thank you.

318
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,913
To think that I could fall for that.

319
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,111
She's nothing.

320
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,637
In Copenhagen she wouldn't be
anything at all.

321
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,913
It's only up here, where
she's surrounded by common folk.

322
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,669
Why don't we go outside for a bit?
It's so hot in here.

323
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,953
Why, of course ...
But, where?

324
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,277
Just down to the crane
to look at the ships.

325
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,551
I'd love to.

326
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,555
That bitch! Did you see that?
She has no shame.

327
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,195
First the admiral
and now the pastor.

328
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,228
You don't seem to be
enjoying yourself, Pastor.

329
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,078
No ...

330
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,675
But the Frenchmen seem to be
enjoying themselves well enough.

331
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,518
Yes ...

332
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,832
But tomorrow they'll be gone.
Isn't that right?

333
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,993
Isn't it?

334
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,998
Yes.

335
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,199
We've never had such big ships
here before.

336
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,590
I wonder what life they lead?

337
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,751
That of Catholics ...

338
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,069
Actually, I'd like to go home now,
if you would be so kind as to escort me.

339
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,313
There's nothing I'd rather do.
I must say, -

340
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,519
- it's not the kind of party
I enjoy.

341
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,796
Careful.
It's rather muddy.

342
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,350
Let me give you a hand.

343
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,270
I thought I might go
with you and the Alderman -

344
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,909
- when you return to Vágoy.

345
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,511
That would be a great pleasure.

346
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,671
Thank you for lending me your jacket,
and for escorting me home.

347
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,154
Goodnight.

348
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,159
Goodnight,
and thank you for this evening.

349
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,476
<i>Barbara, how nice to see you again.</i>

350
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,717
<i>Le nez.</i>

351
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,511
<i>Noes.</i>

352
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,439
<i>The little foot ...</i>

353
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,951
<i>... and the little shoe.</i>

354
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,311
Get up those stairs, Gabriel!

355
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,551
You peeping tom!
You should be ashamed!

356
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,997
No.
It's my responsibility.

357
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,754
The storage cellar.
I just have to ...

358
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,592
No, you don't!
Go upstairs!

359
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,988
I'll be damned if I ever worry
about Barbara again.

360
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,869
I don't care if anything respectable
can ever come of her.

361
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,549
You should see
what's going on downstairs.

362
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,070
Every married man will be made
a cuckold tonight.

363
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,278
For once
it's nice not to be married.

364
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,471
Thank God we're not married.

365
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,075
Just think of the horns
they'll be getting tonight.

366
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,469
But that's not worth looking at.

367
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,389
If that new Vágoy pastor thinks
he knows anything ...

368
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,717
He's a prize fool he is.

369
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,797
It may well be that, -

370
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,117
- in the eyes of Our Lord, -

371
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,557
- I am a contemptible cuckold.

372
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,438
But you're not married.

373
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,714
Even so, I can still be a cuckold.
In my heart.

374
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,638
If you look at it that way,
then I'm a cuckold, too.

375
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,276
<i>And thou carnal lust</i> ...

376
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,916
<i>You cannot lie with her.</i>
<i>She has a disease.</i>

377
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,877
<i>French dogs!</i>

378
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,950
<i>The quarterboat is coming!</i>

379
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,711
<i>The Alderman is there!</i>

380
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,479
Welcome , Alderman.
- Thank you.

381
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,230
Could I perhaps borrow a horse?
My legs are not so strong.

382
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,391
Of course you can.

383
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,319
And Barbara and the Pastor, too,
if they like.

384
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,511
Would you like a horse, Barbara?

385
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,314
No, I'd rather not sit and freeze.
I prefer walking.

386
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,318
What about the Pastor?

387
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,438
No, thank you,
I prefer walking as well.

388
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,677
I suppose you don't jump across
the water in Copenhagen?

389
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,310
No, where there's water,
we have bridges.

390
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,553
I'd love to walk around in
Copenhagen one day.

391
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,395
Where would I go?

392
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,955
Gentleladies don't walk at all.

393
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,199
They arrive in sedan chairs
or coaches pulled by horses.

394
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,556
What clothing should one wear?

395
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,868
One should wear crinoline or
a stiff underskirt made from whalebone.

396
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,396
Whalebone?

397
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,553
Suzanne says,
you have to wear corsets ...

398
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,798
... and when you faint
they undo them for you.

399
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,914
And have you been to balls, too?

400
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,789
Yes, several times.
And to masquerades.

401
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,196
Where you don't know who's who?

402
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,235
No, not before you take
your mask off.

403
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,911
That must be exciting.
What does your fiancée say then?

404
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,077
When I take my mask off?

405
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,158
Yes.

406
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,635
I have no fiancée.

407
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,230
I did have a very dear friend,
but I left her behind.

408
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,516
I feel sad for her.

409
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,075
I was left behind, too, once.

410
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,278
When Jonas, my first husband, died.

411
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,873
They say
the wind makes you beautiful.

412
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,430
Good evening
and God bless this house.

413
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,712
In the name of God ...

414
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,593
Is the Alderman out travelling
in this weather?

415
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,549
Yes, I'm one of four.
I have Vágoy's new pastor with me.

416
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,712
Come inside, and get yourselves
dry and warm.

417
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,957
I'm not that wet.

418
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,988
And the only man I can share clothes
with lives up on Svanoy.

419
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,196
<i>Janus, go fetch some turf.</i>

420
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,359
<i>You're so wet.</i>
<i>It's good to get some dry clothes on.</i>

421
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,431
<i>Take it all off quickly.</i>

422
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,869
<i>But we only have peasant clothes.</i>
<i>- That'll be fine.</i>

423
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,513
<i>She's so wet.</i>

424
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,155
<i>It's not that cold. Only wet.</i>

425
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,995
<i>When you've taken the clothes off,</i>
<i>go hang them up outside.</i>

426
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,632
<i>It's nice to put something dry</i>
<i>on your body.</i>

427
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,355
<i>Are you cold?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

428
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,111
<i>I'm warm now.</i>

429
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,076
If nobody minds,
I think I'll go lie down.

430
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,198
Where do you want to put me?

431
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,592
<i>Perhaps the Alderman wouldn't mind</i>
<i>sharing the alcove with the Pastor?</i>

432
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,360
<i>We can sleep in the kitchen.</i>

433
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,757
He comes upon a green mound
and the mound is open, -

434
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,516
- and an old witch
invites him inside.

435
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,953
Another witch offers him
beer in a silver chalice.

436
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,756
But Rasmus Ganting blew the froth
right in the witch's face.

437
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,713
And the Pastor says ...

438
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,470
"If I were no wiser than you" -

439
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,070
- "I would never have found my way
into this mound."

440
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,872
For Jesus means -

441
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,077
- a change in our lives.

442
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,109
It is in him we find consolation
and encouragement.

443
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,916
He must be a fixed point
in our lives.

444
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,875
We must devote ourselves
to the Faith -

445
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,238
- and forsake all our dependence
on worldly goods.

446
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,431
Everything has been given to us ...

447
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,110
Everything has been given to us,
and it's up to us to -

448
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,039
- administer this gift
with a righteous spirit.

449
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,357
As it is written in the Gospel
according to St. Matthew ...

450
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,108
"Lay not up for yourselves
treasures upon earth", -

451
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,311
- "where moth and dust doth corrupt."

452
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,433
"Lay up for yourselves
treasures in Heaven."

453
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,550
Elias Jogvansen ...

454
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,031
I hear you are very ill.

455
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,959
I have come to talk to you
about Jesus -

456
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,675
- and the eternal life.

457
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,796
Elias Jogvansen ...

458
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,874
Do you believe in
the foregiveness of sins -

459
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,913
- and in the eternal life
of Our Lord Jesus Christ?

460
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,875
Yes ...

461
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,357
My father has always lived
the life of a good Christian.

462
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,794
Depart in the name of the Lord.

463
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,715
<i>Almighty God ...</i>

464
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,548
<i>You can see deep within me -</i>

465
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,480
<i>- and know the turmoil in my soul.</i>

466
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,200
You know, that I'm being led
into temptation -

467
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,113
- and fighting in vain
against myself -

468
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,352
- and trying to
exorcise the evil spirit.

469
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,670
You know, that my heart is not in it
when I preach the glory of thy kingdom.

470
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,993
Or when I visit the sick
in my parish -

471
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,158
- or console those
in need of consolation.

472
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,356
For every day ...

473
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,194
... when the tide goes out ...

474
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,034
... she comes to me.

475
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,475
And I want it to be that way ...

476
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,877
.. for my heart is in great turmoil.

477
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,512
My life no longer consist
of days and nights ...

478
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,315
... but of high and low tides.

479
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,793
And when I read "Faith's Precious Gem"
to find Christian words for my sermons -

480
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,629
- I find only condemnation
of my own life.

481
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,874
Heavenly father, I know
it's blasphemous to say, but ...

482
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,714
.. I'm looking for the slightest word
to show me -

483
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,748
- that you find some small pleasure
in my feelings for my dearest love.

484
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,476
For we do love each other.
Deeply and sincerely.

485
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,674
Come outside.
The sun is shining.

486
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,200
It's called "solya".
Isn't it beautiful?

487
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,959
It means "eye of the sun".

488
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,636
Here.
Don't you want my flower?

489
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,393
I've picked it for you,
my dearest.

490
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,959
Aren't you happy to see me?
I came because the tide was out.

491
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,952
It goes out every day.
- Yes, thank God for that.

492
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,635
Are you sad, my love?

493
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,151
Yes.

494
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,998
It's as though I stretch out
my whole hand to you, -

495
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,272
- but to me you only
stretch out your little finger.

496
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,148
How can you say that?

497
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,475
You don't stretch out your whole hand,
because you can't.

498
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,636
I give you everything
I have to give.

499
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,995
You know I'm trying to attend
to my work, to write good sermons.

500
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,149
Can't I help you?
With your sermons?

501
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,192
I can write,
if you dictate them to me.

502
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,358
Can't you understand I have to
be a part of everything you do?

503
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,037
Let's try it straight away.
You read from the Bible and I'll write.

504
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,232
Everything you say.
Word for word.

505
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,356
Here.
There's something about Jesus.

506
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,758
Dictate to me now.

507
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,996
"And Jesus spoke
and said unto him:"

508
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,915
"Simon, I have something
to tell you."

509
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,560
"And Jesus spoke ..."

510
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,589
"... and said unto him:"

511
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,913
"Simon, I have something
to tell you."

512
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,517
"Hjesus"?

513
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,679
You spell Jesus with an H?
Can't you even spell "Jesus"?

514
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,157
Don't be angry with me.
- Get away, you ..!

515
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,079
It's not of <i>me</i>
you must ask foregiveness.

516
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,755
Of course ...

517
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,114
I was terribly stupid.

518
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,628
I'm not worthy of such work.

519
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,954
I'm a sinful woman.

520
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,516
Are you a very sinful woman?

521
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,632
Yes.

522
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,796
Barbara ...

523
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,309
Will you listen to something?

524
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,797
The text I read from -

525
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,679
- is where the sinful woman
comes to Jesus -

526
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,117
- while he's dining with
the Pharisee, Simon.

527
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,355
Simon didn't find her worthy of
anointing Jesus' feet.

528
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,673
But then Jesus tells him the parable
of the creditor who had two debtors.

529
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,835
One who owes him 500 dinars,
and one who owes him 50 dinars.

530
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,038
And he forgives them both
their debts.

531
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,119
Now which of them
would love him the most?

532
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,553
The one who owed him 500?

533
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,352
Yes.

534
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,072
And he turned to the woman
and said unto Simon:

535
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,910
"Seest thou this woman?"

536
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,119
"I entered into thine house.
Thou gavest me no water for my feet."

537
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,797
"But she hath washed my feet with tears
and wiped them with her hair."

538
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,310
"Thou gavest me no kiss," -

539
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,956
- "but she has not ceased
to kiss my feet."

540
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:09,115
"My head with oil thou didst not anoint,
but she anointed my feet with ointment."

541
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,839
"Therefore I say unto thee:"

542
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,718
"Her many sins are foregiven,
for she loved much."

543
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,838
"But he whom little is forgiven" -

544
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,638
- "the same loveth little."

545
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,076
And he said unto her:

546
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,068
"Thy sins are foregiven."

547
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,112
Oh, Paul ...

548
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,798
I'm so terribly ashamed.

549
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,835
I never thought God would
find me again.

550
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,788
Oh, thank you ...

551
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,116
My dearest.

552
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,153
I'm not the one you should be thanking.
God is.

553
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,271
Barbara ...

554
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,995
I'm going outside now,
so you can have the room to yourself -

555
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,078
- and thank God for his words.

556
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,276
Have you already thanked God?
- Yes.

557
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:37,152
I've thanked him for everything.
And now I must thank you, too.

558
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,719
And you know what?

559
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,554
When the sun is shining
one mustn't sit indoors -

560
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,115
- and let God's gifts
go to waste.

561
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,909
Oh, Barbara ...
You're like a child.

562
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,917
But you're a sinner, too,
aren't you?

563
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:59,114
Even though I'm the greatest sinner.
But Jesus is my friend.

564
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,512
<i>The bailiff's sad -</i>
<i>a worried man.</i>

565
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:31,392
<i>We'll solve Suzanne's problems</i>
<i>if we can.</i>

566
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,278
<i>Stop that song,</i>
<i>or I'll have you locked in the dungeon!</i>

567
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,918
<i>We can solve it, if he'll hark.</i>

568
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:57,436
<i>We'll get Gabriel,</i>
<i>the Chandler's clerk.</i>

569
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,638
<i>Suzanne's French kid's father</i>
<i>is far away.</i>

570
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,919
<i>So Gabriel dad's clerk will be</i>

571
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:17,396
<i>and work for Bailie</i>
<i>on their wedding day.</i>

572
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,520
Oh no, it can't be true.

573
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,151
What's the matter?
Are you ill?

574
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,152
No ...

575
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,997
Suzanne's with child ...
a frenchman's child.

576
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,798
And so they're marrying her
to Gabriel.

577
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,239
Is she being married to Gabriel because
she is carrying a Frenchman's child?

578
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,196
I don't understand this.

579
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,349
How do you know this?
- That's what the men are singing.

580
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,796
Gabriel is now working
for Suzanne's father.

581
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,036
That's what they're singing.

582
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,035
That <i>I</i> was pregnant?
It's not true.

583
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,912
See for yourself.
- What do I know?

584
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,318
There are so many rumors.

585
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,314
They say, that's why you are
in such a hurry to get married.

586
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,359
The cheek of it.
Did Gabriel start all this?

587
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,788
It'd be just like him.

588
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,640
It's quite a scandal.

589
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,799
Seven women are pregnant
with french bastards.

590
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:27,631
What does the Pastor think of all this?
- It's very disturbing.

591
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,031
Is Suzanne at home?
- Yes.

592
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,677
She's hardly out dancing
with that sinful belly of hers.

593
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,790
I'll just run down there.
- Aren't you going to eat?

594
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,274
Well ... she's off again.

595
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,235
Mistress Salling ...

596
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,558
I, too, feel angry about the rumors
there may be about your daughter.

597
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,318
Perhaps I have my own reasons
for that.

598
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,708
For it's true that I hope
to call you mother-in-law soon.

599
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,589
So I hear.
I hope something good comes of it.

600
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,598
Let me put it bluntly, Pastor Paul.

601
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,997
I know my daughter
and I know how fickle she is.

602
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,312
I've brought her up
to the best of my ability -

603
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,518
- but now I wash my hands of her.

604
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,758
And who would conduct the ceremony?

605
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,310
The Provost, her former fiancée?

606
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,717
Or the Pastor in Torshavn,
Pastor Wenzel, -

607
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,919
- who's already married her to two men
and laid them both in their graves?

608
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,912
He must be getting tired of
doing that job for her.

609
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,748
Silk ... with golden thread.

610
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,031
A gold button.

611
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,552
And a ribbon.

612
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,228
Do you remember the ribbons
they tied their hair up with?

613
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,115
I don't even know his name.

614
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,828
When I smell it,
I can see him in front of me.

615
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,996
Smell it.
Do you remember the smell?

616
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:22,155
He was so courteous.
Not a stick-in-the-mud like Gabriel.

617
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,669
Couldn't you have found
someone better?

618
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,795
What about the Judge, Johan Hendrik?

619
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,238
He probably wouldn't mind
having you.

620
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,678
Anything would have been better
than Gabriel.

621
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,515
I want to arrest the trouble-makers.
The people are getting out of hand.

622
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,076
I think it would help to let them
cool off in the dungeon.

623
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,633
I won't do any good, Gabriel.

624
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,232
Take my advice
and do nothing about it.

625
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,592
Otherwise we'll end up
putting everyone in the dungeon.

626
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,515
They're singing satirical songs
and mocking the authorities.

627
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,752
It'll blow over.
- But they're singing about me, -

628
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,992
- and the damn liberties
Suzanne took.

629
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,712
Hello, Gabriel.

630
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,310
Come, let me see
how dashing you've become.

631
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,473
With a wig and all.
- Hello, Barbara.

632
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,428
So you've come for St. Olav's Day, too.
- Yes.

633
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,119
And you're marrying Suzanne.
Then she and I'll be related.

634
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:41,799
You're getting married, too, I hear.
You get away with everything.

635
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,830
What do you mean?
- I can see that.

636
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,238
You're not like Suzanne.

637
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,750
You're a fool, Gabriel.
But you are my cousin.

638
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,591
Goodbye, Suzanne.
I'll see you again soon.

639
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,359
Goodbye, Gabriel,
and congratulations.

640
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,632
You didn't say where you were going.
I couldn't understand where you were.

641
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,559
Join in.
You only have to sing the chorus.

642
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,998
Barbara ...
I have a sermon tomorrow.

643
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,955
And as for all the Aldermen
who are assembled here today -

644
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,589
- I would commend to their
rememberance -

645
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,474
- that while everything lies
in the hands of God -

646
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,957
- it is nevertheless through
the decisions that we make -

647
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,118
- that his glorious work
is achieved.

648
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,758
The spirit of Our Lord must therefore
inform the laws we make.

649
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,436
We all remember how Jesus and
his disciples went out in a boat.

650
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,029
While he slept in the stern -

651
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,996
- a whirlwind arose
which drove waves over the boat, -

652
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,912
- so it filled with water.

653
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,510
Hello, Johan Hendrik.

654
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,074
Hello, Barbara.

655
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,916
When you look like that
we all know what it means.

656
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,799
Is he very much in love with you?
- Yes, he is.

657
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,158
Which is more than can be said
about Suzanne.

658
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,315
That Gabriel.
It's a shame.

659
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,480
How come you never thought
to marry her?

660
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,876
What kind of husband would I make?

661
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,074
I once dreamt you were married.

662
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,752
To Suzanne?
- No.

663
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,189
To me.

664
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,752
Are you sure I can bear
to hear such things?

665
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,359
I think Suzanne would be happier
with you than with Gabriel.

666
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,070
The Alderman told me the same earlier.
Hvae you two been planning this?

667
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,313
No, not at all. It just
occurred to me when I saw you, -

668
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,870
- so I thought I might as well
propose to you at once.

669
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,638
Won't you do it?

670
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,155
Well, I've always had
a soft spot for Suzanne.

671
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,200
I could consider it ...

672
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,952
But then you and l
wouldn't get to be a couple.

673
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,235
One can't have everything,
can one?

674
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,710
But you can have Suzanne.

675
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,390
I'll think about it.
- Please do.

676
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,432
Goodbye, Johan Hendrik.

677
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,317
Are you absolutely certain -

678
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,235
- that this woman you're marrying
take her promises just as seriously -

679
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,351
- as you do yours?

680
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:42,148
I know Barbara is very, very serious.

681
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,276
I also know
that she is a weak vessel.

682
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,757
But I suppose it's permissible
to put a little faith in God?

683
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,594
Now listen ...

684
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,639
Our Lord will not have any part
in this damnable game you play -

685
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,559
- with yourself and your vocation
in a marriage, which ...

686
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,234
Are you out of your mind?

687
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,908
I know it's hazardous.

688
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:21,429
I know as well as anyone
that Barbara is a sinful woman.

689
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,189
Certainly.

690
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,750
But the Lord did not consider Himself
too good to associate with sinners.

691
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,594
But he damn well didn't marry one.

692
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,873
No, he didn't marry anyone ...

693
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,958
... and therefore he became
the bridegroom of all sinners.

694
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,430
And since that is ...

695
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,752
... we mortals should not
consider ourselves too good.

696
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,075
I merely mean -

697
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,869
- that one must be on guard
against self-righteousness.

698
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,957
So it is perhaps
because of her sins ...

699
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,071
... that you are marrying her?

700
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,997
I pray to God that
this will prove to be a blessing.

701
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,590
And yet it isn't a ...

702
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:10,397
... purely spiritual marriage
that you're contemplating?

703
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,038
No, God knows we both are
sinful mortals.

704
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,674
But all lies in the hands of God.
- Like Hell it isn't!

705
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,032
"Thou shalt not tempt
the Lord thy God."

706
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,155
Is this young man
tempting God?

707
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,556
Isn't it rather himself
who's being tempted?

708
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,079
Isn't it time for
a cup of chocolate?

709
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,914
No, no, no, wait a minute.

710
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:38,113
This is a pastoral convention.
If the ladies would excuse us a moment.

711
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,718
Thank you ...
We still have a lot to discuss.

712
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:49,150
So the Provost didn't say anything?
- No ...

713
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,715
But we had some chocolate ...

714
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,151
... which Anna Sophia made.

715
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,554
What are we doing here?
- Sit down.

716
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,475
I used to hide here as a cild,
playing with Gabriel.

717
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,309
We can't sit here.
I'm a minister, remember?

718
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,110
But nobody can see us.
It's a hiding place.

719
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,555
What did you want to tell me?

720
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,231
Do you know what I've done today?
I've proposed to a man.

721
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,511
Proposed?

722
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,757
But to whom?

723
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:36,075
To Johan Hendrik, the Judge.
He said yes.

724
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,469
I don't understand ...

725
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:46,915
Oh, Paul ...
Stop looking like that.

726
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,749
Do you believe what I've said?
- Yes ...

727
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,548
No, of course not ...

728
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,914
I was just shocked.

729
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,909
I didn't propose on my own behalf.
I proposed for Suzanne.

730
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,958
And he said yes?
- Yes ...

731
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,949
Perhaps. But ...

732
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:14,430
He wanted to think it over,
because he would rather have me.

733
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,911
I see ...

734
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,598
Fool, fool, fool.

735
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,478
Hello, Gabriel.
Remember our old hiding place?

736
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,195
Taste it. It's edible.

737
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,599
Do you want some?

738
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,719
Angelica!
That's a corpse plant.

739
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,639
You can catch leprosy from it.
- Nonsense.

740
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:03,869
There was a plague cemetery here once.
The ground is full of lepers.

741
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,471
Gabriel ...
Are you happy that you're to be married?

742
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,476
Well ...
What is there to be happy about?

743
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,638
Suzanne, for instance.

744
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,555
And should I be happy about the child?
You can think again.

745
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,670
Well, Gabriel,
why don't you give it up?

746
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,276
Give it up?
Why should l?

747
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:35,315
If it's not necessary.
- God knows it's necessary.

748
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,594
What are you talking about?
- You can get out if you want to.

749
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,512
Who the devil say I don't want to?
Who says I can get out?

750
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:52,274
Nobody's saying that yet.
But the Judge might marry Suzanne, -

751
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,073
- if she'll have him.

752
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,590
The Alderman and l
have both talked to him about it.

753
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,310
You've been acting on my behalf?
Without my consent?

754
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:06,076
The devil take you, Barbara!
Thank's for being so officious.

755
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,914
I'll never forget this ill service
you've done me!

756
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,910
Good Lord, a butterfly.

757
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,273
<i>Out of my way.</i>

758
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,393
You're not disturbing me at all.

759
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,112
I was just playing my 'cello.
It's my favorite diversion.

760
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,317
Do sit down.

761
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:38,312
I've come in a rather unusual errand.
Barbara has asked me to talk to you.

762
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,953
Oh, <i>that</i> errand.

763
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,836
Tell Barabara that
she was kind to think of me ...

764
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:52,035
... but I don't think
that alliance would be a happy one.

765
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:56,037
But <i>you</i> shouldn't hesitate.

766
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:00,154
I know you've had a ticking-off
from the Provost today, -

767
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,318
- so that my brother hardly dares
marry you.

768
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,829
But we'll talk him round to it.

769
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,550
He can scarcely refuse you
God's blessing.

770
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,671
You're the first person not to tell me
my undertaking is pure folly.

771
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,996
Folly it certainly is.

772
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:23,473
But "he who never does anything foolish
is not as wise as he thinks."

773
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,075
I didn't think that up.
I'm not that clever.

774
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,989
It was La Rochefoucauld,
a French philosopher.

775
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:36,717
So, for me, you would recommend
what you yourself call folly?

776
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,520
Yes. Take the plunge.

777
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,598
He who makes no mistakes
does not live at all.

778
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,276
I admire you.
And I envy you.

779
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:55,240
It's a hazardous game you play, but l
envy you the experiences you'll make.

780
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,391
And if I lose the game?

781
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:04,359
Then I'll have all the more reason
to envy you. If you survive, that is.

782
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,950
I'm only joking.
Of course you'll survive.

783
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,829
You want me to live life to the fullest,
while you yourself would rather not?

784
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:18,750
No, I'm much too rational.

785
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:25,191
And reason obstructs
the acquisition of wisdom.

786
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,393
I'm consumed with curiosity
of knowing about mankind -

787
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,474
- and I've read tonnes of books,
but am I any wiser for that?

788
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,355
Books are like ...

789
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,709
... a pile of charts of the waters
we call human existence.

790
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,675
I stare at them blindly,
and then you come along -

791
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,714
- hoisting your sails
and setting straight out to sea.

792
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,436
Towards my own shipwreck,
you say.

793
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,752
A philosopher never capsizes
completely.

794
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,032
What I'm saying is:
sail as a philosopher -

795
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,957
- and take moral notes everywhere.

796
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,714
And register the winds of folly
every day.

797
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:18,150
As a man of God I cannot accept
that folly should lead to wisdom.

798
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:24,271
Before salvation must come sin.
Original sin, in any case.

799
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,914
That's certainly true.

800
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,999
And therefore we must thank God
for His infinite Grace.

801
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,273
Grace?
It's only a sprinkling of perfume, -

802
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,798
- when the stench of sin's sweaty feet
becomes too strong for us.

803
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:44,436
And wilt thou live with her
for better or for worse, -

804
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,911
- in such blessednesss as
God may bestow upon you, -

805
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,390
- as an honourable man should live
with his wedded wife?

806
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,318
I do.

807
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,110
Likewise I do ask thee,
Barbara Christina Salling, -

808
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,469
- wilt thou take Paul Aggersøe
to be thy wedded husband?

809
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,353
I do.

810
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,309
And wilt thou live with him
for better or for worse, -

811
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,188
- in such blessedness as
God may bestow upon you -

812
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,199
- as an honourable woman should live
with her wedded husband?

813
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,639
I do.

814
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,714
Then take each other's hands.

815
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:33,756
Since you have consented together
and exchanged your wedding vows ...

816
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,317
What is it, my love?
Are you sad?

817
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,432
I didn't know you painted your faces
so much up here.

818
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,550
<i>A ship has arrived!</i>

819
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,392
A ship's just come in.
It must be the "Fortuna".

820
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,557
See you later.

821
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:51,159
Squire Mikkelsen ...
can I count on your leaving today?

822
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,189
When the ship's just come in?
No. But tomorrow, perhaps.

823
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,073
<i>Andreas!</i>

824
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,110
Is it Andreas?
What's the meaning of this?

825
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,399
It was not intended that
he should be back so soon.

826
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:24,908
Did you know about this?
- Not at all. He can't be serious.

827
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,870
He's wearing a wig?
- Yes, he's handsome.

828
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,469
Well ...
I bet, you didn't expect this.

829
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,517
No, we didn't.

830
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,474
You uncle and I never thought you'd
come home in the midst of your studies.

831
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,316
Neither did I.

832
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:58,197
"We, Frederick the Fifth,
King of Denmark and Norway" -

833
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:04,276
- "do appoint student Andreas Heyde
to journey to the Faroe lslands" -

834
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:11,033
- "there to compile a report on the
nature, people and wealth of the land."

835
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:16,599
"Frederick Rex".
I'm getting paid to visit my uncles.

836
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,756
Well, I'll be blowed.

837
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:21,669
"A report on the nature, people
and wealth of the land."

838
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,475
Can you do that?
- Of course I can.

839
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:30,396
It'll be dificult.
But it's a marvellous assignment.

840
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:37,156
Welcome, Andreas.
- Thank you, dear Uncle.

841
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,869
How did you get this assignment?

842
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,510
Take care.
The things in the chest are fragile.

843
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,233
Welcome home, Andreas.
- My dear Aunt!

844
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,716
Congratulations on
your assignment.

845
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,354
It's wonderful.

846
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,030
And how you've grown.
You're a grown up man, now.

847
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,273
And your clothes are so fine.
Will it please you to stay with us?

848
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,473
Unless you have other plans.
- Thank you.

849
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,196
I'd like that very much.
At least, until I find other lodgings.

850
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:19,996
I suppose you know ..?
- Yes, from school. I know ...

851
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,676
... Mistress Salling.
- Mistress Aggersøe.

852
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,469
Barbara has just remarried.

853
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,077
I remember you from school, too.
I remember you well.

854
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,716
Come home with us then
and celebrate Andreas' return.

855
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:35,710
Thank you.

856
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:47,678
I don't think we'll be leaving today.
- Neither do l. Maybe tomorrow.

857
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,797
Perhaps it's not that important?

858
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,188
It must be this one. Yes.

859
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,951
Here you are, Uncle.
A little present.

860
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,151
Francois Quesnay.

861
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,955
He belongs to a new school of
economics called the Physiocrats.

862
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,959
They say agriculture is
the source of real wealth.

863
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,430
We just need to cultivate
the soil properly.

864
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,354
Very interesting.
- Yes, isn't it?

865
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,670
I've read it several times.

866
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,709
<i>A poor peasant means</i>
<i>a poor kingdom.</i>

867
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,156
Please forgive my taking
such liberties.

868
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,716
It's hard to discard
undergraduate habits.

869
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,634
What have we here?

870
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,639
Volà!

871
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,070
Here you are, dear Aunt
A present for you.

872
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,472
Thank you, Andreas.

873
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,677
Like this.
It'll give you fresh air.

874
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,595
It's the height of fashion
in Copenhagen.

875
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,915
I think I have something for
Mistress Aggersøe, too.

876
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,872
There you are.
- Thank you.

877
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,232
It's a rose.

878
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,479
How lovely.

879
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,433
And it has a fragrance, too.
- Of course.

880
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,633
And who was it really meant for?

881
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,755
Now, that's my secret.

882
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,991
So you have a musical instrument?
- Oh yes.

883
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,357
But I only use it
when I sing for myself

884
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,956
Do you sing too?
- Only little ditties.

885
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,994
Won't you sing for us, Andreas?
- Yes, sing for us.

886
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,795
Shall l?
They're only little ditties.

887
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,710
It's not something
I perform publicly.

888
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,156
<i>My heart is aching,</i>
<i>sadly I'm making</i>

889
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,796
<i>strings on my fiddle weep.</i>
<i>Pling plang!</i>

890
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:19,396
<i>Candles are dying</i>
<i>wine glasses drying</i>

891
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,355
<i>I've no place to fall asleep.</i>
<i>Kling klang!</i>

892
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:31,314
<i>Cold and draughty night is flying.</i>
<i>There lies my drunken brother dying.</i>

893
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:35,030
<i>Kilberg, the heart within me's crying</i>

894
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:38,870
<i>Klingelly, plingelly, klingelly,</i>
<i>plang!</i>

895
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,708
Andreas ...

896
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,837
I think you should stop
for a moment.

897
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,198
After all,
not everyone is fond of music.

898
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,350
I'd better show you your room.

899
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,719
I'd rather
you didn't put me up in the attic.

900
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,633
Now you see what's those
meaningless studies has made him.

901
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,751
A fop, that's what.

902
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,231
A popinjay who sings smutty songs.
That's what we've got for our money!

903
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,159
That has nothing to do
with his study of economics.

904
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,717
No, but what about his foppish clothes?
All his frills and furbelows?

905
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,389
Would you have preferred him
to become a pedant? A prig?

906
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,433
He could have studied theology.
That's what I've always said!

907
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:26,276
Wenzel, he's right.
We must improve the peasants' lot.

908
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,189
If you'd understand that,
you might get more tithes from them.

909
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,273
Goodbye!

910
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,031
Oh, my dearest ...

911
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:03,716
You look terrible.
What's the matter, my love?

912
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,554
Will you come home with me today?

913
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,318
Of course I will.
We'll just leave.

914
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:20,279
Never mind the Alderman.
We'll sail alone.

915
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,151
This is so exciting!
It's as if you're eloping with me.

916
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,954
Almighty and merciful God,
Heavenly Father ...

917
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,270
I know
I should be satisfied, -

918
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,631
- and find comfort in the gifts
that each day -

919
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:10,117
- and in abundance
you bestow upon me.

920
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,311
But you know my heart ...

921
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,072
... and you know my gratitude comes
from a mind filled with unrest.

922
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,951
For I fear that my happiness
will last only a short while.

923
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:28,316
For my love has indeed a soul
that is -

924
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,314
<i>- much better</i>
<i>and purer than mine ...</i>

925
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,312
<i>... yet she cannot control her heart.</i>

926
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,556
<i>Both of us fear</i>
<i>this heart of hers ...</i>

927
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:45,394
<i>.. for it is so ungovernable</i>
<i>and blind ...</i>

928
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,748
<i>... that in our mortal weakness</i>
<i>our only refuge is your divine Grace.</i>

929
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,031
<i>Yet it confounds me ...</i>

930
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,590
<i>... that in spite of my anguish ...</i>

931
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,236
<i>... each new day is richer</i>
<i>than any other I've had in my life.</i>

932
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:05,235
It's as if love between two mortals
is like a flame -

933
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,275
- that burns brightest when it is
fanned by the breath of anxiety.

934
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:15,637
If you had been here you would
scarcely have recognised Torshavn.

935
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,197
Everything is different now.
We've had a ball, -

936
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:22,358
- and soon we'll be performing
a play in the warehouse.

937
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,957
As you can guess, Andreas Heyde is
the man behind all this revelry.

938
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,108
I look forward to your
visiting soon, -

939
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,949
- so you can see my little
Augustus Gabrielsen.

940
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:36,391
He has the sweetest tooth ever.

941
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:39,069
With lots of love
from your dear friend -

942
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,351
- Suzanne Harme.

943
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,554
Are you sorry you won't be
seeing the play in Torshavn?

944
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:57,474
No, Paul ... I'm not sorry.

945
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,797
I'd much rather stay here
and have Christmas with you.

946
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,878
I'm looking forward to it.

947
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,160
We'll really celebrate Christmas
together.

948
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,591
We can go visit the Alderman.
He always has guests for Christmas.

949
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,993
Barbara, there is something
I have to tell you.

950
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,753
I would have told you before, -

951
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,350
- but you seemed so happy that
I couldn't bring myself to say it.

952
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:28,069
I've got to sail over to Mykines -

953
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:31,272
- on Christmas Day.
I've promised.

954
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,909
But, Paul ...

955
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:36,314
No minister goes to Mykines
this late in the year.

956
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,349
Not even Pastor Niels.
If there's a storm -

957
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,558
- you'll never leave there.
You could be stranded for months.

958
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,513
My dearest, I don't want
to leave you.

959
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,637
But I've neglected them.

960
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,357
People over there haven't seen
a minister in two years.

961
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,434
Children run around unbaptized,
like heathens.

962
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,673
Young people are living in sin
because there's no one to marry them.

963
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,236
The dead lie unblessed in their graves.
I had to make that promise.

964
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,630
To come for Christmas?
- Exactly.

965
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:09,436
For Christmas.
To make up for my remissness.

966
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,594
It'll take two days at the most.

967
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,797
And if the weather's bad, -

968
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,117
- I won't be leaving at all.

969
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,960
So perhaps we should
pray for bad weather.

970
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,278
Yes.

971
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:07,795
Yes?

972
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:14,158
Good morning. God bless this house,
and merry Christmas.

973
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,916
God bless you,
and merry Christmas.

974
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,913
The wind is in the south-east, -

975
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,714
- so we'll have a smooth crossing
if we leave now.

976
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,033
Go down to the water and make
the boat ready. I'll soon be with you.

977
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,153
<i>Kristina?</i>

978
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,836
<i>Where's the Pastor's shirt?</i>

979
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:38,115
<i>Where shall I put it?</i>
<i>- In the bag.</i>

980
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,113
<i>I'll fetch a pair of socks.</i>

981
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:59,193
It looks as though you'll be having
visitors for Christmas.

982
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:04,597
If I'm not mistaken, the Alderman's
three sons are coming ashore.

983
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,635
Yes, it's Samson and Mikkel.

984
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,115
And Jacob, I suppose.

985
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,389
No, not Jacob.
It's Andreas.

986
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,234
Never mind.
They won't find anyone at home.

987
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,631
I'll come with you up over the fells.
They'll just have to wait.

988
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:04,757
The boat's ready.
- Thank you.

989
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:08,836
Can you manage to get back
today already? If you hurry?

990
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,715
Is that possible? To get there
and back again in a day?

991
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,874
Everything lies in God's hands.
But if the Pastor will hurry, -

992
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,839
- we can wait for him.

993
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:25,353
Yes, Paul ...
Hurry back already this evening.

994
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,952
I'll be longing for you.

995
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:34,996
Dear, sweet Barbara ...
Can you forget me in a day or two?

996
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,397
My dearest Paul,
you know what I want the most.

997
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,711
Come back soon.

998
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,359
Likewise I do ask thee,
Toevrun Joensen, -

999
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,469
- wilt thou take Jogvan Mohr Eliasen,
to be your wedded husband?

1000
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:21,431
I do.

1001
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,198
Erlandur Ulrich Jessen -

1002
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,758
- I baptize you in the name
of the Father ...

1003
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,718
... and of the Son ...

1004
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,351
... and of the Holy Ghost.

1005
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,713
From dust art thou come ...

1006
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,878
... unto dust shalt thou return ...

1007
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,598
... from dust
shalt thou be resurrected.

1008
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,270
It's the wrong place, Pastor.
I can hear the coffin here.

1009
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,029
Pastor!

1010
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,595
You forgot to baptize a child.

1011
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:15,790
Why wasn't the child in church?
- The child wasn't born at the time.

1012
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,630
<i>It can't be done.</i>
<i>The Pastor's boat is waiting.</i>

1013
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,030
Let me baptize it quickly, then.

1014
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:44,111
<i>Bring us the child.</i>

1015
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,791
Where' the child?

1016
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,715
It hasn't been born yet,
but it can't be long, now.

1017
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,834
Eline usually drops them, like ...
- 'Struth, Hanus Elias!

1018
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:57,839
Is this some vulgar joke?
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

1019
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:01,516
It won't take a minute.
I'll just go have a look.

1020
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,234
No. I'm leaving now.
- It can't wait.

1021
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,190
Please don't go.

1022
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:28,638
The child has been born.
It just needs to be made presentable.

1023
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,957
Bring in the child, then.
Goddamn it!

1024
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,715
What name is he to have?

1025
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:46,837
Niklas Lucas Ragnar Torleif
Gulak Lazarus ...

1026
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,515
Stop!
Are you out of your mind?

1027
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,837
Niklas Bonde, I baptize you
in the name of the Father, -

1028
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,799
- the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1029
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:57,553
Amen, that's it.

1030
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,950
The Pastor's here! Come in!

1031
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,472
<i>It's impossible.</i>
<i>The surf is too heavy.</i>

1032
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:19,635
It can't be done.
- It can't?

1033
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,714
It has to!
Come in!

1034
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,790
Come in!

1035
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:10,353
Our Father ... Almighty God.

1036
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,753
Help me in my hour of need.

1037
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,918
Help me to come home.

1038
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,717
Barbara?

1039
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,951
Where's Barbara?

1040
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:38,829
Mistress Aggersøe left for Torshavn.
on a visit two weeks ago.

1041
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:42,999
Two weeks ago?
- Yes.

1042
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,554
Who ..? Who ..?

1043
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,710
Is there something
the Pastor would like to ask?

1044
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:40,076
Barbara has left me.

1045
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,869
Let's go up to my study.

1046
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:49,079
Aunt Armgard is staying with us.

1047
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,439
I'm extremely appalled by this.

1048
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:04,719
It was very much against my wishes
that they went to Torshavn together.

1049
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,998
But I couldn't stop them.

1050
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:12,436
It's impossible to talk to people
when that madness is on them.

1051
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:19,598
Andreas should have done his research,
but all he did was -

1052
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:24,396
- flirt and fool around.
He didn't write a single line.

1053
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,676
I suppose you drink schnapps?

1054
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:31,754
No, thank you. Not now.
I ... No, thank you.

1055
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:37,756
I don't have a mind for spirits either,
when I'm in a bad mood.

1056
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,355
But you might drink it as medicine.

1057
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,995
It's good for the heart.

1058
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,115
I'm not the least bit surprised.

1059
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,908
I saw it coming.

1060
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:01,235
But I couldn't have done
otherwise.

1061
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,392
Maybe that's why.

1062
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:09,159
That's the way it is, I suppose.

1063
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,191
Good day, Pastor Paul.

1064
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:21,272
How is your life these days?
- Good, thanks. And you?

1065
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,639
What kind of life can you have
when your kin has become degenerate?

1066
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:29,237
It's been a long time
since you last saw a razor.

1067
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:36,188
When I look at it rightly, I suppose
it isn't all that overwhelming.

1068
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:41,673
One should be able to rise above
one's own fate.

1069
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:46,558
I can see
what's so laughable about it.

1070
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,875
We'll see.

1071
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:55,990
Barbara changes her mind
like the wind blows, often.

1072
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,119
Do you really mean ...

1073
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,597
... that she'll come back?

1074
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,630
No, I don't think so.

1075
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:14,438
If I could just once ...

1076
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:18,192
... just once ...

1077
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,438
... I would ask nothing more of her.

1078
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:24,757
Barbara, I long for you so!

1079
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,589
It's not that I want to be spared
my punishment.

1080
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,031
This'll help. Drink it.

1081
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,595
"Oh Lord, your rods chastise," -

1082
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:49,948
- "you've made me old and wise."

1083
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,794
I don't know that hymn.

1084
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:55,469
But it's right, isn't it?

1085
01:44:55,720 --> 01:45:00,191
"Oh Lord, your rods chastise,
you've made me old and wise."

1086
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,352
That's how it is.

1087
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,956
Poor Pastor Paul,
you're a simple-hearted man.

1088
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,351
The Lord would never chastise you.
But <i>she, -</i>

1089
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:13,838
- who keeps corrupting the young
an now <i>our</i> family, too, -

1090
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,150
- when she comes under
the Lord's rod, -

1091
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,153
- then we shall see chastisement!

1092
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,990
Is that how it is?

1093
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,071
Samuel Mikkelsen ...

1094
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:33,950
Do you have capable men
who can row me to Torshavn?

1095
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,156
Or to Kirkjubøur?

1096
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:38,078
I can cross the fells myself.

1097
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:42,592
I expected you to ask that ...

1098
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:46,757
... but the weather is not good.

1099
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:50,074
The winds and waters
are at odds with each other.

1100
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:53,039
The moon is very close to Earth.

1101
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,351
But ...

1102
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,959
... my sons are headstrong
and they fear nothing.

1103
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,711
So, we'd better try to sail.
For the Pastor's sake.

1104
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:08,230
The devil take it,
not for the Pastor's sake!

1105
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,358
A pitiful priest
who can't control his own wife.

1106
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,830
No, you will sail
for the family's sake, -

1107
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:16,508
- so that whore doesn't ruin
Andreas completely!

1108
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:23,473
<i>The tide's got hold of us!</i>
<i>- We're going to run aground!</i>

1109
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,551
Row harder!
- Keep in stroke, Samson!

1110
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,676
Row, damn it,
or I can't steer the boat!

1111
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:42,950
Row! Row! Row!

1112
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:13,230
We're going ashore here!
Row harder!

1113
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:41,875
Is that the way to Torshavn?
- Yes, up over the fells.

1114
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,269
Good God, man,
are you really in such a hurry?

1115
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,758
<i>Run after the Pastor</i>
<i>with a torch.</i>

1116
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,799
Pastor Paul!

1117
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,397
Wait for me!

1118
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,198
Barbara!

1119
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,511
If it don't hurt -

1120
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,392
- then I'm dreaming.
If it hurts, -

1121
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,750
- then I ain't dreaming.

1122
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:29,518
I'm awake, all right.

1123
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:35,238
Nobody can argue me out of that.
Because if I weren't ...

1124
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:39,989
But, if I reason it aright,
how can I be awake?

1125
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,994
I'm Jeppe on the hill.

1126
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:47,832
I'm sure I'm a penniless peasant,
a slave, a rogue, a cuckold, -

1127
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,719
- a starving louse,
a maggot and a rascal!

1128
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:55,829
How then, can I be a lord
in a castle?

1129
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:59,717
No ...
It can't just be a dream.

1130
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:04,438
I'd best be patient and
wait and see if I wake up.

1131
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,439
Alas!

1132
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:12,269
What did I hear in my sleep?
No, it ain't possible.

1133
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:17,151
But if it is a dream I hope
that I'll never wake up again.

1134
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:21,028
And if I'm mad I hope
I never get sane again.

1135
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:24,198
For the I'd summon
the doctor who cured me -

1136
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,914
- and I'd curse the one
who woke me up.

1137
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:29,276
But I ain't dreaming,
nor am I mad.

1138
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:32,671
For I remember everything
that has befallen me.

1139
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:35,070
I remember that ...

1140
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:50,712
My dearest, are you mad?
Are you absolutely mad?

1141
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,759
And why do you look like that?

1142
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,998
Barbara ...

1143
01:50:56,280 --> 01:51:00,353
I've come to you.
- You've come to me?

1144
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,872
But how in the world?
In this weather?

1145
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,031
Did you cross the fells?

1146
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,754
From Kirkjubøur ...

1147
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:13,233
But my dearest love,
crossing the fells in the dark?

1148
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:18,314
Come with me.
Let's go home.

1149
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,073
Do you love him?

1150
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,638
Yes.

1151
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:49,837
Eat.
You must be hungry.

1152
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:51,918
And afterwards,
you must go to bed.

1153
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:55,393
Shall I sit with you
till you fall asleep?

1154
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,676
I'll do that.

1155
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,192
What's to become of me?

1156
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:12,631
My dearest love,
you mustn't be so unhappy.

1157
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,271
Shall I tell you something?

1158
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:19,834
You have no reason to be.
None at all.

1159
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:23,277
I feel the same way about you
as I always have.

1160
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:27,070
Do you love me as always?

1161
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,908
I love you
as I've always done, -

1162
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,230
- and I'm glad you're here again.

1163
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,837
Good morning, my love.

1164
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:48,629
I'm so glad you came.
We've never been this happy together.

1165
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:52,112
Like the time in the alcove
when I reached out to you.

1166
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,397
But what about ..?

1167
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,953
About Andreas?

1168
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:06,353
Don't tell anybody about this,
do you hear?

1169
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:08,312
This is our secret.

1170
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:14,755
I can't imagine how desperate
he'd be if he knew about it.

1171
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,632
Are you sorry about last night?

1172
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:25,552
No ...
No, I'm not sorry.

1173
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:28,191
But now I'm going to visit Andreas.

1174
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:32,878
He was probably drunk last night.
There was a ball after the play.

1175
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:41,074
Why do you turn your back on me?

1176
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:43,997
I think you're cross with me.

1177
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:52,472
I'm not cross with you.
I was just thinking.

1178
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:59,595
You're in love with some one else -

1179
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,075
- and I'm in your way.

1180
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,430
It would be best if I could
get you out of my mind.

1181
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:11,077
Don't you think?

1182
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:16,518
But I'm not the one you love.

1183
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:26,439
You know how much I love you.

1184
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:29,756
Everything between us
is like it's always been.

1185
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,998
And it'll remain that way,
won't it?

1186
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:38,832
If you hadn't gone to Mykines
this would never have happened.

1187
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:48,475
I'm sure Andreas is waiting for me.

1188
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:53,033
But I promise to be back
this evening.

1189
01:56:55,600 --> 01:57:00,151
I'll look forward to that.
Everything will be like the old days.

1190
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,310
Well, now I've become
my own wife's lover, -

1191
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:17,752
- and the other has become
his own cuckold's cuckold.

1192
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:22,154
Isn't that beautifully put?
- I'm not really sure.

1193
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:25,957
But it's certainly a cheerful way
of looking at things.

1194
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:28,157
That's my choice.

1195
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,595
And you realise that you are
in the perilous waters ...

1196
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:34,799
... which I foresaw you entering?
- Only too well.

1197
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:39,631
But you are weathering them well,
if I may put it that way?

1198
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:42,991
Yes, I'm in a storm of passion.

1199
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:47,034
A desperate passion,
an exultant passion.

1200
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:51,593
I never knew I could have so many
strong feelings at once.

1201
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,759
Then it may be that God has not
wasted his misfortunes on you, -

1202
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,548
- that you are an instrument
worthy of Him.

1203
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,589
By the truth of the Holy Ghost,
I am.

1204
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:08,072
A wind instrument, I believe.
And the Lord is blowing on me mightily.

1205
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:13,675
You're probably no bassoon.
But ...

1206
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:17,590
... a woodwind instrument.
A trifle monotenous, perhaps, -

1207
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:20,394
- but still the most beautiful.

1208
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:29,394
The main thing is to have a temperament
which is not broken by misfortune.

1209
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:35,032
Desperation and rage may be
the best winds to sail by.

1210
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:37,754
But don't sail too close to them.

1211
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,710
Don't kill my brother's son,
anyway.

1212
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,877
I assure you ...

1213
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,914
... I have almost
a colleagues affection for him.

1214
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:51,550
I doubt it will last.

1215
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:54,957
It's very unfortunate,
what he's doing.

1216
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,874
He could do great things
for his country and himself.

1217
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,911
Now he doesn't even do
an honest day's work.

1218
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:25,232
Good evening, Pastor Paul.

1219
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,436
Good evening.

1220
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:30,958
Excuse me, but ...
is Barbara here?

1221
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,714
No, I haven't seen her all day.

1222
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,674
But Pastor Paul,
won't you come inside?

1223
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:41,669
And where is Barbara, I mean,
Mistress Aggersøe this evening?

1224
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,232
She's out ... but ...
I'm expecting her home soon.

1225
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:49,154
You have a long wait ahead of you.

1226
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:53,672
Yes, he has.
He has a long wait ahead of him.

1227
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:10,471
I've never known anything more foolish
than your marriage to Barbara.

1228
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:12,956
Let's not talk about Barbara.

1229
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:16,311
Isn't Pastor Paul allowed
to talk about his own wife?

1230
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,511
Here you are, Pastor.

1231
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:24,554
I don't know how much
you mean to put up with, -

1232
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,518
- but I can arrest her, -

1233
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:29,678
- if you like.
And her lover, too.

1234
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:34,559
Arrest her?
And make myself a laughing-stock?

1235
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:38,237
You're a laughing-stock already.
It can't be much worse.

1236
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:41,318
Do you want to be another
Pastor Niels? Or worse?

1237
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:48,079
She's more lecherous and shameless
than ever before.

1238
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:51,835
And under all our noses, too.
- You're such a busybody.

1239
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:57,518
It's my and your father's job
to guard the morality in this country.

1240
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:02,749
But it's your housewifely duty
to take the whore's part.

1241
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:05,952
And invite her in for coffee
as soon as I leave the house.

1242
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:13,317
Let's see what the law says.

1243
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:16,748
Let's see ...

1244
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,916
Homicide ...

1245
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:30,796
Maiming and wounding ...
Domestic peace, church peace ...

1246
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:33,880
"On loose behaviour."

1247
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:40,669
"Whoever lies with a a woman
shall pay 24 pieces of silver" -

1248
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:44,037
- "to her family and 12 pieces
of silver to the woman," -

1249
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:46,714
- "and both shall confess in public."

1250
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,669
That's for unmarried people.
I thought that was too mild.

1251
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:54,159
A whipping wouldn't be too much.
- I don't want her to be punished!

1252
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:57,432
I don't want that.
No punishment.

1253
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:03,793
Perhaps she'll come to reason.
- I'm sure she will.

1254
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:08,349
I'll be damned if she does.
- Well, whipping her won't help.

1255
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:12,872
Be quiet. I'm not sure there <i>is</i>
any authority for whipping her.

1256
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:17,075
But God knows that's what she needs.
Come, Pastor. Sit down.

1257
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:21,553
All I'm saying is that
she needs a good hiding.

1258
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,149
What business is it of yours?

1259
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:26,079
It's Pastor Paul's own business.
He'll punish her, if he wants to.

1260
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:30,309
Yes ... Exactly.
It's my own business.

1261
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,915
Then why the hell
don't you thrash her?

1262
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:34,548
That's what all husbands do.

1263
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,633
Are you as spineless as Pastor Niels,
who'd rather be thrashed himself?

1264
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:41,549
What a worm.
Pitiful, that's what he was.

1265
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:44,076
I don't even know where they are.

1266
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:46,794
But I do.
Andreas lives in the little house ...

1267
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:50,595
The little house besides "China".
The speak-easy, you know.

1268
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:52,159
What should I do?

1269
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,509
Show her who's the master of the house.
She's asking for it.

1270
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:58,789
It's your duty.

1271
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,719
It won't help to punish Barbara.
It'll only harden her.

1272
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,992
That time the sister and brother
from Stakkenæs committed incest, -

1273
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,760
- her own mother dragged her along
to the execution, -

1274
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,197
- and then she beat her severely.
And what good did it do?

1275
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,789
None at all.
Barbara can't be chastened.

1276
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,719
It's utterly stupid.
It's idiotic!

1277
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,473
She's coming back home,
that's for certain!

1278
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:21,679
Where is she?
- Next door to "China".

1279
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,751
Come with me.
- Gabriel, stay here.

1280
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:35,758
Come on, Gabriel.

1281
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:40,430
Damn it! Damn it!
- Pastor Paul. It'll brace you up.

1282
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:45,793
This way.

1283
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:49,191
She's coming home.
Whether she likes it or not.

1284
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:04,035
Is this the house?
Gabriel?

1285
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:07,231
We have to catch them red-handed.

1286
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,398
Jesus Christ ...

1287
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:12,752
They haven't gone to bed yet.
But he hasn't got any shoes on.

1288
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:17,079
He's sat down on a chair.
They must be going to bed.

1289
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:18,595
And Barbara?

1290
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:22,192
Good God.
Barbara is in the alcove.

1291
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:27,555
She's getting up.
She has nothing on but a shift.

1292
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:28,630
Come see.

1293
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:34,278
She's putting her arms
around his neck.

1294
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:37,518
I bet he can feel her tits
at the back of his neck.

1295
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:40,076
She's kissing him on the ear.

1296
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,878
What's that in his hand?

1297
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,311
I can't see.

1298
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:49,436
She's put her shift over his head!

1299
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:54,200
How shameless she is.

1300
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:55,998
Come.

1301
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:01,749
She's pulling him by the hair.
They're going into the alcove ...

1302
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,797
No, Goddamn it, I've had enough!

1303
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:08,113
Open up, you spawn of the devil!
- No, you're spoiling everything.

1304
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:10,636
They must be in bed,
or we can't arrest them.

1305
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:12,796
Like hell they do!
Open up!

1306
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:15,349
Move away. Move away.

1307
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:20,516
Stop! In the King's name!

1308
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:24,476
The devil take you!

1309
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,520
Hell, what a pigsty!

1310
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:31,236
Well, box her ears for her.
Show her who's in charge!

1311
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:34,950
Paul, what are you doing here?

1312
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:40,869
Do something, man!
It's not my job to thrash her.

1313
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:43,031
Box her ears for her!

1314
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:45,311
Then I'll lock her up
in the dungeon.

1315
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:48,671
In the King's name,
Barbara Christina, -

1316
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:51,673
- you are under arrest
for adultery and fornication!

1317
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:55,758
Here it is.
Andreas' great work.

1318
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,551
"The Faroes: It's nature and people."
Half a page. That's all.

1319
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:06,513
You're under arrest
for adultery and fornication.

1320
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:27,236
You must stop Gabriel. He's mad.
- Sit down, Andreas.

1321
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,271
The other thing can wait.

1322
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:33,318
He has no right, no authority.

1323
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:38,637
Fornication, perhaps?
- Well, now that you mention it.

1324
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:45,154
Just let her spend the night there
and think things over.

1325
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,552
Andreas ...

1326
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:50,630
Now that you're here ...

1327
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:58,349
How's your work coming along?
Your scientific report?

1328
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,275
I'd better tell you the truth.

1329
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:07,950
I know you won't judge me
as harshly as others would, -

1330
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:10,270
- but I'm ashamed to admit it ...

1331
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:14,513
I've hardly even started.
That is to say, I had ...

1332
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,233
... but ...

1333
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:19,552
... then Barbara came along.
- How far?

1334
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:22,439
How far have you got?

1335
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:26,875
I've made many notes.

1336
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:29,432
How much have you written?

1337
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:33,717
Not more than ...

1338
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:35,798
... ten to twenty pages.

1339
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:45,590
Let's say you had completed
your report, -

1340
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:48,593
- and that everything else was
as it now stands.

1341
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:55,073
Would you then, without hesitation,
sail back on the "Fortuna" tomorrow?

1342
02:07:56,240 --> 02:07:59,038
If I had completed my report ...

1343
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:03,149
Yes. I guess I would.

1344
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:05,829
And leave her behind?

1345
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:08,915
That would be hard.

1346
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:11,760
I had thought
it would be more casual.

1347
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:15,436
But you would be able to
leave her behind?

1348
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,639
Yes.

1349
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:23,274
You haven't deserved it -

1350
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:26,074
- and it won't help to
make you more industrious, -

1351
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:28,436
- but something had to be done, -

1352
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:31,438
- so I've written your report
for you. There you are.

1353
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:35,033
Now you leave on the "Fortuna"
tomorrow morning.

1354
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:21,232
Gabriel!

1355
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:27,639
What the Hell are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

1356
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:30,599
Arresting people
without warrant or authority?

1357
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:33,109
For fornication ...
- Fornication?!

1358
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:36,118
Then you might as well throw
half the town in the dungeon!

1359
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,550
I've always known you were
a contemptible rascal, -

1360
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:42,719
- but that you could be so completely
unfit to serve as Bailie ...

1361
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:45,793
But that's over now!
Over!

1362
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:49,310
Now release Barbara.

1363
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:05,277
Barbara ...

1364
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,558
... come.

1365
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:13,272
<i>Way anchor!</i>
<i>Way anchor!</i>

1366
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:17,030
<i>Two fathoms!</i>

1367
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:21,918
Where is Andreas?

1368
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:25,593
He left on the "Fortuna".

1369
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,797
Andreas!

1370
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:49,310
Andreas!

1371
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:06,828
Andreas!

1372
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:05,032
<i>I too have heard rumors,</i>

1374
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:11,190

<i>Mainly arrogant vanity.</i>
