1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,796
Thank you.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,390
This won't hurt a bit.

3
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,789
...labour pains...

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,597
...the routine use of drugs...
...may be determined...

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,557
...when the physiological,
sometimes fatal...

6
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,320
When contraction problems
occur-

7
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,559
- the pain can be relieved
with suitable drugs.

8
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,231
Thus the pain will disappear
or decrease.

9
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,913
In case... In case of a painful
but quite normal labour-

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,830
- the effect of the medium on the child
should be taken into account.

11
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,875
Relatively little is known about
the effect of certain anaesthetics.

12
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,435
Further research is needed.

13
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,394
The aim of obstetrics
is a healthy child-

14
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,160
- and minimum inconvenience
to the mother.

15
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,238
Now I submit my thesis
for your expert criticism.

16
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,796
Mrs Kivi's research shows...

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,790
...we still have a long way to go...
...Clarke & Russell, 1967...

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,878
...delivery without danger...

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:28,111
...an insuperable barrier
for our human knowledge...

20
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,475
We rely too easily on the statistical
and mathematical basis-

21
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,435
- provided by modem science.
We may thus forget-

22
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,757
- that pain, too, is
a manifestation of our culture.

23
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,308
...Mrs Kivi is hereby awarded her
Doctor of Medicine degree.

24
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,478
<i>My name is Anna.</i>

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,949
<i>My housekeeper is called Helena.</i>

26
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,469
<i>My daughter is called Liisa.</i>

27
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,310
<i>Helena has been working for me</i>
for a couple of months now.

28
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,117
<i>I got my M.D. Yesterday.</i>

29
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,914
<i>I felt like laughing.</i>

30
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,915
<i>I've been writing my doctoral thesis</i>
for three years.

31
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,759
<i>I was divorced several years ago.</i>

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,520
<i>I bought the flat</i>
so I could keep it.

33
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,109
<i>I haven't asked for maintenance-</i>

34
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,074
- <i>because my ex-husband</i>
earns less than I do.

35
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,831
<i>I am an anaesthetist at the</i>
Turku University Central Hospital.

36
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,955
<i>Although I'm used to this life,</i>
I don't like it.

37
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,239
- Ice <i>cream?</i>
- No, thanks.

38
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,637
- I want some.
- You'll get a tummy ache.

39
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,876
- Come on.
- Stop that whining.

40
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,958
- Ice <i>cream?</i>
- What have you <i>got?</i>

41
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,675
- Do you still feel <i>nauseous?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

42
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,269
The pill doesn't suit everyone.

43
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,677
- I don't take it anymore.
- Why <i>not?</i>

44
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,839
- I don't need it.
- Suit yourself.

45
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,229
- You promised to pay for it.
- I forgot. You'll get the money.

46
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,553
Do you have <i>your period?</i>
You're so moody.

47
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,710
- I'm fine.
- Maybe there's a storm coming.

48
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,476
- What are you looking at, <i>Mummy?</i>
- I don't know.

49
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,958
More people seem
to be coming here this year.

50
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,112
Is Arvo coming this summer, <i>too?</i>

51
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,154
- Was he here last year?
- Don't you remember?

52
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,229
Yes, I guess he was here
for a couple of days.

53
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,750
There must be
some way of getting off the island.

54
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,988
Oh, God, we've got to get there first.

55
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,795
- Hello.
- Hello.

56
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,514
Spring arrived late this year.

57
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,792
The worse the winter,
the better the summer.

58
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,152
May I introduce myself.
We're neighbours.

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,876
- Kalle Koivu.
- Kivi. How do you <i>do?</i>

60
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,596
Koivisto here said that I can join you
if you don't mind.

61
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,749
My son was supposed to come and
pick me up. He must have forgotten.

62
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,272
- Young people often do.
- Of course, if Koivisto said okay.

63
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,436
You go first, Liisa.

64
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,918
- I rented Virtanen's place.
- I'm glad we won't be alone.

65
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,271
Can you give me a hand, <i>Koivisto?</i>

66
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,438
Hi. Do you have <i>children?</i>

67
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,431
I have a son, Veikko, who was
supposed to come and meet me.

68
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,712
- Do you care for <i>some?</i>
- Sure.

69
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,076
- Helena!
- I'm an adult. You're not my guardian.

70
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,831
- I left my typewriter in the car.
- I'll get it.

71
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,828
Thank you. It's in the boot.
Here's the key.

72
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,958
- Who is that <i>man?</i>
- He's a former MP.

73
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,230
Former...

74
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,117
<i>A year ago on the same boat.</i>

75
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,630
<i>I came to the island with Arvo</i>
in <i>early</i> spring.

76
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,877
<i>It was cold.</i>
The countryside was barren.

77
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,117
<i>I was full of anticipation and joy.</i>

78
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,757
<i>We had fun together.</i>
Nature was still dead.

79
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,593
<i>Arvo embraced me playfully. Koivisto</i>
turned his back on us, being tactful.

80
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,794
<i>Arvo whispered something in my ear</i>
and laughed.

81
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,189
<i>My life seemed better then.</i>
I hadn't noticed anything yet.

82
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,116
It's stuffy in here.
We must give it a good airing.

83
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,754
What are we going
to the neighbours for?

84
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,916
I'd like to go.

85
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,990
- Helena, you'll be sleeping here.
- I see.

86
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,558
You go and warm up the sauna.
I'll start planning my lecture.

87
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,799
Where's the typewriter?
Oh, here it is.

88
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,195
- Whose are <i>these?</i>
- Don't know.

89
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,393
- Are these <i>Arvo's?</i>
- Maybe.

90
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,277
Helena can wear them. Don't just stand
there. Go and scrub the sauna floor.

91
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,793
Veikko!

92
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,716
Veikko!

93
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,270
Hi there!

94
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,950
Don't run away.

95
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,630
- I'm Veikko.
- So <i>what?</i>

96
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,753
Oh, you're here already.
We're not quite ready yet.

97
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,757
- Do you <i>smoke?</i>
- Of course.

98
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,158
- But Anna doesn't approve.
- She can't stop you.

99
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,999
Well, no, but...

100
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,516
- Are you going to be here all summer?
- Where else would I <i>be?</i>

101
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,633
For me this is work, not fun.

102
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,994
- Does she pay you <i>well?</i>
- 250 a month.

103
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,672
- In Sweden you'd earn a lot more.
- I don't want to go to Sweden.

104
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,078
- Let's go for a boat ride.
- I have work to do.

105
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,636
You seem a bit uptight.

106
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,879
Give me the buckets
and get lost!

107
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,757
- Try to concentrate on the buckets.
- Don't get mad.

108
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,353
- What kind of a woman is that <i>Anna?</i>
- The same as everybody else, I guess.

109
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,996
- She goes on a bit too much.
- How do you <i>mean?</i>

110
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,399
Why do you keep asking <i>me?</i>
Go and ask her yourself!

111
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,472
- Okay, I will.
- Take the buckets like you promised!

112
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,319
That cigarette tasted really foul.

113
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,229
- Give me a kiss.
- No way. Keep your hands off me!

114
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,911
Come on,
we have to get the fishing nets out.

115
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,955
- Hi!
- Hello.

116
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,789
- So you're Kalle's son.
- Yeah.

117
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,513
Helena's going fishing now.

118
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,151
Take those nets.

119
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,750
- Try to row straight.
- I'm trying. This is not easy.

120
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,157
- I'm no fisherwoman.
- It won't kill you to learn.

121
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,035
Can't you row a bit <i>more?</i>
For Christ's sake.

122
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,030
You must know something about this.

123
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,878
- What are you <i>doing?</i>
- Just testing if you're awake.

124
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,389
Row back home now.

125
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,074
Don't swim too far out when you're
here alone. The water is still cold.

126
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,990
Beware of the snakes.
Liisa's used to them but you're not.

127
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,478
Stop smirking at everything I say!
It's a long way to the doctor.

128
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,878
- Do you like my <i>mummy?</i>
- Yeah, <i>why?</i>

129
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,675
- Many people don't like her.
- Why <i>not?</i>

130
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,431
They say she's stuck-up
but she doesn't care.

131
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,633
- Is your mummy <i>nice?</i>
- Yeah, though sometimes she gets mad.

132
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,071
It's nice when she talks
about all sorts of things.

133
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,637
- What does she <i>do?</i>
- She just works all the time.

134
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,879
- Then she's got Arvo.
- <i>Arvo?</i>

135
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:25,031
Goddamn idiots get to rule
and decide things for us.

136
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,792
People like me-

137
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,073
- who have been
working hard for years-

138
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,114
- get booted out.

139
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,436
The public votes for
all kinds of TV pundits-

140
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,317
- who know nothing about anything.

141
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,878
- They just babble on.
- Don't talk bullshit again.

142
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:07,031
I apologise for my son.
His vocabulary is somewhat limited.

143
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,355
I've never had time for politics.
I've worked all my life.

144
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,552
Don't think
that this is just a woman talking.

145
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,116
Most of my male colleagues
feel the same.

146
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,917
We work hard. Politicians have
their own business and I have mine.

147
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,999
- Are you <i>angry?</i>
- No, I just feel a bit funny.

148
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,829
You looked angry.

149
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,398
Helena, where do you go out
dancing during the winter?

150
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,195
Or do you prefer to
have fun at <i>home?</i>

151
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,439
You only live once.
Better make the most of it.

152
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,435
- Where are you <i>going?</i>
- Come and show me around.

153
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,712
- Kalle is a bit drunk.
- I'll go and talk to him.

154
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,789
What the hell are you <i>doing?</i>
First you ask people over-

155
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,037
- then you pass out stinking drunk.

156
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,392
- You think Anna will come here <i>again?</i>
- Hi!

157
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,160
We'd better go.

158
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,395
Liisa!

159
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,557
You're not much of a dancer.
I'll go now. Bye, then!

160
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,718
Helena, come on!

161
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,478
"How can you be a communist"-

162
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,959
- "when they've caused
so much suffering in this <i>world?"</i>

163
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,311
How can you be a doctor-

164
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,310
- when they've killed
so many <i>people?</i>

165
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,518
"What about <i>Czechoslovakia?"</i>
Goddamit!

166
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,749
"How are you going
to change the world"-

167
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,715
- "when you can't
even change <i>yourself?"</i>

168
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,630
Look at the socialist countries.
Everything's all right there.

169
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,878
"Moscow is pulling your strings."

170
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,676
Not my strings!

171
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,997
"Such communists don't exist."

172
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,431
But I do!

173
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,718
I still don't approve of everything
that the Soviet Union does.

174
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,919
That's why
they're working against me!

175
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,839
- Who says all <i>that?</i>
- That bitch!

176
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,715
Communism is just the same old shit.

177
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,195
To tell you the truth,
you're too old to keep up.

178
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,073
I don't give a shit
about your communism.

179
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,070
I don't want to suffer
like you've suffered.

180
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,992
"How can you approve of such
an inhuman system as <i>communism?"</i>

181
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,114
I'm not responsible
for Stalin's crimes.

182
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,634
"Of course not,
but you kept quiet about them."

183
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:58,069
Do you condone
the crimes of <i>capitalism?</i>

184
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,670
You keep quiet about them!

185
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,350
They've taken our boat.

186
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,029
- Helena! Are you <i>asleep?</i>
- No.

187
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,754
Come here, then.

188
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,590
Sit down.

189
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,598
- <i>Cigarette?</i>
- No, thanks.

190
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,792
- Rather quiet here, isn't <i>it?</i>
- I like the birds.

191
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,958
You can sleep here in this bed.
It's warmer here.

192
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:54,473
I won't bite. Here you are.

193
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,839
We can sleep late tomorrow.

194
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,830
I'll switch off the light.
Good night.

195
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,518
<i>Come closer.</i>

196
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,554
<i>The night is not over</i>
though the sun is rising.

197
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,275
<i>I like the silence.</i>

198
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,634
<i>After a sleepless night,</i>
I can drop off again in the morning.

199
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,392
- There was nothing there.
- I knew that.

200
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,752
- How did you know <i>that?</i>
- I've been here before.

201
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,873
I don't smoke.

202
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,513
- It wasn't me you came to fetch.
- What do you <i>mean?</i>

203
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,713
There's younger talent around.

204
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,789
Or do you prefer more mature <i>women?</i>

205
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,191
There's all sorts of women.
How can one remember them <i>all?</i>

206
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,918
I want to try different kinds
before I get married.

207
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,114
I'm the marrying type.
Do you believe <i>me?</i>

208
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,518
Though
I don't want to settle down yet.

209
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,595
It's different
when you're really in love.

210
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,794
- Drink and get laid and get married.
- What did you <i>say?</i>

211
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,278
Just something
I heard a long time ago.

212
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,836
Before you were born.

213
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,998
Give me a light.

214
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,953
I don't feel well. I haven't eaten
anything. Let's get back.

215
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,076
Or?

216
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,677
- Take out the seaweed, too.
- I will, I will.

217
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,839
It's always a bit tricky.

218
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,155
You can throw
the small fish to the seagulls.

219
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,115
Is the pike dead even though
its heart's still <i>beating?</i>

220
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,835
Silly you...

221
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,117
- Have you seen one of these <i>before?</i>
- No.

222
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,108
- What is <i>it?</i>
- A pike's heart.

223
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,358
Mummy! An overseas call.

224
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,558
<i>Hello?</i> Hi!
I expected you to call earlier.

225
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,198
No, I understand.
What did you <i>say?</i>

226
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,554
We've got new neighbours.
New neigh... I can't hear you.

227
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,469
I see.

228
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,309
You know I can't do that.
Don't be daft.

229
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,239
Yes, they're still here.

230
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,558
Buy me some perfume on the plane
if you have the time.

231
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,835
Get some passport photos
so I can see if you've changed.

232
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,556
I'm cleaning fish.
My hands are all bloody.

233
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,196
You think that's disgusting,
don't <i>you?</i>

234
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,868
Yes.

235
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,039
Yes.

236
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,437
Bye, then.

237
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,710
<i>The light fascinates me.</i>

238
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,471
<i>The light scares me.</i>

239
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,959
<i>Out here on the islands everything</i>
is timeless or very small.

240
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:12,111
<i>Our days are simple,</i>
fishing, eating, sauna.

241
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,871
<i>And beyond all that</i>
there's light, water, rocks-

242
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,631
- <i>islands like little grey flecks</i>
on the horizon-

243
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,832
- <i>ships that come and go.</i>

244
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,392
<i>It's a time of yeaming</i>
and retrospect-

245
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,513
- <i>regret and sorrow.</i>

246
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,996
<i>When I was young, it was wartime.</i>

247
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,318
<i>We weren't free to live.</i>

248
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,992
<i>I envy them.</i>
I'm afraid of them.

249
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,150
<i>My eyes hurt.</i>
I can't even read without glasses.

250
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,629
<i>Soon I'll only be able to see in the</i>
dim light of the operating theatre.

251
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,996
- Hi.
- Hi. Grab a glass.

252
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,112
Can you drive me to the ferry
tomorrow <i>morning?</i>

253
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,595
- Sure. What <i>time?</i>
- Six o'clock.

254
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,353
- Want to shoot dad's empty <i>bottles?</i>
- That should keep you busy.

255
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,916
Let's go over to the corf.

256
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,955
You came after all.

257
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,392
Why are you sitting indoors
on a lovely evening like <i>this?</i>

258
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,910
I can't stand being idle-

259
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,510
- so I'm sitting here drinking.

260
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,436
It's different for you.

261
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,918
You come here for a day or two
and then go back to work.

262
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,954
- Don't you have a <i>job?</i>
- No, I don't.

263
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,674
I'll be all right
for the rest of the year-

264
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,793
- but then
I'll have to start looking for a job.

265
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,470
- Don't you have any <i>friends?</i>
- Sure.

266
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,672
Former friends.

267
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,431
It's easy to hate
but hard to like someone.

268
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,313
I'm off tomorrow.
I'll be back for midsummer.

269
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,115
- Have a drink.
- No, thanks.

270
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,389
- Hello!
- What are you <i>doing?</i> I'll get all wet.

271
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,197
- Sorry, I'll get you a towel.
- Don't bother. Put the pike back.

272
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,948
Can I come and sleep over
at <i>your place?</i> I'm so cold.

273
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,516
No, you can't.
Go and sleep in your sauna.

274
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,555
- Good night.
- I love you.

275
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,197
Why haven't I got
any brothers and <i>sisters?</i>

276
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,278
- I don't have a husband.
- You've got Arvo.

277
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,793
You can't have a child with just
any man. You both have to want it.

278
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,959
- Did daddy want <i>me?</i>
- Yes, he did.

279
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,278
- And you <i>agreed?</i>
- Yes, I did.

280
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,994
Good night. Go on now.

281
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,158
Call me every night around nine.

282
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,592
See that Liisa doesn't swim too much.
Where is she <i>now?</i>

283
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:12,035
You do know that the best place for
fishing is there by the small <i>cape?</i>

284
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,349
Are you listening to <i>me?</i> Make sure
the house stays in one piece.

285
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,155
Are you leaving the <i>typewriter here?</i>

286
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,753
I can write the lecture when
I come back. There's no great hurry.

287
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,832
- Let's play something.
- Not right now.

288
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,953
- I'll go and build a hut, then.
- Don't be too long.

289
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,591
- What are you doing <i>tonight?</i>
- Why do you <i>ask?</i>

290
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,156
- I may be coming to town.
- By all means.

291
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,876
- To meet you.
- I'm flattered.

292
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,311
You should be.
I could come tomorrow.

293
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,071
- I've got to work.
- At night, <i>too?</i>

294
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,477
That's when I sleep.
Thanks for the offer.

295
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,399
It's no offer.

296
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,592
Be a good boy and give me the bag.

297
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,758
See you at midsummer!

298
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,516
Goddamit!

299
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,037
- It's tiring to watch women at work.
- Go get some water, then.

300
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,472
- Lf you come with me.
- I've got other things to do.

301
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,389
- There you are.
- Thanks.

302
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,798
- How about a little boat <i>ride?</i>
- You drive too fast.

303
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,357
- I'm a terrific driver.
- <i>You?</i>

304
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,991
I hate this goddamn wilderness.

305
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,510
I want to go to town and see people.

306
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,077
- You've got me here.
- Piss off!

307
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,552
Let's be friends.

308
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,996
You've got Anna's bracelet.

309
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,875
- So <i>what?</i>
- Hand it over. You've stolen it.

310
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,119
No way! What do you want it for?

311
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,430
- Liisa is a nice kid.
- Do you like <i>children?</i>

312
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,474
Hard to say.
As far as I know, I don't have any.

313
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,390
- You only like yourself.
- Well, someone's got to like me.

314
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,518
- Would you like to see <i>something?</i>
- Don't reveal everything at once.

315
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,314
Read this.

316
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,349
"I can't really say what I mean
but I need you."

317
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,950
"I am strong only through you."

318
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,359
"Every day I try to forget
that I'm no longer young but..."

319
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,076
- What is <i>this?</i>
- Anna's letter to her boyfriend.

320
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,716
- Why did you give it to <i>me?</i>
- It's cold!

321
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,194
You said
the water was twenty degrees.

322
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,990
What are you doing for midsummer?

323
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,795
I guess I have to join
the family in the country.

324
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,913
I don't bother about holidays,
except for Liisa's sake.

325
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,315
What are you doing <i>tonight?</i>

326
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,991
First I'll have a nice dinner and
then go home. I'm expecting a call.

327
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,955
- Want to join <i>me?</i>
- Why not, as the family's away.

328
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,594
Let's go, then.

329
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,874
- Kivinen, the cancer patient, died.
- <i>Who?</i>

330
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,995
- It wasn't you that operated on him.
- I was there.

331
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,839
We still have to eat.

332
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:08,193
Don't tickle. Leave me alone!

333
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,633
Women get tense
when they're not getting any.

334
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,796
- I'm not tense.
- <i>Really?</i>

335
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,278
I'm not! I am what I am.

336
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,758
- What are <i>you?</i>
- I'm a housekeeper.

337
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,557
A tense housekeeper. What are you
going to be when you grow <i>up?</i>

338
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,718
A soldier. I'll shoot all the men.

339
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,753
Stop that!

340
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,233
- You're rather good-looking.
- So <i>what?</i> Go get my clothes.

341
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,958
- <i>Why?</i>
- Go and get my goddamn clothes!

342
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,153
All right, then. I'll swim home.

343
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,113
Don't drown.

344
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,992
Perhaps I'll meet someone some day.
I've been working hard all my life-

345
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,796
- first to be able to study
and then just because I'm a woman.

346
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,471
- But women are emancipated now.
- <i>Emancipated?</i>

347
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,877
You've got
much more freedom than we have.

348
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,595
I'm responsible for the family
and all that. Most women...

349
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,429
- I've got a family, too.
- You're an exception.

350
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,633
There's so much in life
one must try to ignore.

351
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,833
Don't worry about things like that.
You're doing all right.

352
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,919
You've got a good job,
a decent salary-

353
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,112
- and a daughter,
who must be dear to you.

354
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,269
Of course, sometimes things seem...

355
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,952
A patient dies or you start thinking
about all the suffering in the <i>world.</i>

356
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,871
You've got to drown such feelings
so that you can go on living.

357
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,358
We all have our disappointments
that we want to forget.

358
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,476
This is my way. I'm alone in town.
I want to have a good time.

359
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,433
There are plenty of admiring nurses
who don't blab-

360
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,428
- and lady doctors that do.

361
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,188
But they all want
to talk about patients.

362
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,669
I don't want that when I'm off duty,
especially not in bed.

363
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,399
The good thing is that they're safe,
no fear of gonorrhoea.

364
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,396
But I'd rather go boozing.

365
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,353
Excuse me.

366
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,877
<i>Hello?</i>

367
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,673
<i>Hello?</i> Oh, hi.

368
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,590
When are you <i>arriving?</i>
What did you <i>say?</i>

369
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,755
"Communists mock to conceal
their ideas and intentions."

370
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,149
"They declare openly that
their aims can only be achieved"-

371
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:26,789
- "by violently disrupting
the social order."

372
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,039
"Let the ruling classes tremble"-

373
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,676
- "when
the communist revolution begins."

374
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,678
- What is <i>that?</i>
- The Manifesto.

375
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,432
- We don't read that at school.
- That's why I'm reading it to you.

376
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,509
"The proletariat have
only their chains to lose"-

377
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,473
- "that they may gain the whole world."

378
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,674
- Haven't you got any children's <i>books?</i>
- This is for children, too.

379
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,238
I'll show you
how to make a useful knot.

380
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,390
Here's a nice piece of rope.
This is how it's made.

381
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,799
Isn't that a fine <i>knot?</i>
Then you tighten it like this.

382
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,037
It won't come undone.

383
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,473
- I'll tie up the boat with it.
- You do that.

384
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,592
Where was <i>I?</i>

385
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,955
"Walk in my <i>sleep?</i> Rubbish."
"Take a look at your nightshirt."

386
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,235
"It's tom. How is that <i>possible?"</i>
"It got caught in our barbecue fork."

387
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,069
"Poor me, I do walk in my sleep.
What to <i>do?"</i>

388
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,875
"We'll tie you to the bed."

389
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,676
Veikko, what on earth are you <i>doing?</i>

390
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,668
Leave the birds alone!

391
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,276
Bloody hell! Are you <i>crazy?</i>
That was dad's gun.

392
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:57,157
- Why don't you have a <i>job?</i>
- It's more fun here.

393
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,114
It's only fun in the summer.

394
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,511
- Why are you like <i>that?</i>
- Can't I even speak <i>anymore?</i>

395
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,995
- What do you think about <i>Anna?</i>
- <i>Anna?</i>

396
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,712
She's quite a fetching bird.

397
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,718
What were you talking
about on the <i>boat?</i>

398
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,549
I don't remember. <i>Why?</i>

399
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,878
I've noticed
that you're hitting on her.

400
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,392
- She could be my mother.
- And that's all she could be.

401
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,072
There's your precious Anna's bracelet!

402
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,349
Go to hell, you toffee-nosed bastard!

403
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:11,476
- Have I hurt you <i>somehow?</i>
- You think you can do as you like.

404
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,116
I want to get out of here.

405
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,359
I don't want to be here with you lot.

406
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,518
Don't cry.
I'll get something for your foot.

407
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,468
<i>I'm still in town, though I'm</i>
meant to be on holiday already.

408
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:47,555
<i>It's quiet here in the flat,</i>
only clocks ticking.

409
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,993
<i>Every day I try to forget</i>
that I'm not a man.

410
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:00,912
<i>It's a man's world even though some</i>
women like me attain a good position.

411
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,951
<i>Everything around me is cold.</i>

412
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,917
<i>I try to live and be free</i>
but something keeps me down.

413
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,159
<i>I'd like to talk to you but even when</i>
you're here you're so far away.

414
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,558
<i>Here on paper it all seems so silly.</i>

415
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,073
<i>You are coming, aren't you?</i>

416
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:35,839
- Why haven't you got a <i>wife?</i>
- <i>A wife?</i>

417
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,318
She got what's coming to all of us.

418
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,636
Your mum's got no husband.

419
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:48,597
Mummy and daddy were divorced when
I was little. Daddy was an awful man.

420
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,952
Everybody said
mummy shouldn't live with such a twit.

421
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,594
- Who's <i>everybody?</i>
- Well, everybody.

422
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,635
Besides, mummy says
one's better off on one's own.

423
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,354
Maybe so.

424
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,759
- What does your dad <i>do?</i>
- He's a technician or something.

425
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,433
I'm going to be a doctor.
They do such valuable work.

426
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,236
So your mum wants to live alone...

427
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,951
- Are you <i>hungry?</i>
- I'll make something for both of us.

428
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,273
People seek security
in all the wrong places.

429
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,634
They wear themselves out
doing that.

430
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,355
And the others-

431
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,236
- those who have enough courage-

432
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,479
- and dare to say what they think...

433
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,279
...they get booted out.
- Were you booted <i>out?</i>

434
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,313
Yes.

435
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,753
But I don't like to admit it.

436
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:22,071
You see,
I've become tired and restless.

437
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,674
And I'm alone.

438
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,913
Stop that.
You're supposed to be tidying up.

439
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,268
You shouldn't mess up
other people's beds.

440
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,596
What's the matter with <i>you?</i>

441
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:37,079
I just don't feel like doing it now.

442
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,279
We're a bit late, I guess.

443
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,713
- Where's <i>Liisa?</i>
- With Kalle.

444
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,196
- Did you pick up the things I <i>ordered?</i>
- No.

445
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,312
What are we to <i>do?</i>
It's a public holiday.

446
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:35,594
- I can't do everything.
- What have you been doing, <i>then?</i>

447
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:45,153
- Did you hurt <i>your foot?</i>
- No.

448
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,316
I'll sit here.

449
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,318
<i>I look at myself in the mirror.</i>
Am I <i>alone?</i>

450
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,832
<i>Am I old and ugly when the others</i>
are young and <i>beautiful?</i>

451
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,838
<i>What is the colour of water?</i>

452
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,112
<i>When the</i> sky <i>is dark,</i>
the water becomes grey.

453
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,073
<i>When the sun is shining,</i>
it reflects the light.

454
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,840
<i>Is someone rising out of the water?</i>

455
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,669
<i>When it's windy,</i>
the water seems to come up to me.

456
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,908
<i>When I'm swimming, I want to</i>
experience the pressure deep down.

457
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,954
<i>I should explore the sea</i>
instead of dreams.

458
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:42,234
<i>I don't dream at night,</i>
only in daylight.

459
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,279
The sauna floor is still filthy.
You're not here on holiday!

460
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,838
I don't pay you to lark around
with Veikko. Is that clear?

461
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,637
Stop crying.

462
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,913
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're capable but...

463
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,510
I'm irritable. I don't feel well.

464
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,235
Take the rubbish away, and
we'll have a bottle of wine together.

465
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,239
Bloody hell!

466
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,991
The goddamn idiot had the nerve
to throw me out!

467
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,478
I told him
I'm not going to relieve him-

468
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,312
- just to get a chance to booze
in that rat-hole! No way!

469
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,548
And that bloody old hag
just sits there.

470
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,833
Bloody hell! I'll tell her.

471
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,316
You dried-up old twat!

472
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,348
- She'll hear you.
- She can't hear a thing.

473
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,953
She just chats on about herself.
Goddamit!

474
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,596
I'm leaving this place right now!

475
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:41,238
Take me to the ferry.
Keeping a bloody comb in your pocket!

476
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,595
- I'll throw this in.
- Chuck this one, too.

477
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:54,592
No.
I'll take the boat and drive off fast!

478
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,952
- Do you want the <i>keys?</i>
- No!

479
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,679
Keep your mouth shut
or I'll throw you in, too!

480
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,670
You rotten toffee-nosed bastard.

481
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,273
The bitch is in there, look.

482
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,234
Where are you <i>going?</i>

483
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,754
Bloody hell, that was great!

484
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,750
- Don't bum the house down!
- You can always build a new one!

485
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,999
I'll set the whole island on fire!

486
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,751
- Son!
- The whole island will bum.

487
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:35,430
- Nice going. More!
- Coming.

488
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,309
Olé!

489
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,949
That was a pathetic little bang. More!

490
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:59,229
That was even worse.
You're no good.

491
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,829
Let dad show you.

492
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,952
Don't start a row now!

493
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,556
You're here already.

494
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,514
- You like it here.
- There's only the neighbours here.

495
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,110
- Come. Let's go over there.
- No.

496
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:11,670
You seem so far away. We haven't
seen each other for a while.

497
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,832
I guess that explains it.

498
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,238
You've got a nice tan. It suits you.

499
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,196
- Listen, Anna.
- <i>Yes?</i>

500
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,393
- It's no use.
- What <i>is?</i>

501
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,957
You and me trying again.

502
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,039
It's not your fault.

503
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:45,475
In <i>your world</i> there's only room
for your own problems- and you.

504
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,433
There's no place for me there.

505
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,030
You're not concerned with
what's going on around you.

506
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,629
You're only concerned with you.

507
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,433
- I want to have a wife.
- But I love you.

508
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,790
<i>Love?</i>

509
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,434
Good night!

510
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,798
What are you doing,
thinking about <i>me?</i>

511
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,710
- Just thinking. You fool.
- Crazy woman.

512
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:36,311
Arvo, come and have some coffee.
I can't sleep.

513
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:45,714
Come and have some coffee!

514
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:16,234
- Would you come to town with <i>me?</i>
- Why not.

515
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:22,390
- I just need to find a place to live.
- It'll work out somehow.

516
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:29,273
Listen. The birds are singing.

517
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,996
- Can I ask you <i>something?</i>
- Sure.

518
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,115
- Do you love <i>me?</i>
- Of course, all the time.

519
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,354
I know you've had other women.

520
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,632
I don't care about that anymore.

521
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,230
But sometimes it hurts.

522
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,194
There you go.

523
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:05,837
Maybe you'd have felt more free
if I had someone else, too.

524
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:11,034
But I can't, I'm afraid.

525
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:19,353
I'm afraid of so many things,
darkness, disappearing, death.

526
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,519
Isn't it funny
that I should be afraid of death-

527
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,110
- when I put so many people
to sleep every <i>day?</i>

528
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:37,230
When I was a child, we used to rent
a house in the country for the summer.

529
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,274
I slept alone in a big room.

530
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:50,118
I remember when the Americans let off
a nuclear bomb, or was it an <i>H-bomb?</i>

531
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:56,632
The papers said that a litre of water
contains as much energy as the bomb.

532
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:00,549
The whole <i>world</i>
might become one huge fireball.

533
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:06,069
I couldn't sleep. I was so afraid.

534
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,955
Nobody could tell me what to do.

535
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,870
I've never met anyone who could
give me advice I could follow.

536
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,352
Except you...

537
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,154
sometimes.

538
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:33,438
You and I will never work out.

539
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:39,636
You're too afraid of yourself,
and everything else.

540
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:47,318
I'm not much better myself.
I've only got my work.

541
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:53,950
That's why
I want to have somebody, too.

542
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,274
I'm tired.

543
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,150
Come here.

544
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,193
Can you draw the <i>curtains?</i>

545
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,515
Come here.

546
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,755
Don't worry, I'm not after anything.

547
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,870
But supposing I <i>am?</i>

548
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,798
Let's just sleep.

549
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:08,628
<i>Did you ever read my letter?</i>
I'm sure you didn't.

550
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:16,394
<i>Did I write about the water? When I
was young, I used to swim for hours.

551
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,910
<i>The summers were much longer then.</i>

552
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,317
<i>Now they seem too short.</i>

553
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,399
<i>I never have time</i>
for summers like that.

554
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:32,754
<i>I'd still like to swim,</i>
way, way out.

555
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,078
Mummy!

556
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,068
- Hi there. Did you sleep <i>well?</i>
- Yes.

557
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,955
Helena and Veikko have gone missing.

558
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,232
- They went out to sea.
- They'll be back.

559
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:10,991
I'm so thirsty.
Can I have some water?

560
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,988
- I'll get you some.
- Thank you.

561
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,556
Here you are.

562
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,713
- Hi.
- Oh, it's you.

563
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,992
I'm glad you're here.
Mummy's missed you.

564
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,590
I spent the night at Kalle's.

565
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,510
- Are you staying here all summer?
- I wish I could but I'm too busy.

566
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,032
I'm going to lie down if you get up.

567
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,709
- Who's <i>that?</i>
- The neighbour.

568
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,230
- Hangover?
- You bet.

569
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,597
Liisa's got a good memory.

570
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,028
I'm going out.

571
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,509
Don't swim too far out!

572
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:10,549
Arvo's got a nice boat.
Why don't we go out sailing with <i>him?</i>

573
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,475
Mummy,
why don't we go out sailing with <i>him?</i>

574
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,595
It'd be nice to go out there.
I bet everything's different there.

575
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,869
- Go and change now.
- I was just going.

576
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,719
- I'll join you.
- Not now.

577
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,158
- You want some <i>coffee?</i>
- Yes.

578
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:13,437
I'll do what I like in my spare time.
It's none of your business.

579
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,871
I think you've got confused somehow.

580
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,359
- What are you <i>doing?</i>
- I'm leaving.

581
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,597
What about the two weeks' <i>notice?</i>

582
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,555
Go and plot out your lecture,
you broody old hen.

583
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,438
- You can keep your bag.
- Helena!

584
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,396
Veikko!

585
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,680
There you go.

586
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,678
What about <i>your pay?</i>
You'll need money.

587
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,589
Go and get it then if you have any.

588
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,956
Have you quarrelled with Anna <i>again?</i>

589
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,914
- Why are you carrying a <i>bag?</i>
- I quit.

590
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,796
- You promised to come to town with me.
- What's the <i>rush?</i>

591
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,315
- At least I'm not stingy.
- Thanks.

592
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,356
- I'm off, then.
- Tell me why.

593
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,838
No. I can't explain it.

594
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,157
You can stay in my flat
for the time being.

595
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:07,319
- I'll just go and get my things.
- Suit yourself.

596
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,517
You can have it.

597
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:56,395
- Am I disturbing <i>you?</i>
- No, I'm just writing a lecture.

598
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,673
Kalle's wife died of cancer
but Kalle says she died of boredom.

599
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,636
Go out and play for a while, dear.

600
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,957
There's just the three of us here-

601
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,869
- like on a deserted island.

602
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:21,394
Young people don't understand.

603
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,149
Except for Liisa.

604
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:36,276
You're rather attractive, actually.

605
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:43,113
I understand
why Veikko is interested in you.

606
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:50,237
But we all feel our age.

607
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:56,953
You can't cope like you could
when you were younger.

608
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:10,511
For example, I haven't been
to bed with anyone for ages.

609
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:14,030
It's partly the booze, I suppose.

610
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,552
But when my wife died,
I lost interest.

611
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:31,470
People of the deserted island.

612
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:36,754
- I'll tie up the boat.
- No need. I'm going alone.

613
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,839
- What do you <i>mean?</i>
- I'm going alone. You stay here.

614
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,431
- Anna gave me her key. I'll be fine.
- You're insane.

615
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,916
We had fun
but we have nothing in common.

616
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,112
How do you know <i>that?</i>

617
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,353
- When are you <i>coming?</i>
- In August.

618
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,831
Can I have a <i>lift?</i>

619
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,110
- Let's go fishing, Mummy.
- Can't we do that <i>tomorrow?</i>

620
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:09,233
- No.
- I don't feel well.

621
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,109
Is that Arvo's boat that's <i>turning?</i>

622
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,638
It's not turning, no.

623
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,229
Look now!

624
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,188
I can't see anything.

625
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,517
