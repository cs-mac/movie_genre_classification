1
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:16,064
Time to put the trash out.

2
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,680
That girl's moving out
and she's throwing all this away.

3
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:26,277
Look at this.

4
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,544
I'm going to keep it.

5
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:47,428
Off we go.

6
00:06:10,855 --> 00:06:15,886
FRIDAY NIGHT

7
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,119
Shall I keep it?

8
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,326
SKI CLOTHES - SCARF - GLOVES

9
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,085
SUMMER CLOTHES

10
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:33,823
I'll keep you.

11
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:48,977
There... Then this...

12
00:07:57,755 --> 00:07:59,384
That's that done.

13
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:10,157
''OUR PLACE'' - TOMORROW
FRANCOIS

14
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,908
This is Francois,
leave a message after the tone.

15
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,708
Francois, it's me.

16
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,446
Everything's ready now.

17
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:35,044
It took a bit longer than I thought.

18
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:37,918
I'm having dinner at Bernard and Marie's.

19
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:40,083
I can't wait to be at your place...

20
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:43,858
Our place, I mean. I have to get used to that.

21
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:48,665
Take care. See you tomorrow.

22
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,829
I'm tired, I don't know why.

23
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,179
Our place...

24
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:05,946
Our place.

25
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,343
FOR SALE - URGENT - MOVING

26
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,749
How much?

27
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,897
How much do you want for it?

28
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:11,096
- 15,000 francs.
- Are you crazy?

29
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:20,411
Poor little car...

30
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:35,622
The latest traffic news,
or rather, traffic-jam news.

31
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:39,632
Paris is at a standstill
due to the public-transport strike.

32
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:41,757
You all know that now.

33
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:44,460
The city is choking, everyone is exhausted.

34
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:47,504
I'll never get there.

35
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:50,507
At times like this, we need to be...

36
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:52,599
charitable towards others.

37
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,472
Try carpooling.

38
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:57,173
If you see cold and weary people
hitching a ride...

39
00:15:57,245 --> 00:16:00,685
take them part of the way
with you in your car.

40
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:03,243
Try it. I did it once, it was fun.

41
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:18,324
Excuse me...

42
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:22,397
I can give you a lift, if you want.

43
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,043
No thanks, I'd rather walk, it's quicker.

44
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,411
CHARITY SHOP CLOTHES

45
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,396
I'll keep this.

46
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:02,048
Okay!

47
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:45,226
- Yes?
- Good evening. Can I get in?

48
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:46,860
Yes, of course.

49
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:08,217
I didn't hear where you want to go.

50
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,517
Leave me where you want.

51
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,068
It's warm in here.

52
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,272
- Shall I turn it down?
- No, it's okay.

53
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,106
Are you all right?

54
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:46,747
Are you sure you're all right?

55
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,720
I think I dozed off for a second.

56
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:54,725
Never mind.
Fancy a cigarette to wake you up?

57
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:57,920
I've given up but I don't mind if you smoke.

58
00:25:02,198 --> 00:25:04,533
Black is black. No hope in sight.

59
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:07,333
Paris is at a standstill and you're stuck...

60
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:10,136
for the evening, tonight and tomorrow.

61
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:12,838
If you've been invited to dinner,
it's going to get cold.

62
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:21,917
I can leave you here.
You'll go more quickly on foot.

63
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:23,812
I'm in no hurry.

64
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:26,885
You can leave me wherever it suits you.

65
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:37,793
My name's Laure.

66
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:39,728
I'm Jean.

67
00:27:58,766 --> 00:27:59,927
Sorry.

68
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:13,274
The traffic situation is worse than usual.

69
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:15,408
It's as hard as ever getting anywhere...

70
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:34,966
In theory, I turn here.

71
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:37,370
In theory, but it won't be easy.

72
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,252
Try it.

73
00:28:57,858 --> 00:28:59,292
Thank you.

74
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:17,142
We're almost there.

75
00:29:18,343 --> 00:29:19,368
Well done.

76
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:32,891
I'm eating with some friends.
Do you want to come?

77
00:29:32,956 --> 00:29:34,289
All right.

78
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:56,915
No smoking, please, because of the baby.

79
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,077
Sorry.

80
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,327
You've changed your mind?

81
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:22,264
Yes, a shortcut.

82
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:57,401
Shall we have dinner together?

83
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,898
Yes.

84
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:15,518
Why didn't you let me through?

85
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:18,958
Stop yelling. You're the maniac here.

86
00:31:19,058 --> 00:31:21,860
- There was no room!
- A maniac, period.

87
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:25,093
- There was room but you moved!
- You saw I was moving!

88
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:26,358
I had the right-of-way anyhow.

89
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:29,926
What the hell's this right-of-way shit?

90
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:32,303
Let's fill out the insurance form.

91
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:34,534
Fuck you and your shit form!

92
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,035
- Fucking pain in the ass!
- What?

93
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:39,136
- Did you hear that?
- Shut it.

94
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,305
- Fuck your crate to hell!
- My car!

95
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:43,076
Fucking hell!

96
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:48,051
My car's a wreck! Don't make it worse!

97
00:31:54,457 --> 00:31:56,792
I'll make a quick phone call.

98
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:01,091
Stop it!

99
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:02,724
Fuck his crate!

100
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:05,704
The guy's hysterical!

101
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:08,008
Do something!

102
00:32:10,306 --> 00:32:11,706
You asshole!

103
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:14,406
Fuck you!

104
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:16,514
Get off him!

105
00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:20,281
- Do something!
- I'll kill you!

106
00:32:20,883 --> 00:32:22,979
I'll kill you, you hear me?

107
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,655
Take your insurance papers,
you goddamn lunatic!

108
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:30,757
Do something. They'll kill each other.

109
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,662
Laure, get yourself a bloody cell phone!

110
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:39,733
No one can come because of the strike.
It's all off.

111
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:40,963
Come over anyway.

112
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:43,735
Come over. You've nothing left at home.

113
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:45,903
We'll fix something.

114
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:47,307
That way, you'll get to see the baby.

115
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:50,246
No thanks. I've been packing boxes all day.

116
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:53,011
I'm worn out. The removal men come at 8:00.

117
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,642
I can't take the car anywhere tonight.

118
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:59,884
It's hell. Know what happened
to Bernard when he left the office?

119
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:02,983
I have to go. Other people want the phone.

120
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:05,722
I'll call you tomorrow.

121
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:08,423
Take care. Give Francois my love.

122
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,093
Just a second, Lulu.

123
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:13,031
Stop crying now, okay?

124
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:24,403
Shit, my car!

125
00:33:25,512 --> 00:33:26,707
My car!

126
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:29,708
Shit!

127
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:36,256
Excuse me...

128
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:39,694
Have you seen my car? It was just here.

129
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,953
In front of me?

130
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:43,964
And you can't find it. It must've flown off.

131
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:48,698
I shouldn't have left the keys.

132
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:51,898
Why did I leave him my car?

133
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:53,530
Here you write Mr...

134
00:33:53,605 --> 00:33:55,734
I can't, there's not enough room.

135
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,253
It doesn't matter.

136
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:28,365
I'm not cold.

137
00:34:30,674 --> 00:34:33,874
It doesn't matter. Never mind.

138
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:36,604
I'm not cold.

139
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:02,006
Where are you going?

140
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:04,036
Come on.

141
00:35:04,707 --> 00:35:07,577
I thought you'd seen me but you vanished.

142
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:09,974
You don't leave a car like that.

143
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:12,277
Get in. We'll try something.

144
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:30,041
Stop. I want to get out.

145
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:31,637
- What's wrong?
- Let me go.

146
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:33,046
- What's wrong?
- Let go of me.

147
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:36,087
- I want to go. I want to go home.
-Calm down.

148
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,415
It's your car, so I'll get out and go.

149
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:52,999
Good night.

150
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:32,810
- Careful, you'll get into tilt.
- Shit.

151
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:34,607
- What's tilt?
- Sorry?

152
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,845
- What's tilt?
- When you shake it too much.

153
00:41:44,486 --> 00:41:46,011
Try a little...

154
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:50,857
Then catch the ball.

155
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,134
Good evening.

156
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:13,177
Coffee.

157
00:42:14,017 --> 00:42:15,781
Two coffees, please.

158
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:21,082
Okay?

159
00:42:44,177 --> 00:42:46,170
- You scalded yourself?
- Yes.

160
00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:48,544
Because it's hot.

161
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,485
We're in no hurry. We have time.

162
00:42:55,454 --> 00:42:58,255
Plenty of time. Want a glass of water?

163
00:42:59,258 --> 00:43:02,230
Could we have a glass of water, please?

164
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,476
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

165
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:18,805
Uh-huh...

166
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:30,951
I'll be right back.

167
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,761
Do you have any 10-franc coins?

168
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:13,689
I was going to phone, too.

169
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,413
THE MACHINE ONLY TAKES CARDS

170
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,751
4 SUPER MANIX CONDOMS = 10 F

171
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:40,923
PUSH ALL THE WAY IN

172
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:32,967
Come on, let's walk.

173
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,385
Good evening.

174
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,757
Anyone here?

175
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:58,901
- Do you have any rooms?
- All you want. We're empty.

176
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,869
We put the sign up for people
stuck in the strike.

177
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,134
But it hasn't worked.

178
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,472
SPECIAL STRIKE RATES

179
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:13,611
Could you pay me now, please?

180
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,417
No, let me.

181
00:49:15,518 --> 00:49:17,784
- I'm all alone so...
- How much?

182
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,220
200 francs.

183
00:49:22,457 --> 00:49:23,652
Second floor.

184
00:49:23,725 --> 00:49:26,423
You'll see a sign for the showers and toilet.

185
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:34,002
Good night.

186
00:59:45,217 --> 00:59:47,245
Your hand smells of rubber.

187
01:00:16,548 --> 01:00:18,575
You've got a blister here.

188
01:00:20,753 --> 01:00:22,552
Is that why you got into my car?

189
01:00:23,322 --> 01:00:24,482
Maybe.

190
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,757
I'm hungry. Want to eat?

191
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:40,466
Let's have dinner.

192
01:01:04,896 --> 01:01:06,762
This is the door code.

193
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:09,559
I forgot to give it to you.

194
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:12,825
Lucky I heard you
or you'd have been locked out.

195
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:14,371
You're right.

196
01:01:29,051 --> 01:01:31,021
If we find nothing, we can go back.

197
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,055
We'll find something.

198
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:57,236
Could you choose quickly?
The chef leaves soon.

199
01:01:58,444 --> 01:02:02,749
Usually we close late on Fridays
but with the strike...

200
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,418
I'm cold. Can we switch tables?

201
01:02:08,087 --> 01:02:10,819
- Can we switch tables?
- Yes, of course.

202
01:02:11,758 --> 01:02:13,489
Does this suit you?

203
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,242
What do you want?

204
01:02:34,881 --> 01:02:37,283
I don't know yet. What about you?

205
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:41,852
I'll have the antipasto
and then a Neapolitan pizza.

206
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:44,148
Me too.

207
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:45,850
White wine, okay?

208
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:48,253
A carafe of white, thank you.

209
01:03:44,948 --> 01:03:46,473
You're welcome.

210
01:03:49,685 --> 01:03:53,283
My feet are killing me. I've had enough.

211
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,786
Your coat.

212
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,923
- I'm sick of walking.
- It does you good.

213
01:04:00,161 --> 01:04:02,961
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

214
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:30,978
Maybe something's happened to her.

215
01:05:33,785 --> 01:05:36,415
Nothing can happen. Her husband's here.

216
01:05:37,554 --> 01:05:39,080
Someone should check.

217
01:05:45,828 --> 01:05:47,161
Excuse me...

218
01:05:48,831 --> 01:05:51,496
could I have another carafe of wine?

219
01:06:51,225 --> 01:06:53,625
What are you thinking of? Me?

220
01:07:20,418 --> 01:07:22,150
Careful, the plate's hot.

221
01:07:44,774 --> 01:07:47,372
I'll have the same spaghetti, please.

222
01:08:23,346 --> 01:08:24,973
Are you coming?

223
01:08:33,688 --> 01:08:35,716
How will you get home, Pierre?

224
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:37,693
My car's parked nearby.

225
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,285
That's good.

226
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:44,597
Etienne, put your hood up.

227
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:47,297
- It's cold outside.
- It's a very cold night.

228
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:23,462
FRI

229
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:26,637
SAT

230
01:10:38,242 --> 01:10:40,212
Shall I turn the heater off?

231
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:41,711
Yes, it's stifling.

232
01:10:41,778 --> 01:10:44,110
- What?
- It's stifling in here.

233
01:12:04,222 --> 01:12:06,283
I need a drink of water.

234
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,053
Jean!

235
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,190
Jean.
