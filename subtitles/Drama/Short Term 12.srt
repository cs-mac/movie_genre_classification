1
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,666
Don't worry about it.

2
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,266
On... on my first day, I forgot
everything that they taught me

3
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:38,266
in those classes.

4
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:39,333
Really?

5
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,600
Yeah.

6
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,399
I mean, day one's always
a little tough.

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,066
It's like, you know, no matter
how the training goes,

8
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,833
there's... there's always room
for something that's just

9
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,867
totally unpredictable.

10
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:49,166
Oh, I...

11
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:50,333
I've got a pretty good
story for you if

12
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:51,333
you're ready for it.

13
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:52,600
OK.

14
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:53,766
Hey, what's up?

15
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,099
Hey.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,066
Did you guys meet?

17
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:56,766
No.

18
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:57,700
Nate.

19
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:58,800
Hi.

20
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,900
Hey.

21
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,166
Jessica.

22
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,666
OK, listen up.

23
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,399
So it's like my first week
on the job, and I'm

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,500
at gate duty, right?

25
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,366
What's that?

26
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,066
If a kid wants to leave,
legally we can't stop them, so

27
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,466
we put someone at the gate to
try and talk them out of it.

28
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:12,867
Whoa, you got here quick.

29
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:13,800
I did.

30
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:14,867
Good morning.

31
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:15,833
Hi.

32
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:16,766
Nate, this is Grace.

33
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:17,234
She's your new boss.

34
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:17,933
Hello.

35
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:18,900
Hey.

36
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:19,800
Hi, nice to meet you.

37
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:21,132
Nice to meet you.

38
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,800
I would lose the tie
if I were you.

39
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,333
And if you're listening to a
story of Mason's, understand

40
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,999
that there's very little
reality in it.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,199
Hey, don't piss in the water
before we put our toes in.

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,766
It actually feels
pretty mellow.

43
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:33,066
OK, so Grace,
my wonderful new boss

44
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:36,600
at the time, she leaves me at
my gate duty for like three

45
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:38,433
hours without a bathroom break.

46
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:41,132
And I'm dying because I ate
the tacos that they serve

47
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,933
here, and she failed
to tell me that

48
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,466
they're a known laxative.

49
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:48,766
So this kid, 16 years old, this
big fuckin' intimidating

50
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,633
dude, he's like a foot
taller than me.

51
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:53,867
He walks up and he just
cruises out the gate.

52
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:56,366
It's my second day, so
I don't know what the

53
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:57,900
hell is going on.

54
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,032
But Grace, she's standing
right there, and she

55
00:01:59,033 --> 00:01:59,999
just lets it happen.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
Whatever.

57
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,900
What I saw was Mason just
sitting there and Wesley

58
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:04,600
smiling at me from the opposite
side of the gate

59
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,566
because he knows that
we can't touch him.

60
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,999
Why not?

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,867
Once they're a foot outside the
gate, we can't touch them.

62
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,999
So Grace tells me to follow
him, so I do for hours, just

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,933
walking eight feet behind him.

64
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:18,967
Eventually he gets on this bus,
so I get on the bus too.

65
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:21,800
And at this point I can't think
of anything but whatever

66
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,733
the hell these tacos are
doing to my bowels.

67
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:26,700
So I make up my mind,
fuck this.

68
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,700
I've got to get off at the next
stop or I'm going to lose

69
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:30,500
it in my shorts in front
of all these people.

70
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:33,833
And exactly as I make this
decision, Wesley leans his

71
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,600
big-ass head over to me from
across the aisle, and he says,

72
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:40,066
really calm, I'm getting off at
the next stop, and if you

73
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:43,199
do too, I'm going to rip your
fuckin' balls off and feed

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,166
them to you.

75
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,366
Holy shit.

76
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,433
Remember what I said.

77
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,867
Hey now, this part is true.

78
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:48,600
I was there.

79
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,433
Really?

80
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:50,266
Mm-hmm.

81
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,199
Are you sure?

82
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,099
Yeah.

83
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,900
So the bus stops.

84
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:53,700
He gets off.

85
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,066
I wait a second.

86
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,900
I go over to the door, but he's
just standing there on

87
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,700
the sidewalk like 10 feet away,
staring at me, waiting.

88
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:00,433
What can I do?

89
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:01,399
I have no other choice.

90
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,233
So I step off the bus.

91
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:06,633
And the second that my feet
touch the ground, it is like a

92
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:11,266
knot in my asshole untied, and
the fiesta in my stomach just

93
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,099
comes pouring down my legs.

94
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:19,500
So I'm just standing there,
shit gushing down my thighs.

95
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:21,867
I ruined my fuckin'
favorite Nikes.

96
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,433
And Wesley is just there,
doubled over, losing it.

97
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,466
And he's fuckin' laughing
so hard.

98
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:28,700
I've never seen anything...

99
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,166
Here we go, Nate.

100
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,399
Wait, what?

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,099
Come on, Nate!

102
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,766
Go.

103
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:37,933
Sammy!

104
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:40,900
Sammy!

105
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,867
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

106
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:42,900
Hey.

107
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:44,199
Whoa, I got him.

108
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,299
Let go, you fucking perverts!

109
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,399
OK.

110
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,600
Nate, grab his feet, please.

111
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,166
Just going to sit down here in
the grass for a while until

112
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,533
you de-escalate.

113
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,199
Deescalate my asshole,
you duck fuckers!

114
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,299
I'm not quite sure what
you mean by that.

115
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,266
You know the drill, Sammy.

116
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:57,999
Just let it pass.

117
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:07,867
You all right, buddy?

118
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:10,299
Whoa, he got pretty
far that time.

119
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,933
I think it's a new record.

120
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:17,700
So anyway, after all that he
ends up coming back with me,

121
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,867
but only because he's so excited
to tell everyone in

122
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,333
our unit that I pooped
my pants.

123
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,500
And he does.

124
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:23,766
He tells everyone.

125
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,700
Somehow it even got
back to my mom.

126
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:29,299
You heard that story,
right Sammy?

127
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,566
Yeah.

128
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,066
How are you guys doing
over there?

129
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,132
Fantastic.

130
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,066
How are you feeling, Sammy?

131
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,333
You got it all out?

132
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,366
You want to go take a nap?

133
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:39,867
All right, let's get you up.

134
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,900
Up we go, bud.

135
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:44,099
All right, I'll see you
back at the office.

136
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,533
Man.

137
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,334
All right.

138
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:53,700
This guy's been eating his
Wheaties in the morning.

139
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,900
Have you ever thought about
the Olympics, Sammy?

140
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,867
Running track?

141
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,933
These are the files on our
kids, if you want to see what

142
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:32,533
kind of crap they've
been through.

143
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,233
How long do they stay here?

144
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:36,333
Supposedly less than a year,
but we have a few that have

145
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:37,867
been here a little over three.

146
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:39,733
We just keep them until the
county figures out where

147
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,299
they're going to go next.

148
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,433
Tom!

149
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,433
Go brush your teeth!

150
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:47,967
Mmm.

151
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,233
Remember, you are
not their parent.

152
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:50,933
You are not their therapist.

153
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:52,833
You are here to create a safe
environment, and that's it.

154
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,366
Got it.

155
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:55,633
And since you're new, they're
going to try and test you, see

156
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:56,700
what they can get away with.

157
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:59,299
So just say no for a while.

158
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,800
No.

159
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,999
OK.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,132
Kind of got to be an
asshole before you

161
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:04,133
can be their friend.

162
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:08,666
You're going to be fine.

163
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:11,199
Community meeting is
in five minutes!

164
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,633
Luis, you better be up.

165
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,534
Ugh, I don't want to be.

166
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,633
So this is how it's
going to be?

167
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:26,066
You've got five seconds.

168
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:32,366
Fuck!

169
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,299
Aah!

170
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,333
Aah!

171
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:36,266
Luis!

172
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,333
I love you too.

173
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,133
That's not cool.

174
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,266
Kendra, will you be secretary
for us today?

175
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,566
Sure, I guess.

176
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,266
OK, thank you.

177
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:10,399
Community meeting is
now in session.

178
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
Community announcements?

179
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:16,299
No announcements?

180
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,900
What's going on, you guys?

181
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:21,333
You look a little dead.

182
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,366
What did you do to them?

183
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,533
I don't know.

184
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:25,766
I farted when I was outside.

185
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,633
Maybe some of it
followed me in.

186
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:29,166
Did you shart yourself again?

187
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:32,633
No, Luis, I did not shart,
thank you very much.

188
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:35,366
And that happened one time,
and you weren't

189
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,633
even here yet, so.

190
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:37,666
It's still funny.

191
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,633
OK, are we done?

192
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,099
I've...

193
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,399
I've heard that story like
three times today.

194
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,366
Yeah, but it's a good story.

195
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:43,666
It is a good story.

196
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,666
OK, if no one has any
non-poop related

197
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,566
announcements, I have one.

198
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:51,266
As most of you are already
aware, Marcus is turning 18

199
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,800
and will be leaving us.

200
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,333
Can I have his room?

201
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,466
We are going
to be throwing him a

202
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:56,900
little party next week.

203
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:58,734
Marcus, any requests?

204
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,800
Can I shave my head?

205
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,600
I was talking about
food for the party.

206
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:07,500
No, I don't.

207
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:09,633
I don't want food.

208
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,667
I want to shave my head.

209
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,299
OK.

210
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,399
As long as I hold the razor.

211
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,900
Cool.

212
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,399
OK, everyone else, thoughts?

213
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,766
Food for Marcus' party, what
are we going to do?

214
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,533
OK, OK.

215
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:32,032
Everyone, one at
a time, please.

216
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,933
Luis, thank you for
raising your hand.

217
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,933
Who's the weird guy over there?

218
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:38,433
Oh, that is Nate.

219
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:40,366
Please do not be jerks to him.

220
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,666
It is his first day.

221
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,399
Do you want to introduce
yourself?

222
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,433
Um, sure.

223
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:46,500
Great.

224
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:47,166
Yeah.

225
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,099
Hey.

226
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,333
Uh, as you know,
my name's Nate.

227
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:51,967
And, uh, I just...

228
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,967
I took a year off of school
because, you know, I just

229
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,132
wanted to get some
life experience.

230
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:58,999
And I always wanted to work
with underprivileged kids.

231
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,666
Hey, what the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

232
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,032
Marcus, settle down.

233
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,299
No, I want to know what
you mean by that,

234
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,800
"underprivileged."

235
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,366
That's not what I meant.

236
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,633
Then think about your fucking
words before you speak!

237
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:11,466
Hey!

238
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,433
Newbie!

239
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:13,233
That's a level drop.

240
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,300
Go to your room.

241
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:20,234
Go to your room.

242
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:24,901
Sorry, man.

243
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,767
Sorry.

244
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:35,533
Um, levels and feelings,
you know the drill.

245
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,399
Let's start with you, Luis.

246
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,533
Green.

247
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:39,633
Fine.

248
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:40,399
Silver.

249
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,533
Whatever.

250
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:42,500
Yellow.

251
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,833
I feel funny.

252
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:44,600
Green.

253
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:45,700
All right.

254
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:46,366
Yellow.

255
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,366
Annoyed.

256
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:53,367
Short Term 12, this is Grace.

257
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
Right now?

258
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:03,166
So what do you think?

259
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:03,800
Hmm?

260
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,666
The new lamp.

261
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,233
It's really a trip.

262
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,433
You can turn it on and off by
touching the metal part.

263
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,234
Try it.

264
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:19,566
Cool, huh?

265
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,299
Hmm.

266
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,933
Look, I'm supposed to be in a
group session like right now.

267
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,399
You mind if we walk and talk?

268
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,500
No.

269
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:27,933
This is Jayden.

270
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:30,199
She just got appointed
to us this morning.

271
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,600
Her father's a friend
of a friend, real

272
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,433
nice guy, very cultured.

273
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,399
Why isn't she with him?

274
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,099
Oh, he lost his wife
a few years back.

275
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,833
Jayden hasn't made life
very easy on him.

276
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,066
For the past couple of years,
she's been in and out of group

277
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:47,132
homes for dangerous behavior.

278
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:50,399
Last week she bit her
therapist's nose.

279
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,766
Great.

280
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,600
Yeah, so we'll have her during
the week, but she gets

281
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:56,333
weekend home visits.

282
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:57,566
All right.

283
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,700
I told her father we'd
take good care of her.

284
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,433
I take good care of everyone.

285
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:02,999
I know you do.

286
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,400
That's why I'm trusting you to
do the same with Jayden.

287
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,500
When does she get here?

288
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:11,901
She might be here already.

289
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:25,700
I like your name, Jayden.

290
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,666
It's a boy's name.

291
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,333
Really?

292
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,633
I don't think so.

293
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,267
Will Smith did.

294
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,333
OK, well, these things you
can't keep in your room, but

295
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,132
we'll keep them in the closet
out here, and you can check

296
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,666
them out whenever
you want them.

297
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,233
Yep, I know the rules.

298
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:45,566
No belts, no razors, no
scissors, no fuckin' freedom.

299
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,366
No cussing.

300
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,400
Shit, I forgot about that one.

301
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,299
I'm going to let that one slip
because it was clever.

302
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,032
All right.

303
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,234
Let's go see your room.

304
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:01,700
Here it is.

305
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:04,166
Wow, it's so inviting.

306
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,633
You can put whatever you want
on the walls as long as it's

307
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:07,867
appropriate.

308
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:10,066
So no pictures of penises?

309
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:14,500
Not unless it's very
scientific.

310
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,433
Oh, wow.

311
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:17,999
This is really cool.

312
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,366
No, that's crap.

313
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,934
If you call that crap,
I'm jealous.

314
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,399
If you put your clothes outside
the door before

315
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,433
bedtime, the overnighters
will wash them.

316
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:38,666
And, um, you can't keep
your door closest.

317
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,166
I don't do that anymore.

318
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,733
I'm not saying that you do.

319
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,333
I mean, even if I ever did want
to cut myself, keeping

320
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:44,867
the fuckin' door cracked
isn't going to stop me.

321
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,166
I already warned you
about cussing.

322
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,700
That one's going to
be a level drop.

323
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,733
Oh no, a level drop.

324
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:51,700
What am I going to do?

325
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:55,000
Your attitude is not helping
either one of us.

326
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:31,733
Hey, what happened to that guy?

327
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:33,166
What guy?

328
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,366
The big kid that made
you poop your pants.

329
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,233
Wesley.

330
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:37,566
Yeah.

331
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,700
He ran away again, and then two
days later someone found

332
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:41,766
him dead in the bushes.

333
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,066
What?

334
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,900
That is the real ending
to the story.

335
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:48,566
I don't like that part.

336
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:49,766
Sugar, coming with me?

337
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,032
I'm going to clear my head.

338
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,700
That was a good first
day, Nate.

339
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:54,500
Thank you.

340
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,099
See ya.

341
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,032
All right, man.

342
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:58,833
Yeah, take it easy.

343
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,766
All right.

344
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:01,033
I'll see you tomorrow.

345
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,533
Grace?

346
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:22,133
Come on in, Hon.

347
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:31,200
So the test did come
back positive.

348
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:34,800
Lovely.

349
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,601
How are you feeling?

350
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:42,867
I already did, like, seven of
those tests at home, so I'm

351
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:45,299
not really surprised.

352
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,366
OK, well, you have a few
options to explore.

353
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,800
And we can go over it for...

354
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:52,600
We can just make an appointment
for Saturday.

355
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,968
You don't want to hear
the other options?

356
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,501
Uhuh.

357
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,968
OK.

358
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,601
Have you ever been
pregnant before?

359
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:18,299
One time.

360
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,100
OK.

361
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,600
Hey, stinker, what
took you so long?

362
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:38,800
Oh, no.

363
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:40,633
I didn't know you still
had that stupid hat.

364
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,833
I will always have
this stupid hat.

365
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,500
What's going on in here?

366
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:46,766
Well, since you were out
cheating on me with your bike,

367
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,666
I decided I'd make myself some
chiles rellenos, homemade

368
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,032
tortillas, and my mom's
famous salsa.

369
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:53,266
Mmm.

370
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:54,766
Looks like there's
enough for two.

371
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:55,700
All right.

372
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:57,099
I doubt it.

373
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,533
Mase, you don't have to
be jealous of Floyd.

374
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:01,366
Floyd?

375
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,399
Your bike has a name now?

376
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,299
Of course he does.

377
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,766
We're very close.

378
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,800
I don't know what
you see in him.

379
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:07,666
Mmm.

380
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,533
Nice grip.

381
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:09,833
Comfy seat.

382
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:13,299
There is no way his seat
is as comfy as mine.

383
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,666
You're right.

384
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,833
I think I'm going to
go take a shower.

385
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,566
Floyd got me all sweaty.

386
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:21,800
I hate that bike!

387
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,400
Fuck you, Floyd.

388
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:37,999
OK, I'm done with mine.

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,666
Oh, yeah.

390
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,032
OK, yep.

391
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,766
Almost there.

392
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,299
Um.

393
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,233
Those are some crazy
last-minute changes you're

394
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,566
making.

395
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,099
Yeah, well, I really
suck at noses.

396
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,067
OK, you go first.

397
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:59,399
Aw, damn it.

398
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,633
Yours are always so good.

399
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:02,700
Thanks.

400
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,266
I look like a homeless
guy, though.

401
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:05,833
You do kind of look like
a homeless guy.

402
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,900
Oh yeah, thank you.

403
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:09,600
What's that on my face there?

404
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:10,566
Oh, that?

405
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:11,067
Yep.

406
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:12,733
Mmm.

407
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:14,166
Well, that's the piece of
avocado that's in your beard.

408
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:14,900
No.

409
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:15,666
Yes.

410
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,500
Oh, fuck.

411
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:17,566
Yes.

412
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:18,566
It's been there the whole time.

413
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,600
Ooh, yeah.

414
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,099
So now you're all
nicely painted.

415
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,800
Thank you for saying
something...

416
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:22,267
sooner.

417
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:22,933
I did.

418
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:24,700
I just...

419
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:25,533
OK.

420
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:27,266
Um, all right, here we go.

421
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,032
Just take it easy, OK, because
you're going to freak out when

422
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:30,299
you see this.

423
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,999
I think it might be
my best one yet.

424
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,900
OK.

425
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:37,766
Hmm?

426
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:39,099
Come on.

427
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,132
Oh, wow.

428
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,199
You can't fuck with that.

429
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,867
I can't fuck with that.

430
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:46,266
That nose is amazing.

431
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,933
Yeah.

432
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,399
And I was going for kind of a
mushroomy thing in there.

433
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,833
Is that a beard?

434
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:52,633
No.

435
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:54,199
I was, uh...

436
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,633
I was trying to shade.

437
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,900
I think it looks pretty cool.

438
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,900
Yeah, it looks very cool.

439
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:00,333
What's growing out of my head?

440
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:01,700
Oh, these?

441
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:02,200
Flowers.

442
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:03,900
Mmm.

443
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,066
They represent the peculiar
thoughts that grow out of your

444
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,667
gorgeous mind.

445
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,634
Why are you so nice to me?

446
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,833
You being serious now?

447
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,099
Mmhmm.

448
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,500
Well, it's easy.

449
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:27,633
It's because you are the
weirdest, most beautiful

450
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:31,334
person that I've ever met
in my whole entire life.

451
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:49,933
Whoa.

452
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:50,933
Hmm?

453
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:52,533
Um.

454
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:53,867
Nothing.

455
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:57,099
It's just been a long time since
you kissed me like that.

456
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,999
That's not true.

457
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,567
Well, we haven't had sex
in 9 days and 13 hours.

458
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:10,967
Down to the hour, huh?

459
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,567
Did I do something?

460
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:16,299
No.

461
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,867
You're wonderful.

462
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,467
What is it, then?

463
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:25,299
Hey.

464
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,933
Hey, hey.

465
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:30,066
Please, you have to let me in
your head once in a while or

466
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,633
I'm just going to go nuts, OK?

467
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:33,234
Shh.

468
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:50,934
Are you doing this just for me?

469
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:56,299
You OK?

470
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,999
Yes.

471
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,501
Yeah?

472
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:04,834
You don't want me to stop?

473
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,199
Stop.

474
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,900
Why?

475
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:22,367
Stop!

476
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,800
Ow!

477
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:26,434
Shit.

478
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,467
What the hell, Grace?

479
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
OK, everyone.

480
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:25,399
I think most of you have already
met her, but we have a

481
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,833
new member of our community.

482
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:30,066
Jayden, would you introduce
yourself?

483
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:31,700
Um.

484
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:34,967
Please don't be offended if I'm
not very friendly, but I'm

485
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:37,833
going to be living with my dad
soon, and I don't really like

486
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,833
wasting time on short-term
relationships.

487
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:43,867
So, you know, it's
nothing personal.

488
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:44,900
Wow.

489
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:46,566
She seems like a really
nice girl.

490
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,233
Hey, I think we all can

491
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,867
respect her space, OK?

492
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,299
OK, what do we want to
play for rec today?

493
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,333
Wiffle ball, dude!

494
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:54,233
OK.

495
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:55,633
No, man.

496
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:56,933
You're always playing
that stupid game.

497
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:58,533
Because you always suck at it.

498
00:22:58,534 --> 00:22:59,833
Until you get good at
it, maybe we could

499
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:00,600
stop playing it.

500
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:01,999
Watch your mouth, bro.

501
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,233
Both of you, cut it out.

502
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:04,834
Any other suggestions?

503
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,266
Yes, Sammy?

504
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:10,032
Can we play Big and Small?

505
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:13,466
Is that a real game, or is that
a game you just made up?

506
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,533
It's a real game that
I just made up.

507
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,867
OK.

508
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:21,834
Well, maybe you can explain
that to me later.

509
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,600
Straight line, guys.

510
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:31,199
I'm going to do room checks,
so I'll meet you.

511
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,601
Oh, OK.

512
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:34,734
Hi, Nas.

513
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,399
Come on, guys.

514
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,132
Let's go, Shawnta, let's go!

515
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,766
All right, we got
a baseball game.

516
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,333
There you go.

517
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:06,366
You got this.

518
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:09,399
Sammy.

519
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,333
Hey, yo, Sammy.

520
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:11,533
Get... get the ball!

521
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:13,132
Run, girl, run!

522
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,133
Come on, Sammy!

523
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:20,633
You too good for this game?

524
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:21,933
What?

525
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:25,333
Too good for wiffle ball?

526
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:28,032
I don't like sweat.

527
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,399
Hey, you know what, Connor?

528
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,500
Just come... just come closer.

529
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:31,533
It's Marcus.

530
00:25:31,534 --> 00:25:32,933
He ain't going to hit it.

531
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:34,199
You sure you don't want
to get the fat bat?

532
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,601
No?

533
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,600
Strike one, everybody.

534
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:39,533
Strike one.

535
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:40,800
That wasn't no strike.

536
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:41,933
That was right down the middle.

537
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:42,900
This is the big leagues, boy.

538
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,999
You can't handle it?

539
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,166
Better keep flapping them gums.

540
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,066
Hey.

541
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,099
You want to jump rope with us?

542
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,500
Um.

543
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:55,300
No?

544
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,433
Sorry.

545
00:25:58,434 --> 00:25:59,834
We're not supposed to.

546
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,633
That's not what we meant.

547
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:05,634
Can I hear?

548
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:29,633
Strike three.

549
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,266
Change it up.

550
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:33,667
Bet your ma is real excited
to see you next week, huh?

551
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,800
Marcus!

552
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:39,733
What the fuck?

553
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,366
Hey!

554
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:42,399
What the fuck did you about
my mama, you little bitch?

555
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,066
Hey!

556
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:43,800
Hey!

557
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:45,066
What are you doing?

558
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,600
Get your ass over to the bench.

559
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:47,666
Come on, come on.

560
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:48,933
Guys, get Luis out of here.

561
00:26:48,934 --> 00:26:49,700
Is Marcus OK?

562
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:50,500
You good?

563
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:51,299
Yeah, I got it.

564
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,967
Luis, come on.

565
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:53,266
Come on.

566
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:54,566
OK, where... where where...
where does it hurt?

567
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:55,500
Come on.

568
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,032
Come on, sit over here.

569
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:57,833
We're going to sit down for
a little while, OK?

570
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:58,633
You OK, man?

571
00:26:58,634 --> 00:26:59,433
How do you feel?

572
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:00,533
Not good.

573
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:01,666
I mean, that... that was crazy.

574
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:04,233
They just fight like that?

575
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:09,533
Nate, I'm not asking you
how you're feeling.

576
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:10,299
Right.

577
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,566
I'm sorry.

578
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,367
How are you?

579
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,767
You need to tell me what
the hell is going on.

580
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:44,099
Assault and drug possession.

581
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,566
You realize that's enough to get
your ass thrown in juvie.

582
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:49,032
Do you think I give a fuck?

583
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,200
You're out of here in
less than a week.

584
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,834
You're so much smarter
than this.

585
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,600
I know it's scary out there.

586
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,700
I ain't scared of shit.

587
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:09,399
All I'm saying is, getting
thrown in jail is not what you

588
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,801
want to do.

589
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,868
My dad has been in there
for 10 years.

590
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,868
I don't want that for you.

591
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:46,833
Straight to your room.

592
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:47,800
No free time until all

593
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:49,133
your chores are done.

594
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,700
What's going on with him?

595
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:56,501
He doesn't want to leave.

596
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:01,566
Should I go talk to him?

597
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,566
Yeah.

598
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,399
All right, I'll just be inside
letting Marcus kick the

599
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,299
shit out of me.

600
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,901
Have fun.

601
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:22,767
You got some new lyrics you
want to try out on me?

602
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:28,999
There's a lot of fucks in it.

603
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,801
I won't tell.

604
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:36,999
Mm-hmm.

605
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,199
Those are pretty much it.

606
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,967
It's slow.

607
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:41,066
All right, let's see.

608
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:42,868
Let's see here.

609
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,533
Like that?

610
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:51,633
Yeah.

611
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:54,132
All right.

612
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,600
It don't matter
now, damn near 18.

613
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:59,900
All the pretty pictures in
my fuckin' head is faded.

614
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:03,099
And when I think about that
trick that raised me, I think

615
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,600
about sick, because the
bitch is crazy.

616
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,166
Fuck that bitch, nigga,
fuck that pain.

617
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,399
Your body's in a ditch inside
this turned up brain.

618
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,299
I mean, I can't see how you
claim it, you being ma?

619
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,833
Doctors snatched me out
the snatch of pure

620
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:16,266
evil with eagle claws.

621
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,533
Ho, ho, ho, slut, fuck
the way you want it.

622
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:21,500
Got your young, dumb son
pitching pigeons for money.

623
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:23,900
I mean, it's colder than the
bitch when it's sunny.

624
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:25,399
Blows raining down on the glow.

625
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,433
Got the nerve to tell
me you love me?

626
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:28,366
I said, again?

627
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:28,999
Again?

628
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,833
Sell it again?

629
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:31,299
Bitch, I'm 10.

630
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,600
Let me go outside and function
with friends.

631
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:33,600
You say you ma?

632
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:34,700
You mother?

633
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,099
You the father-fucking queen?

634
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,132
I say, all right, I love
her so I flip it again.

635
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:41,066
No, not this time, bitch,
because I'm stronger than you.

636
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:43,299
Not this time, bitch, swinging
harder than you.

637
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,099
No, not this time, bitch, you
ain't leave me a choice.

638
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,066
You just a body in a ditch
in the brain of a boy.

639
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,366
All fucked up now,
damn near 18.

640
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:54,600
All the pictures in my past
ain't never fading.

641
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:57,299
I'm always wishing for something
amazing, but when

642
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,800
your life is shit then
it ain't no trading.

643
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:02,633
So put me in your book so you
know what it's like to live a

644
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:05,333
life not knowing what a
normal life's like.

645
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:08,199
Put a label on my head so you
know what it's like to live a

646
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,032
life not knowing what a
normal life's like.

647
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,633
Look into my eyes so you
know what it's like.

648
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:16,266
Look into my eyes so you
know what it's like.

649
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:19,166
Look into my eyes so you know
what it's like to live a life

650
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:22,033
not knowing what a normal
life's like.

651
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:37,366
Yeah, I...

652
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:37,933
I don't...

653
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:39,032
I don't...

654
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:41,067
I don't know what to say, man.

655
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:43,200
It's cool, man.

656
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:47,267
I just need to shave my head.

657
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:52,234
You think Grace will
still shave it?

658
00:31:57,767 --> 00:31:59,400
I like the new wall decor.

659
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:05,032
Thanks.

660
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,367
They're actually very
informative.

661
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:14,934
Can I draw with you?

662
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:32,867
When I was 9 or 10, I used to
draw portraits of all my mom's

663
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,666
boyfriends.

664
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,434
And then I'd sell them to
her for $10 apiece.

665
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:43,333
How many boyfriends
did she have?

666
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:46,533
Enough that I was able to save
up and buy one of those

667
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:51,666
portable CD players with
anti-shock protection.

668
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:53,099
You're old.

669
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,032
Whatever.

670
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:55,234
Those things were cool.

671
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,200
You know what's weird?

672
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:06,700
Whenever I was drawing portraits
of, you know, those

673
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:11,733
guys, I would always
take forever.

674
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:15,566
30, 40 minutes just stringing
them along, saying, oh, I've

675
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:19,800
just got to do a couple
more shadows, or, I'm

676
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:21,400
just fixing the nose.

677
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,933
I don't know why I did that.

678
00:33:25,934 --> 00:33:28,734
I hated every single
one of them.

679
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,300
Maybe you were just trying to
keep them away from your mom.

680
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:42,167
Yeah.

681
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,300
Maybe.

682
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:51,132
Are you done?

683
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:52,500
Almost.

684
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:53,666
I've just got to add
a few shadows and

685
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,900
fix the nose a little.

686
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,867
You are such a smartass.

687
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:00,299
That's a level drop.

688
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,666
Oh no, not a level drop.

689
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,867
I wanted to play
foosball later.

690
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:07,066
Hmm.

691
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:09,467
Too bad.

692
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:41,933
OK.

693
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:44,333
Finished.

694
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,167
You want to take a look?

695
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,733
Looks great, Marcus.

696
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:54,334
Check it out.

697
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,701
Is it lumpy?

698
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,667
What do you mean?

699
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,666
I usually keep my hair long.

700
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:12,066
It's where she used
to hit me at.

701
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,667
Is it still lumpy?

702
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:19,600
No way, man.

703
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,366
Not at all.

704
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,167
See for yourself.

705
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:44,132
Pretty smooth.

706
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:46,266
What about the back?

707
00:35:46,267 --> 00:35:47,066
No scars?

708
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,900
No...

709
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:50,299
no nothing?

710
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,266
Uhuh.

711
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:52,868
It looks really great.

712
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:09,233
Mason.

713
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:10,834
Hmm?

714
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,767
I have something to tell you.

715
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:22,233
Yeah?

716
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:23,834
What's up?

717
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:36,333
We're going to have a baby.

718
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,533
What?

719
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,434
We're going to have a baby.

720
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:57,868
We are?

721
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:00,868
Mmhmm.

722
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:05,666
Whoa.

723
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,300
Whoa.

724
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,132
Whoa.

725
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:13,266
OK.

726
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:14,834
Um.

727
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,801
Um.

728
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:26,233
Um.

729
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:27,834
Uh, give me a minute.

730
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,734
Oh, boy!

731
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,766
Holy shit.

732
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,766
Whoa!

733
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:40,234
OK.

734
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:40,900
OK.

735
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,367
OK.

736
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:54,501
Hey.

737
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,801
You know we can do this, right?

738
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:06,132
Because we are going to be
some amazing parents.

739
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,734
OK?

740
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:12,067
I love you so much, Grace.

741
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:17,434
So much it's insane.

742
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,199
Let me see.

743
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,399
Hmm?

744
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,366
You can't tell yet.

745
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,367
Come on.

746
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:54,734
That is so crazy.

747
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,767
Hmm.

748
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:55,199
Did you hear about Sammy?

749
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,633
What?

750
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:59,066
Last night they took
all his dolls away.

751
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:03,633
His therapist is calling it
a lesson in letting go.

752
00:41:03,634 --> 00:41:04,867
Bullshit.

753
00:41:04,868 --> 00:41:08,466
Those are all his
sisters, right?

754
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,467
He's not ready for that.

755
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:18,534
It's time for your meds, Sammy.

756
00:41:32,634 --> 00:41:34,634
I'm sorry, bud.

757
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,767
Jayden, meds.

758
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:47,700
How'd you sleep?

759
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:49,433
Like crap.

760
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:51,900
Can you tell the doctor I need
a higher dosage of Trazodone?

761
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:54,200
Mmhmm, I will tell him.

762
00:41:56,501 --> 00:41:58,501
Happy birthday.

763
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:06,600
And it comes with this.

764
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:08,601
Mason made that.

765
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,967
Thanks.

766
00:42:13,968 --> 00:42:15,801
I heard your dad's
picking you up.

767
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,466
Yep.

768
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:22,267
You excited?

769
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,133
Whatever.

770
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:05,233
Dan, you have a visitor at the

771
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:06,233
front gate.

772
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:07,666
Dan to the front gate.

773
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:11,666
The barber of Seville!

774
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:25,633
Bye, Shawnta.

775
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:26,633
Bye.

776
00:43:26,634 --> 00:43:27,633
Bye, Shawnta.

777
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:29,634
Byebye.

778
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:49,433
To encounter
so many sharks can be...

779
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,299
The fact that
this occurs on the eve of

780
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,733
the summer solstice
left me wondering.

781
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,500
Damn it.

782
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:04,066
Will you watch the kids?

783
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:04,800
Sure.

784
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:06,767
Nate.

785
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:16,700
Jayden.

786
00:45:16,701 --> 00:45:20,933
Come on, you know you can't
keep the door closed.

787
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:22,500
Stop pushing on the door.

788
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,700
Hey.

789
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:24,833
Hey, Jade.

790
00:45:24,834 --> 00:45:26,500
I'm really sorry
about your dad.

791
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:27,466
Why can't she close her door?

792
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:28,967
She's a cutter.

793
00:45:28,968 --> 00:45:30,500
I can fucking hear you, dick!

794
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:31,600
Maybe I'll just cut myself right
now, and you'll all lose

795
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:32,533
your fucking jobs!

796
00:45:32,534 --> 00:45:33,900
Come on, Jade.

797
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:34,833
Don't fucking call

798
00:45:34,834 --> 00:45:35,633
me Jade, you bitch!

799
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:41,733
Jayden, come on.

800
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:43,032
Please Just. Open the door.

801
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:44,066
If you just open the
door, then we

802
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:45,566
won't bother you anymore.

803
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,600
If you're not going to open the
door, then we're going to

804
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:49,533
have to force it.

805
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:51,600
Can you help me?

806
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:52,299
Yeah, yeah.

807
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,433
Yeah.

808
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:55,366
OK.

809
00:45:56,501 --> 00:45:57,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

810
00:45:57,901 --> 00:46:00,900
Get the fuck out of my
room, you fucking...

811
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:02,433
stop touching me!

812
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:03,666
All right, easy, easy, easy.

813
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:05,399
One, two, three, down.

814
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,299
Ah, fuck you!

815
00:46:08,634 --> 00:46:10,500
Luis, sit down.

816
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:15,600
You're fucking squishing
me, you fatass!

817
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,500
Sorry, how's that?

818
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:18,600
Let me go!

819
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:20,132
You shouldn't be here, Grace.

820
00:46:20,133 --> 00:46:21,666
What's wrong, Mason?

821
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:23,666
Can't handle me for yourself,
you weak-ass fuck?

822
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:25,666
Need the bitch to
do it for you?

823
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:26,967
Hold her good, Nate.

824
00:46:26,968 --> 00:46:29,566
Yeah, hold me good, Nate.

825
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:32,566
Sorry, man.

826
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,533
You're going to be OK, Jayden.

827
00:46:37,534 --> 00:46:38,933
It's going to be OK.

828
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:40,633
I hate you.

829
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:41,600
I hate you.

830
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:42,566
I hate you.

831
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,433
I hate you.

832
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,566
That's fine.

833
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:47,766
You don't have to like
me right now.

834
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:49,567
Just let it pass.

835
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:53,733
How we doing, Nate?

836
00:46:53,734 --> 00:46:55,666
Not so good.

837
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:57,733
You're doing good.

838
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:59,534
You're doing really good.

839
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,800
Grace.

840
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:10,601
How's my cupcake?

841
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:17,066
The ancient islands are cold.

842
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,500
How is she?

843
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:19,967
I guess she's in the
cool-down room now.

844
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:21,567
I need that.

845
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:25,132
Common gray seals can be

846
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,666
found here in abundance.

847
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:31,666
In fact, Scotland is home to 40%
of the world's gray seal

848
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,501
population.

849
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:36,868
Everybody grab one.

850
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,467
Come on.

851
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:04,601
You want to see mine?

852
00:48:13,968 --> 00:48:15,967
Shit.

853
00:48:15,968 --> 00:48:18,766
That one's from a sneeze.

854
00:48:18,767 --> 00:48:21,633
Slipped and cut too deep.

855
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:23,667
Almost cut my achilles.

856
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:28,633
Why?

857
00:48:28,634 --> 00:48:30,234
Hmm.

858
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,467
My mom died.

859
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:39,067
I went to live with
my dad and...

860
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:45,633
it's impossible to worry about
anything else when there's

861
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:47,234
blood coming out of you.

862
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,167
God, I hate that thing.

863
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,000
Me too.

864
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:45,467
Take as much time as you need.

865
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:10,667
Happy birthday to you!

866
00:50:13,234 --> 00:50:14,233
Blow them out!

867
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:15,233
Blow them out!

868
00:50:15,234 --> 00:50:16,433
Blow them out!

869
00:50:16,434 --> 00:50:17,800
Go!

870
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:19,833
Jayden!

871
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:20,833
Jayden!

872
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:21,800
Jayden!

873
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:22,466
Jayden!

874
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:23,199
Jayden!

875
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,199
Jayden!

876
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,867
Jayden!

877
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:26,166
Jayden!

878
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:27,766
Jayden!

879
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:38,233
Ah, big booty, big
booty, big booty!

880
00:50:38,234 --> 00:50:39,800
Big booty number four.

881
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:41,166
Number four, number five.

882
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,199
Number five, number six.

883
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,500
Number six, number five.

884
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:44,733
Number 5, number 10.

885
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:45,900
Number seven, big booty.

886
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:47,733
Big booty, number 10.

887
00:50:47,734 --> 00:50:49,666
Aw!

888
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:52,766
Come on, she works here.

889
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:54,266
She should be embarrassed.

890
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:56,099
I am embarrassed.

891
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,032
Hey, it's OK.

892
00:50:57,033 --> 00:50:58,299
It happens to all of us.

893
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,833
Let's go for another
round Ready?

894
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:05,733
Ah, big booty, big booty...

895
00:51:36,234 --> 00:51:37,766
Hmm, slow this down
a little bit.

896
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:39,700
Yo, y'all ain't got
no rhythm, man.

897
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:40,766
Tell me about it.

898
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:41,867
I'm trying to keep
them in line.

899
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:43,766
It's just so hard.

900
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,900
Mase, I love you like
a brother but I got to

901
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:49,466
say that when it come to being
discreet, you're a disgrace.

902
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:52,433
I mean, he think we all don't
know about him and Grace on

903
00:51:52,434 --> 00:51:54,999
the low undercover
trying to date.

904
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,199
I don't know what you're
talking about.

905
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,233
Uh, I'm out the gate, right?

906
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:03,666
My name is Nate.

907
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:07,266
When I came here, y'all
tried to player-hate.

908
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:16,867
Everyone sit down, please.

909
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:18,467
We have an AWOL.

910
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:23,933
Jayden!

911
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:24,900
Grace!

912
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:26,466
Stay with the kids!

913
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:28,433
I'll call you when I get her.

914
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,132
This happens.

915
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:37,967
It's fine.

916
00:52:37,968 --> 00:52:40,666
Jayden!

917
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,500
Jayden, can you slow
down, please?

918
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,032
I feel like I'm going to barf.

919
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:45,566
Keep... keep the same distance.

920
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:46,533
Stop!

921
00:52:46,534 --> 00:52:47,099
OK.

922
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,701
OK.

923
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,234
You can't touch me
outside of the grounds.

924
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:59,867
Well, can I walk with you?

925
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:02,334
Walk all you want, but I'm
not going back there.

926
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:06,334
Let's walk, then.

927
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:22,601
Jayden, you know you're not
supposed to be here.

928
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:33,266
Hey.

929
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:34,967
Um, we're at her dad's house.

930
00:54:34,968 --> 00:54:38,967
I don't think that anyone's
here, but she went in anyway.

931
00:54:38,968 --> 00:54:40,567
OK, thanks.

932
00:54:58,968 --> 00:55:00,567
He's not home?

933
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:12,400
Do you want to go back?

934
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:20,901
OK.

935
00:55:41,834 --> 00:55:43,434
You OK?

936
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,701
I'll see you tomorrow.

937
00:55:51,734 --> 00:55:55,833
You want to hear a story
I've been working on?

938
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:57,434
Of course.

939
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:10,433
Well, it's a kid's story, so
there aren't any big words.

940
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,434
OK.

941
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:15,999
Once upon a time, somewhere
miles and miles beneath the

942
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,233
surface of the ocean,
there lived a young

943
00:56:19,234 --> 00:56:22,166
octopus named Nina.

944
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:25,666
Nina spent most of her time
alone making strange creations

945
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:27,533
out of rocks and shells.

946
00:56:27,534 --> 00:56:30,666
And she was very happy.

947
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:34,766
But then on Monday the
shark showed up.

948
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:37,299
"What's your name?"
said the shark.

949
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,066
"Nina," she replied.

950
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:42,233
"Do you want to be my
friend?" he asked.

951
00:56:42,234 --> 00:56:43,466
"OK.

952
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,433
"What do I have to
do?" said Nina.

953
00:56:46,434 --> 00:56:47,999
"Not much," said the shark.

954
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,066
"Just let me eat one
of your arms."

955
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:54,900
Nina had never had a friend
before, so she wondered if

956
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:58,099
this was what you had
to do to get one.

957
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,199
She looked down at her eight
arms and decided it wouldn't

958
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,967
be so bad to give up one.

959
00:57:02,968 --> 00:57:06,467
So she donated an arm to her
wonderful new friend.

960
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,132
Wow.

961
00:57:11,133 --> 00:57:13,833
Every day that week, Nina and
the shark would play together.

962
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:17,633
They explored caves, built
castles of sand, and swam

963
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,933
really, really fast.

964
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:23,099
And every night the shark would
be hungry, and Nina

965
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,634
would give him another one
of her arms to eat.

966
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:34,333
On Sunday, after playing all
day, the shark told Nina that

967
00:57:34,334 --> 00:57:36,500
he was very hungry.

968
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:38,399
"I don't understand," she said.

969
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,266
"I've already given you six of
my arms, and now you want one

970
00:57:41,267 --> 00:57:45,366
"more?" The shark looked at her
with a friendly smile and

971
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:48,032
said, "I don't want one."

972
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:54,900
This time I want them all."
"But why?" Nina asked.

973
00:57:54,901 --> 00:57:57,299
And the shark replied, "because
that's what friends"

974
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:57,912
are for."

975
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:06,833
When the shark finished
his meal, he felt

976
00:58:06,834 --> 00:58:09,299
very sad and lonely.

977
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,032
He missed having someone to
explore caves, build castles,

978
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:15,534
and swim really, really
fast with.

979
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,299
He missed Nina very much.

980
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,600
So he...

981
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:26,200
he swam away to find
another friend.

982
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,234
Jayden?

983
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,234
Did your dad ever hurt you?

984
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,567
Does he still hurt you?

985
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:41,200
We can't let her go back there.

986
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:48,601
That's not going to happen.

987
00:59:53,634 --> 00:59:57,266
You were pretty amazing today.

988
00:59:57,267 --> 00:59:58,800
Thank you.

989
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:38,566
Hmm?

990
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,533
More, please.

991
01:00:43,534 --> 01:00:44,466
More for everyone.

992
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:45,433
More of everything.

993
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:47,233
Anyone, dessert first?

994
01:00:47,234 --> 01:00:47,867
Dessert?

995
01:00:47,868 --> 01:00:50,766
Dessert first?

996
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:52,433
Excuse me, excuse me.

997
01:00:52,434 --> 01:00:53,399
Hello, hello.

998
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,399
Hi.

999
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,233
Um.

1000
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:55,933
Ahem.

1001
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,132
But I'm going to say it in
English so I don't embarrass

1002
01:01:03,133 --> 01:01:05,833
myself any more than I need to.

1003
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:09,466
Uh, I just want to take
a moment to say

1004
01:01:09,467 --> 01:01:12,833
thank you, Mama, Pops.

1005
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:17,666
I don't think anyone here thinks
of you as just our

1006
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:19,900
foster parents.

1007
01:01:19,901 --> 01:01:22,500
I don't even know what that
term means because to me,

1008
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:25,933
you're just Ma and Pa.

1009
01:01:25,934 --> 01:01:30,566
And I think I speak for everyone
here when I say,

1010
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:33,366
thank you for taking us in.

1011
01:01:33,367 --> 01:01:36,733
For taking me in when I was just
a punk kid who was scared

1012
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,734
of everything.

1013
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,533
When I had no one else, you
accepted me and you showed me

1014
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,934
what it was like...

1015
01:01:49,801 --> 01:01:53,999
um, what it was like
to be loved.

1016
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,233
And none of us would be here
if it weren't for you.

1017
01:01:59,234 --> 01:02:03,633
Just look at this beautiful
family you made.

1018
01:02:03,634 --> 01:02:07,900
So let's all lift our glasses
to our king and queen.

1019
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:10,032
Happy 30th, you guys.

1020
01:02:10,033 --> 01:02:13,099
Everything good in my life
is because of you.

1021
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:13,633
Salud.

1022
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:15,500
Salud!

1023
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:27,567
Will you marry me?

1024
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:34,633
You're serious?

1025
01:03:34,634 --> 01:03:35,600
Yeah.

1026
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:37,200
I'm dead serious.

1027
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:13,267
Mmm.

1028
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:19,600
Who the hell is calling
on the land line?

1029
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:28,133
Hello?

1030
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,533
Yeah.

1031
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:35,466
This is, uh, actually
her, uh, fiance.

1032
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:38,633
And if this is about her dad,
it'd probably be best if you

1033
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:40,434
just let me relay the message.

1034
01:04:43,434 --> 01:04:45,033
Mm-hmm.

1035
01:04:49,367 --> 01:04:50,968
Oh, shit.

1036
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:59,967
Who was it?

1037
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:01,800
Um.

1038
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:06,333
That was someone from the
probation department.

1039
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:09,633
They said that your dad's
probably going to get released

1040
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:11,234
next month.

1041
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:08,633
Hey.

1042
01:06:08,634 --> 01:06:09,800
I really think we need to talk
through some of this stuff.

1043
01:06:09,801 --> 01:06:11,867
Not right now, Mason.

1044
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:12,600
I'll be fine.

1045
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:13,700
I just...

1046
01:06:13,701 --> 01:06:15,501
I just need to work.

1047
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:21,633
Hey.

1048
01:06:21,634 --> 01:06:22,833
Hi.

1049
01:06:22,834 --> 01:06:25,566
Marcus' fish died last night.

1050
01:06:25,567 --> 01:06:27,533
What?

1051
01:06:27,534 --> 01:06:31,800
He thinks Luis had something
to do with it.

1052
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:33,400
Did he?

1053
01:06:40,601 --> 01:06:43,800
Tell me you didn't do something
to Marcus' fish.

1054
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:44,666
What?

1055
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,066
Luis, tell me.

1056
01:06:46,067 --> 01:06:47,668
I don't know what you're
talking about.

1057
01:06:49,934 --> 01:06:51,534
I swear!

1058
01:07:01,868 --> 01:07:03,467
I'm really sorry, Marcus.

1059
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:10,533
It wasn't Luis.

1060
01:07:10,534 --> 01:07:12,133
It don't matter.

1061
01:07:16,234 --> 01:07:20,132
I'd like to be left alone,
if that's cool with you.

1062
01:07:20,133 --> 01:07:21,734
OK.

1063
01:07:23,701 --> 01:07:25,701
Just let me know if
you need anything.

1064
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:45,533
Have you guys seen Jayden?

1065
01:07:45,534 --> 01:07:47,133
Uhuh.

1066
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:52,199
Jess?

1067
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,900
Where's Jayden?

1068
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:55,566
Oh, her dad showed up last
night and took her on pass for

1069
01:07:55,567 --> 01:07:56,967
the weekend.

1070
01:07:56,968 --> 01:07:57,900
What?

1071
01:07:57,901 --> 01:07:59,500
Jack signed off on it.

1072
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:01,501
Are you fucking kidding me?

1073
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,766
How could you let her go?

1074
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:12,833
Uh, Jan, let me call
you right back, OK?

1075
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:13,999
The man called.

1076
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,066
He apologized.

1077
01:08:15,067 --> 01:08:16,733
He had a personal emergency.

1078
01:08:16,734 --> 01:08:18,867
That's not even the
point, Jack.

1079
01:08:18,868 --> 01:08:20,600
Did you read my report?

1080
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,433
Of course I
did, and I was very concerned.

1081
01:08:22,434 --> 01:08:25,233
But when Jayden's social worker
asked her about it, she

1082
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,999
said her father had never
been abusive in any way.

1083
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,199
Of course she said that.

1084
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,766
She's fucking scared!

1085
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:33,633
What the fuck did they teach
you guys in grad school?

1086
01:08:33,634 --> 01:08:36,099
Jack, in her mind he is
always right behind

1087
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,466
her, watching her.

1088
01:08:37,467 --> 01:08:38,500
When she is sleeping.

1089
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:40,132
When she is taking a shit.

1090
01:08:40,133 --> 01:08:42,633
When she is alone with her
therapist, he is right there

1091
01:08:42,634 --> 01:08:44,433
watching her, ready to pounce.

1092
01:08:44,434 --> 01:08:46,900
And you just expect her to
just come out and say it?

1093
01:08:46,901 --> 01:08:48,533
Are you guys fucking stupid?

1094
01:08:48,534 --> 01:08:50,533
Because she was here asking for
help, and you just send

1095
01:08:50,534 --> 01:08:52,666
her back to the fucking shark.

1096
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:54,666
I realize you're upset, Grace.

1097
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:57,066
But yelling at me isn't
an effective form of

1098
01:08:57,067 --> 01:08:58,667
communication.

1099
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:01,600
OK.

1100
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:03,200
OK, Jack.

1101
01:09:04,934 --> 01:09:06,566
Jack, I'm sorry.

1102
01:09:06,567 --> 01:09:09,766
Please cancel the pass until we
figure this out, because I

1103
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:13,266
know her and I know that things
are not good at home.

1104
01:09:13,267 --> 01:09:14,666
And how do you know that?

1105
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:16,299
Because she read you
a children's story?

1106
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,833
Don't fuck with me, Jack.

1107
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:19,967
I am on the floor every
day with those kids.

1108
01:09:19,968 --> 01:09:22,999
And last night, that girl sat
next to me and she cried, and

1109
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,933
she tried to tell me the only
way that she knew how.

1110
01:09:25,934 --> 01:09:29,099
Grace, you are a line staff.

1111
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,600
It's not your job to
interpret tears.

1112
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:33,266
That's what our trained
therapists are here for.

1113
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:36,032
Then your trained therapists
don't know shit.

1114
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:38,999
Did she tell you that she was
being abused by her father?

1115
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,533
She didn't have to.

1116
01:09:40,534 --> 01:09:42,900
If I'm going to take that child
away from her biological

1117
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:46,999
parent, yes, she does.

1118
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,600
This is bullshit.

1119
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:51,867
Grace, I have been working with
these kids longer than

1120
01:09:51,868 --> 01:09:53,399
you've been alive.

1121
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,533
And there's not one of them
that I wouldn't die for.

1122
01:09:56,534 --> 01:09:58,233
I look into those broken eyes.

1123
01:09:58,234 --> 01:10:00,666
I want to go out and find the
asshole who did that to them

1124
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:02,500
and beat the shit out of them.

1125
01:10:02,501 --> 01:10:06,266
But although I feel that way
every single day, I know I

1126
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:08,533
can't track down everyone
who's hurt them.

1127
01:10:08,534 --> 01:10:11,500
I know I can't heal all their
wounds, and I can't start

1128
01:10:11,501 --> 01:10:16,399
accusing all their parents of
being sexual offenders.

1129
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,433
Especially when they're
friends of

1130
01:10:17,434 --> 01:10:21,132
friends, right, Jack?

1131
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:22,934
We're finished here, Grace.

1132
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,701
Jan...

1133
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,801
Sam.

1134
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:28,367
Marcus?

1135
01:12:30,133 --> 01:12:31,734
Marcus?

1136
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,466
Marcus?

1137
01:12:37,467 --> 01:12:38,747
What are you doing
in Luis' room?

1138
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,701
Oh, no.

1139
01:12:48,267 --> 01:12:49,166
Luis?

1140
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:50,166
Luis?

1141
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:52,299
Luis!

1142
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,901
What?

1143
01:12:56,767 --> 01:12:57,267
No.

1144
01:12:57,268 --> 01:12:57,967
Shit.

1145
01:12:57,968 --> 01:12:58,500
Shit!

1146
01:12:58,501 --> 01:12:59,466
Mason!

1147
01:12:59,467 --> 01:13:01,166
Somebody, anybody come!

1148
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:02,333
Help me!

1149
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:03,700
Luis!

1150
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:04,533
Luis, I need your pillowcase
right now.

1151
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:06,233
Give it to me.

1152
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:08,800
Quicker, please.

1153
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:09,800
Marcus?

1154
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:10,633
Marcus.

1155
01:13:10,634 --> 01:13:11,566
Marcus, please look at me.

1156
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:12,533
Marcus, look at me.

1157
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:13,633
You're going to be OK.

1158
01:13:13,634 --> 01:13:16,266
I just need you to look at me.

1159
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:19,633
Marcus, look at me.

1160
01:13:19,634 --> 01:13:21,634
What the fuck is
taking so long?

1161
01:13:29,634 --> 01:13:32,400
Now I have a real friend.

1162
01:13:35,567 --> 01:13:39,566
I'm going to call
you, uh, Dudley.

1163
01:14:00,033 --> 01:14:01,900
Dr. Stone...

1164
01:14:01,901 --> 01:14:03,533
Blake Johnson, dial 93, please.

1165
01:14:03,534 --> 01:14:05,534
Blake Johnson, dial 93.

1166
01:14:09,501 --> 01:14:11,501
They still don't know anything.

1167
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:24,466
I can't do this.

1168
01:14:24,467 --> 01:14:26,467
Grace.

1169
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:31,199
Hey.

1170
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,099
Grace, where are you going?

1171
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,667
I can't do this.

1172
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:36,533
OK, let's go.

1173
01:14:36,534 --> 01:14:37,466
Let's go.

1174
01:14:37,467 --> 01:14:38,666
I'll drive us home.

1175
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:40,433
Don't want to go home.

1176
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:44,032
That's not what I'm
talking about.

1177
01:14:44,033 --> 01:14:46,166
I know it's been a really
fucked up day, OK?

1178
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:50,600
Mason, you have no idea what
I'm going through right now.

1179
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:53,333
Then tell me.

1180
01:14:53,334 --> 01:14:54,867
That's how this works.

1181
01:14:54,868 --> 01:14:56,999
You talk to me about it so that
I can take your hand and

1182
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,099
fucking walk through
this shit with you.

1183
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,132
That is what I signed
up for, OK?

1184
01:15:01,133 --> 01:15:04,868
But I cannot do that if
you won't let me in.

1185
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,200
I can't.

1186
01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:15,133
I'm sorry.

1187
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,333
You're sorry?

1188
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:24,199
Grace, are you serious?

1189
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,099
I've been waiting for you for
a really long time, and I

1190
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,566
wouldn't take a second of it
back because I love you so

1191
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,900
goddamn much, OK?

1192
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:34,666
But I have been waiting for
three years for you to tell me

1193
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:37,266
why you still don't trust me.

1194
01:15:37,267 --> 01:15:39,967
I've been waiting for three
years for you to just once

1195
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,066
take the advice that you give
your kids every fuckin' five

1196
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:44,633
minutes and learn to talk
about what's going

1197
01:15:44,634 --> 01:15:46,933
on inside your head.

1198
01:15:46,934 --> 01:15:48,734
You can't do that for me?

1199
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:55,701
Whatever it is, OK,
just talk to me.

1200
01:15:59,834 --> 01:16:01,767
But I can't do this.

1201
01:16:07,467 --> 01:16:08,633
I can't...

1202
01:16:08,634 --> 01:16:11,399
I can't marry you.

1203
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,700
I can't have your baby.

1204
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,701
I can't have any of it.

1205
01:16:21,634 --> 01:16:23,634
I can't do it.

1206
01:16:33,801 --> 01:16:35,601
So what do you want to do?

1207
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:42,199
Hmm?

1208
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:49,733
Do you want to get an abortion?

1209
01:16:49,734 --> 01:16:51,734
I already made the appointment.

1210
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:14,333
Do whatever you want, OK?

1211
01:17:14,334 --> 01:17:15,734
Because I'm done.

1212
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:15,500
Kids don't
care nothing about it.

1213
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,933
Ed, do you
want some vittles today?

1214
01:19:22,934 --> 01:19:24,533
I do, Granny.

1215
01:19:24,534 --> 01:19:26,466
I worked up a right smart
appetite fetching

1216
01:19:26,467 --> 01:19:27,999
sticks for old Duke.

1217
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,800
Yes, that's
the trouble around here.

1218
01:19:29,801 --> 01:19:31,700
The critters are taking over.

1219
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:35,266
Billie Mae has done made pets
out of everything but my

1220
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:36,333
pickled turnips.

1221
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:37,967
What are we going to
do for vittles?

1222
01:19:37,968 --> 01:19:38,999
Wait, I remember

1223
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,533
someplace to drive near...

1224
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:54,133
What are you doing?

1225
01:19:56,234 --> 01:19:58,467
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

1226
01:20:21,868 --> 01:20:23,901
Are you going crazy?

1227
01:20:27,767 --> 01:20:29,567
Probably.

1228
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:43,933
When I was your age, I had to
stand in a courtroom with a

1229
01:20:43,934 --> 01:20:47,700
bunch of strangers and tell
them all the ways

1230
01:20:47,701 --> 01:20:49,300
that he abused me.

1231
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:54,467
What he hit me with.

1232
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,000
How he got drunk.

1233
01:21:00,267 --> 01:21:02,901
How he forced me to take
a shower with him.

1234
01:21:08,534 --> 01:21:10,133
Got me pregnant.

1235
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:17,267
I sent him to prison.

1236
01:21:20,601 --> 01:21:24,566
I didn't talk about it.

1237
01:21:24,567 --> 01:21:26,367
I didn't think about it.

1238
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:32,067
Until I met you.

1239
01:21:37,534 --> 01:21:38,934
And I don't know.

1240
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:45,766
I have a baby inside of
me, and I don't know.

1241
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:47,634
I don't know what I'm doing.

1242
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,300
I was just trying to help you.

1243
01:22:12,701 --> 01:22:15,666
Oh my god.

1244
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:18,700
He loves the belt.

1245
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:20,600
It's such a cliche.

1246
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:23,500
Jayden, we have to do
something about this.

1247
01:22:23,501 --> 01:22:25,800
Should go bash his face
in with a baseball

1248
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:27,400
bat while he's sleeping?

1249
01:23:05,567 --> 01:23:09,967
Uh, we should get out of here.

1250
01:23:09,968 --> 01:23:11,767
He'll sleep through anything.

1251
01:24:16,501 --> 01:24:17,900
OK.

1252
01:24:17,901 --> 01:24:19,501
Now we should get out of here.

1253
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,867
They're going to ask you
a lot of questions.

1254
01:24:51,868 --> 01:24:55,032
It's going to be hard.

1255
01:24:55,033 --> 01:24:56,666
I'll try to leave out the part
about you breaking into

1256
01:24:56,667 --> 01:24:58,734
that house with a baseball bat.

1257
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:03,267
Thanks.

1258
01:25:04,634 --> 01:25:06,834
You're going to be
a really good mom.

1259
01:25:14,033 --> 01:25:17,501
I told him this was going to be
the last time I came home.

1260
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:22,667
Because I'm not going to
take his shit anymore.

1261
01:25:25,534 --> 01:25:28,133
And that set him
off, of course.

1262
01:25:30,934 --> 01:25:32,534
But I didn't care.

1263
01:26:00,767 --> 01:26:02,300
I'm sorry.

1264
01:26:03,834 --> 01:26:06,300
I didn't mean what
I said earlier.

1265
01:26:08,434 --> 01:26:10,734
I'm just really messed
up right now.

1266
01:26:36,033 --> 01:26:37,734
Marcus is going to get better.

1267
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:43,467
I think I am too.

1268
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:04,766
Grace, I know talking like
this is really hard.

1269
01:27:04,767 --> 01:27:09,199
But this is our fourth session
together, and I'd really like

1270
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,801
you to try, OK?

1271
01:27:16,901 --> 01:27:19,267
I don't really know
what to say.

1272
01:27:21,767 --> 01:27:23,800
Your dad's getting out
of prison in a week.

1273
01:27:23,801 --> 01:27:26,300
Do you want to talk about that?

1274
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:37,434
OK.

1275
01:27:59,167 --> 01:28:02,233
Are you OK?

1276
01:28:02,234 --> 01:28:03,834
Mmhmm.

1277
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,400
Watch that monitor
over my shoulder.

1278
01:28:12,434 --> 01:28:14,533
I think he's... there we go.

1279
01:28:14,534 --> 01:28:16,334
There he is.

1280
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,199
Stay with it.

1281
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,667
Hang on a second.

1282
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,900
Hang on.

1283
01:28:27,901 --> 01:28:30,833
That's... that's the baby's
heartbeat, man.

1284
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:32,434
Oh, man.

1285
01:29:14,901 --> 01:29:18,933
So you need to get ready for
this because it's so fucking

1286
01:29:18,934 --> 01:29:20,266
unbelievable.

1287
01:29:20,267 --> 01:29:21,999
It's going to seem fake, but
I promise you it's not.

1288
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,366
Grace will vouch for it.

1289
01:29:23,367 --> 01:29:24,833
It depends if you
tell it right.

1290
01:29:24,834 --> 01:29:26,500
There is no way not
to tell this right.

1291
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:28,366
It is a storyteller's
wet dream.

1292
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:29,299
What?

1293
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,633
Get ready for this.

1294
01:29:30,634 --> 01:29:32,032
OK, just in time.

1295
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:32,900
I'm going to start at
the beginning, OK.

1296
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:34,199
OK.

1297
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,366
So three years ago, right,
we have this girl

1298
01:29:35,367 --> 01:29:37,099
here named Liza Green.

1299
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:40,032
She's 17, older than everybody
else on the unit at the time.

1300
01:29:40,033 --> 01:29:42,700
And I don't mean this in a pervy
way or anything, but

1301
01:29:42,701 --> 01:29:43,999
she's real pretty.

1302
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,533
She was gorgeous.

1303
01:29:45,534 --> 01:29:47,700
All the guys on the unit want
her, but she won't give any of

1304
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:49,299
them the time of day because
she was busy.

1305
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,233
She was always studying.

1306
01:29:50,234 --> 01:29:51,132
She was very smart.

1307
01:29:51,133 --> 01:29:51,967
Mmhmm.

1308
01:29:51,968 --> 01:29:53,299
Really smart.

1309
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,666
So two weeks before she turns
18 and leaves, we

1310
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:56,600
get this new intake.

1311
01:29:56,601 --> 01:29:58,500
It's a 15-year-old guy.

1312
01:29:58,501 --> 01:29:59,399
He's really tough.

1313
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,299
He's really quiet.

1314
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,032
But he's cool.

1315
01:30:02,033 --> 01:30:03,967
He's just kind of like kicking
back, checking out the scene.

1316
01:30:03,968 --> 01:30:07,266
And I swear I didn't hear him
say a word the whole first

1317
01:30:07,267 --> 01:30:08,999
week he was here.

1318
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,266
But then one day we were doing
community meeting, and we ask

1319
01:30:11,267 --> 01:30:12,433
for announcements.

1320
01:30:12,434 --> 01:30:14,266
And this guy raises his hand.

1321
01:30:14,267 --> 01:30:18,666
And he looks directly at Liza
Green and he says, I know you

1322
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:19,900
don't know me.

1323
01:30:19,901 --> 01:30:21,233
I just got here.

1324
01:30:21,234 --> 01:30:23,066
But I just want to say that
I've been watching you.

1325
01:30:23,067 --> 01:30:25,199
I think you're the most
interesting thing about this

1326
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,299
place, and I'm really sad I'm
not going to get to know you

1327
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:29,466
before you leave.

1328
01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:30,600
I just wanted to tell you that.

1329
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:32,466
What a pimp!

1330
01:30:32,467 --> 01:30:33,566
What did she say?

1331
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:34,833
Nothing.

1332
01:30:34,834 --> 01:30:35,766
Nothing?

1333
01:30:35,767 --> 01:30:37,266
It was so awkward.

1334
01:30:37,267 --> 01:30:38,999
Yeah, so fuckin' awkward
I couldn't stand it.

1335
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,066
And then she left, and
never talked to him.

1336
01:30:41,067 --> 01:30:43,233
The kids teased him
for like a year.

1337
01:30:43,234 --> 01:30:44,199
Aw.

1338
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,266
Oh, that blows.

1339
01:30:45,267 --> 01:30:46,666
No, he didn't give a shit.

1340
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,266
No, didn't even faze him.

1341
01:30:48,267 --> 01:30:51,399
It was like he knew something
everybody else didn't.

1342
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,700
Who is this guy?

1343
01:30:52,701 --> 01:30:53,566
That was Marcus.

1344
01:30:53,567 --> 01:30:54,600
What?

1345
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:55,533
I never heard this story.

1346
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:56,500
Oh, wait.

1347
01:30:56,501 --> 01:30:57,433
It gets so much better.

1348
01:30:57,434 --> 01:30:58,366
Yeah.

1349
01:30:58,367 --> 01:31:00,099
Yeah, so check this out.

1350
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,099
Grace and I are getting coffee
at Ronnie's this morning, and

1351
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,399
we walk in.

1352
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,266
And who do we see sitting
there alone at a table?

1353
01:31:04,267 --> 01:31:05,700
Marcus.

1354
01:31:05,701 --> 01:31:06,533
How's he doing?

1355
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:07,766
Oh!

1356
01:31:07,767 --> 01:31:08,600
He looks great.

1357
01:31:08,601 --> 01:31:09,500
He's so good.

1358
01:31:09,501 --> 01:31:10,600
Buttoned-up shirt.

1359
01:31:10,601 --> 01:31:12,500
He's sippin' on a cappuccino.

1360
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:14,099
Marcus drinks cappuccino?

1361
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:14,999
Yeah.

1362
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,099
Apparently.

1363
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:17,333
Yeah, I guess so.

1364
01:31:17,334 --> 01:31:19,066
Apparently now he does.

1365
01:31:19,067 --> 01:31:20,066
So we're
talking to him and we're

1366
01:31:20,067 --> 01:31:21,566
catching up.

1367
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:23,032
And he's telling us about his
new job at the aquarium and

1368
01:31:23,033 --> 01:31:24,633
how much he takes home in tips.

1369
01:31:24,634 --> 01:31:25,600
And now he's going to
start applying for

1370
01:31:25,601 --> 01:31:26,833
classes next semester.

1371
01:31:26,834 --> 01:31:27,533
Oh my god!

1372
01:31:27,534 --> 01:31:29,099
Yeah.

1373
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,132
And it's weird because I'm like,
I have not heard Marcus

1374
01:31:31,133 --> 01:31:33,366
talk this much ever,
since I met him.

1375
01:31:33,367 --> 01:31:35,299
Like, what is the deal?

1376
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,500
Is he excited to see us?

1377
01:31:36,501 --> 01:31:38,099
Is he nervous about something?

1378
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:41,700
And that's when I notice there's
another cappuccino on

1379
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:44,299
the table and an empty
chair next to him.

1380
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:48,766
And then just like in the
fucking movies, bathroom door

1381
01:31:48,767 --> 01:31:52,800
flings open, out walks
Liza Green.

1382
01:31:52,801 --> 01:31:53,900
They were on a date?

1383
01:31:53,901 --> 01:31:55,266
It was like their fifth one.

1384
01:31:55,267 --> 01:31:56,299
Yes!

1385
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,032
Oh!

1386
01:31:58,033 --> 01:32:00,633
As soon... as soon as she sits
down, dude just goes beet-red.

1387
01:32:00,634 --> 01:32:01,566
He's so embarrassed.

1388
01:32:01,567 --> 01:32:03,233
Oh, it was so cute.

1389
01:32:03,234 --> 01:32:05,666
Oh, it was so fucking cute,
I almost pissed my pants.

1390
01:32:05,667 --> 01:32:07,733
Oh Jess, they look
so happy together.

1391
01:32:07,734 --> 01:32:08,666
So happy.

1392
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:09,633
And there's just...

1393
01:32:11,634 --> 01:32:13,633
Here we go.
