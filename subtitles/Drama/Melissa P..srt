1
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,287
"Dear Diary,
today is the last day of school.

2
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,282
The summer is starting.

3
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,249
But the most important news
is that Manuela and I...

4
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,243
...have been invited to the swimming
pool at Daniele's house!"

5
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,402
"I've waited for
this moment for months.

6
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,448
Maybe this time
he'll pay some attention to me..."

7
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,205
Elvira!

8
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,719
Elvira!

9
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,367
Could you wake your granddaughter up?
I'm running late.

10
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,806
Melissa, hurry up,
you're going to be late for school.

11
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,445
Elvira?

12
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,160
What are you doing?
Can't you hear me?

13
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,559
Please, can you do it?

14
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,404
I'm late,
I still have to finish getting ready.

15
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,285
Sorry.

16
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,009
All right, I'll do it myself.

17
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,089
What a mess!

18
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,926
- Sweetheart, the alarm!
- Go away!

19
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,162
Sorry, darling, but you're
going to be late for school.

20
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,559
Get out!

21
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,165
We arrived at 4 pm.

22
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,525
SUMMER

23
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,238
On the whole way there
I just wanted to turn back.

24
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,889
My heart was in my mouth.

25
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,688
- Wait, don't ring!
- Why not?

26
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,840
It's still early.

27
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,763
No, it's not, this is the time
Titti told us to come.

28
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,329
Feel this.

29
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,240
- I don't feel anything.
- But how!

30
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,641
It feels like it's about to explode!
Let's get out of here.

31
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,326
Come on! You've had a crush on him
for a year and now finally...

32
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,401
I look terrible today.

33
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,686
No way! You look gorgeous.

34
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,403
What if he finds out I can't swim?

35
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,800
- Stay away from the pool.
- And if he kisses me...

36
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,962
...and realizes it's my first time?
- Are you crazy?

37
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,326
With all the rehearsing we've done!

38
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,206
- Who's that?
- Which?

39
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,806
- The only fuckable one.
- You're here!

40
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,438
Don't let her run away!
Pin her down, Patrizio!

41
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,682
No! Please let me go!
Put me down, don't be a bastard!

42
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,727
- Hello, Manuela.
- I'm Manuela.

43
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,889
I'm Melissa.

44
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,406
- Well then hello, Melissa.
- Daniele! Come here!

45
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,163
Excuse me.

46
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,403
Well, I...

47
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,441
Fucking assholes, my shoes!

48
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,488
These shoes cost me
two hundred euros.

49
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,689
- Who is that girl lying down?
- Lavinia, Arnaldo's girlfriend. A bitch.

50
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,958
Don't even try throwing me
in the water or I'll kick your ass.

51
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,718
Honey.

52
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,769
I'm going over there.

53
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,249
Be careful,
they'll throw you in the water.

54
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,641
No! She can't swim!

55
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,484
Help her!
Do something!

56
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,085
Were you scared?

57
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,729
Me? No.

58
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,566
I thought you knew how to swim.

59
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,485
Yes, I can swim, but...
I got scared all of a sudden.

60
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,766
But you just told me
you weren't scared.

61
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,204
After!

62
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,889
You got scared.

63
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,887
Come on! I'll show you
the nicest part of the garden.

64
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,202
So you don't know how to swim.
I can teach you one day.

65
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,328
You can come back,
without all these people.

66
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,925
- Well?
- Well what?

67
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,444
Will you come?

68
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,681
- Yes.
- You like it here?

69
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,045
Yes.

70
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,169
And you like me?

71
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,321
- Enough.
- What does your father do?

72
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,083
Engineer.

73
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,120
- He builds streets?
- No. Oil.

74
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,884
He's on a platform
in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

75
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,927
He'll be back within a year.

76
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,279
And your mother?

77
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,929
She sells bridal gowns.

78
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,162
- Do you have any brothers?
- No. Just a friend.

79
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,605
- You confide in her.
- Yes.

80
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,159
- Do you tell her everything?
- Yes.

81
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,885
And what will you tell her about me?

82
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,804
I don't know.

83
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,078
You look like a kid.

84
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,399
How old are you?

85
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,561
Fifteen and a half.

86
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,006
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

87
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,169
Do you?

88
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,640
- What?
- A girlfriend!

89
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,678
No, I don't.

90
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,960
Are you a virgin?

91
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,598
Yes.

92
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,246
- How many times have you been kissed?
- Twice.

93
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,321
Which one did you like the best?

94
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,843
The first.

95
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,244
Get up.

96
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,848
What do you want from me?

97
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,282
You want to kiss me?

98
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,208
You want to kiss me?

99
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,204
You want to kiss me?

100
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,609
You want to kiss me?

101
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,559
Yes.

102
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,165
Then kiss my dick.

103
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,722
Put it in your mouth.

104
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,528
What are you doing?

105
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,327
Maybe next time
you'll kiss me on the mouth.

106
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,845
I haven't seen him since that day.

107
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,801
I've spent a gloomy summer
full of choking tears...

108
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,087
...waiting for a phone call
that never came.

109
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,687
I wanted to vanish,
to fly away very, very far...

110
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,279
...lik e my father,
to the other side of the world.

111
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,448
AUTUMN

112
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,326
Don't make that face.
Relax!

113
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,279
I'd like to see you in my place!
After what happened he disappeared!

114
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,600
Forget about him,
he doesn't care about you.

115
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,729
I never said he cared about me,
but I care about him.

116
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,281
And it gets worse every day.

117
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,963
Let's go.

118
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,369
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

119
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,802
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

120
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,520
Come in, young ladies.

121
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,330
We were very glad
to wait for you, right?

122
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,249
Roll!

123
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,083
- Abemo, Elisabetta.
- Here.

124
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,207
- Bozzini, Manuela.
- Here.

125
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,008
Caldiron, Clelia e Leo.

126
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,285
- Here.
- Here.

127
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,963
De Angelis, Marco.

128
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,245
First day of school.

129
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,244
I'm so nerv ous.

130
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,526
A new student. Good start!

131
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,007
I must see him. But he isn't here.

132
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,162
Holidays are over for everybody,
except for him.

133
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,843
I am Marco De Angelis.

134
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,560
You know I should kick you out?

135
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,640
No, too easy. Come on in.
Find a place.

136
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,364
I try to hate him
for what he did to me...

137
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,919
...but I can't. I still love him.

138
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,240
At the favourite seat.
They call it the Seat of Death.

139
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,079
He's so cool!

140
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,809
What a loser!

141
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,883
Ah, you're a tough one!
Let's inaugurate the register.

142
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,882
With a nice three.

143
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,128
He doesn't know
how much I lik e him.

144
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,567
Even though he humiliated me,
I forgive him.

145
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,644
If I could hold him tight,
just once, I'd mak e him understand.

146
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,161
Call me, my love.

147
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,878
Call me, call me...

148
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,529
...call me...

149
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,564
- One...
- I'll go!

150
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,323
...two...

151
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,039
...three...

152
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,848
Yes, it's morning here!

153
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,249
I'll pass you to her right away.
And how are you?

154
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,367
Melissa, run, it's Dad!

155
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,361
Melissa!
Open up! It's Dad!

156
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,760
Why do you two always
lock yourselves in there?

157
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,320
Do you want to talk first
to your mother or your daughter?

158
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,165
Daddy, you know
I dreamt about you?

159
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,925
Yes, we were in Paris,
but it was our house.

160
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,684
It'd be more practical
if you used your own bathroom.

161
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,889
- I'm being good. But you be good too!
- At least don't lock yourselves inside.

162
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,564
No, I'm begging you!
Please, don't smoke.

163
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,769
- It bothers me in the bathroom.
- I'm still waiting for your e-mails.

164
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,841
I'll quit right away!

165
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,004
I'm smoking the last one!

166
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,968
I'll pass you to her.

167
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,404
Hi, darling!

168
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,006
Of course I'm taking my medicine.

169
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,445
Why do you always say
the same thing?

170
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,250
And then they say
that old folks lose their minds!

171
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,129
"Dear Diary,
my family is a disaster.

172
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,884
Father is so far away,
Mother doesn't understand a thing.

173
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,690
Thank God I've got Grandma
and Manuela, my best friend."

174
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,840
Slow down!

175
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,002
You shouldn't be afraid
with me! Ever!

176
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,968
Okay, but be careful!

177
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,168
- You trust me?
- Yes, you're the best!

178
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,209
I hate gym...

179
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,680
...but I'm sure
Manu hates it more than I do.

180
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,727
At least we don't have to study.

181
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,167
This year I want something different.

182
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,082
Every day at school
I hope to see him.

183
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,685
It's happened twice already,
in the hallway.

184
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,728
He didn't see me,
or he pretended not to.

185
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,360
How strange, I feel my body
much more than before.

186
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,129
I lik e it...

187
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,959
...but with him I'd lik e it even more.

188
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,248
Did you get excited?

189
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,562
Wow, you're well-equipped!
Who would have thought?

190
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,281
Relax, it's just envy.

191
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,003
I want him. I'm so sure.

192
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,719
Yes, I went to see
the one you suggested.

193
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,642
It looked like a prison!

194
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,922
No, I found another one.

195
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,365
A luxury one. Wait a moment.

196
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,243
Here it is!

197
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,001
"Elegant ambience...

198
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,043
...highly qualified medical personnel."

199
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,602
Eighteen hundred euros.

200
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,524
No, I still haven't spoken
to her about it.

201
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,364
You know it's not easy with her.

202
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,328
Why don't you speak to her?

203
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,720
Okay, okay. I'll try.

204
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,289
Melissa?

205
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,368
Yes, she'll be upset
at the beginning, but later...

206
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,840
You know how children are.

207
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,285
Don't worry,
I was firm about the moped...

208
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,486
...but she always drives Manuela's.

209
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,446
She signed up for swimming lessons.

210
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,648
This time she's really going to learn.

211
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,004
Hello? Can you hear me?

212
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,724
Hello?

213
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,484
Elvira!

214
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,364
I lent it to Melissa
but now I need it.

215
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,080
I'm having tea with some friends.

216
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,405
How can you live with such a mess?

217
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,041
At least in my own room
I can do as I please, no?

218
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,440
Here, this was in the living room.

219
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,646
Forgive me.
It won't happen again. I promise.

220
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,439
How can you go out at this hour?
Do you want me to come pick you up?

221
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,200
Don't worry, I'll take the bus.

222
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,281
No, no, take a cab.

223
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,409
Cabs are expensive.

224
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,926
It's okay. I'll pay for it,
don't make me worry.

225
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,009
I have to talk to you...

226
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,605
...but not now,
you've got things to do.

227
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,569
Tell me, my friends will wait.

228
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,684
- Did you take your pill?
- Yes.

229
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,963
No, I didn't take it.

230
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,568
But that's my business.

231
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,960
No, really it's our business also.

232
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,440
They are good for your heart.

233
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,161
My mum hates Grandma.
Sometimes I think...

234
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,605
...it's because she's jealous
of our relationship.

235
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,240
Thank God she can't interfere
between Manu and me. I adore her.

236
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,441
According to her, I need to be brave...

237
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,487
...and talk to Daniele, face to face.

238
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,721
They said Daniele's already here!

239
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,408
Look at me.

240
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,642
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

241
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,808
But you're Melissa!

242
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,600
You've grown,
I almost didn't recognize you.

243
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,044
How old are you?

244
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,241
I'm almost 16.

245
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,569
Come.

246
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,205
Arnaldo, you remember Melissa?

247
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,718
Melissa...

248
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,370
You're also cute when dry.
Congratulations.

249
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,999
Let's toast to our reunion!

250
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,127
- Lavinia, babe? Everything okay?
- I want to leave. This is annoying.

251
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,849
Did you think about me?

252
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,808
I want to ask you something.
But not here.

253
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,443
Wanna come with me?

254
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,128
Let's go.

255
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,604
You're even prettier
than last summer.

256
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,081
Can I ask you a question?

257
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,007
Do you want to kiss me?

258
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,200
Are you still a virgin?

259
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,923
Yes.

260
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,846
Do you want to do it with me?

261
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,361
I want you so much.

262
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,122
Put this on.

263
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,809
I love you.

264
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,403
I love you.

265
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,208
I love you.

266
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,282
I don't love you.

267
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,002
You're an idiot.

268
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,082
Who asked you?

269
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,889
Dad, dear Dad...

270
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,608
...you can't imagine how much
I'd lik e you to be here.

271
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,081
I would tell you to go to Daniele's
house, to spit on his face...

272
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,798
...to mak e him kneel, to beat him...

273
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,723
...humiliate him as he did with me.

274
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,286
But why is it that only men
can behave lik e that?

275
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,807
From this moment on I swear
that I too will do as they do.

276
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,927
I will think only of my pleasure.

277
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,161
I will treat them all the same.

278
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,128
Not caring for their feelings...

279
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,600
...not caring who I have
in front of me.

280
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,521
Your daughter, Melissa.

281
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,487
But no!
What are you talking about?

282
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,369
No, I know you, Daria.

283
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,441
You've already decided everything.

284
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,368
Actually, you know what I think?

285
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,329
I'll probably feel
more at home over there than here.

286
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,687
Your attention gets on my nerves.
I know it's sincere...

287
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,125
...but it's irritating all the same.

288
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,766
I'm worried about Melissa.

289
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,161
She counts on me.

290
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,848
And on me!

291
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,202
Are you sure?

292
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,081
Why do you treat me like this?

293
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,726
Are you sure I can smoke here?

294
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,007
- Lf not, I'm not going.
- In theory you can't...

295
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,445
...but everybody does,
so they turn a blind eye.

296
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,682
Unfortunately. You should quit.
You know how bad it is for you.

297
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,649
And you don't know
how good it is for me!

298
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,688
"Dear Diary,
Mom has sent Grandma to a home."

299
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,603
- Damn, it's pouring!
- Give me the umbrella.

300
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,447
"She took the horrible decision
without consulting me.

301
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,641
I don't mean anything to her.

302
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,279
But when Dad comes home
for Christmas...

303
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,761
...we'll tak e her back home
and she will stay with us forever."

304
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,605
Do you want to give me
the umbrella?

305
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,687
Elvira, what are you doing?
You'll get soaked!

306
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,441
Sweetheart, why are you doing this?

307
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,726
You know Grandma
has a heart condition.

308
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,528
She needs to be taken care of!

309
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,203
Come on, out!

310
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,000
Thank you.

311
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,243
Good morning.

312
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,485
Well, now what's the matter?

313
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,849
Up, up child!

314
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,883
Nice, no?

315
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,648
Warm colours...

316
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,922
The nurses are lovely.

317
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,170
I would almost come to stay myself!

318
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,368
Where are the sockets?

319
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,248
Ah, there's one...

320
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,920
- But the lamp's plugged.
- It needs a double plug!

321
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,527
Surely there is one.

322
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,005
Found it! There you go.

323
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,718
- They're so organized!
- Aren't they?

324
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,004
Home is where the radio is.

325
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,926
It has changed my life!

326
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,249
Grandma...

327
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,640
I'll go call the head nurse.

328
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,842
Melissa!

329
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,766
Melissa, don't be sad.

330
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,007
Nothing will ever change between us.

331
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,161
You'll come visit
whenever you want...

332
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,719
...and I'll make you
a marvellous cup of tea.

333
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,848
You really don't mind being here?

334
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,288
"Paradise is where I am,"
your grandpa used to say.

335
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,120
A fantastically self-centred man!

336
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,245
Here we go.
Watch how it's done.

337
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,204
Let's get rid of this
shitty old lady blanket!

338
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,769
See?

339
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,846
It's something else entirely!

340
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,248
Doesn't take a thing.

341
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,441
Grandma! Grandma!

342
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,527
Don't cry, my treasure!

343
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,728
- It's not a goodbye!
- But you're the one who's crying!

344
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,609
Music!

345
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,838
Your favourites!

346
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,728
Risotto with mushrooms or paella?

347
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,849
Nothing.

348
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,918
Don't worry about me.
You only know how to hurt.

349
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,961
Sweetheart!
Why do you treat me like this?

350
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,440
What trouble did she give you?

351
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,807
You should be happy now.

352
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,644
Finally your ashtrays will be clean.

353
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,522
You're angry with me?

354
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,122
I adore Grandma!

355
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,600
Without her the house will be empty.

356
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,444
Believe me,
I'm sorrier than you are.

357
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,599
So let's go
and bring her back, now!

358
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,642
Sweetheart...

359
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,401
She'll be happier there.

360
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,240
I met her neighbours.
Really nice people!

361
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,684
Daddy would have never allowed it.

362
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,961
Yes, he would.
We decided it together.

363
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,723
Liar.

364
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,722
Melissa...

365
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,841
...stay with me for a while.

366
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,041
"Dear Diary, my mother is a monster.
And my father?

367
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,643
Did they agree?

368
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,767
I can't believe it.

369
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,087
But if it were true...?

370
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,561
I want to rebel
but there's nothing I can do.

371
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,129
I don't count."

372
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,598
How did it go with your grandma?
I'm in the movies with my mother.

373
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,760
Boring! MANU

374
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,008
"Now I'm alone.
Completely alone.

375
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,163
Rage, rage, rage.

376
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,804
Fury, rage, fury..."

377
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,082
I can't believe it!
There's the new guy, Marco!

378
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,844
He's gorgeous!
What do I do? Do I say hi?

379
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,883
Why don't you answer?
Okay...

380
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,759
Remember that asshole from Italian
interrogates us tomorrow. Ciao!

381
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,883
"Today is my birthday.

382
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,167
Mum gave me a present
that I'll never open.

383
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,878
Dad called when I was out
and did not try again.

384
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,564
To wak e up without Grandma
is horrible.

385
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,482
The house is empty without her."

386
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,083
No grades today.

387
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,442
We'll read the newspaper.

388
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,478
"According to a recent poll...

389
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,961
...seventy-five percent of Italians
are practicing Catholics."

390
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,358
"I am 16, I'm not a child anymore.

391
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,404
I want to be cruel to the world
as the world has been cruel to me."

392
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,448
May I interrupt
your makeup session, Titi?

393
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,399
Do you believe in something?
I, for example, I'm agnostic.

394
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,648
At home they all go to Mass.

395
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,360
So during Mass, do you also think
only of re-applying your makeup?

396
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:32,366
- The twins there, "roses and flowers"?
- We're pantheists.

397
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,168
Like Paris Hilton.

398
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,686
"It's simple:
Prov ok e, seduce, use...

399
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,569
...and throw away.
Everyone tak es what they want."

400
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,959
Do you believe?

401
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,199
In what?

402
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,248
In God, for example?
Are you religious at home?

403
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,048
My mother is...

404
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,962
...my father isn't.

405
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,643
I... I don't know.

406
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,040
But you have to believe
in something.

407
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,962
I'd like to think that there is a God.

408
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,565
To confide in someone
who always listens.

409
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,807
Rather, who already
knows everything...

410
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,927
...so you don't
have to explain anything.

411
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,842
Better than a diary!

412
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,239
It would be nice if there were a God.
God can never betray you.

413
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,764
But Daniele can!

414
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,040
If this was an immaturity test...

415
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,485
...you would pass with flying colours.

416
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,769
You still thinking about him?

417
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,320
If I were a boy I'd never let
a girl like you get away.

418
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,401
Would you have loved me?

419
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,569
Forever and ever.

420
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,926
I could smack him.

421
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,849
No, he did well.

422
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,287
- To treat you that way?
- Now I know who he really is.

423
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,569
It's easy to be like him.
Come! I'll show you.

424
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,405
Hello.

425
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,925
- Two milk shakes.
- Do you have Banana Splits?

426
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,523
No, I m sorry.

427
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,281
It's hot, no?

428
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,879
Do you like that guy over there?

429
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,803
- That guy? Are you crazy?
- Would you do him?

430
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,681
No way.

431
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,204
Me neither.

432
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,202
But he'd do me.

433
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,085
Do you see how he's looking at me?

434
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,558
No.

435
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,443
Here are the milkshakes.

436
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,207
Well, I'm going to make him crazy.

437
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,565
Wanna bet?

438
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,965
Cut it out!

439
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,804
This is what Daniele does.
Like me, look.

440
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,489
What's he doing?

441
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,482
He put his hand in his pocket.

442
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,563
- Why?
- Take a wild guess!

443
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,489
What do you want to do?

444
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,007
- I'm going!
- So am I.

445
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,284
Let's go!

446
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,964
See? Easy, no?

447
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,368
You're crazy!

448
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,601
Nobody will be able
to hurt me again.

449
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,444
I will defeat pain with rage.

450
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,927
I cut my face with a razor.

451
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,206
Hurt lik e hell, but I resisted.

452
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,849
I am strong.

453
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,878
I don't cry.
I don't cry. I don't cry.

454
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,405
Dad has finally called to say
he wasn't coming for Christmas.

455
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,528
WINTER

456
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,407
Elvira! Melissa!

457
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,084
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

458
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,809
You look fabulous!

459
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,359
Melissa, come quick,
Grandma's here!

460
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,000
Grandma!

461
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,763
Melissa!

462
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,280
My love, my love...

463
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,326
So, what happened to my armchair?

464
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,038
Don't you like that one?
It's much more comfortable.

465
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,484
It's ugly.

466
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,322
No, it's a very famous design.

467
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,526
One of Mrs. Adele's clients
suggested it!

468
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,601
How did you scratch yourself?

469
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,329
It's nothing...

470
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,608
What did you cook for me?

471
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,169
Hang on.

472
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,367
It's almost ready!
I just have to heat it up.

473
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,362
Soy sauce or chili sauce?

474
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,321
Tea first.
Will you make it for me?

475
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,162
- Apple tea?
- Yes.

476
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,003
So?

477
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,688
Melissa is having problems.

478
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,081
She's going through
a difficult time.

479
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,207
What are you talking about?

480
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,289
She seems very calm to me.

481
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,521
But do you ever look in her eyes?

482
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,683
Of course!

483
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,204
Melissa is still a child.
She doesn't even have a boyfriend.

484
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,325
I think you should keep
a closer eye on her. I know her.

485
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,288
Why, and I don't?

486
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,883
Here, Grandma.

487
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:31,010
- Nothing for me?
- Melissa.

488
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,528
My room!

489
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,090
She's turned it into a utility closet!

490
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:53,445
Just so you know,
food's on the table in six minutes!

491
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,927
I knew it was here!

492
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,800
Now I'm going to show you
something you've never seen.

493
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,919
I knew she wouldn't be able
to find it!

494
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,526
Good. Close the door.

495
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,198
Wow, Grandma!

496
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,327
You're stunning!

497
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,086
He wanted me like that.

498
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,808
- Grandpa?
- No, before.

499
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,207
I was just a little older than you.

500
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,599
Two...

501
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,329
...three...

502
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,242
...four...

503
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,560
...five...

504
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,643
We escaped to Paris together.

505
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,688
Were you in love?

506
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,683
Only at night.

507
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,445
He didn't understand me...

508
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,248
...just my body.

509
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,321
And I understood his.

510
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,724
During the day, I despised him.

511
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,680
But I couldn't live without him.

512
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,481
He cheated on me...

513
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,041
...he humiliated me...

514
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,646
...but then, with one kiss...

515
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,406
...l'd forgive him everything.

516
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,883
One night, he didn't come back.

517
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,724
He'd gone off with someone else.
Without a word.

518
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,964
But he had forgotten his gun.

519
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,882
I thought to myself,
"Do I shoot myself? Or him?"

520
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,801
But then I found myself
in front of a mirror...

521
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,126
...and I started to brush my hair,
like this...

522
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,363
...stroke...

523
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,040
...after stroke...

524
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,599
...after stroke...

525
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,404
My curls melted away...

526
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,482
How many are we at?

527
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,009
Thirty-four.

528
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,562
Why do we have to reach
exactly 100?

529
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:32,360
Because at the hundredth stroke...

530
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,883
...my hair was back to being straight.

531
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,129
I looked at myself.

532
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,360
He had no power over me anymore.

533
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,521
I was a different person.

534
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,727
Thirty-five, thirty-six...

535
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,918
...thirty-seven, thirty-eight...

536
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,319
...thirty-nine...

537
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,448
"Dear Diary,
another year has begun.

538
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,125
New Year, new Melissa.

539
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,490
I will kick anything that I don't lik e...

540
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,285
...and I'll find love, and pleasure...

541
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,919
...and tenderness, and passion..."

542
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,605
Yes?

543
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,203
It's Daniele.

544
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,928
- Hi.
- Just "Hi"?

545
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,206
- What am I supposed to say?
- For example:

546
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,405
"Long time no see!

547
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,959
- Where have you been, Daniele?"
- Right:

548
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,438
Where have you been?

549
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,805
And you?

550
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,564
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

551
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,482
Did you miss me?

552
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,482
I missed you.

553
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,208
Can I ask if you want
to come over, right away...

554
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,008
...to mak e love?

555
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,764
- You mean like last time?
- Much better.

556
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,238
I have a surprise for you.

557
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,249
Melissa...

558
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,763
...you still there?

559
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,079
Melissa?

560
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,249
Are you coming?

561
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,483
Yes.

562
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,442
Melissa...

563
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,366
You've really changed.

564
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,847
Is this the surprise?

565
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,239
No.

566
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,922
It's much better.

567
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,483
Close your eyes.

568
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,446
Now wait here. Don't move.

569
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,682
Sit still.

570
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,089
Daniele?

571
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,282
Keep your eyes closed!

572
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,808
Is he the surprise?

573
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,722
Why? Don't you like it?

574
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:57,050
I thought you wanted to be with me.

575
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,925
Wait. Wait.

576
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,480
Three is a good number.
You'll see, you'll like it.

577
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:06,358
I also have a surprise.
I'm leaving.

578
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,723
Don't be such a baby.

579
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,480
Baby?

580
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,008
Baby, huh?

581
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:22,679
So I'm just a baby?

582
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,761
One hell of a baby!

583
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,365
I'll show you
what kind of baby I am.

584
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,843
Why are you here?

585
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,799
Your girlfriend doesn't know
how to strip you like this?

586
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,280
Listen.

587
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,123
I've got an idea.

588
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,678
Come on.

589
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,081
Today I'll be your girlfriend.

590
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,809
Shut up.

591
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:38,363
Daniele and Arnaldo together?
Are you insane?

592
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,487
I don't know what happened to me.

593
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,484
At some point something
switched on inside me...

594
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,290
...rage, I wanted to teach them
a lesson...

595
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,726
...show them
that I'm not their little toy.

596
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,600
And you know something?
I liked it!

597
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,806
I don't know how to explain it.

598
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:56,961
I felt completely alive.

599
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,609
And...

600
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:01,724
...did you have an orgasm?

601
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:03,085
No.

602
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,130
I love you,
but you're wrong about this.

603
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,165
Those guys are gonna
go around telling everyone.

604
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,446
Promise me
that you won't do it again!

605
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,082
I love you too.

606
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:18,243
Melissa, what are you doing?
You're destroying your nails!

607
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:19,889
Please.

608
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,642
"I discovered sex-chats.

609
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,081
You don't suffer,
you enjoy yourself and that's it.

610
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,242
I'm Myself, I'm looking for someone
to have sex with anyone."

611
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,209
Melissa!
Why do you lock yourself in?

612
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,170
Could you help me
fold the tulle, please?

613
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:44,923
Fine! I'm coming!

614
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,245
"In the chat I can say
whatever comes to my mind.

615
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,287
Be everything I want to be.

616
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,929
I am free.

617
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,167
Manuela can't understand.

618
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,199
I'd lik e to tell her that I would fuck
the first guy who comes along.

619
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,122
Imagine her face."

620
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,720
SPRING

621
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,126
I WOULD LIKE TO BE
THE WOMAN IN THE PICTURE...

622
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,362
...AND THAT EVERYONE CAME
TO LOOK AT ME

623
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:10,920
"Dear Diary,
even I can't believe it.

624
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,849
Today I did it
with the museum custodian.

625
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:17,679
He took me to a hidden place
and we did it.

626
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:21,122
My body exploded with pleasure.

627
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:25,487
I don't know how he dared
but Daniele called me.

628
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:29,803
There was a small party at his place
with people I didn't know.

629
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:33,009
I let an older guy touch me...

630
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,842
...just to make Daniele jealous."

631
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,205
No, come on.

632
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:39,689
"Desire in the least
appropriate moments.

633
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,922
Now in class, I want to come
while the teacher is lecturing.

634
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:46,879
Today I'm 16,
I'm not a child anymore.

635
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,963
I feel different, freer, truer.

636
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,123
I'd like to talk to Manuela.
But anyway she doesn't understand.

637
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,565
She's there,
hiding under her layer of fat...

638
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,721
...afraid of her own shadow!"

639
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:03,689
Sorry.

640
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,483
And you?

641
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,203
You let them...

642
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,040
- What kind of friend are you?
- Me?

643
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:13,720
What was I supposed to do?
Hiding under my layer of fat.

644
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,448
Go fuck yourselves!

645
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,362
You too, Manuela!

646
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,606
"They think they know
everything about me...

647
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,761
...but they don't know anything.

648
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,481
They say I'm a whore?

649
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:38,684
I'll buy a sexy dress to show them
what kind of whore I can be.

650
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,087
I'm different than them.

651
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,639
I have the courage to be myself.

652
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,889
I'm done with Manuela.

653
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,529
Forever."

654
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,640
- Hello, Melissa.
- Good afternoon.

655
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:08,839
Grandma!

656
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:18,085
"Dear Diary, will someone
ever look at me that way?

657
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:21,723
Who will hold me lik e that,
with that much passion?"

658
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,484
Mom!

659
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:25,638
- Mom!
- Hello, sweetheart.

660
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,363
Everything okay?

661
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,159
Excellent!

662
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,765
I see you've finally dressed up.
What a lovely dress!

663
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,238
About time!

664
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:38,167
I'd lengthen it a couple of centimetres,
but the rest seems perfect.

665
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,685
- How much did you pay for it?
- Fifty euros.

666
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:44,081
What brought on this change?
Is there someone you like?

667
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,805
I'm going to study.

668
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,566
Melissa, wait for me!

669
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,838
Melissa!

670
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,284
Melissa, wait for me.

671
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,366
Can I give you a lift?

672
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,608
- I don't have a helmet.
- I have yours in the back!

673
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,008
I want to be alone.

674
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,279
Melissa, wait, I can explain.

675
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,608
I tried to stop them,
but I couldn't.

676
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,602
It was awful for me too!

677
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,048
Your mobile.

678
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,369
Hello?

679
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,398
Hi.

680
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,129
Where?

681
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:11,847
Arnaldo, here I am.

682
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,282
Daniele's not here?

683
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,083
Maybe.

684
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:20,809
Let's go.

685
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,689
Why this ugly place?

686
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,600
Because it's a nice place.

687
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,443
Come on!

688
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,689
Wait.

689
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,289
It's a game.

690
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,127
What am I doing here?

691
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,004
What a question.

692
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:18,839
Come on!

693
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:21,081
But why did you blindfold me?

694
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,487
Because you're a slut.

695
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:30,479
You do what I say
and you like it, right?

696
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,043
I want to leave.

697
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:49,848
Don't kid around.

698
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,845
- I don't want to do it anymore.
- Don't kid around.

699
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,643
No!

700
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,327
Get on your knees.

701
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:54,963
Down.

702
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,769
Down.

703
00:59:58,210 --> 00:59:59,768
Now do as I say.

704
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:01,803
One by one.

705
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,849
Like a pro.

706
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,639
"I gave myself
100 strok es of the brush.

707
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:35,244
It didn't work.

708
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:38,328
They didn't tak e away
the anguish nor the pain.

709
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:42,007
What do I care?
I don't need to forget.

710
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,559
No one can mak e me ashamed
of who I am."

711
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:51,087
- They're a bunch of cowards.
- I can't believe it!

712
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,127
It's unfair, it's unfair.

713
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,283
MYSELF: In my mouth
five different tastes of men met...

714
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,441
...five different flav ours.

715
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,961
What's your taste lik e?

716
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,769
ANYONE: Come to meet me
instead of always saying no...

717
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,444
...and I will squirt it
in your mouth too.

718
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,367
You're one of those
who talks and talks...

719
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:35,248
...but mak es it all up.

720
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:38,600
MYSELF: Where should I come?

721
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:44,083
ANYONE: Via Gianna Brezzi 25,
interno 13, tomorrow afternoon.

722
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:47,000
Or are you afraid of my taste?

723
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,441
ANYONE: You're the one
who should be afraid.

724
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:57,209
You'll see I don't mak e things up.

725
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,529
Melissa!

726
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:19,166
Melissa, sweetheart!
Come see what I brought you.

727
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,602
Melissa!

728
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,244
Hello.

729
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:46,998
Yes.

730
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,841
Here are the keys.
Your father said to wait for him inside.

731
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:53,318
Apartment 13.

732
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,807
Yes, I'm coming right away.

733
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:00,488
I'm coming.

734
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,729
Kiss, inside, always harder.

735
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:40,609
In my mouth, I lik e the taste of sperm.
Kiss my cock, penetration.

736
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,841
Put tongue, first time from behind,
sweet taste.

737
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:45,320
Chemistry classroom.
I don't want to be lik e my mother.

738
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:46,889
Five of them.
Suck ed them all.

739
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:50,645
Strong excitement. Bad grade.
Lik e a real slut. Pain, pain.

740
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,961
Chat man, I'm coming.

741
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,923
Melissa!

742
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:55,760
Open the boxes
and choose who you want to be

743
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,168
How is she?
Can I see her?

744
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,561
No, it's not possible. I'm sorry.
She's in intensive care.

745
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:07,880
Madam, please wait here.

746
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,682
Please, wait here.

747
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,444
Excuse me.

748
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:02,443
You must be Elvira's
daughter-in-law, right?

749
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:09,723
I'm a friend of hers.

750
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:15,088
You know,
she didn't even recognize me.

751
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,438
No.

752
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,003
Be brave.

753
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,329
Be brave.

754
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,889
Myself?

755
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:53,805
I'm sorry.
We did the best we could.

756
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,558
Thank you.

757
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:04,838
Myself?

758
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,849
Come out.

759
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,487
What have you done?

760
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:54,081
You've mixed everything up!

761
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:58,963
Choose.

762
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:03,369
You have to choose.

763
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,968
Disobeying?

764
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:09,407
Who do you think you are?

765
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,121
Myself!

766
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:16,843
Punish me!

767
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:27,528
Now it's my turn!

768
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,926
I want to go! Please, let me go!

769
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:08,639
Grandma!

770
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,043
Where is she?

771
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,767
I tried to call you.

772
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:30,320
I'll take you to see her later.
It's not scary, she's so beautiful.

773
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:31,764
Did she suffer?

774
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:34,603
Were you there?

775
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:38,088
No, it happened suddenly.

776
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:42,924
My love.

777
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,641
Last time I saw her...

778
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:06,924
...she was sitting on that bench.

779
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:12,286
There was a man with her.

780
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:15,966
He was talking to her about love.

781
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:19,808
Poor Grandma.

782
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:24,043
I didn't realize
how much I loved her.

783
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:27,319
I'll miss her cigarettes...

784
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:28,969
...her mess.

785
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,642
How could she?

786
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:39,166
She left me all alone.

787
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,728
I'm here with you!

788
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:48,007
I'm here!

789
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,762
I'm blind.

790
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:59,604
But Grandma saw so many things.

791
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:05,600
She knew that you...

792
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,286
What, Mom?

793
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:21,008
This...

794
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,481
Mom, did you read it?

795
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:26,529
Why?

796
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,721
You shouldn't have.

797
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:36,209
But those things you wrote,
are they true?

798
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:42,961
Not now, please, I'm asking you.

799
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:45,449
Please.

800
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:47,521
Are they true or not?

801
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:52,366
And if they're not...

802
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:56,358
...how did you ever imagine them?

803
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:01,202
Are they true?

804
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:12,126
Forgive me, baby.

805
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:18,729
Forgive me.

806
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:22,804
I didn't think
it was going to be so hard.

807
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:27,963
Forgive me.

808
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,281
But I'm here now.

809
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:46,004
SUMMER

810
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:00,649
"Dear Diary,
today is the last day of school.

811
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,528
Summer is starting."

812
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:15,122
Bullo.

813
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:18,404
Come here.

814
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,484
"Can one gesture cancel all?

815
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:25,448
Can one change at my age?

816
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:27,965
And do I really want to change?"

817
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:38,838
Melissa!

818
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,129
Come on!

819
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:47,925
I called you
when I heard about your grandma.

820
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:51,446
But as soon as I heard your voice,
I hung up. I didn't have the courage.

821
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:53,885
You can't imagine
how it's been without you!

822
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:57,042
I've missed you too!
So much!

823
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:01,448
Have you lost your mind?

824
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:04,683
With all the girlfriends I have,
I'm going to hit on yours?

825
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:08,002
- You piece of shit.
- You believe all the bullshit you hear?

826
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,205
Daniele...

827
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,122
...Lavinia told me.

828
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:19,762
Oh, she told you?

829
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:24,569
And did she also tell you
how she sat on my face, the bitch?

830
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:04,245
Arnaldo! We're not gonna fight
over a girl, right?

831
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:10,688
Hi, girls! Did you pass?

832
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:14,047
We're going to look now.
I flunked, I can feel it!

833
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,480
- All three passed!
- And me? Flunked, right?

834
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:46,198
- No, you passed too!
- That's awesome!

835
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:50,682
- I have to retake three. Assholes.
- Are you coming to Daniele's party?

836
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:53,239
You call it a party?
I'm not going there anymore.

837
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:56,243
- Daniele is.
- I don't care, I'm not going.

838
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:57,843
Flunked!

839
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:00,729
You're happy?

840
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,847
Yeah! I mean, no...

841
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:06,123
...not because I failed,
but because...

842
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:07,928
Because you're talking to me...

843
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,162
...for the first time.

844
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:14,529
Wait for me!

845
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:17,000
But yes, because I failed also.

846
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:20,526
- This way I can finally go to art school.
- You're leaving?

847
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:50,889
It's me?

848
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:53,928
But how did you do them?

849
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:55,967
I never even noticed!

850
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:07,249
This is when I fell in love with you.

851
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:12,159
You were there.

852
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:15,403
I remember.

853
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:21,160
Would you pose
for your first portrait?

854
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,638
My first one?

855
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:25,358
The first that you know about.

856
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,648
What a nice portrait.

857
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:24,959
- What are you doing here?
- I was looking for you.

858
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:28,247
There's a party at my place tonight.
No parents. It'll be awesome.

859
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:31,129
I'm tired of parties.
They're all the same.

860
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:34,522
All the same?

861
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:41,201
My parties are not all the same.

862
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:45,968
Come on, we'll have a blast!

863
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:48,519
- I don't feel like it anymore.
- Really?

864
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:49,998
Since when?

865
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:53,118
I know you.

866
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:55,804
"For the first time
he was looking at me...

867
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:57,881
...and I wasn't feeling anything.

868
01:23:58,130 --> 01:24:00,690
I didn't recognise myself
in his eyes.

869
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,241
He was telling me all the things...

870
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:09,924
...that I had longed to hear
for so long...

871
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,922
...and I couldn't care less."

872
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:15,082
I'm the only one who knows
how beautiful you are.

873
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:22,362
"I'll go to that stupid party.

874
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:26,885
I'll be strong enough
to show them all...

875
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:30,202
...that I don't care about
their little games anymore."

876
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:36,403
Melissa!

877
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:38,448
Melissa!

878
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:43,038
Come here!

879
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:46,043
Where are you going?
You have to stay with me!

880
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:07,882
"I've changed.

881
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,127
I wonder how Marco...

882
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,041
...would draw me now."

883
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:38,329
I'm really pleased.
You'll see how great it turned out.

884
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:41,403
I did my best so that
you could see it before leaving.

885
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:43,049
Ah, I picked your tickets up.

886
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:46,168
You have a stopover in Frankfurt
for a few hours, then Jiddah.

887
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:49,083
But did he say
if I'll be able to go on the platform?

888
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,446
Yes, he asked
for special permission.

889
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:54,081
I would love to go with you...

890
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:56,966
...but June is a wedding-filled month!

891
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:00,043
But why don't you ask Mrs. Adele
for a week off?

892
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:01,245
Sweetie!

893
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:03,208
Mrs. Adele has already been a dear.

894
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:05,918
She gave me two weeks off
to oversee the work here.

895
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:10,243
And Dad will be so happy to spend
time with you, just the two of you.

896
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,449
Mom!

897
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:27,199
You like it?
I found it in Grandma's room.

898
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:28,724
She was so beautiful.

899
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,245
She looks so much like you, sweetie.
