1
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
There. I'm done.

2
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,080
It'll do for now, but it goes back
to the dressmaker tomorrow.

3
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,680
I told her it was too long,
but she's so mule-headed.

4
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,800
Get me my necklace.

5
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,680
It's locked.

6
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,680
If you'll give me -
Never mind. I'll get it.

7
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,640
Go iron this scarf.

8
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm sorry
you're not coming, Anna.

9
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,040
It doesn't matter, Father.

10
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,360
When your mother gets an idea

11
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,640
in her head -

12
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
- Don't call her my mother.
- You see?

13
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,480
You're always hostile too.

14
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,400
She may not be your real mother,
but you treat her like a stranger.

15
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,640
You still address her formally
after ten years.

16
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,160
Ten years of hell.

17
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
You're right, Father.
Maybe it's my fault.

18
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,920
Anna, is my scarf ready?

19
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,840
Yes, here it is.

20
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,440
Hurry up. And get my gloves.

21
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Over there. Hurry.

22
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,320
Just what is your father doing?

23
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,000
Gaetano, hurry up
or we'll be late.

24
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm ready.

25
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,040
You might get a taxi
instead of dawdling.

26
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,160
There are plenty on the corner.

27
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,680
Anyway, what's the big rush?
It's only 8:30.

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,800
- Where's my fur?
- Right here.

29
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,160
Make sure all the windows
are locked and all the lights out.

30
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,800
All right.

31
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,600
Hello?

32
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,160
- Anna?
- Carlo!

33
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
When did you get in?

34
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,600
I just got off the train.

35
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,640
How are you?
I need to talk to you right away.

36
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,720
But how?

37
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,160
- At this hour?
- Are they asleep?

38
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,600
No, they went to the theater.

39
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, then?

40
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,760
I have to watch the place.
Let's meet tomorrow.

41
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,040
Tomorrow's impossible.
I have to go back tonight.

42
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,280
I have a meeting tomorrow.
I can't put it off.

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,280
I don't know.
A week or ten days.

44
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,480
That's why I want to see you.

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,440
Can't you come out
for just a minute?

46
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,560
Good girl.

47
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,640
I'll catch a taxi
and be right there.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,560
Anna, finally.

49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,560
I've been looking forward to seeing you.
You have to go right back?

50
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,680
Yes, to work out
final details in Rome.

51
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
The deal's done now.

52
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,000
It's been quite a struggle.

53
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,200
At one point I thought
it would all fall through.

54
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,160
But I convinced them,
and the business is getting underway.

55
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,560
What's wrong, Anna?
Why that look?

56
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,560
You don't look happy.

57
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Sure I am. I'm very happy.

58
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,240
I owe my success to you,
you know.

59
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,960
Me?

60
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,720
Whenever I felt discouraged,
I'd just think of you

61
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,640
and my strength and determination
would come back.

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,120
I felt you always with me.

63
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,360
Though you weren't there,
your eyes were watching me,

64
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,000
your voice spoke to me,
and I'd remember your words...

65
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,320
and our dreams and plans.

66
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Our dreams and plans...

67
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,360
Sweetheart, what is it?

68
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,040
Tell me what's wrong, darling.

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,760
What's happened?

70
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,600
Nothing.

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,160
It just all got to me
for a moment.

72
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,440
I don't really know.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's past now. Let's drop it.

74
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,680
No. Tell me.

75
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,480
I can't take it anymore, Carlo.

76
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,360
I can't go on.

77
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,360
Is your stepmother still
making your life difficult?

78
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,480
I need to feel you near.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,920
I can't go on being alone.

80
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,880
Try to understand.

81
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,720
Of course I understand.

82
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,400
I just didn't think things
had come to this point.

83
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,480
Why doesn't
your father do something?

84
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,760
I feel so sorry for him.

85
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,280
He suffers just seeing me suffer.

86
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,080
But he can't do anything.
He's almost scared of her.

87
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,560
Calm down now.

88
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,600
I've been looking forward
to being with you too.

89
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,040
But it's just a matter of days now.

90
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,000
Hold on a bit longer,

91
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,160
and then we'll get married.

92
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,760
Just our luck!
CANCELED DUE TO ILLNESS

93
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,400
I get a free box seat
and the tenor falls ill.

94
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm left standing here
like an idiot,

95
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,360
and it's your fault!

96
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,120
My fault? Did I make him sick?

97
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,320
- The lights are on.
- Where's Anna?

98
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,760
Your stupid daughter
left the lights on.

99
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
How odd.
She's always very careful.

100
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,360
Sure, and I pay
the electricity bill.

101
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,040
I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.
Anyone can forget.

102
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,440
Well, she's going
to hear about this.

103
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,360
Let the poor girl sleep.

104
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,640
She worked hard all day.
Tell her tomorrow.

105
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,400
And she'll say I made it all up!

106
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,560
Gaetano!

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
- What?
- Anna's gone!

108
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,960
- Good-bye, and hurry back.
- Yes, darling.

109
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
Go on now.

110
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,440
What's wrong? Won't it open?

111
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,800
I don't understand.

112
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Let me try.

113
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,360
The key turns.

114
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,080
The bolt must be drawn.
The bolt?

115
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,040
How could that be?

116
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,480
No one was home when I left.

117
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,440
Well, it's locked from inside.

118
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Ring the bell.
They'll let you in.

119
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,320
- Heavens no!
- Why not?

120
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,760
Now I understand.

121
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,680
They got home early,
and she bolted the door.

122
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,200
Why?

123
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,640
She did it on purpose,
so I'd have to ring

124
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,240
and give her another excuse
to lay into me.

125
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
You don't know what she's like.

126
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
Then we have to show her.
Let's ring.

127
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,480
No, wait.

128
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,520
You'll have to sooner or later.

129
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
Don't worry. I'll talk to her.

130
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,160
Relax.

131
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,320
Good evening, ma'am.

132
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,600
Welcome back.

133
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,040
Didn't expect us
to be home, did you?

134
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,360
Go on. If you'll allow me.

135
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,400
Forgive me, ma'am,
and you too, Mr. Ferrari.

136
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,880
Anna's not to blame.
I asked her to meet me.

137
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,160
So it was you?

138
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I needed to speak
to her urgently.

139
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,240
She didn't want to,
but I insisted.

140
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,880
Hear that?

141
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,800
I know you love
your daughter very much.

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,920
I'm sure we can reason things out.

143
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
My name is Carlo Guarneri.

144
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,880
I've known Anna for years,
and I'm a gentleman.

145
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,240
I've waited to introduce myself
until I could say,

146
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,560
"I have this position,
and I earn this much."

147
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,480
Anna and I want to marry.

148
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,360
That's not all you want!
If the door hadn't been locked,

149
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,760
you'd have brought him inside,

150
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,280
like you've probably done
with who knows how many others!

151
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,960
How can you think that I -

152
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,800
What are you waiting for?
Throw him out!

153
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,000
No need for that.
I'll leave on my own.

154
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,920
But I'll be back
to set this poor girl free.

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,520
Take her with you -
right now if you want!

156
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,200
But you'd best know one thing:

157
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,680
This is my house,

158
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,640
and everything in it is mine.

159
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
She owns nothing,
not even the dress she's wearing,

160
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,680
because my money paid for it.

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you were figuring
on some kind of dowry,

162
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,280
you'd best stop
dreaming right now.

163
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,080
Matilde, what are you saying?

164
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,360
Good riddance to both of them!

165
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,840
This house is no place
for a shameless hussy

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
who brings home
any man who comes along!

167
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,360
Let's go, Anna. Come with me.

168
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,920
I'm taking her with me now.

169
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,720
I won't let this hysterical
old woman insult her anymore!

170
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,280
Go on! Get out of here!

171
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,440
Out of my house!
Throw him out - and her too!

172
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,120
Come on, Anna.

173
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,720
Let's go!

174
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,080
Running off
in the night like that,

175
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,400
like some criminal.

176
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
What else could you do?
Go on putting up with her?

177
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,360
Now that I've met that woman,

178
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,760
I understand everything
you've been through.

179
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,280
You'll write to your father
from Rome.

180
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,240
Everything will work out.

181
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,760
Your mail, ma'am.

182
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,760
Dear Father,

183
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,400
I know I upset you.
Please forgive me.

184
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,920
I'm ready to apologize to your wife

185
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,920
and return home
until Carlo and I get married.

186
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,320
I eagerly await your reply.

187
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,880
Write me at Pensione Corelli,
via Palestro 51. Love, Anna.

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,720
Why doesn't he write back?

189
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,480
I may have hurt his feelings,
but I apologized.

190
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,760
Why is he treating me like this?
Don't worry.

191
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,480
Who knows what that woman's
telling him about you?

192
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,800
He could at least
write a few words.

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm his daughter, aren't I?

194
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,560
I'll write him again. Who knows?

195
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,520
Our new life is beginning.

196
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,040
Just you and me.

197
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:47,440
We don't need
anyone else to be happy.

198
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,120
You'll see.
Your father will come around.

199
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
You're so beautiful.

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,480
Look.

201
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,600
I made a list.
Where did I put that?

202
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,000
Here.
A list of everything we need.

203
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,000
Clothes, a place
to live, furniture,

204
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,240
a ring, witnesses,
food, and flowers.

205
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,440
All that will take a lot of money.
Do you have it?

206
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,240
- Not one lira.
- What will we do?

207
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
I'll soon have all I need.

208
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm meeting with my partner,
and I'll ask for an advance.

209
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,560
- Will he give it to you?
- Of course!

210
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,880
Good heavens! I've got to run.

211
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,400
We're meeting at 5:00.
I wouldn't want him to leave.

212
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,280
I'll come for you around dinnertime.
All right.

213
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,840
- Did you see him?
- No, we spoke on the phone.

214
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,440
He said he'd be here at 5:00.
I know.

215
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,080
But maybe I shouldn't be here.
Why?

216
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,240
I prefer to avoid him.
I'll set up a meeting for tomorrow.

217
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,360
He might catch on.

218
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,640
So what if he does?

219
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,880
I've got the upper hand here.

220
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,880
Then why wait?
Better to tell him now.

221
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,760
You're right.

222
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,600
The sooner we're rid of him,
the better.

223
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,600
- Want me to wait?
- No, I'll handle this alone.

224
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,680
Suit yourself.
But let's get one thing straight:

225
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,240
We've got the upper hand here.

226
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,800
Of course! Don't worry.

227
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,840
Look out. Here he comes.

228
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,040
- Hi, Rossi.
- Hi, Carlo.

229
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,760
- Can you wait a minute?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,160
I'll show you around.

231
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,440
- Nice office.
- This is all just temporary.

232
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,160
In fact, I'd like
your advice on furniture.

233
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,080
- All right.
- I'm really happy.

234
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,560
Cigarette?

235
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,040
What's going on?
I hear you called a few times.

236
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,720
- That's right.
- Something wrong?

237
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
No, everything's fine.

238
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,160
I just need a favor.
I'll do what I can.

239
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,440
Listen, the company's
set up now.

240
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
It'll be up and running soon.

241
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,360
Per our agreement,
I'll receive a salary

242
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,040
and a percentage.

243
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,120
You need a little money,
is that it?

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,880
Not a little - quite a bit.

245
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm getting married,
and I have a lot of expenses.

246
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,320
Those business trips ate up
all I had. I'm nearly broke.

247
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,480
- How much do you need?
- 300,000 lira.

248
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,560
A good sum.

249
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,000
I need it.

250
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,360
Take it out of
my partnership interest.

251
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,560
Your partnership interest?
That hasn't been settled yet.

252
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,120
You're the managing director.
You have full say on that.

253
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,360
Has something changed?
Come on, tell me.

254
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,720
Listen, I'll be very frank.

255
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,560
You have no grounds to claim
a part in this company.

256
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,400
- What?
- Let me finish.

257
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,160
You're an idealist.
For you, everything's simple.

258
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,800
But business is business.

259
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,640
It's my premises,
my organization, and my people.

260
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,360
Your friends put up the capital.
Naples provided the trucks.

261
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,520
What have you contributed?

262
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,680
What have I contributed?
How can you -

263
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,640
I brought it all together.

264
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,200
I found the investors
and put the business together.

265
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,640
You accepted
my conditions from the start.

266
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,040
Now you want to toss me out, eh?

267
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
At least be man enough
to tell me to my face!

268
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
Don't get excited.
You'll be paid a fee.

269
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,520
Let's talk this over calmly.
I'm not talking over anything.

270
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,880
Listen...

271
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,320
don't try to weasel out of this.

272
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,120
I trusted you,

273
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,400
but try and cheat me
and I'll break your neck.

274
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,040
- You got that?
- I got it!

275
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,680
Listen,
your threats don't impress me.

276
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,080
I told you where things stand.
If you don't like it, sue me!

277
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,000
That's what
lawyers are for, right?

278
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,440
To settle matters
between decent people.

279
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,440
Decent people?

280
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,880
You're a rat. A real scoundrel.

281
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,840
With people like you
I settle matters in person.

282
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,200
Enough.
You're getting on my nerves.

283
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,600
- Get out of here!
- No!

284
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,440
I'll smash your face in first,
you lousy crook!

285
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,640
Thief!

286
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,240
They're killing each other!

287
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,680
- What do I care?
- Let's see what's going on.

288
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,800
If that guy doesn't kill the boss,
someone else will.

289
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
Crook!

290
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,640
Sir!

291
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,920
- What?
- I heard a commotion.

292
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,200
I don't need anything. Go away.

293
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,440
All right.
Let's get this over with.

294
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
I don't want to discuss this further.
Neither do I.

295
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,400
How much to get you
out of my hair for good?

296
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,280
One million.

297
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,040
500,000. Take it or leave it -

298
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,480
Or kill you,
but I won't dirty my hands.

299
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,200
Fine.

300
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,000
No, no checks. I want cash.

301
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,600
I don't have it.
Come by tomorrow -

302
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,560
I know you have it.

303
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,000
I tell you - - Right now!

304
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,200
Very well.

305
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,560
As long as you
disappear for good.

306
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,280
Two, three...
and two more make five.

307
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,600
I hope you're happy.

308
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,720
You want a receipt?

309
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,120
This stone is perfect
in both cut and brilliance.

310
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,280
Yes, but it seems
a bit expensive.

311
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,240
Believe me, it's a deal.

312
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,840
You won't find a ring like that
anywhere at this price.

313
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,320
Fine. I'll take it.

314
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,960
Who are you? What do you want?

315
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,640
- Where's Carlo Guarneri?
- He went out.

316
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,760
- Search the other rooms.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,480
Come along, ma'am.

318
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,800
Who are you?

319
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,880
His fiancée.

320
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,920
Why? What's happened?

321
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,720
What are you looking for?

322
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,120
What do you want?
What's your name?

323
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,000
Anna Ferrari.

324
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,080
Where did your fiancé go?

325
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,920
I don't know.
He had an appointment.

326
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,440
Nothing in the other rooms, sir.

327
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,880
- Why all these questions?
- Police.

328
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,480
- What's happened?
- Take her away.

329
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,840
Come along.

330
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,280
- What have I done?
- The chief will tell you.

331
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
Just what I needed!

332
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,560
For the love of God,

333
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,320
tell me what's happened to Carlo.

334
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,040
What's happened?

335
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,280
You really want to know?
He killed a man.

336
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,840
Killed a man?

337
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,880
No, that can't be.

338
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,280
That's impossible!

339
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,320
- We got him, sir.
- Good.

340
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,520
He went back to the apartment.
Of course he denies it all.

341
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,960
Take her next door
for further questioning.

342
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,120
Come with me, miss.

343
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,720
It's not true!
I had nothing to do with it!

344
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,640
Get her out of here!

345
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,400
Wait for me at home!

346
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,440
Let him go.

347
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,280
Sit down.

348
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,720
Listen -

349
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,160
So you're Carlo Guarneri...

350
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,600
OWNER OF FURNITURE FACTORY
ROBBED AND KILLED

351
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,120
KILLER IN CUSTOD Y

352
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,480
Finally. Hello, Counselor.

353
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,560
Hello. Did they
question you again?

354
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,200
Yes, yesterday too.
Four hours in a row.

355
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,280
I can't take it anymore.
Always the same questions.

356
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,760
Aren't they convinced by now
that I didn't kill anyone?

357
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,840
Calm down and have a seat.

358
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,920
They questioned the jeweler.
He could testify.

359
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,920
Listen, I'll be frank.

360
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,080
I'm not the judge.

361
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,240
I'm just your attorney,
and you must tell me the truth.

362
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,840
You mean you think I -

363
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,560
There's too much evidence
against you.

364
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,400
Others heard you
shouting threats at him.

365
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,320
They said you had come to blows.

366
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
And you left with your pockets
full of cash

367
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,600
that even you admit was his.

368
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,680
- He gave it to me!
- Why?

369
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,680
He was buying me out.

370
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,600
Half a million just like that,
with no receipt? Come on.

371
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,320
Son, I have
your interests at heart.

372
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,360
If you help me, we'll find
some mitigating circumstances:

373
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,080
Provocation, heat of passion,
your clean record.

374
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,960
We'll find some way
to explain the cash too.

375
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,440
But to maintain your innocence
under these circumstances

376
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,760
is too risky.

377
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,720
But I am innocent.

378
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,920
I'm not interested
in mitigating circumstances.

379
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,440
I swear to God I'm innocent!

380
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,120
No judge could convict me.

381
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,080
Calm down.

382
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,640
You want to plead innocent?
Fine, we'll plead innocent.

383
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,880
- Which of you is Anna?
- I am.

384
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,000
Phone call. Hurry up.

385
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,360
Hello? Who's this?

386
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,320
Ah, it's you, Counselor.

387
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,240
They granted permission?

388
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,760
Thank you.

389
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,200
That's not allowed.

390
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,120
Forgive me if I seem choked up.

391
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,640
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

392
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Let me look at you.

393
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,680
You look pale and tired.

394
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,680
Poor Anna.
What I've put you through.

395
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,240
No, don't say that.

396
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm fine.

397
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,360
I'm perfectly fine.

398
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,760
It's just the shock
of seeing you in here -

399
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,040
Anna, don't cry.

400
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,200
This is a difficult time,
but it will pass.

401
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,720
I didn't do anything.
I didn't kill that man.

402
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,760
You believe me, don't you?

403
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,600
Yes, I believe you.

404
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,440
The court will have
to recognize it too.

405
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,400
They couldn't keep me in here
for a crime I didn't commit.

406
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,080
That would be awful!

407
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,000
That's why you must
have faith, Carlo.

408
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,720
Don't lose heart
or get discouraged.

409
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,920
I have so much faith in you.

410
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,160
You're right:

411
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,480
It's a difficult time,
but it will pass.

412
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,160
And we'll be happy like before.
Yes, just like before.

413
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,920
If you knew how much I think of you
during these endless days

414
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,240
and dreadful nights.

415
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,840
Without the hope
of seeing you again,

416
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
I couldn't hold on.

417
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,680
But tell me: What are you up to?
Where do you live?

418
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,520
Has your father gotten in touch?

419
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,960
Not yet, but -

420
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,560
I know. If that woman
hated you before, imagine now.

421
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,760
You mustn't worry about me.

422
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,960
I don't need anything.
I'm working.

423
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,000
Working? Where?

424
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,480
In a printing shop.

425
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,080
It's easy.
I got used to it right away.

426
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,320
But what about you?

427
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,760
I've waited so long
to see you again.

428
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,560
Help us, please.

429
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,400
It's nothing.

430
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,440
It happened once before too.

431
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
You mean...

432
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,160
Yes, I think so.

433
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,120
Our child.

434
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,440
Let them in,

435
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,240
but in an orderly fashion,
you hear?

436
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,760
I don't want any racket.

437
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,680
And don't sit on the beds.

438
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,600
Counselor, thanks for coming.

439
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,480
- How are we?
- Fine, thanks.

440
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,560
And the little lady?

441
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,560
All she does is nurse and sleep.

442
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,520
Does Carlo know?

443
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,560
Yes. He's beside himself
with joy.

444
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,760
He kissed and hugged me

445
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,440
as if it was my doing.

446
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,960
May I take
that beautiful little girl?

447
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,920
Come, little one.

448
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,320
I know he'd love to see her.

449
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,440
And he will.

450
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,320
He asked me to arrange things
with the warden.

451
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,680
He wants to marry you,
if you're willing.

452
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,120
Of course I'm willing!

453
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,840
Have you seriously considered
the consequences?

454
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,480
- What consequences?
- You'll be tied to him forever.

455
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
That's just what I want.

456
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,320
I thought as much.

457
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Why? What are you thinking?

458
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,000
Tell me.

459
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,680
Young lady,
I must speak to you frankly.

460
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,040
We hope he'll be proven innocent,

461
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,320
but what if he's convicted?

462
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,480
No, that's impossible!

463
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,200
Fine.
But let's just assume he is.

464
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,760
Have you considered your situation?

465
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,720
You'd be married to a man
locked up in prison

466
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,640
for many years.

467
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,600
We're not talking
about weeks or months.

468
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,880
Either he's acquitted

469
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,240
or he gets a long sentence.

470
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,000
You're young.
You can start over.

471
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,040
Sooner or later
you'd regret being tied to a man

472
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
you could never see.

473
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,680
I'll make up some excuse.
I'll say some problem came up.

474
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,360
No, don't say anything.

475
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,360
Don't make anything up.

476
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,080
If he wants to marry me,
I'm ready.

477
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,880
I promised to be his wife,
and I'll keep my promise.

478
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,200
Even the wife
of a condemned man?

479
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,800
Even the wife
of a condemned man.

480
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,320
In fact, all the more reason.

481
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,120
At least he won't have
to suffer alone.

482
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,720
He'll know
there's a woman who loves him

483
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,520
and who's waiting for him.

484
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,200
Carlo Guarneri,

485
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,040
do you take Anna Ferrari
as your lawfully wedded wife

486
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,600
according to the rite
of the Holy Catholic Church?

487
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,120
Anna Ferrari,
do you take Carlo Guarneri

488
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
as your lawfully wedded husband

489
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,360
according to the rite
of the Holy Catholic Church?

490
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,600
Thank you, Father.

491
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,000
May God protect you, my son.

492
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,600
May I? This is their present.

493
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,480
They all voluntarily
gave up a day's wages.

494
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,840
Thank you.

495
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,280
Congratulations!

496
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Carlo, be strong.

497
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,400
Thank you, Counselor.
I'm counting on you.

498
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,480
I'll be back soon.

499
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,720
Let's go.

500
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,280
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

501
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Will they render their verdict today?

502
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,040
Yes. After my closing remarks,

503
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,400
if the prosecution
has no response,

504
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,320
the court will most likely
render a verdict.

505
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,440
What do you think?

506
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,600
Don't worry.

507
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,000
The prosecution
and witnesses made me out

508
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,560
to be a common criminal.

509
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,880
They were all against me.

510
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,640
That doesn't matter.

511
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,800
The judges need only have
some doubt as to your guilt.

512
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,320
Let's hope.

513
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,560
I felt confident at first.

514
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,240
No, it can't happen.
I have faith.

515
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,280
- Of course. Don't worry.
- Where's Anna?

516
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,200
In church, praying for you.

517
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,640
Is Carlo's trial over?

518
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,440
Yes, it's over.

519
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,240
Then tell me:

520
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,560
Did they acquit him?
Are they letting him out?

521
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,560
Where is he?

522
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,760
I did everything I could
to save him.

523
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,160
He was convicted?

524
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,920
How long?

525
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,720
Twenty years.

526
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,960
Just one minute. That's my wife.

527
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,400
- All right, sir?
- Yes.

528
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,960
Darling!

529
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,160
- Good-bye, Anna.
- We'll meet again, Carlo.

530
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,440
You should go to bed.
At least you'd get some rest.

531
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,600
It's no use.
I'd never get to sleep anyway.

532
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,560
As you wish.

533
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,400
Who could that be at this hour?

534
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,840
Never mind. I'll get it.

535
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,200
- Gaetano Ferrari?
- That's me.

536
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,120
Hold on.

537
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,360
What is it? What's wrong?

538
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,240
What's that letter?
Who wrote you?

539
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
A lawyer in Rome,

540
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,520
on Anna's behalf.

541
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,760
Has she hired
a lawyer to sue us?

542
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,000
She got married.

543
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,400
She married that man.

544
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,680
Wonderful news!
You should be proud.

545
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
She has a daughter too.

546
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,760
Even better. A model family.

547
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,600
You knew nothing about this, right?

548
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Me? No! How would I?

549
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,360
Evil woman!

550
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,520
Anna's written many times,
but you never told me.

551
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,640
You hid her letters.
You're a monster!

552
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,960
A monster!
Calm down. Stop shouting.

553
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,160
You'd have hidden
this telegram too

554
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,240
if I hadn't gotten it first,
and I'd still be in the dark.

555
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,640
Read it.

556
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,800
Anna almost killed herself.

557
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,280
This lawyer's reminding me
of my responsibility as a father.

558
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,680
You understand?

559
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,200
Like I was
some unfeeling monster!

560
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,120
It's true! I destroyed her letters
so you'd never find out.

561
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,440
I make no apologies.
I obeyed my conscience.

562
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Don't forget
how she left this house.

563
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,200
She doesn't deserve
your love or pity.

564
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,560
If what I did was wrong,
I take full responsibility.

565
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,840
Now that you know,
you can do as you like.

566
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,680
You have every right
to bring her back here.

567
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,280
I'll leave right now if you want!

568
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,080
Do that! Get out!

569
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,680
You've been a curse on my life!

570
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,520
Get out!

571
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,200
This is the end.

572
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,520
Matilde, I beg of you...

573
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,680
send for Anna.

574
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,640
I must see her.

575
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,240
I already sent a wire.
She could be here tomorrow.

576
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,880
I won't last that long.

577
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,560
I beg you, Matilde...

578
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,360
tell her the truth.

579
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,480
I don't want her to think
I was that cruel.

580
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,040
All right, Gaetano.
I'll tell her.

581
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,080
And the little girl...

582
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,840
That poor, innocent child

583
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,760
isn't to blame.

584
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Don't turn your back on her.

585
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,440
Promise you'll help them.

586
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,240
Swear it.

587
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
I swear.

588
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,080
Get that crucifix.

589
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,080
Hurry. Get that crucifix.

590
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,440
You believe in the Lord.

591
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,480
You wouldn't break an oath

592
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
uttered before him.

593
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,000
Swear...

594
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,000
that you'll keep your promise.

595
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,200
Swear it.

596
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,280
I swear.

597
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,720
Help!

598
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,320
Come in.

599
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,600
Sit down.

600
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,400
Sit down.

601
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,320
I must fulfill a promise I made
to your father before he died.

602
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,120
He didn't wash his hands
of you when you left.

603
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,520
He did everything
he could to find you.

604
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,040
But I wrote him so many letters,

605
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,680
and he never answered.

606
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,800
Your letters didn't reach him.

607
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,720
He was very ill,
and the doctor forbade

608
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,120
any sort of excitement.

609
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,440
So it was you!

610
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,560
I should have known.

611
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Poor Father.

612
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,760
Think what you will.
I did my duty.

613
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,880
Wait. I haven't finished.

614
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,160
You married that man,
and you have a little girl.

615
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,360
He's in prison.
You're all alone in the world.

616
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,360
What will you do?

617
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,240
What I've done up to now:
I'll work.

618
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,560
What kind of work?

619
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,960
What are you implying?
I don't understand.

620
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,000
A young woman,
alone and in need,

621
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,320
can always find someone to pay.

622
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,360
What gives you
the right to insult me?

623
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,720
I didn't mean to insult you,
but life is as it is.

624
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,240
If you haven't done it yet,
sooner or later you will.

625
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,240
Don't tell me you'll be faithful
to a man locked up for 20 years.

626
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,160
What do you care anyway?

627
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,240
You're right.
I don't care what you do.

628
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,200
You alone are responsible
for your life,

629
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,720
and you deserve no pity.

630
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,440
But I made another promise

631
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,920
to your father,

632
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,440
and I mean to keep it.

633
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,080
He made me promise to look out
for that little girl's welfare

634
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,240
and not abandon her to her fate.

635
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,760
I will therefore welcome
your daughter into my home.

636
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,960
What? You'd concern yourself
with my daughter's welfare?

637
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,600
Yes, but only hers.

638
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,360
You are never to see her again.

639
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,360
Never see my daughter again?

640
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,040
No, that's impossible!

641
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,640
You can't ask me
to say good-bye to her,

642
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,560
the only treasure in my life!

643
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,520
Do as you wish.

644
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,840
I consider my oath fulfilled.

645
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,240
I wish to know nothing more
of you or her.

646
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,360
I have nothing more to say.

647
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,360
I have nothing for you, my child.

648
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,840
You need references!

649
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,680
- I have them.
- And a husband in prison!

650
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,640
- Nine hundred.
- Couldn't you make it more?

651
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,360
All right. One thousand.

652
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,560
This is the only job
I could find.

653
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,160
It's very hard work.
If you're interested -

654
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,960
Oh, yes!

655
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,400
Hurry up.
We open in five minutes.

656
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,520
You too. Hurry up.

657
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,600
Anna, you look so run down.

658
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,960
No, I'm perfectly fine.
It was probably just the trip.

659
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,280
Tell me: How's Ninuccia?

660
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,320
Fine.

661
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,800
But why did you write me
not to bring her?

662
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,640
I don't want her to see me
behind these bars.

663
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,480
She's getting bigger now.
I don't want her to understand.

664
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,080
But how are you?

665
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,240
How are you getting by?

666
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,640
In your letters
you talk so little about yourself.

667
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,600
I tell you everything, Carlo.

668
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,320
Sure. That you're fine
and need nothing, right?

669
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,200
God knows
how I wish that were true.

670
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,560
I'm afraid you're not
telling me the truth.

671
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,080
It's the truth. I swear.

672
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,840
- But just looking at you -
- I told you.

673
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,760
It was the trip.

674
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,320
I traveled all night.

675
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,800
But how are you?

676
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,520
Fine.

677
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,640
I'm working.
Otherwise I'd go crazy.

678
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,320
- Have faith, Carlo.
- No.

679
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,960
I no longer
have faith in anything!

680
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,840
Don't say that.

681
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,760
I need faith to keep going too.

682
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,640
Otherwise I'd never make it.

683
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,960
I always say I don't need
anything, and it's true.

684
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,400
But if you talk like this,
then I have nothing!

685
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,480
You're right. Forgive me.

686
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,080
I should be the one
lifting your spirits,

687
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,600
yet here you are...

688
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,280
Time's up.

689
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,320
Write me often.

690
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,280
I think of you always -
both of you.

691
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,720
Good-bye, Anna.

692
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,760
Good morning, Mommy.
How are you?

693
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,040
Little goldfinch,
who are you waiting for tonight?

694
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,280
Can't you see?
I opened your cage.

695
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,120
Reginella's flown off
You do the same.

696
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,440
Take flight Sing and cry no more.

697
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,160
Find yourself
a more faithful mistress.

698
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,840
More worthy of hearing your song.

699
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,520
Our love is no more.

700
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,040
But every once in a while.

701
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:29,760
You absentmindedly call my name.

702
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,160
- Four martinis.
- May I?

703
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,920
Two cognacs.

704
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,240
Anna?

705
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,240
It is you!
Don't you remember me?

706
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,960
Enzo. We were
at the conservatory together.

707
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,640
I remember.

708
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,560
Imagine running into you
after all these years!

709
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,560
What's this? I don't understand.

710
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,560
Enzo, they want another song.

711
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,960
I must see you again.
I'll be back.

712
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,960
Tell your friend.

713
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,880
That I can't sleep
and life's gone drab and gray.

714
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,120
That I think of her always.

715
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,480
For she's my whole life

716
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,040
I'd like to tell her so myself.

717
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,080
But I can't find the words.

718
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,400
I love her.

719
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,720
I love her so much.

720
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,120
Please tell her.

721
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,680
That I'll never forget her.

722
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,760
This passion I feel.

723
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,320
Is stronger than chains.

724
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,560
For it torments my soul.

725
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,520
Until I can't go on.

726
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,760
A glistening tear falls
from your eye.

727
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,200
Tell me.
What are you thinking of?

728
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,480
For your sweet eyes.

729
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,840
Look at me but do not speak.

730
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,760
Let's take off these masks.

731
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,960
And tell each other the truth.

732
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,160
I love you.

733
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,240
I love you so much.

734
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,240
You are that chain.

735
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,560
That can never be broken.

736
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,520
O my sweet dream.

737
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,800
My body's fervent desire.

738
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,680
I need you
like the air I breathe.

739
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:18,960
Without you I can't go on.

740
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,720
That's why I do it.
I have to work to get by.

741
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,800
Couldn't you find
more suitable work?

742
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,160
I looked and looked.

743
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,160
But you think it's easy
in my situation,

744
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,120
with a husband in prison?

745
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,760
When you have to,
you take what you can get.

746
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,480
- And your little girl?
- I leave her with the landlady.

747
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,040
But enough about my troubles.

748
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,320
You're a big success now.

749
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,800
A success...

750
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,280
Remember those concerts
we'd go to?

751
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,800
I wanted to be a composer
or conductor, but here I am...

752
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,080
- But you earn a lot.
- Sure...

753
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,200
and I gave my dreams
a first-class funeral.

754
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,320
Seeing you again
has brought them all back.

755
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,760
You were in my most
beautiful dream, you know.

756
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,600
I was?

757
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,200
That one took the longest to die.

758
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,640
I've always remembered you
as you were then:

759
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,160
Happy, carefree, laughing.

760
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,280
I loved seeing you laugh.

761
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,960
I was happy then.

762
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,480
That was so long ago
that I can tell you now:

763
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,520
I was in love with you.
You probably didn't even notice.

764
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,600
I hid it from you,

765
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,880
afraid you'd just go on laughing.

766
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,000
I get out here.
That's where I live.

767
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,800
Stop.

768
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,720
Shall I see you to your door?
No need for that.

769
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,000
Who knows what they'd think
seeing me drive up in a carriage?

770
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,200
Anna, is there anything
I can do for you?

771
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,200
No, thank you.
I don't need anything.

772
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,280
How can you say that,
with the life you're living?

773
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,000
You must think of me
as a brother.

774
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,120
You'd accept help from a brother.

775
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,800
Yes, but you're not my brother.

776
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,080
Isn't it the same thing?

777
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,480
No, Enzo...

778
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,720
brothers and sisters have
the same father and mother.

779
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,200
Other relationships always
turn into something else.

780
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,120
But I assure you - - I know.

781
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,400
You've spoken to me
as if to a sister,

782
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,120
and I appreciate it.

783
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,280
Good-bye.

784
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,680
Not, not good-bye. See you soon.

785
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,880
You can't refuse me this favor.

786
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,280
But what else can
a kitchen maid do?

787
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,960
Kitchen maid?
She's from a very good family.

788
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,000
We were
at the conservatory together.

789
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,360
And she's beautiful too. Really?

790
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,840
First time I've overlooked one
right under my nose.

791
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,720
I wasn't implying
what you're thinking.

792
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,560
I'm not thinking anything.

793
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,160
And if you're so interested,
I'd never dare -

794
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,120
You better not.
Now, what else do you have for her?

795
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,640
Hatcheck girl.

796
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,760
I'll fire the current one and put
your friend in that low-cut uniform.

797
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,640
But don't forget your promise:

798
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,640
You won't sing
anywhere else next season.

799
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,600
I promise.

800
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,400
Now let's go meet
this wellborn kitchen maid.

801
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,080
No, not now.

802
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,520
I have another favor to ask.
Another one?

803
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,520
She mustn't know
I was behind this.

804
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,720
Send for her as if it was
your own idea -

805
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,480
I understand.

806
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,040
No, you don't,
and you never will.

807
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,920
Just do as I say.

808
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,400
And pay her an extra 10,000 lira
each month. I'll reimburse you.

809
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,160
But my name
must never be mentioned.

810
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,880
Very well.

811
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,720
I cry tears of love
and they fall in a vase.

812
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,480
And water a rose growing there.

813
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,400
A beautiful rose blossoms.

814
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,080
And I send it to her
who causes my tears

815
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,840
I tell the little rose
"Forgive me.

816
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:41,240
If she thoughtlessly
crushes you underfoot".

817
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,560
There's a saying
that makes my point.

818
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,480
"If you do somebody good,
think no more about it.

819
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,800
But if you harm someone,
give it careful thought".

820
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:05,600
Yes, give it
very careful thought.

821
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,160
I love you.

822
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,720
Yet all you do.

823
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,240
Is make me suffer.

824
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,240
- Anna, my coat and hat, please.
- Right away.

825
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,000
- So you're leaving town?
- I have to.

826
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,320
I didn't think
you'd be leaving tonight.

827
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,720
I've stayed
an extra day as it is.

828
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,960
- Milano or Torino first?
- Milano.

829
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,120
- How long will you be gone?
- A few months.

830
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,520
- I'm sorry you're going.
- Me too.

831
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,440
I hope to find you
in calmer spirits when I return.

832
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,600
Thank you, Enzo.

833
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,480
If you should need me
for any reason,

834
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,760
at the Albergo Marino
they always know where I am.

835
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,160
Good luck.
I hope we meet again soon.

836
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,680
May I?

837
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,760
Ah, it's you. Come in.

838
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,360
What can I do for you?

839
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,480
Forgive me, sir,

840
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,960
but I just received my paycheck.

841
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,320
I think there may be
some mistake.

842
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,360
Isn't it enough?
Aren't you happy?

843
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,840
Yes, I'm happy.
I just don't understand.

844
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,360
An additional amount
was added with no explanation.

845
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,920
Don't try to figure it out.

846
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,960
Consider it a newcomer's bonus,

847
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,600
a token of management's affection.

848
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,320
You're a very charming
and likeable woman.

849
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,560
It's amazing.

850
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,880
All this time in our employ
and I'd never noticed you.

851
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,320
It's understandable.

852
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,480
You never had reason
to go in the kitchen.

853
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,520
What lovely hands.

854
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,280
Poor things.

855
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,120
How they must have suffered
in that dishwater.

856
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,000
- You get used to anything.
- No, it's not right.

857
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,000
A lovely woman like you
deserves much better.

858
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,960
As I said, I'm very grateful
for this new position.

859
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,560
Yes, but I really could do more...

860
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,240
and I'd like to.

861
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,960
You should be wearing furs,
not taking them off other women.

862
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,000
What are you saying?

863
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,800
With such lovely arms
and shoulders,

864
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,080
and a body like yours -

865
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,600
Why back away?
Do I frighten you?

866
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,200
No. Forgive me. I must go.

867
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,160
Wait. Why rush off?

868
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,160
Let's get to know
each other better.

869
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I know you're all alone.

870
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,200
A lovely young woman on her own
needs someone to look out for her.

871
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,320
Thank you,
but I don't need anything.

872
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,320
Come now. Don't be like that.

873
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,400
If you like,
we could be good friends.

874
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,840
I like you very much.

875
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,720
Let me go, please!

876
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,840
Come on.
I'm not used to begging.

877
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,600
Now I understand.

878
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,080
That's why I got a bonus!

879
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,600
Well, you can have it back!

880
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,560
I want nothing from you!

881
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,160
Go on, you rude thing!

882
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,680
Go back to being a kitchen wench.
That's your calling.

883
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,840
But not here!

884
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,200
You're finally back.

885
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,120
What's wrong?

886
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,520
Ninuccia!

887
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,280
Let her be. She just fell asleep.
She has a fever.

888
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,680
She wandered into my room

889
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,960
barefoot and burning up
with fever.

890
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,040
I put her back in bed
and stayed with her.

891
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,120
I'm going back to bed.

892
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,560
Thank you so much.

893
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,480
I'm sorry.

894
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,360
How is she? What did you find?

895
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,120
No change. No better, no worse.

896
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,040
Then what now?

897
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,800
I've told you:
Her health is gradually declining.

898
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,720
It's not serious yet,
but if it's not caught in time,

899
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,360
there could be
serious consequences.

900
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,480
This girl needs
a lot of attention.

901
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,160
Continue with the medicine
I gave you.

902
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,000
If she doesn't improve,

903
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,520
she should be put
in a sanatorium.

904
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,840
- A sanatorium?
- That's right, my dear.

905
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:30,480
This must be treated in time
to avoid dire consequences.

906
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,240
A sanatorium...

907
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,360
A sanatorium...

908
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,040
I'll welcome your daughter
into my home...

909
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,920
I'll welcome your daughter
into my home...

910
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,840
I'm desperate.

911
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,480
I don't know where else to go.

912
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,200
She's sick and has a fever.

913
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,120
I've done everything I could.

914
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,320
Believe me,
I've done everything!

915
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,360
Oh, I believe it.

916
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,440
I'm begging on bended knee:

917
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,480
Save my daughter!

918
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,520
I know you hate me,
but she's done you no wrong.

919
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,240
She's not to blame.
You can't hate her.

920
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,920
Leave us, Rosina.

921
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,800
Get up.

922
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't hate you.

923
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,760
It's you who hated me
from the start,

924
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,000
and you turned your father
against me too.

925
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,720
You rebelled against me?
Too bad.

926
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,320
Now look what
you've been reduced to.

927
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,640
Her forehead's damp.

928
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,720
Her temperature
always goes up at night.

929
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,240
Prepare the room
at the end of the hall.

930
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,120
Better put her to bed.

931
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,080
Give her to Rosina.
You're tired.

932
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,880
Mommy, I'm sick.

933
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,680
No, sweetheart.
Come with Rosina.

934
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,480
Thank you!

935
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,120
Listen carefully, Anna.

936
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,960
I'll still welcome
your daughter into my home,

937
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,160
give her an education,

938
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,880
and bring her up
in a decent household.

939
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,560
All I have will be hers.

940
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,680
But on one condition:
You are never to see her again.

941
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,960
You're to know nothing
more of her, nor she of you.

942
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,160
Just as if you were dead.

943
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,080
Have pity on me!
Don't take her from me!

944
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,400
I'll be your servant.
I'll do anything.

945
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:30,360
But let me stay
with my daughter.

946
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,760
She's all I have.

947
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,320
You don't know
what her kiss means to me.

948
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,680
It's everything to me!

949
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,720
Don't say no.

950
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,840
Impossible.

951
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,000
I never had a mother.

952
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,520
I've always been on my own.

953
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,680
Ninuccia is the light
in my eyes.

954
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,400
Take her away
and you leave me blind.

955
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,240
Have a heart!

956
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,800
I've told you:
Those are my conditions.

957
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,680
She's to know nothing more
of you or her father.

958
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,080
Your husband's
locked up in prison,

959
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,120
and you are to agree
to be locked up

960
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,400
in a home for wayward women.

961
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,680
A home for wayward women?

962
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,040
Why?

963
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,240
What am I? A prostitute?

964
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,240
What have I done
to be locked up like that?

965
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,760
Dear Jesus!

966
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,520
I don't know what you've done,
nor do I wish to.

967
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,280
That's a matter for you
and your conscience alone.

968
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,440
Either you accept my terms

969
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,120
or you can take
your daughter and leave.

970
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:47,800
No, I can't do that!

971
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,800
As you wish.

972
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,080
But what will you do?

973
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,560
One day your daughter
will begin to understand

974
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:08,400
and ask
why she has to suffer so.

975
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,800
How will you answer her?

976
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,640
Children are merciless judges,

977
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,280
and one day she'll blame you

978
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,000
for bringing her into this world.

979
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,640
All right.

980
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,080
Come in.

981
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,840
Mother Superior called.
She's expecting her.

982
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Tell Anna.

983
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:53,280
Mommy has to go away
for a few days.

984
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,040
Be a good girl.

985
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,640
No, you have to stay here.

986
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,680
Be good now. Mommy has to go.

987
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,040
But she'll bring back
lots of nice things for you.

988
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,040
I don't want nice things.
I want you!

989
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,520
Come now, Ninuccia. Don't pout.

990
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,800
You'll make Blessed Mary cry.

991
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,600
Don't leave me.
I want to go with you.

992
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,200
All right.

993
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,960
Mommy will leave for just
a minute and come right back.

994
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:32,000
And later she'll take you
to the puppet show.

995
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,240
You like the puppet show?

996
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,280
Yes, but I don't want
to stay here alone.

997
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,920
But you're not alone.

998
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,960
Rosina's here.

999
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,200
She loves you very much.

1000
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,640
She'll tell you
the story of Snow White.

1001
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,160
Won't you, Rosina?

1002
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,600
Rosina,
what are you waiting for?

1003
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,800
Take the child.

1004
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,360
Let's go. We're late.

1005
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,480
I'm coming.

1006
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,040
See you very soon, Ninuccia.

1007
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,720
Rosina, take her.

1008
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,040
HOME FOR WAYWARD WOMEN

1009
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,120
She's made many mistakes
and has suffered much for them.

1010
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,480
I wish to help her
find redemption.

1011
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,440
I'm doing this
for the salvation of her soul.

1012
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,600
Cut off from the world,
in this place of atonement,

1013
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,840
home to other unfortunate
souls like herself,

1014
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,920
she can demonstrate
the sincerity of her remorse.

1015
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,520
Is this what you wish?

1016
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,360
Yes.

1017
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,840
You'll live a life
of rigorous discipline.

1018
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,560
The unfortunate souls here
must submit

1019
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,920
to a life of renunciation,
work, and prayer.

1020
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,640
Are you sincerely
ready to do this?

1021
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,320
Yes, Mother.

1022
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,960
You must renounce
all ties to the past

1023
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,760
and have no further contact
with the outside world.

1024
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,720
It's a serious commitment.

1025
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,520
Are you ready to take it on?

1026
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,920
Answer.

1027
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,520
You must decide.
No one's forcing you.

1028
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,160
You can say no if you wish.

1029
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,520
- Is that how you do your exercise?
- I'll finish it right away.

1030
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,680
Look what you've done
to the table.

1031
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,720
And look at this mess!

1032
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,880
You're a filthy little thing!

1033
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,600
Rosina.

1034
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,320
Clean her up and put her to bed.

1035
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,160
Why hasn't Mommy come back yet?

1036
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:58,240
Be good. She'll be back soon.

1037
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,520
Go to bed now and sleep.

1038
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:03,240
How can I
if I haven't said my prayers?

1039
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,360
Then say them now.

1040
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,840
Dear Jesus,
I promise to always be good.

1041
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,880
Please keep Mommy
and Daddy safe...

1042
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,280
and Signora Matilde too.

1043
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,640
Hurry up, girls.
Don't waste time.

1044
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,640
Make your beds. Hurry up now.

1045
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,560
Hurry up, Anna. Get dressed.

1046
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,200
Leave me alone! Get off my back!

1047
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,880
Some manners!

1048
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,920
She's always like this
in the morning.

1049
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:46,480
And worse as the day goes on.
What did we do to you?

1050
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,600
I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you.

1051
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,880
We've all had troubles
as bad as yours or worse.

1052
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,320
She's right.
Don't let it get you down.

1053
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,000
Do like I do.

1054
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,800
I put it all behind me
and never give it another thought.

1055
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,560
You can all accept things here,
but not me.

1056
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,680
Why should you be the only one?

1057
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,440
I have my reasons.

1058
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,200
Come on.
The others are already downstairs.

1059
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,160
If Mother Celeste
finds us up here -

1060
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,520
What do I care about her?

1061
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,240
What can she do to me
that they haven't already done?

1062
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,360
I wish they'd just kill me.

1063
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,480
At least I'd be free!

1064
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,280
Stop shouting!

1065
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,080
Let's go.

1066
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,480
You girls go if you're afraid.

1067
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,520
I'm not afraid,

1068
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,200
and I'll tell Mother Celeste so
to her face.

1069
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,400
She hates me, and I know it.

1070
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,440
Well, I hate her too,
because she's wicked, cruel,

1071
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,600
and heartless.

1072
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,000
- Are you speaking of me?
- Yes.

1073
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,640
You heard what I said,

1074
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,040
and if not, I'll repeat it:

1075
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,120
I hate you!

1076
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,560
You think I didn't understand?

1077
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,680
Everyone's unhappy here,
straining at the leash,

1078
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,000
but they've all learned
to go along.

1079
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,640
You're the only one
who never stops fighting,

1080
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,440
who'll never repent
for all the evil she's done.

1081
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,480
It's true.

1082
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,920
I don't repent.

1083
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,280
What do I have to repent for?

1084
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,040
What am I guilty of?
We forget quickly.

1085
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,160
I've forgotten nothing.

1086
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,080
I've done nothing,
yet I'm locked up in prison.

1087
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,120
- Prison?
- That's right.

1088
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:34,160
Oh, it's not the iron gates
and the bars on the windows.

1089
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:38,880
If I wanted to escape,
I'd crawl like an ant over the wall

1090
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,240
or slither under the door
like a worm.

1091
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,240
But I can't.
I don't want to escape.

1092
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,840
I have to stay and suffer in here,

1093
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,840
where no one sees my anguish.

1094
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:56,120
Not even you,
who think you see everything.

1095
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,800
That's enough now.

1096
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,960
No, let her speak.

1097
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,400
She's a wicked,
ungrateful woman.

1098
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,960
And why should I be
grateful to you?

1099
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,040
Never a kind word,

1100
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,120
never a single word
of understanding!

1101
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,080
Mother, huh?
They call you " mother."

1102
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,360
Holy Mother,

1103
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,240
why let someone like her
use that precious name?

1104
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,600
That's enough now!

1105
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,040
Quiet!

1106
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,800
Stop this!

1107
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,880
What is it?

1108
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,680
- What's going on?
- The usual.

1109
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,440
This girl's more rebellious
by the day.

1110
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,960
Anna, what have you done?
Apologize.

1111
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,040
Would you defy me too?

1112
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:45,680
Yes, I'll defy every one of you!

1113
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,000
Let's go, girls.

1114
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,960
You too.

1115
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,360
You don't know
what you're saying, my dear.

1116
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,800
Come now. Don't cry.

1117
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:16,600
I swore before our Lord
I'd be a sister and counselor

1118
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,920
to all those girls
tossed about by fate

1119
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,480
and separated from God.

1120
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,560
He sees all...

1121
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,280
and forgives all...

1122
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,240
as long as one
sincerely repents.

1123
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,360
Forgive me, Virgin Mary...

1124
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,000
you who were a mother too.

1125
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,080
Good news?

1126
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,000
My lawyer.

1127
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,080
Always the same thing.

1128
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:03,920
He's continuing his investigation,
but he has no news yet.

1129
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,520
Get used to it
and stop tormenting yourself.

1130
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,040
In all these months

1131
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,760
has she never felt the urge
to write me even once?

1132
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,120
It happens to all of us.

1133
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,280
They forget us like we were dead.

1134
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:25,040
Besides, you can't expect
a woman to stay tied

1135
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,280
to a poor louse in prison.

1136
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,240
She's my wife!

1137
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,920
She can't have just forgotten me.

1138
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Don't fool yourself.
Listen to me.

1139
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,040
Forget her right back.

1140
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,960
And our little girl?

1141
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,680
She's my flesh and blood.

1142
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,920
My dear mommy!

1143
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,840
Mommy, is it true
what that woman says,

1144
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,200
that you don't love
Ninuccia anymore?

1145
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,280
I don't believe it.

1146
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,760
I want you
to come back right away,

1147
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,080
because I'm all alone.

1148
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:30,280
I'm so afraid, and I want
to sleep in your arms.

1149
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,400
Come here.

1150
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,480
Who took the picture
that was in here?

1151
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,040
- I don't know.
- You don't?

1152
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,840
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

1153
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,000
Liar!

1154
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,840
No, that's my mommy!

1155
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,600
I told you to forget
about your mother.

1156
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:02,280
She's never coming back
because she was very bad.

1157
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,800
You're the bad one. Meanie!

1158
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:09,040
You're a little snake.
Like mother, like daughter.

1159
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,800
Come on.

1160
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,960
Don't put me in that dark room!
I'm afraid!

1161
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,680
The home for wayward women? Why?

1162
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,720
It was that woman's idea.

1163
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,400
Poor Anna.

1164
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,800
Now I see
why I couldn't find her.

1165
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,520
And her daughter?
That poor innocent thing!

1166
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,680
She cries for her mother
all day long.

1167
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:35,200
- They can't ever see each other?
- Never!

1168
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,080
We have to do something.

1169
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,680
I know.
But try to talk to that woman.

1170
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:45,680
If she found out they'd seen
each other, she'd turn the child out.

1171
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,160
Doesn't she ever go out?

1172
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,240
She has dinner at her sister's
every Saturday

1173
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,480
and has me watch the girl.

1174
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:56,120
- Then we'll take that opportunity.
- At night?

1175
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,440
And how will her mother get out?

1176
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:14,120
For you. Don't let anyone see.

1177
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,360
Careful.

1178
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:27,840
Anna, I've arranged with the guard
to let you out tonight.

1179
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,120
Your little girl needs you.

1180
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,600
Meet me at the church
at 10.00. Enzo.

1181
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,800
Where are you going?

1182
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,760
Trying to escape?

1183
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,120
Why not do as you said?

1184
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,720
Now's the time

1185
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,040
to crawl over the wall
like an ant

1186
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,200
or slither under the door
like a worm.

1187
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,600
Why are you so cruel to me?

1188
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,160
Should I let you
run off to your lover?

1189
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,640
No, Mother Celeste.

1190
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,240
It's not what you think.

1191
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,280
I have a little angel
of a daughter,

1192
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,280
and she wants to see me.

1193
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,160
She needs me.

1194
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,920
I have to go to her.

1195
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,080
But why try to explain?

1196
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,440
You'd never understand.

1197
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,440
You can't know

1198
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,600
what it means to be a mother.

1199
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,680
"Mother"?

1200
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,320
But I do understand.

1201
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,560
And every time I hear that word,

1202
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,640
it's like a knife in my heart,
and I can't bear it anymore.

1203
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:04,040
What is your suffering
next to mine?

1204
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,800
Don't you see the life I live?

1205
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,440
My flesh is covered with bruises.

1206
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,200
Days and nights spent in penitence.

1207
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,480
Yet I committed no sin.

1208
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:20,080
I had a daughter too, like you,

1209
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,560
and I lost her.

1210
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,200
She was all I had.

1211
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,160
I see so many people
who live only for evil,

1212
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:35,280
yet my little saint lives no longer.

1213
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Mother Celeste, forgive me.

1214
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,880
I didn't know.

1215
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,440
That's enough now.
Come back inside.

1216
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,280
Mother Celeste...

1217
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,640
I don't know
your daughter's name,

1218
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,960
but she needs no name now.

1219
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:58,400
She's a little angel now,
like so many others,

1220
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,680
and I turn
to that little angel now

1221
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,800
and call to her.

1222
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,960
Beloved little angel,

1223
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,680
so close to God in heaven,

1224
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,240
look down and see
this mother here on earth

1225
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,480
who wishes to see
her daughter but can't

1226
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,720
because your mother
won't let her.

1227
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,480
Beloved little angel,

1228
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,680
speak to her.

1229
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,320
Ask her for me.

1230
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,960
You live in her heart.

1231
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,240
She can't say no to you.

1232
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,000
Go.

1233
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,560
Go.

1234
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,360
Thank you.

1235
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,680
Go see your daughter.

1236
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,040
Why doesn't Mommy come?

1237
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,200
She'll be here any minute.

1238
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,400
Cover up and don't catch cold.

1239
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,760
Hold on. Come here.

1240
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,160
- Who is it?
- Don't know.

1241
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,040
Let's have a look.

1242
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,480
She fainted.

1243
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:21,200
Must be one of those
poor women from inside.

1244
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,960
What do we do?
Take her back inside.

1245
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,480
Help me.

1246
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:30,080
It's getting late.
We must get the child back.

1247
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,000
I don't understand.

1248
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:37,920
If that woman gets back first,
there'll be terrible trouble!

1249
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:41,280
Fine. We'll take her home.
Let's go.

1250
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,600
Evening, ma'am. Recognize me?

1251
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,320
Yes, it's me.

1252
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,680
Surprised to see me, aren't you?

1253
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,880
Did you escape from prison?

1254
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,440
No, I'm a free man.
It took them five years

1255
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,880
to realize I was innocent.
Haven't you seen the papers?

1256
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,880
KILLER ARRESTED

1257
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,520
They found the real killer.

1258
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,880
But don't be afraid.
I only want to know

1259
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,120
where my wife and daughter are.

1260
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,400
I know nothing about it.

1261
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,960
I was told Anna's been
in Naples a while.

1262
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,480
What's become of her?
You must know.

1263
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,920
I want to know, no matter what.

1264
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,600
I don't know!

1265
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,960
What do you mean?

1266
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:34,800
Go away, or I'll call for help!

1267
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,040
Wait, please.

1268
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:40,680
You needn't call anyone.
Don't be afraid.

1269
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,680
But I'm sure you know.

1270
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,640
It's been five years of torment.

1271
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,960
My only thought has been
to find my wife and daughter.

1272
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,280
Even if she's forgotten me

1273
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,680
or left me for another.

1274
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:58,360
But my daughter is my flesh and blood,
and I want to find her.

1275
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,840
You think she'd be happy
to see a father like you again?

1276
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,920
What should she be ashamed of?

1277
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,920
That I spent five
hellish years in prison

1278
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,160
for a crime I didn't commit?

1279
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,360
Ninuccia, give your daddy a hug.

1280
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:27,120
- Daddy!
- My beautiful little girl!

1281
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,640
Happy that Daddy's back?

1282
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,680
My little girl!

1283
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,040
I'll never leave you again.

1284
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,000
Are you happy now?

1285
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,360
You're so big now,

1286
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,120
and so beautiful.

1287
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,720
Very well.
It's best you know everything.

1288
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:53,040
I took your daughter in
out of pity,

1289
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,240
to save her from misery

1290
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,560
and make
a decent woman out of her,

1291
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,160
with no father or mother
to be ashamed of!

1292
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,440
Why should she be
ashamed of her mother?

1293
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,960
What did Anna do?

1294
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,240
Where is she?

1295
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,000
You really want to know?

1296
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,160
I'll tell you.

1297
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,000
She's in a home
for wayward women.

1298
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,160
Wayward women?

1299
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:22,000
- What did she do?
- I don't know.

1300
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:24,040
Ask her.

1301
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:28,120
Now you see why I tried
to keep the child from her.

1302
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,320
Liar!

1303
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:35,440
Tell him the truth,
or I'll tell him myself.

1304
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,320
Your wife is a saint.

1305
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:40,320
This horrible woman
forced her into that home

1306
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,040
when the poor woman
came begging for scraps

1307
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,560
for that innocent child!

1308
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,760
- Hold your tongue!
- No! I must speak!

1309
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:52,040
Your wife went into that home
to save her daughter.

1310
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,080
That was the terrible condition
imposed on her,

1311
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,720
and she accepted it
like a martyr,

1312
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,400
and now she's pining away
in desperation!

1313
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,040
With God as my witness!

1314
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,880
Enough! Get out!

1315
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,120
Yes, now I can go.

1316
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,720
Get out!

1317
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,280
Enough!

1318
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,040
Not another word!

1319
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,120
You've caused
enough harm already!

1320
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,760
Thank God I don't want
to go back to prison,

1321
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,200
or I'd commit the crime now
I didn't commit then!

1322
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,680
But you'll pay for this,

1323
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,960
you swine!

1324
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,160
Ninuccia, come.

1325
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,960
Let's go.

1326
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,320
- You'll pay for this.
- Yes, I'll pay you back right now!

1327
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,120
Horrid witch!

1328
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:54,320
Our little rose bush
bloomed early.

1329
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,640
How wonderful!

1330
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,480
St. Rita's roses.
Today is her saint's day.

1331
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,480
The little girls in her orphanage

1332
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,440
are making
their First Communion today.

1333
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,760
I want to see Carlo
and my little girl

1334
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,080
one last time.

1335
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,600
I'm at my wits' end!

1336
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,840
No one will listen to me!

1337
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,640
I don't want to die
cursed like this!

1338
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:41,480
My daughter, who among us
hasn't suffered terribly

1339
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:45,560
and called on death
as the only liberation?

1340
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,320
Then the hour of peace comes.

1341
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:52,920
That day will come for you too,
Anna, my sister in sorrow.

1342
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:56,120
Your eyes have shed
too many tears.

1343
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,240
Hear that choir of angels?

1344
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:06,640
It's your daughter telling you,
"Mommy, don't lose faith."

1345
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,840
The day is near
when I'll be with you forever.

1346
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,880
"Forever."

1347
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,320
Call to her and say,

1348
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,040
"My little girl."

1349
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,160
Yes, my beautiful little girl.

1350
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,760
I see her.

1351
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,880
I hear her coming closer.

1352
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,880
It's her.

1353
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,040
My angel...

1354
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:43,160
your mother's waiting
with open arms!

1355
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,200
Sweetheart!

1356
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,680
Mommy, look. It's Daddy.

1357
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,840
This must be a dream.

1358
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,800
It's no dream.

1359
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,520
I'm a free man.

1360
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:22,200
They finally recognized
my innocence.

1361
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,400
Poor Anna.

1362
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:31,840
How you must have suffered!

1363
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,200
Hold me.

1364
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,000
I'm so happy.

1365
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,280
