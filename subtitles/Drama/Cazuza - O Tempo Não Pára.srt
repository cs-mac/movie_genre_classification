Ah...That joke wasn't funny

8
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:46,376
How many times should I repeat that?

9
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:47,524
You will never learn it, huh!

10
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:48,956

00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:51,977
C'mon, stop that jokes!

00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:57,469
Well... Let's use our last time in class
to met the new classmate.

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,054
Gabriel, Don't you want to introduce yourself?

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,915
I think that's no necessary

15
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:02,714
Ahh, of course it's necessary

16
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,008
Come here... Introduce yourself...

17
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,751
All mates: Gabriel! Gabriel! Gabriel! Gabriel!

00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,018
What's happened?

22
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:25,569
Ahh..The guys threw a ball

23
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:28,685
Well, time will introduce you all better. Okay?

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,414
Gabriel can go back 
to your seat.

25
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:51,858
Can we go?

26
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:01,234
Are you gonna rise or down the street?

27
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:01,946
Rise.

28
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:04,014
Do you wanna come with us?

29
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:05,177
Yeah, of course!

30
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,420
Give me the key, Leo.

31
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:26,303
You're "deliveried", bye!

32
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:29,861
- Bye Grabriel!

33
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:35,722
Well, bye to you too

34
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,184
Don't you gonna take down street?

35
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:41,405
No, I live two block behind.
I just came here to leave Leo at home

36
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:43,506
- So, see you tomorrow at school!
- Yeah

37
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:44,912
- Bye!
- Bye!

38
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:50,255
I'm telling you...
Carina was looking at you during the test.

39
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:52,049
That's why she was the last 
one to get out of the class.

40
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,883
You know I'm not interested on her.
Don't you know?

41
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:55,380
Ha... But you're not interesting
in anyone, aren't you?

42
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,222
At least. You didn't tell me.

43
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,679
I'm your best friend.
I deserve know suck a thing.

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,020
I always tell you about the 
boys I'm interested, Leo.

45
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,897
It has been some time you
don't tell me about anyone.

46
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:06,898
I mean, since Tiago you don't...

47
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:09,052
huf... you don't talk to 
 me about that idiot.

48
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:10,726
Take easy!

49
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:12,221
Can I seat down with you?

50
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:13,222
Have a seat!

51
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,223
Get up, Leo!

52
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:19,118
So, Did you already know the school?

53
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,484
Well, I figure out where is the library.

54
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:23,282
And the test, was it nice for you?

55
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:26,622
I guess so... 
But Carina didn't like it.

56
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,938
She is a absent-minded and she 
never pay attention in the classes...

57
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:30,602
And you? Did you get a good grade?

58
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,063
Ahh.. I guess so. But...

59
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:35,084
- I always liked to study math. So...
- Ah... You should teach Leo.

60
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,987
- He's really bad in maths.

61
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:40,732
- Yeah? I'd like to see you studying
 math in Braille system.

62
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,287
Hum, you nervous.

63
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,164
Ah... Anyway, that's test 
wasn't so important...

64
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:45,844
If you want it. I can help you 
studying to the next one.

65
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,264
You shouldn't refuse it, Leo.

66
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:48,932
Next week we'll have another test
Don't you wanna repeat classes 

67
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,812

Coz' you don't know how using 
a quadratic formula, huh?

68
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,271
Bla, bla, bla...
a quadratic formula, huh?

69
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:58,257
Do you prefer to step barefoot 
on an ant colony? ...

70
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:00,879
or....Do you prefer that 
a cockroach getting in your pants?

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,782
The cockroach, of course!
I just need to get the pants off...

72
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:09,210
Gabriel, How can I use 
that formula, again?

73
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:15,008
Do you prefer a mosquito 
getting in your mouth? ...

74
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,847
or... Do you prefer to lose 
your whole saves?

75
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:22,516
Look! When your are using 'X'...

76
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,439
- What did the cat say?
- Meow!

77
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,858

78
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:51,074
- Gi, How Gabriel looks like?

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,590

84
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:19,990
- Do you live around here, Gi?
- I live in that yellow house.

85
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:23,019
Ah... If you want it, 
I can leave Leo to his house

86
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,260
Ah.. I don't know.
I guess it's not necessary.

87
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:27,788
There's no problem for me, Gi...

88
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,367
- Are you sure?
- Huh-hum...

Archaic Period.

95
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:12,827
So, Folks!


96
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,935
Instead we have been 
studying about Greece.

97
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:17,835
I'll ask you to join in pairs 
to do a homework. Okay?

98
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,482
But I want pairs between 
boys or between girls

99
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:25,691
The boys will write about Sparta.
And the girls about Athens. Okay?

100
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:28,830
C'mon! Get in pairs, please!

101
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:38,896
- Can I join you?
- Yeah

102
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,527
Well, I'm going to library.
We decided to do the homework right here.

103
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,611
- Where are you planning to do it?
- At my place.

104
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:50,143
- Okay. Have a nice work!

105
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:01,499
- Have you been always like that?
- Like what?

106
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,709
- Brunet? Or blind?
- Blind

107
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:07,510
Since I was born.

108
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:09,180
Are you okay?

109
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,389
Not always.

110
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:15,442
Sometimes, I'm a bit upsetting 
about the world. You know?

111
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:18,523
- But, everyone is upsetting sometimes, 
by some reason... - Yeah!

112
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,409
I don't what I could do 
If I were blind!

113
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,392
You'd learn how deal with it.

114
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:25,385
I can tell you there're some advantages.

115
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:28,221
People makes you more favors,
for example.

116
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:36,411
So, It means you never 
saw Giovana's face.

117
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:39,962
Yeah! ... Never!

118
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,910
It's funny! 
Coz' I think she likes you

119
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,622
Of course, yes!
She is my friend.

120
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,450
No! I mean she's interested in you.

121
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:51,715
- Shut up! It's non sense!
- I don't know... the way she looks to you.

122
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:54,813
- It doesn't look like just a friendship.
- C'mon! Stop it!

123
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:01,818
And you? Don't you like her?

124
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,927
No!

125
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:06,506

126
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:11,099
Relax! I'll put it in the trash can.

127
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,812
- Did you see it?
- What?

128
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:15,554
Favors!

130
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:56,252
Okay! I'm ready now.

131
00:08:57,109 --> 00:09:00,407
- It's hot here, Leo!
- Of course! You're wearing a sweatshirt.

132
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,682
- How did you know I'm wearing it?
- Huh... How would it be?

133
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:11,355
Okay! I'm not wearing it!
No more...

134
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:14,642
Leo, I'd like to brush my teeth.
Can I use a bathroom?

135
00:09:14,643 --> 00:09:18,415
Yeah! The third door at left.

136
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,979
- The third door at left, right?
- Yeah!

137
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:53,273
[Giovana singing...]

138
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:55,744
[..."saudade"] = feeling to miss someone.

139
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:58,769
- It was 'vontade', Gi! (= desire)
- It wasn't 'saudade'?

140
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,570
Of course not!

141
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,821
Gi...

142
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:12,043
- Am I handsome?
- Hum?

143
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,005
Don't think people thinks I'm a pretty one?

144
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:20,698
Huh... I think you are...

145
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,418
Okay, but and the rest of people?

146
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,404
Well, the others I don't know, Leo!
I have to ask them about it.

147
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:28,943
- So? Can we go?
- Yeah!

148
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,738
- Are you two here?

00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:42,793
- Hurry! I'm Hungry.
- So, Let's go Gabriel!

150
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:47,431
Have you two already done 
the history homework?

151
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:49,190
No! We're gonna finished it today.

152
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,614
I see... So, bye!

153
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,761
Do you see this two dots before 
the letter, Gabriel?

154
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,513
So, It means capital letters

155
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:08,901
It's written: the tempeture of the wheater...

156
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:12,034
- Give me your hand!
- Right! Look!

157
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:20,183
The temperture of the tropical 
wheather presents... variable

158
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,175
Look! It's a hyphen.
... variable...

159
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:32,667
- Bless you!
- Thanks!

160
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:38,043
Leo, I forgot my sweatshirt
in your place

161
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:39,715
You can go there today,
after this class!

162
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:42,052
Sucks! After the class 
I'm going to the dentist's

163
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,142
I can bring it tomorrow to you.

164
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,202
Hum... Okay!

165
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:56,424
- Bless you!
- Thanks!

166
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,912
- Where's Gabriel?
- He goes to the dentist's

167
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:02,286
huhhh... Gabriel, Gabriel

168
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:05,271
- What's the matter?
- Nothing!

169
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:12,628
- Gi,... I'd like to talk to you.
- Right! Do it!

170
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:14,790
No, here's not the right place.

171
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,776
Gee! What's so important you 
can't talk to me right here?

172
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,339
I'll talk to you later

173
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,452
No. Now, you're gonna tell me. 
I'm curious.

174
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:26,395
- Is there anyone around us?
- No, everybody has already gone.

175
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:31,754
So... what's going on, Leo?

176
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,717
I think I fell in love with Gabriel

177
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:43,652
Did you hear that?

178
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:50,243
Yep, I did... I'm thinking.
I don't know what to say...

179
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,089
How about now? 
Do you know what?

180
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:57,997
What do you mean 'fell in love'?

181
00:12:57,998 --> 00:13:01,137
Huh, 'fell in love' like boyfriend!

182
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:02,597
You mean: a gay boyfriend?

183
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:04,562
I guess so, right?

184
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:09,421
Look Leo! It's my mother. 
Today is my grandmother's birthday

185
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,896
- And I've to luch in her house.
- Gi !!

186
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,625
After that I'll go to your place!
I swear I wouldn't even eat dessert. Okay?

187
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,650
Okay...

188
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:58,627
Giovana, I can't believe you left me.
After what I told you.

189
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,198
Okay, I know it's not something 
that you used to see. But, c'mon...

190
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,611
I tell you such a thing and 
you left me all alone waiting

191
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:06,840
And I'm sure you ate dessert!

192
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,017
Look! I've been here for
 hours asking myself 

193
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:12,138
If it was right, telling you 
I'm in love with Gabriel

194
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,008
You know... You're so jealous

195
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:16,996
Now, I don't wanna even see...

196
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:20,758
Giovana?

197
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,629
Ow Leo, I'm sorry. 
I swear I tried to come soon

198
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,870
But, there was lots of aunts in 
my grandmother's house

199
00:14:57,871 --> 00:14:59,828
And they were singing 
eternal "happy birthday"

200
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,271
And I though it 
wouldn't have a end...

201
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:03,490
After that, everyone was 
sitting with me in a table

202
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:04,813
And they was aking me: 
How was school?

203
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:05,940
- and and how college... -
- Gi!!

204
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:06,437
What?

205
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:08,847
Are you seeing a 
sweatshirt somewhere?

206
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,344
No!

207
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:12,963
Are you sure?
Even below the bed?

208
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,766
Neither below the bed.

209
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:20,373
Sorry Leo, I left you
all alone at school

210
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:21,750
Are you okay?

211
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:23,820
Yeah!

212
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:28,901
