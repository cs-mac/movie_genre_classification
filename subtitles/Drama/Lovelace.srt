<i>I've really got to use</i>

2
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:25,874
<i>My imagination</i>

3
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:30,312
<i>Mm, to think of
good reasons</i>

4
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,914
<i>To keep on keepin' on</i>

5
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,849
<i>Keep on keepin' on</i>

6
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:38,419
<i>- Got to make the best of.
- Best of, best of</i>

7
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:42,323
<i>- A bad situation.
- Bad situation</i>

8
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:44,258
<i>Ever since that day</i>

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,262
<i>I woke up and found
that you were gone</i>

10
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:50,531
<i>Gone, gone</i>

11
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:54,468
<i>Darkness all around me</i>

12
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,838
<i>Blackin' out the sun</i>

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,941
<i>Old friends call me</i>

14
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:05,145
<i>But I just don't feel
like talkin' to anyone</i>

15
00:01:06,247 --> 00:01:09,850
<i>Emptiness has found me</i>

16
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:13,320
And it just won't let me go

17
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:16,857
<i>Go right on livin'</i>

18
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,192
<i>But why, I just don't know</i>

19
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:21,393
Ladies and gentlemen,

20
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:23,963
the moment we've all
been waiting for,

21
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:29,201
the one, the only
Linda Lovelace!

22
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:34,406
<i>- What's your name?
- Linda Lovelace.</i>

23
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:36,342
<i>I meant what's your real name?</i>

24
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,310
<i>- That's my real name.
- So, what did you do</i>

25
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:40,479
<i>before you were the first ever
pornographic film superstar?</i>

26
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:42,882
<i>How does it feel to
be the poster girl</i>

27
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:44,183
<i>for the sexual revolution?</i>

28
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,917
<i>The pornographic
film Deep Throat</i>

29
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,919
<i>has become one of
the most popular</i>

30
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,021
<i>and profitable Blue
movies of all time.</i>

31
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:53,157
<i>Today a Manhattan criminal court
judge ruled the film obscene</i>

32
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,593
<i>and ordered it removed from
theaters in New York City.</i>

33
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:58,463
<i>This is kind of a strange country, isn't it?
Judges can see Deep Throat,</i>

34
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:00,965
<i>- but they can't listen to those tapes.
- Deep Throat,</i>

35
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:04,068
<i>a trendsetting film that brought
pornography into popular culture.</i>

36
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,671
<i>How did you become Linda
Lovelace in the first place,</i>

37
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:08,439
<i>if you were born
as Linda Boreman?</i>

38
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:10,208
<i>I think you can be a star,</i>

39
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,175
<i>and I don't mean just
an adult-movie star.</i>

40
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:14,678
<i>I mean a real star.</i>

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,613
<i>Is your name Linda Lovelace?</i>

42
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:18,649
<i>So tell me,</i>

43
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:22,419
<i>who's the real Linda Lovelace?</i>

44
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:25,255
<i>Just give me some
kind of sign, girl</i>

45
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:30,410
<i>Oh, my baby, to show me that
you're mine, girl, oh, yeah</i>

46
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:33,697
<i>Just give me some
kind of sign, girl</i>

47
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,234
<i>Oh, my darlin', to show
me that you're mine, girl</i>

48
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:42,071
<i>All right so if
you do want me</i>

49
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:45,942
<i>Give me little sweet talk
If you don't want me</i>

50
00:02:45,944 --> 00:02:48,678
<i>Don't lead me on, girl</i>

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,682
<i>But if you need me Show
me that you love me</i>

52
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:55,084
<i>And when I'm feeling down</i>

53
00:02:55,086 --> 00:03:00,222
- No! Patsy! Come on.
- Jeez! Come on, Miss Holy Holy.

54
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,724
- You want to get tan lines?
- Mm.

55
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,559
You're gonna thank me later.

56
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:07,395
So have you slept
with that guy yet?

57
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:11,199
- No. Patsy, come on.
- Don't be such a prude.

58
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,701
- You're 21 years old.
- Prude?

59
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:14,569
How am I a prude?
I think I've learned

60
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,271
my lesson that one time,
thank you very much.

61
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:19,240
There are other things
that you can do.

62
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:22,577
Ugh. I don't even know how
to talk to you anymore.

63
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,080
Seriously, that's disgusting.

64
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:28,215
That's disgusting.

65
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:31,518
- Linda!
- Shit, is that your Mom?

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,053
I thought you said
she was work.

67
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:34,254
- Linda.
- Take this, please.

68
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,589
- Yeah.
- Put it out.

69
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,592
Linda, are you out back?

70
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:42,196
Honestly, what is this,
a nudist colony?

71
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:45,499
- What are you wearing?
- Ma!

72
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:48,002
Get in the house.

73
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,374
<i>I'm gonna be out all night</i>

74
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:57,610
<i>I'm gonna be out all night</i>

75
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,747
Okay? 'Cause everybody's
going fast.

76
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,315
- Ready?
- Ready.

77
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:05,418
- Careful.
- All I can see is your butt.

78
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,022
Oh, my God!

79
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:13,326
Cool band. They're missing
something, though,

80
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,428
- don't you think?
- Like what?

81
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,731
- Go-go dancers.
- You volunteering?

82
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:31,309
<i>Never met a girl
who makes me feel</i>

83
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:33,078
<i>- Come on, babe.
- The way that you do</i>

84
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,213
<i>- Move your hips!
- You're all right</i>

85
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:38,383
<i>Whenever I'm asked what
makes my dreams real</i>

86
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:41,652
<i>- I tell 'em you do.
- Feel it!</i>

87
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:45,456
<i>So fee fi fo fum</i>

88
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,827
<i>Look out, baby
'Cause here I come</i>

89
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:52,129
<i>Now I'm bringing you
a love that's true</i>

90
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:55,599
<i>So get ready Get ready</i>

91
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,302
<i>- 'Cause here I come.

92
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:01,705
<i>'Cause here I come</i>

93
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,476
- Actually, like...
- Do that again.

94
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,378
- I know.
- You enjoyed it.

95
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,180
I need, like, a week off.

96
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:13,450
- You two move pretty good up there.
- Thanks.

97
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:15,819
You ever think about doing
that professionally?

98
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:18,621
Yeah, right.

99
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:23,393
Yeah! Dancing girls in Vegas, they
make two or 300 bucks a night.

100
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:27,130
What? Ha. Someone would pay
that much to see me dance?

101
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:27,676
I would.

102
00:05:31,635 --> 00:05:33,402
I'm Chuck Traynor, by the way.

103
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:35,471
- I'm Patsy.
- Linda.

104
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:38,407
- You guys smoke grass?
- Yeah, sure.

105
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,676
Patsy, I have to go home now.

106
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:42,845
It's a little bit of grass.
Come on, babe.

107
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:44,213
Okay.

108
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:55,157
I'm good.

00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,139
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. See you later.
I'm going.

115
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:13,641
Linda!

116
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,844
Where do you think you're going?

117
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:19,347
The beach.

118
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:20,881
It's dark.

119
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:24,551
And what on Earth
do you have on?

120
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:28,155
- It's a party.
- And whose party is it?

121
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:30,857
Uh, I'm going with Patsy and her boyfriend Ray.
It's a friend of his.

122
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:35,362
- And what does this Ray do?
- I don't know, Ma.

123
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:38,498
It's not like I made him
fill out a questionnaire.

124
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,734
Mm-mm.

125
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:46,472
I think Patsy said he was
a bartender, all right?

126
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:49,675
But I did tell them that I had
to be home by 11:00 on the nose.

127
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:55,281
Any later, and I'll
call you, swear to God.

128
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,453
See you, sweetheart.

129

You know that one?

133
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,434
- The one with that guy?
- Exactly.

134
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,637
My God, I was so stoned
when I saw that.

135
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,873
I couldn't figure out
what was going on.

136
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,641
I kept expecting there
to be subtitles.

137
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,543
- Yeah, there weren't.
- No, I know.

138
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,878
They were speaking American.

139
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,346
No, but by the time
I figured that out,

140
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,415
it was, like, halfway
through the movie.

141
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,550
Hey, guys. Let's
go skinny-dipping.

142
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:36,220
No! I gotta go, so...

143
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,588
- What?
- Yeah.

144
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,757
You're such a drag.

145
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,261
We're gonna go. Wooh!

146
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,662
Come on. I'm going in!

147
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:47,598
Jump in!

148
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,434
- You don't dig the ocean?
- No.

149

I don't know.

150
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:03,346
- Ow.
- What?

151
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,715
- You bit me.
- I did?

152
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:08,251
- Yeah.
- No, I didn't.

153
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:10,953
It's cool.

154
00:08:12,356 --> 00:08:14,390
You don't think I'm a drag?

155
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:15,858
Well, I don't think
you're a drag at all.

156
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,262
- No?
- No way.

157
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:32,874
Thanks for the ride home.

158
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:34,743
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Come on!

159
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:37,479
Come on!

160
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:40,448
You haven't said a word
since we got in the car.

161
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,751
You can tell me.

162
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:44,819
What is it? What's going on?

163
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,058
Okay.

164
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:59,066
- I got pregnant.
- Mm.

165
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:00,868
And I had a baby last year,

166
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,837
and that's why we moved
here from Yonkers.

167
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,640
Where's this... Where's
this baby now?

168
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,876
I don't even know.

169
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:11,945
My mom put him
up for adoption.

170
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:14,648
She told me I was signing
circumcision papers.

171
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:19,652
- Damn.
- Yeah.

172
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:23,956
I'd like to meet your folks.

173
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:27,427
- Really?
- I think they'd dig me.

174
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:30,496
No, they don't dig anybody.

175
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:32,332
They don't even dig themselves.

176
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:33,933
Listen, I'll make you a bet.

177
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:35,001
You have me over for dinner,

178
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:36,969
and by the end of the night,

179
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:41,707
if they say, "What a
lovely young man,"

180
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,609
- then I win.
- What do you win?

181
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:47,813
You spend the night at my house.

182
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:50,849
And if they don't,
what do I win?

183
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:54,019
You spend the night
at my house.

184
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:02,694
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:06,731
Okay. Right there.

186
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,752
Lord, make us
thankful for these

187
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,920
and all our many blessings.
Amen.

188
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,955
- Amen.
- Amen.

189
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:34,557
Chuck, I'd like to
thank you again

190
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,594
- for those lovely flowers.
- My pleasure.

191
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,729
Linda tells us that you
were in the service.

192
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:41,131
Yes, ma'am, Marine Corps.

193
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,099
Mr. Boreman was
in World War II.

194
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,035
Oh, yeah? You in the Corps?

195
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:50,640
- No, Army. Italy, mostly.
- I was stationed in Korea.

196
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:53,042
I won a couple of
marksmanship competitions,

197
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:55,511
but that's about all
the action I ever saw.

198
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,112
I bet you would have
been brave, though.

199
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,181
The guys that served
with your father,

200
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:02,718
they're some of the bravest
men that I ever met.

201
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:07,055
So, what do you do now?

202
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:10,125
- I own a bar and restaurant.
- That's interesting.

203
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,027
What kind of bar
and restaurant?

204
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,496
Just good food and
pretty waitresses.

205
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:16,832
What do you do for
work, Mr. Boreman?

206
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:19,768
I was a cop in New York
before we moved to Florida.

207
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,736
Now I do security
at the airport.

208
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,539
Mr. Boreman has a
million stories, Chuck.

209
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,641
Is that right?

210
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:29,043
<i>Johnny, you better go in the
kitchen and warm his milk.</i>

211
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:31,012
<i>Milk. Okay.</i>

212
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:34,215
Mugs are above the sink, Linda.

213
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:36,083
- Jesus.
- Forget about them.

214
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,486
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

215
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:46,593
Where are you? Where
are you right now?

216
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,829
- I'm with you.
- Yeah.

217
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:51,531
Yeah, that's my girl.

218
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,869
You're my girl, hmm? Right?

219
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:58,505
Yeah.

220
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:07,914
<i>They don't eat with
their hands, you dope.</i>

221
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:14,687
- Say it.
- I... I'm...

222
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:17,523
I'm your girl.

223
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:19,992
How's it coming
out there, Linda?

224
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:23,829
Uh, almost there, Ma!

225
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:27,967
What time's the movie get out?

226
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:31,003
- I told you, 10:30.
- Be home at 11:00.

227
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,739
I know.

228
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:37,175
Seems like a nice young man.

229
00:12:48,587 --> 00:12:52,223
Oh, right. Um...

230
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:57,568
Hey!

231
00:12:58,703 --> 00:12:59,859
Hey!

232
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,534
Just cut it out.

233
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:05,068
What are you so uptight about?

234
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,737
- My scar. It's gross.
- Come on. Foxy girl like you

235
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:08,572
should love to
show off her body.

236
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:10,841
Come on. Come on. Let me see.

237
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:12,876
Come on. Let me see it.

238
00:13:12,878 --> 00:13:16,046
- It's gross.
- Please?

239
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:23,587
This is it? This little thing?

240
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,223
Ah.

241
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:30,126
It's ugly. I hate it.

242
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:34,830
Why? 'Cause it's different?
'Cause it's not perfect?

243
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:40,336
All those uptight
idiots in the suburbs.

244
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,072
All those cookie-cutter robots

245
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:45,308
that your mama goes
to church with.

246
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,777
I fooled around and fell...

247
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,178
Screw 'em.

248
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:54,049
Screw 'em.

249
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:57,886
'Cause this and you,

250
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:00,789
mm, are beautiful.

251
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,625
<i>A girl that I liked</i>

252
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:06,628
<i>- I'd get out my book...
- Hey. I love your freckles.</i>

253
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,251
You're late.

254
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:57,176
Come on, baby.

255
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:10,188
Yeah!

256
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,025
<i>Wooh Baby</i>

257
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:15,994
<i>Lord, Lord, Lord...</i>

258
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:19,931
To... Keep going. Keep going.
Boom.

259
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,400
And here we go.

260
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,835
You put a lot of
Margarita mix in there.

261
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:26,438
Uh, yeah. Okay.

262
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:30,875
<i>To keep a flower growing</i>

263
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:32,443
Margarita?

264
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:35,680
- Thanks.
- Hey.

265
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:37,448
Hey.

266
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,917
Mmm.

267
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,021
- You like porno?
- I like some.

268
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,424
You like 'em.

269
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:47,792
- No.
- I can tell.

270
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:49,060
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

271
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:50,394
- Yeah.
- I don't actually.

272
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,763
Trust me.

273
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,998
- I love your XXX.
- What are you doing?

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,934
- Hey!
- But Linda won't mind. She's cool.

275
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,370
Okay?

276
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:07,010
I wouldn't go in
there if I were you.

277
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:11,247
<i>Oh, baby</i>

278
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:15,151
<i>We're making love

279

- Oh, my God.
- Home movie.

280
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:22,791
My parents took one of me once,
but it didn't look like this.

281
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:25,828
I bet.

282
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,863
I've never seen
a porno before.

283
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:29,231
Is it turning you on?

284
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,499
Good girls don't
do that stuff.

285
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:32,868
Oh, 'cause you're a good girl?

286
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,804
I can tell you're
such a good girl.

287
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:38,307
That's what I love about you.
You're such a good girl.

288
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,125
Come on.

289
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,894
I don't want to.

290
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:03,798
You know, maybe that's 'cause
you're not any good at it.

291
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,834
- Come on. You're gonna love it.
- Really?

292
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:10,270
- Yeah. I'm gonna like it?
- Choking myself?

293
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:13,840
I could teach you. Remember how
I got you to quit smoking?

294
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:15,542
Yeah. You gonna hypnotize me?

295
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:19,045
It's the same mind-body
control technique.

296
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,516
Yeah?

297
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:28,054
Out of sight. Ah!

298
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:33,560
Hey, your mind has control.

299
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:35,828
Come on. A little more.
There you go.

300
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,531
Take it in. That's right.

301
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:42,334
Don't forget to breathe.
Come here.

302
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,275
Don't forget to breathe, Okay?

303
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,515
You got it. Okay? Go.

304
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,252
Oh, yeah.

<i>Gotta have a
friend in Jesus</i>

317
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:10,653
<i>So you know that
when you die...</i>

318
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:14,056
Congratulations,
Mrs. Chuck Traynor.

319
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:17,492
I've never done it with
a married man before.

320
00:19:17,494 --> 00:19:19,928
- Me neither.
- Good.

321
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,197
<i>That's where you're
gonna go when you die</i>

322
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:24,165
<i>When you die</i>

323
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,101
<i>When they die and
they lay you to rest</i>

324
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:29,905
<i>You're gonna go to the
place that's the best</i>

325
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:48,989
<i>- Hello.
- Hi. It's me.</i>

326
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:50,658
Where are you? I've been
really worried about you.

327
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,393
<i>Get some money,
and come get me.</i>

328
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,528
<i>- I'm in jail.
- Ha-ha. Very funny.</i>

329
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,232
Here you go, ma'am.

330
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:02,603
Oh! Okay.

331
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:07,373
What happened, Chuck?

332
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,276
What did I say?

333
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:16,649
But this is different.

334
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:25,158
Wooh!

335
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,069
You said never ask
about your work.

336
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:39,271
That's right.

337
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:54,086
Some girls were turning
tricks out back.

338
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,288
What do you mean by...
Prostitution?

339
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,025
Yeah. Linda, it's a titty bar.

340
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:05,696
What do you think these girls live off?
Minimum wage?

341
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,165
Wait. The cops gonna
come ask me questions?

342
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,601
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, baby.

343
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,704
Wives can't testify
against husbands.

344
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:15,567
Hey.

345
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,731
Look, all I need is money.

346
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:24,047
Look, after paying your
bail, I have, um, $32, $33.

347
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,416
Linda, real money.

348
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,486
It's the IRS and the Miami PD,

349
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,522
and it's all just
that shakedown.

350
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,525
- Do you have enough?
- "We."

351
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:41,498
Baby, do we have enough, right?

352
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,466
- No, we don't.
- Mm-mm.

353
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,769
- Not yet.
- So, what are we gonna do?

354
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,218
Mary had a little lamb, whose
fleece was white as snow,

355
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,189
and everywhere
that Mary went...

356
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:10,425
...the lamb was sure to go.

357
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,331
Yeah, right?

358
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,334
That... That was great.

359
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:24,806
- Did I tell you, or what, right?
- You did. You told us.

360
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:31,145
Sweetheart, there's a
little diner on the corner.

361
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:35,816
Why don't you run down, grab
us four coffees, regular?

362
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,185
- Okay.
- All right?

363
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:40,253
- On the corner?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:44,324
- Thanks a lot, darling.
- Beautiful work.

365
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:46,493
Jesus fucking Christ, Chuck.
What the fuck was that?

366
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:49,162
Does she even know what
she was auditioning for?

367
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:53,333
I know. I know. She's new at this professionally.
I could show you this thing.

368
00:22:53,335 --> 00:22:55,402
Well, Chuck, she's really cute.
She's adorable.

369
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:58,638
She's like a sexy Raggedy
Ann or something.

370
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,874
- Cute freckles.
- Really dug her freckles. It was very...

371
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:05,244
But, you know, for this industry, I don't...
I don't know.

372
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:07,146
You don't know what, Jerry?

373
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:10,382
Go ahead. Be honest.

374
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:11,851
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

375
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:14,653
No, look, the point is, we
traffic in fantasy here.

376
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:18,591
Yeah, she's very real, the kind of
girl you sit next to her in class.

377
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,626
You see her out on the street,
you want to ball her.

378
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:23,496
But, you know, you've seen the girls
that come in and do this now.

379
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:25,263
I mean, they've all
been to the surgeon.

380
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:26,664
I mean, you can't light
your cigarette around 'em.

381
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,866
You're afraid their
tits are gonna go up

382
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,200
like the Hindenburg
or something.

383
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:30,335
Linda has tits.

384
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:31,870
She does. Nice ones, too.

385
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:33,838
Not the point.

386
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,807
It's not like the old days, you
know, where you just point a camera

387
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:37,575
at two people screwing,
and you call it art.

388
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:39,410
I mean, the audiences
expect a lot more.

389
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:43,181
She's beautiful, but,
you know, more pizzazz.

390
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:45,283
- We need more pizzazz.
- No offense.

391
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:47,252
I'm gonna show you what
Jerry's talking about.

392
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:49,220
- No, I...
- Nicky, come here for a sec.

393
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:51,221
I want to show you this... I want
to show you this movie we made.

394
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:55,826
Now, this is the
prototype, right?

395
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:59,496
People want blonde
hair, huge tits,

396
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:01,498
and a nice, beautiful
round ass.

397
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,634
It's the harsh reality of
our chosen profession.

398
00:24:03,636 --> 00:24:05,769
- Dynamite work, Nicky.
- Thanks, Butch.

399
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:07,304
I'm gonna show you this.

400
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:10,474
Chuck, we are
making a movie here

401
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:13,777
on 35 millimeter. Jerry
even wrote a script.

402
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:16,779
- 42 pages. You hear that?
- 42 fucking pages.

403
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:18,481
This thing is gonna
be in theaters,

404
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:20,650
and, look, people
want what they want.

405
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:21,951
Chuck, your girl,

406
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,920
she's cute, she's skinny.
She's got no hips.

407
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:27,390
It's like making a war movie
without the fighting.

408
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,891
Tits and ass,
that's the action.

409
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:32,595
Chuck, I don't want to bum you out.
Can she type?

410
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,830
Maybe I could find some
work for her in the office.

411
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:36,599
Look at this! Look at the...

412
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,967
I don't care about this.
Listen to me.

413
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:39,801
I know she doesn't have it.
Chuck.

414
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:41,770
- Look at that!
- We just saw what she could do.

415
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,338
- She acted? Couldn't act.
- Look what she can do.

416
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,873
- Look! See?
- Whoa, Butchie.

417
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,608
But... Are you...
Did you see this?

418
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,946
Look at this. Look at this.
Are you seeing this?

419
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:55,617
- Holy shit.
- Oh!

420
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:59,421
Wait. Is that real?

421
00:24:59,423 --> 00:25:00,655
Is she actually doing that?

422
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:02,290
Yeah, right.

423
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,458
Ho ho! Oh, my God!

424
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,694
Yeah, can she do that
with a big cock?

425
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:09,263
- No offense.
- She can do that with anything.

426
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:11,999
Ah, that's far out. That is...
You see that?

427
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,802
That is art, baby. That's art.

428
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,478
<i>If you ain't
getting your thing</i>

429
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,714
<i>Like you ought to be
getting your thing</i>

430
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:30,617
<i>Somebody else be getting
your thing for you</i>

431
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:33,620
<i>Better listen what I'm
saying now, fellas</i>

432
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:35,822
<i>If you ain't
getting your thing</i>

433
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:37,924
<i>Like you ought to be
getting your thing</i>

434
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:40,526
<i>Somebody else be getting
your thing for you</i>

435
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:42,528
- Anybody want a hit?
- Jerry?

436
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,964
- Yeah?
- Not a cloud in the sky.

437
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:46,332
What's with all the
fucking lights?

438
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,900
Shadows, Butchie, shadows.

439
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:50,503
Your shadows are costing
me hundreds of dollars.

440
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,605
You want to turn the lights off?
You want it to look like shit?

441
00:25:52,607 --> 00:25:54,373
No problem. I'll
turn 'em all off.

442
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:58,410
Fucking artist, huh?

443
00:25:58,412 --> 00:26:02,281
- Bad toupee.
- Wants to make a movie without lights.

444
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:05,917
How long have you
been a makeup person?

445
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,819
Oh, I'm not a professional.

446
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:10,622
I mean, not in makeup, anyway.

447
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:13,525
You know, when you get to
be my age in this business,

448
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:16,428
it helps to have as
many skills as you can.

449
00:26:17,597 --> 00:26:19,463
I don't have any skills.

450
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:21,832
That's not what I heard.

451
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,834
There she is. Here's
our star, huh?

452
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:25,536
What'd I tell you?
The girl next door.

453
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:28,339
Linda, this is our
financier, Anthony Romano.

454
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:30,508
It's very nice to meet you.

455
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,710
Sweetheart, let me
tell you something.

456
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:34,845
If what these guys
are saying is true,

457
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:37,782
this is gonna be the best
investment of my life.

458
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:42,753
I can't wait to see your work.

459
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:45,588
Yeah. Oh, and this is Dolly.

460
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,825
- This is Linda's costar and makeup artist.
- A pleasure.

461
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:51,695
- I have many skills.
- Yeah? Do you?

462
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:54,631
Let's let the stars get
back to work, huh?

463
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:57,400
All right. We'll
see you later.

464
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:03,473
Easy there, sister. Don't
cover her freckles.

465
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:05,809
Okay.

466
00:27:06,911 --> 00:27:09,345
Hey. What are you doing?

467
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:10,446
Her freckles are her thing.

468
00:27:10,448 --> 00:27:11,613
- All right?
- Okay.

469
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:13,949
Be cool.

470
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:18,754
You look good.

471
00:27:18,756 --> 00:27:20,956
All right. Just not
too much, Okay?

472
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:23,459
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

473
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:30,432
Wow, he's pretty intense.

474
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:34,769
I used to have an old
man like that once.

475
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:38,406
You know, I should probably...

476
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,775
...do something about those.

477
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:46,881
Mr. Damiano will be really pissed
if I just leave 'em like that.

478
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:51,953
- I'm so clumsy.
- I know, sweetie.

479
00:27:51,955 --> 00:27:55,490
We all are.

480
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:59,060
There's just got to be more
to life than screwing around.

481
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:01,895
Than screwing around.

482
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:06,166
Sex, I don't enjoy it.

483
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:09,569
Sex, I don't enjoy it.

484
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:12,406
Linda? Harry.

485
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:16,176
We're getting it on
in the next scene.

486
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:19,079
Oh, hey. It's
nice to meet you.

487
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,781
I thought your name was Dick.

488
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,816
My stage name used
to be Dick Long,

489
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:25,451
but it sounded kind of
obvious, so you know...

490
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,953
Yeah. I agree.

491
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:30,956
This is a great
business, isn't it?

492
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,892
Anyway, I just
thought I'd come by

493
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:35,094
and introduce myself before
we started going at it.

494
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:37,797
You Okay?

495
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,666
I'm a little nervous.

496
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,768
I've never had lines
to talk before.

497
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:48,941
We got the best
job in the world.

498
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:51,443
We just tune everybody
out, live in the moment,

499
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:53,912
like we're the only two
people on the planet.

500
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:58,116
Tune everybody out.

501
00:28:58,118 --> 00:29:00,518
- Live in the moment.
- Exactly.

502
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,887
You're gonna do great.

503
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:06,891
And I cannot wait
to get it on.

504
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:12,063
Action!

505
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:20,070
- Whoa. Whoa. You all right?
- Yeah.

506
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:23,040
You Okay? Yeah?

507
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:24,541
You're just gonna
drive normally.

508
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:26,009
You know what we're
doing, right?

509
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:27,811
- Mm-hmm. Right.
- Okay.

510
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:29,947
It's just I don't know
how I normally drive.

511
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:32,583
- You...
- I just drive, you know.

512
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:34,718
Yeah, that's exactly right.
Just drive,

513
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,121
and pretend we're not here, Okay?
Whatever you'd normally do.

514
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:40,990
All right, we rolling?
Let's roll.

515
00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:56,839
Doing beautiful,
baby, beautiful!

516
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:05,881
All right, sound, speed.

517
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:11,186
And action.

518
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:13,722
It's not that I'm
turned off to sex.

519
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,690
I enjoy it. In fact,

520
00:30:15,692 --> 00:30:17,959
I could spend the rest
of my life getting laid.

521
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:19,928
Then what seems to
be the problem?

522
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,031
Well, I don't know.
Something's different.

523
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:25,901
I mean, there's just
got to be more to it

524
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:29,136
- than just a lot of little tingles.
- Little tingles?

525
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:32,072
- I want to hear bells ringing.
- Bells?

526
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:35,042
- Dams bursting!
- Dams bursting?

527
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:37,645
- Bombs going off!
- Bombs going off!

528
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:41,215
- Something.
- Nurse, Mrs. Lovelace is done with her bubbles.

529
00:30:41,217 --> 00:30:45,185
- Thank you, Dr. Young.
- Open your mouth for me.

530
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:47,121
Wider. Ah.

531
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:48,889
- Ahh...
- Ah, ah, ah.

532
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:51,659
- Ah? Ah? Ah?
- Ah.

533
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:54,627
Well, there it is!

534
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:56,663
There it is, you
little bugger!

535
00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:58,565
- What?
- Your clitoris.

536
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,133
It's down in the
bottom of your throat.

537
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:06,139
Oh now, now, Mrs. Lovelace.

538
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:08,708
There, there. Listen. It's
better to have a clitoris

539
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,947
deep down in the bottom of your throat
than to have no clitoris at all.

540
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:16,883
That's easy for you to say.

541
00:31:16,885 --> 00:31:19,117
Suppose your balls
were in your ears.

542
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,121
Well, then, I could
hear myself coming.

543
00:31:23,123 --> 00:31:26,091
And cut!

544
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,993
That was great.
That was great!

545
00:31:27,995 --> 00:31:30,596
- That was fantastic, really.
- We good? Yeah.

546
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,297
Great work, everybody.
That's a wrap.

547
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:35,934
2 days down. 5 to go.
Nice work.

548
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,869
You see?

549
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:45,042
You see that? That's
gonna be a problem.

550
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,981
- I need you to do me a favor, Chuck.
- What's that?

551
00:31:49,983 --> 00:31:53,050
I need you to go to Miami,
pick up some film tomorrow.

552
00:31:53,052 --> 00:31:55,720
Tomorrow? Tomorrow? Why?

553
00:31:55,722 --> 00:31:57,088
- Why?
- Yeah.

554
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,123
Because the stores
are all closed,

555
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,892
and if we run out of film
tomorrow, we're screwed.

556
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:05,029
But tomorrow's Linda's big day.
She needs me.

557
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:08,699
- Send somebody else.
- Okay.

558
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,367
How about I send
Linda for the film,

559
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:12,035
and you can spend tomorrow
with Harry's cock

560
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:15,839
- down your throat?
- Man.

561
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,944
You got no movie without
my girl, right?

562
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:23,113
- You know that, right, Butchie?
- Yeah.

563
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:26,716
And we ain't got no movie
without no film neither.

564
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:30,387
Yeah.

565
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:55,444
<i>All right, this is it, everybody.
Here we go. Places!</i>

566
00:32:57,113 --> 00:33:01,382
Camera! And action!

567
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,951
You can try it on me.

568
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:06,788
You'll like it.

569
00:33:08,757 --> 00:33:11,859
Well, what do I have to lose?

570
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,850
Not bad. We're all
gonna win Oscars.

571
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,861
Cut. Cut. Cut. Whoa! Harry?

572
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:50,062
- Mm!
- What's the matter?

573
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:53,466
What's happening?
What'd you...

574
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:57,002
- I don't... I'm... I...
- He came.

575
00:33:57,004 --> 00:34:02,308
- Yeah. He what? He came?
- You came? Get outta here.

576
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,376
What is this,
your Junior prom?

577
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:06,512
I know. I didn't...
I just wasn't...

578
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:08,981
- Just give me 3 minutes.
- I can go again. I'm really sorry.

579
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:13,119
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

580
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:21,926
- Wooh-hoo!
- No, thanks.

581
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:25,196
Hey! Hey, this is silk!

582
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:29,000
- Oyster?
- Thank you.

583
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:30,769
- Thanks.
- How you doing?

584
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:33,271
Hey, oyster man! Yeah, come here.
We gotta talk.

585
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:37,342
- Oyster, sir?
- Best oysters in Miami. Come here, baby.

586
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:40,778
You know, these are natural
aphrodisiacs, honey.

587
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,980
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they make you horny.

588
00:34:42,982 --> 00:34:45,949
I'm always horny.

589
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,118
Marry me.

590
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,992
No girl for you?
I can fix that.

591
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:58,495
- No, thanks, Charlie.
- Hey, Linda.

592
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:01,231
Why don't you come sit
on Mr. Romano's lap?

593
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,233
I'm having an interesting
conversation, Chuck.

594
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,802
Why don't you sit on his lap?

595
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:09,238
All right, come on.

596
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,274
Party's moving up to my room.
Where you going?

597
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:15,344
- Up to my room. Come on.
- We're going upstairs anyway.

598
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,949
<i>Help me, help me</i>

599
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,252
<i>Let me hold it, baby</i>

600
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:26,589
Hey, quiet.

601
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,990
Quiet. Quiet.

602
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:36,064
Oh, my God, that...
that's unbelievable.

603
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:39,601
- Who's in the next room?
- That's Linda and Chuck.

604
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:44,272
Girl should be in the
fucking Olympics.

605
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,288
I'm a little nervous.

606
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:08,095
Let's try this. Forget I'm even here.
Forget about all this stuff.

607
00:36:08,097 --> 00:36:09,630
Just be yourself.

608
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:18,005
Okay, um, I don't think
for the movie poster,

609
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:22,909
we can be so anatomical.

610
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:27,235
Just don't want to disappoint
anybody... I guess.

611
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:31,017
Tell me about the
role you're playing.

612
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:36,556
A girl whose clit...

613
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:39,959
- I know all that.
- Okay.

614
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:44,296
Um, tell me about the
person you're playing.

615
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:48,433
Well, at first,

616
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:52,504
I'm closed up like a flower...

617
00:36:52,506 --> 00:36:55,407
- Mm-hmm. Yeah?
- ... bud.

618
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:57,643
And, um...

619
00:36:59,979 --> 00:37:02,114
And then, gradually,

620
00:37:02,116 --> 00:37:06,118
the petals start to... to open,

621
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,586
and... and then...

622
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:12,590
...I finally learn about myself,

623
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:17,094
and I learn how to...

624
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:20,131
- ...to enjoy sex.
- Beautiful.

625
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:23,434
Then I feel free.

626
00:37:47,158 --> 00:37:49,459
Don't worry. They're
just Polaroid shots.

627
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:53,496
Oh, I know. It's not that.
It's just...

628
00:37:53,498 --> 00:37:57,400
You made me beautiful.

629
00:37:57,402 --> 00:38:02,137
All right, all right, all right.
Hey, what's the matter?

630
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:04,073
Your girl is gonna be a star.

631
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:07,209
Yeah, great, but who
the hell's Lovelace?

632
00:38:07,211 --> 00:38:09,378
It's a dynamite name.
You got to admit that.

633
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,714
What about my name?
Linda and I are a team.

634
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:14,750
- What's wrong with Traynor?
- Nothing. Chuck Traynor.

635
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:17,686
- Good name for a producer.
- So I'm a producer now? That's funny.

636
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:20,022
I thought I was a
production assistant.

637
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:21,988
A girl like Linda,

638
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:26,567
you want to see her name in lights.
Like "Linda Lovelace."

639
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:29,397
That's gotta go up on
a billboard, right?

640
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:34,702
"Lovely lace, Lovelace."

641
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:39,073
- You're gonna be filthy rich.
- Me? No. You're gonna make a fortune.

642
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:41,242
- Ah. Come on, Charlie.
- You don't think

643
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:43,578
the investors deserve to
make a little bit of money?

644
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,179
That's not what I'm saying.

645
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:47,448
And, you know, my
name isn't Charlie.

646
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,249
- Chuck.
- You got it.

647
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:51,351
Your girl's gonna be a star.

648
00:38:51,353 --> 00:38:55,355
That's the value, man, and
you, you own the product.

649
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:01,061
- Two consenting adults.
- $6.00.

650
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:03,430
- Is it all guys in there?
- What do you care?

651
00:39:03,432 --> 00:39:05,332
<i>Keep on truckin', baby</i>

652
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,567
<i>Will you pass me a
cigarette, hon?</i>

653
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:11,238
<i>Do you mind if I
smoke while you eat?</i>

654
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,740
Hey, did you hear
about Goldstein?

655
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:17,710
His magazine gave us 100
percent on the Peter meter.

656
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:20,112
Looks like we got a
full-blown big-titted hit!

657
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:22,615
What's the Peter meter?

658
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:24,350
Did they say anything about
how the film was shot?

659
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:26,385
Who gives a fuck, Jerry?
A hit's a hit.

660
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:29,555
<i>Well, then, I could
hear myself coming.</i>

661
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:34,760
<i>This is Chief Rocker
Frankie Crocker,</i>

662
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:38,630
on WNYJ Radio, New York City.
We're back with the star

663
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:42,200
<i>of the scintillating skin flick,
Deep Throat, Linda Lovelace,</i>

664
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:44,502
and the film director,
Jerry Damiano.

665
00:39:44,504 --> 00:39:46,671
- Hi.
- Hello. Hello, New York.

666
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,807
Now, Jerry, you were saying
earlier how you as an artist

667
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:50,842
were able to Transcend
the pornographic medium.

668
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:53,445
Yeah. Well, you know, it
wasn't that difficult to do.

669
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:56,347
I mean, it was... The industry was
getting pretty stale, you know.

670
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:59,451
Everything was just screwing, screwing,
screwing, and then cut to a money shot.

671
00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:01,453
You know, how many times you
supposed to look at that?

672
00:40:01,455 --> 00:40:03,354
This film is becoming
bigger than that, right?

673
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:05,756
I mean, this is a phenomenon.

674
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:09,726
<i>Baby, that's bad</i>

675
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:13,630
<i>So hard to bear, yeah...</i>

676
00:40:16,602 --> 00:40:19,703
<i>I went to see Deep Throat 'cause
I'm fond of animal pictures.</i>

677
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:21,705
<i>I thought it was
about giraffes.</i>

678
00:40:21,707 --> 00:40:24,708
<i>Feel like I'm on fire</i>

679
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,611
<i>And I'll keep on
trucking, baby</i>

680
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:30,546
Linda, right here. Big
smile, Miss Lovelace.

681
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:33,749
<i>I gotta keep on truckin'</i>

682
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:38,488
<i>I got to get your
sweet lovin'</i>

683
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:41,757
<i>How does it feel to be</i>

684
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:43,726
<i>the poster girl for the
sexual revolution?</i>

685
00:40:43,728 --> 00:40:45,394
<i>It's just a goof.</i>

686
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:47,363
To me, it's... it's a movie,

687
00:40:47,365 --> 00:40:49,232
like any other movie,

688
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:50,867
only it has so many
better things in it.

689
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:53,768
- Like what?
- Like me.

690
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,538
<i>Now now</i>

691
00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:01,243
<i>Keep on truckin'</i>

692
00:41:01,245 --> 00:41:03,845
<i>Yes, I got...</i>

693
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:06,681
Now, Linda, I mean, what do you want
to do with the future here, baby?

694
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:10,452
I hope to make
movies, real movies,

695
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:14,156
<i>and maybe do a play.</i>

696
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:17,325
I want to be an
actress, you know.

697
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:20,728
<i>The Mississippi River.</i>

698
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,633
<i>What's the only thing that has a
bigger mouth than Linda Lovelace?</i>

699
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,691
Right here!

700
00:41:51,693 --> 00:41:54,827
- Please, Miss Lovelace!
- Linda!

701
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,632
- Linda.
- That's what I call a welcoming committee.

702
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:02,368
- Right on.
- Linda.

703
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,338
- Hi, Mr. Hefner.
- Hef, please.

704
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,208
Welcome to your party.
How about I trade you

705
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,710
- two blondes for a brunette?
- Yeah.

706
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:13,679
<i>Hear your mama come</i>

707
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:15,614
<i>You're the best
that she ever had</i>

708
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,249
You come with me.

709
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:19,218
<i>Yeah, mama won't you ride...</i>

710
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,554
- Look at this.
- Butchie Peraino.

711
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:23,889
- Big fan of yours, Mr. Hefner.
- Thanks.

712
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:25,824
Anthony Romano, Mr. Hefner.

713
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:28,560
Love the magazine. Love the article
about the swinger parties.

714
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:32,631
Thank you. You, Harry, I'm
a big fan of your work.

715
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,765
It is truly an honor, sir.

716
00:42:34,767 --> 00:42:36,934
Oh, I used to tell people
that I had the best job

717
00:42:36,936 --> 00:42:39,237
in the world until
I saw what you do.

718
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:43,574
We'll see you
gentlemen inside.

719
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:52,550
- Look at these two cool cats.
- Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.

720
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:55,586
- Miss Lovelace.
- Sammy Davis Jr.

721
00:42:55,588 --> 00:42:58,255
Better not miss this show.

722
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:14,371
<i>- They love you.
- Makes me feel sort of tingly all over,</i>

723
00:43:14,373 --> 00:43:17,841
<i>and then nothing. There's
got to be more to sex</i>

724
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:21,611
<i>than just a lot of
little tingles.</i>

725
00:43:21,613 --> 00:43:23,979
<i>There's gotta be bells ringing</i>

726
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:28,417
<i>and dams bursting and bombs
going off, something!</i>

727
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:31,553
<i>You wanna get off, or you
want to wreck a city?</i>

728
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:33,822
I think you can be a star.

729
00:43:34,924 --> 00:43:37,526
I don't mean just an
adult-movie star.

730
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:40,496
I mean a real star.

731
00:43:40,498 --> 00:43:44,466
Oh, I wish I could
believe that.

732
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:47,970
Well, trust me. I
see tons of girls

733
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:49,971
go through this town every year.

734
00:43:49,973 --> 00:43:52,607
Most of them...

735
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:53,975
...go just like that.

736
00:43:59,081 --> 00:44:01,916
<i>I hear bells ringing...</i>

737
00:44:01,918 --> 00:44:04,886
<i>...and dams bursting,</i>

738
00:44:04,888 --> 00:44:07,755
<i>and bombs going off!</i>

739
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,905
- Fabulous.
- Very sexy, right? Right?

740
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:27,007
No question. We're
getting laid tonight.

741
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:29,710
- We got a hit. We got a hit!
- No question.

742
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:38,617
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment
we've all been waiting for,

743
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:43,422
the one, the only,
Linda Lovelace!

744
00:45:15,454 --> 00:45:17,789
Are you ready for this?

745
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:20,892
I want to set the
record straight.

746
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:26,674
All right, the first few are
just to establish a baseline,

747
00:45:26,847 --> 00:45:28,822
so just answer yes or no.

748
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:36,640
Is your name Linda Lovelace?

749
00:45:38,644 --> 00:45:41,912
Can we start with
an easier question?

750
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:45,048
All right. Are you currently
working on a book

751
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:49,119
- about your life with Chuck Traynor?
- Yes.

752
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:52,723
Are you taking this polygraph at
the request of the publisher?

753
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:54,724
Yes.

754
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:58,428
Were you married
to Chuck Traynor?

755
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,147
- Chuck, you're hurting me.
- I know. I know. I know.

756
00:46:27,757 --> 00:46:29,825
- Chuck...
- Sh!

757
00:46:29,827 --> 00:46:32,994
Chuck! Easy.

758
00:46:32,996 --> 00:46:35,197
Chuck!

759
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,532
Stop it. Stop it, Chuck.

760
00:46:37,534 --> 00:46:39,468
Chuck, s...

761
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,170
Oh, shh.

762
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,891
Hey.

763
00:47:07,195 --> 00:47:11,130
Oh, God, that was
fucking far out.

764
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:15,969
Hey, come on.

765
00:47:15,971 --> 00:47:18,104
Baby, you're my wife.

766
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:21,174
Don't trip out.

767
00:47:21,176 --> 00:47:23,510
Hey.

768
00:47:23,512 --> 00:47:26,679
You really hurt me, Chuck.

769
00:47:29,617 --> 00:47:31,284
That was passion.

770
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,922
I love you.

771
00:47:39,826 --> 00:47:43,629
Where's my girl?
Where's my girl?

772
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:46,131
You're my girl, right?

773
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:48,767
- Right.
- Yeah? Say it.

774
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:51,603
Say it.

775
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:54,206
- I'm your girl.
- Don't...

776
00:47:56,175 --> 00:47:58,809
Hey. Hey.

777
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:07,118
<i>What do you mean by...
Prostitution?</i>

778
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,953
<i>Wives can't testify

779
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:11,188
<i>All just that shakedown.</i>

780
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:14,091
<i>All I need is money.</i>

781
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,829
Baby, do we have enough?

782
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:22,700
It's just you and me.
We can't miss.

783
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,097
<i>Hold up</i>

784
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,266
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

785
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:00,235
<i>Who's that girl
knocking 'em dead</i>

786
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,272
<i>Whenever she's in town?</i>

787
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:07,343
This is sure as shit more fun
than the convention, huh?

788
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:10,212
What do you do for a living?

789
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:14,349
I sell medical supplies.
How about you?

790
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:19,253
- Uh, I'm a part-time gynecologist.
- Really? Oh, that's so funny.

791
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:23,057
We're actually coming out with a new
set of stirrups that make it a lot...

792
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:27,061
I get it. That's
very funny, yeah.

793
00:49:27,063 --> 00:49:30,264
- Should I take some drink orders?
- Yeah, yeah. What do you want?

794
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:34,736
- Oh, wow. A Cuba Libre would be great.
- Two Cuba Libres.

795
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,705
Don't worry about that. I got it.
Here you go.

796
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:42,042
Boy, she's... she's great.

797
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:44,144
- Mm-hmm.
- You guys married?

798
00:49:44,146 --> 00:49:47,347
- Yeah, she's gonna be a star.
- Wow.

799
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,222
Hey, is that what
I think it is?

800
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,692
It is if you think it's coke.

801
00:50:00,294 --> 00:50:03,763
Do you, uh, think I
could get a little?

802
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:07,333
You let people use your, um,
medical supplies for free?

803
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:09,435
- Okay. No, I get it.
- Yeah.

804
00:50:09,437 --> 00:50:13,139
Yeah. Um... Well, how much?

805
00:50:13,141 --> 00:50:16,976
How much for what? The
pussy or the blow?

806
00:50:20,247 --> 00:50:22,815
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

807
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:25,718
<i>Would you let it ride?
Would you let it...</i>

808
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,987
It's your lucky day. I'm
gonna go get Linda.

809
00:50:30,122 --> 00:50:32,947
<i>Try, try, try Let it ride</i>

810
00:50:34,544 --> 00:50:37,394
<i>Try, try, try Let it ride</i>

811
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:38,163
Hey, look at me.

812
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:40,799
<i>Try, try, try</i>

813
00:50:40,801 --> 00:50:42,934
<i>Let it ride</i>

814
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:14,732
- Hi, Ma.
- For the love of Christ, it's 2 am.

815
00:51:14,734 --> 00:51:17,501
I know. I know.

816
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:24,006
Don't wake your father.

817
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:31,013
You want something to eat?
I got leftovers.

818
00:51:31,015 --> 00:51:35,251
- You're a bag of bones, Linda.
- No, I'm not hungry, Mom.

819
00:51:35,253 --> 00:51:38,354
So, what'd you wake me up in
the middle of the night for?

820
00:51:40,357 --> 00:51:44,960
I was really hoping that,
uh, I could, um...

821
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:47,329
...move back in
here for a while.

822
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:49,331
- Here?
- Yeah.

823
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:52,000
No. You know that's
not possible.

824
00:51:52,002 --> 00:51:55,971
- Why not?
- How would it look for a married woman

825
00:51:55,973 --> 00:51:59,441
to move in with her parents
apart from her husband?

826
00:52:02,345 --> 00:52:03,979
He hits me, Ma.

827
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:12,319
I can't say I'm surprised.

828
00:52:14,022 --> 00:52:16,023
What did you do?

829
00:52:16,025 --> 00:52:17,892
What do you mean, what'd I do?

830
00:52:17,894 --> 00:52:20,828
What did you do to
make him angry?

831
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:24,064
He didn't just hit
you out of the Blue.

832
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:30,204
I guess I didn't do
what he wanted me to.

833
00:52:30,206 --> 00:52:33,173
You took a vow,

834
00:52:33,175 --> 00:52:35,542
a very serious vow.

835
00:52:38,979 --> 00:52:42,882
Can't I just stay, like,
a few days, Ma, please?

836
00:52:42,884 --> 00:52:46,085
And then what? You
gonna get a divorce?

837
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:47,887
What do you think
we are, Protestant?

838
00:52:47,889 --> 00:52:49,956
Ma, you just don't understand.

839
00:52:51,325 --> 00:52:56,029
Linda, I was...

840
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:03,035
I was 18 years old when
I had your sister,

841
00:53:03,037 --> 00:53:06,171
unmarried...

842
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:09,408
...and all alone,

843
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,944
before I met your father.

844
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:16,615
I'd suffered long and hard.

845
00:53:17,784 --> 00:53:23,254
How dare you come here and
tell me I don't understand.

846
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:25,389
I understand.

847
00:53:27,626 --> 00:53:31,863
Now, God gave you a husband,

848
00:53:31,865 --> 00:53:33,898
who provides for you.

849
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,234
And you...

850
00:53:38,871 --> 00:53:40,571
Look at me.

851
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,976
Go home to Chuck.

852
00:53:44,978 --> 00:53:47,411
Be a good wife.

853
00:53:47,413 --> 00:53:52,315
Listen to him, and obey him.

854
00:53:55,386 --> 00:53:58,889
Can't I just stay for a
little while, Mom, please?

855
00:53:58,891 --> 00:54:01,124
Just please?

856
00:54:01,126 --> 00:54:05,962
Mom, I just need,
like, a day, please.

857
00:54:05,964 --> 00:54:08,398
- If you knew...
- That's enough.

858
00:54:12,502 --> 00:54:16,405
<i>- Hello?
- Dorothy, it's Chuck.</i>

859
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:18,574
Hi, Chuck.

860
00:54:18,576 --> 00:54:21,510
<i>- I'm sorry. It's late.
- Yeah.</i>

861
00:54:21,512 --> 00:54:24,613
<i>I'm looking for Linda.
You know where she is?</i>

862
00:54:34,491 --> 00:54:37,159
Yah!

863
00:54:39,962 --> 00:54:41,529
I can't do it.

864
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:43,398
I can't do it anymore.

865
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:43,900
Yeah?

866
00:54:48,938 --> 00:54:50,071
You can't do what?

867
00:54:50,073 --> 00:54:52,206
Everything. I can't do it.

868
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:54,242
You're doing the movie, Linda.

869
00:55:03,685 --> 00:55:06,320
You know me, right?

870
00:55:06,322 --> 00:55:10,023
Huh? You believe me?

871
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:13,226
Right? You believe me?

872
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:16,296
Do you believe me?

873
00:55:16,298 --> 00:55:18,065
Okay.

874
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:20,734
'Cause I worked
too fucking hard

875
00:55:20,736 --> 00:55:23,670
to get you this part.

876
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:29,375
Now, you watch.

877
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:33,245
This movie is gonna make us.

878
00:55:34,114 --> 00:55:38,084
You and me, Okay?

879
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,389
Oh.

880
00:55:43,391 --> 00:55:46,125
Oh, there, there,
Mrs. Lovelace.

881
00:55:46,127 --> 00:55:48,227
It's all right. Listen. It's
better to have a clitoris

882
00:55:48,229 --> 00:55:50,463
deep down in the bottom of
your throat than to have

883
00:55:50,465 --> 00:55:56,201
- no clitoris at all.
- That's easy for you say.

884
00:55:56,203 --> 00:55:59,270
What if your balls
were in your ears?

885
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:03,341
Well, then, I'd
hear myself coming.

886
00:56:05,444 --> 00:56:07,412
And cut!

887
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:10,448
That was great. That was great!
That was fantastic.

888
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,417
- We good?
- Yeah, we got it.

889
00:56:12,419 --> 00:56:14,352
Great work, everybody.
That's a wrap.

890
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:16,388
2 days down. Five to go.

891
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,422
Here's your damn film.

892
00:56:18,424 --> 00:56:19,584
Why don't you sit on his lap?

893
00:56:23,595 --> 00:56:26,096
Who's in the next room?

894
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:29,033
Man, I don't think
that's them balling.

895
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:31,602
Oh!

896
00:56:44,314 --> 00:56:46,682
If I tell you to sit,

897
00:56:46,684 --> 00:56:49,419
stay, screw, fuck,

898
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:53,122
you'll do it, hmm?

Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
you look so beautiful.

903

And you look like a
poodle with a perm.

904
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:37,498
I'm kidding. You
look beautiful.

905
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,867
- Hey, Chuck.
- Hey, Patsy.

906
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:41,702
You look older.

All right, hurry it up. You
guys want to be quick?

I got some real important people
we gotta meet up with later.

909
00:57:48,777 --> 00:57:52,713
Yeah. Picked out some dresses.
They're in the changing room.

910
00:57:52,715 --> 00:57:55,182
Go on.

911
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:58,651
Wow, you look stunning.

912
00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:04,324
Linda, can I be honest
with you about something?

913
00:58:04,326 --> 00:58:08,361
- Yeah, of course.
- I'm worried about you.

914
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:11,431
- Why? Because of the movie?
- No.

915
00:58:11,433 --> 00:58:14,400
I don't care about the movie.

916
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:16,436
It's everything. It's Chuck.
It's the people you...

917
00:58:19,406 --> 00:58:21,174
Don't be crazy.

918
00:58:21,176 --> 00:58:23,475
What is going on?

919
00:58:24,844 --> 00:58:26,712
It's Chuck, isn't it?

920
00:58:26,714 --> 00:58:29,915
Just tell me so I can help you.

921
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:33,152
Please? Please?

922
00:58:45,598 --> 00:58:47,698
Do you know how lucky I am?

923
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:52,236
I mean, a... a girl like me
landing a guy like Chuck?

924

I'm nothing without him.

925
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:58,743
Jesus, Linda, you know
we're in a hurry.

926
00:58:58,745 --> 00:59:00,811
Sorry.

927
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:04,715
Okay.

928
00:59:13,491 --> 00:59:17,460
- Hey, little toast. - No, no.
- I'd like to propose a toast.

929
00:59:17,462 --> 00:59:19,196
- All right, Harry.
- Oh.

930
00:59:19,198 --> 00:59:20,931
To Linda, for sharing with me

931
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,333
the ten best minutes of
my professional career.

932
00:59:23,335 --> 00:59:27,270
I heard it was the best ten seconds
of your career on the first day.

933
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,840
- Leave it to the broad to get honest.
- What about me?

934
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:34,344
You fucked me. If the movie's
such a hit, where's my cut?

935
00:59:34,346 --> 00:59:37,446
<i>I told Linda we're gonna double
her salary on Deep Throat 2.</i>

00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,782
She's gonna get $2,500.
How about that?

937
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,618
- You told Linda?
- Yeah.

938
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:48,257
Let me see the picture. It's
a full-on irregular pose.

939
00:59:48,259 --> 00:59:49,725
No.

940
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:53,762
No. No! Chuck. Chuck, no!

941
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:57,499
Chuck, it's freezing! God!

942
00:59:57,501 --> 00:59:59,835
Chuck!

943
01:00:01,805 --> 01:00:04,706
It was stupid. I spoke
to Butchie Peraino

944
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:06,641
about my salary for the sequel.

945
01:00:06,643 --> 01:00:08,743
I never spoke to anybody
about money after that,

946
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:10,278
that's for sure.

947
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,348
Did Chuck control
your finances?

948
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,483
Yes, he controlled everything.

949
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:20,855
<i>I never saw a penny, not even
after we moved to Malibu.</i>

950
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:27,995
<i>Yeah, but the price
break doesn't...</i>

951
01:00:27,997 --> 01:00:30,430
I get pitched this
shit all the time.

952
01:00:30,432 --> 01:00:32,299
It's gotta be something special.

953
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:34,368
<i>- These are special.
- Could you make it glow?</i>

954
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,937
<i>- Huh?
- Like glow in the dark?</i>

955
01:00:36,939 --> 01:00:39,573
<i>Yeah, that'd be groovy, right?</i>

956
01:00:39,575 --> 01:00:42,709
And it should say
"Lovelace" on the side,

957
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:45,045
and then Chuck Traynor
on the other side.

958
01:00:45,047 --> 01:00:47,581
<i>- Why would you want your name on the side?
- It's America, man!</i>

959
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:49,349
Why wouldn't I want my name
on the side of a dildo?

960
01:00:49,351 --> 01:00:51,752
<i>You got it. I'll send
'em out right away.</i>

961
01:00:51,754 --> 01:00:53,919
<i>- All right. Okay.
- Thanks.</i>

962
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:56,022
Talk to you later.

963
01:00:57,691 --> 01:00:59,692
All right, where'd
we leave off?

964
01:01:00,513 --> 01:01:03,660
Uh, part about the first
time I screwed Linda?

965
01:01:06,034 --> 01:01:07,667
"Chuck pushed me back."

966
01:01:07,669 --> 01:01:11,437
His fat, rock-like
muscle tore into me.

967
01:01:11,439 --> 01:01:15,574
- "Oh, my God, I said"
- What do you think?

968
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:21,913
- Sounds good.
- But you got a problem with it.

969
01:01:21,915 --> 01:01:25,050
It's just that your
rock-like muscle

970
01:01:25,052 --> 01:01:27,552
seems to play an
inordinately large role

971
01:01:27,554 --> 01:01:30,789
- in Linda's autobiography.
- "Inordinately."

972
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:34,459
- How'd you get here?
- Mr. Hefner sent me.

973
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:36,861
Right. And how about the next
time I want your opinion,

974
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:40,765
I'll ask you what my
cock tastes like.

975
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:43,967
Yes, sir, boss. Reckon it
tastes like a pina colada.

976
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:46,470
Anthony.

977
01:01:46,472 --> 01:01:49,039
- Hey, Chuck. How you doing?
- Look who's here.

978
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:51,842
- Hi, Anthony.
- Look at you. Look at you.

979
01:01:51,844 --> 01:01:54,611
You're like a... You're like a
regular California girl. Come here.

980
01:01:54,613 --> 01:01:58,582
- I thought you were in Vegas.
- Yeah. I just came back from the pa...

981
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:03,020
- What, are you kidding me?
- It's gonna look more like her.

982
01:02:06,124 --> 01:02:08,491
Come outside. I want
to show you something.

983
01:02:08,493 --> 01:02:10,693
Great to see you, kid.

984
01:02:10,695 --> 01:02:13,062
- Jesus.
- Gonna put freckles.

985
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:15,031
Ah, Jesus.

986
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:17,800
How you been? Good to see you.

987
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:22,905
I bet you $10 the only thing

988
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:25,541
rock-like on that
man is his brain.

989
01:02:25,543 --> 01:02:28,444
You're gonna get
us into trouble.

990
01:02:28,446 --> 01:02:31,781
Baby, look at us. I think
we're already in trouble.

991
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:37,953
Good afternoon. Lovelace Enterprises.
Marsha speaking.

992
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:41,490
Nice car, Chuck. Must have
cost you a few dimes.

993
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:44,493
- I know why you're here.
- I should hope so.

994
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:49,131
I need a couple more weeks.

995
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:52,067
We got the Linda Lovelace blow-up dolls.
We got all the sex toys.

996
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:55,404
Hey, you're getting, like,
5 times your money back.

997
01:02:55,406 --> 01:02:58,406
Man, you want a blow-up doll?
I got a couple in the house.

998
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:02,042
I don't want a fucking blow-up doll.
I want my 25 grand.

999
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:05,746
You'll get it. You're in on the
ground floor. We got the...

1000
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,148
<i>We got the Playboy
spread coming out.</i>

1001
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,983
- Mm-hmm.
- She's a brand name.

1002
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,684
She's like Betty
fucking Crocker.

1003
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,653
No, she's Linda
fucking Lovelace.

1004
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:15,623
Listen to me. You
want to pay us back,

1005
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,858
you get her doing
what she's good at.

1006
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,762
<i>Now, I got Deep Throat 2,
3, 4 lined up, ready to go.</i>

1007
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:23,797
- No...
- Now, this is big business we're talking about,

1008
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:27,066
not some fucking nickel-and-dime
shit you're talking about.

1009
01:03:27,068 --> 01:03:31,538
See, that's where you're wrong.
This isn't small-time.

1010
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,441
I'm meeting this guy
at Hef's party, Okay?

1011
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,743
This guy, he owns half
the adult bookstores

1012
01:03:36,745 --> 01:03:40,180
on the West Coast,
millions in merchandise.

1013
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:43,049
Linda, like, sweet
talks this guy, right?

1014
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:45,552
Or better yet, she
sweet sucks this guy,

1015
01:03:45,554 --> 01:03:48,587
we're made in the shade!

1016
01:03:48,589 --> 01:03:50,656
Come on. You worry too much.

1017
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:53,158
We're talking about
money, Chuck.

1018
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:56,695
I always worry about money.

1019
01:03:59,532 --> 01:04:02,568
<i>Well, what do I have to lose?</i>

1020
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:07,906
You know how sometimes...
life imitates art?

1021
01:04:11,877 --> 01:04:14,579
I think, um...

1022
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:17,815
I think this is one
of those moments.

1023
01:04:57,288 --> 01:05:00,624
Chuck seems to have
left with the car.

1024
01:05:00,626 --> 01:05:03,859
Yeah. I see he hasn't changed.

1025
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:08,130
- Well, come on. I'll give you a lift.
- Really?

1026
01:05:08,132 --> 01:05:10,900
Hey, why don't
we go someplace?

1027
01:05:10,902 --> 01:05:15,738
Let's grab a drink somewhere.

1028
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,941
- You don't want to?
- It's probably best just to take you home, Linda.

1029
01:05:18,943 --> 01:05:20,910
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

1030
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:41,796
Chuck!

1031
01:05:58,846 --> 01:06:00,013
Hello?

1032
01:06:00,015 --> 01:06:01,815
Hi, Daddy. Did I wake you?

1033
01:06:01,817 --> 01:06:04,818
No. No, no, no. We're
just getting up.

1034
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,955
It's late out there, huh?
It's Linda.

1035
01:06:07,957 --> 01:06:10,057
Well, who else would it
be at this time of day?

1036
01:06:10,059 --> 01:06:12,793
I just got home from a party.

1037
01:06:12,795 --> 01:06:14,928
Yeah, why am I not surprised?

1038
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,863
No, Daddy, it was
a business party.

1039
01:06:17,865 --> 01:06:21,233
But I met Sammy Davis Jr.

1040
01:06:21,235 --> 01:06:25,671
- Who's Sammy Davis Jr.?
- You know who he is. He's that colored guy,

1041
01:06:25,673 --> 01:06:29,108
you know, "Mr. Bojangles."

1042
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:33,012
<i>- She's right.
- I know who he is, Dorothy.</i>

1043
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:36,048
I was just joshing.

1044
01:06:39,753 --> 01:06:42,821
Your mother, she, uh...

1045
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:46,925
Every time that Johnny
Carson mentions your name,

1046
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:49,094
she changes the channel.

1047
01:06:52,398 --> 01:06:54,766
I saw your movie.

1048
01:06:59,071 --> 01:07:01,039
I don't even know who
that was up there.

1049
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:04,042
That's certainly not
my little girl.

1050
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:10,681
I had to walk out.

1051
01:07:14,886 --> 01:07:17,021
Was it something that we did?

1052
01:07:18,657 --> 01:07:21,859
<i>I keep thinking
that it has to be.</i>

1053
01:07:30,168 --> 01:07:33,703
I gotta go, Daddy.

1054
01:07:36,373 --> 01:07:39,208
I'll tell your mother you
said you're all right.

1055
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:41,744
I love you.

1056
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:50,386
I'm sorry, Chuck. I looked
everywhere for you.

1057
01:07:51,355 --> 01:07:54,957
You lost us a movie
deal tonight,

1058
01:07:54,959 --> 01:07:59,061
just sitting up onstage
taking bows like...

1059
01:07:59,063 --> 01:08:01,196
...Princess fucking Grace.

1060
01:08:01,198 --> 01:08:04,933
- I'm sorry, Chuck.
- 50, maybe 100,000.

1061
01:08:04,935 --> 01:08:08,236
- To do another fuck film?
- No, Linda, it's Shakespeare.

1062
01:08:08,238 --> 01:08:11,406
I told them you do a
great English accent,

1063
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:14,710
particularly with a
cock down your throat.

1064
01:08:18,014 --> 01:08:20,315
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1065
01:08:20,317 --> 01:08:22,917
I'm sorry, Chuck. I'm...

1066
01:08:22,919 --> 01:08:28,255
I'm not doing any more porn...
ever.

1067
01:08:45,774 --> 01:08:48,742
We're going to a party.
Come on.

1068
01:08:50,044 --> 01:08:53,313
- We just came from a party.
- Yeah.

1069
01:09:02,523 --> 01:09:05,425
All right, here it is.

1070
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:11,164
- Hey.
- How you doing?

1071
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:12,965
- Welcome to the party.
- Good to see you.

1072
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:15,134
This is Mr. Shapiro. He's a
big-time Hollywood producer.

1073
01:09:15,136 --> 01:09:18,871
<i>I'm a huge fan. I've seen
Throat, like, 10 times.</i>

1074
01:09:18,873 --> 01:09:21,273
You look like... Let's go inside.
It's cool. It's...

1075
01:09:21,275 --> 01:09:23,509
In fact, I'm shooting
something right now.

1076
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:25,110
- It'd be perfect for you.
- All right.

1077
01:09:25,112 --> 01:09:26,845
Oh, is that what this...
Is this an audition?

1078
01:09:26,847 --> 01:09:29,047
Linda Lovelace audition?
No, no.

1079
01:09:29,049 --> 01:09:32,017
- Give me a second.
- Absolutely. Sure.

1080
01:09:32,019 --> 01:09:35,487
Just give us some privacy
for a minute. Okay.

1081
01:09:35,489 --> 01:09:38,422
You just sit down right here.
Just have a seat.

1082
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:43,060
You will sit here and
say nothing, Okay?

1083
01:09:43,062 --> 01:09:46,430
<i>Keep shaking
everything you got</i>

1084
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,834
<i>Rock and boogie</i>

1085
01:09:49,836 --> 01:09:51,869
Chuck!

1086
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,971
Chuck!

1087
01:09:53,973 --> 01:09:56,474
- Ah, man, you know what?
- What?

1088
01:09:56,476 --> 01:09:58,042
- No. - No, no, no.
- Come on. Come on.

1089
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:02,479
What are you gonna do?

1090
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:05,115
No, it's gonna be 6 times the money. Hey!

1091
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,250
Listen to me! Come here.
Come here.

1092
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:09,186
- This is crazy.
- Come here.

1093
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:14,324
Come back in here. Shh!
Shut your mouth, Okay?

1094
01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:17,093
- You're gonna do this, you understand me?
- What?

1095
01:10:17,095 --> 01:10:19,830
You're gonna do...
Just shut it.

1096
01:10:19,832 --> 01:10:23,433
You're gonna do this,
and there's nothing you

1097
01:10:23,435 --> 01:10:28,137
or Hugh fucking Hefner can
do about it, all right?

1098
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,908
- We're Okay?
- Okay.

1099
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:38,848
Okay, Okay. I'll talk to her.

1100
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:42,518
Chuck.

1101
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,520
You know what? I don't
think this is gonna...

1102
01:10:44,522 --> 01:10:46,622
- Oh, no, no. This'll work fine.
- No.

1103
01:10:46,624 --> 01:10:49,225
Just... Yeah, it's just...
Okay, all right. That's...

1104
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:54,062
- Baby, got a good one.
- Chuck! Chuck!

1105
01:10:54,064 --> 01:10:57,999
No...

1106
01:10:59,602 --> 01:11:02,237
Aw, man. Hi.

1107
01:11:28,029 --> 01:11:30,130
You all right?

1108
01:11:35,603 --> 01:11:37,971
Hey! Hey!

1109
01:11:40,108 --> 01:11:42,341
Linda! Linda! Hey!

1110
01:11:46,114 --> 01:11:49,916
Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey!
Stay down. Stay down.

1111
01:11:49,918 --> 01:11:52,151
Oh, my God.

1112
01:11:57,157 --> 01:11:59,191
Oh, my God.

1113
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:06,598
Oh, Jesus. Get up.

1114
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,199
Get up.

1115
01:12:11,337 --> 01:12:14,139
Oh, shit.

1116
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:17,542
Step away from the lady!

1117
01:12:17,544 --> 01:12:19,678
- Sir, step away from the lady!
- She's my wife.

1118
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,148
- Step away from the lady now!
- Look, I'm her husband.

1119
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:26,718
- Is that true, ma'am?
- Yeah.

1120
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,420
Ma'am, are you Okay?

1121
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:35,426
Wait a minute. I know you.
You're that chick, right?

1122
01:12:35,428 --> 01:12:38,595
- That's Linda Lovelace.
- Blow-job girl?

1123
01:12:38,597 --> 01:12:42,733
Sir, take her home, and
get her cleaned up, Okay?

1124
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:46,370
- You have a good night.
- Yeah.

1125
01:12:47,505 --> 01:12:49,640
Uh, hey, Miss Lovelace?

1126
01:12:51,209 --> 01:12:55,312
Uh, think I could
have your autograph?

1127
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,217
Hi, operator.

1128
01:14:10,219 --> 01:14:13,253
I'd like to make
a collect call.

1129
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:22,796
I wanted to talk to you
about the money Chuck owes.

1130
01:14:24,733 --> 01:14:28,268
You mean, uh, the money
you and Chuck owe?

1131
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:31,304
Chuck always
handled the money,

1132
01:14:31,306 --> 01:14:33,073
so I've never seen any of it.

1133
01:14:33,075 --> 01:14:36,475
Okay, Linda, listen to me.
Just do another movie.

1134
01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:40,813
<i>Call it whatever you want, Really
Deep Throat, I don't care.</i>

1135
01:14:40,815 --> 01:14:45,084
One more movie, and
youse both out of debt.

1136
01:14:45,086 --> 01:14:47,719
The world wants to
see you, Linda,

1137
01:14:47,721 --> 01:14:50,255
but they only want to
see you do one thing.

1138
01:14:50,257 --> 01:14:52,825
You do another movie,
I'm gonna make sure

1139
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:56,128
it's a classy production, and you're
gonna have any director you want.

1140
01:14:56,130 --> 01:15:00,632
I'm gonna bring Harry back. Come on.
It'll be like old times.

1141
01:15:02,301 --> 01:15:04,235
Jesus.

1142
01:15:09,475 --> 01:15:12,343
I just can't do it anymore.

1143
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:26,356
- Here you go. Thanks.
- Thank you.

1144
01:16:15,907 --> 01:16:19,274
Hello? Linda?

1145
01:16:19,276 --> 01:16:21,476
<i>- Shh. Shh.
- Can I help you?</i>

1146
01:16:21,478 --> 01:16:27,282
Linda, it's Chuck, and I told
you I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1147
01:16:27,284 --> 01:16:31,519
<i>- This is the hotel operator.
- Oh.</i>

1148
01:16:31,521 --> 01:16:33,721
Um...

1149
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:36,224
Traynor. Traynor's room.

1150
01:16:36,226 --> 01:16:37,425
<i>Could you spell that, please?</i>

1151
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:41,261
Traynor, T-r-a-y-n-o-r?

1152
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:44,932
<i>- T-r-a-y-n-o-r?
- Yeah.</i>

1153
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,900
<i>Checking.</i>

1154
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,336
<i>I'm sorry. I don't see
a guest by that name.</i>

1155
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:53,574
Try Boreman. B-o-r-e-e-m-a-n?

1156
01:16:53,576 --> 01:16:56,843
<i>- B-o-r-e-e-m-a-n?
- Um...</i>

1157
01:16:56,845 --> 01:17:00,614
<i>Any other... another name?</i>

1158
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:04,284
Uh, Lovelace?

1159
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:08,621
<i>I'm sorry. There isn't a
guest under that name.</i>

1160
01:17:08,623 --> 01:17:10,690
<i>Hello?</i>

1161
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,600
You stupid bitch.

1162
01:18:01,806 --> 01:18:03,907
Fuck.

1163
01:18:20,891 --> 01:18:23,693
Linda? Linda?

1164
01:18:23,695 --> 01:18:25,061
Linda?

1165
01:18:26,897 --> 01:18:29,299
Hey, Charlie.

1166
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:33,469
Um... I thought you said
Linda was staying here.

1167
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:38,574
She was. We switched
rooms this morning.

1168
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:41,744
You're gonna have to find yourself
a new porn star, Charlie.

1169
01:18:41,746 --> 01:18:44,080
Um...

1170
01:18:44,082 --> 01:18:47,449
Hey. Hey, man. Is...?

1171
01:18:51,387 --> 01:18:53,355
No. No, no, no, no.

1172
01:18:53,357 --> 01:18:55,691
- Turn around. Turn around.
- No.

1173
01:18:58,795 --> 01:19:01,830
Aah!

1174
01:19:08,004 --> 01:19:09,905
Fucker. You're not gonna...

1175
01:19:09,907 --> 01:19:11,639
You're not gonna see her!

1176
01:19:11,641 --> 01:19:14,542
You're not gonna
think about her!

1177
01:19:59,687 --> 01:20:02,121
Hello?

1178
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:04,089
This is Linda Marchiano.

1179
01:20:09,796 --> 01:20:11,730
Oh, my God.

1180
01:20:12,966 --> 01:20:15,000
Okay.

1181
01:20:15,835 --> 01:20:19,171
Okay. Okay, bye.

1182
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:26,043
That was my publisher.

1183
01:20:26,045 --> 01:20:28,112
I passed the polygraph.

1184
01:20:29,848 --> 01:20:31,883
They believe me.

1185
01:20:33,419 --> 01:20:35,553
You really want this?

1186
01:20:37,523 --> 01:20:41,125
I just really want people to
know what happened, you know.

1187
01:20:45,664 --> 01:20:47,765
Well, we'll explain
in just a moment, uh,

1188
01:20:47,767 --> 01:20:50,134
why she is no
longer this person.

1189
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:52,736
I hope she won't be offended
if I identify her by the name

1190
01:20:52,738 --> 01:20:55,071
<i>that really has
become world-famous,</i>

1191
01:20:55,073 --> 01:20:56,673
<i>a woman who starred in
what has been called</i>

1192
01:20:56,675 --> 01:20:58,642
<i>the Gone With the
Wind of pornography.</i>

1193
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:01,511
<i>Would you please welcome
Linda Lovelace?</i>

1194
01:21:11,222 --> 01:21:13,990
<i>Linda Lovelace's book
is titled Ordeal,</i>

1195
01:21:13,992 --> 01:21:16,058
and it really was.
This is the...

1196
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,893
This is the grimmest book
I've ever read in my life.

1197
01:21:17,895 --> 01:21:19,528
I mean, you've been
beaten, knocked around,

1198
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:21,831
I mean, every liberty
in the world.

1199
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,933
<i>How'd you get involved
with all that stuff?</i>

1200
01:21:23,935 --> 01:21:27,570
<i>I mean, how could a nice girl like you...
How do you answer that?</i>

1201
01:21:27,572 --> 01:21:31,106
<i>Well, I had the misfortune
of meeting Chuck Traynor.</i>

1202
01:21:31,108 --> 01:21:33,676
<i>But it didn't start out
like you're describing.</i>

1203
01:21:33,678 --> 01:21:37,480
<i>He was a... a gentleman
when I first met him.</i>

1204
01:21:37,482 --> 01:21:40,549
He was always opening doors for
me and lighting my cigarettes,

1205
01:21:40,551 --> 01:21:43,751
and he was very charming
when he wanted to be.

1206
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:46,721
<i>And I was young, you know.
I was...</i>

1207
01:21:46,723 --> 01:21:51,893
<i>I was 21 when I went
to live with him.</i>

1208
01:21:51,895 --> 01:21:57,699
<i>And it wasn't until after that that
things just started to change.</i>

1209
01:21:57,701 --> 01:22:03,505
<i>Uh, he started talking about
different sexual things,</i>

1210
01:22:03,507 --> 01:22:07,875
<i>things that I had never
heard of before,</i>

1211
01:22:07,877 --> 01:22:11,078
<i>things that I couldn't
imagine, you know.</i>

1212
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,181
<i>I didn't want to. You
know, I was raised...</i>

1213
01:22:14,183 --> 01:22:17,818
<i>I was raised to
obey my husband,</i>

1214
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:21,121
<i>to please him, for
better or for worse,</i>

1215
01:22:21,123 --> 01:22:25,225
- so that's what I did.
- Dear God.

1216
01:22:27,161 --> 01:22:29,630
<i>Linda, I have read
your book, Ordeal,</i>

1217
01:22:29,632 --> 01:22:32,298
and I still find it very
hard to relate to you

1218
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:35,134
and to believe that you have
become a changed person.

1219
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:38,771
<i>I expect people to
have great difficulty</i>

1220
01:22:38,773 --> 01:22:41,107
<i>realizing how hard it
was for me to get out,</i>

1221
01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:44,243
<i>but I think people
who have known fear</i>

1222
01:22:44,245 --> 01:22:46,913
<i>will understand it,
though, immediately.</i>

1223
01:22:46,915 --> 01:22:49,982
Linda, do you think this
book will help bring about,

1224
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:53,553
you know, any change for other girls
that are in this predicament?

1225
01:22:53,555 --> 01:22:56,621
I do have that hope. I... God
forbid there's somebody out there

1226
01:22:56,623 --> 01:22:59,291
that's going through
what I went through.

1227
01:22:59,293 --> 01:23:03,295
<i>And maybe they can get the
courage to get out of it.</i>

1228
01:23:03,297 --> 01:23:07,332
<i>I hope this book helps
her to realize that...</i>

1229
01:23:07,334 --> 01:23:11,102
...that you can come out of
this a complete person again.

1230
01:23:11,104 --> 01:23:14,639
<i>Linda, you really were, and are, but
especially in the early seventies,</i>

1231
01:23:14,641 --> 01:23:17,275
<i>you were quite a celebrity.
Everybody talked about you.</i>

1232
01:23:17,277 --> 01:23:23,080
All conversations about you
include a normal statement

1233
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:25,082
that comes out dirty
because of the context.

1234
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:26,684
<i>That's an awful way for you...</i>

1235
01:23:26,686 --> 01:23:28,118
<i>That's gonna follow
you forever.</i>

1236
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,688
<i>You know, I spent
exactly 17 days</i>

1237
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:36,026
<i>in the pornography industry,
and somehow these 17 days</i>

1238
01:23:36,028 --> 01:23:38,128
<i>are supposed to define who I
am for the rest of my life,</i>

1239
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:42,800
<i>but I hope that
people can see me</i>

1240
01:23:42,802 --> 01:23:44,702
for who I really am.

1241
01:23:44,704 --> 01:23:47,971
<i>I mean, Linda Lovelace was
a fictitious character.</i>

1242
01:23:47,973 --> 01:23:50,306
<i>My name is Linda Marchiano.</i>

1243
01:23:50,308 --> 01:23:53,009
I can finally be myself.

1244
01:23:53,011 --> 01:23:55,712
I'm a mother and a wife,

1245
01:23:55,714 --> 01:23:58,815
and that is where
I found my joy.

1246
01:24:11,828 --> 01:24:14,763
Go ahead. We'll give you
a minute, all right?

1247
01:24:14,765 --> 01:24:16,198
Okay.

1248
01:24:30,146 --> 01:24:32,414
You made it.

1249
01:25:14,889 --> 01:25:17,390
I love you, Mom.

1250
01:25:21,429 --> 01:25:25,931
Oh, let's not make a
federal case out of this.

1251
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,735
- Hey.
- Hi.

1252
01:25:29,737 --> 01:25:32,938
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

1253
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:35,741
Let's get you
something to eat.

1254
01:25:35,743 --> 01:25:37,910
Good to see you. How you doing?
What have we got here?

1255
01:25:37,912 --> 01:25:42,314
Oh. Good to see you, man.
How you doing?
