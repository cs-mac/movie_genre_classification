00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,227
THE DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID

2
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,628
Hey, over here!

3
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:27,710
You from "The Priory"?

4
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:30,947
Is it far?

5
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:34,850
You'll find out soon enough.
Get in.

6
00:03:57,743 --> 00:04:00,234
The countryside's always
a bit dreary.

7
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:09,512
People probably don't have
much fun around here.

8
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,462
Those your only shoes?

9
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:31,602
What was that?
I didn't understand.

10
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:35,071
Right, play the innocent.

11
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:09,643
- What's your name?
- Joseph.

12
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:11,850
That's all I needed.

13
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,897
Ralph!
Come on, boy!

14
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:16,647
- What are you doing around here?
- Nothing.

15
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:18,140
Good hunting?

16
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:21,619
I ran into her, so I bought
this off her.

17
00:06:21,854 --> 00:06:22,843
As usual.

18
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:26,287
Did you make that?
It's very nice.

19
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:28,056
No, Mama did.

20
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,295
You're filthy.

21
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:35,222
Here, blow your nose.

22
00:06:39,505 --> 00:06:40,267
Harder!

23
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,668
Now run along.

24
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:47,842
You're not very clean either.
Why haven't you shaved?

25
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:52,913
I was up at 4 a.m. And
I've already done 6 miles in the woods.

26
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:55,314
What did you kill today?

27
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:56,710
Nothing much.

28
00:06:57,723 --> 00:06:58,815
No, I don't want to see!

29
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:02,693
Aren't animals more beautiful alive
rather than dead?

30
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,730
Hunting... is hunting.

31
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:13,865
Careful how you handle this.
It's very fragile.

32
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:16,502
Father is fond of it and it's costly.

33
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:17,964
Yes, Madame.

34
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:20,937
- Do you break things?
- No, Madame.

35
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:24,710
You all say that.
Unfortunately, the facts prove otherwise.

36
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,210
Take off your shoes.
My father is very strict about that.

37
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:30,985
This is a valuable Chinese rug.

38
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:34,616
You'll track dirt in.

39
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:38,720
Only Father keeps his shoes on.

40
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,964
But he's cleanliness itself.

41
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:45,160
Be careful with this, too.
It costs a fortune.

42
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:48,002
The mother of pearl and ivory
easily come unglued.

43
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:53,073
- Do you keep clean?
- Yes, Madame.

44
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:56,647
I overlook a good deal
but I'm a stickler for cleanliness.

45
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,644
Is your memory good?

46
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,419
Don't touch these.
I clean them.

47
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:06,719
You're clearly from Paris.
That dress won't do here.

48
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:10,891
You'll be in my father's service.

49
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,391
True, I hired you but...

50
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:17,330
Well, you'll have to please Father.

51
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:22,435
Father's a delightful person,
the kind you don't find anymore.

52
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:26,667
He has his whims which are
understandable for his age.

53
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:30,273
- Try to be very nice to him.
- I'll try, Madame.

54
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:33,275
Now go change your dress.

55
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:47,392
Most important, relax!
Fully relaxed!

56
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,424
Hold your breath.

57
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:51,324
Don't squeeze too hard.

58
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,859
Well, go on!

59
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:59,137
- You never used a gun before?
- I don't think so.

60
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,975
Nice! But I thought
you liked butterflies.

61
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:06,109
I do!
I would rather have missed it.

62
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:09,916
Now go clean up.
That beard is most unpleasant.

63
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:21,263
What pretty writing paper!

64
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,499
Is that a crown?

65
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:26,032
It's from the Duchess's.

66
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:30,567
"Celestine"...
She wrote your name on the picture!

67
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,643
Who's this on the horse?

68
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,106
William. He won the Grand Prix
at Longchamp 2 years ago.

69
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:40,849
- Is he English?
- Hardly!

70
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:45,419
You've known some fancy people!

71
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:47,115
What's it like here?

72
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:51,027
Madame's father is very nice.
Very kind, very polite.

73
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:52,323
- And her?
- Her?

74
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:54,263
A cow, that's obvious.

75
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,591
She counts the sugar cubes,
locks everything up!

76
00:09:57,636 --> 00:09:59,536
All the same.
And Monsieur?

77
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:01,573
Him?

78
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:05,969
Thanks for the tip.

79
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:08,804
It's obvious you're from Paris.

80
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:11,679
Such pretty things in your suitcase!

81
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:34,870
Marianne!

82
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:36,504
Would you like something, Monsieur?

83
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:40,439
Sure...
But who are you?

84
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,779
The new chambermaid, Monsieur.

85
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:47,046
Ah, yes...
Come in.

86
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:52,881
Good morning.

87
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:57,095
I'd like my...
my bathrobe.

88
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:01,426
I left it on my... my bed.
My bathrobe...

89
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,597
What's your name?

90
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:07,333
Celestine, Monsieur.

91
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:12,600
Pretty name.
Very pretty name.

92
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:14,636
Are you settled in all right?

93
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:18,016
- I just arrived this morning, Monsieur.
- True, true.

94
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:25,285
Excuse me, Monsieur, but where is
Monsieur's room?

95
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:27,219
What for, Celestine?

96
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:28,923
To get your bathrobe, Monsieur.

97
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:33,264
At the end of the hall.

98
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,264
Where are you going?

99
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,666
Monsieur asked for his bathrobe.

100
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:45,000
But it's in the bathroom!

101
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,935
Celestine, it was here,
I've got it!

102
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:54,710
Be careful with this lamp, too.

103
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:57,019
Be very careful.

104
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,322
The globe has to be
ordered from England.

105
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:03,719
That will be all.

106
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:22,045
- I think it's coming out!
- It's in the corner!

107
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,511
It's gone!

108
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:31,019
Filthy thing!

109
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:33,751
You'll see plenty of them around.

110
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,864
"Be careful with this lamp!
Be very careful!

111
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,460
"The globe has to be
ordered from England."

112
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:48,201
She send her cracked chamber
pots to London too?

113
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,434
I doubt I'll last 3 days in this dump.

114
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:55,270
They all say that.
But you'll stay.

115
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:59,578
Madame doesn't seem very keen
on you-know-what.

116
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:01,483
She have a lover?

117
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,281
- No.
- Why not?

118
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:05,817
- Apparently she can't.
- What?

119
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,722
She's sick!
It hurts her!

120
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:13,422
- So what? And Monsieur?
- He's a dead loss.

121
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,890
All he does is hunt.

122
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:28,001
You're sitting in Joseph's chair.

123
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:37,512
Get this lamp out of my way.

124
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,053
Bravo, Madame will be pleased.

125
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:48,866
- As if it was my fault!
- Or mine!

126
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:52,034
So I'll go to England
to buy a new globe.

127
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:57,864
They beat up some wops and
kikes in Paris last night.

128
00:13:58,243 --> 00:13:59,676
It's a good start!

129
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:03,576
Some folks here'll get theirs, too.
Not just wops and kikes!

130
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:05,177
He never lets up!

131
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:07,276
What are wops n' kikes?

132
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,012
Look at your mug in the mirror
and you'll see.

133
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,957
- Who's it for?
- For you.

134
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:21,924
Time for the old man's herb tea.

135
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,772
Listen to this...

136
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:33,772
"...But for the honor of our country,
an alternative Right does exist.

137
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:39,110
"Can it stand vertebrally and march
into combat united and determined?"

138
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:47,083
Just a moment!

139
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:01,065
Come in, come in.

140
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:06,674
So you're Celestine?

141
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,872
I really like the name.
Indeed, I do.

142
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:13,609
Put that down there.

143
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:18,052
But it's a bit too long,
don't you think?

144
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:22,557
Far too long.
If you don't mind, I'll call you Marie.

145
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:25,957
Marie is pretty too and it's short.

146
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:29,129
Besides, I've called all my
chambermaids Marie.

147
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:31,596
It's a habit of mine.

148
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,500
And not one
I think I could break.

149
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:38,133
- How many lumps, Monsieur?
- Two.

150
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,545
So you won't mind
if I call you Marie?

151
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:44,777
It's understood, then?

152
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:49,945
- Fine!
- I'll go now, if I may.

153
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:53,713
Not yet, Marie.
Do you have a moment?

154
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:55,825
I'm at Monsieur's service.

155
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,123
Tell me now,
do you enjoy reading?

156
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:03,499
Yes, but I don't have
much time for it.

157
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:05,800
But you know how to read?

158
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:10,703
There are evenings when
I'm feeling weary

159
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:12,503
and I enjoy being read to.

160
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:15,777
It's so pleasant to listen to
a charming voice.

161
00:16:16,214 --> 00:16:18,842
Why don't we have a little tryout?

162
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:21,007
Are you familiar with
Huysmans?

163
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,881
A fine writer.
I really appreciate him.

164
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:27,147
Sit down here a moment

165
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:30,485
and read me something at random.

166
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:33,357
Sit down.

167
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:35,729
Read, read.

168
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:39,796
"Since, in this day and age,

169
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:42,435
"nothing genuine remains,

170
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:46,037
"as the wine we drink
and the freedom we proclaim

171
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:48,412
"are adulterated and derisory,

172
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:52,279
"and as it takes a good dose
of good will

173
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:56,676
"to suppose that the ruling classes
are respectable

174
00:16:57,122 --> 00:17:01,582
"and the lower classes worthy
of relief or commiseration..."

175
00:17:01,726 --> 00:17:05,787
Marie, look...
would you mind if I touched your calf?

176
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,132
You've absolutely nothing
to fear from me.

177
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,394
You don't mind?

178
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:16,869
Keep reading...

179
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,937
"The dreadful,
bleeding head glowers,

180
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,241
"scattering... clots...

181
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,907
"of dark crimson

182
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,581
"over the tips of its beard and hair.

183
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:31,488
"Visible to Salome alone,

184
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:34,586
"it neither embraces
in its sinister gaze..."

185
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,894
Marie,
what size do you wear?

186
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:42,059
- What?
- Your shoe size.

187
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:47,335
5.

188
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,534
Just a moment!

189
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:54,475
Here they are...
"Rose des vents"!

190
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,180
Every evening
when you come to see me

191
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,614
you'll put these boots on.

192
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:02,786
They bring back memories,
you see?

193
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:04,882
No need to wear them
during the day,

194
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:07,821
but in the evening,
I'd appreciate it.

195
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:09,493
One moment!

196
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:14,096
Come in.

197
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:19,928
I asked you to be very careful
with this lamp!

198
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:23,674
- But I can explain...
- No explanations!

199
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:25,134
What's the problem?

200
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,807
She broke the lamp globe.

201
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:29,910
It's of no importance!
I never liked this lamp.

202
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:32,582
Be more careful in the future.

203
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:39,122
Always the same thing!

204
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:43,285
Every time you make an effort...
What pettiness!

205
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:47,355
My dear Marie, what can I say?
That's all for tonight.

206
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:49,831
You may go.
Thank you.

207
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,940
Pretty girl.
And good-natured.

208
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,215
Fine, fine.

209
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:27,967
Do the bedrooms
but don't bother with my bathroom.

210
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,141
Break out the glue!

211
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,997
Did you throw those stones?

212
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:33,901
So?
Don't like it?

213
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:35,530
What got into you?

214
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,375
I feel sorry for you.
You're in for it.

215
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:43,311
You work for a real scoundrel.

216
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:44,646
In what way?

217
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,380
So there you are at last!

218
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:52,119
You don't show yourself much.

219
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:54,216
Sure, you're from Paris...

220
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:57,127
we aren't good enough for you.

221
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:58,793
What an idea, Madame!

222
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,693
Not Madame, Mam'zelle!
Mam'zelle Rose!

223
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:07,130
She's more than just a servant.
She's a rarity among women!

224
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:09,063
You mad at Mr. Rabour?

225
00:21:09,474 --> 00:21:11,339
Old man Rabour?
Not at all!

226
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:13,611
I could care less
about that old cobbler!

227
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,010
It's his son-in-law, Monteil!

228
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:19,412
He's quite a number,
believe me!

229
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:22,550
He spreads nasty gossip about us.

230
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:24,582
Like Rose eating at my table.

231
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:26,389
What business is it of his?

232
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,820
If she shares my bed,
it's my right!

233
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:30,886
Of course!

234
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,693
It's quite normal
for a single man!

235
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:36,023
Monteil's a real scoundrel,
believe me!

236
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:40,095
He's funny. He's such a child.
So young for his age.

237
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:45,270
You're nice-Iooking.

238
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:48,778
Watch out.
There's already talk about you.

239
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:49,845
About me?

240
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:53,139
Don't do anything foolish.

241
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,917
They say you and Monteil...
Be careful.

242
00:21:56,254 --> 00:21:59,519
If Madame doesn't fire 'em,
Monsieur knocks 'em up.

243
00:21:59,657 --> 00:22:00,453
No risk of that!

244
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:04,860
Remember, with that fellow, bang!
The first time... a baby!

245
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:07,628
A downright scoundrel!

246
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:28,618
So, Celestine,
are you settled in now?

247
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:30,279
I don't know yet.

248
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:33,890
Is Monsieur settled in here?

249
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:36,988
Dammit, Celestine,
you must settle in!

250
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:39,256
You must!

251
00:22:39,998 --> 00:22:42,523
I'll try.
With Monsieur's help.

252
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:48,069
I bet you were up to mischief
in Paris.

253
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,073
What must Monsieur
think of me!

254
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:52,340
Why not?
A lovely girl like you!

255
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:55,570
I'm all for having fun, dammit!

256
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,911
I'm all for love, Celestine!
For I'amour fou!

257
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,814
I'll tell Madame.

258
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:05,484
Madame!
To hell with Madame!

259
00:23:05,623 --> 00:23:08,148
I've had it with Madame!
Think I'll just sit back?

260
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:11,190
Monsieur exaggerates.
Madame's always been kind.

261
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:12,952
Kind?

262
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:16,558
Listen, Celestine,
she's ruined my life.

263
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:19,564
I'm no longer a man.
I'm a laughingstock.

264
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:20,898
Care for a cookie?

265
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:28,303
I want so much
for you to be happy.

266
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:33,474
You're not like my wife.
You're so sweet and good.

267
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:37,015
- Lf you wanted to...
- What, Monsieur?

268
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:39,214
You know what.

269
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:41,483
Deceive Madame with Monsieur?

270
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:45,125
It's all I think about!
Since you arrived, I haven't slept!

271
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:49,697
I'm not a brute!
I promise I won't get you pregnant!

272
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,563
Stop or I'll tell Madame everything!

273
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:58,631
Give me time to settle in.

274
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:53,820
Kill it!
Don't let it suffer!

275
00:24:54,632 --> 00:24:56,998
They're better when they suffer.

276
00:24:58,336 --> 00:24:59,428
And I like it that way.

277
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,982
The house needs tidying up.

278
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:23,491
- Is Madame here?
- Next door.

279
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:25,519
I'm coming, Joseph.

280
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:32,000
It's fine-Iooking.

281
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,965
Yes, Madame,
more than 11 pounds.

282
00:25:34,872 --> 00:25:35,839
Put it here.

283
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,233
Do you want something?

284
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:42,268
Is there something
you want to tell me?

285
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:44,578
Let's hear it.

286
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,740
It's the new chambermaid.

287
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:50,051
What has she done?

288
00:25:50,488 --> 00:25:52,786
- She hasn't been here long but...
- But what?

289
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:54,887
She's always
talking to the neighbors.

290
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:58,922
Sunday she walked home
from mass with Rose.

291
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:01,160
Once she even went
into their garden.

292
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,929
Thank you, Joseph.
That will do.

293
00:26:19,116 --> 00:26:22,347
- Can I dunk my bread in the sauce?
- Sure!

294
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:49,045
What are you doing here?
Know what time it is?

295
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:51,346
You're not allowed in here.

296
00:26:51,816 --> 00:26:53,147
I told her to come in.

297
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:54,951
- Why?
- Because!

298
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:59,951
- So how's your aunt?
- Not very good.

299
00:27:01,425 --> 00:27:02,619
As usual.

300
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,590
Look me in the eye.
Straight in the eye.

301
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:11,159
What d'you see?

302
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:13,968
I see me.

303
00:27:15,106 --> 00:27:16,664
That shows I like you.

304
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:18,841
That I've got you in mind.

305
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:37,985
- No, thanks.
- Not hungry?

306
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:41,123
She prefers truffles.

307
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:43,127
I've eaten truffles before.

308
00:27:43,434 --> 00:27:44,901
No one here can say as much.

309
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:48,368
- Where's the butter?
- No butter.

310
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:51,004
Ask next door for the key.

311
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:52,908
Pass the bread.

312
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:03,714
While you're up,
pass me one.

313
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,081
I don't wait on tattletales.

314
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:09,088
On what?

315
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:11,224
I'll see the neighbors when I like.

316
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:14,086
So go tell them that next door.

317
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:15,896
I hear the dogs!

318
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:18,396
It must be the sexton.

319
00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:21,666
You're sleepy.

320
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:24,504
Come here.

321
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,443
Take this apple.

322
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:30,443
Come in.

323
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:31,673
'Evening, all!

324
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:33,977
See that rain?
Not very warm either.

325
00:28:34,752 --> 00:28:35,582
Sit down.

326
00:28:39,023 --> 00:28:40,047
Shouldn't the child be home?

327
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:41,123
She's all right here.

328
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:42,486
I'd like some cheese.

329
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:46,753
- Nice and warm in here!
- Have a drink.

330
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:50,327
I hear that in the Le Havre strike

331
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:52,561
they wounded
20 blue-collar bastards.

332
00:28:52,937 --> 00:28:54,131
A shame they didn't all croak!

333
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:57,174
And in Romania they killed 12 Jews.

334
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,801
That makes 12 less!
That's always something!

335
00:29:00,578 --> 00:29:02,512
- And Richard's article?
- Terrific!

336
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:05,281
Cheers!

337
00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:09,653
Why always talk about
killing Jews?

338
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:12,146
- Aren't you a patriot?
- Sure!

339
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,422
So?

340
00:29:13,858 --> 00:29:15,621
If I was in Paris,
I'd kill one a day!

341
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,960
The government ministers
and the judges have all sold out.

342
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,059
That's why things are so rotten!

343
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,059
Scratch a Bolshevik
and you'll find a Jew.

344
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:28,564
They're attacking religion again.

345
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:31,001
- Oh, priests...
- I know you hate 'em.

346
00:29:31,242 --> 00:29:34,268
But I'm for religion.
We need it.

347
00:29:34,545 --> 00:29:37,241
I told you, the clergy will help
get rid of the Jews.

348
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:43,943
For me again!

349
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:50,056
I'll put the kid to bed
in my room.

350
00:29:51,395 --> 00:29:52,828
I can take her home.

351
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,232
She's staying here with me.

352
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,965
- I won't eat her.
- My mind's made up.

353
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,365
Let's get down to it.

354
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:04,641
I don't want to turn in too late.

355
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:07,199
Get me some paper and ink.

356
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,451
Don't make any noise.

357
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:39,631
Tell me, Celestine...

358
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:43,513
Do maids in Paris
usually wear perfume?

359
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:45,274
It depends.

360
00:30:45,616 --> 00:30:48,141
Some wear perfume,
some don't.

361
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:51,788
Well, here we feel perfume
is improper for ladies.

362
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:55,454
- Especially maids, you understand?
- Very well, Madame.

363
00:30:57,128 --> 00:30:58,686
Take this away.
It stinks.

364
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,954
Take the cups, as well.

365
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:15,244
- Aren't you overdoing it, dear?
- Be quiet, you!

366
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:18,173
- And don't hang around that girl!
- Me?

367
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:21,512
The Jesureau girl last year
cost me 1500 francs!

368
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:25,086
But, dear, a girl like Celestine
who comes from Paris...

369
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,957
God knows the things she's done!

370
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,987
The diseases she's picked up!
And you accuse me?

371
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,420
I know you.

372
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:38,728
I'd hoped for a pleasant evening
with you after dinner,

373
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,359
but you immediately
start shouting!

374
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:42,472
I prefer going up to my room.

375
00:31:48,646 --> 00:31:49,738
Good night, Father.

376
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:56,649
Look, dear,
if you're worried about Celestine...

377
00:31:56,787 --> 00:32:00,223
I'm not jealous,
but I don't want it costing me any money!

378
00:32:50,908 --> 00:32:51,897
There!

379
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,475
"To French patriots!

380
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,976
"France has been delivered to
foreigners and sold for Jewish gold!

381
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,175
"The French army is scorned!

382
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:03,710
"The Catholic Church persecuted!

383
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:05,813
"Be prepared!

384
00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:08,990
"The hour of the National
Revolution is at hand!

385
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:12,793
"Enough lies and treason!
Enough scandals!"

386
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:14,826
Not "enough scandals."

387
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:16,893
"Enough filth"!
It has more clout.

388
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,230
Why are you staring at me?

389
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:26,299
I prefer "Enough scandals!"

390
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:28,772
Who asked you?

391
00:33:30,214 --> 00:33:33,183
"The hour of the
National Revolution is at hand!

392
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:35,642
"Enough lies and treason!

393
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,348
"Enough filth!"

394
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:56,962
Come in, Marie.

395
00:34:34,678 --> 00:34:35,702
What's this?

396
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:38,870
What are you doing?

397
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,445
- I was just...
- What?

398
00:34:42,353 --> 00:34:43,479
My shoes!

399
00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:45,381
Shoes?

400
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:47,083
Yes, Monsieur.

401
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:50,487
Not tonight, Marie.
You may go now.

402
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:54,792
Never mind.
You can pick it up tomorrow.

403
00:35:49,186 --> 00:35:50,414
So...

404
00:35:50,954 --> 00:35:52,785
- Coming to see me?
- Don't touch me.

405
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,982
Sweet little Celestine!

406
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,620
Settling in, are we?

407
00:35:59,863 --> 00:36:01,956
Let go!
Monsieur knows I'm a trollop.

408
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,064
- What're you saying?
- A dirty girl!

409
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:06,058
But, my little Celestine...

410
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:08,530
- I'm diseased.
- What?

411
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,866
I've got the pox.

412
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:13,774
Goddamn!
Goddamn!

413
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:16,039
Celestine, listen!

414
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,608
Nuts!

415
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:36,056
Hey, you!

416
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:39,931
Don't mind me!
Cutting my branches off now?

417
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:42,229
They're growing into my garden.

418
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,009
Don't like it?
I'm within my rights!

419
00:36:46,743 --> 00:36:48,802
I've just about had it with you!
Just look!

420
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:53,042
You not only throw me your garbage,
you cut my trees now!

421
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:56,715
- I'll take you to court!
- You name the day!

422
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,215
I have witnesses this time!

423
00:37:00,624 --> 00:37:02,353
Let's see your witnesses!

424
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,493
Joseph! He cut my branches.
You saw it, no?

425
00:37:06,897 --> 00:37:07,886
You agree?

426
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,867
Perfect!

427
00:37:11,301 --> 00:37:13,599
A servant!
Servants don't count.

428
00:37:14,004 --> 00:37:15,972
We'll see about that,
you scoundrel!

429
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:19,168
Oh, no,
we won't!

430
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,075
I'll drag you into court.

431
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:23,042
By force,
if need be.

432
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,747
Anytime you want!

433
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:27,679
We'll see your nerve,
you big coward!

434
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,423
Dirty Jew!

435
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:01,840
- Who is it?
- Me, Madame.

436
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:03,404
What do you want?

437
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:06,978
I can't do the bathroom now
because...

438
00:39:07,184 --> 00:39:09,846
It's done.
Don't come unless I call you.

439
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:23,121
Marie...
Come in here a minute.

440
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:42,176
Do you like them?

441
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:46,018
Not very clean, are they?

442
00:39:47,491 --> 00:39:48,355
Fine.

443
00:39:49,192 --> 00:39:51,558
Would you like to see others?

444
00:39:51,995 --> 00:39:54,361
Others?
I think these will do...

445
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:56,731
But in patent leather.

446
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:00,134
Fine patent leather!

447
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:04,470
Yellow leather!

448
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:08,276
They're the most beautiful!

449
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:11,180
You'll end up preferring them
to the others.

450
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:13,581
Thank you, Monsieur.

451
00:40:14,618 --> 00:40:18,213
Give me your hand and come
sit down.

452
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:26,025
All this must seem odd to you.

453
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,262
But at my age I can indulge
a few whims, can't I?

454
00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:33,765
For example...

455
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:36,639
Your boots are dirty.

456
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,639
I don't find it proper for a lady
to wax her boots.

457
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:44,477
I respect women too much for that.

458
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:47,110
So these dear little boots...

459
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:50,310
will be waxed by me.

460
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:56,257
Now get up...
and walk.

461
00:40:58,261 --> 00:40:59,558
Walk over there.

462
00:40:59,963 --> 00:41:02,090
Please lift your skirt a little.

463
00:41:06,036 --> 00:41:08,004
Go on, walk!

464
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:24,343
Let me see
those tiny boots move.

465
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:32,989
Let me see them live.
My "Rose des vents." Redi viva!

466
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:37,625
Show me the sole.

467
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:43,839
There are some holes.

468
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:46,903
I'll mend them
and they'll be like new.

469
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,768
That will do, Marie.

470
00:41:49,613 --> 00:41:52,776
Now come sit down.

471
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:57,182
Give me those little boots,
right this instant.

472
00:41:57,888 --> 00:41:59,412
I'll remove them

473
00:42:00,524 --> 00:42:04,790
and take them with me,
these dear little boots!

474
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:08,192
- Who is it?
- Me, Father!

475
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:09,389
What is it?

476
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:11,660
Will you have breakfast with me?

477
00:42:12,836 --> 00:42:14,030
Shall I send it up?

478
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:16,134
No, please leave me alone!

479
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:17,556
What are you looking for?

480
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:21,396
Madame wants some
wine for mass.

481
00:43:22,301 --> 00:43:24,792
It's ready.
You only had to ask.

482
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:36,605
You bastard!

483
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:39,416
You're the house informer,
are you?

484
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:41,981
Nothing disgusts me more!

485
00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:44,145
I've worked here 15 years.

486
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:50,287
I've got their trust.

487
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:53,863
And that's more important to me
than anything else.

488
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,859
You can't understand.
I have my reasons.

489
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,598
So I take the blame!

490
00:44:04,176 --> 00:44:05,803
Want to know something?

491
00:44:06,779 --> 00:44:07,609
Go ahead.

492
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:10,604
You're old and ugly,
and you make me sick!

493
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:15,546
And you're one hell of a
beautiful girl.

494
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:21,951
The wine!

495
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:37,031
And you're obedient, too.
I like that.

496
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:58,757
See you tonight, Monsieur.

497
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:33,096
That's for you, Father.

498
00:45:36,335 --> 00:45:37,734
Good,
I was just about out.

499
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:42,570
Have some cake, too.
With orange blossom water.

500
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:44,469
You're spoiling me.
You're too kind.

501
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:47,109
I saw Mr. Monteil as I arrived.

502
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:48,472
He's getting some exercise.

503
00:45:48,614 --> 00:45:51,048
He needs to work off his energy.

504
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:54,818
- Mr. Monteil is a very vigorous man.
- Yes, unfortunately!

505
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,754
Why "unfortunately"?

506
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,580
Come sit down, Father.

507
00:46:00,726 --> 00:46:03,251
He has a strong constitution,
you understand?

508
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,760
This is hard to say...

509
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:11,002
You can speak to me.
I'm not only your confessor but your friend.

510
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:13,398
It's true, you have my
complete trust.

511
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:16,235
Please have a seat.

512
00:46:20,913 --> 00:46:24,849
My husband is demanding.
He's very strong and active.

513
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,480
But I'm unable to satisfy his needs.

514
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,854
I can't.
Really I can't!

515
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,223
It's too painful for me.

516
00:46:35,394 --> 00:46:39,888
If I understand you,
I don't see what I can do for you.

517
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:41,191
Advise me.

518
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:43,262
But how?
What can I say?

519
00:46:43,702 --> 00:46:46,364
I don't really know.
At times, it's so hard.

520
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:52,676
I mean,
perhaps there are other ways...

521
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:55,211
Relations that more...
less...

522
00:46:56,715 --> 00:46:58,376
Certain caresses that...

523
00:47:00,886 --> 00:47:04,788
Be more precise.
There are caresses... and caresses!

524
00:47:06,058 --> 00:47:07,491
How frequent?

525
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:11,023
My husband's so robust.

526
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:14,031
Twice a week, perhaps.

527
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:17,166
Twice a week!
That's too much, much too much!

528
00:47:18,137 --> 00:47:21,573
No matter how robust he is
it's not twice a week that he needs...

529
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:25,174
In any case,
I'll say this much:

530
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:28,308
You mustn't derive any pleasure!

531
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:31,616
On that point, Father,
you can set your mind at rest.

532
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:37,752
Well, Madame, do you know
our church roof is damaged?

533
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,181
It must be repaired before
winter comes.

534
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,228
Madame,
can you come upstairs?

535
00:47:46,465 --> 00:47:48,057
What is it, Celestine?

536
00:47:48,801 --> 00:47:49,927
It's Mr. Rabour!

537
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,804
- My father...
- Please!

538
00:47:59,645 --> 00:48:02,944
Monsieur, come out!

539
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:12,284
I wanted to do his room but
he doesn't answer.

540
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:15,491
- You sure he's there?
- The door's locked on the inside.

541
00:48:16,495 --> 00:48:18,326
- And through the office?
- Locked, too.

542
00:48:24,937 --> 00:48:25,961
Father!

543
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:33,566
You were with him an hour ago.
Was anything wrong?

544
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:36,370
No, he was as normal
as he usually is.

545
00:48:36,615 --> 00:48:37,673
What's wrong?

546
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:39,916
I don't know.
Maybe he had an attack.

547
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:41,049
It's locked?

548
00:48:42,054 --> 00:48:43,521
Then I'll force the door.

549
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:46,081
Joseph can open it
without much damage.

550
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:48,416
But he's out delivering
the wine kegs.

551
00:48:48,861 --> 00:48:51,125
You mustn't panic.
Let Mr. Monteil do it.

552
00:48:51,463 --> 00:48:52,487
Come this way.

553
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:07,744
Goddamn!

554
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,545
We should get a locksmith.

555
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:15,318
No time!

556
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:19,549
- May I, Father?
- Go ahead, child.

557
00:50:38,337 --> 00:50:39,361
Hello, Joseph!

558
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,973
Roaming around the woods again?

559
00:50:43,642 --> 00:50:45,576
Look, snails!
Want them?

560
00:50:47,746 --> 00:50:48,610
No, thanks.

561
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:50,545
Some blackberries?

562
00:50:51,183 --> 00:50:52,650
I'll take you back.

563
00:50:53,452 --> 00:50:54,851
No, I'm not finished.

564
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,545
Too bad!
I'm going.

565
00:51:03,195 --> 00:51:04,423
Watch out for wolves!

566
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,534
40,000 francs
in inheritance taxes!

567
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:27,570
I haven't won a game today.

568
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:30,845
And 352 francs
for the funeral.

569
00:52:34,953 --> 00:52:36,477
Come in, Celestine.

570
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:39,723
So you're really leaving us?

571
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,560
Going back to Paris?

572
00:52:44,096 --> 00:52:45,757
For now, yes.

573
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:50,565
A pity. I'd become used to you and
my poor father was fond of you.

574
00:52:52,237 --> 00:52:54,569
I was pleased with your behavior.

575
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,406
If you ever want to come back,
just write to me.

576
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:00,904
Thank you, Madame.

577
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,669
Farewell.

578
00:53:32,744 --> 00:53:34,803
- Hello, Adolph!
- How are you?

579
00:53:35,847 --> 00:53:37,644
- Got a minute?
- Why?

580
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,917
- We wanna talk to you.
- What about?

581
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:43,588
So, Francois,
found that little girl yet?

582
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,584
- We found her.
- Good!

583
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:48,121
We found her but
she was dead.

584
00:53:50,462 --> 00:53:51,554
What's that?

585
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,324
What did she die of?

586
00:53:53,932 --> 00:53:56,332
- Murdered.
- Worse still, she was raped.

587
00:53:56,868 --> 00:54:00,167
- Lf you'd seen what we just saw!
- Horrible!

588
00:54:00,772 --> 00:54:02,740
You talking about Claire?

589
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:04,998
When did it happen?

590
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:09,708
The coroner says 6 days ago,
in other words, last Saturday.

591
00:54:10,148 --> 00:54:12,582
The day your employer died!

592
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:15,511
- Where'd they find her?
- In the Raillon Woods.

593
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:19,183
So we'd like to know

594
00:54:19,324 --> 00:54:22,293
if you noticed anything that day.

595
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:33,898
Hey, Rose!
Gossiping again?

596
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,306
- Any letters?
- Two, Captain.

597
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:39,273
I bet the bastard's still around.

598
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:40,875
He's not that dumb!

599
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:43,443
Nobody here
could do such a thing.

600
00:54:43,715 --> 00:54:46,513
If her aunt had raised her right,
she'd be alive now.

601
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:49,079
She's too poor for 'em
to find her killer.

602
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:52,650
Hey, you, don't you get snide
about French justice!

603
00:54:53,992 --> 00:54:55,482
So, Celestine,
missed your train?

604
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:57,552
So stay a minute!

605
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:06,135
- You staying?
- I changed my mind.

606
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:07,832
That's great!

607
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,163
Heard the news?

608
00:55:10,108 --> 00:55:12,975
I hear her belly was split open
with a knife.

609
00:55:13,211 --> 00:55:15,406
Yeah, so Pantois said.
He found her.

610
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,006
She was butchered.

611
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,983
Why'd she always go into
the woods alone?

612
00:55:20,452 --> 00:55:21,885
Who could've done it?

613
00:55:22,654 --> 00:55:23,916
And rape her, too!

614
00:55:24,222 --> 00:55:27,783
I say it was those 2 monks
who came through here last week.

615
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:31,454
They were begging.
Pretty unorthodox!

616
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:34,564
Monks? You can't mean it!
Such holy souls!

617
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,426
Wanna know what I think?

618
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:39,436
I'm not sure of this,

619
00:55:39,938 --> 00:55:42,907
but remember the Jesureau girl last year!
She almost got it!

620
00:55:44,476 --> 00:55:47,274
If I was a policeman,
I'd check next door.

621
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:49,506
You mean Mr. Monteil?

622
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:52,475
Good Lord,
he'd be too scared!

623
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:54,013
That don't hold water.

624
00:55:55,987 --> 00:55:57,011
What do you think?

625
00:55:58,256 --> 00:55:59,188
Nothing.

626
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:01,950
All I know is I was very fond
of that girl.

627
00:56:02,894 --> 00:56:04,521
So sweet and innocent!

628
00:56:06,665 --> 00:56:08,565
If I could get my hands
on her killer!

629
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:12,127
See you soon.

630
00:56:15,974 --> 00:56:18,704
I gotta continue my rounds.
So long!

631
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:21,871
Where does she get the money
to dress like that?

632
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:08,853
Madame doesn't understand
why you came back.

633
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:11,152
- Why did you?
- Because!

634
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:46,322
You did right to come back.
That was nice of you.

635
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:51,195
Let me do that for you.

636
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,472
I like 'em that way too.

637
00:57:58,243 --> 00:58:00,711
You never really know people
when you meet 'em.

638
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:04,010
Women especially are hell
to get to know.

639
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:08,619
But now I know you well.

640
00:58:10,288 --> 00:58:11,312
You know me?

641
00:58:12,891 --> 00:58:14,153
Then tell me what I am.

642
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,048
What you are?

643
00:58:18,096 --> 00:58:19,256
You're like me.

644
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:21,762
Like you?

645
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,603
I don't mean in looks.
I'm old and ugly.

646
00:58:28,373 --> 00:58:29,931
But deep down inside,
we're alike.

647
00:58:31,443 --> 00:58:32,705
I know what I'm talking about.

648
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:48,784
The boss died on a Saturday,
right?

649
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:50,761
I think so.

650
00:58:52,831 --> 00:58:55,095
The day you delivered
the wine kegs?

651
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,002
Could be.

652
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:02,830
It was the day little Claire died.

653
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:07,776
- Did you go through the Raillon Woods?
- Sure.

654
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:10,403
It's the shortest way.

655
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,718
You didn't happen to see Claire?

656
00:59:17,689 --> 00:59:19,179
You damn women!

657
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:23,857
You ought to think about
other things.

658
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:36,302
But think what you will,
you and I are alike.

659
00:59:37,175 --> 00:59:38,608
Our souls are alike.

660
01:00:28,393 --> 01:00:30,088
Ah, the flowers...
Thank you.

661
01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:38,733
Look!

662
01:00:40,538 --> 01:00:41,232
You see?

663
01:00:45,543 --> 01:00:46,373
Don't!

664
01:00:46,511 --> 01:00:48,638
This time I'll break his neck.

665
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:50,278
But we're in mourning!

666
01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:52,506
- So what?
- Get in!

667
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:19,074
Say, Rose.

668
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:22,778
- I gave you how much yesterday?
- 25 francs.

669
01:01:24,649 --> 01:01:26,674
- I'm 38 cents short.
- I didn't take 'em!

670
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:27,842
No, the cat did!

671
01:01:44,902 --> 01:01:47,598
This is an unexpected visit.
What brings you here?

672
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:48,999
I have errands to do.

673
01:01:49,641 --> 01:01:52,235
- Haven't you gone too far?
- Me?

674
01:01:52,777 --> 01:01:54,938
Yesterday
you threw more trash over.

675
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:58,242
You just missed
hitting my employer.

676
01:01:58,516 --> 01:02:00,507
I won't use kid-gloves
with that bastard!

677
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:03,949
- Won't you come in a moment?
- I have my errands.

678
01:02:04,656 --> 01:02:07,124
So the cobbler
kicked the bucket!

679
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:09,593
- Who?
- The old man.

680
01:02:10,128 --> 01:02:12,153
- You've no right to talk like that.
- Why shouldn't I?

681
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,164
- Know what you ought to do?
- What?

682
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:20,565
File a suit against Monteil.

683
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:23,231
- A suit?
- You bet. Hit him hard!

684
01:02:23,541 --> 01:02:26,066
- Indecent conduct!
- But there's no reason!

685
01:02:26,477 --> 01:02:28,206
What difference does it make?

686
01:02:28,713 --> 01:02:31,546
- I can't do that!
- But it's easy as pie.

687
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:34,950
You go to the police
and Rose and I act as witnesses.

688
01:02:35,353 --> 01:02:37,844
We'll swear we saw everything.

689
01:02:38,022 --> 01:02:40,252
- What did you see?
- Don't worry.

690
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:44,126
A soldier's word means something,
especially nowadays.

691
01:02:45,396 --> 01:02:48,991
And it'll be easy to tack on
that rape business.

692
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:52,630
- Little Claire!
- You're not being serious.

693
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:56,265
I'm just saying what I'd do
in your shoes.

694
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:06,138
One more thing...

695
01:03:06,918 --> 01:03:09,318
When Rose is out,
come by and see me.

696
01:03:10,421 --> 01:03:13,015
- Just a thought, too.
- What an idea!

697
01:03:13,491 --> 01:03:14,651
You must come.

698
01:03:16,494 --> 01:03:17,426
Promise?

699
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:40,216
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

700
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:47,188
I agreed to answer this summons,

701
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:51,126
but first I want to know if
the gentleman has witnesses.

702
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:53,060
Witnesses?

703
01:03:54,932 --> 01:03:57,594
The crap he throws all day
is my witness!

704
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,135
What do you say,
Captain?

705
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:05,434
On my word as a soldier,
I threw nothing on his property.

706
01:04:06,811 --> 01:04:07,743
Nothing?

707
01:04:10,782 --> 01:04:11,874
That's a bit much!

708
01:04:12,617 --> 01:04:14,517
He never stops,
morning to night!

709
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:16,613
Everyone know it's his stuff.

710
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:18,112
You held on to it?

711
01:04:18,623 --> 01:04:20,682
Why hold on to old hats?
I burned them.

712
01:04:21,492 --> 01:04:22,754
Well?

713
01:04:24,128 --> 01:04:27,120
Everyone knows he cuts my trees!
He lays traps for my cats!

714
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:29,665
And he lies through his teeth.

715
01:04:30,468 --> 01:04:32,197
- You calling me a liar?
- And how!

716
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,594
You hooligan!

717
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:34,869
Hear that?

718
01:04:35,206 --> 01:04:36,605
Keep calm.

719
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:41,074
Mr. Monteil,
it's most unlikely that a valiant soldier,

720
01:04:41,212 --> 01:04:44,375
an officer who won his stripes
on the battlefield,

721
01:04:44,515 --> 01:04:47,450
would toss hats into your garden,
like a schoolboy.

722
01:04:47,785 --> 01:04:49,252
He's insulted the Army!

723
01:04:49,587 --> 01:04:51,214
Let's keep calm.

724
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:53,857
And you've brought no proof.

725
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:55,249
You scoundrel!

726
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:57,258
Upstart!
Shirker!

727
01:04:57,528 --> 01:05:00,190
I served in the war!

728
01:05:00,765 --> 01:05:02,995
- At the Invalides!
- So? Is that a disgrace?

729
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:05,235
Enough, gentlemen!

730
01:05:16,147 --> 01:05:18,342
- Miss Rose!
- Hello, Father!

731
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:20,744
- How's the captain?
- As hardy as ever!

732
01:05:25,857 --> 01:05:26,824
What?

733
01:05:27,258 --> 01:05:31,592
I hope we'll have nice flowers for
the altar at Corpus Christi.

734
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:33,320
Certainly, Father!

735
01:05:33,831 --> 01:05:35,059
Respects to the Captain!

736
01:05:47,578 --> 01:05:48,772
How did it go?

737
01:05:49,146 --> 01:05:52,946
Tonight you'll cook us a rabbit
in white wine.

738
01:05:54,185 --> 01:05:55,652
Lord, what a child!

739
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,467
Come with me.

740
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,942
Me?

741
01:06:35,393 --> 01:06:36,724
Where are we going?

742
01:06:55,346 --> 01:06:58,213
It smells of cows.
But it's so orderly here.

743
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:00,547
More orderly than you think!

744
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:08,950
Give me a hand.
I'm not much good at mending.

745
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,020
- Why ask me?
- I'd rather you did it.

746
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:14,196
Everything's on the table.

747
01:07:14,532 --> 01:07:16,261
I'm not your servant!

748
01:07:16,634 --> 01:07:18,192
If you don't want to, tough!

749
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:28,645
Next time you snoop
through my things,

750
01:07:29,447 --> 01:07:30,812
leave them the way you find them.

751
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:35,546
These match boxes were like this.

752
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:39,654
What were you looking for?

753
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,621
And I see you went through
my chest.

754
01:07:46,864 --> 01:07:48,559
You've got a lot of nerve!

755
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:52,162
Got some bad ideas about me?

756
01:07:54,772 --> 01:07:58,333
Snoop through everything!
My underclothes, my closet!

757
01:07:58,776 --> 01:08:01,643
Even in here!
You won't find a thing!

758
01:08:01,879 --> 01:08:03,312
- Think so?
- You bet!

759
01:08:04,949 --> 01:08:06,177
Now listen...

760
01:08:07,585 --> 01:08:09,985
I think it was you
who killed little Claire.

761
01:08:13,891 --> 01:08:16,155
See?
It's like I said.

762
01:08:16,861 --> 01:08:18,260
You've got bad ideas
about me.

763
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:22,527
I know what goes on in your mind.
Your every thought!

764
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:25,893
- You scare me.
- Why?

765
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,731
I think you're a crook.

766
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:31,640
A crook, me?
Are you serious?

767
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:34,368
Look around!
I love the army!

768
01:08:34,678 --> 01:08:36,077
Religion!
Law and order!

769
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,808
My country,
above all!

770
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:44,479
Look at me.
Am I lying when I say I love all that?

771
01:08:45,756 --> 01:08:47,223
No, you're not lying.

772
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:49,189
Would a crook love all that?

773
01:08:50,528 --> 01:08:53,429
Come now,
admit you killed Claire.

774
01:08:55,099 --> 01:08:56,327
This has nothing
to do with Claire.

775
01:08:59,437 --> 01:09:00,927
It has to do with
you and me now.

776
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:03,228
I dream about you.

777
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,839
You set my blood on fire,
my dear Celestine.

778
01:09:07,545 --> 01:09:09,342
For me,
there's no one but you.

779
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,753
We have to
get together right away.

780
01:09:25,429 --> 01:09:26,623
We can't just now.

781
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:28,095
Why not?

782
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:31,961
I told you already...

783
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,161
- We have to wait a bit.
- What for?

784
01:09:35,773 --> 01:09:36,865
Wait a bit.

785
01:09:37,942 --> 01:09:39,466
If it was only
to have a little fun,

786
01:09:40,144 --> 01:09:42,112
then why not.
But this is serious.

787
01:09:42,913 --> 01:09:44,312
I want you for keeps.

788
01:10:18,449 --> 01:10:19,507
'Night, Monsieur.

789
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:46,069
Come in.

790
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:57,585
What do you want?

791
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,548
- Look, dear...
- Leave me alone!

Yes, he is.

Yes, it's important.

01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,119
"and in certain cases...

811
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,227
"the immediate removal of
the vehicle."

812
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:56,293
I'm in a hurry today.
I'll come again.

813
01:14:02,339 --> 01:14:04,034
Too bad!

814
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:18,151
Good to see you.
I need to talk to you.

815
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:20,419
How are you?

816
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:23,318
- How about a coffee?
- No, I'm in a hurry.

817
01:14:23,594 --> 01:14:24,856
I'll walk with you.

818
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:27,889
- How's Rose?
- I threw her out.

819
01:14:28,165 --> 01:14:29,564
- What?
- Exactly.

820
01:14:29,933 --> 01:14:32,060
But she's been with you
for 10 years!

821
01:14:33,137 --> 01:14:34,365
12 years!

822
01:14:34,605 --> 01:14:35,799
Such a good woman!

823
01:14:36,373 --> 01:14:39,831
She knew your tastes and habits
and was so devoted to you.

824
01:14:40,077 --> 01:14:44,013
Sure. I never had asparagus
because Madame didn't like it!

825
01:14:44,181 --> 01:14:47,241
I'd had enough.
She stopped doing work around the house.

826
01:14:48,285 --> 01:14:51,186
Everything belonged to her.
Like my Voltaire armchair, for instance.

827
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,516
She was always in it.
She took everything.

828
01:14:54,358 --> 01:14:58,351
I had nothing left,
dammit!

829
01:15:01,365 --> 01:15:03,424
And whenever I spoke to you,

830
01:15:04,468 --> 01:15:06,197
I wouldn't hear the last of it.

831
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:08,531
She was jealous.

832
01:15:09,907 --> 01:15:11,340
What'll you do now?

833
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,938
That depends on you.

834
01:15:14,478 --> 01:15:15,467
On me?

835
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:17,980
Yes,
on you alone.

836
01:15:19,016 --> 01:15:19,983
How?

837
01:15:23,253 --> 01:15:26,245
Let's be frank,
like soldiers.

838
01:15:27,257 --> 01:15:29,691
Do you want me
to marry you?

839
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:33,291
- You, marry me?
- Why not?

840
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:37,000
I know I'm older.
How old are you?

841
01:15:37,234 --> 01:15:38,360
- 32.
- So?

842
01:15:40,237 --> 01:15:43,468
- I can't cook very well.
- We'll hire a cook.

843
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:46,974
Besides, there's cooking
and cooking.

844
01:15:47,511 --> 01:15:49,706
That's not what I need from you.

845
01:15:49,847 --> 01:15:50,745
So what do you say?

846
01:15:51,515 --> 01:15:54,143
I don't know.
Let me think it over.

847
01:15:55,085 --> 01:15:57,246
Right.
Think it over.

848
01:15:58,222 --> 01:15:59,314
But quick!

849
01:16:11,835 --> 01:16:12,893
What time is it?

850
01:16:14,538 --> 01:16:15,505
Can't you see?

851
01:16:16,507 --> 01:16:17,838
Pass the wine, please.

852
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:20,107
You drink too much,
I told you.

853
01:16:32,656 --> 01:16:36,285
- Celestine's not here?
- She's in bed with a headache.

854
01:16:46,904 --> 01:16:47,871
That will do.

855
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:54,299
I told you I hate herb tea
in the evening.

856
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,671
What you're doing's not right.
I mean it.

857
01:18:10,787 --> 01:18:11,719
Like I told you,

858
01:18:12,556 --> 01:18:13,955
if it's just to have some fun,

859
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:17,123
sure, right away.
I wouldn't hesitate.

860
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:19,019
I've known women,

861
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:21,428
but it's not the same with you.

862
01:18:22,232 --> 01:18:23,927
- I got plans for you.
- What plans?

863
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:25,427
- Plans.
- What kind?

864
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:29,899
I'd like you to be my wife.

865
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,837
Me,
your wife?

866
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:35,536
I've thought it out.
That's why I'm waiting for the priest to come.

867
01:18:39,082 --> 01:18:40,811
I've found a good deal for us:

868
01:18:41,518 --> 01:18:44,385
A cafe, for sale back home
in Cherbourg.

869
01:18:44,521 --> 01:18:46,148
It's a military town.

870
01:18:46,623 --> 01:18:49,888
Business is good.
I guarantee you we can make a mint.

871
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,858
With a wife like you,
sweet

872
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:54,725
and cute!
Would you like to?

873
01:18:55,265 --> 01:18:56,664
Me?
But...

874
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,195
You're the kind I need,
a woman of order.

875
01:18:59,603 --> 01:19:02,003
Plus you're nice and not bashful.

876
01:19:04,141 --> 01:19:06,974
You'll have every garrison
at your feet.

877
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:09,408
You want me to be a whore
for you?

878
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:13,814
Don't look at it that way.
It's a terrific opportunity.

879
01:19:14,785 --> 01:19:18,516
I'm telling you now but it won't happen
for another 4 or 6 months.

880
01:19:18,889 --> 01:19:21,380
- Why not now?
- Because we gotta wait.

881
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:25,918
The cafe,
needs a paint job.

882
01:19:27,531 --> 01:19:30,295
We could call it
"At the French Army."

883
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:32,366
Got the money?

884
01:19:33,336 --> 01:19:36,430
Some.
But not here.

885
01:19:37,808 --> 01:19:40,971
I don't know just how much.
But "money begets money."

886
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:43,944
And sometimes,
politics pays.

887
01:19:44,915 --> 01:19:48,009
And there's something else,
very important.

888
01:19:48,485 --> 01:19:49,509
I'll tell you another time.

889
01:19:51,722 --> 01:19:52,950
I gotta have that cafe.

890
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:56,485
Revolution's around the corner.

891
01:19:57,394 --> 01:19:59,021
There's nothing better for a cafe!

892
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,078
If I say yes to the cafe...

893
01:20:16,613 --> 01:20:18,080
Would you want to now?

894
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:22,575
I'm stubborn.
What I say once, I mean for keeps.

895
01:20:23,386 --> 01:20:24,410
I know!

896
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:26,183
I've heard it often enough.

897
01:20:26,757 --> 01:20:29,487
I'm fed up with you
and everybody here!

898
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:31,418
I'm leaving,
and right away!

899
01:20:32,262 --> 01:20:34,162
Find someone else for your cafe.

900
01:20:34,598 --> 01:20:36,088
There's no one but you.

901
01:20:36,533 --> 01:20:39,366
Even if you got bad ideas on me,
I'm sure of that.

902
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:42,338
Listen good!

903
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:46,437
If you swear...
on this...

904
01:20:47,544 --> 01:20:50,240
that you'll be my wife,
then OK.

905
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:54,707
You swear?

906
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:01,155
Good.

907
01:21:28,251 --> 01:21:30,242
And now,
my dear Joseph,

908
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,318
tell me you killed little Claire.

909
01:21:34,257 --> 01:21:35,383
Shut up!

910
01:21:57,247 --> 01:21:59,647
You should go hunting
and let me work in peace.

911
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:02,641
- I'd like to.
- Well then?

912
01:22:03,954 --> 01:22:05,114
I'm out of cartridges.

913
01:22:06,556 --> 01:22:09,457
- I need to buy some but...
- I gave you 15 francs Monday.

914
01:22:10,694 --> 01:22:12,491
- All gone.
- Too bad!

915
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:46,762
Come with me.

916
01:22:59,943 --> 01:23:02,605
What's all this?

917
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:08,214
Celestine and I
are going to be married.

918
01:23:09,152 --> 01:23:10,710
You're marrying Celestine?

919
01:23:11,888 --> 01:23:12,946
Is this serious?

920
01:23:14,324 --> 01:23:16,224
How nice!
But your service?

921
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:18,785
Madame needn't worry,
it's not for a while.

922
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:22,327
Not for a few months yet,
till you find replacements.

923
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:23,958
For whatever time it takes.

924
01:23:24,534 --> 01:23:27,697
We'll miss you, Joseph.
You too, Celestine.

925
01:23:28,738 --> 01:23:30,672
I hope you'll both be happy.

926
01:23:39,916 --> 01:23:42,180
We may move to Cherbourg.

927
01:23:42,886 --> 01:23:44,717
I'm interested in a business there.

928
01:23:45,455 --> 01:23:47,047
I'll take the dog out.

929
01:23:47,924 --> 01:23:50,722
We should have an engagement party
one of these days.

930
01:23:51,628 --> 01:23:55,496
While you're here,
help me move this table.

931
01:23:55,832 --> 01:23:57,493
Take the vase,
Celestine.

932
01:23:58,234 --> 01:23:59,792
Move that.

933
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:05,002
Careful,
it's very heavy.

934
01:24:08,011 --> 01:24:09,069
Watch the rug!

935
01:24:29,466 --> 01:24:30,899
So, Marianne,
laundry all right?

936
01:24:36,473 --> 01:24:38,236
Bet you were up to mischief
as a girl!

937
01:24:38,942 --> 01:24:40,967
Me, Monsieur?
Mischief?

938
01:24:41,778 --> 01:24:43,473
I've worked all my life.

939
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,247
You're a woman like all women.

940
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:47,644
I like to have fun, too.

941
01:24:52,055 --> 01:24:53,044
I'm all for love.

942
01:24:54,357 --> 01:24:55,756
Amour fou

943
01:24:58,728 --> 01:24:59,922
I mean it, Marianne.

944
01:25:01,765 --> 01:25:03,255
You've been on my mind
a long time.

945
01:25:04,901 --> 01:25:06,061
I've been watching you.

946
01:25:09,406 --> 01:25:12,864
Say I come to your room tonight.

947
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:17,668
What d'you say?

948
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:20,913
Around 10?

949
01:25:22,919 --> 01:25:24,113
You little minx, you!

950
01:25:46,643 --> 01:25:47,439
Come here.

951
01:25:52,348 --> 01:25:53,110
What, Monsieur?

952
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:56,075
Get in there!

953
01:27:17,834 --> 01:27:19,392
Quiet, Bobby!

954
01:27:29,312 --> 01:27:31,371
- Who is it?
- Just the sexton.

955
01:27:32,549 --> 01:27:33,573
Come in.

956
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:43,658
Don't mind her.
We can talk.

957
01:27:43,793 --> 01:27:44,589
Have a seat.

958
01:27:49,699 --> 01:27:52,930
- The rally still set for Sunday?
- Still.

959
01:27:53,503 --> 01:27:56,063
If we leave here at 4 a.m.
We can be there by 9.

960
01:27:56,573 --> 01:27:58,268
This time their ears'll whistle!

961
01:27:59,175 --> 01:28:03,236
I made myself this.

962
01:28:03,513 --> 01:28:05,572
- Taking it?
- Sure! Got the leaflets?

963
01:28:05,815 --> 01:28:07,783
Yes.
Here...

964
01:28:08,251 --> 01:28:09,684
- How many?
- 250.

965
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,518
We each take half.

966
01:28:12,589 --> 01:28:16,548
We'll hand 'em out to the republicans too
even if they throw us out.

967
01:28:22,765 --> 01:28:24,426
- The police!
- What do they want?

968
01:28:25,635 --> 01:28:26,761
Who knows?

969
01:28:43,686 --> 01:28:46,655
Sit here.

970
01:28:53,596 --> 01:28:56,429
'Evening, Sergeant.
What brings you here?

971
01:28:57,066 --> 01:29:01,127
We were passing by and figured,
"Joseph might offer us a drink!"

972
01:29:01,671 --> 01:29:05,129
- To warm us up!
- I got just the thing here.

973
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:07,372
Nights are chilly now.

974
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:10,902
We're OK in the sun,
but at dusk it starts to freeze.

975
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:13,038
That's how you catch a cold!

976
01:29:13,983 --> 01:29:17,077
Nice place you got here.
Spotless!

977
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:21,252
If your room was this neat,

978
01:29:21,391 --> 01:29:23,518
you'd find your belt quicker
in the morning!

979
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:26,928
Cheers!

980
01:29:29,432 --> 01:29:31,366
- Cheers!
- To your health!

981
01:29:31,934 --> 01:29:33,424
Your health,
mam'zelle!

982
01:29:34,437 --> 01:29:35,597
Thanks.

983
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:40,741
- A refill?
- No, we gotta go.

984
01:29:41,911 --> 01:29:46,507
Too bad! It's nice and warm here.
But duty calls!

985
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:48,650
C'mon,
one for the road!

986
01:29:48,851 --> 01:29:50,318
A quick one, then!

987
01:29:51,587 --> 01:29:53,418
By the way,

988
01:29:53,556 --> 01:29:56,354
the poachers are back
in the region.

989
01:29:57,193 --> 01:30:01,027
If you spot any,
give us a call.

990
01:30:01,264 --> 01:30:02,288
Right.

991
01:30:02,999 --> 01:30:04,967
And while I think of it...

992
01:30:05,702 --> 01:30:07,260
remember the day
Mr. Rabour died?

993
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:12,636
Did you go through Raillon Woods
that day?

994
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:16,170
Maybe.
I'm often in it.

995
01:30:16,979 --> 01:30:18,412
And little Claire?

996
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:23,109
Did you see her 2 or 3 days before
we found her?

997
01:30:23,553 --> 01:30:25,783
If I did,
I'd have told you.

998
01:30:30,526 --> 01:30:32,994
This piece of metal
mean anything to you?

999
01:30:34,163 --> 01:30:36,222
It's from a shoe.
Let me see.

1000
01:30:36,966 --> 01:30:39,264
Everybody wears 'em.
So do I.

1001
01:30:39,535 --> 01:30:41,196
On all your shoes?

1002
01:30:48,745 --> 01:30:50,872
I lost one.

1003
01:30:52,715 --> 01:30:54,910
- It's mine!
- Yours?

1004
01:30:55,351 --> 01:30:56,545
Looks like it.

1005
01:30:58,254 --> 01:31:00,848
We found it in the grass
this morning,

1006
01:31:01,491 --> 01:31:04,358
right where the girl was killed.
Remember?

1007
01:31:05,895 --> 01:31:07,021
Well, well...

1008
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:08,725
You're coming with us.

1009
01:31:13,336 --> 01:31:16,703
Bad luck, Celestine.
I didn't wear those shoes that day.

1010
01:31:17,206 --> 01:31:18,298
Take him away.

1011
01:31:20,009 --> 01:31:22,603
- You, too!
- It's nothing to do with me!

1012
01:32:09,792 --> 01:32:10,952
Bastard.

1013
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,214
Nobody move!

1014
01:33:32,508 --> 01:33:35,568
Captain, I'm late.
Please excuse my wife.

1015
01:33:35,711 --> 01:33:37,838
She suddenly felt ill.
I had to stay.

1016
01:33:38,514 --> 01:33:40,414
- Nothing serious?
- No, I doubt it.

1017
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:42,677
- You'll join us?
- Of course!

1018
01:33:43,419 --> 01:33:45,182
Then kiss the bride.

1019
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:50,490
This way!

1020
01:34:08,911 --> 01:34:10,208
Wait for me in the stables.

1021
01:34:10,646 --> 01:34:12,773
You start on the seedlings.

1022
01:34:25,928 --> 01:34:27,793
Marianne, what are you doing?
You mad?

1023
01:34:28,297 --> 01:34:29,662
I'm watering,
Monsieur.

1024
01:34:30,533 --> 01:34:31,795
Go clean my boots.

1025
01:34:39,342 --> 01:34:40,536
It's not warm this morning.

1026
01:34:41,243 --> 01:34:43,370
- What time is it?
- Around 9.

1027
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,570
Pass me a towel.

1028
01:34:47,416 --> 01:34:49,611
No,
the one on the stand.

1029
01:34:56,692 --> 01:34:59,490
- You look sad. Something wrong?
- No, I'm fine.

1030
01:35:01,097 --> 01:35:03,088
Take the tray away.

1031
01:35:04,233 --> 01:35:05,564
I have some good news for you.

1032
01:35:06,369 --> 01:35:08,394
I did my will long ago,
but it was a mistake.

1033
01:35:09,105 --> 01:35:10,629
I left everything
to the French Academy.

1034
01:35:11,207 --> 01:35:12,606
Idiotic!

1035
01:35:13,376 --> 01:35:16,368
I drew up a new one yesterday.
Wait and see!

1036
01:35:19,982 --> 01:35:22,246
I'm going hunting with Monteil
tomorrow.

1037
01:35:22,785 --> 01:35:24,719
I must admit,
he's a decent fellow!

1038
01:35:26,288 --> 01:35:27,721
Not at all like his wife.

1039
01:35:28,624 --> 01:35:30,524
A goddamn cow!

1040
01:35:31,494 --> 01:35:33,257
And the trial?

1041
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:34,923
Oh, yes.

1042
01:35:37,066 --> 01:35:40,900
I forgot to tell you.
Things'll work out for Joseph.

1043
01:35:41,871 --> 01:35:44,396
There's no real evidence against him.
He'll be released soon.

1044
01:35:45,508 --> 01:35:47,032
He won't even go to trial.

1045
01:35:47,877 --> 01:35:50,573
I'm not surprised, I know Joseph.
A true patriot!

1046
01:35:51,347 --> 01:35:52,405
Don't you think?

1047
01:35:56,652 --> 01:35:58,677
Unless he's a scoundrel.
That's a possibility.

1048
01:36:06,762 --> 01:36:09,788
Down with the foreigners!

1049
01:36:20,643 --> 01:36:24,204
FRANCE FOR THE FRENCH

1050
01:36:29,318 --> 01:36:31,445
A NOOSE FOR HERRIOT!

1051
01:36:32,722 --> 01:36:34,519
DOWN WITH THE REPUBLIC!

1052
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:36,223
AT THE FRENCH ARMY

1053
01:36:44,734 --> 01:36:46,167
I'll come by later!

1054
01:36:47,269 --> 01:36:48,861
- What?
- See you later!

1055
01:36:49,305 --> 01:36:50,294
Right!

1056
01:37:04,887 --> 01:37:08,584
Read "L'Action Francaise"!

1057
01:37:09,391 --> 01:37:12,292
Buy "L'Action Francaise"!

1058
01:37:29,912 --> 01:37:35,908
Long live Chiappe!

1059
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:07,000
