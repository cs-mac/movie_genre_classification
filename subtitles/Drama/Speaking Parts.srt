1
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:13,978
- Hi.

2
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:16,208
I didn't mean to scare you.

3
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:21,221
I brought you some hand towels.

4
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:27,160
They were the last ones.

5
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:30,897
I saved them for you.

6
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:16,807
- How did you like it?

7
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:21,913
- It was okay.

8
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:25,116
- You can keep it overnight.

9
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:27,160
Most people do.

10
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:37,770
It's only partially wound.

11
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,774
Did it bore you?

12
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,243
- No.

13
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:47,780
- Then what's the problem?

14
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,080
- There isn't a problem.

15
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:54,086
- You always bring them back
like this.

16
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:56,656
I mean, I can usually
figure people out.

17
00:12:56,757 --> 00:13:00,386
I try to build up a character profile
watching what customers take out.

18
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:02,394
The thing about you is,

19
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:05,954
There's no consistenc y.

20
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:08,227
I mean, look at these titles.

21
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:14,263
You got horror, drama, comedy.
Even a bit of porn.

22
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,902
And you've taken most of these
out at least... 20 times.

23
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,219
- This is my lover.

24
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:29,221
- Yeah?

25
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:31,257
- He's an actor.

26
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:37,763
That's the list of movies
he's been in.

27
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:46,272
I like to watch his scenes.

28
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:49,741
- So he's your...

29
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:51,743
- he's my lover.

30
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,745
I'm in love.

31
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:55,781
- What about him?

32
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,786
- You don't believe me.

33
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:02,879
- I didn't say that.

34
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,221
- We work at the same place,
a hotel.

35
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:12,197
That's his day job.

36
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,199
- And he does his acting at night?

37
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:16,735
- And days off.
Sometimes he calls in sick.

38
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:18,930
- He sounds dedicated.

39
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,942
- He is.

40
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,750
- But he's just a extra.

41
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,720
- What do you mean?

42
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:38,622
- Well, he may be in these movies
but he doesn't have a speaking part.

43
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,717
He doesn't talk in them.

44
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:43,262
- He's on screen.

45
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:55,035
There is nothing special
about words.

46
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:06,419
- And then, there are those who complain
that you're not vocal enough.

47
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,318
I'm not talking about noises
here or anything crude.

48
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:18,387
It's just that some people
thrive on compliments.

49
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,161
And ultimately, that's what
we're all here to do.

50
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:26,104
Compliment our guests
while they stay with us.

51
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,278
Good.

52
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:34,245
Now, I have a friend
coming in at two.

53
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:38,717
- A good friend?

54
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:41,253
- Oh, I think you'll find
this friend very good.

55
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:45,883
- All right.

56
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,524
- How are things with Lisa?

57
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,967
- Fine.

58
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:57,003
- Is she still bothering you?

59
00:15:59,073 --> 00:16:00,904
- Not really.

60
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:03,442
- I could have her let go.

61
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:05,705
Find some excuse.

62
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:12,218
- It's not worth it.

63
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,962
- It's not difficult to make each
other's lives more complicated, Clara.

64
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:36,592
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That's what you're doing.

65
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:41,798
- They've already started casting.

66
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:44,207
- Nothing's been finalized.

67
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:47,212
You can make any suggestions
you want.

68
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:49,578
We're here to complement
each other's efforts.

69
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:53,642
That's why I sent you up there.
To become more involved, to help.

70
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:55,221
- How?

71
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,483
- Any way you want.

72
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,491
If there's a location you see,

73
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:01,857
If there's someone you want
to audition, feel free.

74
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:04,157
We're all working together on this.

75
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:05,629
Okay?

76
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:13,873
Good.
So, how do you like the hotel?

77
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:15,566
- It's fine.

78
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,735
- Didn't I tell you?

79
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:21,212
It's very special.
So intimate.

80
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,824
- This one gets taken out a lot.

81
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:43,396
- Is it any good?
- I wouldn't be able to tell you.

82
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:45,897
- Why not?
- I never watch these things.

83
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:48,968
- Then how do you know
what to recommend?

84
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:50,696
- Well, I don't.

85
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:53,238
People check out the covers
and take what they want.

86
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:57,743
- Do you like working here?

87
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:06,311
- Not this part.

88
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,888
- What other part is there?

89
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:11,219
- Well, we rent equipment out.

90
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:12,815
- What for?

91
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:14,985
- People want things recorded.

92
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:17,723
Parties, weddings. The usual.

93
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:19,856
And the not-So-Usual.

94
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,959
Sometimes, I do it for them.

95
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:28,039
- Is this how you usually
get auditions?

96
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,609
Slipping your picture
under some stranger's door?

97
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:33,236
- Well, I don't have an agent.

98
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:35,247
- Well then, how did you
get in touch?

99
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:38,580
- I work at the hotel, part-time,
as a consultant.

100
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,846
- What do you do?

101
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:43,218
- I help to book entertainment.

102
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,518
- So how do you know who I am?

103
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,653
- Well, I don't... exactly.

104
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:52,323
I mean, I know
you're involved with movies.

105
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:55,265
I get a list of names of people
in the entertainment field

106
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,769
Who are staying at the hotel.

107
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:00,203
But I don't know exactly
what it is that you do.

108
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:02,241
- I could be a secretary.

109
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:05,977
- Then why would you
be doing this?

110
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,741
- I could think of reasons.

111
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:13,252
Well, I'm not a secretary.

112
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:18,223
- That's good.

113
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:20,725
- So, let's start.

114
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:22,727
I'll read with you.

115
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:24,729
If you could just look
into the camera.

116
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:26,765
- Sure.

117
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:37,537
- How do you know what to film?

118
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:39,373
- You don't.

119
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:42,209
You just go in there with your camera
and get whatever you can.

120
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:49,754
- What's happening here?

121
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:51,756
- Oh. I usually try to find a room

122
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,758
Where I can take people
and get them to talk.

123
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,691
This is the bride's dad.

124
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:58,788
Everyone's having a great time.
- Thank you.

125
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:00,890
- Is she your only daughter?

126
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:06,705
You've enjoyed a lot of applause
in your career.

127
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:10,140
But something extraordinarily
dramatic is happening to you today.

128
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:12,871
Can you give us any indication -

129
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:15,345
And I know this is not
the best time to ask -

130
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:17,917
Of what's going through your mind?

131
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:25,749
This must be a very happy day
for you.

132
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,731
I can honestly say that this is
the best wedding I've ever taped.

133
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,233
- Is that true?

134
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:37,235
- Of course not.

135
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:39,271
You've seen one,
you've seen them all.

136
00:22:41,374 --> 00:22:43,239
- There's nothing to be scared of.

137
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:45,868
You've done this sort
of operation before.

138
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:48,641
- I couldn't forgive myself
if anything happened to you.

139
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:50,649
- Why should anything go wrong?

140
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:52,776
- The doctor said...

141
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:54,786
- there's a risk, that's all.

142
00:22:54,888 --> 00:22:59,052
And it's a risk I have to take.
You're my sister.

143
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,218
I'm not gonna watch you die.

144
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:05,363
Okay?

145
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:07,558
- Yes.

146
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,692
- How was it?

147
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:12,169
- Fine.

148
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:16,207
- Do you want me to read it again?

149
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,209
- All right.

150
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:21,212
- I have a question.
- Yes.

151
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:23,908
- Do I find out that
you're dying in the scene?

152
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:26,144
- What?

153
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:30,246
- Is this the scene where
I find out that you're dying?

154
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:35,156
- No. No.
You've found that out before.

155
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:47,132
- I'd...

156
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,731
do anything in the world
to make her happy.

157
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:52,744
- Well, I think you have.

158
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:54,905
- Thank you.

159
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:57,040
- And now, she's leaving the nest,

160
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,277
About to embark in a new life.

161
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:03,555
And let me tell you,
she'll never forget this.

162
00:24:08,295 --> 00:24:10,695
- That's amazing.

163
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,357
- What?

164
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:16,026
- That you got him to do that.

165
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:19,162
- It's not too difficult.

166
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:21,240
Just got to know
what buttons to push.

167
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:27,570
- You don't have to say a word.

168
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:30,241
It's good to see you.

169
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:36,712
Is that any better?

170
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:38,791
I can try it again.

171
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:40,917
- What do you think of the script?

172
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:45,226
- I like it.
- Really?

173
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:47,232
- Sure. I mean, it's a bit...

174
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:48,733
- yes?

175
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,996
- Well, I had a little difficulty...

176
00:24:51,104 --> 00:24:53,698
- believing it.
- Hmm.

177
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:55,741
- It's all true.

178
00:24:57,811 --> 00:25:00,302
- Please, eddy.
- Look, it's not that eas y.

179
00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:03,177
- I'll just watch.
You don't have to pay me or anything.

180
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:05,683
I'll help you move stuff around.

181
00:25:05,785 --> 00:25:07,980
- But you just said you wanted
to interview people.

182
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:09,988
- If you think I can.

183
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,183
I mean, I'll do whatever
you want me to.

184
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:14,954
- Let me think about it.
- Please?

185
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:17,822
- I don't know if I should ask this,
but do you think I might have a chance?

186
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,200
- It's not up to me.

187
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:25,737
- Would this be your first
speaking part?

188
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,171
- On film? Yeah.

189
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:30,573
I mean, I've done some theatre.

190
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:32,941
Nothing too big.

191
00:25:35,015 --> 00:25:37,415
- So, what do you do?

192
00:25:39,486 --> 00:25:41,613
- Like I said, I work at the hotel.

193
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:43,552
- Part-time?

194
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:45,215
- No.

195
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,793
- Full-time?
- Yeah.

196
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:50,829
- As an entertainment consultant.

197
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:56,768
- I work in housekeeping.

198
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:03,603
- I was cleaning your room
and I saw the script.

199
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,701
- So you took a chance.

200
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:07,712
- Yeah.

201
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:10,248
- Do you do that often?

202
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:17,950
- What?

203
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:20,185
- Take... chances?

204
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:24,627
- Sometimes.

205
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:26,665
- When they're interesting...

206
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,850
- Lance! Lance!

207
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,688
Lance!

208
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:08,199
Lance!

209
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:42,720
- Clara?

210
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,266
Clara!

211
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:27,304
- I wouldn't say everyone.

212
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:30,843
And what time, do you think,
you would be available,

213
00:30:30,944 --> 00:30:33,276
For instance,
from 3 o'clock until...

214
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:35,244
- until 3:40.

215
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:37,782
- You think so?
- Yes. Definitely.

216
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:45,047
- You're very late, Lance.

217
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:47,251
- I'm sorry.

218
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,726
We thought you might have deserted us

219
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:52,195
- I wouldn't do that.

220
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:54,266
- I would like to think

221
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:57,768
That this is an ideal
working environment for you.

222
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,838
- It is.

223
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:01,873
- Good.

224
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:07,238
How did you like my friend in 106?

225
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:11,712
Hmm, the feeling was mutual.

226
00:31:11,818 --> 00:31:14,150
I've circled in another appointment
for this afternoon.

227
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:18,222
- What time?

228
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:21,725
- During your work hours.
Why?

229
00:31:21,828 --> 00:31:23,762
- It's just that...

230
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,361
I might have to leave
a bit early.

231
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:34,599
- I'm sure we can be flexible.

232
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:40,168
My friend was very taken
with you.

233
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:44,148
- All right.

234
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,844
- Do be careful, though.

235
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:48,853
- What do you mean?

236
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:51,788
- This friend was quite smitten.

237
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,192
Remember what I told you
about distance.

238
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:59,231
Cool mind. Cool heart.

239
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:01,232
Very playful body.

240
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:08,969
- This is not an everyday
sort of a situation, Julie.

241
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:11,100
You could be dying.

242
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,145
Besides, your fear isn't justified.

243
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,511
I've talked to the doctor.

244
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:18,208
There's nothing to be scared of.

245
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:20,218
They've done this sort
of operation before.

246
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,289
It's a matter of my feeling to you.

247
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:25,755
You can't expect me
not to react to this

248
00:32:25,992 --> 00:32:27,892
In what would normally
be considered an extreme...

249
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:30,189
- You're sure?
- Yes.

250
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:32,992
- He's what you're looking for?
- Exactly.

251
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:36,296
- You could be dying.
- You find him natural enough?

252
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:40,202
- Besides, your fear isn't justified.

253
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,900
- Well, let's think about it.
We have a few more days.

254
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:44,909
- He's my choice.

255
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:47,241
- And I respect that.

256
00:32:47,347 --> 00:32:49,281
Now, did you get my revisions?

257
00:32:49,382 --> 00:32:51,282
- Yes.

258
00:32:51,384 --> 00:32:54,251
- And how did you feel about them?
- They're unacceptable.

259
00:32:54,354 --> 00:32:56,322
I hate the idea
of putting in a talk show.

260
00:32:56,422 --> 00:32:58,322
It doesn't add anything.

261
00:32:58,424 --> 00:33:00,984
- Well, it's a unique way
of getting the information across.

262
00:33:01,094 --> 00:33:04,552
Nothing is more boring than
people in a doctor's office

263
00:33:04,664 --> 00:33:08,156
Discussing the disease of the week.
- But it cheapens the point.

264
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:09,700
- What point?

265
00:33:09,802 --> 00:33:12,362
This isn't one of
your university lectures, Clara.

266
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:14,372
You're not in a classroom anymore.

267
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:16,374
We're not presenting a thesis.

268
00:33:16,476 --> 00:33:19,843
We're telling a story.
- My story.

269
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:23,712
- Look. This isn't the time to argue.

270
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:25,010
- When is?

271
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:27,177
- When I'm less bus y.

272
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:29,880
- You're never less bus y.

273
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:32,219
- I can't talk like this.

274
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:35,385
- All right. I'll come there.

275
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:44,729
- Hi.

276
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,856
- Where are you going?

277
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:48,866
- I have to go back.

278
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:50,868
- Why?

279
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,097
- Complications.

280
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:55,231
I'm sorry I had to leave
so early this morning.

281
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:57,241
- It's okay.

282
00:34:57,343 --> 00:34:59,243
Are you returning?

283
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:01,176
- I'm not sure.

284
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,010
- Do we stay in touch?

285
00:35:04,116 --> 00:35:06,050
- Over what?

286
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,224
- Us.

287
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:18,195
- We can still see each other.

288
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:22,233
How?

289
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:17,222
- Lance... what's going on?

290
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:26,231
I know how upset you get.

291
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:33,238
You're very special.

292
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:38,743
You can't let other people
make you feel small.

293
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:47,752
Let me love you.

294
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:06,161
- You see, there's a side of me

295
00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:08,740
That sees you all as children.

296
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:10,240
My children.

297
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:13,210
Now, I don't mean that
in a negative way.

298
00:37:15,281 --> 00:37:18,079
I am concerned
about your well-being.

299
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:21,620
And making this as comfortable
a working environment as possible.

300
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:24,690
If you accept this notion,

301
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,781
Then it's not too difficult
to understand

302
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:29,224
Why I would have favourites.

303
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,231
And some children
are naturally more lovable.

304
00:37:38,804 --> 00:37:40,738
Others...

305
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,206
Well, others have to work harder

306
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:45,436
At gaining the attention
they feel they deserve.

307
00:37:49,815 --> 00:37:51,840
Does that answer your question?

308
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,680
- Is Eddy here?

309
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:24,181
- No.

310
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:26,183
- Where is he?

311
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:28,185
- Shooting a party.

312
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:30,221
- Where is the party?

313
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:35,192
- Why?

314
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:37,194
- He wanted me to help him.

315
00:38:37,296 --> 00:38:39,196
- To help him do what?

316
00:38:39,298 --> 00:38:41,232
- Help him tape it.

317
00:39:32,785 --> 00:39:34,685
- Yeah?
- Is Eddy here?

318
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:36,687
- Who?
- Eddy.

319
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:38,723
I think he's taping the party.

320
00:40:12,324 --> 00:40:14,224
- Hello.

321
00:40:14,326 --> 00:40:16,226
- Hi.

322
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:18,228
- How are you?

323
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,922
- Fine.

324
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:25,633
- I hope this isn't
too strange for you.

325
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:27,672
- No.

326
00:40:29,842 --> 00:40:31,742
Did you have a good trip?

327
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:33,243
- Fine.

328
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:35,313
- When did you get in?

329
00:40:35,414 --> 00:40:37,974
- A couple of hours ago.

330
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:42,510
- I missed you.

331
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:45,513
- Really?

332
00:40:45,624 --> 00:40:48,388
- Yeah.

333
00:43:00,292 --> 00:43:02,658
- I watched your audition again today.

334
00:43:05,798 --> 00:43:07,698
- And?

335
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,734
- It's very good.

336
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:21,712
- What are you doing here?

337
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:24,715
- I came to see
if you needed any help.

338
00:43:24,817 --> 00:43:26,751
- No.

339
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:33,223
- Eddy, why are you doing this?

340
00:43:33,325 --> 00:43:35,850
- Because it's part of my job.

341
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,230
- But it...
- Look.

342
00:43:40,332 --> 00:43:42,232
We'll talk about this later.

343
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:45,269
Come by the store tomorrow.
Okay?

344
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:50,590
- Hi there.

345
00:45:50,696 --> 00:45:52,926
- Hello.

346
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:55,226
- How was your day?

347
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:57,529
- All right.

348
00:45:57,636 --> 00:46:00,161
- What happened?

349
00:46:00,272 --> 00:46:02,763
- Not much.

350
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:05,503
How are things in your end?

351
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:09,513
- Not too good.

352
00:46:23,795 --> 00:46:25,660
- Housekeeping.

353
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:31,735
Housekeeping.

354
00:46:44,316 --> 00:46:46,250
Your ordered some extra towels.

355
00:47:03,268 --> 00:47:06,203
I'm just going to leave them
on the counter.

356
00:47:28,794 --> 00:47:31,729
- I'm... not the casting director.

357
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:36,791
- What do you mean?
- I'm the writer.

358
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:43,900
I was told I'd have
input over casting.

359
00:47:44,009 --> 00:47:45,909
That's why I auditioned you.

360
00:47:46,011 --> 00:47:49,139
They liked your audition, by the way.
You might have the part.

361
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:56,049
You won't find out
for a couple of days,

362
00:47:56,154 --> 00:47:58,384
But you could find out sooner,
if you want.

363
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:00,151
- How?

364
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:03,490
- The producer's assistant
is staying in the room next to mine.

365
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:06,587
That's where all the casting
information is kept.

366
00:48:06,698 --> 00:48:09,030
You can sneak in there
tomorrow night.

367
00:48:09,134 --> 00:48:11,261
- Sneak in?

368
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,965
- One of the... producer's friends
is getting married.

369
00:48:15,073 --> 00:48:17,473
Everyone will be at the wedding.

370
00:48:17,576 --> 00:48:19,840
- Are you sure?

371
00:48:19,945 --> 00:48:22,038
- Positive.

372
00:48:22,147 --> 00:48:25,048
When you're inside the room,

373
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,744
I want you to do me a favour.

374
00:48:31,657 --> 00:48:35,753
I want you to find me a copy
of the revised script.

375
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:38,853
It'll be printed on pink paper.
Is that clear?

376
00:48:40,565 --> 00:48:42,465
- Don't you have a copy?

377
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:44,467
- Why would I?

378
00:48:44,569 --> 00:48:46,799
- Well, if you're the writer...

379
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:48,805
What's so funny?

380
00:48:48,907 --> 00:48:51,774
- I'm only the writer.

381
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,161
- Is that clear?

382
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:18,668
- Yes.

383
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,795
- You sure you know what you're doing?

384
00:49:20,906 --> 00:49:22,806
- I just want an interview
with the bride.

385
00:49:22,908 --> 00:49:24,808
That's all. Nothing fancy.

386
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,810
Just get a sense
of her excitement.

387
00:49:26,912 --> 00:49:29,107
Okay?
- Yes.

388
00:49:29,214 --> 00:49:31,774
- I'm trusting you here.
These are very important people.

389
00:49:31,883 --> 00:49:34,078
- How did you get the job?

390
00:49:34,186 --> 00:49:36,711
- I was personally recommended.

391
00:50:16,328 --> 00:50:18,228
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

392
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,628
- Are you related to the bride?

393
00:50:20,732 --> 00:50:23,701
- Not... this time.

394
00:50:56,234 --> 00:50:58,134
- Hello, everyone.

395
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:02,697
I'm... very sorry
I couldn't be there

396
00:51:02,808 --> 00:51:06,608
To share this special evening
with you.

397
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:12,750
That's her.
And that's the groom.

398
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:14,751
- Most of us gathered here tonight

399
00:51:14,853 --> 00:51:17,845
Are in the profession
of making fairy tales.

400
00:51:17,956 --> 00:51:21,858
But sometimes,
these dreams come true.

401
00:51:23,295 --> 00:51:26,264
And that's certainly the case

402
00:51:26,364 --> 00:51:32,200
When two people, as special
as Ronny and Trish, get married.

403
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:13,706
- And then, I saw her in
this little bikini and...

404
00:52:13,812 --> 00:52:15,712
you remember?

405
00:52:17,816 --> 00:52:20,216
- Ron...

406
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:23,719
I'm wondering if it might be possible
to have a few moments...

407
00:52:23,822 --> 00:52:26,222
alone with Trish?

408
00:52:26,324 --> 00:52:28,189
- What for?

409
00:52:28,293 --> 00:52:32,059
- I'd just like
to ask her some questions.

410
00:52:32,163 --> 00:52:34,631
- About me?

411
00:52:38,837 --> 00:52:40,771
- Would that be okay?

412
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,274
- I guess so.

413
00:53:01,626 --> 00:53:04,356
- This is not an everyday
sort of a situation, julie.

414
00:53:04,462 --> 00:53:06,362
You could be dying.

415
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:09,194
Besides, your fear isn't justified.

416
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:11,735
I've talked to the doctor.

417
00:53:16,808 --> 00:53:18,799
There's nothing...
- Congratulations.

418
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:21,037
- They've done this sort
of operation before.

419
00:53:21,146 --> 00:53:23,205
- Are you sure that's what it means?

420
00:53:23,315 --> 00:53:25,715
- Does it say "final choices"
on the tape?

421
00:53:25,817 --> 00:53:27,910
- Yes.

422
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:30,214
- Then that's what they are.

423
00:53:30,322 --> 00:53:32,620
...and it's a risk
I have to take.

424
00:53:32,724 --> 00:53:35,750
You're my sister.
I am not going to watch you die.

425
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:39,763
Okay?
- Yes.

426
00:53:41,499 --> 00:53:43,763
- Did you find a copy of the script?

427
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,932
- Here.

428
00:53:52,177 --> 00:53:53,769
- Turn to page 73.

429
00:54:10,295 --> 00:54:12,229
Read me what it says.

430
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:23,068
- Are you ready?

431
00:54:24,342 --> 00:54:26,708
- I think so.

432
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:29,712
- What do you see in Ronny?

433
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:31,907
- What?

434
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:35,509
- What do you see in Ronny?
When you look at him,

435
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,747
What are you looking at?

436
00:54:43,328 --> 00:54:44,761
- Him.

437
00:54:47,832 --> 00:54:50,164
- Did it come easy?
- What?

438
00:54:50,268 --> 00:54:52,566
- His love?

439
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:56,698
- I'm not quite sure if I get what...

440
00:54:56,808 --> 00:55:00,938
- have there been times where it
didn't seem so... certain?

441
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:04,675
- No. L...

442
00:55:04,783 --> 00:55:07,809
- I mean, these things are
pretty delicate, aren't they?

443
00:55:07,919 --> 00:55:10,615
There is no telling what could happen.

444
00:55:10,722 --> 00:55:12,849
One of you begins to have
second thoughts and...

445
00:55:12,957 --> 00:55:14,857
the whole thing can crumble away.

446
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:16,893
And then what?

447
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:22,031
- Scene 87.
A large television studio.

448
00:55:22,133 --> 00:55:25,193
The audience at the tv talk-back show
are excited about today's program.

449
00:55:25,303 --> 00:55:28,238
The subject is organ transplants.
And as the camera...

450
00:55:32,043 --> 00:55:34,204
what's the matter?

451
00:55:34,312 --> 00:55:36,712
- That's not what I wrote.

452
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:38,749
- What do you mean?

453
00:55:40,819 --> 00:55:42,753
- They've changed my script.

454
00:55:48,326 --> 00:55:50,385
- Can't you complain?

455
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:53,623
- They'll fire me.

456
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,260
- Maybe if you talked to...
- I've been trying to.

457
00:55:58,369 --> 00:56:02,066
That's why I came here.
He won't even see me.

458
00:56:04,342 --> 00:56:07,573
- I'm sorry.
I wish I could do something.

459
00:56:12,283 --> 00:56:14,217
- You can.

460
00:56:18,857 --> 00:56:21,018
- Why would you ask me that?

461
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:23,185
- Why not?

462
00:56:23,294 --> 00:56:25,194
- I don't even know you.

463
00:56:25,296 --> 00:56:27,958
- It's just that this sort
of questions interest me.

464
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:31,194
I mean, love is about...

465
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:34,328
feeling someone else
feeling you, right?

466
00:56:34,439 --> 00:56:37,875
But sometimes,
you can feel someone else

467
00:56:37,976 --> 00:56:40,308
And you can feel them feeling you,

468
00:56:40,411 --> 00:56:42,470
But they may not act that way.

469
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,980
In your case,
it's the other way around.

470
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:47,847
He says that he loves you,
which is great.

471
00:56:47,952 --> 00:56:50,079
But I'm not sure if that matters.

472
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:52,918
The question is,

473
00:56:53,024 --> 00:56:55,219
Do you feel him feeling you

474
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:57,954
The way you feel yourself?

475
00:57:02,734 --> 00:57:05,225
- Why should I even think about it?

476
00:57:05,336 --> 00:57:08,066
- Because years from now,
when you look back at this tape,

477
00:57:08,173 --> 00:57:11,973
Your answer might be really...
interesting.

478
00:57:20,485 --> 00:57:23,215
Hey! Hey, come back!

479
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:30,227
- This script is very important.

480
00:57:32,297 --> 00:57:35,266
- You said before it was based
on a true story.

481
00:57:35,366 --> 00:57:38,233
- It happened to me...

482
00:57:40,805 --> 00:57:43,035
and my brother.

483
00:57:46,311 --> 00:57:48,211
- So what can I do?

484
00:57:51,316 --> 00:57:53,216
- They'll cast you.

485
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:55,752
And... you'll meet the producer.

486
00:57:55,854 --> 00:57:58,721
He won't listen to me;
he might listen to you.

487
00:57:58,823 --> 00:58:01,758
- Why?
- Because you're an actor.

488
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,557
You can suggest things you think
your character might do.

489
00:58:09,267 --> 00:58:11,235
- And if he doesn't listen?

490
00:58:15,273 --> 00:58:17,298
- You can threaten to leave.

491
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:20,172
- But I'm nothing to them, Clara.

492
00:58:20,278 --> 00:58:22,269
- Not until they start shooting.

493
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,507
But then, you're worth a lot.

494
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:26,675
I mean...

495
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:28,945
they can't cut you out.

496
00:58:29,053 --> 00:58:32,181
And they can't start shooting
everything over with someone else.

497
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:35,088
Do you understand?

498
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,360
- I hope you can explain.
Why is my wife in tears?

499
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:44,367
- I'm sorry. I did not talk
to your wife. I did not tape your wife.

500
00:58:44,469 --> 00:58:46,369
I am sorry.
I know nothing about this.

501
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:48,371
- Look, I wanna know one thing.

502
00:58:48,473 --> 00:58:51,067
- Hey look. This had nothing
to do with me. She taped her!

503
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,710
- Where is it?
- What?

504
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:56,177
- The tape!

505
00:58:58,249 --> 00:58:59,113
- Will you do it?

506
00:59:01,252 --> 00:59:03,743
- I suppose so.

507
00:59:03,855 --> 00:59:06,688
- You don't seem very enthusiastic.

508
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:08,816
- It's just that...

509
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,521
- yes?

510
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:14,189
- This is a big chance for me.

511
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:18,667
- And you don't want to screw it up.

512
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:21,364
- Yeah...

513
00:59:24,776 --> 00:59:27,210
- doesn't what I'm going through
mean anything to you?

514
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:35,445
Do I have to beg?

515
00:59:38,022 --> 00:59:39,717
- No.

516
00:59:49,801 --> 00:59:52,634
- You like that?
- No!

517
00:59:52,737 --> 00:59:54,898
- What?
- No!

518
00:59:55,006 --> 00:59:57,133
- Don't do it to other people!

519
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:08,211
- This is going to end pretty soon.

520
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,219
- What?

521
01:00:10,321 --> 01:00:12,221
- The line.

522
01:00:12,323 --> 01:00:14,723
I only booked half-an-hour.

523
01:00:20,832 --> 01:00:22,732
- you have my number.

524
01:00:22,834 --> 01:00:24,734
Call me anytime.

525
01:00:24,836 --> 01:00:26,770
- Okay...

526
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,740
- what are you thinking?

527
01:00:30,842 --> 01:00:32,742
- Nothing.

528
01:00:32,844 --> 01:00:35,745
Why should anything go wrong?
- The doctor said...

529
01:00:35,847 --> 01:00:37,747
- there's a risk, that's all.

530
01:00:37,849 --> 01:00:39,749
And it's a risk I have to take.

531
01:00:39,851 --> 01:00:42,251
You're my sister.
I'm not going to let you die.

532
01:00:42,353 --> 01:00:45,948
- And Lance...
- Yes?

533
01:00:46,057 --> 01:00:48,252
- Congratulations.

534
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:50,259
You must be very excited.

535
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:53,091
- Yes, I am.

536
01:01:34,338 --> 01:01:36,272
- You okay?

537
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:41,744
Look...

538
01:01:41,846 --> 01:01:44,781
I'm sorry about pointing
the finger at you.

539
01:01:48,352 --> 01:01:50,786
You see what I mean about it
being a bit tricky?

540
01:01:52,857 --> 01:01:54,757
- I lost my objectivity.

541
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:57,123
- Well, that can happen.

542
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:03,233
- It doesn't happen to you.
- Maybe it should.

543
01:02:06,304 --> 01:02:09,705
Look. I gotta get back.

544
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:12,139
Can you get home okay?

545
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:17,213
- You don't want me around.

546
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:19,681
- I don't think it would be
such a great idea.

547
01:02:19,784 --> 01:02:22,218
I'll see you at the shop.

548
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,255
Tomorrow. Okay?

549
01:03:30,988 --> 01:03:33,252
- You're probably wondering
how you got the part.

550
01:03:33,357 --> 01:03:35,917
- Well, uh...

551
01:03:36,027 --> 01:03:38,257
- Lance, I'd like you to meet Ronny.

552
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:42,992
You might notice
that you look like Ronny.

553
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,125
That's because you'll be
playing his brother.

554
01:03:45,236 --> 01:03:47,261
He's the guy
you give your lung to.

555
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,240
- I'm not sure I understand.

556
01:03:51,342 --> 01:03:53,833
- The transplant.
You've read the script.

557
01:03:53,945 --> 01:03:55,936
You give your lung to Ronny.

558
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:59,039
- But I thought I gave it
to my sister.

559
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:02,278
- There's been a change.

560
01:04:02,386 --> 01:04:05,378
- Please sit down, Lisa.

561
01:04:08,226 --> 01:04:10,854
We've had a suicide in room 106.

562
01:04:10,962 --> 01:04:14,591
Were you aware of the person
staying in that room?

563
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:17,259
Did you have any...
contact with him?

564
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:23,734
- Well, if you don't have
any questions, Lance,

565
01:04:23,841 --> 01:04:26,036
I suppose we can think
of signing this.

566
01:04:29,814 --> 01:04:31,714
- Shouldn't I have
someone look it over?

567
01:04:31,816 --> 01:04:34,080
- I thought you
didn't have an agent.

568
01:04:34,185 --> 01:04:36,210
- I have a friend. A lawyer.

569
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,220
I mean, if that's okay with you.

570
01:04:38,322 --> 01:04:40,222
- Sure, it's okay with me.

571
01:04:40,324 --> 01:04:42,224
As long as there aren't
any problems.

572
01:04:42,326 --> 01:04:44,226
- I'm sure there won't be any.

573
01:04:44,328 --> 01:04:46,728
- When do you think we might
have this settled?

574
01:04:46,831 --> 01:04:48,731
- I'm meeting my friend tomorrow.

575
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:52,234
- Wednesday morning then.
- Yeah. That should be fine.

576
01:04:52,336 --> 01:04:55,794
- I'll probably be out of town
but we can meet by conference upstairs

577
01:04:55,906 --> 01:04:58,340
Trish will tell you about it.

578
01:04:58,442 --> 01:05:00,273
- You must be busy.

579
01:05:00,378 --> 01:05:03,176
- Ah! I'm shooting three
of these suckers right now.

580
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:05,408
But this one is very special to me.

581
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,953
- Do you know if any of our staff
had any contact with the guest?

582
01:05:13,057 --> 01:05:15,116
- I don't think so.

583
01:05:15,226 --> 01:05:18,718
- Did you see anyone going
into the room? Coming out?

584
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,700
- I don't think so.

585
01:05:24,802 --> 01:05:26,736
- You're sure?

586
01:05:30,908 --> 01:05:33,206
You said before that
you heard someone crying

587
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:35,211
When you delivered the towels.

588
01:05:35,313 --> 01:05:37,213
- Yes.

589
01:05:37,315 --> 01:05:41,217
- You don't think that they may
have been crying over...

590
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:43,219
someone like Lance?

591
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:45,221
- No.

592
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:47,587
- And you're positive about that?

593
01:06:02,506 --> 01:06:05,669
Did Lance ever talk to you

594
01:06:05,776 --> 01:06:08,506
About receiving any gifts
from our guests?

595
01:06:15,286 --> 01:06:18,221
- Housekeeping staff
do not receive gratuities.

596
01:06:55,326 --> 01:06:57,726
- Lance?

597
01:06:57,828 --> 01:06:59,762
How are you feeling?

598
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:03,700
I heard you were sick.

599
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:10,172
I was... just about to watch
one of your movies.

600
01:07:10,274 --> 01:07:13,437
I was wondering
if you wanted to drop by.

601
01:07:16,814 --> 01:07:18,975
I know you don't think
they're anything special,

602
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:21,051
But I do.

603
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:26,518
Lance...

604
01:07:26,624 --> 01:07:29,718
something terrible
happened to me today.

605
01:07:31,962 --> 01:07:34,192
I could have saved someone's life

606
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:36,232
But I ignored him instead.

607
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:40,236
Has that ever happened to you?

608
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,732
Lance? ...

609
01:09:57,675 --> 01:09:59,575
- that's impossible.

610
01:09:59,677 --> 01:10:02,544
- It's true.
I could read it to you.

611
01:10:02,646 --> 01:10:04,944
- You donate your lung
to your brother.

612
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:07,108
- Yes.

613
01:10:07,217 --> 01:10:09,048
- But that's not what happened.

614
01:10:09,153 --> 01:10:11,053
- I know.

615
01:10:11,155 --> 01:10:13,055
- Did you ask him why?

616
01:10:13,157 --> 01:10:15,216
- I... didn't have a chance.

617
01:10:15,326 --> 01:10:17,260
- So what happens to the sister?

618
01:10:19,196 --> 01:10:21,096
- She's not in the script.

619
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:23,564
- They cut me out.

620
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:50,959
You have to ask him why.

621
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:53,086
- Why can't you?

622
01:10:53,197 --> 01:10:55,097
- I'm about to be fired.

623
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,534
Look...

624
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,200
you have to tell him
that you need a sister.

625
01:11:05,309 --> 01:11:08,710
I mean... the part only makes
sense if you have a sister.

626
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:10,746
And if you donate your lung to your...

627
01:11:19,323 --> 01:11:21,257
- you have to do something.

628
01:11:21,358 --> 01:11:23,622
- I will.

629
01:11:25,696 --> 01:11:27,596
Look, it's going to be difficult

630
01:11:27,698 --> 01:11:29,757
To keep coming here to see you.

631
01:11:31,835 --> 01:11:33,769
- You have my phone number.

632
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,740
- Yes. I'll call you.

633
01:11:38,842 --> 01:11:41,538
- Promise?

634
01:11:43,347 --> 01:11:44,939
- Yes.

635
01:12:04,501 --> 01:12:07,197
- You can't ask me not to worry.

636
01:12:07,304 --> 01:12:10,171
- No.

637
01:12:10,274 --> 01:12:13,107
But I can ask you to stay calm.

638
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:16,145
- If they do any sort of investigation,
they'll know I was here.

639
01:12:17,314 --> 01:12:20,147
- Of course you were here.
You're the maid.

640
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,241
- Lance?

641
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:26,516
What's happening?

642
01:12:28,592 --> 01:12:30,492
- We're having a talk.

643
01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:32,494
- About what?

644
01:12:32,596 --> 01:12:35,030
- I can't tell you.

645
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:36,429
- Why not?

646
01:12:38,836 --> 01:12:41,270
- Because she wants
to keep it a secret.

647
01:12:44,675 --> 01:12:46,302
- What's going on?

648
01:12:50,948 --> 01:12:52,575
Answer me!

649
01:12:54,718 --> 01:12:56,618
- She can't hear you, Lisa.

650
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,245
- Can she hear you?

651
01:12:59,356 --> 01:13:01,324
- Then ask her.

652
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:14,301
Lance...

653
01:13:14,404 --> 01:13:17,237
Lance... do you need any help?

654
01:13:19,743 --> 01:13:22,007
How do I get there?

655
01:13:27,851 --> 01:13:29,978
Lance?

656
01:13:38,028 --> 01:13:40,758
- Can we move the monitor
a little to the left, please.

657
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:45,324
Thanks. Great.
Thanks very much.

658
01:13:47,404 --> 01:13:50,271
- Two things.
- Yeah.

659
01:13:50,374 --> 01:13:54,242
- First of all,
I want a hotel room

660
01:13:54,344 --> 01:13:56,244
For the entire length of the shooting.

661
01:13:56,346 --> 01:13:57,745
- Why?

662
01:13:57,848 --> 01:14:01,113
- I won't be able to concentrate
on the role if I stay at home.

663
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:03,686
- Okay. I'll buy that.
What's the second point?

664
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:10,283
- I don't think my character
should donate the lung to his brother.

665
01:14:10,394 --> 01:14:13,090
- No?
- No. I think it was better...

666
01:14:13,197 --> 01:14:15,791
when it was his sister.
Like in the first draft.

667
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:20,131
And I also don't like the idea
of the tv talk show at the end.

668
01:14:20,237 --> 01:14:22,205
- You don't.
- No.

669
01:14:22,306 --> 01:14:24,706
I think it was better
the way it was.

670
01:14:24,808 --> 01:14:26,708
- And... why is that?

671
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:28,903
- It seemed to be more authentic.

672
01:14:30,981 --> 01:14:34,314
- Authentic... to what?

673
01:14:34,418 --> 01:14:37,785
- To the integrity of the story.

674
01:14:37,888 --> 01:14:40,220
- Can you be more specific?

675
01:14:40,324 --> 01:14:42,758
- I think the author's point
has been cheapened.

676
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:48,264
- Do you know who I am?

677
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:51,733
- Yes.

678
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:53,735
- Do you have any idea

679
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:56,738
Of the sort of background
I bring to a project like this?

680
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,398
- Yeah.

681
01:14:58,508 --> 01:15:00,635
- You probably used to watch
some of my shows

682
01:15:00,744 --> 01:15:02,371
When you were a kid, right?

683
01:15:04,281 --> 01:15:07,182
Did you watch television
when you were a kid?

684
01:15:07,284 --> 01:15:09,184
- Yes.

685
01:15:09,286 --> 01:15:11,982
- Then you used to watch
some of my shows.

686
01:15:12,089 --> 01:15:14,523
- So what's your point?

687
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:17,185
- My point is, who the fuck
do you think you are?

688
01:15:22,466 --> 01:15:24,366
- All I'm suggesting...

689
01:15:24,468 --> 01:15:26,959
- you've been talking to Clara,
haven't you?

690
01:15:35,812 --> 01:15:38,713
Look. I just want to make sure

691
01:15:38,815 --> 01:15:41,545
That we're working
with the best script possible.

692
01:15:41,652 --> 01:15:43,176
Do you understand?

693
01:15:45,322 --> 01:15:47,790
- But it's a personal story.

694
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:50,223
- Of course it is.
It's a very personal story

695
01:15:50,327 --> 01:15:52,693
And I respect that.

696
01:15:52,796 --> 01:15:56,562
I just want to make sure
that it works as a story.

697
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:58,897
That's my job.

698
01:15:59,002 --> 01:16:01,368
I'm giving a lot to this show.

699
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:04,599
I'm directing it.
I'm even gonna act in it.

700
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:07,677
I know it was
a traumatic event for Clara.

701
01:16:07,778 --> 01:16:09,939
She was close to her brother.

702
01:16:10,047 --> 01:16:13,073
A man gives up a lung
to save his sister's life.

703
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,448
This is an extraordinary event,
isn't it?

704
01:16:18,956 --> 01:16:20,981
- And he dies as a result.

705
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:23,184
This moves me, Lance.

706
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:25,523
This moves me so much,

707
01:16:25,629 --> 01:16:28,154
I want to make it
into a very fine film.

708
01:16:28,265 --> 01:16:30,825
Something I can share
with millions of people.

709
01:16:30,934 --> 01:16:33,232
- Her brother actually died?

710
01:16:35,305 --> 01:16:37,239
- She didn't tell you.

711
01:16:41,078 --> 01:16:42,739
Tragic.

712
01:16:46,383 --> 01:16:49,409
Clara's script deals
with what she went through.

713
01:16:49,519 --> 01:16:52,283
But that wasn't what interested me.

714
01:16:52,389 --> 01:16:55,586
So I optioned her story
and made it mine.

715
01:16:55,692 --> 01:16:58,718
And a movie that takes
the form of a talk show

716
01:16:58,829 --> 01:17:00,660
Is very original, Lance.

717
01:17:00,764 --> 01:17:02,664
I'd watch it.

718
01:17:02,766 --> 01:17:05,667
And people have always watched
what I'd like to watch.

719
01:17:05,769 --> 01:17:08,670
You have,
ever since you were a kid.

720
01:17:08,772 --> 01:17:10,501
Right?

721
01:17:15,912 --> 01:17:19,006
So are you ready to sign
the contract now or not?

722
01:17:24,221 --> 01:17:27,315
Okay. Then sign it.

723
01:17:41,138 --> 01:17:43,606
Good. I'll see you on set.

724
01:18:19,276 --> 01:18:21,176
Hi. Lance isn't in right now.

725
01:18:21,278 --> 01:18:24,304
Please leave a message.

726
01:18:24,414 --> 01:18:26,211
Hi. I...

727
01:18:28,285 --> 01:18:30,219
just watched
your audition again today.

728
01:18:32,289 --> 01:18:36,726
I'm... I'm dying to see you
in the film.

729
01:18:38,795 --> 01:18:40,592
Lance...

730
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,598
why... why aren't you
returning my messages?

731
01:18:48,672 --> 01:18:50,640
I have to know what he said.

732
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,867
Do you...

733
01:18:52,976 --> 01:18:55,240
do you care about me at all?

734
01:18:57,314 --> 01:18:59,373
Do you...

735
01:18:59,483 --> 01:19:02,043
do you know what I'm going through?

736
01:19:15,098 --> 01:19:17,032
- You haven't been getting
enough sleep.

737
01:19:19,102 --> 01:19:21,002
- The tape is different.

738
01:19:21,104 --> 01:19:24,267
- What do you mean?
- The tape is different.

739
01:19:24,374 --> 01:19:26,808
- All right. Calm down.
I'll have a look at it.

740
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:29,174
- Eddy...

741
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,611
I saw things.

742
01:19:31,715 --> 01:19:34,309
Things I hadn't seen before.

743
01:19:34,417 --> 01:19:36,851
- What?
Other meanings?

744
01:19:36,953 --> 01:19:39,217
- Yes.

745
01:19:39,322 --> 01:19:41,051
- I guess that's normal.

746
01:19:41,158 --> 01:19:43,888
- And other scenes.

747
01:19:43,994 --> 01:19:46,019
- That's not possible.

748
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,933
Listen. I think it'd be a good idea if
you cooled off these tapes for awhile.

749
01:19:54,037 --> 01:19:57,200
Get some sleep.
- He's suffering, eddy.

750
01:19:57,307 --> 01:19:58,831
- Who?
- Lance!

751
01:20:05,815 --> 01:20:07,749
- Lisa...

752
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:15,124
get some sleep.

753
01:20:30,407 --> 01:20:34,935
- Now, what I want you to do
is pretend that this is a real show.

754
01:20:35,045 --> 01:20:38,071
As if it were being broadcast live,

755
01:20:38,181 --> 01:20:40,809
And you are actual participants.

756
01:20:45,555 --> 01:20:48,115
Now, the topic of the show
is organ transplants.

757
01:20:48,225 --> 01:20:51,251
And this is a life and death issue.

758
01:20:51,361 --> 01:20:55,593
Obviously, I need the tension
level here to be quite high.

759
01:20:55,699 --> 01:20:57,599
A number of you sitting
in the front rows

760
01:20:57,701 --> 01:21:01,000
Have been told that you have relatives
or children who are in need of donors.

761
01:21:01,104 --> 01:21:03,004
And the actors sitting up here

762
01:21:03,106 --> 01:21:06,701
Are doctors who specialize
in the type of operations

763
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:10,405
That could save the lives
of your loved ones.

764
01:21:18,822 --> 01:21:20,756
I'd like to take a moment here

765
01:21:20,857 --> 01:21:22,757
To introduce Lance.

766
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:24,759
Lance will be playing
the brother of David,

767
01:21:24,861 --> 01:21:27,989
The man we're watching on
the live feed from the hospital.

768
01:21:28,098 --> 01:21:31,033
Can we see the live-Feed image
for a moment?

769
01:21:39,843 --> 01:21:42,209
Can you hear me there, ron?

770
01:21:42,312 --> 01:21:44,246
Ron?

771
01:22:04,301 --> 01:22:08,203
It's obvious that David isn't
the only person in this country

772
01:22:08,305 --> 01:22:11,001
Suffering from this disease.

773
01:22:11,107 --> 01:22:14,565
But he is certainly the only one lucky
enough to be on national television.

774
01:22:14,678 --> 01:22:17,169
And then, I suppose
the question becomes,

775
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,647
Who gets on tv
to ask for a body organ?

776
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:22,377
Who decides?

777
01:22:22,485 --> 01:22:23,975
Dr. Spencer,

778
01:22:24,087 --> 01:22:26,214
Is there something
you want to say about this?

779
01:22:28,091 --> 01:22:31,925
- Well... the main problem
is getting access to the donors.

780
01:22:32,028 --> 01:22:34,826
The public doesn't seem to be aware

781
01:22:34,931 --> 01:22:36,728
Of the desperate need for organs.

782
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:39,461
- Okay. Okay. But let's take
the case of David.

783
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:42,163
How often does a lung become available

784
01:22:42,272 --> 01:22:44,672
- Not too often.
That's because

785
01:22:44,774 --> 01:22:47,504
In a trauma such as,
say, a car accident,

786
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:51,046
A lung is one of the first
things to get damaged.

787
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:04,192
- Let's talk to David's parents.

788
01:23:04,294 --> 01:23:06,421
Can we move the camera

789
01:23:06,529 --> 01:23:08,690
Out into the hallway?

790
01:23:08,798 --> 01:23:11,733
Go into the hall and chat there,
for a second.

791
01:23:13,803 --> 01:23:15,703
If you've just joined us,

792
01:23:15,805 --> 01:23:19,866
David is a young man desperately
in need of an organ transplant.

793
01:23:21,478 --> 01:23:23,912
I don't mean to make your lives

794
01:23:24,013 --> 01:23:26,243
Anymore complicated
than they are right now, but...

795
01:23:26,349 --> 01:23:28,817
something extraordinarily dramatic

796
01:23:28,918 --> 01:23:31,216
Is happening to you today.

797
01:23:31,321 --> 01:23:33,983
Can you give us any indication -

798
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,558
And I know this isn't
the best time to ask -

799
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:38,593
Of what's going through your mind?

800
01:23:54,344 --> 01:23:56,244
Can we see David again?

801
01:23:56,346 --> 01:23:59,941
Would the camera person there go
in the room again just one more time?

802
01:24:01,785 --> 01:24:03,685
However traumatic this may be,

803
01:24:03,787 --> 01:24:06,085
Even for those of you
in the comfort of your homes,

804
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:08,089
I want you to meet David.

805
01:24:08,191 --> 01:24:12,093
David doesn't want
any special attention.

806
01:24:13,129 --> 01:24:16,792
He just wants a chance
to have his story told.

807
01:24:19,636 --> 01:24:21,831
- Excuse me.
- Yes. Who are you?

808
01:24:21,938 --> 01:24:23,269
- I'm...

809
01:24:23,373 --> 01:24:25,398
David's brother.

810
01:24:26,743 --> 01:24:29,803
- David's brother?
- Yes.

811
01:24:34,284 --> 01:24:36,275
- Is this man your son?

812
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:49,125
- I want to make a donation.

813
01:25:35,545 --> 01:25:37,672
No!!!
