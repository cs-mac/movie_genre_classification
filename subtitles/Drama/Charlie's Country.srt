1
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:52,347
Yeah.

2
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:51,756
Yeah.

3
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:20,723
How are you, Pops?

4
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,752
Yeah good!

5
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:38,232
Good morning.

6
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:03,122
You come from far away
and bring us alcohol,

7
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:04,723
ganja, tobacco...

8
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:06,758
all bad!

9
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,561
G'day Luke.

10
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:12,496
G'day Charlie.

11
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:14,824
You white bastard.

12
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,759
You black bastard.

13
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,982
Have a good day.

14
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:32,512
Is that it?

15
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:34,347
I'm off then.

16
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:44,023
Pete!

17
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:46,904
Lot of rubbish in your truck.

18
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:49,827
Lot of rubbish in your head.

19
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:57,434
Charlie?

20
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,196
Don't just walk past.

21
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:04,825
-I don't need a big note.
-No worries.

22
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,871
Forty-three forty cents.

23
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:20,387
But I've only got $20!

24
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:23,428
-Here you go.
-Need some more?

25
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,391
I'm okay now.

26
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,467
Hey, hey, hey, not so many!

27
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:39,308
-Another one.
-No.

28
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,269
Leave some for me!

29
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,190
Hey old man,
bring me back a cigarette!

30
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:22,096
This house...

31
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:27,078
...this is the sort of
house I want.

32
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:35,097
If it's like this house,
then it'll be okay.

33
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:30,941
Sit down, Charlie.

34
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,293
What do you want, Charlie?

35
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,894
I want a house.

36
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,050
-You've got a house.
-Nah.

37
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,432
Too many people.

38
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,933
My family.

39
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,001
No room, see?

40
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:00,657
I want a house for me.

41
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:06,677
Government's already
given you one good house.

42
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:07,811
You wanna walk away
from that,

43
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:09,812
that's your problem.

44
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:13,267
But Errol,
you got a wife, ey?

45
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:16,084
No.

46
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:17,765
You get a house.

47
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:20,087
While I'm here
I've got a house.

48
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:21,421
Goes with the job.

49
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,182
You've got a job

50
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,431
and you got a house...

51
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,828
on my land.

52
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,458
Where's my house?

53
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,434
Where's my job?

54
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:47,561
Anything else you want,
Charlie?

55
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,644
Nah.

56
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,199
You coming hunting?

57
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:49,631
There's a buffalo around,
up the road a bit.

58
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:51,232
You not working?

59
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,013
Truck broke down,

60
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:56,661
waiting on a new one
from Darwin.

61
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,443
Got the starter?

62
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:06,944
In the back.

63
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,317
Make way.

64
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,131
Let's get going.

65
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,325
Away you go.

66
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,060
Done.

67
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,617
Where are we going?

68
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:35,766
Where I saw some tracks.

69
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,267
You ready?

70
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:39,669
Good to go.

71
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,050
Look, there, there, there!

72
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:46,241
-Got him!
-Beautiful shooting!

73
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,432
-Right in the heart!
-Straight through the heart!

74
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:52,073
One shot and he went down.

75
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:57,664
-Watch out!
-He's come alive!

76
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:01,708
Run! Run!

77
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,109
Turn! Turn! Shoot! Shoot!

78
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,153
Got him this time!

79
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,141
Shot him properly!

80
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,057
This time we both got him!

81
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:20,136
My legs are aching...

82
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:30,418
...and I'm hungry for meat.

83
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,230
We should have shot...

84
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:40,126
...a small one.

85
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,341
This one is wrecking my car.

86
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,330
No this is a good one,
plenty of meat.

87
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:55,687
There's a car parked there!

88
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,055
Where?

89
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:58,556
In the trees.

90
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,459
It's a policeman!

91
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,927
A policeman's parked there!

92
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,848
Sit down, sit down!

93
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,833
Don't panic...

94
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,434
sit down slowly.

95
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,882
Sit down very slowly.

96
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:21,952
I better sit down slowly too.

97
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:47,663
We're searching
every car for grog, Charlie.

98
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:50,599
No alcohol comin'
in here anymore.

99
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,280
What's in there?

100
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:55,322
Petrol,
keep the car going.

101
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,839
You got cigarette?

102
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Get out of the car.

103
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:14,953
Who owns this?

104
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:16,634
Me, that's mine.

105
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,691
And the other one
was mine.

106
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:23,212
Did y'all purchase
permits for 'em?

107
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:26,228
You got a license?

108
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,529
License?

109
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,930
We're not gonna
drive them,

110
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:31,651
we're just gonna shoot 'em.

111
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,700
Smart-ass.

112
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:51,174
They've got my car...

113
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,216
...bugger shit.

114
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:56,524
And your rifle and my gun.

115
00:16:57,954 --> 00:17:00,434
And all that tender meat.

116
00:17:01,157 --> 00:17:05,797
That'll soon stink up
the whole police station!

117
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,960
And then the maggots will be
crawling through it in no time!

118
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:44,692
Pst!

119
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:51,097
Pst! Pst!

120
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:56,601
Charlie!

121
00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:58,302
It's Gaz.

122
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:02,845
Charlie! It's Gaz.

123
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:15,214
Are you awake?

124
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:17,249
It's Gaz.

125
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:21,119
What do you want?

126
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,280
We need to camp somewhere
out of the way.

127
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:29,726
I know you.

128
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:31,641
You got anywhere?

129
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:33,196
You got any ganja?

130
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,263
Yeah, yeah, later.

131
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:36,584
We need the camp first.

132
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,167
Sure, why not?

133
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:06,526
Now, Charlie...

134
00:19:07,194 --> 00:19:09,114
this is primo shit.

135
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,290
The best of the best.

136
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,233
Gonna make you
really happy.

137
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,734
Okay?

138
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:28,103
Stop here, stop, stop.

139
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:52,698
What now?

140
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:54,733
See that tree there?

141
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:55,934
Yeah.

142
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,936
That's where
you're gonna go.

143
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:02,097
And this road'll take you
right up there.

144
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:04,275
Watch out for crocodile, too.

145
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:05,876
Are you serious?

146
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:07,077
Yeah.

147
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:08,578
Oh, great.

148
00:20:10,814 --> 00:20:13,294
-And?
-Yeah, I'm comin'.

149
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,284
Wait now...

150
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:18,125
how much for them?

151
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:20,093
Fifty, like always.

152
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:21,621
-Fifty?
-Yeah.

153
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:49,736
Anything to eat?

154
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:00,051
I can't eat this.

155
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:05,295
I have no money left

156
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:07,517
or food.

157
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:15,724
I'm hungry.

158
00:22:23,832 --> 00:22:27,272
There's lots of food
in the bush.

159
00:22:30,004 --> 00:22:33,444
It's like
a supermarket out there.

160
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,320
Mm-hmm.

161
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:57,392
Mm-hmm.

162
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,166
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

163
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:21,792
Why don't you
answer your phone?

164
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:23,895
Got no recharge left.

165
00:23:29,087 --> 00:23:30,587
Mm-hmm.

166
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:37,705
We need you
to teach the kids...

167
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,589
...how to dance...

168
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:45,332
...properly.

169
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,910
The kids go to school now.

170
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:56,406
They don't care anymore.

171
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:00,503
We need to teach them

172
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:03,479
the traditional ways.

173
00:24:08,252 --> 00:24:10,652
Get Bobby to teach them.

174
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:15,489
He can do it.

175
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:19,198
He knows how to lead them.

176
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,052
Shit.

177
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,987
Oh shit.

178
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,993
Charlie.

179
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,763
Hey Charlie.

180
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,346
Charlie, how are you?

181
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,603
Um, some white guys
in town,

182
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:10,205
we think they might
be trouble.

183
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:12,366
Selling the ol' ganja.

184
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:15,610
Heard you might be able
to track 'em for us.

185
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:17,011
Come on.

186
00:25:17,012 --> 00:25:18,852
I'll owe you one.

187
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:28,787
Now, I don't really
like this postin' too much.

188
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:29,788
I mean,
the people are nice

189
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:31,055
like good ol' Charlie here,

190
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:32,322
but it's just...

191
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,656
it's isolated,
it's remote.

192
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,057
Don't know.

193
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:35,757
I'm one for the big city,

194
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:37,258
you know PC?

195
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:39,226
Hmm.

196
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,361
-Yup.
-I like the high life.

197
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:42,328
Stop, stop, stop.

198
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:43,829
Stop, stop.

199
00:25:56,741 --> 00:25:58,241
Get out.

200
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:42,882
That drive there
means stop.

201
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,679
And here,
came back here,

202
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:50,229
and then he went this way.

203
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,839
Yesterday 10 o'clock.

204
00:26:55,229 --> 00:26:59,131
Damn, you black fellas
are smart when you wanna be.

205
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:00,632
Jesus.

206
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,166
Yeah.

207
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,622
Hey, hey, come here.

208
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:32,811
Shh, down, down, down,
down, down, down.

209
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:35,228
Come, come.

210
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:38,383
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

211
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:44,468
Right there.

212
00:27:44,469 --> 00:27:47,989
It's...it's two cars
with a tent.

213
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:51,339
They're camping.

214
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,773
-Okay?
-Okay.

215
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:54,541
You'll be all right now?

216
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:56,342
I'm going back to town.

217
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:57,343
What?

218
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,511
It's 15 kilometers away.

219
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,913
Shortcut through the bush.

220
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,414
See you later.

221
00:28:48,622 --> 00:28:50,382
Anything to smoke?

222
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:03,400
The cops nearly caught me,

223
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:08,204
but those white fellas
got caught good and proper,

224
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,965
and I'd got this

225
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:13,913
but I hadn't
paid him yet either.

226
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:19,780
Serves him right,
always ripping us off.

227
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:21,748
Is this worth fifty dollars?

228
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:25,109
-No fucking way!
-It's big money.

229
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:28,126
And I didn't pay him!

230
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,468
Can you look
after him for a bit?

231
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:46,969
Stuff to do...

232
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:50,038
See you later.

233
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:54,141
See you.

234
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,704
He won't go anywhere.

235
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:47,249
You know I'm sick don't you?

236
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,680
My kidneys are no good.

237
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:56,324
Soon they'll stop working.

238
00:31:00,904 --> 00:31:02,404
Yeah.

239
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:04,672
I know you're sick.

240
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:07,575
I know that.

241
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:18,564
It's all that...

242
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:22,446
...white man junk food we eat.

243
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,999
They'll take me to Darwin.

244
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:42,229
Then you'll die
in the wrong place...

245
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:46,706
...a long way
from your country.

246
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:53,413
A long way.

247
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,530
There'll be no one with you...

248
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:11,294
...no one to look after you.

249
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:25,741
Right, we'll put you down
as a recreational shooter then.

250
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:27,142
What?

251
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:28,643
Recreational?

252
00:32:28,878 --> 00:32:31,012
Hunting is not
recreational.

253
00:32:31,013 --> 00:32:32,146
It's for food.

254
00:32:32,147 --> 00:32:34,627
You still need a license.

255
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,290
How much it gonna cost me?

256
00:32:38,552 --> 00:32:39,785
Sixty dollars.

257
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:42,621
Sixty dollars
to buy my gun back?

258
00:32:42,622 --> 00:32:44,789
Charlie, you're not
getting your gun back.

259
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,950
It's been confiscated.

260
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,080
You're stealing it.

261
00:32:50,395 --> 00:32:52,929
Look, you can't have
a purchase permit for it.

262
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,497
All right, you illegally
modified it

263
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:55,798
to be a concealable weapon.

264
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,479
You're lucky Brum
didn't charge you!

265
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:03,936
But I didn't know that.

266
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:07,298
I know,
it's just not an excuse.

267
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,900
I'm not
a recreational shooter...

268
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:32,327
I am...

269
00:33:34,163 --> 00:33:35,663
...a hunter.

270
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:46,005
I danced for

271
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,075
the Queen of England

272
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,379
when they opened
that building...

273
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:59,209
I bet you never did that.

274
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:11,294
And again.

275
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,530
Okay.

276
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:26,136
Good thing you gave up
smoking when you did, Charlie.

277
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:29,097
Your lungs
are packin' it in.

278
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,672
Next time you're in Darwin,

279
00:34:30,673 --> 00:34:33,641
we should get
your chest X-rayed.

280
00:34:33,642 --> 00:34:36,076
But you gotta
look after yourself.

281
00:34:36,077 --> 00:34:38,077
No more ganja, okay?

282
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,081
And you need
to eat better.

283
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,582
Eat what?

284
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,810
White fella junk food?

285
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,787
Yeah, it's a problem.

286
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:51,656
Fuckin' yeah, it's a problem.

287
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,524
See this? Doesn't fit.

288
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,158
I can't eat with 'em,

289
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,199
and I can't eat
without them.

290
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,763
I'm starving.

291
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,599
Well, look,
I'm not the dentist.

292
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,968
You gotta wait
for the dentist to come.

293
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,209
I'll be dead by then.

294
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:54,302
What are you doing?

295
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:57,572
Making a spear.

296
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:02,756
Why?

297
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:05,158
For hunting.

298
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:10,395
Catch something to eat.

299
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:12,956
Why don't you use a gun?

300
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:15,265
Why don't you go away?

301
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:17,426
Go and play somewhere.

302
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:36,451
One, two, three.

303
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:46,915
-Hey Charlie.
-Hey Luke!

304
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,156
What do you got there?

305
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:51,852
I made a spear.

306
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,353
Hunting spear.

307
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:55,655
Wow.

308
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,257
It's incredible
but I'm gonna have to take it.

309
00:37:58,258 --> 00:37:59,524
What?

310
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:00,892
Well, you can't just go
walking through town

311
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:01,993
with a dangerous weapon.

312
00:38:01,994 --> 00:38:03,394
It's not a dangerous weapon.

313
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:06,163
It's a hunting spear,
not a battle spear.

314
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:07,864
You know what happened
in that other community.

315
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:09,899
One bloke dead and the other
one in the hospital.

316
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,300
But you took my gun!

317
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:12,801
Come on.

318
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:15,770
It's a dangerous weapon,

319
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:18,811
I'm gonna have
to destroy it.

320
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,542
Well, fuck you then.

321
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:25,617
Treacherous bastard!

322
00:38:44,997 --> 00:38:47,077
Fuck those thieving...

323
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:51,848
...white bastards.

324
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:33,411
Why did you come here?

325
00:39:35,174 --> 00:39:39,174
From far away...
stealing people's stuff!

326
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,718
Is this your land?

327
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,740
Fucking bastard.

328
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,958
I need to get money too.

329
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,639
I want my money!

330
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:02,095
All my money, the whole lot!

331
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:06,365
Where is it? I need it now!

332
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,950
What's going on?

333
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,673
That's a police car!

334
00:40:50,674 --> 00:40:52,434
I'm borrowing it.

335
00:40:55,444 --> 00:40:57,684
They took your rifle...

336
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:01,948
...and your car.

337
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:06,231
They took my spear...

338
00:41:09,622 --> 00:41:11,122
...and my gun.

339
00:41:16,494 --> 00:41:19,854
I work for them
catching criminals

340
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,450
and they don't pay me.

341
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,591
They stole our land

342
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:35,528
and put a police station on it.

343
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,550
They're lucky.

344
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:48,165
<i>I'm only borrowing their car!</i>

345
00:41:48,488 --> 00:41:51,128
We'll bring it back later.

346
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:58,548
Where are we going?

347
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:01,057
Live the old way.

348
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:05,681
What's that for?

349
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,470
No electricity there.

350
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:13,173
Carrying water.

351
00:42:20,547 --> 00:42:23,907
Where we used
to sleep as kids...

352
00:42:24,017 --> 00:42:26,897
...we'll hunt and fish there.

353
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,064
...going bush, going bush...

354
00:42:35,326 --> 00:42:37,694
...going to my
Mother Country...

355
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,495
...yes, your Mother Country...

356
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:47,902
Second, second.

357
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:07,153
This is not
your Mother Country.

358
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:10,222
No. This is where
we run out of fuel!

359
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:12,223
The fuel's run out!

360
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,691
We've barely left...

361
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:18,452
...and we've already
run out of fuel!

362
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,685
-I'm off then. See you.
-Yeah.

363
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:29,438
You'll be back as soon
as you're hungry!

364
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:31,919
Plenty of food out there!

365
00:43:34,342 --> 00:43:35,842
Yeah eh?

366
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:51,938
Good tucker, this.

367
00:45:05,424 --> 00:45:06,924
Our food...

368
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:35,696
He took my spear,
that policeman.

369
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:40,873
"This spear got no license."

370
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,750
Why take my spear?
Are you going to throw it?

371
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:51,577
Good, good, good.

372
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:55,947
Not bad.

373
00:48:01,352 --> 00:48:04,952
Long time since
I painted anything...

374
00:48:26,306 --> 00:48:29,586
I've been waiting
for you, Fish.

375
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,731
Oh! You're beautifully cooked.

376
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:45,721
That's what I want.

377
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,562
Yes! My Barramundi.

378
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:01,301
Well done.

379
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:11,821
Oh! You're cooked
just right, Fish...

380
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:19,082
Ah Fish...

381
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,250
Hey Fish...

382
00:49:21,885 --> 00:49:23,385
Good Fish...

383
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:41,069
Mm, mm.

384
00:49:42,538 --> 00:49:43,070
Mm.

385
00:49:43,071 --> 00:49:44,671
Very good, Fish.

386
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:48,541
Good fish, yeah.

387
00:50:01,554 --> 00:50:05,394
I've been away fishing,
now I'm home.

388
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:10,907
I'm eating well.

389
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:17,531
It's my own supermarket.

390
00:50:17,867 --> 00:50:21,102
Here, I'll wrap
some fish for you.

391
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:23,663
Just a minute...I'm busy.

392
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,607
I'm free now!

393
00:50:29,976 --> 00:50:31,476
Yeah.

394
00:50:32,578 --> 00:50:33,578
Lot of fish...

395
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:35,079
I have my own supermarket!

396
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,580
Yeah!

397
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:38,948
And this is my country!

398
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:39,949
I can dance with it!

399
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,350
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap!

400
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:26,258
The ancestors
used to eat these.

401
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:32,765
Ashes.

402
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:38,015
They'd sit by the fire here.

403
00:55:42,407 --> 00:55:44,647
They've all passed on.

404
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:48,978
Gone.

405
00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:54,548
No one left.

406
01:01:15,512 --> 01:01:17,012
Me...

407
01:01:18,114 --> 01:01:20,754
...me at the Opera House...

408
01:01:22,718 --> 01:01:26,798
...and to its cultural
and community life.

409
01:01:30,558 --> 01:01:32,718
The Queen was there...

410
01:01:33,294 --> 01:01:36,894
...declaring
the Sydney Opera House...

411
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,204
...and opened it...

412
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:42,707
...the Opera House.

413
01:01:44,437 --> 01:01:45,937
Just a boy...

414
01:01:49,842 --> 01:01:51,522
...and the Queen.

415
01:02:43,523 --> 01:02:46,643
Mother Country
is a long way...

416
01:02:47,627 --> 01:02:49,127
...too far...

417
01:02:58,503 --> 01:03:00,583
...I can't see it...

418
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,940
...my Mother...

419
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:49,353
Fuck, you're hard to find.

420
01:03:54,853 --> 01:03:56,453
Charlie, Charlie.

421
01:03:56,855 --> 01:04:01,255
I thought I told you
to look after yourself.

422
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:02,592
We need to get him
to hospital.

423
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:03,859
Today?

424
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,727
See if the medevac's
available.

425
01:04:05,728 --> 01:04:08,629
Charter a plane
if you have to.

426
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:13,030
It's off to Darwin
with you now, my friend.

427
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:38,910
Well...

428
01:05:39,445 --> 01:05:42,645
you're looking
much better, huh?

429
01:05:48,353 --> 01:05:49,886
Do you mind if I call
you Charlie?

430
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:53,623
I have difficulty
pronouncing foreign names.

431
01:05:53,624 --> 01:05:55,704
Now I'm a foreigner?

432
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,360
Sorry?

433
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,130
You a doctor?

434
01:06:02,598 --> 01:06:04,098
Yes, yes.

435
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:08,435
Well, I, uh...

436
01:06:09,904 --> 01:06:13,506
I believe you were
found in the bush, Charlie.

437
01:06:13,507 --> 01:06:15,507
I born in the bush.

438
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:18,662
I didn't find me
in the bush.

439
01:06:19,412 --> 01:06:23,972
I see you still have
your sense of humor, ey?

440
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,800
I want a doctor.

441
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:23,361
Fuck this.

442
01:08:25,897 --> 01:08:27,397
Home...

443
01:08:31,835 --> 01:08:34,075
...we have to go home.

444
01:09:43,869 --> 01:09:46,270
What's going on here, Charlie?

445
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:48,405
-I'm leaving.
-Are you? Okay.

446
01:09:48,406 --> 01:09:49,973
Um, is there something
I can help you with?

447
01:09:49,974 --> 01:09:51,307
No, you can't
keep me here.

448
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:52,308
Yeah, but you're
not well, okay?

449
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:53,776
You haven't been discharged.

450
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:57,457
Come back with me,
come on, come on!

451
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,651
Wow.

452
01:10:52,762 --> 01:10:55,162
You gonna buy some grog?

453
01:11:01,403 --> 01:11:02,923
Are you banned?

454
01:11:08,442 --> 01:11:09,942
I'm okay...

455
01:11:11,044 --> 01:11:13,364
I'm allowed to buy it.

456
01:11:18,249 --> 01:11:19,749
This one.

457
01:11:23,786 --> 01:11:26,026
Something else as well.

458
01:11:50,145 --> 01:11:52,065
Give him your I.D.

459
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:57,016
Got some I.D., mate?

460
01:11:57,017 --> 01:11:58,517
Yeah, yeah.

461
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:07,925
That's me.

462
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:25,575
Yeah, all good.

463
01:12:25,576 --> 01:12:27,076
Right.

464
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,413
You really are not banned.

465
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:45,512
Yeah I'm good.

466
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:51,250
Where are we going?

467
01:12:53,266 --> 01:12:55,986
Going home to have a drink.

468
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:05,175
Wait! It's the cops.

469
01:13:05,176 --> 01:13:06,943
We've got better things
to do than clean up

470
01:13:06,944 --> 01:13:08,444
after you lot!

471
01:13:08,912 --> 01:13:10,992
Quick. Hide the grog!

472
01:13:11,948 --> 01:13:14,416
-I'm allowed.
-But I'm banned.

473
01:13:14,417 --> 01:13:15,917
I'm banned!

474
01:13:16,152 --> 01:13:21,022
If you give me grog then
you'll be banned and go to jail.

475
01:13:21,023 --> 01:13:24,859
You know you're not
supposed to camp here!

476
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,360
Piss off!

477
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:30,589
Go back to your community!

478
01:13:47,579 --> 01:13:49,339
Look at the mess!

479
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:52,374
My home, what a mess.

480
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:54,683
What a mess!

481
01:13:55,318 --> 01:13:58,038
They should just shoot us...

482
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:01,021
...like in the old days.

483
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:03,691
Hey you lot!

484
01:14:04,026 --> 01:14:06,160
All's clear,
you can come out now!

485
01:14:06,161 --> 01:14:09,281
We've got one here
not banned!

486
01:14:11,999 --> 01:14:15,839
Come out from that grass,
we got grog!

487
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:31,530
You bring shame to us.

488
01:17:38,164 --> 01:17:40,724
She's wrong skin for you.

489
01:17:53,178 --> 01:17:55,418
You've broken the law.

490
01:18:05,122 --> 01:18:08,562
And that's poison
you're drinking,

491
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,480
it rots your brain.

492
01:18:26,374 --> 01:18:29,909
I don't know
what's wrong with him...

493
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:31,243
...shaming us.

494
01:18:31,244 --> 01:18:32,744
Who knows?

495
01:18:34,847 --> 01:18:37,327
Why is he like that now?

496
01:18:37,449 --> 01:18:40,451
He didn't go
the straight way,

497
01:18:40,452 --> 01:18:42,692
he went any which way.

498
01:18:43,655 --> 01:18:47,095
He just helped himself
to a woman.

499
01:18:57,868 --> 01:18:58,868
Nothing left.

500
01:18:58,869 --> 01:19:00,236
I'll get some,

501
01:19:00,237 --> 01:19:03,037
there's some
in my account.

502
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,280
Yup.

503
01:19:17,849 --> 01:19:20,584
You can't be drinking
all this by yourself.

504
01:19:20,585 --> 01:19:22,985
You buying this for her?

505
01:19:23,888 --> 01:19:25,388
Here.

506
01:19:26,924 --> 01:19:29,325
Mate, you wanna be careful.

507
01:19:29,326 --> 01:19:31,627
Coppers are trying
to stop this sort of thing.

508
01:19:31,628 --> 01:19:33,295
They came here
and asked me to report

509
01:19:33,296 --> 01:19:36,176
any suspicious
grog purchases.

510
01:19:37,566 --> 01:19:39,700
I've done nothing wrong.

511
01:19:39,701 --> 01:19:42,436
Yeah, well, you try
telling the coppers that.

512
01:19:42,437 --> 01:19:44,471
They're talking about
changing the law again.

513
01:19:44,472 --> 01:19:46,473
Automatic 18 month
jail sentence

514
01:19:46,474 --> 01:19:51,114
for anybody supplying
a banned person with grog.

515
01:19:56,916 --> 01:19:58,416
Oh, sorry.

516
01:20:33,649 --> 01:20:34,715
A police car!

517
01:20:34,716 --> 01:20:37,356
Watch out, policemen coming!

518
01:20:49,896 --> 01:20:51,736
Where's your home?

519
01:20:51,864 --> 01:20:54,104
Where's your home, eh?

520
01:20:54,466 --> 01:20:57,506
This is our land, you bastards!

521
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:03,837
You treacherous fuck!

522
01:21:03,838 --> 01:21:04,704
Huh?

523
01:21:04,705 --> 01:21:06,706
Come on, I trusted you!

524
01:21:06,707 --> 01:21:08,708
You fuckin' turn on me,

525
01:21:08,709 --> 01:21:11,977
you fuckin' useless
black bastard!

526
01:21:11,978 --> 01:21:13,445
Fuck you!

527
01:21:13,446 --> 01:21:15,013
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

528
01:21:15,014 --> 01:21:17,015
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

529
01:21:17,016 --> 01:21:18,516
Fuck you!

530
01:21:20,318 --> 01:21:21,918
Watch your head.

531
01:21:25,322 --> 01:21:27,756
Should've hunted
you down that day, Charlie.

532
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:29,591
You know that,
but I did nothin'.

533
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:32,472
That is a big mistake by me.

534
01:21:35,463 --> 01:21:37,363
I've learned my lesson,
you know?

535
01:21:37,364 --> 01:21:38,831
You don't go soft
on a black fella,

536
01:21:38,832 --> 01:21:41,433
they take advantage of you.

537
01:21:41,434 --> 01:21:42,934
Shut up!

538
01:21:43,836 --> 01:21:45,336
Come on.

539
01:21:45,504 --> 01:21:47,004
Get in.

540
01:21:52,443 --> 01:21:55,403
Sorry for hittin' you, Charlie.

541
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:02,350
You know, you can't just
sit on the grass all day

542
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:04,919
and call it "the old ways."

543
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,320
These times have changed.

544
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:08,823
No, they haven't.

545
01:22:08,824 --> 01:22:11,091
You're still trying
to change our culture

546
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:13,412
to your bastard culture!

547
01:22:14,895 --> 01:22:16,395
Fuck you!

548
01:22:23,535 --> 01:22:26,895
In--in this particular
situation...

549
01:22:29,073 --> 01:22:32,273
moreover the defendant
in no way

550
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,570
denies the attack,

551
01:22:35,846 --> 01:22:40,246
and has shown nothing
in the way of remorse.

552
01:22:41,217 --> 01:22:44,657
I find against him
on all charges.

553
01:22:49,692 --> 01:22:52,694
Does the defendant
have anything to say

554
01:22:52,695 --> 01:22:54,375
before sentencing?

555
01:23:15,982 --> 01:23:17,982
This mean my country

556
01:23:19,952 --> 01:23:21,452
is my home.

557
01:23:44,807 --> 01:23:46,307
That means...

558
01:23:48,811 --> 01:23:51,211
I was living in my home

559
01:23:52,014 --> 01:23:53,934
nice and peacefully,

560
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:57,117
then the police came

561
01:24:00,288 --> 01:24:01,968
to throw me out.

562
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,600
That mean...

563
01:24:16,902 --> 01:24:18,902
nothing more to say.

564
01:26:48,111 --> 01:26:49,978
Attention! Attention!

565
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:52,539
All areas will report
to.

566
01:29:45,011 --> 01:29:47,011
Hard to talk to you

567
01:29:48,014 --> 01:29:50,974
when you don't look like you.

568
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:06,474
I got that license
for my rifle.

569
01:30:23,146 --> 01:30:25,580
They're teaching me here,

570
01:30:25,581 --> 01:30:27,501
then I'll go back,

571
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:31,510
and I'll work
in my own country.

572
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,570
I'm going.

573
01:31:45,187 --> 01:31:46,687
Ah, shit.

574
01:32:37,368 --> 01:32:39,035
All right,
so when you're considered

575
01:32:39,036 --> 01:32:40,236
for parole, Charlie.

576
01:32:40,237 --> 01:32:41,737
-When?
-When?

577
01:32:42,706 --> 01:32:44,540
I don't know,
not for a few months yet,

578
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:46,041
but when you are...

579
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:47,542
where do you think
you might go?

580
01:32:47,543 --> 01:32:49,043
I don't know.

581
01:32:50,546 --> 01:32:52,046
Somewhere.

582
01:32:53,415 --> 01:32:55,682
What about going back
to your community?

583
01:32:55,683 --> 01:32:58,403
You can live
your own way.

584
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,219
No.

585
01:33:01,555 --> 01:33:06,025
White fellas locked me up
for being aboriginal.

586
01:33:06,026 --> 01:33:10,746
I wanted to live in
the white fella's way now.

587
01:33:42,323 --> 01:33:43,823
Fucking...

588
01:34:27,297 --> 01:34:29,631
You're gonna
report to me weekly.

589
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:32,233
You're gonna
show up on time.

590
01:34:32,234 --> 01:34:34,435
And another condition
is that you'll be banned

591
01:34:34,436 --> 01:34:35,702
from buying alcohol.

592
01:34:35,703 --> 01:34:37,470
I'm giving up drinking anyway.

593
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:38,771
That's good.

594
01:34:38,772 --> 01:34:40,439
And you won't be allowed
to associate

595
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,840
with known drinkers.

596
01:34:41,841 --> 01:34:46,081
Everyone in this country
are known drinkers.

597
01:34:46,312 --> 01:34:49,547
Yeah, this means
known to the police.

598
01:34:49,548 --> 01:34:52,028
Police are known drinkers.

599
01:34:52,717 --> 01:34:56,152
Tell them not
to associate with me.

600
01:34:56,153 --> 01:34:57,753
Okay, all right.

601
01:34:58,188 --> 01:34:59,555
I'm gonna arrange
for you to stay

602
01:34:59,556 --> 01:35:01,623
at a dry house
for the first month.

603
01:35:01,624 --> 01:35:04,192
It's not the easiest
of places, Charlie.

604
01:35:04,193 --> 01:35:05,226
But given what you want,

605
01:35:05,227 --> 01:35:07,867
that's the best I can do.

606
01:36:53,398 --> 01:36:55,878
I want to go home now...

607
01:36:57,735 --> 01:37:00,455
...back to my own country...

608
01:37:03,307 --> 01:37:05,547
...where my place is...

609
01:39:29,512 --> 01:39:32,632
Same old junk,
same old prices.

610
01:39:35,484 --> 01:39:38,284
Where's all the decent food?

611
01:39:39,754 --> 01:39:43,674
The food in prison
is better than this.

612
01:39:44,457 --> 01:39:46,377
Ah, doesn't matter.

613
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,615
What are you doing
in the bush?

614
01:40:12,616 --> 01:40:15,096
You know I like it here.

615
01:40:16,786 --> 01:40:20,626
I had to get this ranger
to find you.

616
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:25,690
He's always finding me
in the bush.

617
01:40:26,894 --> 01:40:30,654
How come you don't
answer your phone?

618
01:40:31,798 --> 01:40:33,298
Old number.

619
01:40:37,136 --> 01:40:39,856
What's the new number then?

620
01:40:40,139 --> 01:40:42,139
Only got old number.

621
01:40:54,151 --> 01:40:58,791
You going to come
and teach the kids to dance?

622
01:41:00,657 --> 01:41:02,157
No...not me...

623
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:06,661
...get Bobby
to teach those kids.

624
01:41:06,662 --> 01:41:08,796
He knows how to do it.

625
01:41:08,797 --> 01:41:10,297
Bobby's crook.

626
01:41:11,466 --> 01:41:13,306
His lungs are bad.

627
01:41:15,602 --> 01:41:18,322
Yeah, Bobby smokes too much.

628
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:26,142
They've taken him
to hospital in Darwin.

629
01:41:57,375 --> 01:41:59,615
Okay, I'll teach them.

630
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:04,046
I'd like to do it.

631
01:42:04,047 --> 01:42:05,547
Me.

632
01:42:08,283 --> 01:42:09,783
Yeah.

633
01:42:13,287 --> 01:42:15,527
I went from this land,

634
01:42:15,989 --> 01:42:17,489
by myself.

635
01:42:19,192 --> 01:42:22,072
Not just me,
other boys too.

636
01:42:24,163 --> 01:42:27,283
We went far,
all the way to...

637
01:42:29,134 --> 01:42:30,634
Sydney.

638
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:35,010
We danced there,
all the boys.

639
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:37,560
Dancing...for...

640
01:42:41,311 --> 01:42:43,711
Queen Elizabeth...Queen...

641
01:42:45,148 --> 01:42:47,388
...from England, London.

642
01:42:48,017 --> 01:42:49,857
I've danced there!

643
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:54,188
For the opening
of the Opera House

644
01:42:54,189 --> 01:42:56,390
and the Queen was there too.

645
01:42:56,391 --> 01:42:58,631
Me, and all them boys.

646
01:42:59,794 --> 01:43:01,895
Number one didgeridoo player,

647
01:43:01,896 --> 01:43:05,016
and number one
clapstick player.

648
01:43:06,199 --> 01:43:07,699
Very big.

649
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:11,761
Many, many people were there...

650
01:43:12,171 --> 01:43:14,091
at the Opera House.

651
01:43:16,908 --> 01:43:19,948
Do you want to give it a try?

652
01:43:21,178 --> 01:43:23,098
I'll show you, eh?
