1
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,322
- It's lucky it didn't reach the house.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:57,783 --> 00:00:59,333
You know,

3
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,186
there's gonna be a lot more jobs at
that factory in Milwaukee come June.

4
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:08,867
- I could put in a word.
- You can't leave us, Henry.

5
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,922
She needs us both.

6
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,818
Can you stop being a momma's boy
for one second?

7
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:17,768
I'm not trying to hurt you,
but Jesus,

8
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:20,010
you got to live
your own life sometime.

9
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:22,614
That woman can take care
of her own goddamn...

10
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,907
Oh, good evening.

11
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,018
Brother has been killing brother
since Cain and Abel,

12
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:43,417
yet even I didn't see that coming.

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,022
I was as blind-sided as poor
old Henry down there.

14
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:51,638
Apparently the authorities
shared my naiveté.

15
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:55,021
In other words,
they believed the young man's story

16
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:58,085
that Henry fell,
hit his head on a stone,

17
00:01:58,106 --> 00:02:01,438
and died of smoke asphyxiation.

18
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:05,994
On the other hand,
if they hadn't believed him,

19
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:10,473
Ed Gein would never have had
the opportunity to commit those

20
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:15,371
heinous crimes
for which he became most famous.

21
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:21,033
And we, of course, well...
We wouldn't have our little movie, would we?

22
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:26,797
Sync, corrected by icephoenix

23
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:41,343
Here he comes!

24
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,575
This thing's going to be gigantic.

25
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,264
I wish I had 20% of the take.

26
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:53,244
Does tonight's incredible reaction surprise you,
Mr. Hitchcock?

27
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:56,148
No, when I was planning
North by Northwest

28
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:59,950
I could already hear the
screams and the laughter.

29
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:04,198
Any questions, my dear?
Pity.

30
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,914
Mr. Hitchcock,
you've directed 46 motion pictures.

31
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,321
You're the most famous director
in the history of the medium...

32
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:12,810
But you're sixty years old.

33
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,023
Shouldn't you just quit
while you're ahead?

34
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:35,748
Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms
gouged out with arrows.

35
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:38,791
That must have been rather painful.

36
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,858
Talking of arrows,

37
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:45,963
did you read that little snippet
from A.H. Weiler's review in The New York Times?

38
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:49,822
He said he found the climax
to be "overdrawn."

39
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,535
Yes, well I doubt Mr. Weiler has
had a climax in years.

40
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:57,820
"North by Northwest
reminds us of Mr. Hitchcock's

41
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:01,474
earlier, more inventive spy thrillers."

42
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:04,010
And there is an accompanying list.

43
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:08,166
The "New Masters of Suspense."

44
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,851
Why do they keep looking for new ones
when they still have the original?

45
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:14,666
Oh, don't be maudlin,
you know how much it aggravates me.

46
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,559
Just stop reading them.

47
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:18,440
You've been reading them for a week.

48
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,045
Tell me, my dear,

49
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,466
do you think I'm too old?

50
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:28,252
Yes, you're a true relic.

51
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:31,425
And lest we forget,
a notably corpulent one.

52
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:36,843
You always know precisely
where to plunge the dagger, don't you?

53
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:39,948
Right between the shoulder blades.
I learned it from your pictures.

54
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:42,755
Where, may I ask,
are you off to?

55
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:44,704
I'm going to have brunch with Whit

56
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:47,353
after I drop you off at the studio.
Would you care to join us?

57
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:50,162
We've just established that
I'm far too corpulent

58
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:52,275
to be seen in broad daylight.

59
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:55,064
Oh, you'll feel better when
you find a new project.

60
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,730
Hasn't Peggy unearthed any
decent books for you recently?

61
00:04:57,753 --> 00:05:00,788
Yes, sleeping pills with dust jackets.

62
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,911
So what do you think?

63
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:08,198
Very presentable.

64
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:13,781
Hurry up, dear, you're pruning.

65
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,082
- Good Morning.
- Ms. Hitchcock.

66
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:28,796
Mr. Hitchcock.

67
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,424
Sirs.

68
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:42,117
There's a project out there waiting for you,
Hitch. I promise you.

69
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,474
- I hope so. Thank you, love.
- Have a good day.

70
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:53,290
I'm treading water, Peggy.
I need something fresh, something different.

71
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:56,403
Without expensive stars to pretty it up.

72
00:05:56,427 --> 00:06:00,544
Fox is offering you
The Diary of Anne Frank for the third time.

73
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:03,458
The audience would spend the entire
picture waiting for Miss Frank

74
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:06,280
to discover the corpse
I'd hidden in the attic.

75
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:08,614
- Wouldn't you agree, Nuncio?
- Si.

76
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:11,945
MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book,
Casino Royale.

77
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,540
Cary Grant.
Definitely your style.

78
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:18,431
Doesn't she know I just made that movie?
It's called North by Northwest.

79
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:21,279
"Style," my dear, is mere self-plagiarism.

80
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:23,826
Oh, scusi!

81
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,736
A nice, clean, nasty little piece of work.
That's what I'm looking for.

82
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,118
I shall see what I can find.

83
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:34,816
- Serves you right.
- Yeah.

84
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:38,665
You know, Hitch always says that
your private life

85
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,623
is in danger of being more entertaining
than any of your plots.

86
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:45,034
I'm surprised he let me have you
for the whole afternoon.

87
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:47,287
Especially looking so beautiful.

88
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:50,880
So tell me,
what are you working on these days?

89
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:53,289
Me? Oh, oh...

90
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,685
I'm satisfied working in my garden.

91
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,800
Oh!
Well that's one lucky garden.

92
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:05,140
All this relentless sycophancy is
actually giving me indigestion.

93
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:07,806
What are you after?

94
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:14,627
I was hoping you may be able to apply
your considerable pruning skills to this.

95
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,918
Ah, all is finally revealed.

96
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:23,181
Whit, you are a little predictable.

97
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:28,042
The most fun I ever had
was working with you.

98
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:47,879
Anything come up, my dear?
Anything at all?

99
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,828
Nothing suitable.

100
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:52,111
Is that water
or do I need to call Alma?

101
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,967
Do whatever you want.

102
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,532
Anthony Boucher says that
this book Psycho by Robert Bloch is

103
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:04,281
"fiendishly entertaining."

104
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:06,715
It sounds ghastly.
Everyone in town's already passed.

105
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:08,699
And who is everyone, pray?

106
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:12,468
The story department finished the
coverage this morning.

107
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,839
This about Ed Gein,
the mass murderer from Wisconsin?

108
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:19,591
Oh, yeah.

109
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:25,849
"Graphic elements of brutal violence,
voyeurism, transvestitism and incest."

110
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:31,146
Very nice. Not your average
run-of-the-mill nutcase, is he?

111
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,334
You're kidding.

112
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:36,805
Peggy, this is the boy
who dug up his own mother.

113
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:51,862
- Hungry?
- Famished.

114
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:55,019
You can have half a grapefruit later
if you're good.

115
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,956
Listen, Hitch.

116
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,223
Whit gave me the galleys to his new book
yesterday at lunch.

117
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:03,123
I've already got some ideas
about how we can adapt it.

118
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:06,329
It's elegant. It's sophisticated.
It's full of intrigue.

119
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:09,454
You mean the book or Mr. Whitfield Cook?

120
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:13,771
This could be the one, Hitch.

121
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:17,535
I'll read it later.

122
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:22,323
There are calories in that, you know.

123
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,887
Ma?

124
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:42,401
Ma...

125
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,869
Aren't you cold?

126
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:15,243
No need to be afraid, Ma.

127
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:27,123
Oh, God!

128
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:31,912
I just want you to read
this little bit here.

129
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:35,951
It takes place in the motel bathroom.

130
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:38,206
"Mary started to scream,

131
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:40,562
"and then the curtains parted further

132
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:44,147
"and a hand appeared,
holding a butcher's knife.

133
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:46,824
"It was the knife that,
a moment later,

134
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:50,222
cut off her scream,
and her head."

135
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,213
Charming.
Doris Day should do it as a musical.

136
00:10:55,237 --> 00:11:00,142
That is nothing but low-budget
horror movie claptrap.

137
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:07,276
But what if someone really good
made a horror picture?

138
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,672
Just think of the shock value.

139
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:16,121
Killing off your leading lady
halfway through.

140
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:21,288
I mean, you are intrigued,
are you not, my dear?

141
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:24,751
Come on, admit it.

142
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:27,064
Admit it.

143
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,847
Actually,
I think it's a huge mistake.

144
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:37,146
You shouldn't wait till halfway through.
Kill her off after thirty minutes.

145
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:41,882
Well!

146
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:46,360
Peggy,
I want you to summon your minions.

147
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:49,131
- Minions?
- Right away.

148
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:52,343
Certainly.
And who might they be?

149
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:56,100
Get them started buying copies of Psycho.

150
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:59,618
- How many do you need?
- All of them. Every copy, nationwide.

151
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:02,906
Scour every bookshop, every library.
And I mean everywhere.

152
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,879
Psycho is going to be my next movie,

153
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:08,417
and I don't want anyone to know the ending
until they see it in the theater.

154
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:13,210
Look at that.

155
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:20,976
Are you sure about this?
This is so unlike you.

156
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,048
That is exactly the point, my dear.

157
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:31,119
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

158
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:36,350
good afternoon.

159
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,041
I see you've all been devouring
the article on Mr. Ed Gein.

160
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,670
Violent chap,

161
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:48,457
and the real-life inspiration
behind Psycho.

162
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:53,686
All of us harbor
dark recesses of violence,

163
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,633
and horror.

164
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:59,573
Fascinating, isn't it?

165
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:05,045
When the Wisconsin Police Department
raided Mr. Gein's farm,

166
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:09,464
they opened the door...
And voila!

167
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:15,137
They discovered ten female heads
with the tops sawn off.

168
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,987
Pass these around, would you?
And have a look.

169
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,476
Masks of human skin.

170
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,284
A pair of lips on a drawstring
for a window shade.

171
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:27,037
Oh, yes, and a jug
containing human noses.

172
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,606
Is this really going to be your next picture,
Mr. Hitchcock?

173
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,138
Well, that is my intention,
yes, madam.

174
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:38,844
My only wish is that Ed Gein looked a little more
like William Holden instead of Elmer Fudd.

175
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:46,074
By the way, try the finger sandwiches.
They're real fingers.

176
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:50,522
Bloody hell!

177
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,647
Now don't pretend you're
not upset he hasn't read it.

178
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,744
I'm not.
I'm a big boy, I can take it.

179
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,529
Well, I loved it.

180
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:59,657
It must be great fun to research.

181
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:02,339
Do you really think he will read it?

182
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:05,075
Ah, speak of the devil.

183
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:09,161
Hitch, I ran all over town
trying to find a copy of Psycho

184
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:11,415
but I simply cannot find one.

185
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:16,029
- I wonder how that could have happened.
- Yeah.

186
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,818
Don't stop looking on my behalf.

187
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:21,354
Hitch, you should come.

188
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:31,033
I've seen happier faces on a school bus
going over a cliff.

189
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:37,453
But they can't stop looking,
can they?

190
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:46,047
Audiences want to be shocked,
Barney.

191
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:48,642
They want something different.

192
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,286
And this is it.

193
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,726
Every time you want to do
something different

194
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:58,185
like The Wrong Man or Vertigo,
someone loses money.

195
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,498
So we should stop trying to
give them something new?

196
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,718
You owe Paramount one last picture,
Hitch.

197
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:07,771
Can't you do something like
North by Northwest

198
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:11,163
but for us this time
instead of for MGM?

199
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:15,956
Psycho.

200
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:22,673
No one respects
the name Hitchcock like Paramount.

201
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:28,894
Are you telling me "no," Barney?

202
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,923
I think you know me better than that,
Hitch.

203
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,879
What a putz.

204
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:39,251
You know what his family did
before they built those movie palaces?

205
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:41,440
Ran a grocery store.

206
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:45,491
My father ran a grocery store.

207
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:49,252
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.
He should show some respect.

208
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:54,731
They think I've lost my touch, Lew.

209
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:58,923
My association with television has
cheapened me.

210
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:01,071
Are you referring to that deal I got you

211
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:04,873
where Bristol-Meyers pays you 29 grand
an episode and you own the negative?

212
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,296
That's my kind of cheap.

213
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:11,151
They just want the same thing
over and over and over.

214
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:14,880
They've put me in a coffin and
now they're nailing down the lid.

215
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:19,065
Hitch, as your agent,
I will never let that happen.

216
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:26,989
How much you think you can
make this picture for?

217
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:29,770
$800,000, give or take.

218
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,920
You're home early.

219
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,192
Oh, it's lovely actually.

220
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,330
You know, I'm disappointed
you didn't give Whit's book a chance.

221
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:04,498
And what about Whit?
Is he disappointed?

222
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,846
Oh, no.
He knows you well enough.

223
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:10,814
Look at that!
Time for a new one anyway.

224
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:14,233
Well you'd better enjoy the pool,
my dear, while you can.

225
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,311
We might not have it much longer.

226
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:21,732
Why?

227
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:24,889
Paramount refuses to finance the movie.

228
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:28,487
Oh, Hitch, I'm so sorry.

229
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:33,024
Lew can't find the money.
At least, not fast enough.

230
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,558
Well why not wait?

231
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:38,070
No.

232
00:17:40,712 --> 00:17:45,811
Just going to have to go it alone,
old girl.

233
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:48,209
Finance it ourselves.

234
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,019
Are we going to have to sell
the whole house or just the pool?

235
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:03,571
I just want to do the film.

236
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,223
I will ask you this once
and I'll never mention it again.

237
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:16,857
Why this one, Hitch?

238
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,573
It's not just because so many people
are saying "no," is it?

239
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:28,165
Do you remember the fun we had
when we started out all those years ago?

240
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:32,249
We didn't have any money then, did we?

241
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,753
We didn't have any time, either,
but we took risks, do you remember?

242
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:44,920
We experimented.
We invented new ways of making pictures

243
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:47,430
because we had to.

244
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:56,206
I want to feel
that kind of freedom again.

245
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,414
Like we used to, you know?

246
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:13,694
We are about to propose
a restructured deal for Psycho.

247
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:16,031
I'm listening.

248
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:20,312
We finance it independently.

249
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:25,518
Hitch waives his directorial fee.
Paramount only distributes it,

250
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:29,203
in exchange for 40% of the profits.

251
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:34,440
Interesting. But what exactly
is Paramount distributing?

252
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:38,790
Is this still a picture about a queer
killing people in his mother's dress?

253
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:42,690
What this picture is about
is the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock.

254
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:46,283
- No one is arguing that.
- Barney,

255
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:49,488
it's very simple.

256
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:52,545
This is Mr. Hitchcock's next film.

257
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:57,142
Are you in or are you out?

258
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:06,312
Fine. We'll take that deal.

259
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,895
If you can get the money.

260
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,018
We already have the money, Barney.

261
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,991
Who do I make it out to?

262
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:32,357
If this picture fails, Alma,

263
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:37,500
we'll be in for a long,
humiliating bout of crow-eating.

264
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:44,720
- It'll be splendid.
- Are you sure?

265
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:49,871
Of the movie? Not at all.

266
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:54,291
But of you? Unquestionably.

267
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,100
Ahem.

268
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,738
- Joe Stefano. Good to meet you.
- Sit down.

269
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:08,323
I'm sorry I was late.

270
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,542
My shrink session went overtime.

271
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:16,701
I see him every day
and it's still not enough.

272
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:20,511
I thought it was only director's assistants
who needed psychiatrists,

273
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:22,730
not writers.

274
00:21:27,143 --> 00:21:29,467
Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock?

275
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:32,228
I have to confess, Mr. Stefano,

276
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:34,846
It boggles my brain
just trying to imagine

277
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,863
what you and your shrink
could possibly talk about every day.

278
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:45,206
The usual: Sex. Rage. My mother.

279
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:57,466
Good morning, sir.

280
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:01,091
Let me have a look at you.

281
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:05,920
The only thing worse than
a visit to the dentist is a visit to censor.

282
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:08,855
Whatever you do, Hitch,
don't lose your temper.

283
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,382
- See you later.
- Good luck.

284
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:18,975
The Code will absolutely not permit you

285
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:22,227
to show a knife
penetrating a woman's flesh.

286
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,056
I assure you, Geoffrey,

287
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,317
my murders are always models of taste
and discretion.

288
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:32,954
Is there any improper
suggestion of nudity in this

289
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,223
murder scene in the shower?

290
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:39,335
She won't be nude.
She'll be wearing a shower cap.

291
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:47,659
We might accept a shot
from outside the bathroom window

292
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:50,042
of Marion in silhouette
above the shoulders.

293
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,848
Provided that the glass is frosted.

294
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:55,281
Thank you.

295
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:59,647
And the scene with the toilet.

296
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,118
It is completely necessary
to show the toilet,

297
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:05,602
because Marion Crane attempts
to flush evidence down it.

298
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:08,615
Remnants of which are later
discovered by her sister.

299
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:14,641
These remnants, you understand,
are clues to her vanishing.

300
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:19,505
No American movie has ever found it
necessary to show a toilet,

301
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,818
let alone to flush one.

302
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:24,935
Perhaps we ought to
shoot the film in France

303
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,540
and use a bidet instead.

304
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:36,003
Mr. Hitchcock,
if this office denies you a seal,

305
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:38,569
and we're certainly heading
in that direction,

306
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:44,159
your movie will not be released
in a single theater in this country.

307
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:47,086
Will you be making jokes then?

308
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:52,877
Everyone in Hollywood resents me.

309
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:55,255
I make them millions of dollars,

310
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,058
and every year I sit at those
dreadful award show dinners,

311
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:04,205
waiting for someone just to say,
"You're good."

312
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:11,835
They take sadistic pleasure in
denying me that one little moment.

313
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,981
That must hurt.

314
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,954
Deeply, Ed. Deeply.

315
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:27,521
Sorry, doctor.
I'm just not used to this...

316
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,434
process.

317
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:35,158
Just think of me more like a friend.

318
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:39,385
It's just that more and more
I've been having these...

319
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:40,571
impulses.

320
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:48,104
What kind of impulses?

321
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,749
Strong ones.

322
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,028
Here.

323
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:19,492
The Lazar Office tell me
he's crazy to work with you.

324
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:23,543
Tell Swifty Lazar he should not have
overexposed his client on television.

325
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:26,164
Unlike some we could mention.

326
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:31,867
- Anthony Perkins.
- Oh...

327
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:35,106
Think of the duality
he could bring to the role of Norman.

328
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:37,697
The rage lurking behind that
little boy grin.

329
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:41,339
The winsome charm he uses
to keep from being found out.

330
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:45,859
Why, Alma,
you're not suggesting Mr. Perkins is...?

331
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:47,562
Hm.

332
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:50,745
What?

333
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,829
I like your office.

334
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:06,680
I can't count how many times
I've seen Strangers on a Train.

335
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,476
And Rope.

336
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:15,012
Well, Norman Bates is the logical extension
of those two characters in that movie.

337
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:18,873
Appealing, sensitive,
suffering the terrible burden

338
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:22,430
of being forced to pretend to be
something he is not.

339
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:30,362
I'm sick of all this romantic crap
the studios keep shoving me into.

340
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:33,262
But my only worry is,

341
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:36,589
well, playing Norman might
cut too close to home.

342
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,070
How so?

343
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:49,417
When I was younger,
I was incredibly close to my mother.

344
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,759
So close that I remember
wishing my father would drop dead.

345
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:59,669
And then when I was five,
he did just that.

346
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:01,970
He keeled over from a heart attack.

347
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:12,681
You see I've been guilty my whole life,
Mr. Hitchcock.

348
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:20,775
You know,
I'm getting blisters just watching you.

349
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,337
Oh, stop complaining.

350
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,261
A bit of fresh air and exercise
will do you good.

351
00:27:25,284 --> 00:27:28,945
- I'm going to have a drink.
- No you're not. You're going to finish that hedge.

352
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,667
You've got to go all the way around there,
all the way around there, all the way around there.

353
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,996
- It's impossible. I can't do that.
- Yes you can.

354
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,274
You know, I was thinking,
if I could get Grace Kelly to play the girl,

355
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:43,458
they'd let me get away with murder.

356
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:47,433
Well you can't. She's a princess now,
which makes her permanently unattainable.

357
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,758
And all the more desirable.

358
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:53,283
What about Deborah Kerr?
Lew mentioned her.

359
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:55,440
No, she's too Scottish.

360
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:59,527
What about Janet Leigh?

361
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:03,807
I know she's normally the "good girl,"
but she was awfully good in Touch of Evil.

362
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:08,230
You remember how you always used to
remark on her figure at the Wassermans' parties?

363
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,401
Yeah.

364
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,188
- Good evening.
- Hello.

365
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,105
- Lovely to see you.
- Charmed.

366
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:23,124
- Hi.
- Hello, Janet. How are you?

367
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:25,062
Wonderful to see you.

368
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:28,918
- Well, my dear, you look very beautiful.
- Thank you.

369
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:30,996
Very beautiful.

370
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:39,300
Of course the real secret of Mrs. Simpson's
appeal to the Duke of Windsor

371
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:43,132
was that she could make a toothpick
feel like a cigar.

372
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:47,674
Oh, I've been so immersed
in preparing to play Marion

373
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:50,121
I'd almost forgotten how to laugh.

374
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:51,512
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

375
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:54,889
Now, now, you must try
the banana shortcake.

376
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:57,791
Oh, no. Nothing for me, thank you.
I'm watching my figure.

377
00:28:57,815 --> 00:29:00,755
Yes, you're not the only one.
We're fine, thank you.

378
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,567
George, bring her the banana shortcake.

379
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:05,984
In fact, make that two large portions.
Thank you.

380
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:10,381
Now tell me, my dear, how else have you
prepared for the part of Marion Crane?

381
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:12,859
Well, I've written an entire history
for her,

382
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:16,457
which seems a little silly, I know,
but it really does help.

383
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,099
- It doesn't sound silly at all.
- No?

384
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:22,648
Why don't you tell us
one of her deepest secrets?

385
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:28,360
Well, she leads a double life.

386
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:31,824
At the Lowery Office,
she wears Tweed perfume.

387
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:34,172
But when she's with Sam,

388
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:38,775
she recklessly breaks out
her most expensive bottle.

389
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,170
"My Sin" by Lanvin.

390
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:43,874
- "My Sin"?
- Yes.

391
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:45,861
Good Lord!

392
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,643
I do have a concern or two.

393
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:52,892
I'm an actress, of course,
but I'm first a wife and a mother.

394
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,145
And I'm just curious to know...

395
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:58,894
How are you going to shoot
this shower scene?

396
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:01,642
Yes, you and the Shurlock Office.

397
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:06,843
It's only that, well, from here up,
I'm not exactly boyish.

398
00:30:06,867 --> 00:30:10,079
Allow me to set your mind at rest,
my dear.

399
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:13,578
I will be shooting short bits of film
from various angles.

400
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:17,693
Cut together, the montage
will only suggest nudity.

401
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,124
Suggest violence.

402
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:21,533
Nothing will actually be shown.

403
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:25,545
But of course,
having you in the shower

404
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:29,807
would make it all the more,
well, titillating.

405
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:33,351
Will you excuse me?

406
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:51,508
Alma, dear,
how lovely to see you.

407
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:53,986
Oh, hello, Lillian.

408
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:55,829
You're looking a little pale.

409
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:59,194
No wonder with that thing
your husband's working on now.

410
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:01,426
You can't possibly approve.

411
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,623
Why are you letting him do
something so tasteless?

412
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:08,314
Don't upset yourself, darling.
It's only a bloody movie.

413
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:29,159
I can't believe
you made Vera Miles play the sister.

414
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:32,998
Well, I've still got her under contract.
May as well get something out of her.

415
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:35,786
Rather a thankless role,
don't you think?

416
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:38,660
For an utterly thankless girl.

417
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:53,229
Horrible.

418
00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:55,977
The old man really is unhappy with me,
isn't he?

419
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,779
Wait till you see the undergarments
he has picked out for you.

420
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:05,091
Okay. Well, I am just going to
have to keep telling myself,

421
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:08,854
one more picture
and I'm free as a bird.

422
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,465
So I've made a list of places
where we can tighten our belts.

423
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:28,256
Huh?

424
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:32,460
We could all learn the art of self-restraint,
couldn't we, Alfred?

425
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:37,970
Gardeners once a week,
weekend off for the driver...

426
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:41,287
No, that's impossible.
We'll have to find other places to cut.

427
00:32:41,311 --> 00:32:43,131
There aren't any other places.

428
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:47,333
And there's be no more shipments
flown in from Maxim's of Paris.

429
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:49,700
We can't afford it.

430
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:52,618
The foie gras at Chasen's
is more than adequate.

431
00:32:52,642 --> 00:32:56,653
But those geese are from Barstow,
not from Marseilles.

432
00:32:56,677 --> 00:33:01,878
Yes, well we all have to make our sacrifices
for the greater good, don't we, Alfred?

433
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:37,989
I'll go get the knives.

434
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,729
Am I making a terrible mistake?

435
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,691
What if it's another Vertigo?

436
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,234
Just get the first take under your belt.
You'll be fine.

437
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,776
Are you decent, my dear?

438
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:29,107
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

439
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:31,766
Am I all right?

440
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,807
- Perfect.
- Wow.

441
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:36,439
- Morning.
- Morning.

442
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:39,313
I want to thank you once again
for this opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.

443
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:41,412
You may call me "Hitch."
Hold the cock.

444
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:44,699
Well look at you two.
America's favorite boy and girl next door.

445
00:34:44,723 --> 00:34:46,917
Yes, and we're about to move
to a whole new neighborhood.

446
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,899
- Morning, Janet. Morning, Tony.
- Morning, Vera.

447
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,482
- Thanks for the wardrobe, Hitch.
- Do you approve?

448
00:34:52,505 --> 00:34:54,343
You're the genius.

449
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:57,194
One thing, though.
My script is missing its last ten pages.

450
00:34:57,217 --> 00:35:01,659
Everyone's script is missing ten pages
until Alma finishes the revisions.

451
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,019
You're just in time for the Oath.

452
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:07,571
- The what?
- The Oath.

453
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:10,765
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

454
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:14,029
Would you all raise your right hands?

455
00:35:14,053 --> 00:35:16,378
That includes you, Vera Miles.

456
00:35:19,138 --> 00:35:22,379
- I do solemnly promise...
- I do solemnly promise...

457
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:25,955
- That I will not divulge...
- That I will not divulge...

458
00:35:25,979 --> 00:35:32,399
- The plot nor the many secrets of Psycho...
- The plot nor the many secrets of Psycho...

459
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:36,309
- To friends, relatives...
- To friends, relatives...

460
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,771
- Trade reporters...
- Trade reporters...

461
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:43,053
Not even outgoing
President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

462
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:44,741
Thank you all very much.

463
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:34,673
Here we are, Norman's inner sanctum.

464
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:41,692
Now, Hitch.

465
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:46,201
Explain to me
why I'm watching Marion undress?

466
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,044
I feel like I should
take offense at that.

467
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:51,005
Perhaps Norman
secretly watched his mother

468
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:54,233
preparing for her nightly bath.

469
00:37:54,256 --> 00:37:57,168
Yes, maybe there was a transom
over the bathroom door?

470
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,868
Yeah, which he could access
by climbing on a chair,

471
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:04,120
so long as he was stealthy.

472
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:07,748
A boy's first glimpse of a naked woman
is usually his mother.

473
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,067
So I'm reliving the past,

474
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:14,505
repeating a ritual with Marion?

475
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,442
Don't ask me.

476
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:21,363
I'm just a man hiding in the corner
with my camera, watching.

477
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:25,575
My camera will tell you the truth.
The absolute truth.

478
00:38:27,324 --> 00:38:29,168
Hitch, I have a question.

479
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:32,480
Why is the hole
so much larger on this side?

480
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:35,187
All the better to see you with,
my dear.

481
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:39,477
At the greatest possible angle.

482
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,757
And cut!

483
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,231
If you ask me, the credits should read

484
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:30,338
"Screenplay by Joseph Stefano
and Alma Reville."

485
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,840
The people who matter know.

486
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:41,340
Alma, you always know the answer.
Is this really going to work?

487
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,953
See you tomorrow.

488
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,394
Hello, stranger.

489
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:09,434
- Whit!
- Where have you been hiding?

490
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:11,512
Oh, God...!

491
00:40:11,524 --> 00:40:14,424
- I've been finishing the revisions on...
- Psycho.

492
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:17,160
- Mm-hmm.
- And how is the old boy?

493
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:21,439
He is in a state of unbridled ecstasy
now that he's back on the set.

494
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,517
And you? How are you?

495
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:29,659
Well, two thousand words to do
for Reader's Digest on

496
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:33,018
what it's like to be married to
a man obsessed by murder.

497
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:39,578
Alma, you deserve a break.

498
00:40:40,603 --> 00:40:42,599
Let's drive up to Santa Barbara.

499
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:46,620
We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy steaks
that we love so much at El Encanto.

500
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:50,794
Mr. Hitchcock,
we're ready for you on the set.

501
00:40:55,096 --> 00:40:58,836
- Mr. Hitchcock.
- I'll be there in a moment.

502
00:41:22,765 --> 00:41:25,228
Long line at the supermarket?

503
00:41:28,226 --> 00:41:30,894
No. Actually,
I'm home earlier than I expected.

504
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:39,243
- Would you like a cocktail?
- No, and you shouldn't have one either.

505
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,684
- That hasn't been washed yet.
- I don't care.

506
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:58,102
Oh, I was filming all day today
with John Gavin.

507
00:41:58,126 --> 00:42:00,529
He's a good-looking chap.

508
00:42:00,544 --> 00:42:04,017
But really,
plywood is more expressive.

509
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:07,916
I think his love scene with Janet Leigh

510
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,693
may be most horrifying thing
in the movie.

511
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,205
Even your friend Mr. Whitfield Cook

512
00:42:18,206 --> 00:42:20,793
would be better in the scene.

513
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:25,528
Why don't you tell him yourself?
I'm sure he'd be very flattered.

514
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,244
You know, my dear,

515
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:44,681
maybe I was a bit too dismissive
about your friend

516
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:47,688
Whitfield's book.

517
00:42:48,885 --> 00:42:54,232
Perhaps he and Elizabeth
could come over this weekend

518
00:42:54,255 --> 00:42:56,755
and walk me through it,
as they say.

519
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,654
Lovely woman, Elizabeth.

520
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:10,054
I was hoping you could
come to the set tomorrow.

521
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:15,012
Yes. Well,
I'll see how my day shapes up.

522
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:18,035
Yes.

523
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:27,491
You think you can get away with it,
don't you? But you can't.

524
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:30,229
You think they can't tell,
but they can.

525
00:43:30,253 --> 00:43:32,162
They know.

526
00:43:32,186 --> 00:43:36,988
You can feel that noose tightening
around that breakable little neck.

527
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:38,993
I mean,
you could return the money secretly,

528
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:41,165
but what would that prove?
It's too late.

529
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:43,999
Marion Crane always so tight,
so respectable,

530
00:43:44,023 --> 00:43:47,713
so prim and so proper and perfect.
Untouchable unsullied Miss Crane.

531
00:43:47,737 --> 00:43:50,107
Daddy's perfect little angel.

532
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:55,080
Now they all know those dirty
little secrets you've been hiding so long.

533
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:57,151
Messy, sticky little lunchtime trysts

534
00:43:57,175 --> 00:44:01,458
with that oh-so-handsome failure
Mr. Samuel Loomis.

535
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:03,823
They'll smirk, they'll gossip,
and they'll whisper.

536
00:44:03,846 --> 00:44:07,333
Even your boss, straight-laced,
hatchet-faced Mr. George Lowery,

537
00:44:07,357 --> 00:44:12,538
why even he can smell the rancid,
pungent scent of sex all over you.

538
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,750
All right. Circle that and print it.

539
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:17,905
Let's get this thing fixed
once and for all.

540
00:44:17,928 --> 00:44:20,277
I'm sick and tired of it.
Come on.

541
00:44:22,145 --> 00:44:24,199
Why's it making that noise?

542
00:44:24,223 --> 00:44:27,992
- What's it going to take to reset?
- About five.

543
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,308
Come in.

544
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:41,417
Thought you could use a little
pick-me-up.

545
00:44:41,441 --> 00:44:43,921
- Oh, you're so sweet. Thank you.
- Not at all.

546
00:44:43,944 --> 00:44:46,707
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

547
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:50,546
I can't imagine your husband will be
too pleased with what just happened.

548
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,017
Well, you know.

549
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,248
Tony and the kids, you'd be surprised
what comes out of their mouths sometimes.

550
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:58,370
That's true.

551
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:01,890
You haven't spoken to him
much about your personal life, have you?

552
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:05,475
Hitch?
No, not really.

553
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:09,107
I'd keep it that way
if I were you.

554
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:14,950
Why?

555
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:18,553
Well, it starts with him
wanting to choose your hairstyle.

556
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:20,539
Then he wants to
choose your clothes,

557
00:45:20,563 --> 00:45:23,917
and your friends,
and how many children you should have.

558
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:30,084
You know that poor, tortured soul
Jimmy Stewart played in Vertigo?

559
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:32,503
That's Hitch...

560
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:35,091
Only younger,
slimmer and better-looking.

561
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:37,275
Oh, I don't know.

562
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:39,577
Compared to Orson Welles,
he's a sweetheart.

563
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,403
See?
He's always watching.

564
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:34,609
- Jack, how long is this going to take?
- Just need five minutes.

565
00:46:34,632 --> 00:46:36,673
Let's get a move on it.
We haven't got all day.

566
00:46:36,685 --> 00:46:39,139
Why does it keep
burning out all the time?

567
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:43,070
- Get it fixed. What's the hold-up?
- It's still engaged.

568
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,823
Hitch,
I'm stuck on Lila's first scene.

569
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:49,260
I don't know how strongly
I should confront Sam and the detective...

570
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:53,316
Darling, just fake it. Fake it.
You know how to do that. Act.

571
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,618
Where are my revisions?

572
00:46:58,163 --> 00:47:01,666
Come on, does it really require
two men to carry a light stand?

573
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:04,249
- Help them.
- I'll take care of it right away, Mr. Hitchcock.

574
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,099
All the difference when the money's
coming out of your own pocket, isn't it?

575
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,992
- We'll have a late lunch.
- Right.

576
00:47:09,016 --> 00:47:12,620
- I'll make the reservation for 1:30.
- Oh, Whit.

577
00:47:12,644 --> 00:47:15,036
What would I do without you?

578
00:47:15,402 --> 00:47:18,733
- Till then, bye-bye.
- Bye.

579
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:29,136
Whit, what did you forget now?

580
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:32,387
Whit?

581
00:47:36,826 --> 00:47:38,229
Whit?

582
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:02,510
- Mr. Hitchcock, sir, please...
- No, not now.

583
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:04,159
Every press outlet
is dying for photos.

584
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,761
If we could just get one photo,
please!

585
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:08,647
Get off my set! I'll have security...
Get off my set!

586
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,844
Just go! Get rid of this man.
He's a bloody pest.

587
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:12,800
Get him off the set now!

588
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,263
- Are you okay? You've gone very pale.
- I tell you get away.

589
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:17,914
Stop following me around
like a puppy dog and get me a drink.

590
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:21,098
- It's not even 3:00...
- Now give me the key to the cabinets.

591
00:48:24,823 --> 00:48:28,357
Hello, Hitch.
How's the picture?

592
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,165
I'm hearing interesting things.

593
00:48:30,189 --> 00:48:32,220
It's a miracle anyone can hear anything

594
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:35,340
above the noise coming from
Geoffrey Shurlock's office.

595
00:48:35,364 --> 00:48:38,569
You know, I shouldn't be in a position of
just hearing things, Hitch.

596
00:48:38,593 --> 00:48:41,814
- It's time you showed me some footage.
- Why?

597
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,114
To see if you're making a picture
Paramount can actually release.

598
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:50,117
As you well know,
my contract guarantees me final cut.

599
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,954
Your contract also says

600
00:48:51,977 --> 00:48:54,255
Paramount isn't required
to distribute any film

601
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:55,793
that could cause us embarrassment.

602
00:48:55,817 --> 00:48:59,796
Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis
films you're all so proud of.

603
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,661
I demand to see some footage.
Hitch!

604
00:49:02,684 --> 00:49:06,637
You show me some damn footage now!
Hitch!

605
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:28,230
You have no idea how wonderful it is
not to have to look after someone.

606
00:49:28,254 --> 00:49:31,436
I mean,
even if it's just for two hours.

607
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:35,088
So where are we going, Whit?
You haven't told me.

608
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:39,103
- I have a little surprise.
- Ooh!

609
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:54,435
- Where's your driver?
- I've been asking myself the same thing.

610
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,936
Well, I can give you a ride
if you'd like.

611
00:49:57,967 --> 00:50:01,055
Oh, my God.
What a tiny car.

612
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:03,511
What are these things?
I keep looking at them.

613
00:50:03,512 --> 00:50:06,439
- Candy corn. The girls love them.
- Candy corn?

614
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:09,016
I nicked them from Tony's dressing room.

615
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:12,709
Oh. Very nice.

616
00:50:12,732 --> 00:50:15,804
I thought you only ate those
Fauchon chocolates.

617
00:50:15,818 --> 00:50:19,094
Needs must when the devil drives,
my dear.

618
00:50:20,128 --> 00:50:26,038
- Oh, luckily I'm driving.
- Thank God for that.

619
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:28,897
He's always had obsessions
with his leading ladies.

620
00:50:28,898 --> 00:50:32,944
Just that this time it feels like
he's using them against me.

621
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:35,499
Well I suppose
he's like any great artist.

622
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,539
Impossible to live with,
but worth the effort.

623
00:50:38,562 --> 00:50:41,666
Did you know before we got together,
I was his boss?

624
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:45,229
He had to work his way up to assistant director
before he dared ask me out.

625
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:46,771
- Really? Huh!
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:50:52,002 --> 00:50:53,864
See that house over there?

627
00:50:55,116 --> 00:50:57,688
- Yes.
- What do you think of it?

628
00:50:57,711 --> 00:51:02,131
- Lovely, isn't it. What a great position.
- It's mine.

629
00:51:02,154 --> 00:51:04,315
I just talked to Elizabeth.
She didn't say anything about it.

630
00:51:04,338 --> 00:51:07,836
She doesn't know anything about it.
Nobody does.

631
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:09,514
Want to see it?

632
00:51:21,697 --> 00:51:24,535
- Thank you, my dear.
- Any time.

633
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,529
- Can I keep these?
- Absolutely.

634
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:28,601
- Would you like one?
- No thank you.

635
00:51:28,622 --> 00:51:30,102
- All right. Well, thank you.
- Hitch?

636
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:31,440
What?

637
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:36,627
What really did happen
with you and Vera?

638
00:51:37,776 --> 00:51:40,288
Oh. Vera.

639
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:45,805
She was going to play
the lead in Vertigo.

640
00:51:45,824 --> 00:51:50,212
Two weeks before filming
she told me was pregnant.

641
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,393
I was going to make her into a star.

642
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:58,539
But she chose
the life of a housewife instead.

643
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:05,549
Why do they do it, I wonder?

644
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:09,174
Why do they always betray me?

645
00:52:13,696 --> 00:52:17,212
Oh, very Bohemian.

646
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:20,291
I just leased it for the off season.

647
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:24,860
A place to get away from the wife,
and kids, and writing.

648
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:35,324
Whit, I hope you don't have the wrong idea.

649
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:42,125
If you were serious
about helping me adapt my book,

650
00:52:42,148 --> 00:52:45,082
I thought it might make the perfect...

651
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:48,709
hideaway.

652
00:53:01,996 --> 00:53:05,272
Relax! Naughty boys, calm down.

653
00:55:49,448 --> 00:55:52,195
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you

654
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:55,503
I read your treatment of that story.

655
00:55:56,761 --> 00:55:59,428
Taxi to... Where was it, dear?

656
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:03,052
- Dubrovnik.
- That's it. Dubrovnik.

657
00:56:06,457 --> 00:56:10,677
- Would you care to hear my opinion?
- Well, yes, naturally.

658
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:14,102
Right, then.

659
00:56:16,013 --> 00:56:19,578
Well, my dear, there's no
other way of saying it, is there?

660
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,953
It's a stillborn.

661
00:56:26,895 --> 00:56:28,703
How so?

662
00:56:28,726 --> 00:56:31,289
First of all,
the plot's a bit of a muddle, isn't it?

663
00:56:32,252 --> 00:56:34,214
Some of those jokes
are awfully like the ones

664
00:56:34,238 --> 00:56:36,646
we did so much better
hundreds of years ago

665
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:38,918
in The Lady Vanishes.

666
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:43,827
Also your villain is rather weak.
Well he's very weak, in fact.

667
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:46,785
But I think the big failure

668
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:52,443
is the relationship between
the heroine and the hero, you see.

669
00:56:55,352 --> 00:56:59,203
Probably if you weren't so smitten
with your friend Whitfield Cook,

670
00:56:59,226 --> 00:57:02,318
you'd be able to see that,
wouldn't you?

671
00:57:06,576 --> 00:57:07,668
But then I suppose

672
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:13,345
women never really care to face the truth
when their hearts are involved, do they?

673
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:19,229
How would you know what really goes on
between a man and a woman?

674
00:57:35,348 --> 00:57:38,177
My God, what a bloody mess.

675
00:58:29,779 --> 00:58:31,494
- No!
- Ah!

676
00:58:31,513 --> 00:58:33,796
More! More!

677
00:58:33,816 --> 00:58:35,960
- No! Oh!
- Use some guts!

678
00:58:35,977 --> 00:58:37,938
- Come on! No!
- Oh!

679
00:58:37,962 --> 00:58:41,043
- More anger!
- Oh! Oh!

680
00:58:41,066 --> 00:58:43,265
All right, cut!
Cut! Cut!

681
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:44,737
For God's sake!

682
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:47,460
Will someone get me
a proper stunt double?

683
00:58:47,473 --> 00:58:50,091
Now give me the knife!
Not yet!

684
00:58:52,327 --> 00:58:55,311
Ungovernable rage!

685
00:58:57,248 --> 00:59:00,388
Homicidal violence!

686
00:59:23,854 --> 00:59:26,804
Cut!
Cut and print!

687
00:59:30,649 --> 00:59:32,468
We've got it.

688
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:57,898
Oh, not now, Ed.

689
00:59:57,921 --> 01:00:00,997
It's really not the time.

690
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:11,491
You just can't keep this stuff
bottled up.

691
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:29,079
Oh, God! Hitch, Hitch, you all right?

692
01:00:29,808 --> 01:00:32,506
- Can you hear me?
- Alma...

693
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:39,593
What if Bridget and Constantine
get into the cab at the same time?

694
01:00:39,617 --> 01:00:42,658
Now what if they try and get in
at exactly the same time?

695
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:45,176
- Yes. What do you mean, "exactly"?
- Ie reach the door...

696
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,921
I mean they both reach for the cab door
at exactly the same time.

697
01:00:49,922 --> 01:00:51,587
- They quickly touch.
- Yes.

698
01:00:51,611 --> 01:00:55,075
We start on the hands,
we pan up to the eyes, and...

699
01:00:55,098 --> 01:00:57,897
Oh, that feels better already.

700
01:01:00,954 --> 01:01:03,373
- Are you going to get that?
- What?

701
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:31,639
Listen, I've told Peggy

702
01:01:31,663 --> 01:01:35,323
you have to get this sequence
shot today.

703
01:01:35,346 --> 01:01:36,579
What's the hold-up?

704
01:01:36,603 --> 01:01:38,728
We tried it ten different ways
and it looks terrible.

705
01:01:38,745 --> 01:01:45,483
No, it has to be a high angle.
You'll tip off the big surprise.

706
01:01:45,508 --> 01:01:47,347
Just get the process shot.

707
01:01:47,675 --> 01:01:51,096
How can he hold on to the camera frame
if he's waving his arms?

708
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:55,566
Why don't you just push all the gas
from the top of the stairs?

709
01:01:57,326 --> 01:01:58,864
No one's going to get hurt.

710
01:01:58,876 --> 01:02:00,686
What bloody idiots they are.

711
01:02:01,872 --> 01:02:03,791
- What are you doing?
- No more phone calls.

712
01:02:03,815 --> 01:02:06,269
- Oh, but...
- You're burning up.

713
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:09,019
Burning off our money,
that's what we're doing.

714
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:12,095
We're two days behind
and I'm stuck in this bloody bed.

715
01:02:12,118 --> 01:02:14,106
- Where do you think you're going?
- I've got to go to the set.

716
01:02:14,127 --> 01:02:19,071
- We can't lose another day.
- You stay in bed. I'll deal with it.

717
01:02:19,094 --> 01:02:23,067
I'd hate to take you away from
your writing partner.

718
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:26,847
You stay under the blankets, Alfred.

719
01:02:32,026 --> 01:02:33,263
- Mrs. Hitchcock.
- Good morning.

720
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:35,285
Where's Mr. Hitchcock?

721
01:02:40,727 --> 01:02:43,193
Don't stop work because of me.

722
01:02:43,216 --> 01:02:46,869
I'm only here as one of the two people
paying your salaries.

723
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:49,578
- What's the scene number?
- 173.

724
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:52,444
Storyboards?

725
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:59,097
All right. Put Martin in the chair.
Turn the camera around to face him.

726
01:02:59,098 --> 01:03:02,096
We'll shoot the fall against a rear screen.

727
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,134
And, Jack,
that lens should be a 35mm.

728
01:03:07,215 --> 01:03:10,066
Now, David,
you know how Paramount loves Jerry Lewis,

729
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,787
but this one is right up your alley,
and I would consider...

730
01:03:11,799 --> 01:03:13,607
Barney?

731
01:03:13,618 --> 01:03:15,297
Alma!

732
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,953
You know David Kirkpatrick.

733
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,156
- Hello.
- Hello.

734
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:20,510
He's working on Jerry Lewis
developing a new picture.

735
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:22,878
So he's free to help if you need.

736
01:03:24,158 --> 01:03:25,520
That won't be necessary.

737
01:03:25,543 --> 01:03:29,378
- But you're nearly three days behind.
- Yes. Well, we can manage.

738
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:32,715
Alma, we both know
what kind of film this is.

739
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:36,066
The smart thing to do would be
to help Hitch finish it.

740
01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:37,711
Thank you for your concern,
Barney.

741
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:41,383
But on a Hitchcock picture,
there is only one director.

742
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,870
No need to gawp.

743
01:04:00,676 --> 01:04:03,276
You forgot to look in the bathroom.

744
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:11,111
A man like you missing
a vital clue like that...

745
01:04:13,455 --> 01:04:15,315
What do you mean?

746
01:04:18,726 --> 01:04:21,674
My mother always said

747
01:04:22,642 --> 01:04:24,986
"If you want to do a job,

748
01:04:26,937 --> 01:04:28,896
do it right."

749
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,336
Check the floor.

750
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:49,543
Closer.

751
01:05:04,913 --> 01:05:08,264
You still think they're just
writing together?

752
01:05:11,628 --> 01:05:14,257
What are you gonna do about it?

753
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:32,402
Oh, Mrs. Hitchcock.

754
01:05:33,441 --> 01:05:37,051
I know Hitch isn't feeling very well,
so I got him a little something.

755
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,918
Oh, how kind. Thank you very much.

756
01:05:40,699 --> 01:05:42,732
Candy corn.

757
01:05:42,756 --> 01:05:45,644
Well, he's always been
very considerate of me.

758
01:05:45,668 --> 01:05:48,024
I haven't always had that
from my directors.

759
01:05:50,114 --> 01:05:53,310
Janet, I'd just like to say that

760
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,920
you've been very professional.

761
01:05:58,179 --> 01:06:00,520
It hasn't gone unappreciated.

762
01:06:01,766 --> 01:06:03,359
Thank you.

763
01:06:03,382 --> 01:06:05,662
- Lovely seeing you.
- You, too.

764
01:06:25,753 --> 01:06:27,867
May I turn it down?

765
01:06:35,931 --> 01:06:39,691
Well you'll be pleased to know
that order has been restored.

766
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:43,622
And a "thank you" would be nice.

767
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:47,170
We're still two days behind
and $60,000 over budget.

768
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:50,442
Yes, well I'll cancel the wrap party.
That'll save us $2000 right there.

769
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:54,626
And you won't be tempted
by any champagne and cake.

770
01:06:54,627 --> 01:06:57,730
Beware,
all men are potential murderers.

771
01:06:59,622 --> 01:07:01,786
And for good reason.

772
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,610
All right, what's this all about?

773
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,902
Spending a lot of time at the beach?

774
01:07:23,555 --> 01:07:27,701
Yes. Yes, it's where Whit and I are writing.
He's rented a place.

775
01:07:27,702 --> 01:07:31,235
Hardly the ideal situation
to avoid distractions.

776
01:07:31,236 --> 01:07:34,388
Actually, it's very conducive to
creative collaboration.

777
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,890
I've already told you
that treatment is a waste of time.

778
01:07:36,913 --> 01:07:39,795
Well, didn't they say
the same thing about Psycho?

779
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,205
Are you and Whit having an affair?

780
01:07:55,198 --> 01:07:57,347
Oh, don't be absurd.

781
01:07:57,371 --> 01:08:01,609
He's working on something new.
He just needs a little help, that's all.

782
01:08:01,632 --> 01:08:04,455
Oh, what a coincidence.
I'm working on something new

783
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,041
and I could use a little help, too!

784
01:08:06,064 --> 01:08:07,411
Well, what do you think
I've been doing?

785
01:08:07,422 --> 01:08:09,465
Why are you spending all the hours
of day and night with that

786
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:12,125
talentless mummy's boy?

787
01:08:13,118 --> 01:08:14,585
Because it's fun!

788
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:17,658
I am under extraordinary pressures
on this picture,

789
01:08:17,682 --> 01:08:21,640
and the least you could do
is give me your full support.

790
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:24,857
Full support?

791
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:27,286
We've mortgaged our house.

792
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,333
Might I remind you

793
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:33,062
I have weighed in
on every aspect of this film so far,

794
01:08:33,086 --> 01:08:36,835
as I have done on every film
you've made in the last three decades.

795
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:40,595
First time you show the film,
it will be my notes that you want.

796
01:08:40,618 --> 01:08:42,837
I celebrate with you
when the reviews are good.

797
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,468
I cry for you when they are bad.

798
01:08:44,491 --> 01:08:48,002
I host your parties and
I put up with those fantasy romances

799
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:50,346
with your leading ladies.

800
01:08:50,347 --> 01:08:52,623
And when you're out
promoting this film around the world,

801
01:08:52,624 --> 01:08:55,031
I will be there beside you,
or rather, slightly behind you,

802
01:08:55,054 --> 01:08:59,396
smiling endlessly for the press
even though I'm ready to drop,

803
01:08:59,419 --> 01:09:03,095
and being gracious to people who
look through me as if I were invisible

804
01:09:03,096 --> 01:09:05,399
or elbow me aside because all they can see

805
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,326
is the great and glorious genius Alfred Hitchcock!

806
01:09:09,348 --> 01:09:13,366
And now, for the first time in years,

807
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:17,517
I dare to work on something that isn't
an Alfred Hitchcock production

808
01:09:17,518 --> 01:09:20,835
and I'm met with
accusation and criticisms?

809
01:09:22,379 --> 01:09:26,429
The work I am doing with Whit
gives me pleasure and purpose,

810
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:30,000
and it takes absolutely
nothing away from you.

811
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:35,664
Consider this a reminder:
I am your wife, Alma Reville.

812
01:09:35,687 --> 01:09:38,550
Not one of those contract blondes
you badger

813
01:09:38,573 --> 01:09:41,732
and torment with your
oh-so-specific directions.

814
01:10:15,998 --> 01:10:17,681
Well...

815
01:10:17,694 --> 01:10:19,812
I guess this is goodbye.

816
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:25,632
Why didn't you stay with me?

817
01:10:27,308 --> 01:10:31,617
I would have made you
as big a star as Grace Kelly.

818
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:38,999
Well, unlike Grace Kelly,
I can pick my own dry cleaning.

819
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:42,286
I've got a family, Hitch. A home.

820
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:49,187
That blonde woman of mystery
you're always after?

821
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,159
She's a fantasy.

822
01:10:51,183 --> 01:10:52,852
She doesn't exist.

823
01:10:54,523 --> 01:10:57,871
There was a time when
I thought I understood you.

824
01:10:59,404 --> 01:11:01,687
Understood women.

825
01:11:53,172 --> 01:11:56,318
Alma, I thought you were coming
later this afternoon.

826
01:11:56,342 --> 01:11:58,091
I thought you rented this place
so we could write.

827
01:11:58,115 --> 01:11:59,841
I did.

828
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:05,542
- You're not going to say anything, are you?
- Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.

829
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:08,094
I mean to Hitch.

830
01:12:09,415 --> 01:12:14,699
Alma, we can't all be geniuses.

831
01:12:14,723 --> 01:12:16,801
You're incredibly talented.

832
01:12:16,824 --> 01:12:19,917
But, after all, we want him
to read the script with an open mind.

833
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,197
Don't we?

834
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,766
I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.

835
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:32,307
Sheriff, please, I'm worried.

836
01:12:32,331 --> 01:12:35,419
Arbogast said he'd call
as soon as he spoke with Mrs. Bates.

837
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:37,485
That was yesterday evening.

838
01:12:37,509 --> 01:12:41,546
- Norman isn't married.
- He said it was his mother.

839
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:45,366
Your detective saw Norman's mother
up at the motel?

840
01:12:45,389 --> 01:12:47,139
In the upstairs window.

841
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,582
He rang me right after
she called out to him.

842
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:53,740
Missy, I think your detective
must be a few cups in.

843
01:12:53,764 --> 01:13:00,024
Mrs. Bates died of strychnine poisoning
more than ten years ago.

844
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:03,488
- Are you sure?
- That body was...

845
01:13:09,984 --> 01:13:13,307
This is my favorite place.

846
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:18,987
I just shut the door
and make the world go away.

847
01:13:19,844 --> 01:13:23,419
Don't you ever get lonely out here?

848
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,989
I can always talk to my mother.

849
01:13:39,769 --> 01:13:42,528
That's strange.

850
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:45,823
Jesus Christ.
I think we found his hiding place.

851
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:54,747
That's my mother's room.

852
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,565
That's my mother's room.

853
01:14:04,365 --> 01:14:06,719
You can't go in there!

854
01:14:06,737 --> 01:14:08,778
Don't go in my mother's room!

855
01:14:22,854 --> 01:14:25,203
Hitch?

856
01:14:25,226 --> 01:14:27,152
Hitch?

857
01:14:28,244 --> 01:14:30,645
So what's the verdict?

858
01:14:30,669 --> 01:14:34,755
Let's just say it was a four-letter review
and it wasn't "good."

859
01:14:37,212 --> 01:14:38,550
Screw him.

860
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:42,082
It's too late for Paramount to back out,
no matter what Balaban says.

861
01:14:44,191 --> 01:14:49,009
The other route is to re-cut it
as a two-parter for the TV series.

862
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:51,299
Because of the budget
and the Hitchcock name,

863
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:53,401
we stand a good chance
of breaking even.

864
01:14:55,667 --> 01:15:00,324
Look, I made Jimmy Stewart
a millionaire on Winchester 73,

865
01:15:00,347 --> 01:15:01,744
and that was a dog.

866
01:15:01,768 --> 01:15:04,676
At least I could sit through
your picture.

867
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:10,982
More importantly,
what does Alma think?

868
01:15:35,383 --> 01:15:37,250
I was afraid you'd try to
blame yourself.

869
01:15:37,274 --> 01:15:38,577
I'm not talking of blame.

870
01:15:38,589 --> 01:15:41,031
Leigh, how can you make plans
if you're still not sure?

871
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,751
Whit must've enjoyed writing for Colbert.

872
01:16:10,393 --> 01:16:12,960
How was the beach?

873
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:17,004
Cold and miserable.

874
01:16:18,609 --> 01:16:22,281
Just like Barney Balaban's face.

875
01:16:26,592 --> 01:16:28,848
Poor old Whit.

876
01:16:30,469 --> 01:16:34,336
He isn't worth a damn
when he's not working with you.

877
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,487
Neither am I.

878
01:16:47,724 --> 01:16:51,994
I couldn't pull off the picture this time.

879
01:16:52,018 --> 01:16:55,570
It just sits there,

880
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:58,192
refusing to come to life.

881
01:17:02,323 --> 01:17:05,717
I guess there's no other way of saying it,
is there?

882
01:17:08,011 --> 01:17:10,344
It's stillborn.

883
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,028
I let you down, my love.

884
01:17:24,124 --> 01:17:26,923
You deserve better.

885
01:17:34,271 --> 01:17:36,473
Better go feed Geoffrey and Stanley.

886
01:17:38,131 --> 01:17:40,400
Come on, boys.

887
01:18:59,695 --> 01:19:02,705
I don't think I can stand us
both being maudlin.

888
01:19:03,798 --> 01:19:09,192
That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation
I've been helping Whit finish is done.

889
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,957
You know there's only
one solution to all this.

890
01:19:14,981 --> 01:19:17,458
That we get back to work together.

891
01:19:18,472 --> 01:19:21,537
The fact is I rather like
living in this house.

892
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,430
So I suggest, for everyone's sake,
we start whipping Psycho into shape.

893
01:19:28,356 --> 01:19:30,706
You may not be the easiest man
to live with,

894
01:19:30,717 --> 01:19:33,908
but you know how to cut a picture
better than anyone else.

895
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:40,852
Except for you.

896
01:19:43,244 --> 01:19:46,015
The second take.
The light is much better on the hands.

897
01:19:50,089 --> 01:19:53,182
Only cut back to Janet
once the car's already moving.

898
01:19:53,194 --> 01:19:54,967
Cut it tighter.

899
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:01,365
Ooh, you imp,
you got nudity in there!

900
01:20:01,388 --> 01:20:06,457
Her breasts were rather large.
It was a challenge not to show them.

901
01:20:06,481 --> 01:20:08,221
You'll have to cut
those six or seven frames

902
01:20:08,232 --> 01:20:10,474
where she blinks after
she's supposed to be dead.

903
01:20:10,492 --> 01:20:13,863
Alma, we've viewed the film
a thousand times.

904
01:20:13,874 --> 01:20:15,671
She does not blink.

905
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:21,888
- How's it going in there?
- Swimmingly.

906
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:24,145
Everyone's saying it's like a dog with fleas.

907
01:20:25,177 --> 01:20:27,220
No, absolutely not!

908
01:20:27,231 --> 01:20:30,449
I do not want music
over the show murder scene.

909
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,820
But what Alma and I talked about
is really going to play.

910
01:20:32,838 --> 01:20:36,324
Bernie, this is not Vertigo.
It's not a romantic movie.

911
01:20:36,339 --> 01:20:38,121
The images must work on their own.

912
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,481
Yes, but you can't scare people
just by going, "Boo!"

913
01:20:40,492 --> 01:20:42,500
All right, you do it then.
You know best.

914
01:20:42,524 --> 01:20:44,212
- They have to anticipate it.
- You always know best, just do it!

915
01:20:44,235 --> 01:20:45,752
Take a step back.

916
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:04,037
- What do you think?
- I think I'll never have a shower again.

917
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:09,571
- Hitch?
- It's getting there.

918
01:21:13,496 --> 01:21:16,953
I distinctly saw both
the stabbing and the nudity.

919
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:21,658
What you think you're seeing is purely
informed by the power of suggestion.

920
01:21:21,673 --> 01:21:24,785
I assure you once you view the final version

921
01:21:24,808 --> 01:21:27,110
with Mr. Herrmann's lovely,
lyrical score...

922
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:31,512
A lyrical score is not going to
change my opinion.

923
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:35,621
We're denying your seal.

924
01:21:36,526 --> 01:21:39,903
Geoffrey, would you mind if we had a word
in private, please?

925
01:21:46,411 --> 01:21:48,257
Thank you.

926
01:21:54,455 --> 01:21:56,508
Now look here.

927
01:21:56,531 --> 01:21:59,666
I have a modest proposal to make.

928
01:21:59,678 --> 01:22:03,013
If you're willing to leave
the shower sequence as it is,

929
01:22:03,036 --> 01:22:08,415
I will re-shoot the opening love scene
to your exact specifications.

930
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:13,718
In fact, I would welcome your
personal supervision on the set.

931
01:22:17,445 --> 01:22:19,558
To my specifications?

932
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:22,376
But of course, my dear fellow.

933
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,277
If only audiences
could fully comprehend

934
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:28,729
how tirelessly you work
to help us entertain them

935
01:22:28,753 --> 01:22:32,882
while protecting them
from filth and indecency.

936
01:22:39,646 --> 01:22:42,131
He's been harassing you
since you announced this project,

937
01:22:42,154 --> 01:22:44,550
you invite him to the set,
and he doesn't even show up?

938
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:46,228
What did you tell him?

939
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:49,119
That I respected him deeply.

940
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:58,181
Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap.
Thank you all very much.

941
01:23:01,655 --> 01:23:05,107
- I thought we were re-shooting the scene.
- The charade is over.

942
01:23:05,131 --> 01:23:06,907
Thank you.

943
01:23:12,926 --> 01:23:16,578
See, I wasn't that much of a monster
to work with, was I?

944
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:18,280
Not at all.

945
01:23:18,304 --> 01:23:21,257
I hope I was sufficiently loyal
to the cause.

946
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:24,183
Worthy of a Purple Heart,
my dear.

947
01:23:46,485 --> 01:23:48,058
I hope you don't mind,

948
01:23:48,082 --> 01:23:51,423
I told Mrs. Bates
she could use your dressing room.

949
01:23:58,394 --> 01:24:01,850
No, that's splendid. Splendid.

950
01:24:02,739 --> 01:24:05,627
Yes, thank you.

951
01:24:06,509 --> 01:24:08,223
Thank you.

952
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:10,897
We have the seal
from the Shurlock Office.

953
01:24:10,922 --> 01:24:13,987
So now,
we lead the lambs to the slaughter.

954
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:17,267
Paramount confirmed they're only
opening the movie in two theaters,

955
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:19,450
as we suspected.
And no premiere.

956
01:24:20,725 --> 01:24:23,695
We don't get word of mouth,
we're dead.

957
01:24:25,287 --> 01:24:28,422
Then we'd better get started.
Peggy, take a memo.

958
01:24:28,445 --> 01:24:32,540
We're going to write a manual
on how to sell Psycho.

959
01:24:34,883 --> 01:24:37,796
"My first instruction to Theater Owners:

960
01:24:37,819 --> 01:24:43,272
Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce
our unique admission policies."

961
01:24:43,296 --> 01:24:47,929
- There may be riots here tonight.
- "Because is Psycho is so terrifying and unique,

962
01:24:47,952 --> 01:24:52,664
"the guards can help you deal
with customers who run amok.

963
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,588
"Post our special lobby clocks

964
01:24:54,612 --> 01:24:58,980
"to remind audiences
of the starting times for Psycho.

965
01:24:59,003 --> 01:25:03,850
The manager of this fine motion picture
theater has been advised

966
01:25:03,874 --> 01:25:08,955
not to allow anyone to enter the theater
once Psycho begins.

967
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:13,608
Now, should you be so foolish as to
attempt to slip in by a side entrance,

968
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:16,434
a fire escape or through a skylight,

969
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:19,922
you will be ejected by brute force.

970
01:25:19,945 --> 01:25:22,383
More playful, darling.

971
01:25:22,406 --> 01:25:28,336
"To further emphasize the sheer,
unrelenting shock and suspense of Psycho,

972
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:31,457
"right after the closing title "The End,"

973
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:39,794
"we strongly recommend that you close your
house curtains over the screen for a full 30 seconds.

974
01:25:40,908 --> 01:25:44,102
"By doing so, the horror of Psycho

975
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:50,102
"will be indelibly etched
in the mind and heart of your audience.

976
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:54,924
Sincerely and emphatically,
Alfred Hitchcock."

977
01:25:54,948 --> 01:25:57,247
Well at least there are some people here,
Hitch.

978
01:26:05,616 --> 01:26:07,536
We've roped off some seats for you.

979
01:26:08,812 --> 01:26:10,754
- You go on ahead.
- Are you sure?

980
01:26:10,773 --> 01:26:13,473
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.
I'm just going to check the print. You go on.

981
01:26:13,497 --> 01:26:15,904
All right, darling.
We'll save you a seat, all right?

982
01:26:17,336 --> 01:26:19,345
This way, Mr. Hitchcock.

983
01:28:19,781 --> 01:28:21,584
Just got off the phone with Balaban.

984
01:28:21,607 --> 01:28:25,181
He said congratulations.
A well-deserved triumph, as we always knew.

985
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,534
As we always knew, ha!

986
01:28:27,557 --> 01:28:31,791
- Does this mean I can take the weekend off now?
- Yes, dear. Thank you so much.

987
01:28:31,815 --> 01:28:34,105
- Where's Alma?
- Go. Go on.

988
01:28:45,566 --> 01:28:47,923
Alma, come here.

989
01:28:54,957 --> 01:28:58,581
You know, darling,
this could be the biggest success of your career.

990
01:29:00,061 --> 01:29:02,597
Our career.

991
01:29:04,143 --> 01:29:11,761
Alma, I will never be able to find
a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you.

992
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:20,858
I've waited thirty years
to hear you say that.

993
01:29:20,882 --> 01:29:27,142
And that, my dear,
is why they call me the Master of Suspense.

994
01:29:49,516 --> 01:29:52,028
And so, gentle viewers,

995
01:29:52,052 --> 01:29:55,828
Psycho turned out to be
one of my greatest achievements,

996
01:29:55,851 --> 01:30:01,099
and Alma and I got to keep the house
and the swimming pool.

997
01:30:01,122 --> 01:30:04,445
But you know what they say in Hollywood:

998
01:30:04,469 --> 01:30:08,011
You're only as good as your last picture.

999
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:12,573
So if you'll excuse me,
I had better toddle away

1000
01:30:12,597 --> 01:30:17,373
to begin the exhaustive search
for my next project.

1001
01:30:17,397 --> 01:30:24,913
Unfortunately, I find myself
once again quite bereft of any inspiration.

1002
01:30:24,937 --> 01:30:30,778
However, I do hope
something comes along soon.

1003
01:30:35,548 --> 01:30:37,984
Good evening.
