00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,359
<i>In Saint Tropez...</i>

2
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,236
<i>the moon wakes up with you.</i>

3
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,287
<i>She twists</i>

4
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,285
<i>counting the stars in the sky.</i>

5
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,748
<i>But there's a prettier star that's
not in the sky, but with me,</i>

6
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,132
<i>in Saint Tropez.</i>

7
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,467
<i>But there's a prettier star
that's not in the sky, but with me,</i>

8
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,971
<i>in Saint Tropez.</i>

9
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,099
<i>Twist, twist, everybody.</i>

10
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:01,144
<i>Twist, twist, it's going mad.</i>

11
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,805
<i>She dreams and wants to live</i>

12
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,860
<i>a long unforgettable night
in Saint Tropez.</i>

13
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,857
<i>People wonder why</i>

14
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,941
<i>you dance to the twist</i>

15
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,660
<i>wearing a lamé dress.</i>

16
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,584
<i>You wanna look ever prettier,
but fashion stays the same</i>

17
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,829
<i>if you dance to the twist.</i>

18
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,168
<i>You wanna look ever prettier,
but fashion stays the same</i>

19
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,211
<i>if you dance to the twist.</i>

20
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,897
<i>Twist, twist, everybody.</i>

21
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,775
<i>Twist, twist, it's going mad.</i>

22
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,653
<i>She dreams and wants to live</i>

23
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,574
<i>a long unforgettable night
in Saint Tropez.</i>

24
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,658
<i>People wonder why</i>

25
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,504
<i>you dance to the twist</i>

26
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,536
<i>wearing a lamé dress.</i>

27
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,507
<i>You wanna look ever prettier,
but fashion stays the same</i>

28
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,756
<i>if you dance to the twist.</i>

29
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,225
Now don't forget you'll get
your teeth cleaned next Tuesday at 3.

30
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,937
Oh, yeah!

31
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,737
Do you have a cold?

32
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,988
Joe! Do you have a cold?

33
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,867
No, I'm alright.

34
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,996
Eddie, did we pick the
Chinese dressing gown?

35
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,541
It's in the silver trunk.

36
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:48,299
<i>Every holy day in church,</i>

37
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,224
No, thanks.

38
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,102
Have you gone taller again?

39
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,311
Growing a little every day.

40
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:07,858
<i>when I offered my prayers to God,</i>

41
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:14,204
<i>a handsome and gallant young man</i>

42
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:20,922
<i>would keep offering himself to my gaze.</i>

43
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,090
- I had a strange dream last night.
- What?

44
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,684
It's...

45
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,305
- ...it's boring.
- Tell me.

46
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,351
No, no, you're busy packing.
I'll tell you later.

47
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,192
You always tell me your dreams.

48
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,105
When people tell me their dreams
I find it very uninteresting.

49
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,938
I'll tell you later. We'll have lots
of time on the boat, OK?

50
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,197
Remember we have two hours
to get ready.

51
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,294
Will you tell me on the boat?

52
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,586
Mom, you never take me with you.

53
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:09,088
<i>Our lips remained sealed,</i>

54
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,801
It's not true, you know that.

55
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:15,055
I took you to Washington,
took you to Seattle...

56
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,142
Yes, but I wanna go to Europe,
I wanna go to Italy with you.

57
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,433
You can't.

58
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,185
Why not? I can do all
the things dad does.

59
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:27,318
I can make your reservations for you,
I can negotiate your contract for you...

60
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,529
Come on, that's what your dad does.

61
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,859
Yes, but I can do it better.

62
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,408
What about your school?

63
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,445
Let me come.

64
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,000
- No.
- Yes.

65
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,918
Alright, alright.

66
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,640
Are you drinking?

67
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,350
Yes, I am.

68
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:03,845
You know what I saw on cable last night?
I saw a Chinese TV show.

69
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,230
This old China man comes out.

70
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:19,372
And underneath him are subtitles.
In Chinese.

71
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,339
What's my tennis racket doing out here?

72
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,304
I was trying to hit the ball
into the river.

73
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,592
- The river?
- Yeah.

74
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,972
- Wanna see me hit the city?
- I bet you a buck you can't do it.

75
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,730
Dad, why don't you stay here with me?
You and I can have so much fun together.

76
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,105
And mom doesn't need you. She can get
somebody else to do all her junk for her.

77
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:53,283
Come on, you and me can go to the ball
park. We can have so much fun.

78
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,200
It's a fine idea, Joe,
we must do it.

79
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,574
- You mean it?
- Absolutely.

80
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,665
Joe, take this down for me
and put it in the blue suitcase.

81
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,296
I get it.

82
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:46,334
Jesus Christ! He leaves his gum
all over the place.

83
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,916
Are you talking to me?

84
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,839
No, I'm just talking to myself.

85
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,844
- I'm gonna take the car down to the garage.
- OK.

86
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,343
I'll be back in a few moments.

87
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,602
Douglas!

88
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,073
No!

89
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,525
Please, stop crying.

90
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,694
Would you please stop crying?

91
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,886
I can't stand these people.

92
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,730
Were those ducks or geese?

93
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:59,357
I can't spend another night
in the house, Joe. I can't.

94
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,324
I'm gonna leave on the
first available flight.

95
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,778
What about me?

96
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:09,156
You come with me, darling.
We spend the night in the plane,

97
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,618
we eat, we sleep, we'll...

98
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,081
- Don't make decisions for me.
- We wake up, we'll be in Italy.

99
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,712
- Italy?
- I'll go to rehearsal, I'll sing...

100
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:22,884
Darling, you can put your things
in the black trunk,

101
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,134
the dark trunk... You can put your music
in with my music, your records...

102
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,854
- I've got school.
- ...you can put your clothes...

103
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,519
...and bring your... Well,
there are schools in Italy.

104
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,268
Joe, you can go to school in Italy...

105
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,110
Yeah, but I got a big game coming up.
It's important to me. They need me.

106
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,520
A game?

107
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,989
You're making it
so difficult for me, Joe.

108
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:51,276
Please, please, darling, please.

109
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,344
- Let's get out of here.
- Could you take us home, please?

110
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,593
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,792
Assholes, get out of the way!

112
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,882
I knew it, I knew it!
I knew he'd fall.

113
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,271
Hey, give me a puff now!

114
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,611
Where are you from?

115
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,774
The Yankees lost 14 to...

116
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,702
Hey, give me the joint,
it's my turn!

117
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,239
Thanks.

118
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,497
Will you please stop the car?

119
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,577
Driver, would you please stop the car?

120
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,718
I think you're being real shitty.

121
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,182
What a dumb ass rat bastard!

122
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,595
Here, you guys take it.
I don't want it.

123
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,977
Arianna, where are you going?

124
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,776
Julian, what are you doing?

125
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,751
- Bye, Julian.
- Good luck, bye.

126
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,751
- I'm coming with you.
- Where?

127
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,883
- With you.
- I got some things to do.

128
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,669
Well, if you want, I'll go away.

129
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,337
I got nothing against you,
I mean, I don't even know you.

130
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,842
My name is Arianna.
I'm Italian.

131
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,432
My name is Joe.
I'm American.

132
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,219
Actually I've got a girlfriend,
in New York.

133
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,677
That's nice.

134
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,653
Lot of fantastic palm trees.
Kinda reminds you of LA, doesn't it?

135
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,729
- Never been there.
- Neither have I.

136
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,647
What's she like?

137
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,609
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.

138
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,954
She's a pain in the neck.

139
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,741
Actually, she's not really
my girlfriend.

140
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,083
Then, why were you
telling me about her?

141
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,250
I don't know.

142
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,381
Two.

143
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,418
Go away!

144
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,057
Why do we have to lock ourselves up
in a movie theater?

145
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,182
I have to take a wicked piss.

146
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,521
How do you feel?

147
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,692
I've never felt so wonderful
in my whole life.

148
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,520
Me too.

149
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,359
That's the kind of answer
a man likes to hear.

150
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,114
My father talks like that.

151
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,738
My father's dead.

152
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,172
You wanna go sit down?

153
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,552
- Wait.
- What's the matter?

154
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,835
I can't.

155
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,892
<i>Hey. Get out the fire hose!</i>

156
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,808
<i>Would you mind playing this?</i>

157
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,477
When did she learn Italian?

158
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,995
- I have to tell you something.
- I already know.

159
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,328
No, you don't.
You don't know anything.

160
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,381
it's your first time.

161
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:58,472
Everything seems so perfect now.
Right where it belongs.

162
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,933
I wish you could be a part of me.
You'd understand.

163
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,932
I want to understand.
I wanna be inside you.

164
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,889
- How?
- Help me get my jeans off.

165
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,526
<i>- Plain Cokes or did you spike 'em?
- No, just plain. Would you like one?</i>

166
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,149
<i>No, thanks.</i>

167
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,406
Christ! You don't have to pull
them all the way off.

168
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,825
Now yours.

169
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,829
<i>There isn't any other song.</i>

170
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,246
You look better
than Marilyn Monroe.

171
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,814
- And now?
- Now we kiss.

172
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,159
Now be inside me.

173
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,953
Here?

174
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,913
Do you know how?
I've never done it.

175
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,956
You're excused, I'm a virgin too.

176
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,600
<i>Why should the Falls drag me down
here at 5 o'clock in the morning?</i>

177
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,360
<i>To show me how big they are
and how small I am?</i>

178
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,942
<i>To remind me they can get along
without any help?</i>

179
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,824
I must go.
I must go.

180
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,328
Look, I took your jeans

181
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,547
Why haven't you had it taken out?

182
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,007
I was born with it,
I wanna die with it.

183
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,935
Julian, will you walk me home?

184
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:44,085
<i>Then there came a thrill of joy...</i>

185
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,720
<i>...to my heart,</i>

186
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,509
<i>to my heart.</i>

187
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,885
<i>A thrill of joy such</i>

188
00:23:52,932 --> 00:24:02,442
<i>as only the angels feel!</i>

189
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:06,605
<i>Earth seemed a heaven</i>

190
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,276
<i>to my heart,</i>

191
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:20,700
<i>to my enraptured eyes.</i>

192
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,800
Did you remember to turn off
the lights before we left?

193
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,682
Fucking assholes!

194
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:45,349
<i>Yes, earth seemed a heaven.</i>

195
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:36,157
<i>Oh, Leonora, you are awake.</i>

196
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,325
<i>I know it by the flickering
of your lamp...</i>

197
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:45,547
<i>...as it shines down
from your balcony.</i>

198
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:55,045
<i>Ah, love's fire burns...</i>

199
00:25:55,096 --> 00:26:01,976
<i>...in every fiber.</i>

200
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,400
<i>I must see you,</i>

201
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,070
<i>you must hear me.</i>

202
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,067
<i>I come to you.</i>

203
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,189
<i>To us,</i>

204
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:14,618
<i>this is our loveliest moment!</i>

205
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,709
<i>Troubadour!</i>

206
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,786
<i>I tremble with rage!</i>

207
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:34,467
<i>Alone upon this earth.</i>

208
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:41,345
<i>Unlucky in war.</i>

209
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,935
<i>Nothing but a heart</i>

210
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:48,266
<i>is the hope of the Troubadour.</i>

211
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:53,202
<i>Nothing but a heart,</i>

212
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:58,237
<i>a heart for the Troubadour.</i>

213
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,872
<i>Oh, listen!</i>

214
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,749
<i>I tremble!</i>

215
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:16,140
<i>But if he possesses that heart...</i>

216
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:22,925
<i>beautiful in its pure faith...</i>

217
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,347
<i>I despair.</i>

218
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,151
The jealousy.

219
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:29,817
<i>- The jealousy.
- Then he is greater than any king,</i>

220
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:34,737
<i>Then he is greater...</i>

221
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:44,044
<i>...greater than any king.</i>

222
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,167
<i>I am not mistaken. She is coming.</i>

223
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,760
<i>- My soul!
- What shall I do?</i>

224
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,417
<i>You are late tonight.</i>

225
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:58,756
<i>The beating of my heart marked
the passing moments.</i>

226
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:04,475
<i>Then at last gracious love</i>

227
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,648
<i>brings you to my arms.</i>

228
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,809
Faithless.

229
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,645
<i>Faithless!</i>

230
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,315
<i>That voice!</i>

231
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:21,831
<i>Ah, in the darkness
I have made a terrible blunder!</i>

232
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,409
<i>I thought it was you
I spoke to, not him.</i>

233
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,130
<i>You, whom alone my soul
entreats and desires.</i>

234
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:35,508
<i>I love you, I swear it,
with a great and everlasting love!</i>

235
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,628
<i>- You dare?
- I can desire no more!</i>

236
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,699
<i>Your blood, o wretch,
is scarcely enough to quench it!</i>

237
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,079
<i>You dared to tell him,
"I love you!".</i>

238
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,793
<i>and he shall live no more.</i>

239
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:14,590
<i>He shall live no more,
he shall live no more.</i>

240
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:22,217
<i>Your blood, o wretch,
is scarcely enough to quench it!</i>

241
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:28,849
<i>You dared to tell him,
"I love you!". You said, "I love you!".</i>

242
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:33,024
<i>You said, "I love you!".
You said, "I love you!".</i>

243
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:37,485
<i>He shall live no more.</i>

244
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,946
<i>You said, "I love you!".</i>

245
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:46,123
<i>- He shall live no more.
- You said, "I love you!".</i>

246
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:56,160
<i>Your blood is scarcely enough
to quench it!</i>

247
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,176
Bravo, bravo!

248
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:19,742
Come on, out everybody.
Let her rest.

249
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,857
Out everybody, I said!

250
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:25,324
Give her time to change.
Come on, out.

251
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:34,827
Caterina! Your voice is beautiful.
You've never sung so well.

252
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,549
I know. I held that D flat
for nine measures.

253
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,171
I don't understand your B flat.

254
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,505
- D!
- D, B.

255
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,260
The only thing I know.

256
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,769
Since Douglas died
you are singing much better.

257
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,595
No smoking.

258
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,481
It's not just my voice.
I'm stronger, Marina.

259
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,857
Shall I remove your wig?

260
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,245
I feel so old.

261
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:22,876
Don't be silly. You are stunning.
Everyone adores you.

262
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,053
I've always been a big hit with fags.

263
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,053
Iole, you're hurting me.

264
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,184
I was great tonight.

265
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:37,605
It's all Joe's fault...

266
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,937
If he'd stopped growing,
I wouldn't be so old.

267
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,033
Right. What about tomorrow?

268
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,911
- What's tomorrow?
- Joe's birthday.

269
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,036
No! Shit!

270
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,536
How could I forget?

271
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:58,168
Oh, Marina, I'm terrible,
I don't remember anything.

272
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,298
- How could you?
- I hate birthdays.

273
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:07,129
You know, I was nervous tonight.
I was scared.

274
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,598
It's the first time I've sung
here in years

275
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,058
and I knew that that audience.
They were...

276
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,599
They were out to get me.
They were watching

277
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,732
every single thing I did.

278
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,821
You were truly great.
Extraordinary.

279
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,162
Truly fantastic.
Unforgettable.

280
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:37,409
No, no, no kisses, Fiorella.
They're dangerous for her voice, honey.

281
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:01,268
I want a lot of people
at Joe's birthday.

282
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,694
I want him to feel important.

283
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,402
I want him to feel loved.

284
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,658
I only want a few people at my party.

285
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,581
- Joe, you scared the hell out of me.
- Where have you been, Joe?

286
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,541
You promised me that you'd be here.
I needed you.

287
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,582
I don't even know how I got
through the performance without you.

288
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,252
I heard a 10 minute applause.

289
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:30,884
Actually, it was a standing ovation.

290
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:33,678
Joe...

291
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,808
You are naughty.

292
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,062
Mom, lay off, you are getting
lipstick all over me.

293
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,483
I only wanna have a few friends
at my party,

294
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,784
you know, like Bobby, Arianna...

295
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:52,068
Yes, I understand, dear,
just people who really love you.

296
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,164
People who really love me
don't forget my birthday.

297
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,087
How long have you been here?

298
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,586
I'll get it.

299
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,848
- Hello.
- Hello.

300
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:21,265
- Edward!
- Marina.

301
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,193
Where is Caterina?

302
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:25,855
Edward!

303
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,744
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- OK.

304
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,414
- It's hot here, isn't it?
- I think you need a drink.

305
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,711
- Hot, mm?
- So take your coat off.

306
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,301
How was I, Edward?

307
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,766
The plane was 2 fucking hours late.

308
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,227
I'm terribly sorry, Caterina,

309
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,805
but I missed the performance.

310
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,573
Edward, another drink?

311
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,493
She's so beautiful!
She's so beautiful!

312
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,871
- Did you take the D flat tonight?
- You blew it, Edward.

313
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:24,405
Caterina, you know I adore you.

314
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,843
People who adore me don't miss
my opening nights.

315
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,054
Right, Joe?

316
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,308
Girls, girls!
Come up here.

317
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,677
Come, we're having a party.
It's beautiful.

318
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,814
It's a birthday for my son!

319
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,647
Oh, Joe!

320
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:53,355
The most beautiful girls in the street.
They were there like angels.

321
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,532
What a coincidence.

322
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:58,619
They'll come up, they'll sing for you.
They're so beautiful!

323
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,157
Mom, don't shit me.
You know you arranged it.

324
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,750
Joe... When I was 15 I was like you.

325
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,630
I was miserable.

326
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,291
I'll tell you.

327
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,625
I'll tell you a little secret now
about my life.

328
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,087
You know what I did once?

329
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:22,636
I locked myself up in the bathroom
and I tried to kill myself.

330
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,135
Mom...

331
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,597
This music... makes me wanna cry.

332
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,189
Come on, mom... Mom!

333
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,442
Come here!

334
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,153
Come here!

335
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:41,031
Girls, you are in the wrong place.

336
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:55,923
In the sixties...

337
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,471
...believed in things!

338
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,927
Oh, Joe, come on, dance!

339
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,813
I don't wanna, leave me alone.

340
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:11,310
- Why? Come on, dance.
- I hate it.

341
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,515
- It's your birthday!
- I hate dancing!

342
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,120
Dance!
Let's steal it away!

343
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,869
My parents thought they understood me,
but they didn't, of course.

344
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,546
I'm thirsty!

345
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,979
- God, I hate her! I could kill her.
- Come on...

346
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,943
She's such fun,
she's fantastic.

347
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:01,822
- What is this thing?
- It's an Italian Frisbee.

348
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:05,575
Look at Julian,
look at Julian dancing.

349
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,911
Is she pathetic!

350
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,955
She's just happy,
and you're ashamed of her.

351
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,464
Ashamed? What do you mean ashamed?

352
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,086
Come on, let's get out of here.

353
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,703
Where is Joe?

354
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:02,089
<i>Once I had an old banjo,
the strings were made of twine.</i>

355
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:06,720
<i>And the only tune that I could play
was Trouble on my Mind.</i>

356
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,892
<i>Shady Grow, my little love.</i>

357
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,142
<i>Shady Grow, my chain.</i>

358
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:15,524
<i>Shady Grow, my little love,
I'm bound to go away.</i>

359
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:28,413
<i>Precious seems my Shady Grow,
standing in my door</i>

360
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:32,910
<i>with shoes and stocking in her hand
and her bare feet on the floor.</i>

361
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,712
I like to hold your arm.

362
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,178
Your mother...

363
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,298
Your mother!

364
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:35,353
Happy birthday to you!

365
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,632
Would you please slow down?

366
00:41:58,892 --> 00:42:00,312
How are you doing?

367
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:46,652
Concetta.

368
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,000
Close all doors.

369
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,146
Why do you do it?

370
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,750
Finally put up the curtains.

371
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,471
Good morning.
Am I disturbing you?

372
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:59,508
No, no.
Carry on, please, carry on.

373
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,069
Would you talk to me, Joe?

374
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,462
I hate that color...

375
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,247
Excuse me...

376
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:33,761
I hate that color.
I don't like it.

377
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,218
Pity, 'cause...
'cause it's beautiful.

378
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,111
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no...

379
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,537
I'm leaving...
I'm really leaving.

380
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,921
When did you start?

381
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:24,394
Yes, Concetta?
No, I'm not in for anybody.

382
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,062
Not even for Marina.

383
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:39,107
Could I have a light?
Could I have a light?

384
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,453
Could I have a light?
Could I have a light?

385
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:44,026
Could I have a light?

386
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,409
Who gave you that stuff?

387
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,956
That fat-ass little hippie
friend of yours?

388
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:15,685
- What are you doing?
- Ma'am, the piano.

389
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:19,357
Ah, yes, come right in.

390
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:25,239
Please, put it here.
It's so beautiful!

391
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:29,792
It's so black! I was expecting it.
So beautiful!

392
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,254
I get new pianos when I move,

393
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,419
and I feel so guilty, because
they're so terribly heavy...

394
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:40,341
Truly heavy, yes...
And so beautiful.

395
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,470
Please, a broom.

396
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:49,564
- Wow!
- Ah, yes...

397
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,189
It just exploded...

398
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:57,573
Like a bomb.
You want it?

399
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,397
And what would I do with it?

400
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,872
When I look at you
and your friends.

401
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,037
You scare me.

402
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:14,622
I feel like I'm on Mars.

403
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:17,666
I'm done.

404
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,335
Maybe it's because you're
all unhappy.

405
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:25,091
Or neurotic. I don't know.

406
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,803
I don't find it very touching.

407
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:31,814
I think it's awful.
The worst is you're just too young.

408
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:36,058
Maybe my mother felt the same way
about me and it's just the same thing.

409
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,067
Am I boring you?

410
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:48,576
I come from a world where...
where singing and dreaming

411
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,656
and creating, they mean something,
it's not just...

412
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:56,538
Oh, Jesus!

413
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:06,467
You know how long it's been since
you've told me one of your dreams?

414
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:31,872
You sing!

415
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:56,808
Joe, Joe, happy birthday.

416
00:48:57,185 --> 00:49:05,855
Joey, Joey, 15 years old.

417
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,667
- Show me!
- No!

418
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:25,804
- Yes!
- Fuck off!

419
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,088
I wanna see that!

420
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,803
You bastard!

421
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,264
Come on, you wanna fight?

422
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:38,388
- Bastard!
- Fucking bitch!

423
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,575
Fucking bitch!

424
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,632
Fucking asshole!

425
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:39,236
<i>Every holy day in church,</i>

426
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:47,036
<i>when I offered my prayers
to God,</i>

427
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:54,879
<i>a handsome and gallant
young man</i>

428
00:52:56,048 --> 00:53:01,928
<i>would keep offering
himself to my gaze.</i>

429
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:07,563
<i>Our lips remained sealed,</i>

430
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:17,602
<i>but our eyes spoke
what our hearts meant.</i>

431
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:43,006
<i>Hidden by darkness,</i>

432
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:51,559
<i>yesterday he came to me:</i>

433
00:53:53,231 --> 00:54:00,951
<i>"I'm a student
living in poverty..."</i>

434
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,898
<i>San Lorenzo's monster,</i>

435
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,990
<i>today I kill you,
tomorrow I'll be sorry.</i>

436
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:44,323
<i>San Lorenzo's monster, today I kill
you, tomorrow I'll be sorry.</i>

437
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:07,562
- Who taught you? You look like a nurse.
- What?

438
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:19,107
Do you know what happened today?

439
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,819
Billy Martin's left the Yankees.

440
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,410
Retired.

441
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,275
God, he was great!

442
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:31,578
He brought the Yankees
two world championships,

443
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,619
one world series...

444
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:39,298
You know baseball? No,
you wouldn't know. You're Italian.

445
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,803
All you guys ever do
is play soccer.

446
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:46,177
He was the greatest manager
since Casey Stengel.

447
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:51,313
I don't know why he left.
I don't know.

448
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,233
Why he had to leave?

449
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,215
Come here!

450
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:35,596
Two beers, very cold.

451
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,232
I don't want a beer,
I want an ice-cream cone.

452
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,065
Ice-cream.

453
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:47,073
But you're American.
I was in New York long time ago.

454
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,453
Hey, I'm from New York
too, from Brooklyn!

455
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:55,000
I was a bartender there. I used
to make drinks, cocktails, you know?

456
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,247
Manhattan, Martini, chuc, chuc...

457
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:05,709
- Where did you find him?
- Out there.

458
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,507
- Now let's talk.
- What?

459
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,110
Tell me all about you.

460
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,840
So, don't you talk?

461
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,378
- I'm listening, you know?
- He's American.

462
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,628
<i>Listen to the ground.</i>

463
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,755
<i>There is movement all around.</i>

464
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:55,512
<i>There is something goin' down
and I can feel it.</i>

465
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:58,385
<i>On the waves of the air,</i>

466
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:00,444
<i>There is dancin' out there.</i>

467
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:04,234
<i>If it's somethin' we can share,
we can steal it.</i>

468
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:09,614
<i>And that sweet city woman,
she moves through the light,</i>

469
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,945
<i>controlling my mind and my soul.</i>

470
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:17,953
<i>When you reach out for me
yeah, and the feelin' is bright.</i>

471
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,620
<i>Night fever.</i>

472
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,964
<i>We know how to do it.</i>

473
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:30,166
<i>Night fever.</i>

474
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,894
<i>We know how to show it.</i>

475
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,600
<i>Here I am.</i>

476
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,230
Now let's dance old fashion,
like a man and a woman.

477
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,608
How do you say it in English?
Cheek to cheek.

478
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:47,476
I'm...
I'm looking for someone.

479
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:49,282
What?

480
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,485
I can't find them.

481
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,742
What the fuck is he saying?

482
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,410
What are you saying?
Come here, gorgeous!

483
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:10,965
Giuseppe!

484
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:37,945
Giuseppe!

485
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:06,827
Happy birthday, Joe.

486
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,282
I really miss dad.

487
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,873
You don't miss him, do you?

488
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:06,102
Mom.

489
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:09,847
I'm cold.

490
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,238
Joe, come on.

491
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,947
Come on, I'll put you to bed.

492
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:31,211
Right over here you'll have a good sleep.

493
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:39,666
Two steps. That's a boy.
That's a baby.

494
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,120
I don't remember buying you
those sexy underpants, Joe.

495
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,578
- I bought them.
- Where?

496
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:16,292
Somewhere around Piazza de Spagna.

497
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,336
I have to go to the bathroom.

498
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,570
Fuck, I can't pee.

499
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,172
I'll help you.

500
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,925
Do you remember when you were little
and you'd wait to pee

501
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:13,143
till you got a new bicycle?

502
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,420
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God!

503
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:49,093
- How long will he sleep?
- 3 to 4 months.

504
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:53,269
No, sleep.

505
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:56,103
When he'll wake up,
he'll feel weak.

506
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:05,857
He will be very hungry.
Give him something to eat.

507
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:10,873
And talk to him.
Talk to him a lot.

508
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:16,578
I'll leave some milk for him
in case he wakes up.

509
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:19,172
He'll wake up in about 24 hours.

510
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,720
You know how to get out?

511
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:33,967
Don't worry, you owe me nothing, but
there's something you could do for me.

512
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,932
- What?
- I'd like to take a picture.

513
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:39,902
A picture?

514
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:42,403
Thanks.

515
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:48,818
Bye.

516
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,007
Yes?

517
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,941
- Hi!
- Sshhh! Joe's sleep.

518
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,815
- Sleep?
- He is sick.

519
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:15,616
Poor thing.

520
01:07:16,742 --> 01:07:19,662
- Let me say hello to him.
- No!

521
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,885
What's wrong with you, Caterina?

522
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,231
Sit down.

523
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,691
What are you trying to do?

524
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:52,239
Put your legs here.

525
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:01,497
You are so goddamn American!

526
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:05,169
I can't!

527
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:12,548
Enough!
Enough!

528
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,888
Why don't we go away someplace
for a week?

529
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:25,185
To Morocco.

530
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:30,824
Let's go alone.

531
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,775
Just the two of us.

532
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:35,152
What do you think?

533
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,290
You need a lover.

534
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:51,880
Cunt!

535
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:15,994
I don't wanna sing anymore.

536
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,318
What?

537
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:33,381
- I don't wanna sing anymore!
- No, Caterina, no...

538
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:37,514
Don't cry...

539
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:42,047
Don't cry, please.

540
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,571
I don't wanna sing anymore, Joe.

541
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,166
I have to talk to you later.

542
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,650
- Who are you?
- I'm Mustafa.

543
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,780
- Are you Joe's friend?
- Yes.

544
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,157
What do you want?

545
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:27,407
I was thinking to steal your car.

546
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,413
I wanna talk to you.

547
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:33,956
Not here...

548
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,916
Not here...
At my house.

549
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:51,808
Take the stairs.

550
01:11:58,481 --> 01:11:59,821
Lock well the door.

551
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:24,548
Please, sit down.
Beautiful, ah?

552
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:26,715
Be right back.

553
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:29,261
Prepare you mint tea,
Arab style.

554
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,506
The best you ever tried.

555
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:51,657
Look, forget....
Forget the Arab tea.

556
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:57,673
Do you sell the stuff
to my son?

557
01:12:58,666 --> 01:12:59,876
Do you?

558
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:03,839
Do you?

559
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:15,432
Sit down.

560
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,359
Why do you do this?

561
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:28,412
I must eat.

562
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:33,453
That's bullshit, you know?
It's really an excuse.

563
01:13:33,785 --> 01:13:35,285
Why don't you get a job?

564
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:36,958
Get a job!

565
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,168
You don't get a job
because you hate to work.

566
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,630
You really believe I haven't
looked for work?

567
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:50,552
You're right. I hate to work
because there is no work.

568
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:59,725
You have something stronger
that I can put in the tea?

569
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,901
I'm sorry, my religion
doesn't allow alcohol.

570
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,979
You're religious, ah...
I see.

571
01:14:09,988 --> 01:14:13,318
- Did you do that?
- Yes, he's walking, you see?

572
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:16,536
- Yeah, it's good.
- Do you know where he's going?

573
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,372
No. Where?

574
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:22,627
You know? You're his mother.
You didn't know him better than I.

575
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:25,804
I don't know.

576
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:28,717
He's coming here.

577
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:35,885
Does he come here often?

578
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:40,640
Yes... Even when
he doesn't need to buy.

579
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:46,271
He lays on the bed and talks and talks.
We're friends.

580
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:49,146
- What does he talk about?
- Everything. You.

581
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:52,275
He's different from the others.

582
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:56,577
- Different?
- He's very lonely. You know that.

583
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:18,309
- How much is that cost?
- 200 thousand liras a gram.

584
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,601
What? Are you kidding me?

585
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,557
That's... that's... absolutely awful.
It's poison!

586
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:29,154
It's more expensive than caviar,
diamonds or truffles.

587
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:32,738
I only get a small 10 per cent.

588
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:34,449
Where does Joe get that kind of money?

589
01:15:34,656 --> 01:15:37,826
He steals it from you,
haven't you noticed?

590
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,873
- You like Joe, don't you?
- Very much.

591
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:46,044
- He's your friend.
- Yes.

592
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:51,625
I have... a thought, an idea.

593
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:55,006
A proposition to make you.

594
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:59,144
I'll give you money.
I'll give you lots of money.

595
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,222
I'll write you a check.
Only promise me that you'll tell...

596
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,354
...Joe that you don't have
any more of this.

597
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:06,442
Don't worry.
I'm closing the shop.

598
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,152
I saved some money
to buy a plane ticket.

599
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:11,781
I'm going back to my country.

600
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:16,105
You're happy?
Don't blush.

601
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:19,414
Don't talk to me that way.
I could be your mother.

602
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:21,081
My mother blush too.

603
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:23,995
Here, take it.

604
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:26,963
Wait... wait.

605
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:30,548
Take it. You'll need it.

606
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:32,917
No, I don't want it, no!

607
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,430
Take it.
Joe will need it.

608
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:11,166
Ah, they're beautiful.

609
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:23,389
Far from you,
there's no joy for me.

610
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:44,739
- Joe!
- Hi.

611
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:03,971
- Lipstick?
- No.

612
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,393
Good. I'm preparing you
a delicious dinner.

613
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,401
Ma!

614
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:17,606
Good, good...

615
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:27,829
It's a French style souffle.

616
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:32,462
- In candle light?
- Fancy.

617
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,875
Fancy!

618
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:40,046
You now have 19 minutes
and 45 seconds to get dressed.

619
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:43,553
- 19 minutes?
- And 45 seconds!

620
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:56,398
Come on, come on, come on...

621
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,275
You like your new watch?

622
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,199
Thank you.

623
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,050
Oh, my God!

624
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:22,005
Shit, the souffle.

625
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,356
God, this souffle looks awful.

626
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:49,080
It's genius, Joe!
It's... it's an inspiration.

627
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:52,366
It's a master piece.
I don't know how you did this.

628
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:53,793
I never could have done this.

629
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,711
It looks like an Italian Frisbee.

630
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,091
Maybe...

631
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:05,719
Ma, just 'cause you're my mother
doesn't mean you have to eat it.

632
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:07,505
Put a little salt on it, darling.

633
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,600
God, it's awful.

634
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:17,981
It sucks.

635
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:20,016
I fucked it up.

636
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,191
Let's have some champagne, Joe, OK?

637
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,780
God, I hate to open champagne bottles.

638
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:33,696
It's like an explosion,
like a missile going off.

639
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,457
Tell me when it's over.

640
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:41,836
Tell me when it's over.

641
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,592
Tell me when it's over.

642
01:21:09,574 --> 01:21:10,744
To Joe.

643
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,333
You wanna know why I take dope?

644
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,002
'Cause I don't give a shit.

645
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:25,795
I see.

646
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:28,176
I just don't give a shit.

647
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:33,222
About what?
About me?

648
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:38,814
What are you talking about?
I don't give a shit about anything!

649
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:43,112
Why?
Why, Joe?

650
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,235
I've got nothing to lose.

651
01:21:47,737 --> 01:21:51,617
That's because you've got a mother
who gives you everything.

652
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:55,827
No, no, ma, that's not it. If you
didn't give me the money I'd steal it.

653
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:00,456
I believe you.

654
01:22:10,635 --> 01:22:12,255
I need two fixes a day.

655
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:17,929
I can't watch you
killing yourself.

656
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:21,477
If I don't have it, I get sick.

657
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:27,566
I get cramps, I sweat,
I chill all over...

658
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,281
Then I take a shot
and everything is beautiful.

659
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,239
It all goes away.

660
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:37,076
Shooting up makes me feel wonderful.

661
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,696
How can I help you?

662
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:46,631
Leave me alone.
Just go away!

663
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:51,426
I don't like you helping me.
Leave me alone.

664
01:22:56,347 --> 01:22:58,097
Oh, God, I'm sick!

665
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,442
I don't have any more of the stuff.

666
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,110
You never could understand me.

667
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,090
Joe, come here.

668
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,350
I can help you, Joe.

669
01:23:43,269 --> 01:23:44,809
I bought something for you.

670
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,188
What?

671
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:12,255
- Where did you get it?
- Mustafa.

672
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,920
Oh, God.

673
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:19,347
Thank you.

674
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:34,066
Here, hold this.
Careful, careful.

675
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:35,815
Thank you.

676
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:41,621
Take it easy.

677
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:49,634
No, back and forth,
back and forth. That's it.

678
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:53,419
Back and forth, come on.

679
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,350
Thank you.

680
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:14,113
Fucking shit, I don't have
any more goddamn needles!

681
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,202
I'm gonna die.

682
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:21,489
I'm gonna die.
Damn it!

683
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:24,909
You forgot the needle!

684
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,277
Don't call the doctor, please.

685
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:03,738
God!

686
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,870
What have I done to you, Joe?

687
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:09,788
What have I done to you?

688
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:18,923
Don't leave me alone, please.

689
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:27,523
I'm sorry, Joe.

690
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:50,069
- Hi.
- Hi.

691
01:30:50,988 --> 01:30:52,158
What are you doing here?

692
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:56,994
Sit down. I prepared you
a delicious breakfast.

693
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:05,768
She's gone out of town.
To Parma.

694
01:32:07,648 --> 01:32:08,768
I know.

695
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,833
He won't recognize you.

696
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,850
Maestro!

697
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:46,061
I came a long way to see you.

698
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,187
I'm sorry I stopped writing you.

699
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:54,608
You don't know who I am, do you?

700
01:33:18,385 --> 01:33:20,255
I spent so much time in this room...

701
01:33:31,398 --> 01:33:32,608
I feel dizzy.

702
01:33:44,578 --> 01:33:48,118
You were a tyrant.
I didn't believe in myself.

703
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:52,705
You taught me how to use my voice.

704
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:54,667
How to take care of it.

705
01:33:54,755 --> 01:33:58,005
That it was beautiful.
All that mattered was my voice.

706
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:01,264
And you're vane,
you are!

707
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:04,468
You're very selfish.

708
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:08,440
Ahhh, you're looking for the spotlight.

709
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,900
The piano's been covered.

710
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:30,746
What's this?
Where's the piano?

711
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:40,129
Do you remember when you told me
one day I'd hate my voice?

712
01:34:41,051 --> 01:34:42,471
I don't wanna sing anymore.

713
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:45,850
I have rehearsals for Ballo.
I don't wanna go.

714
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:50,187
I hate my voice. That's what I came here
to talk to you about.

715
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:53,556
I needed to talk to you about it.
I'm finished.

716
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:55,145
I don't wanna sing.

717
01:34:56,775 --> 01:35:01,025
Can you hear me?
Hear me! Listen to me!

718
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:02,909
I've gotta talk to you.

719
01:35:06,243 --> 01:35:11,923
<i>May the wind be gentle.</i>

720
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:31,805
<i>May the wind be gentle,</i>

721
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:40,609
<i>may the waves be calm,</i>

722
01:35:41,695 --> 01:35:50,195
<i>may all the elements</i>

723
01:35:50,287 --> 01:35:58,747
<i>respond favorably to our wishes.</i>

724
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:07,393
I used to sing this to my son
when he was a little boy.

725
01:36:33,205 --> 01:36:36,495
- See you soon.
- Kiss. Hurry. Hurry.

726
01:36:40,504 --> 01:36:42,764
I'm so glad to see you!

727
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,340
How did you find me, darling?

728
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:51,143
- Marina.
- Thank you for coming.

729
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:05,652
This is where he kissed me
the first time.

730
01:37:07,656 --> 01:37:09,486
- Who?
- Your father.

731
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:12,237
- Where?
- Here...

732
01:37:12,786 --> 01:37:14,906
- Here, where?
- Here.

733
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:29,204
I bet I can find it.
The house that we lived in.

734
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:34,413
It had these two enormous,
gigantic walnut trees.

735
01:38:34,618 --> 01:38:38,288
We lived there for about... a year.

736
01:38:38,705 --> 01:38:40,705
Then we moved to the sea, near Rome.

737
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,128
I think it's this way.

738
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:46,961
- Are we lost?
- Not at all.

739
01:38:47,631 --> 01:38:48,761
Not at all.

740
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:55,347
What is it, do you see the house?

741
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:57,642
- No, I know where we are!
- Where?

742
01:38:57,682 --> 01:39:00,732
That is the farm where
he used to get fresh bread.

743
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:04,314
Mom, I'm hungry.
I haven't eaten since last night.

744
01:39:45,355 --> 01:39:49,435
I couldn't find our house,
but look where we are.

745
01:40:02,122 --> 01:40:06,842
Joe, this is Verdi's house!

746
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:11,762
This is where he lived,
this is where he wrote everything!

747
01:40:11,798 --> 01:40:13,088
All his operas.

748
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:16,755
He lived inside there.
He'd look out the window...

749
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:20,768
...and he'd see a little
old hunchback peasant.

750
01:40:21,266 --> 01:40:23,136
Then Rigoletto is what he'd write.

751
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:26,484
Or he'd look out and he,
I don't know, he'd see

752
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,689
the Po river and it would be
the Nile to him...

753
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:34,203
He saw Egypt, he saw Venice,
he saw everything,

754
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:36,407
he saw the world in this little house.

755
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:41,660
- You'd like to come and see it?
- Not particularly.

756
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:47,503
Not particularly?
Joe!

757
01:40:51,046 --> 01:40:52,506
This is my roots, Joe.

758
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:55,970
This is my family you're talking about.

759
01:40:56,926 --> 01:41:00,426
How can you be like this?
He's like a father to me.

760
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:06,636
You don't care about anything!

761
01:41:12,025 --> 01:41:15,695
You're a lost person.
A junkie.

762
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,910
That's all.

763
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:37,049
Are you fucking crazy?
Are you nuts?

764
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:39,175
What are you trying to do?
Kill me?

765
01:41:42,806 --> 01:41:47,516
Would you relax, Joe? It's not
a major accident, it's a flat tire.

766
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,520
It'll take two minutes to fix.

767
01:41:50,814 --> 01:41:51,904
Howling.

768
01:41:53,191 --> 01:41:54,321
God!

769
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,707
- Mom, do you want me to help you?
- No.

770
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:18,513
Go listen to the jukebox box.

771
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:24,931
And stop staring over my shoulder!
It makes me nervous.

772
01:43:14,439 --> 01:43:18,529
Some times, being your mother
can be a real pain in the ass.

773
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:25,332
Stop! Shit!

774
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:28,156
You just wait!
Stop!

775
01:44:31,683 --> 01:44:34,523
- A problem?
- Yes.

776
01:45:34,037 --> 01:45:35,157
Castro.

777
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:42,423
I wish I had a pair of his boots.

778
01:45:43,338 --> 01:45:47,718
Now I'll tell you something
that will shock you as American.

779
01:45:48,343 --> 01:45:52,223
- I... I'm communist.
- What do you mean?

780
01:45:53,306 --> 01:45:56,016
You are American, I'm communist.

781
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:04,111
Stop the car! Stop.
No, stop!

782
01:46:04,484 --> 01:46:06,194
- Stop!
- I offend you?

783
01:46:22,752 --> 01:46:24,752
Be calm.
Go ahead.

784
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:56,037
Here I am.

785
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:09,553
See, this is culatello.
You don't understand my language,

786
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:11,512
but I tell you all the same.

787
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:16,386
- A bottle of Sauvignon.
- This ham... I'm coming.

788
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:20,182
This ham is done here only...

789
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:28,229
and has to be cured in the mist,
in the open air, and after 2 years...

790
01:47:31,237 --> 01:47:36,987
- 6 year ago, in Cuba... Cuba...
- Yes! Cuba! Cuba!

791
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:40,754
- This is from last year.
- Thank you.

792
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:44,673
Excuse me.

793
01:47:53,134 --> 01:47:57,054
- Fidel... Castro.
- Yes, Fidel!

794
01:47:57,805 --> 01:48:04,475
Same boat, 2 men.
Fidel and me. You get me?

795
01:48:05,271 --> 01:48:07,021
Fishing, fishing.

796
01:48:07,315 --> 01:48:09,725
I fished a fish this big.

797
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:14,411
Sure, and Fidel very little fish.
Very jealous.

798
01:48:14,489 --> 01:48:15,619
I bet!

799
01:48:16,491 --> 01:48:19,161
- Beautiful man, handsome.
- Strong.

800
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:22,413
Very, very jealous for my big fish.

801
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,210
Thank you.

802
01:48:31,464 --> 01:48:34,514
Beautiful, black, sexy...

803
01:48:34,592 --> 01:48:36,222
God, what an asshole.

804
01:48:40,723 --> 01:48:41,853
Is that for us?

805
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:49,020
No... no... he's a punk.
He's a little punk.

806
01:48:55,821 --> 01:49:01,291
You're strong too.
Look at those shoulders.

807
01:49:01,327 --> 01:49:05,747
See those strong arms!
You've done a lot of sports?

808
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:07,580
- A little, before.
- What?

809
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:10,957
- But now...
- Not now?

810
01:49:12,004 --> 01:49:14,134
- No?
- Now yes or no?

811
01:49:16,425 --> 01:49:19,425
Excuse me, I'd like you
to try this wine.

812
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:24,429
A very little sandwich
for a very strong man.

813
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:30,403
Ah, thank you.
I'll show you a game.

814
01:49:30,439 --> 01:49:35,529
It's Sauvignon,
Treviano and malvasia.

815
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:44,996
You're dirty.

816
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:36,213
Bravo! Very well,
you didn't break a single glass.

817
01:50:37,173 --> 01:50:40,593
- This is pure malvasia.
- The bill.

818
01:50:41,761 --> 01:50:42,851
Three thousand.

819
01:50:49,101 --> 01:50:52,441
I'm sorry, but that's my son.

820
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:04,580
Do you have a room?

821
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:11,326
<i>They dragged her in bonds</i>

822
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:16,342
<i>to her terrible fate.</i>

823
01:51:17,505 --> 01:51:21,545
<i>Carrying my child,</i>

824
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:26,635
<i>I followed her in tears.</i>

825
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:43,200
<i>In vain the poor woman
tried to stop and bless me!</i>

826
01:51:43,739 --> 01:51:48,119
<i>Shouting filthy oaths,</i>

827
01:51:48,661 --> 01:51:51,831
<i>they stabbed her with their daggers...</i>

828
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:57,462
<i>...as they drove her to the flames,
the murderers!</i>

829
01:52:10,224 --> 01:52:14,774
I didn't want to touch him.
I wanted to be touching you.

830
01:52:22,111 --> 01:52:25,661
You're right.
He was an asshole.

831
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:29,657
He was a jerk.

832
01:52:54,894 --> 01:52:56,274
I'm scared too.

833
01:53:08,032 --> 01:53:12,372
My baby! My baby!
Your back is so soft.

834
01:53:23,672 --> 01:53:28,092
- Let's not fight anymore!
- Your face is a mess.

835
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:32,468
I'll clean it up.

836
01:53:39,438 --> 01:53:41,898
- It's good.
- Hold still.

837
01:54:24,358 --> 01:54:25,648
I love you, Joe!

838
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:31,028
- I love you, Joe!
- No, you don't.

839
01:54:31,866 --> 01:54:36,446
You hate me. You never loved me.
You always hated me!

840
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:39,420
You're fucking crazy!
You're sick, you're sick!

841
01:54:39,832 --> 01:54:42,252
You never loved me
and you'll never love me!

842
01:54:42,293 --> 01:54:44,803
You hate me, you hate me, you hate me!

843
01:54:45,004 --> 01:54:47,844
You're a fucking bitch!
You bitch!

844
01:55:10,988 --> 01:55:13,118
If only we could have found our house...

845
01:55:14,617 --> 01:55:16,487
It was so important to me.

846
01:55:16,535 --> 01:55:21,745
I wanted you to see it.
I wanted you to know.

847
01:55:22,583 --> 01:55:24,753
This is very hard for me to say, Joe.

848
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:27,588
I wanted to tell you.

849
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:34,351
I tried to tell you.
I didn't know how.

850
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:39,350
I thought that if we could see
the house that we lived in.

851
01:55:40,726 --> 01:55:44,056
The house that we lived in
with your father.

852
01:55:45,022 --> 01:55:46,362
Not with Douglas.

853
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:49,146
But with your real father.

854
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,420
Make a right.

855
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:20,389
We're here.

856
01:56:30,359 --> 01:56:32,489
- What?
- We're here.

857
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:41,834
Go.

858
01:56:43,372 --> 01:56:44,792
Go, go, go.

859
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:52,876
Continue, please.

860
01:57:33,005 --> 01:57:34,915
That's it.
Now let's see, boys.

861
01:57:34,965 --> 01:57:36,625
Let's see what you did.

862
01:57:42,723 --> 01:57:45,683
Bigfoot, Bigfoot,
you stepped on my star.

863
01:57:45,768 --> 01:57:46,888
Oh, I'm sorry.

864
01:57:50,898 --> 01:57:53,228
Teacher, someone came.

865
01:57:54,943 --> 01:57:56,283
Your shoes.

866
01:57:57,988 --> 01:58:02,618
Your shoes...
Put them there. Look.

867
01:58:02,868 --> 01:58:04,538
Put them there,
with the rest.

868
01:58:21,386 --> 01:58:22,806
Come closer,
I didn't hear you.

869
01:58:32,189 --> 01:58:34,019
You'll tell me later, right?

870
01:58:36,235 --> 01:58:38,695
Let's see what this planetarium
looks like.

871
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:40,913
Let's see.

872
01:58:46,203 --> 01:58:47,373
Listen, Bigfoot...

873
01:58:48,997 --> 01:58:50,957
Fill that gap in front of you.

874
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:52,500
There, right in front of you.

875
01:58:54,461 --> 01:58:55,671
Come right in.

876
01:58:57,172 --> 01:58:58,222
Good morning.

877
01:58:58,507 --> 01:58:59,587
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

878
01:58:59,591 --> 01:59:00,721
Calm down.

879
01:59:07,224 --> 01:59:08,314
Come, let's make room.

880
01:59:08,851 --> 01:59:10,691
Mind your feet,
you'll ruin everything.

881
01:59:10,769 --> 01:59:12,899
Yes, yes, you can
take it home.

882
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,550
It's the last day of class...

883
01:59:38,046 --> 01:59:41,006
and when you're back
from the holidays

884
01:59:41,842 --> 01:59:44,722
you'll find...
Why are you laughing, Luigi?

885
01:59:44,761 --> 01:59:45,851
Come on, be nice.

886
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:49,600
When you're back from the holidays,
you'll find right up there

887
01:59:50,058 --> 01:59:52,388
your sky, which I find very beautiful,

888
01:59:53,478 --> 01:59:57,858
in memory of your work
and your imagination.

889
01:59:58,358 --> 02:00:03,068
I don't want to bore you any longer.
Happy holidays for everyone.

890
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:21,511
A kiss...
Happy holidays. Bye.

891
02:00:31,558 --> 02:00:35,188
- Happy holidays, Palmiro.
- Thanks, all the same to you.

892
02:03:13,887 --> 02:03:18,267
He made this moon with 3 eyes,
2 noses and one mouth.

893
02:03:19,226 --> 02:03:21,056
And he stole your shoes.

894
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:26,270
Why do you say he stole my shoes?
Maybe he made a mistake.

895
02:03:33,407 --> 02:03:34,697
I brought your shoes back.

896
02:03:38,662 --> 02:03:40,412
Wait, I'll go take yours.

897
02:03:40,539 --> 02:03:43,459
I mean,
I'll go and get yours.

898
02:03:50,257 --> 02:03:52,967
- Will you drink anything?
- No, thank you.

899
02:03:54,636 --> 02:03:56,636
- Are you English?
- American.

900
02:03:57,097 --> 02:03:59,137
Here they are.
Here.

901
02:04:02,269 --> 02:04:03,729
Do you like my shoes better than...?

902
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:06,020
Do you want my shoes?

903
02:04:06,022 --> 02:04:07,982
You used to speak English
a lot, didn't you?

904
02:04:08,024 --> 02:04:09,364
Many years ago.

905
02:04:10,235 --> 02:04:12,145
I know certain American songs.

906
02:04:14,739 --> 02:04:16,369
You remember you had a son?

907
02:04:22,414 --> 02:04:24,504
I'll play something for you.

908
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,080
Thank you.

909
02:04:37,179 --> 02:04:40,349
He never forgot you.
He looked for you everywhere.

910
02:04:43,393 --> 02:04:45,103
Didn't you wanna know where he was?

911
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:48,110
All he wanted to do was to find you.

912
02:04:50,066 --> 02:04:51,526
It drove him crazy.

913
02:04:51,776 --> 02:04:53,526
After a while he started shooting up.

914
02:04:54,279 --> 02:04:57,989
Heroine.
You know?

915
02:05:00,535 --> 02:05:03,825
We'd shoot up together,
then we'd look for you.

916
02:05:04,247 --> 02:05:05,417
We looked for you, man!

917
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:07,576
You don't believe me?

918
02:05:09,127 --> 02:05:10,207
Look!

919
02:05:11,463 --> 02:05:12,513
Look!

920
02:05:13,548 --> 02:05:14,588
Look!

921
02:06:06,476 --> 02:06:07,726
Where is my son now?

922
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:10,519
He's dead.

923
02:06:14,859 --> 02:06:16,279
He died right in the street.

924
02:06:18,613 --> 02:06:20,283
Nobody came to help.

925
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:25,000
He OD'ed.
Overdosed.

926
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:47,136
Get out.

927
02:06:50,186 --> 02:06:51,556
Get out, please.

928
02:07:16,046 --> 02:07:19,256
- And Caterina, where is she?
- She's rehearsing at Caracalla.

929
02:07:37,108 --> 02:07:41,198
Mom.
Mom.

930
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:25,820
<i>Love and dancing prosper</i>
in these happy halls..<

931
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:32,000
<i>...where life is only</i>
an alluring dream<

932
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:34,500
<i>An alluring dream.</i>

933
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:37,880
<i>Night of sweet moments,</i>
of passion and song..

934
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:40,630
<i>Of passion and song...</i>

935
02:08:40,797 --> 02:08:43,967
<i>Why do you not stay your flight</i>

936
02:08:44,592 --> 02:08:46,642
<i>above the waves of pleasure?</i>

937
02:09:43,735 --> 02:09:45,065
It's fine like this, thanks.

938
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:52,580
Renaldo, Francesco, Stefano,
what did we say?

939
02:09:52,619 --> 02:09:56,499
They're killing each other here.
Let's remember what we'd said.

940
02:09:56,623 --> 02:09:59,713
Excuse me, what are you doing here?
We're at work. Out!

941
02:10:01,294 --> 02:10:03,174
Let's remember what we had said.

942
02:10:05,465 --> 02:10:07,465
Renaldo, Oscar's song.

943
02:10:09,761 --> 02:10:10,851
Keep calm.

944
02:10:10,887 --> 02:10:12,507
<i>Keep calm.</i>

945
02:10:12,597 --> 02:10:16,387
<i>At least you can
tell me how he's dressed.</i>

946
02:10:17,393 --> 02:10:23,533
<i>You'd like to know
how he is dressed...</i>

947
02:10:23,817 --> 02:10:30,027
<i>...when that's the very thing
he wants to hide.</i>

948
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:36,700
<i>Oscar knows but won't tell.</i>

949
02:10:44,963 --> 02:10:46,053
Marina!

950
02:10:46,631 --> 02:10:47,761
Where's my mother?

951
02:10:50,009 --> 02:10:55,179
<i>You'd like to know
how she is dressed...</i>

952
02:10:55,515 --> 02:10:56,635
Where is she?

953
02:10:57,433 --> 02:10:58,563
Guess.

954
02:11:00,478 --> 02:11:05,568
<i>Concealment is in vain, Amelia.</i>

955
02:11:05,817 --> 02:11:11,317
<i>You are that angel!</i>

956
02:11:13,449 --> 02:11:16,369
<i>I love you, yes, I love you and in tears</i>

957
02:11:16,744 --> 02:11:19,334
<i>...I throw myself at your feet...</i>

958
02:11:20,123 --> 02:11:22,963
<i>...while an avenging knife...</i>

959
02:11:23,334 --> 02:11:25,964
<i>...lurks in hiding for you.</i>

960
02:11:26,629 --> 02:11:30,379
<i>You will be a corpse tomorrow...</i>

961
02:11:30,425 --> 02:11:32,795
<i>...if you stay here.</i>

962
02:11:32,844 --> 02:11:33,974
<i>Save yourself,</i>

963
02:11:34,095 --> 02:11:36,715
<i>go, leave me, flee...</i>

964
02:11:37,932 --> 02:11:39,022
Five minutes.

965
02:11:42,103 --> 02:11:44,443
Five minutes, please!

966
02:11:52,322 --> 02:11:53,572
Five minutes!

967
02:11:54,782 --> 02:11:56,492
Five minutes!

968
02:12:01,372 --> 02:12:04,462
Will you please remain silent?

969
02:12:05,293 --> 02:12:08,343
Please, turn down the volume.

970
02:12:14,135 --> 02:12:17,555
Edward, you never get anywhere on time.

971
02:12:18,222 --> 02:12:19,932
They wouldn't allow me to come in here.

972
02:12:29,901 --> 02:12:32,741
Look what an incredible present I found.

973
02:12:32,946 --> 02:12:36,116
It's a score of Ballo
autographed by Callas.

974
02:12:36,783 --> 02:12:37,953
Isn't it incredible?

975
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:42,368
Caterina is beyond all that now.

976
02:12:42,747 --> 02:12:44,747
I suppose this must be
a very tricky theater.

977
02:12:44,749 --> 02:12:45,999
How's she been singing?

978
02:12:46,751 --> 02:12:49,961
She's not singing.
She's speaking her role.

979
02:12:50,588 --> 02:12:53,588
- That's very unusual for her.
- You don't understand anything.

980
02:13:26,541 --> 02:13:28,421
Now you're in love
with your father?

981
02:13:29,085 --> 02:13:30,745
You really screwed me up.

982
02:13:31,921 --> 02:13:34,091
- I'm half Italian.
- You're American.

983
02:13:34,382 --> 02:13:36,552
It says so on your birth certificate.

984
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:39,760
You were born in New York.
Your father was Douglas.

985
02:13:40,096 --> 02:13:42,136
You know you'll go to jail
for forgery.

986
02:13:43,975 --> 02:13:46,595
They'd never arrest me.
I'm crazy.

987
02:13:47,186 --> 02:13:48,936
- I really am.
- You're kidding.

988
02:13:51,357 --> 02:13:54,567
I'm teasing, darling,
I'm teasing.

989
02:14:11,669 --> 02:14:12,799
Why did you break up?

990
02:14:21,262 --> 02:14:25,222
He hated... me.
My, my voice.

991
02:14:29,479 --> 02:14:31,939
He wanted... something different.

992
02:14:35,735 --> 02:14:36,855
He was...

993
02:14:37,904 --> 02:14:39,034
...selfish.

994
02:14:44,410 --> 02:14:46,000
He was in love with his mother.

995
02:14:48,998 --> 02:14:50,118
To your places!

996
02:14:50,875 --> 02:14:54,085
- To your places!
- To your places, please!

997
02:14:54,212 --> 02:14:55,552
Everyone in place!

998
02:15:00,468 --> 02:15:01,638
I have to go.

999
02:15:36,337 --> 02:15:39,757
Everyone to your places!
Break is over!

1000
02:15:42,927 --> 02:15:44,887
Please, to your places!

1001
02:16:06,117 --> 02:16:11,827
Yes, I understand, but tell me
what the finale's feeling is.

1002
02:16:11,873 --> 02:16:13,423
But, are you ready to sing or not?

1003
02:16:13,499 --> 02:16:14,629
Caterina...

1004
02:16:14,667 --> 02:16:17,167
Look, Caterina, you're a woman
who's deeply in love...

1005
02:16:17,378 --> 02:16:21,878
...and tries to fight this conspiracy
no matter what...

1006
02:16:21,966 --> 02:16:24,966
- Come, come on.
- But let me finish talking.

1007
02:16:49,994 --> 02:16:51,044
It's terrible.

1008
02:16:52,038 --> 02:16:53,328
To see me?

1009
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:01,760
Is it true?

1010
02:17:03,966 --> 02:17:06,676
- But, what?
- Our son.

1011
02:17:08,512 --> 02:17:09,682
He's right there.

1012
02:17:33,329 --> 02:17:36,249
Joe, Mustafa's gone.

1013
02:17:54,058 --> 02:17:57,228
<i>Once more,</i>

1014
02:17:57,311 --> 02:18:00,561
<i>farewell.</i>

1015
02:18:01,315 --> 02:18:04,565
<i>For the last time,</i>

1016
02:18:04,652 --> 02:18:09,702
<i>farewell.</i>

1017
02:18:10,449 --> 02:18:15,369
<i>Farewell.</i>

1018
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:18,960
<i>Take this farewell of mine too!</i>

1019
02:18:19,625 --> 02:18:23,335
<i>Help! Help!</i>

1020
02:18:23,796 --> 02:18:26,506
<i>Oh, heaven!
He has been slain!</i>

1021
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:29,010
<i>- By whom?
- Where is the assassin?</i>

1022
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:31,100
<i>Here!</i>

1023
02:18:32,179 --> 02:18:34,519
<i>Renaldo!</i>

1024
02:18:35,182 --> 02:18:39,562
<i>Death and infamy to the traitor!</i>

1025
02:18:39,979 --> 02:18:44,229
<i>Let the sword of vengeance
cut him down!</i>

1026
02:18:44,317 --> 02:18:48,697
<i>Death and infamy to the traitor!</i>

1027
02:18:48,821 --> 02:18:54,161
<i>Death and infamy to the traitor!</i>

1028
02:18:57,413 --> 02:18:58,503
<i>No.</i>

1029
02:18:59,248 --> 02:19:00,668
<i>Let him go!</i>

1030
02:19:01,167 --> 02:19:02,787
<i>Let him go!</i>

1031
02:19:05,463 --> 02:19:11,553
<i>You, listen to me for a moment.</i>

1032
02:19:27,818 --> 02:19:30,648
<i>Mercy for everyone.</i>

1033
02:19:30,946 --> 02:19:34,946
<i>I am master here.</i>

1034
02:19:35,326 --> 02:19:42,996
<i>My pardon...</i>

1035
02:19:43,042 --> 02:19:50,842
<i>...absolves you all.</i>

1036
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:58,060
<i>Merciful God, spare so great</i>

1037
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:03,400
<i>and generous a heart for us.</i>

1038
02:20:03,437 --> 02:20:06,267
<i>He is a ray of Thy divine love,</i>

1039
02:20:06,315 --> 02:20:10,235
<i>merciful God,</i>

1040
02:20:16,033 --> 02:20:22,213
<i>on us poor souls on earth!</i>

1041
02:20:22,623 --> 02:20:28,173
<i>He is a ray of Thy divine love,</i>
