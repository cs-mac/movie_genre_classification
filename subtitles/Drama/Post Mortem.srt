September 17, 1939

19
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:43,307
Where to, folks?!

20
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:46,267
There are Germans behind us!

21
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,587
The Soviets have entered!

22
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,427
Where are you going?
Turn back!

23
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,786
The Russkies have entered!

24
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:06,826
Faster!

25
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:09,786
Germans are behind us...

26
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:46,186
Mrs. Anna! Mrs. Anna!
Where to?

27
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:49,226
I'm looking for my husband.
Where are they?

28
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:52,426
You don't know?
The Soviets attacked at dawn.

29
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:56,346
My husband told me to return
to Cracow immediately.

30
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:01,387
My husband knows
what's he talking about.

31
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:04,426
- Madam...
- They must know that we're safe.

32
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:08,907
Why jeopardize yourself and the kid?
Be reasonable.

33
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:11,387
- Madame, please.
- Start.

34
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,346
Nika!

35
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:28,387
Where are you?!
My God, Nika!

36
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:31,426
Nika...

37
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:35,426
Come, doggie.
Nothing to be scared of.

38
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:38,186
I told you to stick with me!

39
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:41,186
He's alone and scared.
Let's take him along.

40
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:45,467
We can't. We're in a hurry.
He may be waiting for his master.

41
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,707
Excuse me, do you
know where the 8th

42
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:56,226
- Cracow Uhlan Regiment is?
- The uhlans are no more.

43
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,986
And the officers?
Where's the staff?

44
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,907
There's a hospital
in the church.

45
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:08,507
They may know something.
Ask them.

46
00:05:56,746 --> 00:05:59,666
- Is dad there?
- I don't know. We'll see.

47
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:36,346
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti...

48
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,707
- Mom, the coat.
- What coat?

49
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:51,627
Dad's coat.
I can tell by the blue ribbon.

50
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:56,866
Hold this.

51
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:20,587
- What's happening?
- The President's address!

52
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:24,186
The president's address!
Come!

53
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:27,587
...until today has
withstood the onslaught

54
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:31,507
of the overwhelming
German forces,

55
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:37,707
our eastern neighbor
has invaded our lands in violation

56
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:42,387
of covenants, and the immutable
principles of morality.

57
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,306
Warsaw as the capital
is no more!

58
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:50,467
- Who's that?
- Molotov, Soviet Foreign Minister.

59
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:53,947
- The Soviets are everywhere.
- Where are the officers?

60
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:57,986
The POW's are at the station
if they're there.

61
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:02,466
- They were to be transported to Russia.
- Thank you. Hurry up Niki.

62
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:05,546
- You can leave her with me.
- I want to come along.

63
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,786
Wait here.
I'll be back with daddy.

64
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,867
I have another bicycle.
Take this for your husband.

65
00:08:11,987 --> 00:08:15,227
- I'll be right back.
- Grzes, see the lady off.

66
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:18,546
Take the bicycle
and leave it there.

67
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:24,747
September 17, 1939

68
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:28,666
The Bolsheviks have entered.

69
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:33,466
Surrounded by Soviet tanks,
we surrender weapons.

70
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:41,186
They take us for POW's
though there was no war with them.

71
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:45,826
They have separated the officers
and let the soldiers go home,

72
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:48,466
but have retained us, the officers.

73
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:51,987
I'll try to write from time to time
to let you know

74
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:56,786
what happen to me
if I died and didn't return.

75
00:08:56,946 --> 00:09:00,387
Maybe this notebook
will be sent to you.

76
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:03,747
- They're dividing us.
- Wait a minute.

77
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,387
What're you doing?

78
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,826
I've decided to describe
everything I've seen here

79
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:10,586
day by day.

80
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:14,706
The Germans take our soldiers,
the Soviets, our officers.

81
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:17,946
Makes no difference.
Captivity is captivity.

82
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,387
No honor to an officer.

83
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:23,347
- I see only the dark side.
- Meaning?

84
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:26,747
Moscow hasn't signed
the Geneva Convention.

85
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,666
How long do you think
their friendship will last?

86
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:42,586
Hitler declared
a 1000-year-old Reich

87
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:44,826
and communism is forever.

88
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:48,466
Greetings to the representatives
of the German Army.

89
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:51,186
First Lieutenant of the NKVD Kozlov.

90
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:53,747
A thousand years at least.

91
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:58,186
- You never lose your sense of humor.
- My common sense rather.

92
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,387
- How goes it, comrades?
- Fine.

93
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:07,747
Their alliance won't last a year,

94
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:10,666
which means they'll
need us very badly.

95
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:11,946
Who?

96
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:17,387
One transport to Smolensk,
the second, to Belgorod,

97
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,786
and the third to Kharkov.

98
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:24,546
- Anna? Your wife?
- Why, She's in Cracow.

99
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,946
What're you doing here, Anna?
Why aren't you in Cracow?

100
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:34,546
- Where's Nika?
- Andrzej...

101
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:38,946
- Andrzej, I thought...
- Where's Nika?

102
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:41,747
You'll see her
in the presbytery.

103
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,826
What presbytery?

104
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:46,867
What presbytery?

105
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:50,267
Nearby. I have another
bicycle for you. Just change.

106
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:53,586
They're not watching closely.
I got thru with no problem.

107
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:55,586
What do you mean?

108
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,706
I want you to be with us,

109
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,786
to take care of me
and our daughter.

110
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:03,867
Anna, listen to me...

111
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:07,387
You're a wife of a Polish officer.

112
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:10,507
This conversation is pointless.

113
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:16,267
Pointless? I've traveled across
half of Poland to you!

114
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,946
I'm bound by my military pledge.

115
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:26,546
You swore to me...
before God.

116
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:29,987
Till death do us part,
you've forgotten?

117
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,867
I swore to them too.

118
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,347
You just don't love us.

119
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:43,627
- By God, Anna, calm down.
- I beg you...

120
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:49,747
I beg you, Andrzej...

121
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:53,586
No talking to the prisoner!

122
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:56,347
- Andrzej.
- All will be well.

123
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:01,946
- Daddy!
- Niki.

124
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:04,546
Don't go away!

125
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:10,946
Take her.

126
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:15,907
- Take her away.
- Come, darling.

127
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,666
Take care.

128
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:54,987
Nika!

129
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:05,747
Daddy!

130
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,987
Daddy!

131
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,706
Daddy!

132
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:23,867
THE YOUNGEST CAVALRY CAPTAIN...

133
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,987
Maybe the navy blue
would be better?

134
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:43,347
No, thank you, my dear.

135
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:46,227
I thought you were working.

136
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:49,507
I found an old paper
with Andrzej's photo

137
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,586
when he was the youngest
cavalry captain in the Polish Army.

138
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:59,987
Our son lives. He's in captivity,
but he lives.

139
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:06,186
Thank you.

140
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:10,666
- Will you have a speech today?
- Not today.

141
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:15,347
We have to listen to the lecture
of that SS officer... Müller?

142
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:19,347
- I told you.
- We need to buy a new jacket.

143
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:22,267
Müller. Doctor Müller.

144
00:15:35,747 --> 00:15:38,267
Does he have
a scientific degree,

145
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:42,867
- that Müller?
- Yes. He calls himself

146
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:48,227
police government adviser.

147
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,186
Dr. Müller.

148
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:53,347
Jan...

149
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:57,786
...you don't want to go there?

150
00:15:57,946 --> 00:16:02,907
Out of the question.
We all must be there.

151
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:05,826
We can't leave
the chancellor alone.

152
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:09,466
The Germans must believe
that we are of one mind

153
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:12,786
when it comes to the independence
of the university.

154
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:24,387
Cracow, Nov. 6, 1939
German Occupation Zone

155
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,387
Hello... hello.

156
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,266
Yes, Chancellor.
Hello...

157
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:54,347
Gentlemen,

158
00:16:57,827 --> 00:17:01,186
We have been informed
that, at the university,

159
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:07,827
you start classes, seminars
and exams without our consent.

160
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:11,506
You don't seem to realize
the plight you're in.

161
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:14,547
This kind of conduct

162
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:21,907
is a hostile act
against Germany.

163
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:29,547
In fact the university was always
a major hotbed of scientific struggle

164
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:31,746
against Germany, the center
of anti-German propaganda.

165
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,547
The university is closed.

166
00:17:35,627 --> 00:17:39,347
You all are under arrest.
You'll go to a labor camp

167
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:43,787
where you'll have enough time
to think over your behavior until now.

168
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:47,347
- Excuse me...
- Any discussion is useless.

169
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:52,867
I categorically protest
on behalf of the university.

170
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,307
Comments are forbidden.

171
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,666
Whoever will try to disobey

172
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:02,627
orders will be shot.
Chancellor, you go first.

173
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:04,946
November 1939
Camp in Kozielsk, USSR.

174
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:11,946
Everybody fled: Police stations,
high command. I know only one word:

175
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:14,347
- Treason.
- Easy to judge others

176
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:17,627
- when you didn't fight.
- You didn't give me any weapon.

177
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:21,466
The camp does not justify
a breach of rules and conduct.

178
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:25,426
- It's a fitting term: Treason!
- Soviet propaganda, lieutenant!

179
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:28,827
- The truth is quite different.
- Look for it in Romania,

180
00:19:28,946 --> 00:19:32,347
- where our C. -in-C. Has fled.
- Who's guilty

181
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,186
that we were unprepared?

182
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:37,426
History will judge
the guilty of the disaster.

183
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:41,627
Rehearsed platitudes, those, I think
though I have fewer stars than you.

184
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:46,347
- I'm an engineer, I design planes.
- The uniform is an honor.

185
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:50,347
- The Polish uniform.
- Shove the honor. I'd rather fight!

186
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:54,387
Don't jump at each other's throat.
Here? Before the Soviets?

187
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,986
We still take part
in the war.

188
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:04,666
It's all over with us.

189
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,706
Try to find peace with this,
lieutenant.

190
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,787
November 1939
Soviet Occupation Zone

191
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:43,547
The Soviet Red Army
is your only friend.

192
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:47,986
Any further resistance is
pointless.

193
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:51,946
The Soviet Red Army
is your only friend.

194
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:57,946
Only she will liberate
the Polish nation from the war.

195
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:02,547
So that you could
start living in peace.

196
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,186
I can't find it.

197
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:21,426
Silence the baby.

198
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:23,867
- Name?
- Anna.

199
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:29,266
Wife of a cavalry captain,

200
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:32,706
born in Cracow in 1910,
daughter Nika.

201
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:37,547
This checks out. Everything's correct.
So, what is it, citizen?

202
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,946
I already applied twice for travel
documents to Poland...

203
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,387
the General-Gouverenment, that is.

204
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:46,466
To my family.

205
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:49,746
Mussolini envies us already.

206
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:52,986
That's what is in our files.

207
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:55,827
And you were refused twice.
So what now?

208
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:58,946
I've applied again.

209
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,666
Refused!
Next one!

210
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:10,547
I used to live in Cracow before
the war. My family lives there.

211
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:14,547
She's a citizen of the General-
Gouvernement. Can she return there?

212
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,587
No!

213
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:19,347
Let me return to Krakow, please.

214
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:23,827
You can return of course,
but you cannot leave from here.

215
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:27,387
It's clear in black and white that
your husband is held

216
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:31,547
in captivity. Don't you want to
wait till he returns? It's no good.

217
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:36,347
He'll be released and
no one will welcome him.

218
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:40,706
Name?

219
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:53,746
Cracow,
December 24, 1939

220
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:01,787
Where's Ewa?

221
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:06,946
Outside, looking
for the first star.

222
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:10,746
She wanted to look from here,
but it's the blackout...

223
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:14,186
Where's the plate for
an unexpected guest?

224
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,746
I put it over here
a moment ago.

225
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:21,347
This one is for the General.

226
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:33,466
Good.

227
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:48,746
Sir, I report that the first
star has been sighted.

228
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,986
Thank you.

229
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:08,907
Gentlemen...

230
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:13,907
I have no doubts
that in a year's time

231
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:17,666
we'll reminisce about our
present plight with a smile.

232
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:21,266
None of us thought that
the service prepared us

233
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:25,827
only for immediate victories. Defeat
is also part of the soldier's lot...

234
00:25:25,946 --> 00:25:27,627
...and captivity,

235
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:30,746
but also a return home
to resume fighting.

236
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:36,347
You don't lay down your arms before
an enemy but before yourself.

237
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:41,946
So it's only up to you if you
remain soldiers or losers.

238
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:45,787
A few words to those,

239
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:49,426
who, not career officers,
share our lot

240
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:53,907
and are the majority here,
as I see scientists, teachers,

241
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,547
lawyers...
I even see a painter.

242
00:25:58,426 --> 00:25:59,907
You must endure,

243
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:04,986
because there won't be a free
Poland without you.

244
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:10,907
The aim for us, ordinary
soldiers, is to put Poland

245
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:12,907
again on the map of Europe.

246
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:17,787
Yet you'll have to make
that Poland come true in Europe.

247
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:22,946
I wish you as well as myself

248
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:26,746
to return home safe and sound.

249
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:32,506
To meet our nearest and dearest
as soon as possible.

250
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:39,627
God is born on earth,
powers tremble,

251
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:44,387
Lord bereft of
heav'nly splendor.

252
00:26:44,547 --> 00:26:50,547
Lustrous flames fade,
fires dissemble,

253
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:55,347
Infinite unending Wonder!

254
00:26:55,466 --> 00:27:00,746
Scorned yet clothed
in radiant glory,

255
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:06,186
Mortal though
He is Lord Jesus,

256
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:11,506
Thus the Word
became the flesh,

257
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:16,746
Dwelling without end
among us.

258
00:27:30,627 --> 00:27:33,307
I wonder if they'll let us go.

259
00:27:34,627 --> 00:27:37,426
You can stay here as long
as necessary.

260
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:41,226
Tadek will sure stay with
his uncle and aunt in Miechowo,

261
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:43,907
while Kazimierz is in Starobielsk...

262
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,907
I've brought a samovar.

263
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,307
This is good medicine.

264
00:27:58,186 --> 00:27:59,986
It will help.

265
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:01,867
Thank you.

266
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,226
Mrs. Anna,

267
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:20,266
come to me for
a moment, please.

268
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:24,627
Go. I'll watch over Nika.

269
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:42,506
Please.

270
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:50,307
The tea must've gotten cold.

271
00:28:56,347 --> 00:28:59,666
Unfortunately, it has.

272
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:04,226
Listen to me, Anna.

273
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:06,426
Please don't get me wrong.

274
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:09,946
I have your lot and that
of your sister at heart.

275
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:14,627
We talked about it, Captain.
That's absolutely impossible.

276
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:17,907
Yes, but the situation
has changed.

277
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:22,666
You were afraid I'd seize the
opportunity if you said yes.

278
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:25,426
Soon I'm off to
the Finnish front.

279
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:30,506
It's not the way there like they say.
I've misgivings that I won't come back.

280
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:34,506
You cannot know about that.
Nobody can.

281
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:36,226
Maybe so.

282
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:40,547
As it happens,

283
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:43,587
we know what
we cannot know.

284
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:47,746
If you marry me, then without

285
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:51,387
any consequences between us,
as I'm leaving before long.

286
00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:55,746
If I'm killed, you as the wife
of a Red Army officer

287
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:59,706
will find it easier to save
yourself and your daughter.

288
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:03,587
I have a husband.
I won't marry you.

289
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:08,666
You a wife of a Polish officer.
It spells death.

290
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:12,547
I told you
I have a husband!

291
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:17,426
- They are no more.
- What're you talking about?

292
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:23,746
I have letters from Andrzej,
who lives and will return.

293
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,226
Anna...

294
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,426
I know I don't
deserve your trust.

295
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,986
We just live
under the same roof.

296
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,746
I don't want anything for myself.

297
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:48,387
I'll tell you what
I've no right to say.

298
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:53,266
Wives of Polish
officers will go first.

299
00:30:56,867 --> 00:31:00,547
Once, I wasn't able
to save my own family,

300
00:31:02,387 --> 00:31:05,867
but I'd like to rescue
you and your daughter.

301
00:31:07,186 --> 00:31:09,186
Please trust me.

302
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:13,746
Please.

303
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:25,506
- Take two.
- Yes, sir.

304
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:27,347
Let's go quick!

305
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,426
Nika!

306
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,746
- Where's my mommy?
- Quiet, Nika.

307
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:11,186
Open up!

308
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:19,547
Elzbieta Aleksandrowna?

309
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:22,347
Born in Krakow in 1909?

310
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:26,307
The wife of the Polish Army
officer Kazimierz Ignatowicz?

311
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:28,706
Pack your things.

312
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,746
Jesus...

313
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:02,307
What happened?

314
00:33:02,426 --> 00:33:03,666
Fire?

315
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:05,946
What're you doing here?

316
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:09,587
And you?

317
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:13,746
- I report, Comrade Captain.
- I live here.

318
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:16,387
- We've come to arrest...
- Who?

319
00:33:17,986 --> 00:33:20,466
Who have you
come to arrest? Me?

320
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:22,746
No.

321
00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:25,387
Here's a warrant.

322
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:30,787
Anna Aleksandrowna,
born May, 2, 1910...

323
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,706
wife of the Polish
officer Andrzej...

324
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,347
has a daughter Weronika.

325
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,946
No such person lives here.

326
00:33:40,307 --> 00:33:43,586
- How come?
- No such person has lived here.

327
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:50,187
For over a year.
I've lived here... alone.

328
00:33:54,546 --> 00:33:57,827
- So we've come too late?
- Most likely.

329
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:00,626
Search somewhere else.

330
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:04,187
We certainly will.

331
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:12,986
Why is the girl crying?

332
00:34:13,307 --> 00:34:16,747
Don't cry! Don't you want
to see your daddy? Be quick!

333
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:19,387
You're going
to your husband.

334
00:34:57,426 --> 00:34:58,586
Niki.

335
00:35:00,187 --> 00:35:02,946
Mommy,
not a peep from me.

336
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,387
I know, dear.

337
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:08,506
I know.

338
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:19,466
- Thank you.
- You must run away.

339
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:22,387
They'll be right back.

340
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:31,466
Thank you.

341
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:46,466
The German High Command
announces:

342
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:50,946
The situation near
Narvik hasn't changed.

343
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:55,787
German planes attacked
British marching columns

344
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:59,747
with MG fire and dispersed them.

345
00:36:00,347 --> 00:36:03,187
Cracow,
Spring of 1940

346
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:06,267
A British cruiser was
hit with a bomb...

347
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:09,546
My dear God...

348
00:36:11,347 --> 00:36:12,827
You're here.

349
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,667
Are you happy, Granny,
we'll be living with you?

350
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:18,907
I am.

351
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:22,347
I'm happy...

352
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:25,387
my darling.

353
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:32,426
- Don't you have dolls, Grandma?
- Well, I didn't have a daughter.

354
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:37,387
This is your dad's teddy bear.

355
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:48,307
It was worst on the border.

356
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:52,227
I spent all my money and threw
in the ring from Andrzej to boot.

357
00:36:52,907 --> 00:36:55,267
When was the last time
he wrote you?

358
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:59,347
In March. Everything
crossed out by the censor.

359
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:04,946
I'll show you.
Bring me the bag, Nika.

360
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:10,667
Any news from Father?
They let

361
00:37:10,787 --> 00:37:13,946
- them write from Sachsenhausen?
- He writes in a way

362
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:16,667
not to provoke the censor.

363
00:37:16,787 --> 00:37:19,466
That he's fine,
they feed them well,

364
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:21,546
and he'll be back soon.

365
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:26,986
- And you don't believe it?
- No...

366
00:37:29,387 --> 00:37:30,827
Yes.

367
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:36,867
- I believe my misgivings.
- What do they tell you?

368
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:39,787
They've been
treating us too well.

369
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:42,707
Let us celebrate Xmas.
It's suspicious.

370
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,626
Don't tell anybody.

371
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:48,546
That 2nd lieutenant
tried to hang himself again.

372
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,946
The men are in bad shape.
We have to set an example.

373
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:53,227
How long?

374
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:55,747
England and France
will stand up for us.

375
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:59,187
They can't leave 20,000
officers behind the front line.

376
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:03,867
Cannons or tanks
can be rebuilt,

377
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:06,946
but a trained soldier
is irreplaceable.

378
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:10,546
I just hope it won't
cross the tovarishchi's minds.

379
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,347
Chin up, lieutenant.

380
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:15,586
You don't look well recently.

381
00:38:15,747 --> 00:38:18,347
It's my kidneys
and I get shivers.

382
00:38:20,787 --> 00:38:23,227
Here's a present for you.

383
00:38:23,347 --> 00:38:26,986
- How come? And you?
- I have another.

384
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:30,387
Mother prepared me for the war
as if it were school.

385
00:38:30,546 --> 00:38:32,986
This is her handwriting.
My name.

386
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:36,626
Thank you.
I'll return it in a few days.

387
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,946
No need.
I really have another.

388
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,267
Mom,

389
00:38:53,426 --> 00:38:56,307
Mr. Wieslaw's
brought a package for you.

390
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:58,747
- Hello, Madam.
- Hello.

391
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:00,787
It's from Germany.

392
00:39:00,946 --> 00:39:03,546
You have to sign the receipt.

393
00:39:06,946 --> 00:39:09,747
One moment. Here.

394
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:17,187
Thank you.

395
00:39:17,347 --> 00:39:21,466
- Please wait.
- Not this time, Madam.

396
00:39:21,586 --> 00:39:23,387
Please forgive me.

397
00:39:28,506 --> 00:39:29,787
Read, please.

398
00:39:39,506 --> 00:39:43,387
The Sachsenhausen camp
commander

399
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:49,466
regrets to inform you that
on March 4, 1940,

400
00:39:52,426 --> 00:39:58,586
Prof. Jan died in jail of
an untreated cardiac defect.

401
00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:52,827
- Jesus' holy name be praised.
- For ever and ever.

402
00:41:16,546 --> 00:41:18,506
- Here.
- Thank you.

403
00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:26,187
What's that list?

404
00:41:26,347 --> 00:41:28,946
The names of all
they transport away.

405
00:41:29,227 --> 00:41:32,506
I have everybody from
the 1 st transport on April 3.

406
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:37,426
Men are easy to lose, but their families
and the army are waiting for them...

407
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:42,347
- As they say, diaries don't burn.
- Buttons...

408
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:47,347
That's what will be left of us.

409
00:41:58,387 --> 00:42:00,546
I wonder where they send us?

410
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:04,787
- To neutral countries maybe.
- Where did you hear that?

411
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:09,347
We were vaccinated against typhus.
With the Soviets that means

412
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:12,307
- we're off on a long journej.
- Attention!

413
00:42:12,426 --> 00:42:14,986
I'm reading
the following names...

414
00:42:21,546 --> 00:42:24,466
They've read your name.

415
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:44,387
Your things and off.

416
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:50,747
I'm staying.

417
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:55,546
Don't worry, Jerzy.

418
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:59,307
This is not the last transport.
You'll come on the next one

419
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:01,827
and I'll get good
lodgings ready.

420
00:44:29,707 --> 00:44:35,626
Zygmunt Szymkiewicz, major doctor,
a letter from a Health Dept.

421
00:44:35,747 --> 00:44:38,867
Cracow,
April, 13, 1943

422
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:43,267
Roman Zajaczkowski land engineer
His service papers were found.

423
00:44:43,387 --> 00:44:48,546
Antoni Danda,
military rank unknown,

424
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:53,267

425
00:44:54,546 --> 00:44:58,546

426
00:44:58,707 --> 00:45:00,747
Ferdynand Marecki,

427
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:05,307
his student card
and a telegram attached.

428
00:45:05,426 --> 00:45:12,267
Edmund Baszkowski
b. In Kalisz in 1903,

429
00:45:12,387 --> 00:45:13,867
lawyer.

430
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,466
Marian Dobrowolski,

431
00:45:16,586 --> 00:45:19,506
lieutenant pilot,
engineer designer...

432
00:45:20,586 --> 00:45:24,227
- Goniec Krakowski, please.
- I got the latest. Here.

433
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:31,747
Stanislaw Jakubowicz
lieutenant, no personal details.

434
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:35,907
Wladyslaw Deszczka,
cartographer,

435
00:45:36,187 --> 00:45:40,827
b. March 2, 1892.

436
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:46,426

437
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:50,586
His weapons license

Daszkiewicz, 2nd lieut.
ID attached.

441
00:46:16,347 --> 00:46:18,867
- He isn't there?
- No.

442
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:27,426
One cannot lose
a husband and son.

443
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:30,227
Right.

444
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:35,867
My sonny.
He's not there.

445
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:43,787
But I don't understand why
he didn't hide or escape.

446
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:46,546
You told me
it was possible.

447
00:46:46,946 --> 00:46:50,986
- Why didn't you persuade him?
- You know I tried.

448
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:56,187
- Why wasn't I there?
- You wouldn't've helped.

449
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:59,867
Andrzej paid the same
duty to the uniform, as Father,

450
00:46:59,986 --> 00:47:03,626
- to the university.
- But he should've been rescued.

451
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,387
My son is necessary.

452
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:13,227
You think that
I don't know that?

453
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:15,546
That I don't feel it?

454
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:20,347
If he'd felt he was needed...
I don't know, maybe...

455
00:47:21,867 --> 00:47:25,506
He wouldn't have left you,
the child, me...

456
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:28,426
Why do you speak
as if he were no more.

457
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,986
He's not on that list!
Do you hear?

458
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:35,187
But that accursed list has
the name of that Lieutenant Jerzy

459
00:47:35,347 --> 00:47:38,946
- and the general, their commander.
- So what?

460
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:41,747
He's not there and that's that.

461
00:47:41,907 --> 00:47:44,466
If he could save himself,

462
00:47:44,586 --> 00:47:49,387
even all alone, he did because that's
what I feel. I feel that Andrzej lives.

463
00:47:49,546 --> 00:47:52,946
It can't be that something
happened to him somewhere,

464
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:56,387
which I don't know.
He is part of me.

465
00:47:56,546 --> 00:47:58,827
And no part of me has died.

466
00:48:00,626 --> 00:48:03,546
Yes, yes...

467
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:30,546
A letter has come, Mom.

468
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:35,546
Official. From the Germans.

469
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:39,986
- Propaganda Abteilung...
- What can they want from you?

470
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:53,347
In connection with
the Katyn list.

471
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:55,707
They tell relatives
to come.

472
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:00,747
Let's go.

473
00:49:13,466 --> 00:49:16,187
On behalf of our leader
Adolf Hitler,

474
00:49:16,347 --> 00:49:19,387
I'd like to express my
heart-felt condolences

475
00:49:19,546 --> 00:49:23,946
on account of the tragedy that
befell your husband, the General.

476
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:35,586
It's an unprecedented crime
committed by the Soviets

477
00:49:35,747 --> 00:49:38,667
on Polish POW's in Katyn.

478
00:49:39,946 --> 00:49:44,626
The Führer ordered to return
to you the Virtuti Militari cross.

479
00:49:45,747 --> 00:49:46,946
Thank you.

480
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:51,227
Please see the statement
and next read it.

481
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:55,546
News spread very fast
of finding...

482
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:59,667
bodies of Polish officers,
including my husband's...

483
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:01,586
The wife of the General,

484
00:50:01,747 --> 00:50:05,907
I'll pray for the Soviet
criminals to be punished...

485
00:50:07,506 --> 00:50:10,707
The conversation
will be recorded.

486
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:17,626
I take it that everything
has been written out here.

487
00:50:17,747 --> 00:50:19,986
Your questions
and my answers.

488
00:50:22,747 --> 00:50:26,227
Exactly. Read it out
loud, please.

489
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:30,347
You can start now, please.

490
00:50:34,546 --> 00:50:36,827
You can start now, please.

491
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:42,867
Read it!

492
00:50:46,787 --> 00:50:51,707
Madam, you need this
statement as much as we do.

493
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:59,466
You wouldn't like to send your
daughter letters from Auschwitz?

494
00:51:14,827 --> 00:51:16,667
Please come with me!

495
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:24,506
The daughter stays here.
Sit down!

496
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:27,946
- Don't you leave me here, Mom!
- Wait here.

497
00:51:28,227 --> 00:51:30,227
Please.

498
00:51:34,347 --> 00:51:36,946
Behind the front line
near Smolensk,

499
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:40,907
the Katyn Forest, the site
of a horrendous mass murder,

500
00:51:41,187 --> 00:51:44,546
where the butchers of Kremlin
ordered executioners

501
00:51:44,707 --> 00:51:48,307
to commit a bestial murder
on 12,000 Polish POW's,

502
00:51:48,426 --> 00:51:50,546
officers and noncoms.

503
00:51:56,387 --> 00:52:00,667
A German Medical Committee along with
a Polish forensic expert Dr. Praglowski

504
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:05,707
ascertained the typically Bolshevik
way, a shot in the back of the head.

505
00:52:05,827 --> 00:52:10,466
The exit wound is in the forehead or in
the upper part of the victim's skull.

506
00:52:22,387 --> 00:52:26,546
Father Jasinski is performing
exequies over the open mass graves.

507
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:33,387
A symbolic handful of dust from
the General-Gouvernement

508
00:52:33,546 --> 00:52:35,827
is thrown over the graves.

509
00:52:42,466 --> 00:52:46,946
All those Polish offcers were
murdered in the spring of '40.

510
00:52:47,227 --> 00:52:50,707
There are many Polish
generals among the victims.

511
00:52:50,827 --> 00:52:54,747
This bears out what fate
awaited all European nations

512
00:52:54,907 --> 00:52:57,626
from the Bolshevik
murderous plague.

513
00:52:57,747 --> 00:53:02,426
Yet with his heroic attitude, the
German soldier protects our continent.

514
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:09,347
To complete the list
of names given before

515
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:13,747
of the murdered
by the Bolsheviks...

516
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:15,347
Mom!

517
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:18,546
Mom!

518
00:53:18,707 --> 00:53:21,827
...we give you further
names of the victims:

519
00:53:22,747 --> 00:53:25,747
Wladyslaw Godziszewski,
lieutenant,

520
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:30,787
b. June 22, 1895,

521
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:33,546
high school teacher.

522
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:37,827
Lucjan Gawronski,
captain,

523
00:53:37,946 --> 00:53:42,907
Olgierd Druchowicz, major,
electrical engineer.

524
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:49,946
Cracow, Jan. 18, 1945
- The hated Nazi flag hit the

525
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:54,586
cobblestones of the Krakow marketplace.
Thousands of hands tore into pieces

526
00:53:54,747 --> 00:53:58,747
the symbol of German rule over
the ancient capital of Polish kings.

527
00:54:41,307 --> 00:54:43,187
Mom, see who's arrived?

528
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,626
Our maid Stasia.

529
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,187
How elegant you look!

530
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:54,986
Stasia...

531
00:54:57,267 --> 00:55:01,546
- So we've survived.
- Yes...

532
00:55:02,946 --> 00:55:04,546
Sit down.

533
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:08,267
We worried about you.

534
00:55:08,986 --> 00:55:10,707
Well, it was hard.

535
00:55:12,867 --> 00:55:14,667
We had to hide.

536
00:55:14,787 --> 00:55:20,747
My husband took to the forest.
He was in the People's Army.

537
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:27,466
- Could we help you?
- No, thank you.

538
00:55:27,586 --> 00:55:30,626
It's quite different now.

539
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:33,867
My husband Edek
can do a great deal now.

540
00:55:33,986 --> 00:55:36,586
Your things remained
here in the pantry,

541
00:55:36,747 --> 00:55:39,626
a whole trunk.
Ewa, fetch it please.

542
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:42,227
Madam, I'd like...

543
00:55:43,546 --> 00:55:45,707
You remember?

544
00:55:45,827 --> 00:55:48,307
I'd like to return it.

545
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:53,187
I promised to keep it
and I did.

546
00:55:56,347 --> 00:55:58,466
What have you
brought us?

547
00:56:07,267 --> 00:56:08,907
Dad's saber...

548
00:56:14,546 --> 00:56:16,827
Thank you very much.

549
00:56:24,187 --> 00:56:26,667
- So I'll be going...
- Your trunk.

550
00:56:26,787 --> 00:56:31,586
No, no, give it to the Red
Cross for the poor.

551
00:56:31,747 --> 00:56:35,546
My husband was nominated
the Starosta of Piotrkow.

552
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:37,586
So I have to go.

553
00:56:45,787 --> 00:56:48,747
I thought you decided
to stay on as a maid.

554
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:51,986
I didn't see the General's
wife throughout the whole war.

555
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:54,667
Now you are the lady.

556
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:58,187
Yes, Madam, please.

557
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:39,747
Dad!

558
00:57:41,946 --> 00:57:44,747
- Andrzej.
- Dad!

559
00:57:44,867 --> 00:57:46,667
Andrzej.

560
00:57:57,387 --> 00:58:00,626
Nika...
She's grown.

561
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:07,626
Forgive her.

562
00:58:07,747 --> 00:58:10,907
She's looking forward to
seeing Father.

563
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:14,307
I'm sorry
to have disappointed you.

564
00:58:15,907 --> 00:58:18,827
- But your face...
- You recognize me?

565
00:58:20,466 --> 00:58:23,626
You're Jerzy, a lieutenant
from my son's regiment.

566
00:58:24,347 --> 00:58:26,747
Yes, a major now, but it's me.

567
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:29,506
But they said you were dead.

568
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:36,747
I saw the name and rank

569
00:58:36,907 --> 00:58:40,466
- on the list everything...
- Yes, yes, but it's a mistake.

570
00:58:40,586 --> 00:58:42,747
I live as you see.

571
00:58:42,867 --> 00:58:44,946
Where's Andrzej?

572
00:58:46,506 --> 00:58:49,626
Do you know my son's
whereabouts?

573
00:58:51,787 --> 00:58:54,307
Unfortunately,

574
00:58:55,707 --> 00:58:57,946
I saw him
in 1940 last

575
00:58:58,227 --> 00:59:00,867
when they took him
to another camp.

576
00:59:04,747 --> 00:59:06,546
That means...

577
00:59:06,707 --> 00:59:09,626
Nobody knows,
and nothing is certain.

578
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:12,946
So many mistakes.
You live...

579
00:59:19,506 --> 00:59:21,867
Anna will be happy.

580
00:59:23,747 --> 00:59:25,867
She'll be back soon.

581
00:59:25,986 --> 00:59:30,626
I have some canned meat for you.
It can be of use...

582
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:33,426
Thank you.

583
00:59:56,227 --> 00:59:57,546
Jerzy.

584
00:59:59,907 --> 01:00:05,187
- Why, you are on the Katyn list.
- I know. I've come...

585
01:00:06,747 --> 01:00:08,546
This is for you.

586
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:09,946
Thank you.

587
01:00:13,707 --> 01:00:15,187
You live.

588
01:00:17,626 --> 01:00:19,787
Where's Andrzej?
Do you know?

589
01:00:19,946 --> 01:00:22,387
His name is not on the list.

590
01:00:22,546 --> 01:00:26,626
- I'm in place for him.
- What do you mean?

591
01:00:26,747 --> 01:00:31,347
The captain had a sweater
with my name.

592
01:00:34,586 --> 01:00:36,227
Oh, God...

593
01:00:36,347 --> 01:00:40,867
Mrs. Anna. It doesn't mean
a thing. You should have...

594
01:00:40,986 --> 01:00:42,747
Hope?

595
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:47,347
I've been living hope for five years,
so don't you tell me about it.

596
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:53,347
You've come to tell me
that my husband is dead, yes?

597
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:56,946
- You want to tell me that he's dead...
- Yes.

598
01:01:25,426 --> 01:01:27,626
He said that Andrzej is dead.

599
01:02:32,227 --> 01:02:33,787
Mrs. Greta...

600
01:02:39,546 --> 01:02:42,907
Soviets of the NKVD
are on the premises.

601
01:02:43,187 --> 01:02:45,626
Have you seen them?
Calm down.

602
01:02:46,187 --> 01:02:48,946
They'll take us away
when they find this.

603
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:51,387
They'll take us away anyway.

604
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:59,227
Hide all of this immediately.

605
01:03:07,347 --> 01:03:10,667
What are you doing here?
Do you have an order?

606
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,747
I have an appointment
with the professor.

607
01:03:15,827 --> 01:03:19,466
Sir, the man says he
has an appointment with you.

608
01:03:19,586 --> 01:03:21,787
I don't remember.

609
01:03:22,426 --> 01:03:25,506
You have a warrant, major?

610
01:03:26,946 --> 01:03:29,387
You don't remember me?

611
01:03:32,426 --> 01:03:37,546
Jerzy... How come you here?
In this uniform?

612
01:03:38,546 --> 01:03:40,867
I came too late to Anders.

613
01:03:40,986 --> 01:03:44,426
But for that, I would
be in London now.

614
01:03:46,426 --> 01:03:48,907
I'm here in private, sir.

615
01:03:49,187 --> 01:03:51,707
You know that I'm
on the Katyn list?

616
01:03:53,347 --> 01:03:56,946
Forgive me, but I don't
know the list by heart.

617
01:04:02,466 --> 01:04:05,586
Things with my name
were my commander's.

618
01:04:05,747 --> 01:04:08,187
That's why I've come here.

619
01:04:08,347 --> 01:04:10,307
I think that his family

620
01:04:10,426 --> 01:04:13,747
would like to get them
before you pack them.

621
01:04:18,307 --> 01:04:21,227
Have you found
an envelope with my name?

622
01:04:21,426 --> 01:04:23,307
I don't remember.

623
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:27,747
How many names of your former
students could you have found here?

624
01:04:31,946 --> 01:04:34,267
Dozens, sir.

625
01:04:42,307 --> 01:04:43,946
This is...

626
01:04:45,347 --> 01:04:48,307
the address of the captain's wife.

627
01:04:50,227 --> 01:04:52,626
If you could find anything...

628
01:04:53,946 --> 01:04:56,307
I know you don't trust me.

629
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:59,387
But it's not the point
that I've survived,

630
01:04:59,546 --> 01:05:04,227
am in the new service,
in a new Poland, but you aren't.

631
01:05:04,347 --> 01:05:06,986
That's not the point.

632
01:05:08,626 --> 01:05:13,946
To you, this is just evidence,
but to her it may be relics.

633
01:05:15,426 --> 01:05:16,546
Aha.

634
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:05,787
On the strength of the decision
of the Extraordinary State Committee

635
01:06:05,946 --> 01:06:09,546
concerning the investigation
of the murder committed

636
01:06:09,707 --> 01:06:13,747
by the German invaders,
a special commission was appointed

637
01:06:13,907 --> 01:06:17,827
to ascertain the circumstances
of the crime committed on Polish

638
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:20,546
officer POW's in the Katyn Forest.

639
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:25,466
Each body underwent
detailed autopsy.

640
01:06:37,707 --> 01:06:39,986
A shot in the back of the head,

641
01:06:40,307 --> 01:06:43,626
the favorite way of killing
of Gestapo murderers.

642
01:06:45,986 --> 01:06:49,986
Judging by autopsies, brains,
and clothes, we can determine

643
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:53,586
that the Polish POW's
were murdered not

644
01:06:53,747 --> 01:06:56,946
earlier than in the fall of 1941.

645
01:06:58,227 --> 01:07:02,827
The Germans committed
the murder with utter cynicism,

646
01:07:02,946 --> 01:07:06,426
which the bullet
wounds bear out.

647
01:07:06,546 --> 01:07:09,867
That's how they shot the Poles.

648
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:14,867
Delegations of the 1 st
Polish Corps in the USSR

649
01:07:15,267 --> 01:07:18,227
have come for the exequies.

650
01:07:18,347 --> 01:07:19,946
HONOR TO THE FALLEN

651
01:07:21,946 --> 01:07:25,867
During the ceremony,
the priest told the participants:

652
01:07:25,986 --> 01:07:29,466
"May the shed Polish
blood be a foundation

653
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:33,747
of our revived free homeland."

654
01:07:55,827 --> 01:07:58,386
- What's the matter?
- It's a lie.

655
01:07:59,787 --> 01:08:01,946
It's a lie. Do you hear?

656
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:07,547
Please come with me.

657
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,346
It's a lie.

658
01:08:10,627 --> 01:08:11,986
Madam...

659
01:08:14,946 --> 01:08:16,867
Where do you know me?

660
01:08:16,986 --> 01:08:21,306
I received a commission
from the General before the war.

661
01:08:35,306 --> 01:08:37,707
I was there a year ago.

662
01:08:37,827 --> 01:08:39,306
Where?

663
01:08:39,427 --> 01:08:44,346
In Katyn when the Soviets
sent us to the graves.

664
01:08:44,507 --> 01:08:46,627
What were you doing
there?

665
01:08:49,346 --> 01:08:52,946
Stalin needed us, officers
of the 1 st Corps, to testify

666
01:08:53,226 --> 01:08:56,306
about the impartiality
of their investigation.

667
01:08:56,427 --> 01:08:59,667
- And?
- We did.

668
01:09:04,986 --> 01:09:08,946
It's a lie.
And you know it.

669
01:09:09,226 --> 01:09:11,867
- They had eye-witnesses.
- Major...

670
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:15,986
The Soviets must lie to cover up
the crime, but you don't have to.

671
01:09:16,306 --> 01:09:18,306
You mustn't.

672
01:09:19,507 --> 01:09:20,787
I saw them...

673
01:09:20,946 --> 01:09:24,346
pull out of the pits
those I was with in Kozielsk.

674
01:09:24,587 --> 01:09:27,707
I watched in disbelief
that I lived,

675
01:09:27,827 --> 01:09:30,986
whereas I should've
been there with them.

676
01:09:31,306 --> 01:09:36,946
You should... major...
testify about the truth.

677
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:40,386
I could just as well
shoot myself in the head.

678
01:09:54,386 --> 01:09:57,547
You salute murderers
as if they were victors.

679
01:09:57,667 --> 01:10:00,787
Makes no difference
whether Soviets or Germans.

680
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,747
Nobody will resurrect
the dead anyway.

681
01:10:04,907 --> 01:10:08,467
We have to survive, forgive.

682
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,346
We must live.

683
01:10:13,346 --> 01:10:15,346
You're the same as they.

684
01:10:17,427 --> 01:10:21,547
You may think differently,
but you do the same.

685
01:10:21,707 --> 01:10:25,627
What does it matter
that you think differently?

686
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:39,547
The Katyn graves opened up

687
01:10:39,707 --> 01:10:44,306
for the third time
to reveal to the world

688
01:10:44,427 --> 01:10:46,787
the terrifying truth

689
01:10:46,946 --> 01:10:51,707
about still another
German murder

690
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:56,346
committed on the Polish nation.

691
01:10:59,587 --> 01:11:04,547
- Will you drink?
- Miss Krysia, pour one for the major.

692
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:09,587
- I'm cold after the service.
- They premiere a Soviet film in town.

693
01:11:09,747 --> 01:11:12,667
- What?
- Haven't you heard?

694
01:11:12,787 --> 01:11:16,747
A dozen thousand of our officers
were murdered in Katyn.

695
01:11:16,867 --> 01:11:21,667
- What're you talking about?
- To the victory over those criminals.

696
01:11:21,787 --> 01:11:23,547
Jerzy!

697
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:28,547
- What're you talking about, dammit?
- About the historical truth.

698
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:30,266
Miss Krysia,

699
01:11:31,986 --> 01:11:33,787
vodka for everyone.

700
01:11:33,946 --> 01:11:36,386
The whole world didn't know...

701
01:11:36,547 --> 01:11:39,507
what to think about
that crime.

702
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:44,787
There were horrible
rumors that

703
01:11:45,867 --> 01:11:48,467
no one knew who and how...

704
01:11:49,507 --> 01:11:51,946
- But it's plain that...
- Stop it!

705
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:54,747
...it was the Germans in '41

706
01:11:54,907 --> 01:11:57,907
murdered everyone shooting
in the back of the head.

707
01:11:58,186 --> 01:12:01,827
Piss off. You're drunk.

708
01:12:01,946 --> 01:12:04,266
- Miss Krysia.
- Don't pay.

709
01:12:07,427 --> 01:12:09,946
I want to pay
in memory of them.

710
01:12:14,547 --> 01:12:16,827
Get out of here.
You're drunk.

711
01:12:17,587 --> 01:12:20,907
Look, the people can be silenced.

712
01:12:21,346 --> 01:12:24,306
You don't know
what you're talking about.

713
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:26,346
That's why I'm talking!

714
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:29,747
You fool.

715
01:12:54,627 --> 01:12:58,986
I don't know what I'm saying?
You all know the same.

716
01:13:00,266 --> 01:13:01,667
All.

717
01:13:02,547 --> 01:13:06,587
And you, and you,
and you.

718
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:08,747
Get out of here!

719
01:13:13,427 --> 01:13:15,986
The Katyn Forest blood

720
01:13:16,306 --> 01:13:20,547
is calling to us out loud...

721
01:13:20,707 --> 01:13:25,226
calling us to take a merciless...

722
01:13:25,346 --> 01:13:27,507
revenge...

723
01:13:28,386 --> 01:13:30,547
Not for a moment are we

724
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:33,627
allowed to forget

725
01:13:34,346 --> 01:13:37,946
about the terrible
death of our brothers...

726
01:13:39,827 --> 01:13:41,946
who were later dumped

727
01:13:42,266 --> 01:13:44,707
into a common pit...

728
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:49,306
and next dragged out of the pit...

729
01:13:52,346 --> 01:13:56,627
those jackals and hyenas.

730
01:13:57,827 --> 01:14:01,627
POW's were murdered

731
01:14:01,747 --> 01:14:04,787
in cold blood

732
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:08,747
calmly, systematically.

733
01:14:10,787 --> 01:14:14,186
Dumped into a common pit,

734
01:14:14,346 --> 01:14:19,946
professional officers,
engineers, doctors...

735
01:14:22,747 --> 01:14:25,547
- What's your name?
- Lieutenant Klin.

736
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:28,827
You'll be a witness.
Take him. Quick!

737
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:42,306
Over 10,000 of Polish
intelligentsia,

738
01:14:42,427 --> 01:14:47,346
whom the war dressed
in military uniforms.

739
01:15:01,346 --> 01:15:05,346
Agnieszka, I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

740
01:15:09,507 --> 01:15:13,427
News from the rising raised
doubts if anyone had survived.

741
01:15:14,226 --> 01:15:16,306
I lucked up.

742
01:15:16,427 --> 01:15:18,186
Thank God.

743
01:15:18,827 --> 01:15:21,747
My sister said
you were looking for me.

744
01:15:22,587 --> 01:15:25,667
I asked her to get in touch,
but she never came.

745
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:29,907
Nothing will change her
and she won't return to church.

746
01:15:30,186 --> 01:15:33,747
You'll be disappointed in me.
I haven't come to pray.

747
01:15:35,547 --> 01:15:37,346
I was there.

748
01:15:38,226 --> 01:15:39,787
There?

749
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:44,547
Over the Katyn graves

750
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:48,667
in 1943.

751
01:15:52,467 --> 01:15:57,747
In my presence, this rosary was
pried out of your brother's hand.

752
01:16:07,266 --> 01:16:12,547
You recognized him?
How?

753
01:16:15,427 --> 01:16:18,547
By his service papers.

754
01:16:53,946 --> 01:16:56,747
I didn't want him
to look so serious.

755
01:17:00,507 --> 01:17:03,667
It was snapped when
he was appointed lieutenant.

756
01:17:06,467 --> 01:17:08,946
He wasn't a professional officer,

757
01:17:09,226 --> 01:17:13,266
but an engineer designer,
building a new sports plane.

758
01:17:13,386 --> 01:17:15,867
He looks so glum,

759
01:17:15,986 --> 01:17:19,547
rather than happy
as he usually was.

760
01:17:19,707 --> 01:17:22,827
- May I?
- A pity I didn't have another photo.

761
01:17:22,946 --> 01:17:26,266
I'll try to make
him look smiling.

762
01:17:26,386 --> 01:17:29,306
But it's a very beautiful photo.
I wanted to ask

763
01:17:29,427 --> 01:17:31,627
you if I could make a copy.

764
01:17:33,547 --> 01:17:35,266
Yes?

765
01:17:36,346 --> 01:17:38,707
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

766
01:17:38,827 --> 01:17:41,627
It didn't bring us luck.

767
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:45,587
It'll be ready tomorrow.

768
01:18:01,747 --> 01:18:04,707
Please come tomorrow.
Excuse me.

769
01:18:15,467 --> 01:18:16,587
Tadzio?

770
01:18:18,747 --> 01:18:19,747
Aunt.

771
01:18:21,306 --> 01:18:23,747
- Tadzio.
- Aunt Anna.

772
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:25,747
- Tadzio.
- Hello, Aunt.

773
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,467
God! What're you
doing here?

774
01:18:28,587 --> 01:18:31,386
You've grown so tall
that I hardly recognize you.

775
01:18:32,986 --> 01:18:35,467
And Ela?
Any news about mom?

776
01:18:35,587 --> 01:18:38,346
None since they took her away.
I thought you...

777
01:18:38,507 --> 01:18:42,547
No. No answer to so many
letters I sent.

778
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:44,627
You know about Father.

779
01:18:44,747 --> 01:18:46,707
He's on the list.

780
01:18:46,827 --> 01:18:49,627
Everything tallies:
The number, rank...

781
01:18:51,547 --> 01:18:53,547
- Good bye...
- Good bye.

782
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:56,787
Where have you been?
With the aunt and uncle?

783
01:18:56,946 --> 01:19:00,226
After they took Mom with Halinka,
I stayed with the uncle.

784
01:19:00,346 --> 01:19:02,946
- There was nothing to return to.
- I worked in

785
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:06,547
a factory. When I turned 18
in the Kielce Province then.

786
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:09,587
- In Kielce or in the country?
- Neither.

787
01:19:11,986 --> 01:19:13,627
Tadzio...

788
01:19:28,867 --> 01:19:30,346
Thank you.

789
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:49,867
Come...

790
01:19:51,547 --> 01:19:52,946
Come, Tadzio.

791
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:58,787
Mr. Wladyslaw, my nephew
has come to have his pictrue

792
01:19:58,946 --> 01:20:00,707
- taken.
- Yes, sir.

793
01:20:01,787 --> 01:20:03,827
What size photo?

794
01:20:03,946 --> 01:20:06,346
A passport photo.

795
01:20:06,507 --> 01:20:09,747
I read in the paper that
the Fine Arts Academy

796
01:20:09,867 --> 01:20:12,827
is going to be opened.
If I start a new life...

797
01:20:12,946 --> 01:20:14,587
Wonderful.

798
01:20:15,747 --> 01:20:20,226
I like to draw.
Take a look, Aunt.

799
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:33,306
Mrs. Anna we again have
college students in Poland.

800
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:35,747
Exactly! And how clever.

801
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:38,226
Please follow me.

802
01:20:56,747 --> 01:20:58,707
To the left.

803
01:20:59,306 --> 01:21:02,266
My left, your right.

804
01:21:20,467 --> 01:21:23,427
In high school,
students don't smoke, sir.

805
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:25,986
Sorry.

806
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:31,587
- You fought in the forest?
- Yes, but there's an amnesty.

807
01:21:32,827 --> 01:21:35,627
I see that you
attended secret classes.

808
01:21:36,627 --> 01:21:40,667
You should get credits
for the senior year

809
01:21:40,787 --> 01:21:44,226
and try to get a high school
diploma after intensive courses.

810
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:46,667
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wonderful!

811
01:21:48,827 --> 01:21:51,627
Anything else?
Why are you staring at me?

812
01:21:51,747 --> 01:21:55,386
- Because I've seen you.
- Where?

813
01:21:55,547 --> 01:21:58,226
In a photo in
a photographic studio.

814
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,747
Along with
a couple under a plane.

815
01:22:00,907 --> 01:22:04,547
- He was in a pilot's uniform.
- Which studio?

816
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:08,427
- Near the marketplace?
- Yes.

817
01:22:08,547 --> 01:22:10,907
- Madam...
- Yes?

818
01:22:11,186 --> 01:22:12,747
Come here for a moment.

819
01:22:12,907 --> 01:22:14,547
Good bye.

820
01:22:15,946 --> 01:22:18,186
Wait a minute.

821
01:22:18,427 --> 01:22:20,907
We have a problem here.

822
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:23,627
- What?
- Your father.

823
01:22:23,747 --> 01:22:25,747
What about him?

824
01:22:26,266 --> 01:22:28,507
What did you write here?

825
01:22:32,306 --> 01:22:36,346
Something not clear? The Soviets
murdered him in Katyn in 1940.

826
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:51,867
- I must lie about my father?
- Be reasonable.

827
01:22:51,986 --> 01:22:54,867
- In the forest...
- You're not in the forest.

828
01:22:54,986 --> 01:22:59,747
- Your opponents are not Germans.
- This is treason, Madam.

829
01:22:59,867 --> 01:23:04,507
I only care for you to get the diploma.
This country must be raised from ruins.

830
01:23:04,627 --> 01:23:07,946
Who'll do it if you all
let yourselves get killed.

831
01:23:09,627 --> 01:23:13,547
You'll make corrections
in your CV, yes?

832
01:23:20,946 --> 01:23:23,907
One have only one CV, Madam.

833
01:23:27,547 --> 01:23:29,707
What do we do about him?

834
01:23:29,827 --> 01:23:34,467
Your attitude to Katyn bespeaks
your loyalty to People's Poland.

835
01:23:36,346 --> 01:23:38,827
I admit him and
you see to it

836
01:23:38,946 --> 01:23:42,427
that he be reasonable.

837
01:23:42,547 --> 01:23:45,827
You're his home
room teacher, right?

838
01:23:47,266 --> 01:23:52,547
- What if Poland becomes free?
- There will never be a free Poland.

839
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:54,787
Mark my words.

840
01:23:56,747 --> 01:23:58,186
Never.

841
01:24:23,946 --> 01:24:27,266
I don't know Cracow.
Where do I run away?

842
01:24:45,707 --> 01:24:49,226
- Have you seen a boy in a brown coat?
- No, no, no.

843
01:25:20,867 --> 01:25:25,346
- You've saved me.
- Why did you do it?

844
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:28,946
Do I sit meek when they spit in my face?
I fuck such an order.

845
01:25:29,266 --> 01:25:30,747
Sorry.

846
01:25:30,907 --> 01:25:33,827
- "Aurochs".
- Ewa.

847
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:16,386
The coast is clear.

848
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:23,266
- Will we meet again?
- I don't know.

849
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:26,547
But we will for sure.
It's destiny.

850
01:26:26,667 --> 01:26:32,306
Maybe... if you think so.
Yes, we'll meet.

851
01:26:32,427 --> 01:26:34,907
That's not what I think.
I want it.

852
01:26:36,346 --> 01:26:37,787
So do I.

853
01:26:39,386 --> 01:26:41,346
The world's laughing.

854
01:26:41,986 --> 01:26:43,787
THE WORLD'S LAUGHING

855
01:26:44,747 --> 01:26:48,547
- I've never been to the movies.
- No kidding.

856
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:52,747
Haven't you seen that Disney's
The Sleeping Beauty, remember?

857
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:55,186
But that doesn't count.

858
01:26:55,346 --> 01:26:58,266
I've never sat with a girl
on the rooftop.

859
01:26:58,386 --> 01:27:01,467
Tomorrow in the movie house?

860
01:27:01,587 --> 01:27:02,547
At 6 pm?

861
01:27:03,507 --> 01:27:04,787
Good.

862
01:27:36,226 --> 01:27:38,587
Freeze or I'll shoot!

863
01:28:46,346 --> 01:28:47,827
Are you sure?

864
01:28:49,226 --> 01:28:51,946
We'll plait a braid first.

865
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:56,747
You are saving my role.

866
01:28:57,667 --> 01:29:00,306
No character without hair, right?

867
01:29:00,427 --> 01:29:03,986
Those Germans who worked
at the theater during the occupation

868
01:29:04,306 --> 01:29:07,827
took all the wigs away,
didn't leave anything.

869
01:29:07,946 --> 01:29:12,707
- We'll plait a thick braid.
- What if I let the hair down?

870
01:29:14,346 --> 01:29:18,266
It won't grow after the camp.
It was Auschwitz, you see?

871
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:25,427
It's a pity to cut it off.
Does your husband know?

872
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:27,427
Do your duty.

873
01:29:30,547 --> 01:29:32,747
Don't you worry.
He'll return.

874
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:37,507
Yesterday a technical help
from our theater returned.

875
01:29:37,627 --> 01:29:39,946
All of us had bewailed him.

876
01:29:46,867 --> 01:29:50,787
Why live with
so much evil around?

877
01:29:51,747 --> 01:29:53,707
Lt'd be a true misfortune

878
01:29:53,827 --> 01:29:57,547
if my brother were left
without a grave after his death.

879
01:29:57,946 --> 01:29:59,946
And the rest.

880
01:30:00,266 --> 01:30:02,186
It's indifferent to me.

881
01:30:05,787 --> 01:30:07,946
Do you think I'm mad?

882
01:30:08,226 --> 01:30:11,867
How to judge a mad woman...

883
01:30:11,986 --> 01:30:15,627
...before the tribunal
of a madman?

884
01:30:17,346 --> 01:30:22,827
Who puts on a wig of someone's
hair, assumes his lot.

885
01:30:24,427 --> 01:30:27,226
I wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy.

886
01:30:55,306 --> 01:30:58,226
- Count it.
- Would you like to see it?

887
01:31:01,946 --> 01:31:04,266
LIEUTENANT PILOT

888
01:31:18,346 --> 01:31:20,667
You're looking for someone?

889
01:31:20,787 --> 01:31:23,467
I have an appointment
with the Canon.

890
01:31:23,587 --> 01:31:25,946
- The Canon is not here.
- So I'll wait.

891
01:31:28,907 --> 01:31:31,827
But he was taken away
last night.

892
01:31:33,747 --> 01:31:36,386
- Last night?
- Last night.

893
01:31:37,547 --> 01:31:42,226
When the Germans dug out
the graves in Katyn in 1943,

894
01:31:42,346 --> 01:31:45,946
the Canon said Mass there?
Those from the International

895
01:31:46,226 --> 01:31:49,547
Red Cross who were there,
the NKVD arrested long ago.

896
01:31:49,667 --> 01:31:52,627
But I've brought a plaque
of my brother.

897
01:31:52,747 --> 01:31:55,907
- Did the Canon agree?
- Yes.

898
01:32:02,587 --> 01:32:04,186
Lieutenant Pilot

899
01:32:05,787 --> 01:32:09,427
killed in Katyn in April 1940.

900
01:32:11,747 --> 01:32:14,507
But I cannot
put it up in the church.

901
01:32:14,627 --> 01:32:18,747
I thought temples differed from
government offices or papers.

902
01:32:21,707 --> 01:32:25,507
Those who took the Canon
away said they knew

903
01:32:25,627 --> 01:32:29,427
all enemies of the people's
power, including the Lord God.

904
01:32:29,587 --> 01:32:33,986
The Soviets did it in '40.
Everyone knows about it.

905
01:32:34,306 --> 01:32:37,667
- You must agree.
- Did you think about the living?

906
01:32:37,787 --> 01:32:41,266
How this plaque may
change the lot of the Canon?

907
01:32:48,386 --> 01:32:50,667
Take it away.

908
01:33:20,986 --> 01:33:22,946
What do you want to do?

909
01:33:23,266 --> 01:33:27,226
To put it on our tomb
before it can hang in the church.

910
01:33:31,226 --> 01:33:34,587
- Where have you been so long?
- What would you like to know?

911
01:33:34,747 --> 01:33:38,226
- You could sometimes drop a line.
- Have you forgotten that...

912
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:41,827
- we had a brother?
- No, I haven't.

913
01:33:43,226 --> 01:33:44,946
So help me.

914
01:33:47,827 --> 01:33:50,946
- You're afraid.
- You know I can't.

915
01:33:51,266 --> 01:33:53,386
Join the Party.
That gives power.

916
01:33:54,427 --> 01:33:58,787
It's not that way. It's a different
time and no one will free

917
01:33:58,946 --> 01:34:02,667
us from it neither during
our life or that of our children.

918
01:34:02,787 --> 01:34:04,667
You've joined already.

919
01:34:07,747 --> 01:34:10,467
Even the Rising
taught you nothing.

920
01:34:10,587 --> 01:34:15,747
You won't change this world.
We can let them deport or kill us.

921
01:34:15,867 --> 01:34:20,346
Or build as much freedom
as we can here,

922
01:34:20,507 --> 01:34:22,986
as much Polish identity
as we can.

923
01:34:23,306 --> 01:34:25,907
You're too wise
not to understand that.

924
01:34:26,186 --> 01:34:29,186
You've found a place in
this new world of yours,

925
01:34:29,346 --> 01:34:32,827
whereas I am whole
in that where Piotr is.

926
01:34:32,946 --> 01:34:36,747
If I must choose,
I stay with him.

927
01:34:37,306 --> 01:34:39,827
You choose the dead,
which is morbid.

928
01:34:39,946 --> 01:34:44,346
No. I choose the murdered,
not the murderers.

929
01:35:01,306 --> 01:35:03,306
How long will it take?

930
01:35:03,427 --> 01:35:06,747
The work - 20 minutes,
but later even less.

931
01:35:08,346 --> 01:35:09,946
I don't understand.

932
01:35:10,266 --> 01:35:12,386
You asked how long
it would take.

933
01:35:31,867 --> 01:35:33,667
Do your work.

934
01:35:52,867 --> 01:35:57,667
I hear that you spread
false information about Katyn.

935
01:35:57,787 --> 01:36:00,266
What do you think is false?

936
01:36:00,747 --> 01:36:03,787
My brother's letter from

937
01:36:03,946 --> 01:36:06,547
April 6, 1940 is true.

938
01:36:06,667 --> 01:36:09,306
You know it was the Germans.

939
01:36:10,907 --> 01:36:14,507
You put a plaque in the cemetery

940
01:36:14,627 --> 01:36:17,587
with a false date of your
brother's death in 1940.

941
01:36:17,747 --> 01:36:21,946
- To slander the Soviet comrades?
- I'm interested in the truth.

942
01:36:22,226 --> 01:36:24,547
The truth is a given.

943
01:36:24,667 --> 01:36:27,627
The Russians persuade
all it was the Germans.

944
01:36:27,747 --> 01:36:30,787
The Germans accuse the Russians.
Even the Polish

945
01:36:30,946 --> 01:36:34,547
- government did not explain the affair.
- Hands on the table!

946
01:36:34,986 --> 01:36:39,467
How can you say I spread
false information about Katyn?

947
01:36:39,587 --> 01:36:43,827
You'll sign a statement that
Katyn is a German crime.

948
01:36:45,907 --> 01:36:47,186
No.

949
01:36:49,747 --> 01:36:55,707
Who did you fight in the Rising?
Saved by a miracle,

950
01:36:55,827 --> 01:36:58,787
you don't want to live
in your own country?

951
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:02,667
- You're in your own country.
- You find life unbearable?

952
01:37:03,266 --> 01:37:08,386
Major, the Germans tried that
with me for 5 years,

953
01:37:09,427 --> 01:37:12,226
and you in 5 minutes?

954
01:37:12,707 --> 01:37:15,627
We have much more time
than the Germans.

955
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:21,507
Maybe so.
Just tell me where I am.

956
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,266
In Poland?

957
01:37:23,707 --> 01:37:25,386
Take her away.

958
01:38:30,346 --> 01:38:32,467
Nika!

959
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:37,946
- Father's coming.
- No. You're again imagining things.

960
01:38:43,226 --> 01:38:44,707
Yes?

961
01:38:44,986 --> 01:38:47,266
- This is for you.
- Yes?

962
01:38:47,386 --> 01:38:51,827
We don't return mementos
from Katyn to the families now.

963
01:38:51,946 --> 01:38:54,747
- When I learned that the major...
- What major?

964
01:38:54,867 --> 01:38:58,427
The one who asked
to give it to you shot himself.

965
01:38:58,547 --> 01:39:01,627
He shot himself.
So I decided to bring it.

966
01:39:19,186 --> 01:39:23,306
Kozielsk, April 7, '40.

967
01:39:23,427 --> 01:39:26,346
For two days they've
been deporting us.

968
01:39:26,507 --> 01:39:28,946
Where and why?
Nobody knows.

969
01:39:30,827 --> 01:39:33,787
After a search at 4:55 p.m.

970
01:39:33,946 --> 01:39:36,667
Our Polish time 2:55 p.m.

971
01:39:36,787 --> 01:39:40,346
We left the walls and barbed wires
of the Kozielsk camp.

972
01:39:40,467 --> 01:39:44,587
We were put in prison carriages.
I'd never seen such carriages.

973
01:39:44,747 --> 01:39:49,667
They say that 50% of passenger
cars in the USSR are prison ones.

974
01:40:09,226 --> 01:40:12,986
8:30 a.m. Departure from
Kozielsk westward.

975
01:40:13,587 --> 01:40:16,386
9:45 a.m. Jelnia Station.

976
01:40:16,946 --> 01:40:20,907
I'm along with a major,
a colonel, and a few captains.

977
01:40:21,186 --> 01:40:24,827
Twelve altogether
with room for seven at the most.

978
01:40:24,946 --> 01:40:27,907
Judging by the pieces
of paper we found,

979
01:40:28,186 --> 01:40:31,986
we get off outside Smolensk
about 10 km. We'll see.

980
01:40:37,306 --> 01:40:39,547
We must be going to Smolensk.

981
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:43,266
Gniezdovo Station.

982
01:41:05,907 --> 01:41:07,707
Lieutenant Pilot,

983
01:41:09,986 --> 01:41:11,946
1 st Air Squadron, Deblin.

984
01:41:14,907 --> 01:41:19,946
April 10, 1940.

985
01:41:59,907 --> 01:42:03,507
4:45 a.m. They wake us up
in the prison cars.

986
01:42:03,627 --> 01:42:06,587
Now by trucks...

987
01:42:22,747 --> 01:42:26,346
Arrival at Gniezdovo, :
402 km away from Moscow.

988
01:42:27,467 --> 01:42:30,386
Two Black Marias and
a truck for things.

989
01:44:00,467 --> 01:44:02,587
Take off your belt.

990
01:44:21,707 --> 01:44:23,346
Next.

991
01:44:30,946 --> 01:44:34,747
Family name, patronymic, rank.

992
01:44:34,907 --> 01:44:37,547
The general's documents.

993
01:44:38,707 --> 01:44:43,427
Born April 2, 1892.

994
01:44:43,747 --> 01:44:45,346
It checks out.

995
01:44:47,547 --> 01:44:49,747
Take him away.

996
01:44:53,946 --> 01:44:56,226
Next.

997
01:47:02,986 --> 01:47:08,946
5:00 a.m. We leave
in a Black Maria.

998
01:47:09,266 --> 01:47:14,186
They brought us to a forest,
a kind of spa. A thorough search.

999
01:47:14,346 --> 01:47:16,946
They didn't find
my wedding ring.

1000
01:47:17,266 --> 01:47:21,226
They took away my belt,
penknife, and watch.

1001
01:47:21,346 --> 01:47:25,946
It showed 8:30 a.m.,
our Polish time 6:30 a.m.

1002
01:47:27,306 --> 01:47:29,226
What will happen to us?

1003
01:48:28,306 --> 01:48:30,667
Our Father
Thou art in heaven...

1004
01:49:10,266 --> 01:49:13,427
Thy will be done on Earth
as well as in Heaven.

1005
01:49:35,507 --> 01:49:37,946
Give us this day our daily bread...

1006
01:50:07,346 --> 01:50:09,747
...Forgive us our trespasses...

1007
01:50:20,707 --> 01:50:23,946
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us...
