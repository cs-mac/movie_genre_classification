1
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,814
It's a beautiful day.

2
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,956
It's a beautiful day.

3
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,189
It's God's good day.
It's a beautiful day.

4
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:24,461
You know, standing up for God,
it's not an easy thing.

5
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,003
Nobody said it was easy.
It is not easy.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,131
But Jesus, Jesus saved my life.

7
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,303
He saved my life.

8
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,141
I relate it to David,
the psalmist, who said:

9
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,874
Thou hast picked me up
from the dunghill

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,849
and placed my feet
on a solid rock.

11
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,682
And Jesus,

12
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:46,984
Jesus, he lifted me up
from a horrible pit as well,

13
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,594
and he washed my heart clean,
and he cleaned me up

14
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:54,494
from all my sins
and all the evil that I did.

15
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,829
I'm all cleaned up,
and it's a wonderful feeling.

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,699
It is wonderful.

17
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,172
And he gave me this message.
He gave me this message to give to you today.

18
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,571
And today, he says:

19
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,010
Go, ye, unto all the world
and spread the gospel,

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,550
for he who believes
and is baptized will be saved.

21
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,915
Amen. Amen.

Oh, please,
you're a lot of help.

56
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,717
I was hoping for a little help
myself. I got this problem, lady.

57
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,862
Oh, yeah? Somehow your
problems become my problems.

58
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,721
Shoo. I got a runt in the oven.
I've got work to do.

59
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:08,958
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

60
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,362
- Me too.
- Ha, ha.

61
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,731
- Mm. That tickle?
- Stop it, don't tickle there.

62
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,074
- I told you don't do that.
- Careful, honey. Careful, honey.

Careful, honey.

Ooh. Ooh, ooh.
Ha-ha-ha.

Hop on there, squirt.
There you go.

66
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,313
And get that other one. There you go.
Now, arms real straight.

67
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:32,150
Now, pick her up
and walk. Look at that.

68
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,225
Oh, boy. I got you.

69
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,220
- You're like a gigantic monster girl.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,663
Going into town to
cause damage. Ha, ha.

71
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,858
Big trouble.

72
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,740
Hello.

73
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,347
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Let me introduce myself.

74
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,212
Name's Bobbie Lee Moore,
Syracuse Accordion Company.

75
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,515
I'd like to show you an instrument to
bring magic into your little one's life.

76
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,885
How'd you like
to play the squeezebox?

77
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,524
This here is the Titano
Palmer-Hughes Grand.

78
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,187
It has all the features
of a full-size accordion.

79
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,266
Forty-one full-length black
and mother-of-pearl keys,

80
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,528
all your sharps,
all your flats.

81
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,771
Now it's your turn.

82
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,969
I'm sorry, but
she's not really musical.

83
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,274
I wouldn't wanna
waste your time.

84
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,281
Not to contradict you, but maybe
she hasn't found her instrument.

85
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,801
Wow. Look at the way
you squeeze that box.

86
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,844
What do you think of
the Titano Palmer-Hughes Grand?

87
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,809
It's practically
bigger than she is.

88
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,951
She can barely
stand up straight.

89
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,344
Okay.

90
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,418
Mama.

91
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:25,593
- Oh, darling.
- I love you. I love you.

92
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,831
Everything is going
to be all right.

93
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,975
We'll see you in church
on Sunday?

94
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,082
Yes, ma'am.

95
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,853
Oh, it's hot today
here in Vacation Bible School.

96
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:26,156
Just nod your head
if you're hot today. Yes?

97
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,495
Do you know the Lamb of God?
Do you know that he is knocking

98
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,360
at the door of your heart?

99
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,664
So gentle the way he does it.

100
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:38,708
Just... so soft.

101
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,038
Gently. Tap, tap, tap.

102
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,236
Can you hear it?

103
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,441
Can you hear him there?
Jesus is a gentleman, children.

104
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:52,181
He's not gonna come barging into
your heart without an invitation.

105
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,020
Won't you open the door
for Jesus?

106
00:06:56,383 --> 00:07:00,024
Want you to take
that chain off your door

107
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,030
and lift up that latch

108
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,395
and open that up.

109
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,898
Who's there? It's Jesus.

110
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,563
And he's waiting for you, children.

111
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,731
You're welcome here, dear Lord.

112
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,246
All right, let us
bow our heads and pray.

113
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,874
With everyone's eyes closed now,
no one looking around,

114
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,543
raise your hand
if you made a decision today.

115
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,246
Yes, Pastor Bud,

116
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:29,622
I opened the door.
I didn't leave Jesus out in the cold.

117
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,163
I wanna go to heaven.

118
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,555
No pig snorting, please.

119
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,101
Little children, this is the time
now to make the decision.

120
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,732
I see you. Does anyone else
think this is the...?

121
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,405
I see you, dear.

122
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,445
Is there anybody else today
who will raise your hand and say:

123
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,411
"This is my day."

124
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,916
To say, "I've been saved."

125
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,744
I see you, dear child.

126
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,757
I see you, sweetheart.
I see you, I see you.

127
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:04,259
Tim, Corinne, Shelly.
I'll speak to you up here.

128
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,619
Everyone else, as you head out,

129
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,266
do be careful on those steps.
Won't you?

130
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,197
Happy summer.

131
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,207
Now,

132
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,676
I want you to know

133
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,613
what a great day it is
in heaven right now.

134
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,156
Do you know why?

135
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,453
Because we asked Jesus
into our heart?

136
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,122
Hearts, moron.

137
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,360
Because you made
the best decision of your lives.

138
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,399
Put your hands together.

139
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,629
You've made the best
decision of your lives.

140
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,536
Don't be ashamed
of Jesus, children,

141
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,810
and he won't be ashamed of you.

142
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,311
I want you to tell your mama
and your papa

143
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,643
that your names have
been written in the book of life.

144
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,712
Oh, Kathleen, Kathleen.

145
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,050
All right.
Is it hot enough for you?

146
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,988
I might join my girls
at the pool this afternoon.

147
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,653
Oh, Bathsheba bathing, well...

148
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,163
You like to swim, Pastor Bud?

149
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,358
Oh, I never learned to swim, I...

150
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,498
His power is perfected
in my weakness in that way.

151
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,334
I used to be a lifeguard.

152
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,874
- You didn't.
- I could teach you.

153
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,171
- No.
- I could.

154
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,007
I could teach you,
yes, I could.

155
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,081
No, I would
just sink like a stone.

156
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,117
<i>You know, the baptism tank,
that's as deep as I could go.</i>

157
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,050
<i>- Ha-ha-ha.
- Never mind about that.</i>

158
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,054
Corinne has some wonderful
news to share with you.

159
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,423
- Really, sweetheart?
- And Kathleen?

160
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,357
- Yes.
- I know this has not been

161
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,226
an easy time since you
lost your baby, I know that.

162
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:52,530
But the Lord can make good
things come out of tragedy.

163
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:57,539
Your family will be strong now with
God at the center. You know that.

164
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,710
All right, you tell your mama
the good news.

165
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,638
Bye.

166
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:06,147
Come on, Pookie.
Come on, Wendy.

167
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,081
Let's go swimming, huh?

168
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,953
Okay, so,
what's the wonderful news?

169
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,985
Hm?

170
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,456
What is it?

171
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,392
- She got saved today.
- Saved from what?

172
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,966
I just raised my hand,
that's all.

173
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,803
Pastor Bud says Jesus knocks on
our heart, but we don't listen.

174
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,238
Maybe he should try
the doorbell instead.

175
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,822
- Sally saw you.
- What? Sally saw me what?

176
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,900
- What, what? What did Sally see?
- I can't trust you.

177
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,127
You can't trust me?

178
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,999
You're making me crazy, all right?

179
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,505
You're making me crazy. I am home.
I am the one who's home here.

180
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,702
I'm taking care of these children.
I'm in this crap house.

181
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,246
I'm the one who's out working,
buying your wigs and your car

182
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,908
and your other crap. So, what
is the issue? What did I do?

183
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,884
I have made every house
that we have lived in a home.

184
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,819
Yeah, well, are we...?

185
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,754
Follow around all your crap.

186
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,257
Yeah, yeah, it's all about me.

187
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,486
What?

188
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,598
All alone.
Yeah, you made us a house, sure, sure.

189
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,662
What is the problem?
What do you want me to say?

190
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,170
Right now, what isn't the problem?

191
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,595
Yeah.

192
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:45,040
You see how big that guy was?
Jesus Christ.

193
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,202
- Hey, guys, I'll catch you in a second.
- All right.

194
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,875
Hey. You're the writer,
aren't you?

195
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,476
- I write. I mean...
- Yeah, you're Corinne Walker, right?

196
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,713
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

197
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,086
I was just on my way to practice.
Do you know The Renegades?

198
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,784
Uh, of course.
Everyone knows The Renegades.

199
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,258
I'm Ethan.

200
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,622
I know.

201
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,264
So, what are you doing?

202
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,604
Um, I'm waiting for my sister
to finish practice.

203
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,132
I meant, what are you writing?

204
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,067
Oh.

205
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,644
Some words and thoughts.

206
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,642
- Thoughts on what?
- Mm, disappointment.

207
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,978
Oh.

208
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,280
We should
write a song together.

209
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,988
For The Renegades?

210
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:40,521
Sure. Yeah. But, um...

211
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,598
I'm not musical.

212
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,969
Maybe you haven't found
your instrument yet.

213
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,471
Tell her she looks pretty.

214
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,806
Just tell her you love her.

215
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,410
Where you going, wildcat?

216
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,379
- Hm? Where do you think you're...?
- Move it.

217
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,217
- No. Mm-mm.
- Move it.

218
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,854
You're gonna have
to get through me.

219
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,044
Ow!

220
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,918
That hurt.

221
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,821
Oh! Don't you dare.

222
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,987
Give me. Give that to me or I'm
gonna kill you. Give me that.

223
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,390
Mine.

224
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,560
- Damn it!
- Oops.

- Free.

00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,344

Do the drum solo right there
and come back.

231
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,192
I like The Renegades.
I've been to concerts.

232
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,798
- I love your music.
- Thanks.

233
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,365
Corrine.

234
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,799
I'm the only freshman
to make it on varsity.

235

Ah.

236
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,441
You're looking at the first guy out in dodge ball.
It's like, every time...

237
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,043
- It's instant. It's...
- Me too.

238
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,704
- I'm always out first. Every single time.
- Yeah?

239
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,043
Knew there's a reason
I loved you so much.

240
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,880
I heard what you said.
You said "I love you."

241
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,151
No, I said I liked her
so much, because...

242
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,155
Yeah, okay.

243
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,418
Get lost, Wendy.

244
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,085
Yeah, Wendy.
Go shoot some hoops or something.

245
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,730
No, I run track.

246

Well, I'm a track monster.

247
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,268
Ew, that's gross.
You guys are disgusting.

00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,346
This is a nice bed, huh?
Yeah. Yeah.

317
00:22:57,076 --> 00:23:00,148
This is the last gig
Abby and I are coming to.

318
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,426
- Yo, what up?
- Look here.

319
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,927
- What's going on, man?
- Party time.

320
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,866
Check out my poopy pants, yeah.

321
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,399
Suck it, bitch!

322
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,668
- We're The Renegades!
- Suck it!

323
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,004
Hey, dickhead!

324
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,238
You wanna get us pulled over?
My kid's in the bus.

325
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,848
- Fucking cut it out!
- Hey!

326
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,682
Hey, fucking cut it out!

327
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,548
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit!

328
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,248
Ethan.

329
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,204
- Where are my drums?
- Let's go.

330
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,269
Abby! Where's...?

331
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,912
Grab the cooler.

332
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,575
Go, get out.

333
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,911
Abby!

334
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,414
You got the cooler?

335
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,611
Abby!

336
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,123
Abby!

337
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,228
Ethan! Where is she?

338
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,665
Where is she?

339
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,732
Abby!

340
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,101
Where's the cooler?!

341
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,898
God!

342
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,810
God, please!

343
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,249
God saved her, Corinne.

344
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,950
God saved us.

345
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:57,464
Okay, let's find out
what God has to say.

346
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,842
Well? Read it.

347
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:13,448
"I will dash your infants
against the rocks."

348
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,224
What?

349
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,787
It's right there.

350
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,468
That's fucked up.

351
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,906
Let's start from the beginning.

352
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,722
- Praise God.
- Praise God.

353
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,981
Hallelujah.

354
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:53,324
This is one fish the Lord has been
trying to hook for a long time.

355
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:58,226
Oh, yeah, that was wild,
you know?

356
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,767
I was just so... Ooh.

357
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,166
I was thinking about
the baby in my womb

358
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,830
- and how far God's brought me.
- Praise God.

359
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:08,501
And my big old happy family.
Aah! What is that?

360
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:12,171
They're all God's creatures, Corinne.
They're all God's creatures.

361
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,951
I've been trying to get her in this lake.
She says, "Ooh, not in this ucky lake."

362
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,180
It's not sanitary."

363
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,684
Come over here.

364
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,918
Newly. Newly.

365
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:30,364
Hold on. I'm getting out of here.
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

366
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,526
<i># Then sings my soul #</i>

367
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:37,799
<i># My savior God to thee #</i>

368
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:44,376
<i># How great thou art #</i>

369
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:49,381
<i># How great thou art #</i>

370
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:54,889
<i># How great thou art #</i>

371
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,227
<i># How great thou art ##</i>

372
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,263
- Thank you, Jesus.
- How you guys doing?

373
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,300
- Hallelujah.
- How are you? Praise God.

374
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,574
- Praise God.
- Praise the Lord.

375
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,768
Another Sunday
and the saints have gathered.

376
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:15,968
Amen!

377
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,741
Do not neglect the
assembling of yourselves

378
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,282
as is the habit of some,

379
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,751
but all the more
as the day draws near.

380
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,787
Hebrews 10:25.

381
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:31,416
And we have assembled ourselves
here today, brothers and sisters,

382
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,926
in God's cathedral.

383
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:36,294
- So beautiful.
- In the splendor of his creation.

384
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:37,490
Mm.

385
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,932
Martin Luther says
that God writes the gospel

386
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,470
not in the Bible alone,

387
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,437
but also in the trees.

388
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,371
Yeah? In the flowers,

389
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,809
- in the clouds, in the stars.
- Hallelujah.

390
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,641
Don't they proclaim
the name of God?

391
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,838
Amen.

392
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,951
- Amen. Amen.
- Amen.

393
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,678
Now, you all know
about Nancy and Al, right?

394
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,481
- Yeah.
- Uh...

395
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,859
Nancy has decided to take
the kids and move to Buffalo.

396
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,188
It's devastating.

397
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,954
They come in for counseling?

398
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,566
I met with them a few times,
but the damage had already been done.

399
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,065
Their marriage was weakened

400
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:17,037
by, um, sexual, um, issues.

401
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,303
What kind of sexual issues?
I don't wanna go into that right now.

402
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:25,710
Brothers, God has put it on my heart to
speak freely with you tonight, okay?

403
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,914
You need to attend
to your wives' needs.

404
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,681
We've got a set of tapes.

405
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:41,162
<i>Christ-Like Sex
by Dr. Frank Barnes.</i>

406
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,398
<i>When it comes
to satisfying your wife, brothers,</i>

407
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:55,039
<i>clitoral stimulation
is part of God's plan.</i>

408
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:59,541
<i>You'll find the clitoris located
toward the top of her labia,</i>

409
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,844
<i>but below the pubic bone.</i>

410
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,216
<i>Let her be your guide
to what feels good.</i>

411
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,254
<i>- Amen.
- She will indicate this</i>

412
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:12,259
<i>with body movements
and various sounds.</i>

413
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,695
<i>It is advisable to apply
one tablespoon of oil or lotion.</i>

414
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:22,533
<i>Direct contact without lubrication
won't please your bride.</i>

415
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,431
Okay.

416
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,935
That's pretty right on.

417
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,043
That's it?

418
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,240
There's more. Um...

419
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,386
There's seven tapes.

420
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:44,058
<i># Nearer, my God to thee #</i>

421
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,961
<i># Nearer to thee #</i>

422
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:57,997
<i># Even when it be #</i>

423
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,575
<i># A cross #</i>

424
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:04,976
<i># That raiseth me #</i>

425
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:12,449
<i># Still all my song #</i>

426
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,852
<i># Shall be ##</i>

427
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,252
God bless you, Mama.

428
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:26,702
- Stay for lunch.
- I can't. Ned's waiting for his lunch.

429
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,599
It's daytime.

430
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,934
So? Who cares?

431
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,306
What about you?

432
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,144
How many times a week?

433
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,448
- A week?
- Mm-hm.

434
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:47,014
Like once a week.

435
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,983
- Honey...
- Maybe.

436
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,128
Maybe?

437
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,153
Honey, you...

438
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:57,159
You cannot let sexual
chemistry burn out.

439
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,563
- You cannot.
- What if it does?

440
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,966
You have to spice it up.

441
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:05,131
Show him how much
you admire him.

442
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,971
I like to draw Ned's penis.

443
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,346
No, no.

444
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:16,884
- It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's art.
- Ha-ha-ha!

445
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,656
I'm drawing Ned's.

446
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,198
And you're gonna draw Ethan's.

447
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,663
Listen to me.

448
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,772
He is gonna be so flattered.

449
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,400
Ned loves looking
at his penis drawings.

450
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,872
And he has such a...

451
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,576
Ah...

452
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,719
- I call it Shamu. Stop it.
- Ha-ha-ha.

453
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,396
They're so weird.

454
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,625
It's God's design.

455
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,634
Yeah, but it's
a strange design.

456
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,603
Listen, the human body
is beautiful, period.

457
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,900
It...

458
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,771
It brings glory to God.

459
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,282
Shamu.

460
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,719
- What?
- Ouch. Ouch.

461
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:31,623
Listen, nothing a little olive
oil can't take care of.

462
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,761
Let me see yours.

463
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,892
It's a little crooked.

464
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,670
Well...

465
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,573
it's long.

466
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,181
Okay.

467
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,198
Hi.

468
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,461
- Wendy.
- Hi.

469
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,263
Hi.

470
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:20,001
- What did you do to your hair?
- Yeah, I fucked myself with Sun-In.

471
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,838
But it's cool because
I have Mom's wig.

472
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,438
Uh, listen, Rich kicked me out.

473
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,776
And I don't really have
anywhere to go.

474
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,781
So...

475
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,782
Sleep over?

476
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,287
Your girls are gorgeous.

477
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,790
Hey, you could be
a beauty queen.

478
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,317
You could be Miss USA.

479
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,620
We're all beautiful
in God's eyes.

480
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,130
- Hold it down in the front.
- I am holding it down.

481
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:48,161
Man looks at the outward appearance,
but God looks at the heart. Right?

482
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,361
Mm-hm.

483
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,804
We pray for you every day.
Don't we, girls?

484
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:52,964
Yeah.

485
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,338
We ask God
to open Aunt Wendy's eyes

486
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,036
and to save her from hell.

487
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,145
Thank you.
I really... I really appreciate that.

488
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,504
What was that?

489
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,543
It's the gift of tongues.

490
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,542
It's a prayer language.

491
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,942
- A prayer language?
- Uh-huh.

492
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,709
That's beautiful. What...?

493
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,578
How does it work?

494
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,915
Scripture says, he who speaks
in tongues edifies himself.

495
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,354
It builds me up.

496
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:47,258
It's like charging my battery.

497
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,861
Can you do it
any time you want?

498
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,931
Any time I'm in the spirit.

499
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,866
So do you know
what you're saying?

500
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,263
I have no idea.

501
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,066
- You don't?
- No, I...

502
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,766
I just know it's what God
wants me to say.

503
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,378
It's so holy.
You sounded like an angel.

504
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,038
What does it feel like?
What does it feels like when...?

505
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,047
Uh...

506
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,254
It settles things in your spirit.

507
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,545
I want it.

508
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,214
You get everything.

509
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,792
You do. I want it.

510
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,397
It's gotta... It's what...
That's what I need.

511
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,400
That's exactly what I need.
I want it. I'm gonna get it.

512
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,233
I wanna get it. Ha-ha-ha.

513
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,068
Daddy, veggie burger?

514
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,234
Uh...
It looks delicious.

515
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,846
Jesus, you could feed this
to the geese.

516
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:41,075
- They are very high in protein.
- Yeah, I bet.

517
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,276
Very low in cholesterol.

518
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,421
- Get used to the taste.
- Good for you.

519
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,921
- Yeah, not anymore.
- Cheese.

520
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,081
What's good for me
is seeing my girls.

521
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,352
Isn't he sweet?

522
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,928
I am so pissed off
at that stinking asshole.

523
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,828
- If I see him, I'm gonna crack him.
- Daddy, Daddy, Dad.

524
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,595
- Your vocabulary.
- Sorry.

525
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:04,502
I'm ticked off at Rich and the
way he's done my Wendybug.

526
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,698
Thank you.

527
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,935
- You're better off without him.
- I know.

528
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,773
Corinne will help you
get back on your feet.

529
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,312
What do you say, squirt?

530
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,275
Why is Aunt Wendy so nice
when she doesn't know Jesus?

531
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:21,618
Well, because, hon, it's not enough to
just be nice or just do good things.

532
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,791
A man is justified by faith
apart from works of the law.

533
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,797
God will justify
those circumcised by faith.

534
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,899
What's "circus sized"?

535
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:33,229
That's when you get cut off
from the circus.

536
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,201
I'm nice to you
because I love you.

537
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,808
So that's it. I love you.
I don't have to have a reason.

538
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,207
Kids are the best things
in life.

539
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:49,143
Losing your baby brother,

540
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,378
heh, that destroyed my marriage.

541
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,525
God, I regret that.

542
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,827
Ease off the clutch
and press the gas.

543
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,829
Ease and press.

544
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,489
It's like making love,
you know?

545
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,193
Come on, rev it up.

546
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,393
You can do it.

547
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:10,831
- You can do it.
- Oh.

548
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,099
Oh, oh, oh.

549
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,833
Okay.

550
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,583
Satan's doing
a real number on you,

551
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,219
but you know what?
I'm gonna bind him.

552
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,718
- Okay.
- I'm gonna bind him right now.

553
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:29,381
- Satan, you have no power over us.
- No, you don't.

554
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,689
We are children of God, Satan,
and we reject your fiery darts.

555
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,025
- We reject your lies.
- Yes.

556
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,134
We denounce you.
You're a fallen angel doomed to hell

557
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,236
- forever and ever.
- Amen.

558
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,202
Get thee behind us, Satan.
Get thee behind us.

559
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,865
Yeah, get lost, Bub!
Get lost!

560
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,135
Bub?

561
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,074
Bub. Yes.

562
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,909
You know, Satan is Beelzebub.

563
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,709
<i>The Lord of the Flies.</i>

564
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,147
The book.

565
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,719
Get lost, Bub.
That's great.

566
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,055
Oh, no.

567
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,088
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Pull over. Pull over.

568
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:09,232
It's not Satan, but it's just as bad.
Pull over.

569
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,564
Another very important
driving lesson:

570
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,971
Charm the cop.

571
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,941
Hello,
Mr. Policia. Hello. Oh.

572
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:33,248
What a beautiful mustache
you have. It's so manly.

573
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,516
Very beautiful.

574
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:40,125
- You're a long way from home, ma'am.
- Yes, I am, but I so loving America.

575
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:43,425
I'm stopping you for doing
15 miles an hour over the limit.

576
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:47,263
- That's a direct threat to your safety.
- I had a wedgie.

577
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,768
- A what?
- A wedgie.

578
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,973
Do you know what this is,
the wedgie?

579
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:54,042
My underwear inside
my pooskie-nooskie.

580
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,203
Oh, my...
Oh, it split my kaka in half.

581
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,938
Backwards, forward.

582
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,777
I was squirming, my friend,
not know what to do.

583
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,149
- License and registration, please.
- Yes, sir.

584
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,225
Shoot. Take this. Here it is.

585
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,627
- And where's my registration?
- Here.

586
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:19,200
It's a learner's permit, sir.

587
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,903
Keep your mind on the road,
Miss Miller.

588
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,871
You know, the Bible says

589
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,573
we need to keep our minds
set on things above.

590
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:35,809
But I can do that

591
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:39,148
and concentrate on the road
at the same time, and I will.

592
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,150
And I hope your problem
got solved, ma'am.

593
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,089
Oh. Thank you, yes.
Everything down there very beautiful.

594
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,320
I just pluck it out.

595
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,519
Okay.

596
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,358
- Thank you.
- Very deep caverns there.

597
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,658
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you, sir.

598
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,062
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

599
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,665
A wedgie?

600
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,863
Yes, I had a wedgie.

601
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,736
I'm gonna give you a wedgie.

602
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,372
Stop. Stop.

603
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,082
<i># I've got a river of life
Flowin' out of me #</i>

604
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,517
<i># Makes the lame to walk
And the blind to see #</i>

605
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:17,224
<i># Opens the prison doors
Sets the captives free #</i>

606
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:20,556
<i># I've got a river of life
Flowin' out of me #</i>

607
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:24,359
<i># Spring up, O well
Within my soul #</i>

608
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,704
<i># Spring up, O well
And make me whole #</i>

609
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,967
<i># Spring up, O well
And give to me #</i>

610
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:36,977
<i># That life abundantly ##</i>

611
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,740
I like that.

612
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,418
That one always makes me
wanna dance for the Lord.

613
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,056
Uh, listen, before we start,
I wanna welcome, uh...

614
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,957
Sorry, where did she go?
Corinne's sister, Wendy.

615
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,620
Let's give a warm welcome.

616
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,059
Uh, now, let's give
a hot hand clap for Jesus.

617
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,961
Listen, before we start,
I wanna, uh...

618
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,801
I wanna open up the floor
to the body of believers.

619
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,103
If anybody has anything
they wanna share.

620
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,906
Anything that's on their hearts.

621
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,641
To edify the saints. Anybody?

622
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,743
No?

623
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,683
Okay.

624
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,784
Yeah, um...

625
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:26,793
I was praying with a sister
for her rebellious child

626
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,931
and, um...

627
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:34,831
after we asked God for help,

628
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,974
we thanked him
for answering our prayers

629
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,769
because he will answer it,
you know?

630
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:44,106
As we're told in Thess...
Thess... Thess...

631
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:50,283
My, that is a tongue twister.
In, uh, Thessalonians, um...

632
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,943
Hold on.

633
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,817
As we're told in Thessalonians,
uh, you know,

634
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:59,656
God wants us to come to him
with all our needs and all our desires.

635
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,457
If you want the Ganders
to have a winning season.

636
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,655
If you want it, you know...

637
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,357
It'll take a miracle.

638
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,366
But I'll pray anyway.

639
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:11,139
And then I'll thank him when
they choke in the fourth quarter

640
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,969
like they always do.
But that's faith, isn't it?

641
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,405
Isn't that what makes us
different from the world?

642
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,139
That we believe
even though we don't see?

643
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,911
Faith is the substance
of things hoped for,

644
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,818
- the evidence of things not seen.
- You can sit down now.

645
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,323
- That's what it says in Hebrews, right?
- Thank you.

646
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,325
Uh, I see you have been
hitting your Bible studies.

647
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,054
God bless you.

648
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,493
Power of the holy word.

649
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,725
Uh, I don't know
who you were praying with.

650
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,063
And you know what?
I don't have to know.

651
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:45,674
It's okay, but I just wanna say, if
that woman wants to come to me directly

652
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,867
uh, or any of the elders
of the church,

653
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:51,070
we'd be privileged to sit down
and pray with her, okay?

654
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:55,012
Um, does anybody have a burden
on their heart they wanna share?

655
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,709
Ned, go ahead.

656
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,855
- What's on your mind, brother?
- Uh, a couple things.

657
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:01,851
Sister?

658
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,788
Yeah. I'm sorry.

659
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,920
You came very close
to preaching just now.

660
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:13,900
We have to be so careful not to appear
as though we're teaching the men.

661
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,766
- No. I didn't mean to.
- I know. I know.

662
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:20,068
And you were so sincere
and I know your heart.

663
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:22,711
And I know you wanna
submit to God in all ways.

664
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:26,280
- Of course, that's all I wanna do.
- I know. I know.

665
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,585
- Okay, of course.
- Good.

666
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,429
Okay.

667
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:45,398
Hmm. Come on.
Come on, Holy Spirit.

668
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48,469
Come on.

669
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,902
I will love you, Father God.

670
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,338
Oh, Holy Spirit.

671
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:54,568
Thank you, Lord.

672
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,809
Oh. Father God.

673
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,075
Come on in.

674
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,843
Come on.

675
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:23,635
Come on, Lord.
Come on, Holy Spirit.

676
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,967
Just wash down on me, Lord.
Just...

677
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,169
<i># Come in thy strength
And thy power #</i>

678
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,610
Get thee behind me.

679
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:37,111
<i># Come in thine own
Gentle way ##</i>

680
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,456
Try later.

681
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,824
- Wend?
- Yep.

682
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,397
I have a system.

683
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:52,626
Okay, what's your system?

684
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,136
- Look at the edges.
- Right.

685
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,164
- Half.
- Mm-hm.

686
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,569
- Half.
- Right.

687
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,302
- Thirds.
- Oh.

688
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,078
- Look.
- Okay.

689
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,875
Okay, okay, okay.

690
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,382
Half.

691
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,384
Half, thirds.
I'm doing it with the wrist.

692
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,551
Half. Ow. Ha-ha-ha.

693
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,984
I'm doing the towels.

694
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:19,361
Hi, Brownie. Hi, Spotty.

695
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:22,691
What you doing, Spotty?
What you doing, Brownie?

696
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,527
Mm. Are you hungry?
Are you hungry?

697
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,761
You have a stomachache?

698
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,233
You say "yes."

699
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,838
You say "no."

700
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:39,174
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- My undies.

701
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:42,181
- Ha-ha-ha. What is this?
- Why?

702
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,877
How do you...? What is...?
How do you wear this?

703
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,723
What is this? Ha, ha!
How do you wear this?

704
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,917
- How do you fold this thing? Ha, ha!
- Half. Half.

705
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,120
- Thirds.
- Okay.

706
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,856
Okay, half. Half.

707
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:58,932
We're going into
origami territory.

708
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,569
Hold on, what could this be?

709
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,541
Hey, Lily, what are you doing?

710
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:08,066
What are you...?

711
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:09,873
Hey. Come on.

712
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,069
Come on, honey.

713
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,305
Come on.

714
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,416
Wendy!

715
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,084
Hey!

716
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,210
- Okay, okay.
- Get that out of my house!

717
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:20,879
- What is this?
- Give it to me.

718
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:24,083
Do you see this?

719
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,886
- Look at me, hon.
- No, no, no.

720
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,724
We're answerable to God.
I'm not giving it back.

721
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,423
It's not yours. It's not mine.
I don't use that.

722
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:32,966
Who has drugs
but doesn't use them?

723
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,799
- I'm holding it. I'm a safe house.
- We gave you a safe house.

724
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:40,773
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.

725
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,305
- Come here. You put it in your mouth?
- No.

726
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,947
- You sure? Drink.
- Mm-hm.

727
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,410
Let's do it.

728
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,418
Drink, okay? Drink.

729
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,248
- What are you doing?
- Face.

730
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,757
- Get right with God, Wendy.
- Shit.

731
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,323
It's not for me!

732
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,260
What? Peace, righteousness?
Eternal life?

733
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:04,798
Which one is not for you?

734
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:09,434
I don't want your life, Corinne.
I'll take my fucked-up one instead.

735
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,103
Scrub, scrub.

736
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,921
That's a nice dress.

737
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:45,081
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

738
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,457
- It's new.
- Yeah? I like the flounce.

739
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,121
You notice these growing
up in a house of girls.

740
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:52,527
I imagine you would.

741
00:48:52,701 --> 00:48:54,100
- Corinne.
- Ha, ha. Yeah?

742
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:56,703
- Could I borrow you for a sec?
- Sure.

743
00:48:57,706 --> 00:48:58,832
Okay.

744
00:49:06,114 --> 00:49:09,845
I so don't mean to pick on you, but
scriptures tell the older women

745
00:49:10,018 --> 00:49:12,953
- to teach the younger women.
- Sure. What's wrong?

746
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:14,486
Your dress.

747
00:49:14,856 --> 00:49:15,982
My dress?

748
00:49:16,157 --> 00:49:18,455
- What? It's a maternity dress.
- I know.

749
00:49:19,127 --> 00:49:21,288
It caught Luke's attention.

750
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:25,455
You don't wanna
make a brother stumble.

751
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:27,658
No.

752
00:49:28,837 --> 00:49:30,896
It's true.

753
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,302
Pray about it. I just...

754
00:49:35,477 --> 00:49:37,308
I don't think
you should wear it again.

755
00:49:56,164 --> 00:49:58,826
Why don't we
believe in tongues?

756
00:50:00,568 --> 00:50:02,331
Because we don't.

757
00:50:03,004 --> 00:50:05,029
Look, it's...

758
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,273
I mean, it's nonsensical.
It's probably voodoo.

759
00:50:08,443 --> 00:50:10,877
You don't believe every spirit,
you test them.

760
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:12,706
You see which ones are of God.

761
00:50:13,214 --> 00:50:15,739
Annika prayed for me
in tongues.

762
00:50:17,419 --> 00:50:21,753
She called it a prayer language.
I thought it was so beautiful.

763
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,455
- Does Ned know about that?
- What difference does it make?

764
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:28,528
She's worshipping God.
It makes her feel closer to him.

765
00:50:28,696 --> 00:50:31,096
- There can't be anything wrong with...
- Corinne.

766
00:50:31,266 --> 00:50:33,860
Intelligent people
don't mutter to themselves.

767
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:37,368
The deceiver comes disguised
as an angel of light.

768
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:38,870
You know that.

769
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:42,635
Did you understand her?

770
00:50:42,811 --> 00:50:44,711
- No.
- There you go.

771
00:50:45,113 --> 00:50:46,740
God is not a God of confusion.

772
00:50:46,915 --> 00:50:50,316
Just because something sounds
beautiful doesn't mean it's good.

773
00:50:51,252 --> 00:50:53,743
Polish gibberish.

774
00:50:53,922 --> 00:50:54,946
You okay?

775
00:50:56,324 --> 00:50:57,382
Can I fix you something?

776
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,720
No, I'm...
I can't keep anything down.

777
00:50:59,894 --> 00:51:00,952
I don't want any.

778
00:51:01,129 --> 00:51:02,926
Aw, but you have to.

779
00:51:03,097 --> 00:51:06,430
You have to, so imagine

780
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:09,399
if you could eat anything
in the world right now,

781
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:11,436
what would it be?

782
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:13,669
I would have, um...

783
00:51:16,478 --> 00:51:19,572
A white bread bologna sandwich

784
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:23,740
with iceberg lettuce
and Miracle Whip.

785
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:27,149
- I don't have any of that.
- Oh...

786
00:51:27,322 --> 00:51:30,587
We're a strictly whole wheat
and legume family.

787
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:32,756
But I'm gonna go get it.

788
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:34,690
- You will?
- Yeah.

789
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:37,427
Our bodies tell us
what we need.

790
00:51:40,435 --> 00:51:42,665
Okay, let's go.

791
00:51:44,939 --> 00:51:47,840
- Nika. Nika.
- Yeah?

792
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:53,447
And can you get a cupcake

793
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:55,639
with pink frosting?

794
00:51:56,017 --> 00:51:57,348
Just a really big one.

795
00:51:57,986 --> 00:52:00,284
- A big one? Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

796
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:07,723
Ready? Unh.

797
00:52:09,163 --> 00:52:11,154
Mm.

798
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:12,990
- Feels nice.
- Mm.

799
00:53:26,207 --> 00:53:30,371
Wow, you really do appreciate
a good foot rub, huh?

800
00:53:33,948 --> 00:53:37,213
There are ways of dealing
with a backslider. Compassion.

801
00:53:37,385 --> 00:53:39,444
Other times,
you snatch them back,

802
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:41,555
and there's a time
to let them go.

803
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:43,384
I don't understand that.

804
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:46,083
Okay, well, I think
for the first part, it's...

805
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,285
With believers
that haven't matured,

806
00:53:48,463 --> 00:53:50,761
be tender,
treat them with kindness.

807
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:53,901
Can't expect them to eat
the meat of the word right away.

808
00:53:54,068 --> 00:53:57,902
- Baby believers need, um...
- Mm-hm?

809
00:53:58,072 --> 00:53:59,403
Need to drink milk.

810
00:53:59,574 --> 00:54:02,509
What does it mean to snatch
someone from the fire?

811
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,572
Is that a metaphor?
Or does that mean hell?

812
00:54:05,747 --> 00:54:07,146
I think it's both.

813
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:10,944
You know,
temptation is consuming.

814
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,782
Like fire.
You know, it can devour us.

815
00:54:19,293 --> 00:54:20,920
Mm-hm.

816
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:23,021
Um...

817
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:25,789
Do you know you have a lisp?

818
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,928
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, you do.

819
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:30,092
Absolutely.

820
00:54:33,274 --> 00:54:36,539
Um... "With some, you
must deal with mingled fear and pity,"

821
00:54:36,711 --> 00:54:39,271
hating even the garments
soiled with sin."

822
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:40,505
- Hate.
- Yeah.

823
00:54:40,682 --> 00:54:44,015
- That's a strong word.
- Hey, that reminds me.

824
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:46,278
Did my work pants get washed?

825
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:49,614
I don't know.

826
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:53,627
All right, well,
maybe I'll go check on them.

827
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:55,660
Is that 9:17?

828
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:59,391
- I may just go to bed while I'm at it.
- I don't know, I lost... Sure.

829
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:01,626
- Do me a favor? Um...
- Yeah.

830
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,370
- Lock the door when you're done.
- Okay.

831
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:05,631
Yeah.

832
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:07,638
- Night.
- Yeah.

833
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,174
- Take care.
- Good night.

834
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:10,367
Love you.

835
00:55:10,545 --> 00:55:12,479
Hey, don't keep her up
too late, bro.

836
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:13,739
She needs her rest.

837
00:55:13,915 --> 00:55:16,816
I get it. She's a miracle
happening right before our eyes.

838
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,508
Mm-hm.

839
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:20,881
Every woman deserves
to look like you do.

840
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:23,046
- Oh. Like a hippo?
- That's the truth.

841
00:55:23,758 --> 00:55:28,388
Pregnancy is the lady hippo's
crowning glory.

842
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:32,224
- Taking my breath away all night.
- Oh, so sweet. So...

843
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,167
<i># Kumbayah, my Lord Kumbayah #</i>

844
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:41,705
<i># Oh, Lord Kumbayah ##</i>

845
00:55:43,344 --> 00:55:47,007
<i>Do you know "kumbayah"
means "come by here"?</i>

846
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:48,239
In Hawaiian.

847
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:50,907
The missionaries
brought it back.

848
00:55:52,386 --> 00:55:54,183
Father God,

849
00:55:54,355 --> 00:55:58,587
<i>how grateful we are
that you will indeed kumbayah.</i>

850
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,519
You won't see our
righteousness as filthy rags

851
00:56:03,698 --> 00:56:05,393
but because of Jesus,

852
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,392
you no longer see our hearts
as corrupt and wicked.

853
00:56:09,771 --> 00:56:13,366
I know we wearily
try your patience,

854
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,532
but you are gracious

855
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:19,544
and withhold the rod of judgment
we so richly deserve.

856
00:56:20,748 --> 00:56:23,717
We are healed by his stripes

857
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:27,582
and all our iniquities
are laid upon him.

858
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:31,325
Worthy is the lamb
that was slain

859
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:35,223
for such a degenerate
and undeserving people.

860
00:56:36,597 --> 00:56:39,395
- Amen.
- Amen.

861
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:40,793
Thank you, Deborah.

862
00:56:42,503 --> 00:56:45,097
Do you think I should
cancel that singles retreat?

863
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:48,640
- Oh, no.
- I don't think there's a lot of turnout.

864
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,903
- We'll pray about it.
- Yeah.

865
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:53,410
Deborah loves the Lord
and she means well,

866
00:56:53,581 --> 00:56:57,244
but her sermons are starting
to make me feel suicidal.

867
00:56:59,787 --> 00:57:03,188
She uses a lot of W words.

868
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:07,293
Eleven W words
in the last three sentences.

869
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:10,825
Look at her dress.

870
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,033
What's wrong?

871
00:57:18,806 --> 00:57:21,502
A headache.
I've been getting whoppers lately.

872
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:24,167
We should have prayed
for you instead of Hawaii.

873
00:57:24,345 --> 00:57:28,543
Hey, everyone. Rebekah's made
carob brownies. Come on.

874
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:32,110
- You know what carob tastes like?
- Chocolate?

875
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:34,117
Disappointment.

876
00:57:41,629 --> 00:57:43,460
He can hold up the whole
world with his pinkie.

877
00:57:44,966 --> 00:57:48,197
I mean, that's crazy strong.

878
00:57:48,836 --> 00:57:50,633
How strong is your dad?

879
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:52,796
- Hello?
- Stronger than Mom for sure.

880
00:57:52,974 --> 00:57:56,307
<i>- Corrine. Hi, it's Ned.
- Hi, Ned.</i>

881
00:57:56,477 --> 00:57:58,206
<i>- That's right.
- Uh...</i>

882
00:58:00,882 --> 00:58:02,975
<i>We just got back
from the emergency room.</i>

883
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,380
Aw. What's wrong?

884
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:07,243
Uh...

885
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:10,649
Annika had a seizure today.

886
00:58:11,525 --> 00:58:13,152
<i>Worst thing I've ever seen.</i>

887
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:15,893
The poor kids were screaming.
Um...

888
00:58:16,063 --> 00:58:17,087
Big.

889
00:58:17,265 --> 00:58:20,166
<i>- We got her to the emergency room.
- There's nothing</i>

890
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:23,235
- that our God can't do.
- Well, what's wrong with her?

891
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:27,033
Uh, could you put Ethan
on the phone?

892
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:30,507
No, Ned. No, I won't.
Tell me, what's going on with Annika?

893
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:34,841
It looks like
she has a brain tumor.

894
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,911
<i>- Let's do it.
- Probably malignant.</i>

895
00:58:37,084 --> 00:58:40,178
<i>- Let me see your hand.
- But, you know, operable.</i>

896
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:43,181
Okay.

897
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,018
Okay, Ned. Um...

898
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:48,051
I'm gonna be over in 20 minutes
to help you out.

899
00:58:48,229 --> 00:58:50,527
- There's nothing.
- Nothing.

900
00:58:50,698 --> 00:58:52,529
Nothing

901
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:56,733
that our God can't do.

902
00:58:57,305 --> 00:58:59,239
That's right.

903
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,544
Are you wearing a padded bra?

904
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:08,238
Yes. Ha, ha.

905
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:10,281
- I like it.
- Ha-ha-ha.

906
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:11,713
It's so soft.

907
00:59:13,888 --> 00:59:15,150
Good. Okay.

908
00:59:15,323 --> 00:59:16,813
I'm glad.

909
00:59:17,091 --> 00:59:19,616
Oh. Okay.

910
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:24,392
So, you know, it's times like this
I wish I had a prayer language.

911
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:26,430
So the Holy Spirit
would pray for me.

912
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,092
Yeah. Mine dried up a few days ago.
I don't know why.

913
00:59:31,505 --> 00:59:33,268
Okay. Um...

914
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:42,007
Father God, um,

915
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:46,113
Annika is your little lamb.

916
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,752
She's your precious daughter

917
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,315
and she's scared.

918
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,151
- Ooh.
- Heh-heh.

919
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:56,928
That's all me, baby.

920
00:59:57,098 --> 01:00:00,261
That's all you.
Okay, shh, listen.

921
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:02,425
And she's scared.

922
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:08,173
Uh, bring her through this valley.
Lord, hold her close.

923
01:00:08,342 --> 01:00:10,037
Um...

924
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:13,374
Give her peace that passes
all understanding.

925
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:15,946
Um...

926
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:17,516
Thank you for your healing.

927
01:00:17,685 --> 01:00:20,779
Thank you for this healing,
thank you for making her whole.

928
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:22,217
Yeah?

929
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:26,349
We pray this in the name of the savior
and give you all the praise and glory.

930
01:00:26,527 --> 01:00:28,392
- Amen.
- Amen.

931
01:00:30,398 --> 01:00:31,831
Amen.

932
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,361
PS...

933
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:37,695
- Get lost, Bub.
- Ha-ha-ha.

934
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:41,001
- I feel him.
- Yeah.

935
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:42,699
- God's here.
- Yeah.

936
01:00:43,411 --> 01:00:46,972
<i># God is so good #</i>

937
01:00:47,148 --> 01:00:50,481
<i># He's so good to me #</i>

938
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:52,983
God answers prayer.

939
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:58,083
<i># God answers prayer #</i>

01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:13,235
Right here, right now, Lord.

944
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:15,341
Right here, right now.

945
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:18,000
- They got it all. She's gonna live.
- Praise God.

946
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:19,510
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Whoo!

947
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,874
- This is good.
- Praise God.

948

Thank you, Jesus.

949
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:27,746
They're telling me that she's
not gonna be herself, though.

950
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:29,916
What does that mean?

951
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:32,624
It can mean a lot
of different things.

952
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,860
A lot of different things?

953
01:01:35,196 --> 01:01:39,098
I guess part of her brain was
damaged when they removed the tumor.

954
01:01:39,467 --> 01:01:42,300
Our God is the God who delivers.

955
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:45,371
And he has delivered our sister

956
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:47,769
from the shadow
of the valley of death,

957
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:50,240
and so we thank God tonight.

958
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:56,748
We rejoice with Ned and Annika
and their beautiful kids.

959
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:00,486
Ned.

960
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:12,063
The Lord God has been
your strength and your shield.

961
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:13,894
Jehovah-jireh. Amen?

962
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:15,501
Amen.

963
01:02:15,669 --> 01:02:18,399
He has provided for you.

964
01:02:19,073 --> 01:02:21,268
His ways are not our ways.

965
01:02:21,642 --> 01:02:25,237
But we trust in his infinite mercy,

966
01:02:27,681 --> 01:02:29,911
his loving kindness.

967
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,919
Uh...

968
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:39,085
Last night, our son Joel

969
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,023
looked up at me and he said:

970
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:44,756
"Blimey, Da, I'm knackered."
Ha-ha-ha.

971
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,694
It just...
That just cracked me up

972
01:02:48,869 --> 01:02:50,302
because, you know,

973
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:54,532
of course, Annika was the one
who taught him to say that.

974
01:02:57,344 --> 01:03:01,337
See, Annika loves the Lord,

975
01:03:01,515 --> 01:03:05,281
but she also loves drama
and art and nature.

976
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:10,014
And she has this uncanny
ability to find the good

977
01:03:10,191 --> 01:03:13,524
in what other people might
call misfortune or tragedy.

978
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:17,624
And I just want you all to know
that Annika and I are content

979
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:21,359
to walk the path
the Lord has us on.

980
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:27,301
It is not a path we would have chosen
for ourselves, but his will, not ours.

981
01:03:28,175 --> 01:03:32,737
God has called all of us to life
and life more abundant.

982
01:03:32,913 --> 01:03:35,473
And that's the life that
Annika has always lived.

983
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:36,638
And I...

984
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,819
I love you with all of my heart.

985
01:03:47,895 --> 01:03:49,658
Thank you, everyone.

986
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:58,504
<i># When peace like a river #</i>

You have anything
you wanna do for God?

1000
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:56,226
What? Oh, my gosh.

1001
01:04:57,831 --> 01:05:01,232
Can you go like this at the same time?
All right! Ha-ha-ha.

1002
01:05:01,502 --> 01:05:03,470
Give these guys a big hand.

1003
01:05:03,637 --> 01:05:04,729
Amen.

1004
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:07,430
You guys are amazing.
Here we go, buddy.

1005
01:05:07,608 --> 01:05:10,076
Oh, my gosh.
Don't break your legs.

1006
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:13,236
Um... Wow, how do you follow
an act like that?

1007
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:15,109
Good night.

1008
01:05:15,282 --> 01:05:19,582
I don't know about you guys,
but that kind of faith humbles me.

1009
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:22,415
You know what I mean?
It makes me ask myself

1010
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:26,355
is my faith now the same faith
that I started out with?

1011
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,519
You know what I mean?
God says in the book of Revelation:

1012
01:05:29,697 --> 01:05:34,327
Because you are lukewarm,
I will spew you out of my mouth.

1013
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:39,166
You ever take a big old swig of...
Swig of day-old coffee?

1014
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,605
You get up in the morning,
you need something hot and bracing.

1015
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:46,007
You get something that tastes like
yesterday's newspaper, all bleh.

1016
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,306
Damp and moldy?

1017
01:05:47,481 --> 01:05:50,644
Well, God is asking
the same thing of some of us.

1018
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:53,013
He says, "You know what, guys?"

1019
01:05:53,187 --> 01:05:56,281
Give me hot coffee
or give me cold coffee,

1020
01:05:56,457 --> 01:05:58,482
"but none of this in-between stuff."

1021
01:05:58,659 --> 01:06:02,356
We can't serve God and serve
the world at the same time.

1022
01:06:02,529 --> 01:06:03,860
Just can't do it.

1023
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:05,726
It's like serving two women.

1024
01:06:05,899 --> 01:06:07,161
How's that sound, guys?

1025
01:06:07,334 --> 01:06:08,631
Ha!

1026
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:10,133
Hard enough
to keep one wife happy,

1027
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:12,204
no offense to you, sisters.

1028
01:06:12,373 --> 01:06:14,807
But you do keep us hopping.

1029
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:17,307
Uh, Deborah now tells me
that the hair in my ears

1030
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:18,536
is unattractive.

1031
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:22,175
I need to keep it trimmed.
Did you guys know about this?

1032
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:25,375
And the...
And the hairs in your nose too.

1033
01:06:25,552 --> 01:06:29,818
This is... This is awful.
I'm falling apart here, I tell you what.

1034
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:33,721
And this middle-age stuff, it is...
It's not for sissies.

1035
01:06:33,894 --> 01:06:35,327
No way. And, uh...

1036
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:39,398
Oh, now, they got
these things called skin tags.

1037
01:06:39,566 --> 01:06:42,729
That's what they call them?
Say that. Isn't that delightful?

1038
01:06:42,903 --> 01:06:46,669
That sounds so good, skin tags.
It's one of these things right here.

1039
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,331
You see that?
I'm like a horror show.

1040
01:06:51,512 --> 01:06:53,673
But Deborah, she still loves me.

1041
01:06:54,348 --> 01:06:56,179
She still loves me.

1042
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:03,017
God is the same way.
He's saying:

1043
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:08,025
"I love you so much that I want your
whole heart, I don't want a part of it."

1044
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:12,097
I don't want it on your good days.
I don't want it when you feel like it.

1045
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:14,530
"I want it every day
in every way."

1046
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:16,396
Amen? Amen.

1047
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,868
- Dear Lord,
- Dear Lord,

1048
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,236
- thank you
- thank you

1049
01:07:22,409 --> 01:07:25,537
- for this spaghetti.
- for this spaghetti.

1050
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:28,143
It's so yummy

1051
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:33,550
- and it is so good
- Mm-hm.

1052
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,247
That God didn't put mushrooms
and meatballs in it.

1053
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:42,257
Amen. Amen.

1054
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:45,626
- Thank you, Lord.
- Hey, hon, could you pass me the...?

1055
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:48,330
- Hm?
- Can you pass me the butter?

1056
01:07:48,502 --> 01:07:49,628
Yeah.

1057
01:07:50,604 --> 01:07:53,164
What do you think?
I tried a new recipe.

1058
01:07:54,341 --> 01:07:55,399
Hm?

1059
01:07:55,576 --> 01:07:57,134
- Good. Mm-hm.
- Yeah?

1060
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,006
On a scale of one to 10?

1061
01:07:59,179 --> 01:08:01,306
Is there a knife?

1062
01:08:01,482 --> 01:08:02,506
Hm?

1063
01:08:02,683 --> 01:08:05,481
- Is there a knife?
- Scale of one to 10?

1064
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:08,986
- Ten.
- Thank you, ladies.

1065
01:08:09,156 --> 01:08:10,589
- It's good.
- Ten.

1066
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:13,021
- Thank you.
- Ten and a half.

1067
01:08:13,193 --> 01:08:15,491
Mm. Mm.

1068
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:24,803
Hey.

1069
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,770
Hey.

1070
01:08:27,207 --> 01:08:28,970
Do you need anything?

1071
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:31,769
Just wanted to be
with you for a minute.

1072
01:08:32,012 --> 01:08:33,775
I guess.

1073
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:36,609
Kids always around wanting you.

1074
01:08:44,892 --> 01:08:47,861
Why do you turn your head
when I kiss you?

1075
01:08:48,028 --> 01:08:50,223
No, I don't.

1076
01:09:01,074 --> 01:09:03,702
See? You do.
Why do you do that?

1077
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:07,477
I'm not sure.

1078
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,484
Try not to.

1079
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:23,824
- Mm. I'm starving.
- We should go get something to eat

1080
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:26,557
- after we're done here.
- Yeah, if we're not too tired.

1081
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,762
- We gotta eat.
- Yeah.

1082
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:32,269
We can go to Tony C's
for a chili dog.

1083
01:09:32,606 --> 01:09:35,837
Not very romantic, a chili dog.

1084
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:38,039
It can be.

1085
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:41,412
You could try, Corinne.
At least I try.

1086
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:42,674
Mm. Here we go.

1087
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:47,380
Good job, Gabe.

1088
01:09:48,755 --> 01:09:50,188
You know what the problem is?

1089
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:52,848
They can't tell who's on what...
Whose team.

1090
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:56,018
Problem is, he needs to spend time
on his memory verses.

1091
01:09:56,196 --> 01:09:59,688
- Girls could recite chapters at his age.
- Girls? Well, the girls.

1092
01:09:59,866 --> 01:10:01,527
He's a boy. It's different.

1093
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:04,102
All the more reason
to train him in the way.

1094
01:10:05,305 --> 01:10:07,432
He's fine.
I love him just the way he is.

1095
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:11,476
I don't? God doesn't? Why do you twist
everything around all the time?

1096
01:10:11,645 --> 01:10:13,442
Why make simple things
complicated?

1097
01:10:13,614 --> 01:10:15,605
- Enough.
- Corinne.

1098
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,142
Come back.

1099
01:10:18,318 --> 01:10:20,149
Excuse us.

1100
01:10:20,621 --> 01:10:22,384
Please.

1101
01:10:22,956 --> 01:10:24,548
Please.

1102
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,215
We can talk...

1103
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:27,951
Stop it.

1104
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:33,058
Would you please stop this?
Just open the door.

1105
01:10:33,233 --> 01:10:35,326
Open the door.

1106
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:43,142
Can we talk?

1107
01:10:45,946 --> 01:10:47,641
This is so embarrassing.

1108
01:10:47,814 --> 01:10:50,749
- So obdurate.
- What?

1109
01:10:51,485 --> 01:10:53,112
I said that was embarrassing.

1110
01:10:53,286 --> 01:10:56,346
Gabe's teacher was sitting
behind us. You didn't see her?

1111
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,489
No.

1112
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:01,090
I only see you.

1113
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:02,285
Really?

1114
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:05,158
What do you see
when you look at me?

1115
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:06,924
Hm?

1116
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:09,132
The mother of your children?

1117
01:11:09,302 --> 01:11:12,465
A virtuous woman?
Handmaiden of the Lord?

1118
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:15,936
I see a new creature in Christ.

1119
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:17,303
Yeah, right, that's me.

1120
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:20,776
Popped right out of Zeus'
forehead, fully grown.

1121
01:11:21,014 --> 01:11:24,279
- I don't even know what that means.
- No shit, you don't.

1122
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:26,646
Of course. You don't
understand anything.

1123
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:30,551
You don't understand literature
or intelligent conversation

1124
01:11:30,724 --> 01:11:32,123
or how to make love.

1125
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,852
I just do it myself these days,
did you know that?

1126
01:11:35,028 --> 01:11:38,464
It takes me 30 seconds to do
what you couldn't get done

1127
01:11:38,632 --> 01:11:42,534
listening to step-by-step instructions by
Dr. Fuck Barnes talk about...

1128
01:11:42,703 --> 01:11:45,194
You are my wife! Stop it.

1129
01:11:45,372 --> 01:11:47,806
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Let go! Aah!

1130
01:11:47,974 --> 01:11:49,737
- Let go!
- Stop it!

1131
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:52,970
- Just stop! Stop!
- Aah!

1132
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:55,512
I can't breathe.

1133
01:12:01,855 --> 01:12:04,483
Satan, get out of this car.

1134
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:08,822
Out.

1135
01:12:09,896 --> 01:12:11,693
Out.

1136
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,333
Mr. and Mrs. Miller, the
doctor's ready for you now.

1137
01:12:17,504 --> 01:12:19,495
Just follow me.

1138
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,513
- Come on in.
- Hello.

1139
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:30,172
- I'm Dick Adams.
- I'm Corinne.

1140
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:32,841
- Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi.
- Hi, hi, Ethan.

1141
01:12:33,019 --> 01:12:35,579
I'm Dick Adams. You guys
are in Bill's church?

1142
01:12:35,756 --> 01:12:38,190
He has told me that you
have been a backbone

1143
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:40,349
of that congregation
for many years.

1144
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:44,429
Bill discipled me, taught me the word,
I thank God for Bill every day.

1145
01:12:44,598 --> 01:12:47,533
That's great. God bless you.
Do you feel the same way?

1146
01:12:47,768 --> 01:12:50,362
Bill's amazing. Mm.

1147
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:53,563
What, pulls rabbits out of hats?
Gets coins from behind your ear?

1148
01:12:56,409 --> 01:12:59,867
- He's been a blessing.
- I'll be straight with you people.

1149
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:01,946
I consider myself
a prophet of God.

1150
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:04,948
And God is giving me
a word of wisdom right now.

1151
01:13:05,118 --> 01:13:08,451
If you don't mind, I'd like to speak to
your wife by herself, to start with.

1152
01:13:09,322 --> 01:13:13,088
Okay, there's a waiting room out there.
There's coffee, help yourself.

1153
01:13:15,595 --> 01:13:18,928
Well, you know,
I'd prefer to stay if I could.

1154
01:13:19,099 --> 01:13:21,590
Corinne and I don't really have
any secrets from each other.

1155
01:13:21,802 --> 01:13:26,603
Well, maybe yes and maybe no.
God sees things that we do not.

1156
01:13:26,773 --> 01:13:31,233
Bill thinks that Corinne
is in a dark night of the soul.

1157
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:34,244
I don't want her to
go through that alone.

1158
01:13:34,614 --> 01:13:37,014
We have to have pity and fear,

1159
01:13:37,184 --> 01:13:40,483
hating even the garments
soiled with sin.

1160
01:13:41,121 --> 01:13:42,918
Ethan, this isn't going to work.

1161
01:13:43,089 --> 01:13:46,024
- Look, Bill says that...
- No, no, no, she's quite right.

1162
01:13:46,193 --> 01:13:48,627
It's not gonna work
if there's no repentance.

1163
01:13:49,296 --> 01:13:51,628
Is your marriage worth
an hour of your time?

1164
01:13:51,798 --> 01:13:54,528
I know you take your wedding
vows that seriously.

1165
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:59,303
It's fine. It's... It'll be okay.

1166
01:14:01,274 --> 01:14:05,108
She's my sister in the Lord.
I'm gonna treat her with kindness, I promise.

1167
01:14:05,278 --> 01:14:08,543
- It's okay.
- All right, I'll be right outside.

1168
01:14:08,715 --> 01:14:09,943
Great.

1169
01:14:10,116 --> 01:14:11,981
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1170
01:14:23,063 --> 01:14:24,963
Your husband is quite a guy.

1171
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:28,794
He was protecting you just like
the Lord has charged him to do.

1172
01:14:29,302 --> 01:14:32,362
But we are waging
a battle here for your soul.

1173
01:14:32,672 --> 01:14:36,369
We want you in heaven
with him and the kids.

1174
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:38,204
And not outside with the dogs.

1175
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:43,874
Inside with you

1176
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:48,077
or outside with the dogs.

1177
01:14:52,225 --> 01:14:54,022
Why are you here?

1178
01:14:56,162 --> 01:14:58,653
I'm here because...

1179
01:15:01,735 --> 01:15:05,398
I'm here because my husband
of 15 years asked me to come.

1180
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:10,000
There's a fiery lake
waiting for you

1181
01:15:10,343 --> 01:15:12,004
with whips
that'll cut your flesh

1182
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:14,544
and brands
that'll sear your skin.

1183
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:16,941
And do you get to watch?

1184
01:15:18,618 --> 01:15:20,449
This is not a joke, Mrs. Miller.

1185
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,180
You are crucifying Christ
all over again.

1186
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:25,347
I see right into your soul.

1187
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:32,555
A year ago about this time, I stopped
at a McDonald's for an Egg McMuffin.

1188
01:15:33,533 --> 01:15:36,900
And as I was finishing up,
I happened to see a city councilman

1189
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:40,233
whose affair with his secretary
was common knowledge.

1190
01:15:40,407 --> 01:15:42,136
Even his wife knew.

1191
01:15:42,742 --> 01:15:46,405
And I took my last sip of coffee, and
God says to me, "Rebuke him."

1192
01:15:46,579 --> 01:15:48,444
Tell him to repent."

1193
01:15:49,149 --> 01:15:52,209
Now, I did not wanna rebuke
this guy, to be honest.

1194
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:54,717
But God does not
take no for an answer.

1195
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:56,116
So I stand up.

1196
01:15:56,289 --> 01:15:58,780
I walk over there
and I lay it out for him.

1197
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:03,089
I said, "God wants you to repent from
your sin or he will deal with you."

1198
01:16:03,396 --> 01:16:08,060
And that man looked back at me
with eyes as cold as any devil's

1199
01:16:08,468 --> 01:16:10,834
and told me to go fuck myself.

1200
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:16,170
Well, I shrugged.
I'd done what God told me to do.

1201
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:20,246
And I walked out. Later that day,
that city councilman skidded

1202
01:16:20,413 --> 01:16:24,247
on a slick road
over a cliff, dead.

1203
01:16:25,952 --> 01:16:27,783
I look at you

1204
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:31,285
and I'm eating my Egg
McMuffin all over again.

1205
01:16:32,592 --> 01:16:37,154
You are worshipping
at the altar of yourself.

1206
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:49,139
Oh, you gotta sniff this one.

1207
01:16:49,509 --> 01:16:52,376
I love it. Toni Morrison.

1208
01:16:52,545 --> 01:16:55,480
- Morrison? I don't know Morrison.
- Yeah. Fantastic.

1209
01:16:55,648 --> 01:16:58,617
- Is it good? Mm.
- Oh, yeah.

1210
01:16:58,985 --> 01:17:00,816
I ca... Do I know you?

1211
01:17:00,987 --> 01:17:03,478
Uh, what's your zip code?

1212
01:17:04,357 --> 01:17:05,984
It's 12408.

1213
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:08,787
Yeah, well,
I'm your mail carrier.

1214
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:10,020
My mail what?

1215
01:17:10,196 --> 01:17:12,790
Mailman. In America,
you call it your mailman.

1216
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:14,194
- Yeah.
- Yes, of course.

1217
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:17,996
Yes, of course, I just didn't
recognize you without your...

1218
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:20,799
My stuff. Yeah, well...

1219
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:24,171
If I was smoother, I'd pretend
I didn't recognize you either.

1220
01:17:24,344 --> 01:17:26,574
But I have to admit, I have.

1221
01:17:26,746 --> 01:17:29,647
Yes, now I remember,
you come very early.

1222
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:31,909
The word is out, alas.

1223
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:35,383
No, your route in the morning, that
you deliver my mail very early.

1224
01:17:35,555 --> 01:17:37,420
- Oh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1225
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:39,387
Come on, I'm pulling your leg.

1226
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:47,730
Thank you very much, that's lovely.
I'll give it a peruse. Thank you.

1227
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:51,837
You're welcome,
okay. Um, bye.

1228
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:53,233
- See you.
- Yeah.

1229
01:18:03,116 --> 01:18:07,416
<i># The sweetest name I know #</i>

1230

01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:00,904
Praise God, Jesus,
the sweetest name I know.

1241
01:19:01,074 --> 01:19:04,271
Uh, before we go, what can we pray
for tonight as a house church?

1242
01:19:04,444 --> 01:19:07,072
Anybody have a burden on their
heart that they wanna share?

1243
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:10,742
You've carried it long enough.

1244
01:19:11,618 --> 01:19:13,245
Anybody?

1245
01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:19,453
God is revealing to me how
much I'm walking in the flesh.

1246
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:24,029
I really lost it
a couple weeks ago

1247
01:19:25,365 --> 01:19:29,096
and I know that Satan
can't possess a believer,

1248
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:32,097
but I was out of control.

1249
01:19:34,841 --> 01:19:37,674
And I really need his spirit
to fill me up.

1250
01:19:38,945 --> 01:19:44,281
A broken and contrite heart, O God,
thou will not despise me for.

1251
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:47,942
We'll intercede for you, brother.
Thank you. Anybody else?

1252
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:51,116
Anybody?

1253
01:19:51,457 --> 01:19:53,448
Please pray
for Luke and for me.

1254
01:19:55,228 --> 01:19:57,287
We can't get pregnant.

1255
01:19:58,898 --> 01:20:03,665
We wanna raise a son or a daughter for
the kingdom, but God is saying no.

1256
01:20:04,337 --> 01:20:07,795
Uh, it's hard to, um,

1257
01:20:07,974 --> 01:20:11,307
ahem, say not our will,

1258
01:20:11,477 --> 01:20:13,570
but thy will be done.

1259
01:20:13,746 --> 01:20:18,740
Jesus in the garden,
sweating blood,

1260
01:20:19,852 --> 01:20:23,879
begging, begging the Father
God to save his life,

1261
01:20:24,057 --> 01:20:28,721
and that is the same Jesus
that intercedes for us.

1262
01:20:29,095 --> 01:20:31,325
That's the same Jesus
that says:

1263
01:20:31,497 --> 01:20:34,489
"Come to me, you who are
weary and heavyhearted,

1264
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:36,726
I will take your burden
from you."

1265
01:20:36,903 --> 01:20:40,339
Jesus is asking us
to come to him tonight.

1266
01:20:41,107 --> 01:20:44,235
Everyone in this room tonight,
I bring to the throne of God.

1267
01:20:45,678 --> 01:20:50,047
I ask his tender mercies upon you
and his gentle watch-care.

1268
01:20:51,217 --> 01:20:55,051
I ask his angels to watch
your comings and your goings.

1269
01:20:55,221 --> 01:20:57,746
May you reside in the
shadow of his wings.

1270
01:20:57,924 --> 01:20:59,516
Amen? Amen.

1271
01:21:00,893 --> 01:21:02,690
Lord, help me.

1272
01:21:03,429 --> 01:21:06,956
Because I can't feel you.
I feel nothing.

1273
01:21:09,702 --> 01:21:12,102
Draw near to me, Lord.
Come on.

1274
01:21:12,272 --> 01:21:14,297
Where are you?

1275
01:21:14,641 --> 01:21:16,802
Huh? Where are you?

1276
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:29,083
<i># Cast me not away #</i>

1277
01:21:29,255 --> 01:21:33,214
I'm gonna do this
unless you stop me.

1278
01:21:35,428 --> 01:21:38,261
<i># Take not thy Holy Spirit #</i>

1279
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:48,598
<i># Restore unto me #</i>

1280
01:21:49,475 --> 01:21:51,739
You should just stay home
next time.

1281
01:21:51,911 --> 01:21:54,277
You obviously
don't wanna be there.

1282
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:00,783
<i># Renew a right spirit within me ##</i>

1283
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:06,688
You're leaving me, aren't you?

1284
01:22:21,607 --> 01:22:23,768
You sure about this?

1285
01:22:24,644 --> 01:22:26,009
No.

1286
01:22:27,947 --> 01:22:31,508
Are you still gonna come
and hear us sing at church?

1287
01:22:32,985 --> 01:22:35,180
I said I would, didn't I?

1288
01:22:35,455 --> 01:22:38,219
You said a lot of things
you didn't mean, Corinne.

1289
01:22:40,493 --> 01:22:45,988
<i># My hope is built on
Nothing less #</i>

1290
01:22:46,165 --> 01:22:47,996
<i># Than Jesus' name and ##</i>

1291
01:22:49,369 --> 01:22:51,337
Fuck you, goddamn it.

1292
01:22:57,877 --> 01:22:59,469
Hello again.

1293
01:22:59,645 --> 01:23:02,079
My lucky day, huh?
Running into you again.

1294
01:23:02,248 --> 01:23:05,046
Checked out a lovely
new collection of Philip Larkin.

1295
01:23:05,218 --> 01:23:07,209
- Who's that?
- Some son of a bitch

1296
01:23:07,387 --> 01:23:08,820
who likes schoolgirls.

1297
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:11,320
But he's a poet
who'll break your heart.

1298
01:23:11,991 --> 01:23:14,255
You know, it doesn't
seem possible, does it?

1299
01:23:14,427 --> 01:23:17,919
People who are perverts
but have the tongue of angels.

1300
01:23:18,097 --> 01:23:20,327
You know, that's
in First Corinthians. Um...

1301
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,162
Though I have the tongue
of angels and have not

1302
01:23:23,336 --> 01:23:25,031
- Love.
- love. Yeah.

1303
01:23:25,204 --> 01:23:26,569
Do you know the Bible?

1304
01:23:27,673 --> 01:23:31,666
If a man knows Shakespeare,
the Bible, something about art,

1305
01:23:31,844 --> 01:23:33,573
a man is educated,

1306
01:23:33,746 --> 01:23:35,714
- as they say.
- Heh.

1307
01:23:35,882 --> 01:23:38,350
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Dublin, Ireland.

1308
01:23:38,518 --> 01:23:40,418
- Oh.
- I've been here 20 years.

1309
01:23:40,586 --> 01:23:41,610
- Twenty years?
- Yes, 20...

1310
01:23:41,788 --> 01:23:43,221
Shh!

1311
01:23:43,389 --> 01:23:45,357
Twenty years. Shh.

1312
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:47,925
Why is your accent so thick?

1313
01:23:48,094 --> 01:23:50,358
- Is it that thick?
- Ha-ha-ha.

1314
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:52,361
I thought it'd gone.

1315
01:23:52,532 --> 01:23:54,022
I thought I sounded American.

1316
01:23:56,702 --> 01:23:59,068
- I'm Corinne Miller.
- I'm Liam Donovan.

1317
01:23:59,238 --> 01:24:01,433
- It's really nice to meet you.
- You too.

1318
01:24:01,874 --> 01:24:04,604
So, listen, we must
talk more about books.

1319
01:24:04,777 --> 01:24:06,574
Oh, yeah, I'd like to.
Sure.

1320
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:11,748
And I'll tell you what I learned in
a long walkabout with an aborigine

1321
01:24:11,918 --> 01:24:14,944
- out in the outback.
- Mm.

1322
01:24:15,154 --> 01:24:17,384
- Ominous.
- Mm. Heh.

1323
01:24:17,557 --> 01:24:18,546
See you.

1324
01:24:39,445 --> 01:24:41,811
- Hello.
- Hi.

1325
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:44,950
The pearl accordion
with the gold keys, uh...

1326
01:24:45,117 --> 01:24:47,244
- In the window?
- Can I take a look at it?

1327
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,116
- Sure. Do you play?
- If the price is right.

1328
01:25:03,135 --> 01:25:04,159
Oh...

1329
01:25:04,337 --> 01:25:06,828
- It's a big accordion.
- Let's see.

1330
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:09,599
- You want to put it right on?
- It's just... Yeah.

1331
01:25:15,815 --> 01:25:17,476
Ooh.

1332
01:25:17,783 --> 01:25:20,183
I don't think I know that song.

1333
01:25:21,554 --> 01:25:23,954
Nice heavy curtains.

1334
01:25:24,123 --> 01:25:27,286
This will keep anyone
from peeping in at you.

1335
01:25:28,661 --> 01:25:30,288
They're just ugly.

1336
01:25:32,665 --> 01:25:36,999
You're a single woman now, Corinne.
You need to start being careful.

1337
01:25:37,303 --> 01:25:40,636
Start being careful?
When have I ever not been careful?

1338
01:25:42,341 --> 01:25:43,638
Besides now?

1339
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:47,809
- Oh! Goodness sake.
- You know, Ma, leave them.

1340
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,379
Leave them. I love the light.

1341
01:25:49,549 --> 01:25:51,676
- Shades will suffice. It's fine.
- It's dangerous.

1342
01:25:53,085 --> 01:25:54,643
- Hi there. Um...
- Hi.

1343
01:25:55,721 --> 01:26:00,181
I'm Faye Colbert, and I just wanted
to welcome you to the house.

1344
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:01,485
Oh, thank you.

1345
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:04,824
Extra doughnuts nobody ate at
the Speedee Lube this morning.

1346
01:26:04,997 --> 01:26:09,093
- I just hate to see them go to waste.
- Thank you. Aw...

1347
01:26:09,702 --> 01:26:12,102
Also, I wanted to give you
a heads-up.

1348
01:26:12,271 --> 01:26:16,173
This floor is full of
a lot of religious nuts.

1349
01:26:16,342 --> 01:26:18,276
They'll come
ringing your doorbell

1350
01:26:18,444 --> 01:26:21,208
with all their assorted
Watchtowers and the like.

1351
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,439
You let a Jehovah's
Witness in once

1352
01:26:23,616 --> 01:26:25,880
and they will come back
again and again.

1353
01:26:26,052 --> 01:26:27,349
Well, they have a, uh...

1354
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,614
They have a quota they
have to make every month.

1355
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:32,724
They... And they
hound you to death.

1356
01:26:32,892 --> 01:26:35,417
We had two Mormons

1357
01:26:35,595 --> 01:26:39,588
knocking on doors
last month too.

1358
01:26:39,765 --> 01:26:43,701
They were nice-looking guys.
They had the dress shirt, tie.

1359
01:26:43,869 --> 01:26:47,600
Creepy though.
Smiling to beat the band.

1360
01:26:47,773 --> 01:26:50,708
They're false prophets.
Sign of the end of times,

1361
01:26:50,876 --> 01:26:53,640
that's what my pastor says.
That, and earthquakes.

1362
01:26:53,813 --> 01:26:56,646
And it's no coincidence
that all the earthquakes

1363
01:26:56,816 --> 01:26:59,649
happen in California,
what with San Francisco and...

1364
01:26:59,819 --> 01:27:03,220
- The kind of people who live up there.
- The Mexicans?

1365
01:27:03,389 --> 01:27:04,981
Well, those too, of course.

1366
01:27:05,157 --> 01:27:08,058
They're Catholic, they breed
like there's no tomorrow.

1367
01:27:08,227 --> 01:27:13,062
Listen, I just told Corinne you have
got to put a chain on that front door.

1368
01:27:13,232 --> 01:27:15,826
Do not neglect
welcoming of strangers.

1369
01:27:16,002 --> 01:27:18,630
You might be entertaining
angels unaware.

1370
01:27:18,804 --> 01:27:22,638
More likely Charles Manson,
darling, than an angel.

1371
01:27:24,243 --> 01:27:25,574
Ned, it's Corinne.

1372
01:27:25,745 --> 01:27:28,578
Can you hold up the phone
for Annika?

1373
01:27:29,081 --> 01:27:30,514
Thanks.

1374
01:27:33,486 --> 01:27:35,511
Nika, it's Corinne.

1375
01:27:35,688 --> 01:27:37,451
Listen to this.

1376
01:28:03,616 --> 01:28:05,106
Nika?

1377
01:28:06,886 --> 01:28:08,353
Nika?

1378
01:28:22,835 --> 01:28:24,200
Hi.

1379
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,004
Hi.

1380
01:28:31,177 --> 01:28:32,474
What's this?

1381
01:28:32,645 --> 01:28:35,842
It's Daniel in the lions' den.

1382
01:28:36,015 --> 01:28:38,745
Ooh, it is.
Gosh, this is wild.

1383
01:28:38,918 --> 01:28:40,545
They said I did it wrong.

1384
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,153
Why?

1385
01:28:42,321 --> 01:28:46,257
Because there's no TVs and
remote controls in Bible days.

1386
01:28:46,425 --> 01:28:51,522
Well, you know what?
I think you have an extraordinary imagination.

1387
01:28:51,731 --> 01:28:54,097
I think you have
a very large imagination.

1388
01:28:54,266 --> 01:28:57,997
And I think that
my son is an artist.

1389
01:28:59,605 --> 01:29:02,506
My son is an artist, okay?

1390
01:29:02,675 --> 01:29:05,235
I'm gonna take you somewhere
special today, okay?

1391
01:29:05,411 --> 01:29:07,845
Will you hold that
so it doesn't get wrinkled?

1392
01:29:11,617 --> 01:29:13,084
I think it's wonderful.

1393
01:29:13,419 --> 01:29:15,387
Look, she's naked.

1394
01:29:15,554 --> 01:29:17,545
She's definitely
not wearing clothes.

1395
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:19,552
There's a tube by her

1396
01:29:19,725 --> 01:29:22,717
- and it looks like...
- She looks frightened.

1397
01:29:22,895 --> 01:29:24,863
I don't see
their mama anywhere.

1398
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:26,793
No.

1399
01:29:26,966 --> 01:29:28,524
They do look scared.

1400
01:29:28,701 --> 01:29:30,931
I think that's why
they're scared.

1401
01:29:31,103 --> 01:29:33,037
- Because their mama is gone?
- Yeah.

1402
01:29:33,739 --> 01:29:37,266
- Oh, look, what's in it?
- There's pink stripes and stuff.

1403
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:40,875
How could they
catch a jaguar's, um...

1404
01:29:41,714 --> 01:29:43,409
hair?

1405
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:46,448
It's so tall.

1406
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:49,278
Ooh.

1407
01:29:51,056 --> 01:29:54,389
If you look very closely,
there's webs in the...

1408
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,619
In the end of the arrow.

1409
01:29:56,796 --> 01:29:57,820
Look at her.

1410
01:29:57,997 --> 01:30:00,727
Gosh, the human body
is so beautiful, isn't it?

1411
01:30:02,501 --> 01:30:03,900
Whoa.

1412
01:30:04,069 --> 01:30:06,629
This lady is so voluptuous.

1413
01:30:06,806 --> 01:30:09,240
- She better go to Weight Watchers.
- Yeah.

1414
01:30:11,477 --> 01:30:13,138
Yeah, she's a big old target.

1415
01:30:13,312 --> 01:30:16,247
Smaller than a giant
but bigger than a human.

1416
01:30:16,582 --> 01:30:18,482
Hey, how are you?

1417
01:30:18,651 --> 01:30:20,585
Didn't expect to see you here.

1418
01:30:20,753 --> 01:30:23,313
I've been delivering your mail
to another address.

1419
01:30:24,824 --> 01:30:28,817
- Sorry if I'm speaking out of turn.
- I plant these rows every spring.

1420
01:30:28,994 --> 01:30:31,485
I think the kids would be so
sad if they weren't here.

1421
01:30:33,499 --> 01:30:35,933
- You deliver my mail this morning?
- I did.

1422
01:30:36,101 --> 01:30:39,764
It was only bills, I think.
But I did knock on your door

1423
01:30:39,939 --> 01:30:43,807
because I brought you this.

1424
01:30:46,946 --> 01:30:50,313
<i>The Collected Poems
of W.B. Yeats.</i>

1425
01:30:52,685 --> 01:30:54,846
- Are you loaning this?
- I am. Yeah.

1426
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,614
- Okay.
- I'm only asking one small favor.

1427
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:58,814
Uh-oh.

1428
01:30:58,991 --> 01:31:00,959
Just indulge me.

1429
01:31:01,126 --> 01:31:03,492
- Let me read one aloud.
- What, now?

1430
01:31:03,662 --> 01:31:06,790
Yes, now. You wouldn't be
the first one I've read to today.

1431
01:31:06,966 --> 01:31:08,627
There's an 82-year-old lady

1432
01:31:08,801 --> 01:31:11,998
who receives nothing but
junk mail and my daily poem.

1433
01:31:13,205 --> 01:31:14,729
That's lovely.

1434
01:31:17,843 --> 01:31:21,335
Yeah, okay. Heh.

1435
01:31:27,019 --> 01:31:30,819
<i>Never give all the heart, for love</i>

1436
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:34,551
<i>Will hardly seem worth thinking of
To passionate women if it seem</i>

1437
01:31:34,727 --> 01:31:38,322
<i>Certain, and they never dream</i>

1438
01:31:38,497 --> 01:31:41,330
<i>That it fades out from kiss to kiss</i>

1439
01:31:42,067 --> 01:31:44,501
<i>For everything that's lovely is</i>

1440
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:49,073
<i>But a brief, dreamy, kind delight</i>

1441
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:53,838
<i>O never give the heart outright</i>

1442
01:31:54,747 --> 01:31:57,773
- That's Yeats?
- It is.

1443
01:31:58,884 --> 01:32:02,718
You have the look of a woman
who gives all her heart.

1444
01:32:03,856 --> 01:32:06,347
It's hard to give less,
you know.

1445
01:32:07,259 --> 01:32:12,196
Mm. I hope you've planted some of these
flowers where you can see them too.

1446
01:32:19,939 --> 01:32:21,930
Here we go.

1447
01:32:22,107 --> 01:32:24,234
I want Mommy
to have the first piece.

1448
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:25,536
No, silly.

1449
01:32:25,711 --> 01:32:28,942
- The birthday boy gets the first piece.
- Make a wish, darling.

1450
01:32:29,114 --> 01:32:33,073
I want you to give each other bites
like in your wedding picture.

1451
01:32:33,652 --> 01:32:36,314
Well, wedding cake isn't
the same as birthday cake.

1452
01:32:36,488 --> 01:32:40,584
I'll tell you what, you can help me
cut my cake next time I get married.

1453
01:32:40,759 --> 01:32:42,727
- How's that sound? Yeah?
- Good.

1454
01:32:42,895 --> 01:32:45,455
- Don't hold your breath there, Gabe.
- Hold your breath, Gabe.

1455
01:32:46,832 --> 01:32:49,062
Didn't you bake
their wedding cake too?

1456
01:32:49,234 --> 01:32:50,895
God, that was a delicious cake.

1457
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:53,129
- It was yummy, Mama.
- Yeah.

1458
01:32:53,305 --> 01:32:55,296
- Nobody bakes like you.
- Yeah.

1459
01:32:55,474 --> 01:32:57,567
- She put 20 pounds on me.
- Heh, heh.

1460
01:32:57,743 --> 01:32:59,574
I would have guessed closer to 40.

1461
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:03,071
Why would you
guess closer to 40?

1462
01:33:03,248 --> 01:33:05,910
- Because he's fat.
- Daddy. Stop.

1463
01:33:06,085 --> 01:33:08,610
Oh. Come on, I'm kidding.
I'm half-kidding.

1464
01:33:08,787 --> 01:33:11,449
I was kidding, pretty much.

1465
01:33:11,623 --> 01:33:13,454
Guys get big, some guys.

1466
01:33:14,126 --> 01:33:16,959
I got the same waist size
as high school.

1467
01:33:17,129 --> 01:33:19,120
- Daddy.
- Mom, Dad,

1468
01:33:19,298 --> 01:33:22,995
can I take your picture together?
Like in the wedding photo?

1469
01:33:23,769 --> 01:33:26,431
I wanna take the picture.

1470
01:33:26,605 --> 01:33:28,095
Can I take it please, Mama?

1471
01:33:28,273 --> 01:33:30,673
He's the birthday boy,
give him the camera.

1472
01:33:30,843 --> 01:33:34,142
If it makes you happy...
Ethan, let's do the reenactment.

1473
01:33:34,313 --> 01:33:36,042
- Come here, big boy.
- Reenactment.

1474
01:33:36,215 --> 01:33:38,843
Okay, okay, okay.

1475
01:33:39,785 --> 01:33:41,548
You got that camera ready?

1476
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,278
Oh...

1477
01:33:43,455 --> 01:33:45,616
You got it in focus?

1478
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:47,190
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

1479
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:50,157
Just like that?
Just like that.

1480
01:33:50,329 --> 01:33:53,856
Now if I remember correctly,

1481
01:33:54,033 --> 01:33:57,696
this is the part where your Mama
looked at me with her big blues.

1482
01:33:57,870 --> 01:34:01,033
And I smeared the cake
in her face.

1483
01:34:01,206 --> 01:34:02,696
- No, you didn't.
- I didn't?

1484
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:05,844
- I'm gonna take a picture.
And fire!

1485
01:34:06,011 --> 01:34:09,572
- Don't you dare. Don't you dare.
- Ready to take a picture.

1486
01:34:12,651 --> 01:34:14,676
- Got the camera ready?
- Yeah.

1487
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:20,586
I took... I took the picture.

1488
01:34:20,759 --> 01:34:23,353
Oh, no.

1489
01:34:25,864 --> 01:34:28,332
<i>Kiss, kiss, kiss.</i>

1490
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:37,738
<i>Kiss, kiss, kiss.</i>

1491
01:34:39,344 --> 01:34:51,347
<i>Kiss, kiss, kiss.</i>

1492
01:34:51,523 --> 01:34:53,753
I thought you'd smash it
on her face.

1493
01:34:54,226 --> 01:34:58,128
- I'm gonna smash it on your face.
- Pick it up. Excuse me.

1494
01:34:58,297 --> 01:35:00,697
Yeah. I'm gonna
smash it on your face.

1495
01:35:00,866 --> 01:35:02,197
Did you turn into an ornery boy

1496
01:35:02,367 --> 01:35:04,198
now that you're 7 years old?

1497
01:35:04,369 --> 01:35:06,269
- No!
- Yes!

1498
01:35:06,438 --> 01:35:09,134
This is your big birthday bite.

1499
01:35:09,308 --> 01:35:10,605
Here it is.

1500
01:35:10,809 --> 01:35:12,936
Uh-oh. Hello, Gabe.

1501
01:35:13,112 --> 01:35:15,046
Aah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1502
01:35:16,115 --> 01:35:18,310
Gabe, Gabe, Gabe.

1503
01:35:18,484 --> 01:35:20,611
Okay. I won't.

1504
01:35:21,286 --> 01:35:22,753
I won't. Ha, ha.

1505
01:35:22,921 --> 01:35:24,218
Happy birthday, my angel.

1506
01:35:27,059 --> 01:35:30,620
- Anybody take a picture of me?
- Happy birthday.

1507
01:35:30,996 --> 01:35:34,090
Kathleen, did you bring
ice cream for the cake?

1508
01:35:36,435 --> 01:35:38,164
I thought you'd really do it.

1509
01:35:38,337 --> 01:35:40,100
Coming right up.

1510
01:35:45,911 --> 01:35:50,348
"They flew over the Charles River.
'Better,' quacked Mr. Mallard."

1511
01:35:50,516 --> 01:35:54,748
'That island looks like a nice place,
a little way from the Public Garden.'

1512
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:59,584
'I like this place,' said Mrs. Mallard,
as they climbed and waddled along.

1513
01:35:59,758 --> 01:36:03,922
'Why don't we build a nest and raise
our ducklings right in this pond?

1514
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:07,793
There are no foxes, no turtles,
and the people feed us peanuts.

1515
01:36:07,966 --> 01:36:10,992
What could be better?'
'Good,' said Mr. Mallard,

1516
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:15,334
delighted that at last, Mrs. Mallard
had found a place that suited her.

1517
01:36:15,674 --> 01:36:19,610
'Look out,' squawked Mrs. Mallard,
all in a dither.

1518
01:36:19,778 --> 01:36:21,109
'You'll get run over.'

1519
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,046
When she got her breath back, she
added, 'This is no place for babies,

1520
01:36:25,217 --> 01:36:27,811
with all these horrid things
rushing about.

1521
01:36:27,986 --> 01:36:29,613
We better look someplace else.'

1522
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:35,348
So they flew over Beacon Hill
and round the State House,

1523
01:36:35,527 --> 01:36:37,654
"but there was no place there."

1524
01:36:38,063 --> 01:36:40,122
Looking for a place to live.

1525
01:36:40,632 --> 01:36:44,864
"They looked in Louisburg Square.
There was no water to swim in."

1526
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:54,044
<i># I need thee every hour #</i>

1527

01:37:38,457 --> 01:37:39,754

01:37:39,925 --> 01:37:44,419
<i># Oh, bless me now, my savior #</i>

1535

1548
01:39:21,226 --> 01:39:27,790

1549
01:39:28,867 --> 01:39:32,496

1555
01:40:08,373 --> 01:40:12,241
My children have the voices
of angels, don't they?

1556
01:40:14,179 --> 01:40:16,374
Do I hear an amen?

1557
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,115
He walks with me
and he talks with me

1558
01:40:22,287 --> 01:40:24,915
and he tells me I am his own.

1559
01:40:25,624 --> 01:40:28,525
What more could
anyone want, right?

1560
01:40:30,429 --> 01:40:32,727
Taking a stroll with God
in the garden.

1561
01:40:32,898 --> 01:40:34,729
Having a chat with the creator.

1562
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:37,562
Asking him questions
and getting the answers.

1563
01:40:37,736 --> 01:40:43,038
I mean, you couldn't be
any more safe or secure.

1564
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:45,199
There's no higher ground.

1565
01:40:46,711 --> 01:40:49,305
Call upon the name of the Lord
and you will be saved.

1566
01:40:50,415 --> 01:40:51,882
We call him so many things.

1567
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:56,111
We call him, uh, El Shaddai.

1568
01:40:56,288 --> 01:40:59,883
Lord. Father God.
Jesus. Holy Spirit.

1569
01:41:00,058 --> 01:41:04,552
Heavenly Father.
Adonai. Jehovah-jireh.

1570
01:41:04,963 --> 01:41:07,727
The ancient Hebrew alphabet
contained no vowels

1571
01:41:07,899 --> 01:41:11,733
so God's name was rendered
only in consonants.

1572
01:41:13,271 --> 01:41:17,002
And the vowels
had to be provided orally

1573
01:41:17,175 --> 01:41:19,336
when a word was spoken.

1574
01:41:19,511 --> 01:41:22,674
But the rabbis didn't wanna
use God's name in vain,

1575
01:41:22,848 --> 01:41:25,476
so his name was never spoken.

1576
01:41:27,252 --> 01:41:33,350
So all we're really left with
is just this string of consonants,

1577
01:41:33,525 --> 01:41:35,857
you know, an unspeakable name.

1578
01:41:36,094 --> 01:41:37,652
Bill, just one...

1579
01:41:37,829 --> 01:41:40,662
Just a minute, pastor,
please, just one.

1580
01:41:43,368 --> 01:41:46,303
You know, when I was
a little girl, my pastor told me

1581
01:41:46,471 --> 01:41:50,134
that Jesus was knocking
on the door of my heart.

1582
01:41:50,308 --> 01:41:56,269
And so I listened real hard,
and I thought I heard him.

1583
01:41:56,448 --> 01:41:59,975
I did. I raised my hand
and I told everyone

1584
01:42:00,151 --> 01:42:04,815
that Jesus was standing there,
and he wanted me.

1585
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:06,855
He wanted me.

1586
01:42:08,193 --> 01:42:10,127
Tap, tap, tap.

1587
01:42:10,662 --> 01:42:12,220
Tap, tap, tap.

1588
01:42:12,397 --> 01:42:14,797
So I invited him in.

1589
01:42:15,133 --> 01:42:19,900
"Welcome," I said,
and I gave my heart outright.

1590
01:42:20,972 --> 01:42:24,703
And I'm standing here today,
and I'm telling you,

1591
01:42:24,876 --> 01:42:26,503
I'm telling you today

1592
01:42:26,678 --> 01:42:30,512
that I'm still waiting for him
to make himself at home.

1593
01:42:30,682 --> 01:42:33,048
You know, I call and I call.

1594
01:42:33,385 --> 01:42:36,821
And there have been times
where I know he answered me.

1595
01:42:36,988 --> 01:42:40,856
I'm... Times where I'm sure of it.

1596
01:42:41,026 --> 01:42:43,324
But other times,

1597
01:42:43,662 --> 01:42:47,689
I've got the porch light on,
and he doesn't come.

1598
01:42:50,068 --> 01:42:53,697
And I feel like I live
in an empty place.

1599
01:42:56,441 --> 01:42:57,931
And I told God, I told him:

1600
01:42:58,109 --> 01:43:02,842
"You know what?
I'm not gonna let go."

1601
01:43:03,014 --> 01:43:07,348
I won't let go
until he blesses me.

1602
01:43:07,519 --> 01:43:10,044
But I'm wrestling something
nameless, you know,

1603
01:43:10,221 --> 01:43:11,882
without form and void.

1604
01:43:12,057 --> 01:43:17,120
And I just want it
to be solid so bad.

1605
01:43:18,196 --> 01:43:23,793
I need all of this to be real, and I don't
always know how to make it real.

1606
01:43:23,969 --> 01:43:27,735
I don't know how to make
it real, so I am...

1607
01:43:29,407 --> 01:43:31,238
Forgive me.

1608
01:43:32,277 --> 01:43:33,972
Okay?

1609
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:39,372
I admire your faith.
I admire your faith, I really do.

1610
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:42,543
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Corinne.

1611
01:43:42,721 --> 01:43:45,554
