1
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:54,934
Birju.

2
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:57,009
Uncle.

3
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,286
Greetings, Brother Birju.

4
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:02,484
Birju, you've become such a wealthy man. . .

5
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:03,644
. . . but you still haven't changed a bit.

6
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:06,203
Aunt, whatever this kite-seller, Birju is today. . .

7
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:07,444
. . . it's because of your blessings.

8
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:10,254
But brother, where is our birthday boy? - Yes.

9
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:11,814
He was here right now.

10
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:13,363
Look. There he is.

11
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:17,604
Brother.

12
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:22,653
God bless you, my brother. May you live a long life.

13
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:26,244
I wish our parents were alive today.

14
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:27,814
They'd be so happy.

15
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:32,085
Brother, I've never seen our parents.

16
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:36,926
But every time you bless me. . .

17
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,570
. . .I feel their presence around myself.

18
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:49,843
See, Uncle. Till sometime ago, I used to carry him in my arms. . .

19
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:54,326
. . .and today, he speaks such wise words.

20
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:58,606
Come on. Let's go and cut the cake.

21
00:03:58,695 --> 00:03:59,764
Brother, Madhu.

22
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:02,892
Of course. You won't cut the cake without Madhu.

23
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,203
Raja.

24
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,323
Hi.

25
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:09,327
Happy birthday, Raja. - Thank you.

26
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,007
Heartiest greetings on your brother's birthday, Brijnath.

27
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:12,972
Wow, king and queen? - Yes.

28
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:14,204
This is you and this is me.

29
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,523
You're the Raja ( king ), and I'm the Rani ( queen ).

30
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:18,175
I'm Raja all right, but you're Madhu.

31
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,094
Yes, that's right.

32
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:21,369
Come with me.

33
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,129
Brother, when his name is Raja then why isn't my name, Rani?

34
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,804
Yes, it should have been so.

35
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:33,167
Fine, now we'll call you Rani.

36
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:35,485
Thank you, sister-in-law. Come on, Raja.

37
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,332
What are you thinking, Brijnath?

38
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:44,084
No, I was thinking. . . - I get it.

39
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:47,488
Why don't we convert our friendship into an alliance?

40
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:52,690
To tell you the truth, that's just what I was thinking !

41
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,493
Please accept this ring as an auspicious token.

42
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:00,893
That means, we're now relatives.

43
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:07,173
Sir, there's a call for you. - Yes, just a minute.

44
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,849
Yes, this is Brijnath here.

45
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:10,846
Sir, our factory is on fire. - What?

46
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,130
No.

47
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,885
Help! Fire!

48
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:43,211
Don't cry, Raja. Everything will be fine.

49
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:48,893
Look, Rana.

50
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:52,887
It's all over.

51
00:05:55,655 --> 00:06:01,173
There's no way I can compensate for this loss.

52
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:08,365
I knew it, Rana there's only one man. . .

53
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:12,334
. . .who'd come to my aid at such a time.

54
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:15,448
If my aid could change your destiny. . .

55
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:17,366
. . .I'd have surely done that.

56
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:20,488
But that doesn't happen.

57
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:23,767
I've come to return this ring.

58
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:25,208
This alliance is not possible now.

59
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:28,284
What are you doing? - Be quiet.

60
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,971
I know what I'm doing.

61
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:34,809
He no longer matches us in stature now. He's ruined.

62
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:40,045
Mr. Rana, were we friends. . .

63
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:42,366
. . .only because of our stature? - Yes.

64
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:43,524
And now that you've lost that stature. .

65
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:45,173
. .we can no longer be friends. . .

66
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,848
. . .and when we are no longer friends. . .

67
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:48,806
. . .this alliance can't happen either.

68
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:51,128
Here's your ring.

69
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:57,247
Let's go, Madhu. - No brother, I want to be with Raja.

70
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:58,563
Forget Raja. Come with me.

71
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:00,008
Raja. - Come on.

72
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:01,570
No. - Come on.

73
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,725
No, I won't leave Raja. - Come on.

74
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:05,533
Raja. - Where are you going?

75
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:07,173
Come on. - Raja.

76
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:08,963
Raja.

77
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:10,409
Madhu.

78
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:12,368
Raja. Raja, stop.

79
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:13,854
Madhu. - Raja.

80
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,493
Madhu. - What are you doing?

81
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:17,293
Madhu. - Raja, stop.

82
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,694
Madhu. - Raja.

83
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,049
Madhu. - Raja.

84
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:22,251
I want to be with Raja.

85
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:24,007
Raja. - Madhu.

86
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:53,326
Raja. - Aunt, is brother Birju okay?

87
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:58,528
Why are you quiet? Tell me, is he okay?

88
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:03,085
For God's sake, tell me how is my brother.

89
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:08,087
No. No.

90
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:10,487
Brother Birju.

91
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,813
Brother Birju.

92
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:17,811
Brother. - I can't join it back.

93
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:21,171
I can't join it back.

94
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:26,291
My toy is broken.

95
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:29,932
I can't join it back.

96
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:34,329
I can't join it back. . . - Brother.

97
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:43,333
My toy is broken.

98
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:46,366
I can't join it back.

99
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:48,973
I can't join it back.

100
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:52,727
I can't join it back.

101
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:57,528
I can't join it back.

102
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:02,851
I can't join it back. I can't join it back.

103
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:06,568
I can't join it back.

104
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:08,807
I can't join it back.

105
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,373
I can't join it back.

106
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,129
Brother.

107
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:29,127
Brother Birju. Brother Birju, what's wrong with you?

108
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,012
Brother Birju, what's wrong with you?

109
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,484
Brother Birju, what's wrong with you?

110
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
Brother Birju. Brother Birju.

111
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:39,814
Brother Birju.

112
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:53,769
What's wrong with Birju?

113
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:54,970
Birju.

114
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:58,284
Put him on the bed, quickly. Quickly. - Yes sir.

115
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:00,450
Careful.

116
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:04,123
Sister, call the mental asylum quickly.

117
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:14,170
Aunt, tell the doctor not to send my brother to the asylum.

118
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:17,488
He can't live without me, Aunt.

119
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:19,328
He can't live without me.

120
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:23,044
Raja, they must to take him to the mental asylum.

121
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:25,007
It's for his own benefit.

122
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:28,252
And son, if he sees you crying. . .

123
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:30,726
. . . it'll be difficult to take him along.

124
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:32,408
Wipe your tears, son.

125
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:38,245
Son, I can understand your agony. . .

126
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:40,971
. . . but you must get a grip of yourself, son.

127
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,125
I want to go see Raja.

128
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,286
I want to go see Raja.

129
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,730
Look son, they are bringing him.

130
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:49,607
Please, be quiet.

131
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:56,684
Brother.

132
00:11:56,975 --> 00:12:00,012
Raja. Where are they taking me?

133
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:02,968
Brother, they are taking you to a better hospital.

134
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:05,047
There'll be better doctors there.

135
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:07,126
They'll treat you better.

136
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:11,044
Once you're cured, I'll take you back home. That's it.

137
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,885
I'll come back home soon, won't I?

138
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,488
No, I won't go anywhere without you.

139
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,293
I'm coming along with you. - No.

140
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:24,573
Go sit in the car, I'll get your luggage and your medicine. Okay?

141
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:29,605
Do come. I'll wait for you in the car. - Okay.

142
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:32,414
Let's go. Take me to the better hospital.

143
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,571
I want to be cured. I have to go home soon.

144
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,727
My brother is all alone.

145
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:55,173
Why did you close the door?

146
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:58,850
Doctor, my brother is coming. - He'll come, Birju.

147
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,243
Driver.

148
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,175
I won't go without my brother. - What are you doing?

149
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,052
I won't go without my brother.

150
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,569
My brother is a kid.

151
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:13,488
Raja ! - Brother.

152
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,406
I won't go without my brother. . .

153
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,884
My brother. . . - What are you doing, Birju?

154
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:19,408
Leave me.

155
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:21,611
My brother. - Birju.

156
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:24,125
My brother. . .

157
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,768
Brother Birju.

158
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:32,843
Raja. Raja. - Brother Birju.

159
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,615
Raja. - Brother Birju.

160
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:37,686
Raja.

161
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:43,094
Brother.

162
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:48,888
Brother.

163
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,367
I. . . can't live without you.

164
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:57,410
They wanted to separate me from you.

165
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,926
I can't live without you.

166
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:03,610
Brother, no one can separate you from me.

167
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:09,045
I promise, I'll never leave you alone, Brother.

168
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,214
Never.

169
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,165
There's a lot of pain.

170
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:40,612
I can't tolerate it.

171
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:47,170
''If you're hurt, I feel the pain. ''

172
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:54,205
''If you're hurt, I feel the pain. ''

173
00:14:55,775 --> 00:15:01,725
''If you cry, my heart feels the grief. ''

174
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:12,450
''That's the bond between brothers. ''

175
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:23,014
''That's the bond between brothers. ''

176
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:29,405
''If you're hurt, I feel the pain. ''

177
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:37,324
''If you cry, my heart feels the grief. ''

178
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:47,850
''That's the bond between brothers. ''

179
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:59,006
''That's the bond between brothers. ''

180
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:38,043
Brother Birju !

181
00:16:58,095 --> 00:17:02,691
''Come to me, let me shower my love on you. ''

182
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:07,526
''Let me ward off any evil eye that might befall you. ''

183
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:12,247
''Come to me, let me shower my love on you. ''

184
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:16,967
''Let me ward off any evil eye that might befall you. ''

185
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:22,086
''Brother, I can lay down my life for you. ''

186
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:27,086
''You're the reason I'm alive. ''

187
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:33,286
''I can sleep only when you lie in peaceful slumber. ''

188
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:40,373
''If you cry, my heart feels the grief. ''

189
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:51,172
''That's the bond between brothers. ''

190
00:17:51,415 --> 00:18:01,893
''That's the bond between brothers. ''

191
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:16,529
Raja. Raja, we won.

192
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:20,046
I hit a goal. We won.

193
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:22,646
Yes, Brother. We won.

194
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:24,574
We won, Brother.

195
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:30,890
Here, Birju. A kilo of carrot.

196
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:32,294
Birju.

197
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:34,367
Doctor.

198
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:36,487
How are you? Hello. - Hello.

199
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,452
How are you? - Fit as a fiddle.

200
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,605
Doctor, please come home for a cup of tea.

201
00:18:40,695 --> 00:18:42,128
No Birju, I must rush to the hospital.

202
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:45,093
Just one cup, please. - Okay.

203
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:48,212
Come. Look, what a clean neighbourhood.

204
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:50,008
Oh God.

205
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:53,207
What sort of misbehaviour is this?

206
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:55,884
Aren't you ashamed of throwing rubbish on the road?

207
00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:58,726
Who is it? Show up.

208
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,366
No one will admit to it this way.

209
00:19:06,735 --> 00:19:09,249
Whose silver spoon is this?

210
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,964
Silver spoon?

211
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:13,006
That's mine. - Yours?

212
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,370
Take it.

213
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,731
Next time, put your garbage in the garbage dump.

214
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:23,204
And take the money for your egg from him. - Fine.

215
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,410
Let's go, Doctor.

216
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:30,731
Raja, your brother is truly amazing.

217
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,487
He is so witty.

218
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:35,733
Now that man will never dump garbage on the road.

219
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:37,771
And he'll never eat eggs either.

220
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,052
You'll sit and have a chat while I make you some carrot pudding.

221
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,208
Listen. . . Birju.

222
00:19:45,655 --> 00:19:46,929
Unbelievable.

223
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,491
Raja, I can't believe that he's the same man. . .

224
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:52,851
. . .you begged to bring home from the hospital 15 years ago!

225
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,731
The change I see in him today. . .

226
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:58,932
. . . is a result of your love and efforts.

227
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:01,410
Really son, you've worked wonders.

228
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:04,373
A wonder is what I've worked, Raja.

229
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:07,413
I've found such a beautiful girl for you. . .

230
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:09,531
. . .that you'll be shocked to see how pretty she is.

231
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,327
Here's her photograph.

232
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:19,091
Isn't she beautiful?

233
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,288
Is this the match you've found for me? This one.

234
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:26,334
She's no ordinary girl.

235
00:20:26,415 --> 00:20:28,883
She belongs to a very rich family.

236
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:31,689
Her father owns eight country bars. . .

237
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:34,569
. . .and 15 breweries.

238
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:38,773
He's the uncrowned king. The uncrowned king.

239
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:39,970
Get lost, idiot.

240
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:45,129
My Raja won't marry any ordinary girl. He'll marry a queen.

241
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:46,853
You're right, Aunt.

242
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:49,645
God has definitely created my partner.

243
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:52,333
But I wonder where she is right now.

244
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:17,283
Sorry. Sorry.

245
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:48,327
Drunkard, rascal, moron.

246
00:21:48,415 --> 00:21:49,928
You're eating my hand instead of the toast.

247
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:51,130
Have you gone crazy?

248
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:52,853
Hi. - Hi.

249
00:21:52,935 --> 00:21:54,926
You're looking gorgeous today. - Thank you.

250
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,165
Madhu, where were you last night?

251
00:21:57,255 --> 00:22:00,930
What do I tell you? Last night, I was in such a big mess that. . .

252
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:03,483
Sorry, sorry. - Sorry, sir. Sorry.

253
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:06,009
I ruined your clothes. - It's okay. . .

254
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:07,448
Can't you watch where you're going? You ruined his clothes.

255
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,844
Don't be angry, don't be angry.

256
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:11,653
He's a poor man. Must have done it by mistake.

257
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:13,373
Go, son. Do your work. - Thank you, sir.

258
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:14,570
Go, go. - Sorry, sir.

259
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:15,974
Don't be angry.

260
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:17,488
Strange man.

261
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:20,453
All his clothes were ruined, but he didn't say a word.

262
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:21,604
Who's this man?

263
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:23,048
He's a Godly man.

264
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,091
He doesn't know what anger is.

265
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:26,688
He's Gandhi reincarnated.

266
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:28,970
People call him Shantipati.

267
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:32,089
I can get him enraged in a snap.

268
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:36,965
Forget it, Madhu. You can't annoy him for anything in the world.

269
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:38,850
Is that a bet?

270
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:42,245
Without saying a single word, I'll push him to the edge. . .

271
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:45,133
.Just watch. . . he'll start yelling like a madman in rage.

272
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:47,570
And this manager will send him to the mental asylum.

273
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:50,010
It's impossible. - It's possible.

274
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:52,768
If I do it, will you hit yourself with your shoe?

275
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:54,493
Done. - Done.

276
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:55,724
Okay.

277
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:57,734
Shantipati.

278
00:22:57,815 --> 00:22:59,692
It's a gift from God.

279
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:02,414
I keep anger miles away from me.

280
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:04,326
Greetings. - Greetings.

281
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:07,930
Sir, I want to talk to you urgently. May I sit here?

282
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:11,087
Yes, please have a seat. - Thank you, thank you.

283
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:13,006
Now tell me, what is it?

284
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:14,926
Actually, it's like this. . .

285
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,251
First promise me, you won't get angry.

286
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:22,485
Why would I get angry? Just tell me what it is.

287
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:26,534
I would tell you but I'm afraid it'll annoy you.

288
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:29,083
No, no. You're getting scared unnecessarily.

289
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,813
Never get angry.

290
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:33,568
Tell me without hesitation. - Fine.

291
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:35,653
Actually, it's like this. . .

292
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:38,330
Forget it, you might get upset.

293
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:41,930
Look, Sister. I've already told you I don't get angry.

294
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:43,653
Tell me what you want to say.

295
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:46,010
Look, you're already a little annoyed.

296
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:50,250
Sister, I don't get annoyed.

297
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,644
Please tell me what you want to say.

298
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:55,886
You're lying. I can see you're getting angry. Look.

299
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:58,808
In swear on God, I'm not.

300
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,490
Please, tell me what you want to say.

301
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,606
Forget it, you're getting angry.

302
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,765
Just a minute, madam. Hold on.

303
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:08,846
Ram Prasad, look at my face and tell me.

304
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:11,290
Do I look angry? - Yes sir, a bit.

305
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,809
This is not anger. - Of course it is.

306
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:17,771
There's sweat on your forehead.

307
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:19,174
What are you saying?

308
00:24:20,055 --> 00:24:22,967
Your eyes are red. - Red?

309
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:27,048
Your nostrils have puffed up.

310
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:31,411
You're breathing fire.

311
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:34,332
And you still say you're not angry?

312
00:24:34,415 --> 00:24:36,724
No, I am not. I don't get angry.

313
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:39,204
I don't, I don't. I don't.

314
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:41,890
Manager. Manager. - Yes, sir.

315
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:44,330
Do you see anger on my face? - Yes, I can.

316
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:46,690
You call this anger.

317
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:49,768
I don't get angry, I don't get angry.

318
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:51,884
Brother.

319
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:54,443
Baldy. My friend, my companion.

320
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,130
Do you see anger on my face? - There's anger.

321
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:01,446
This isn't anger. It isn't, it isn't.

322
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:03,003
Say, that I don't get angry.

323
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:04,767
Say it, say it, say it.

324
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:07,164
Leave him. He'll kill him. - Say it.

325
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:10,049
I don't get angry. I'll kill you.

326
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:13,445
Say that I don't get angry. I don't get angry.

327
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:21,772
Come on, madam. Go on, pick up your shoe and do the honours. . .

328
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:30,285
And don't bet against me again.

329
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,650
Stop basking in the glory of your victory.

330
00:25:32,735 --> 00:25:35,295
Give me a chance to show my talent too.

331
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,047
Really? Fine, given.

332
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,012
You see this matchbox.

333
00:25:39,095 --> 00:25:41,689
I'll keep this on the table, and fling it. . .

334
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,766
. . .such that it lands straight into that man's cup.

335
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,244
That one? Impossible.

336
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:49,689
Is that a bet?

337
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:54,287
If I win, will you do as I say? - Done.

338
00:25:54,695 --> 00:25:55,810
Done.

339
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:01,570
Yes.

340
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:11,568
Now you'll have to do as I say. - Fine, what do I have to do?

341
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:15,933
You'll have to kiss the first man to enter this restaurant.

342
00:26:16,015 --> 00:26:17,448
What? - Yes.

343
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,969
Oh, come on. It's okay to have fun.

344
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:21,283
This is not fair.

345
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,525
She has placed a bet, and she'll have to fulfill it.

346
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,890
Or else, she can admit that she's a coward.

347
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:28,845
I will surely fulfil my bet.

348
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,324
Come on.

349
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:40,849
Hey, fatso. - Are you blind?

350
00:26:41,695 --> 00:26:42,889
Madman.

351
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:46,654
I'm so hungry.

352
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:50,008
I'll have a good meal.

353
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:52,614
Oh, my God.

354
00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:55,451
Listen. - What is it, dear?

355
00:26:55,535 --> 00:26:57,491
I don't want to eat here. - You get good food here.

356
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,645
No, let's go home I'll cook good food for you.

357
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:02,203
No, no. - You'll get good food here.

358
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:08,292
''There's romance in the air. ''

359
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,172
Where to darling?

360
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:12,254
Fine.

361
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:17,290
''There's romance in the air. ''

362
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:19,844
I'm done for.

363
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:24,129
Go ahead, Miss Madhu. Your beloved is here.

364
00:27:58,535 --> 00:27:59,934
What sort of misbehaviour is this?

365
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:02,372
I lost a bet.

366
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:05,572
I had to kiss him, but you came in between. I'm sorry.

367
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:10,809
Look, madam. A girl's first kiss is for her lover.

368
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:12,374
The one she loves. . .

369
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:13,888
. . .and has given her heart to.

370
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:16,535
Not for any stranger passing by. Do you get that?

371
00:28:19,935 --> 00:28:21,004
Madhu.

372
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:24,010
Madhu, what's wrong?

373
00:28:24,255 --> 00:28:26,052
Looks like she's bowled over.

374
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,845
Deepa, I've found the man of my dreams.

375
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:48,809
'Look madam, a girl's first kiss is for her lover. '

376
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,294
'The one she loves. . . '

377
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,774
'. . .and has given her heart to. '

378
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,767
'Not for any stranger passing by. Do you get that?'

379
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:27,773
We've been sitting here all morning. . .

380
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,887
. . . but your lover boy is nowhere to be seen.

381
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,966
My heart says that he will surely come.

382
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:34,808
Even if he does, you can't woo him.

383
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:36,966
I'm in love with him, Nisha. . .

384
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:38,887
. . .and I won't rest in peace until I've wooed him.

385
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:42,968
Impossible, he won't even turn to look at you.

386
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:44,647
Want to bet Rs. 1,000?

387
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:47,973
One shouldn't bet on matters of the heart.

388
00:29:48,415 --> 00:29:50,883
Just say that you don't have the guts.

389
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:52,733
That's an insult to you, Madhu.

390
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:54,931
Bet on it. - Yes, Madhu go ahead.

391
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:57,690
Fine, it's a bet. - Done.

392
00:30:00,695 --> 00:30:01,844
He's here.

393
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:09,847
Please tell me, what you wanted to tell me.

394
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,449
I won't get angry. I won't. Please.

395
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:14,328
Please let me go now. - No.

396
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:15,530
Or else I'll be furious.

397
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:18,687
I broke out from the mental asylum just for you.

398
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,926
Please. What did you want to tell me?

399
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:23,368
Please, please.

400
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,930
Please tell me, what was it?

401
00:30:43,815 --> 00:30:46,852
I think she's calling me. - Not you.

402
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:49,046
She's calling that handsome boy.

403
00:30:49,135 --> 00:30:52,172
Hey, handsome. She's calling you. Look, look there.

404
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:54,249
Hi.

405
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:56,246
Say hi. - Hi.

406
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,008
Did you recognise me?

407
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:02,806
I'm the same one, yesterday. . .we kissed. - Kissed?

408
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:05,648
Can I come there? Okay, I'll come there.

409
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:12,965
I was deeply moved by whatever you said yesterday.

410
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:16,167
Kisses here, kisses there.

411
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:18,052
Kisses everywhere, in everything I do!

412
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:20,251
Kisses everywhere. - So many kisses.

413
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:23,643
Yes. - Look. Everyone's listening.

414
00:31:23,735 --> 00:31:24,850
So what if they are?

415
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:27,495
Why does it bother anyone if we are romancing?

416
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:29,327
Hey, does it bother you? - No, it doesn't.

417
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:32,009
It doesn't bother him. We can continue with the romance.

418
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:34,373
You were right yesterday.

419
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:38,364
A girl's first kiss is for her lover. . .

420
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:43,048
. . .and I've chosen you as my lover, my beloved.

421
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:47,772
Behram, she's such a daring girl. - Correct.

422
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:51,052
Look madam, neither am I your lover, nor are you my darling.

423
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:52,363
So, please leave me alone.

424
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:55,049
The fool says, ''Leave me alone''. - Idiot.

425
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:57,854
Look, don't mistake me for an ordinary girl.

426
00:31:58,135 --> 00:31:59,773
I belong to a very wealthy family.

427
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:01,288
I'm the sister of the wealthiest man of the city. . .

428
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,172
. . . Rana Mahendra Pratap.

429
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:04,934
My name is Madhu.

430
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:12,731
'Wow, king and queen. - Yes. '

431
00:32:12,815 --> 00:32:15,488
'This is you, and this is me. You are the king, and I am the queen. '

432
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,770
For your information, I have finished my BCom.

433
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,766
I know six languages. I am five feet six inches tall. . .

434
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,573
. . .and I weigh only 55 kilos.

435
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:23,566
Now, what do you think about me?

436
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:27,929
Hey stupid, say that you like her.

437
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:31,044
I like you.

438
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:33,569
So, quickly kiss the miss.

439
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:42,208
Very good. Hey fool, you're done for now.

Bhanwar Lal, I saw Abhishek five years ago. . .

476
00:38:05,855 --> 00:38:08,608
. . . but his trip abroad has changed him completely.

477
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:11,851
I would to beg to differ, sir.

478
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:14,403
He did stay abroad for a while. . .

479
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:16,850
. . . but has emerged as untouched as wax from water.

480
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:19,092
He hasn't learnt their ways or culture.

481
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:21,166
He come back the same person he was.

482
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:23,815
That's the reason why we selected him for our sister.

483
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,289
There comes Madhu.

484
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:28,175
Come, Madhu. Meet him.

485
00:38:28,495 --> 00:38:31,134
He's the Prince of Nigampur, Abhiskek Sanyal.

486
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,843
That's his uncle, and she's my sister, Madhu.

487
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:36,005
Greetings. - Greetings.

488
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:39,323
Beautiful. Very beautiful.

489
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:41,883
Fool. A complete fool.

490
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,129
Did you say something? - Yes.

491
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:48,605
No. Yes, she was praising you.

492
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:51,050
He's beyond praise.

493
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:53,287
He owns hundreds of mills and factories. . .

494
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,854
. . .and dozens of magnificent bungalows.

495
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:58,371
Yes. And the bungalow where I live. . .

496
00:38:58,455 --> 00:39:02,164
. . .also has a personal zoo in it.

497
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:03,768
I'm sure they all live there.

498
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,003
Did you say something?

499
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:09,368
No. Yes, she was saying. . .

500
00:39:09,455 --> 00:39:12,731
. . .that you all have a chat while we get something to eat. - Yes.

501
00:39:12,815 --> 00:39:14,533
Come, sit. Please sit.

502
00:39:14,615 --> 00:39:18,085
Your sister is very pretty and polite. Just like my nephew.

503
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:20,211
Sister-in-law, who is this moron?

504
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:23,093
You shouldn't speak like that. They're royalty.

505
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:24,972
They own property worth millions.

506
00:39:25,055 --> 00:39:27,285
Your brother is arranging your alliance with him.

507
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:29,252
Fixing my alliance with him? - Yes.

508
00:39:29,335 --> 00:39:32,884
I wouldn't appoint him a servant in my house.

509
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:35,974
Sister-in-law. - Yes.

510
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:38,444
I've chosen my man. - What?

511
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:43,570
And I've. . . promised to meet him today as well.

512
00:39:43,655 --> 00:39:45,054
Mr. Ranglani, don't worry.

513
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,534
I will have this container sent to Kolhapur. . .

514
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:48,173
. . .and I'll take these two containers to the docks.

515
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,608
I need to leave early today.

516
00:39:49,695 --> 00:39:51,492
I've to take my wife out for shopping.

517
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:52,769
So take care of the work here.

518
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:54,766
Mr. Ranglani, today I'd like to leave early as well.

519
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:57,972
You aren't even married. Why do you want to go home early?

520
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:01,008
I see. You're having an affair.

521
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:03,051
Go on, have fun. - Thank you, sir.

522
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:07,487
Hello. You are on your way to meet Madhu.

523
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:10,289
And you are?

524
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,725
Nisha. Madhu's friend.

525
00:40:12,975 --> 00:40:14,613
I want to tell you. . .

526
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:17,767
. . .that Madhu is playing a charade of love with you.

527
00:40:17,855 --> 00:40:19,334
What? - Yes.

528
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:22,771
It's her hobby to fool people. . .

529
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:26,006
. . .and this time, you happen to be that wealthy, pampered girl's victim.

530
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:28,051
For a mere bet of Rs. 1000.

531
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,888
You are lying. - And what if it turns out to be true?

532
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:37,213
I'll never forgive that wealthy girl.

533
00:40:37,295 --> 00:40:39,365
Here Madhu, your bet money.

534
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:42,493
All of Rs. 1000? - Yes. All of them.

535
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:45,851
There's one thing, Madhu. No one can win a bet with you.

536
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:49,325
Really, you made Raja fall for you so easily.

537
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:53,806
Dear, I always do what I say.

538
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:58,531
And I never keep the money that I win.

539
00:40:58,815 --> 00:41:01,648
Eat, drink and be merry. I'll pay the bill.

540
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:08,255
Raja. You. . .

541
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:11,532
Shut up. Don't you dare take my name.

542
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:14,290
I know the truth now.

543
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:18,607
Look, Raja. I admit I did bet. . . but. . .

544
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:21,011
. . .the truth is that I really love you.

545
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,165
You'll never know what love really means.

546
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:25,013
It's just a bet for you.

547
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:27,007
A mere bet made for Rs. 1000.

548
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:30,094
Thankfully Nisha made me see the truth.

549
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:33,173
Else, I'd have continued believing your pretence of love.

550
00:41:33,495 --> 00:41:36,134
Never show me your filthy face again. Get that?

551
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:38,613
Raja. Raja.

552
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:40,123
You cheat.

553
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:44,727
Raja, please listen to me. You're mistaken.

554
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:47,454
She. . . it was she who instigated me.

555
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:48,968
That's why I betted.

556
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:51,011
I really love you. Really.

557
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:52,733
I don't want to hear anything.

558
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:54,328
Stop following me. Okay?

559
00:41:54,415 --> 00:41:55,450
Listen to me.

560
00:41:55,895 --> 00:41:57,374
Please forgive me.

561
00:41:57,455 --> 00:41:59,685
And say that you love me. - I hate you.

562
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,409
Tell me, you love me. - I hate you.

563
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:06,045
Please, tell me you love me. - I hate you.

564
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:08,054
You won't say it. - Never.

565
00:42:08,135 --> 00:42:09,614
Then, take this.

566
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,373
What are you doing? - I'll show you.

567
00:42:14,055 --> 00:42:17,570
Thief. Thief. - Look. . .

568
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:19,734
Thief. Thief. - Leave me.

569
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:21,089
That thief is stealing that girl's purse.

570
00:42:21,175 --> 00:42:23,484
Constable, constable. That thief is snatching that girl's purse.

571
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:27,648
There, there. Not me. Over there.

572
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:29,805
Save me. - Yes, quickly.

573
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:32,887
Help. - He's the one. He's the thief. Catch him.

574
00:42:32,975 --> 00:42:35,125
You rogue, you dare snatch the girl's purse.

575
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:37,285
You thief. - Constable, I'm no thief.

576
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,172
My purse. Sir, this is my purse.

577
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:40,768
Thank God, you caught him.

578
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:42,652
Madhu, what is all this? Tell them who I am.

579
00:42:42,735 --> 00:42:45,454
Madam, do you know him? - No, sir.

580
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:49,005
How would a decent girl like me know a thief like him?

581
00:42:49,095 --> 00:42:50,210
So he's a liar.

582
00:42:50,295 --> 00:42:52,763
Come on, I'll take you to the police station and teach you a lesson.

583
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:57,369
Just a minute, sir. I want to have a word with this thief in private.

584
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:00,126
Look Raja, there's still time.

585
00:43:00,215 --> 00:43:01,694
Say that you love me.

586
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:03,732
Even if I were sentenced to death. . .

587
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,124
. . .I wouldn't say that I love you.

588
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:08,490
Take him away. He says he won't mend his ways.

589
00:43:08,735 --> 00:43:10,612
Come on, come. - Take him away.

590
00:43:11,735 --> 00:43:14,488
What have you done, Madhu? You got Raja arrested.

591
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:16,964
What else could I have done? He wouldn't agree to say 'I love you'.

592
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:18,852
You've invited trouble.

593
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:20,687
Now he'll hate you all his life.

594
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:22,843
What should I do now?

595
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:24,846
Now, try his family.

596
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,244
You mean get his family arrested as well? Fantastic.

597
00:43:27,335 --> 00:43:30,452
Idiot, I mean try to win them over.

598
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:33,050
I'll do that.

599
00:43:33,495 --> 00:43:37,249
? '

600
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:39,644
Birju. - Yes.

601
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:41,930
Abdul was saying that Raja didn't come home all night.

602
00:43:42,015 --> 00:43:45,166
Yes, that's what has been troubling me.

603
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,370
Oh, God.

604
00:43:46,455 --> 00:43:49,208
When young boys start staying out all night. . .

605
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:51,890
. . .assume that youth has overflown.

606
00:43:51,975 --> 00:43:54,887
Shut up, you fool. Must you talk rubbish all the time?

607
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:57,929
Did you inquire at Raja's factory? - Yes, Aunt.

608
00:43:58,015 --> 00:44:00,734
He didn't even go to work. - Oh, God.

609
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:03,124
He didn't go to work, nor did he return at night.

610
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:05,171
Then where did he go? - I'll tell you.

611
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:08,723
He was with me all night.

612
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,567
But who are you?

613
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:12,327
The queen to my king.

614
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:16,012
Now you'd will ask, how all this happened.

615
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:20,284
Aunt, this is a two-year old story.

616
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:24,288
Oh God, you've known Raja for two years? - Yes.

617
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:28,290
We've been in love for the last two years.

618
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:30,851
But last night. . .

619
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:33,407
. . .there was an accident.

620
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:38,409
Accident? - Yes.

621
00:44:38,895 --> 00:44:43,127
Not the one with the cars, but our eyes and hearts.

622
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:44,568
How was that?

623
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:49,208
In the dark of a rainy stormy night. . .

624
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,693
. . .amidst old ruins. . .

625
00:44:53,295 --> 00:44:56,128
Both of us were shivering with cold.

626
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:02,369
Raja somehow lit a fire.

627
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:04,806
That fire burned outside. . .

628
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:07,245
. . .while we burned within.

629
00:45:08,015 --> 00:45:11,803
And somewhere far away, there was a song playing. . .

630
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:14,564
''Your beauty is enchanting. ''

631
00:45:14,655 --> 00:45:17,249
''My love is passionate. ''

632
00:45:17,335 --> 00:45:20,805
''I might make a mistake. ''

633
00:45:21,735 --> 00:45:23,373
Shut up, puny guy.

634
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,532
Then what, Sister? - Then.

635
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:29,449
He looked at me like Dilip Kumar ( Indian actor).

636
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:32,324
I smiled like Vyanjanti Mala ( Indian actor).

637
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:35,612
Then he winked at me like Rajesh Khanna ( Indian actor).

638
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:38,011
I shied away like Sharmila ( Indian actor).

639
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:40,650
Then he held my hands like Amitabh ( Indian actor).

640
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:43,443
And I fidgeted like Rekha ( Indian actor).

641
00:45:43,935 --> 00:45:46,165
And suddenly, he turned into Shatru ( Indian actor).

642
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:47,774
And I got scared like Reena ( Indian actor).

643
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:50,574
He took me in his arms like Dharamendra ( Indian actor). . .

644
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:54,170
And I wriggled and squirmed like Hema ( Indian actor), but. . .

645
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:55,449
But what happened?

646
00:45:55,535 --> 00:46:00,973
''Oh Lord Ram, your Holy Ganges has been rendered impure. . . ''

647
00:46:01,055 --> 00:46:04,843
''. . . in cleansing sinners of their sins. ''

648
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:10,926
''Oh Lord Ram, your Holy Ganges has been rendered impure. . . ''

649
00:46:11,095 --> 00:46:14,644
''. . . in cleansing sinners of their sins. ''

650
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:19,531
Oh, God. That means, you did it. - Yes.

651
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:25,653
And at the crack of dawn, he left me like a villain.

652
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:35,368
I can't face anyone now.

653
00:46:35,975 --> 00:46:40,173
If Raja doesn't accept me, I'll commit suicide.

654
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:41,928
I'll kill myself.

655
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:44,291
I'll sacrifice myself to the pyre of a husband that never was.

656
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:46,851
I'll kill myself.

657
00:46:48,495 --> 00:46:50,406
I'm killing myself, isn't anyone watching?

658
00:46:50,655 --> 00:46:52,532
Look, I'm killing myself. - Wait.

659
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:53,764
What are you doing, my dear?

660
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:56,733
Why should I stay alive now, Aunt?

661
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,885
No dear, you must live.

662
00:46:58,975 --> 00:47:00,567
Brother Raja is here.

663
00:47:01,095 --> 00:47:03,655
Let him come, I'll set him straight today.

664
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:07,652
Aunt, it's your personal issue. . .

665
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:10,204
. . .you deal with it, I'll go inside.

666
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:11,728
Fine, go in.

667
00:47:12,135 --> 00:47:13,648
Greetings, brother Raja.

668
00:47:13,735 --> 00:47:15,885
What's the matter? You look very fresh.

669
00:47:15,975 --> 00:47:18,614
Do I look fresh to you? Do I look fresh to you?

670
00:47:18,895 --> 00:47:21,489
I'm tired after last night. - I know, I know.

671
00:47:21,735 --> 00:47:23,373
What was it that tired you?

672
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:26,210
Get lost. Just get lost.

673
00:47:26,815 --> 00:47:30,171
Yes, go inside. You're going to get it there.

674
00:47:37,935 --> 00:47:39,732
So you've got yourself disgraced?

675
00:47:39,935 --> 00:47:44,850
'Oh, God. How did they come to know that I spent the night in jail?'

676
00:47:46,015 --> 00:47:49,451
You mean, you all know where I've been all night?

677
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:53,005
We don't just know about it. We have the complete report as well.

678
00:47:53,295 --> 00:47:56,014
Look Aunt, it wasn't my fault.

679
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:57,483
That girl got me into this mess.

680
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,850
Yes, I'm sure the girl got him into it.

681
00:47:59,935 --> 00:48:02,165
Stop it. He's not a baby. . .

682
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:03,813
. . .that any girl would trick him that easily.

683
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:06,409
Didn't it shame you to besmirch her honour?

684
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:09,293
Let it be, Aunt. How was she dishonoured?

685
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,728
I'm the one who was disgraced.

686
00:48:10,815 --> 00:48:13,693
Great. You eat the forbidden fruit. . .

687
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:15,686
. . .and blame someone else for it?

688
00:48:15,775 --> 00:48:17,527
What are you saying?

689
00:48:17,615 --> 00:48:19,253
I didn't even get a piece of bread.

690
00:48:19,335 --> 00:48:21,007
I slept on an empty stomach in the lock up.

691
00:48:21,095 --> 00:48:23,450
In the lock up? - Yes, Aunt. In the lock up.

692
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:24,854
And do you know why?

693
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,290
Because I didn't tell that girl that I love you.

694
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,286
That's why she got me .

695
00:48:29,655 --> 00:48:32,852
I swear, Aunt. If I ever run into that girl again. . .

696
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:36,211
. . .I'll teach her a lesson she'll never forget.

697
00:48:36,295 --> 00:48:37,444
I won't spare her.

698
00:48:37,535 --> 00:48:39,765
Please calm down and have water. - Thank you.

699
00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:43,571
You? What are you doing here?

700
00:48:43,815 --> 00:48:46,488
Aunt, this is the girl who got me arrested.

701
00:48:46,695 --> 00:48:48,925
Tell them, tell them what's the truth. - No.

702
00:48:49,015 --> 00:48:51,768
Tell them, tell them or else I'll. . . - I'll tell them.

703
00:48:53,535 --> 00:48:57,164
Everything I said was a lie.

704
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,810
The truth is, I really love Raja. . .

705
00:49:02,415 --> 00:49:04,292
. . . but he doesn't love me.

706
00:49:04,615 --> 00:49:07,846
When if I didn't succeed by hook, I had to resort to crook.

707
00:49:08,175 --> 00:49:09,733
What would you have done, had you been in my place?

708
00:49:09,815 --> 00:49:12,249
We'd have done the same thing.

709
00:49:12,335 --> 00:49:15,566
Mind your tongue, and get out of here.

710
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:17,646
Come on. Come on. And you too.

711
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:20,044
Get out, come on get out.

712
00:49:20,135 --> 00:49:24,526
Don't push her. She's our sister. Get that.

713
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:28,324
You moron, take your sister with you.

714
00:49:28,415 --> 00:49:29,609
And where are you going? - Inside.

715
00:49:29,695 --> 00:49:32,084
Come on, get out. Come on.

716
00:49:34,535 --> 00:49:35,729
Go on.

717
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:05,210
''Oh, my heartless, infidel tormentor. . . ''

I'm going to marry him. - What?

788
00:56:30,535 --> 00:56:32,332
Raja, save me. - Let's go darling, to the temple.

789
00:56:32,415 --> 00:56:34,645
You are not going to any temple. Come home with me.

Raja, I'm his husband. - You're not.

Don't separate us. - Come on. Come with me.

I don't know, Raja. This morning he came home and said. . .

. . .that he has a severe stomach ache.

801
00:56:56,735 --> 00:57:00,284
Yes. - Yes, this is the bottle of potion.

802
00:57:00,575 --> 00:57:03,169
Brother Birju downed the entire bottle.

803
00:57:03,255 --> 00:57:05,132
It's a result of a that.

804
00:57:05,215 --> 00:57:08,013
Charred gold potion?. But where is this aunt?

805
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,165
Aunt. Aunt.

806
00:57:15,295 --> 00:57:19,447
Dear, can't you watch where you're going?

807
00:57:20,415 --> 00:57:21,530
Who are you?

808
00:57:21,615 --> 00:57:24,209
She's Madhu. - Madhu?

809
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,886
Aunt. Aunt. Aunt Madhu.

810
00:57:27,975 --> 00:57:29,249
Hey, Aunt. - What?

811
00:57:29,335 --> 00:57:31,451
My brother is acting weird.

812
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:32,888
What potion did you make him drink?

813
00:57:32,975 --> 00:57:34,567
What potion did I give him?

814
00:57:35,975 --> 00:57:37,966
That man drank all of it? - Yes.

815
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:40,285
It's a terrible mistake. I gave him the wrong potion.

816
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:43,845
Catch. This has charred gold. . .

817
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,972
. . .and the effect won't wear off for eight-ten days.

818
00:57:47,055 --> 00:57:49,853
What, the effect won't wear off for eight-ten days? - No.

819
00:57:49,935 --> 00:57:51,334
Aunt, there must be an antidote for it.

820
00:57:51,415 --> 00:57:52,530
There is an antidote all right. . .

821
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:54,890
. . . but we'll have to go to the jungle to get the herbs.

822
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:56,533
Aunt, let's go quickly.

823
00:57:56,615 --> 00:58:00,847
You are not my husband that I'd wander off to the jungle with you.

824
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:04,484
Get lost. I won't go with you. - Why won't you go?

825
00:58:04,575 --> 00:58:06,770
If you don't, I'll take you forcefully.

826
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:08,004
Come on.

827
00:58:09,055 --> 00:58:12,127
You'll take me forcefully? - Yes.

828
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:13,894
Me? - Yes, you.

829
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:16,443
Take me along. Take me along.

830
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,684
What are you doing? - Take me with you.

831
00:58:17,775 --> 00:58:19,094
Take me with you. - Leave me.

832
00:58:19,175 --> 00:58:22,724
Look Aunt, I am warning you. . . - To hell with your aunt.

833
00:58:23,175 --> 00:58:26,326
Don't lock horns with me.

834
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:28,929
Don't try to threaten us.

835
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:31,126
Quietly go to the jungle.

836
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:33,968
Or else, I'll punch you, fatty.

837
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:37,491
Why you. . .

838
00:58:37,575 --> 00:58:39,293
You call me fatty?

839
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:42,685
Does your dad pay for my food? You, fool.

840
00:58:43,295 --> 00:58:45,013
Does your dad pay for my food?

841
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,208
You call me fatty. Back off. - I'll die.

842
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:51,253
You son of a drunkard. Does your dad pay for my food?

843
00:58:51,335 --> 00:58:53,246
Let go. - Leave me.

844
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:54,688
I'll die, let go of me.

845
00:58:54,775 --> 00:58:57,164
Aunt, I beg of you. I plead to you.

846
00:58:57,255 --> 00:58:58,973
Let him go, or else he'll die.

847
00:58:59,055 --> 00:59:00,408
Aunt.

848
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:04,204
Now that you're requesting politely, I'll let go.

849
00:59:04,295 --> 00:59:05,614
Go.

850
00:59:07,215 --> 00:59:08,330
Bloody fool.

851
00:59:08,735 --> 00:59:11,807
For one who talks nicely to me. . .

852
00:59:12,135 --> 00:59:15,445
. . .I can go to any lengths.

853
00:59:16,055 --> 00:59:20,333
Let's go, my boy. Let's go to the jungle.

854
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:25,491
Now, they'll make merry in the jungle. - Yes.

855
00:59:26,615 --> 00:59:34,124
''Today the weather is capricious. ''

856
00:59:35,135 --> 00:59:38,411
Aunt, I'm tired of going around these mountains.

857
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:39,848
Where would we find that herb?

858
00:59:39,935 --> 00:59:45,248
No pain. . . no gain, Raja.

859
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:47,166
What are you doing?

860
00:59:47,255 --> 00:59:51,089
Should I say something? I find you very adorable.

861
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:54,053
Look, Aunt. Enough is enough. If I lose it once, I'll. . .

862
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:27,253
Why you. . .

863
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,445
''Tequila. ''

864
01:02:31,775 --> 01:02:33,970
Aunt, what are you doing? - Where are you hurt?

865
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:35,370
Forget that.

866
01:03:26,655 --> 01:03:27,724
Shut up.

867
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:45,005
What nonsense is this? What nonsense is this?

868
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:47,453
Aren't you ashamed to do all this?

869
01:03:49,415 --> 01:03:52,407
She's not going to mend her ways. Never.

870
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:03,165
Now it's punctured. The city is 200 km from here.

871
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:06,247
We'll have to spend the night in the jungle.

872
01:04:06,455 --> 01:04:09,970
Not at all. I'll arrange to get us out of here.

873
01:04:54,255 --> 01:04:56,894
Yes, come on. Come on, Raja.

874
01:04:57,175 --> 01:04:59,211
Come on. Fantastic.

875
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,445
Do it. Come on, Raja. Come on.

876
01:05:01,735 --> 01:05:03,168
Fantastic. You can do it.

877
01:05:03,255 --> 01:05:05,564
Come on, Raja. That's it. That's it.

878
01:05:05,655 --> 01:05:07,213
Come on, Raja. Come on. Yes.

879
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:09,126
Fantastic. You're great. Superb.

880
01:05:09,415 --> 01:05:11,883
Raja, you're great. Great.

881
01:05:12,055 --> 01:05:13,613
Come on, Raja. Do it.

882
01:05:13,695 --> 01:05:15,606
Come on. Twist more. Come on.

883
01:05:15,695 --> 01:05:16,969
Come on, Raja. You can do it.

884
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,170
Come on. You can do it.

885
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:19,483
Come on, Raja.

886
01:05:25,215 --> 01:05:26,489
You did it.

887
01:05:32,535 --> 01:05:35,652
No matter what you say, all this is happening because of you.

888
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,768
Had you listened to me. . .

889
01:05:37,855 --> 01:05:39,174
. . .I wouldn't have had to don the guise of an old woman.

890
01:05:39,255 --> 01:05:40,927
Neither would our Jeep have a flat tyre. . .

891
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:42,733
. . . nor would we be stuck in the jungle

892
01:05:43,495 --> 01:05:45,167
Look, there is still time.

893
01:05:45,695 --> 01:05:47,253
Admit that you love me.

894
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:49,451
What are you harping about love?

895
01:05:50,055 --> 01:05:51,613
You love me a lot?

896
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:53,334
Yes, Raja.

897
01:05:54,255 --> 01:05:58,806
Will you do whatever I say?

898
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,008
Try me.

899
01:06:06,455 --> 01:06:08,207
Then strip. - No.

900
01:06:10,135 --> 01:06:11,807
I want to love you.

901
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,808
Right now.

902
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:18,573
Come on. - No, Raja.

903
01:06:19,335 --> 01:06:20,927
Is that a way to show love?

904
01:06:21,015 --> 01:06:22,653
This is my way.

905
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,606
You wanted me, right?

906
01:06:26,495 --> 01:06:28,850
Then you'll have to fulfil my wish too.

907
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:31,765
You'll have to surrender yourself to me.

908
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:35,814
No, Raja. You can ask for my life. But. . .

909
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:39,092
I don't want your life. I want your body.

910
01:06:39,175 --> 01:06:40,369
No.

911
01:06:45,895 --> 01:06:47,123
No.

912
01:06:49,615 --> 01:06:54,928
I knew that your love is nothing but pretence.

913
01:06:55,815 --> 01:06:57,487
It's a sham. - No.

914
01:06:59,775 --> 01:07:02,448
Raja, listen to me.

915
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,648
Believe me.

916
01:07:05,295 --> 01:07:08,048
I love you. I really love you.

917
01:07:08,135 --> 01:07:09,329
No.

918
01:07:10,415 --> 01:07:11,734
You don't love me.

919
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:15,373
You're a liar and your love, a lie.

920
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,254
Stop, Raja.

921
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:30,454
If this is the only way to win your love. . .

922
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:34,008
. . . if this is what love means to you. . .

923
01:07:34,815 --> 01:07:37,045
. . . if lust is a paradigm of love in your eyes. . .

924
01:07:37,295 --> 01:07:40,173
. . .then come, and take my body.

925
01:07:41,495 --> 01:07:43,884
Come. Satiate your desire.

926
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:48,014
Obliterate your limits and my chastity.

927
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:51,727
Come, Raja. Come. I said, come on.

928
01:08:21,015 --> 01:08:26,851
Madhu, your chastity is dearer to me than my life.

929
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:30,565
Lust is not a paradigm for love in my eyes. . .

930
01:08:31,855 --> 01:08:33,925
. . .and I haven't forgotten my limits.

931
01:08:36,815 --> 01:08:41,286
I made a grave mistake by disbelieving your love.

932
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:44,208
Forgive me, Madhu.

933
01:08:44,895 --> 01:08:46,089
Forgive me.

934
01:08:52,815 --> 01:08:56,694
Madhu, my name is Raja ( King ).

935
01:08:58,095 --> 01:09:01,212
Why didn't your family name you Rani ( Queen )?

936
01:09:12,335 --> 01:09:16,010
'Brother, when his name is Raja then why isn't my name Rani? '

937
01:09:19,815 --> 01:09:23,603
Raja. - Yes, your childhood friend Raja.

938
01:09:24,175 --> 01:09:27,167
Raja. Raja.

939
01:10:05,175 --> 01:10:10,408
''Neither do I ask for flowers nor spring. ''

''It brings along fervour and intoxication. ''

''Neither do I ask for flowers nor spring. ''

962
01:13:34,695 --> 01:13:39,769
''I ask for neither peace nor solace. ''

963
01:13:40,175 --> 01:13:45,249
''Beloved, I just want your love. ''

964
01:14:00,615 --> 01:14:02,571
Today, I'm really happy.

965
01:14:03,055 --> 01:14:06,570
Thanks God you both have united.

966
01:14:06,895 --> 01:14:08,374
This had to happen, brother.

967
01:14:09,255 --> 01:14:11,132
The bond which you had formed in our childhood. . .

968
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:13,612
. . . had to come true someday.

969
01:14:14,855 --> 01:14:17,688
Yes, brother. She's Madhu.

970
01:14:18,575 --> 01:14:19,803
My childhood Rani.

971
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:29,768
God bless you, dear.

972
01:14:36,695 --> 01:14:39,573
You don't know your brothers.

973
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:41,930
Raja has told me everything, brother.

974
01:14:42,415 --> 01:14:45,487
I know why this alliance was broken.

975
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:48,533
So we have to decided to register our marriage in the court, brother.

976
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:50,810
No, Raja. No.

977
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:53,532
This won't be right.

978
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:58,890
I will go to my friend to mend this broken alliance.

979
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:00,923
I will.

980
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:04,811
I'd never imagined that the auspicious day would arrive so soon.

981
01:15:04,895 --> 01:15:06,123
I'll take your leave now.

982
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:07,568
I need to make arrangements for the engagement. - Bye.

983
01:15:07,655 --> 01:15:09,327
I have to invite the relatives too.

984
01:15:09,415 --> 01:15:11,724
There are countless things to do. Bye. - Bye.

985
01:15:11,815 --> 01:15:13,328
Bye. - Come.

986
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:17,608
Hurry up, driver. Hurry up.

987
01:15:39,655 --> 01:15:43,011
I see. So that's your brother.

988
01:15:43,175 --> 01:15:46,645
Yes, Mr. Rana. He's Raja.

989
01:15:51,295 --> 01:15:54,128
Won't you ask your friend to come in?

990
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:58,329
Your stature doesn't permit you to enter this house.

991
01:15:58,415 --> 01:15:59,643
Mr. Rana.

992
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:03,966
Mr. Rana, you don't know.

993
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:07,253
Raja and Madhu love each other.

994
01:16:07,335 --> 01:16:10,611
I know. I know very well.

995
01:16:11,335 --> 01:16:14,168
My sister loves a man. . .

996
01:16:14,255 --> 01:16:17,372
. . .who can't even match Rana Mahendra Pratap's boots in stature.

997
01:16:17,455 --> 01:16:19,605
Mr. Rana. - No.

998
01:16:21,295 --> 01:16:25,811
Mr. Rana, it's true that we're poor.

999
01:16:26,055 --> 01:16:29,809
But love never considers social differences.

1000
01:16:30,175 --> 01:16:34,532
The truth is that marriages are made in heaven.

1001
01:16:34,615 --> 01:16:37,083
No. Marriages are made on earth.

1002
01:16:37,335 --> 01:16:40,725
You deliberately trapped my sister in the web of your brother's love. . .

1003
01:16:40,815 --> 01:16:43,409
. . .so that you can settle your scores with me.

1004
01:16:43,495 --> 01:16:44,974
No, brother. That's not true.

1005
01:16:45,055 --> 01:16:46,647
Of course it is.

1006
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,885
It's a filthy conspiracy of a devious mind.

1007
01:16:50,455 --> 01:16:54,130
Mr. Rana, I had heard of lowly people existing in this world. . .

1008
01:16:54,895 --> 01:16:57,284
. . . but you've proved to be worse than them.

1009
01:17:00,455 --> 01:17:05,006
I could have replied aptly to your insolence. . .

1010
01:17:06,735 --> 01:17:10,444
. . . but you're not worth even that.

1011
01:17:12,015 --> 01:17:14,483
And you better get one thing straight.

1012
01:17:15,335 --> 01:17:17,769
You're getting engaged to Abhishek tomorrow.

1013
01:17:19,615 --> 01:17:23,290
If anybody tries to hinder this auspicious ritual. . .

1014
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:26,764
. . .then be it a palanquin or a bier. . .

1015
01:17:27,655 --> 01:17:29,373
. . . it'll leave this house in all grandeur.

1016
01:17:45,135 --> 01:17:48,411
Ladies and gentlemen, I need a couple of your minutes.

1017
01:18:03,055 --> 01:18:07,253
I announce my only sister Madhu's engagement. . .

1018
01:18:07,335 --> 01:18:10,725
. . .with the Prince of Nigampur, Abhishek.

1019
01:18:12,135 --> 01:18:13,648
Congratulations. - Thank you.

1020
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:15,214
Congratulations.

1021
01:18:15,455 --> 01:18:18,652
Sumitra, get Madhu. - I'll call her right away.

1022
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,612
Why do you all look so shocked?

1023
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:01,126
Brother made the right announcement.

1024
01:19:02,055 --> 01:19:03,613
I'll surely get engaged. . .

1025
01:19:04,095 --> 01:19:07,690
. . . but the groom won't be the prince of some kingdom.

1026
01:19:08,775 --> 01:19:10,049
He'll be the ruler of my heart, Raja.

1027
01:19:10,135 --> 01:19:12,251
Madhu, what nonsense is this?

1028
01:19:12,335 --> 01:19:14,803
This is not a nonsense. It's my decision, brother.

1029
01:19:14,895 --> 01:19:17,534
Who are you to take the decisions for yourself?

1030
01:19:17,615 --> 01:19:20,732
Rana Mahendra Pratap is the only one who takes decisions in this house.

1031
01:19:24,495 --> 01:19:29,888
I'm leaving the house where I'm not free to live my life.

1032
01:19:36,615 --> 01:19:39,607
It's because of this rogue that you're humiliating the family. . .

1033
01:19:39,695 --> 01:19:41,333
. . . in the presence of all these people and leaving.

1034
01:19:41,415 --> 01:19:44,612
I'll see how he leaves this house alive.

1035
01:19:45,295 --> 01:19:49,652
You may shoot, but only over your sister's dead body.

1036
01:19:50,775 --> 01:19:52,049
Shoot.

1037
01:19:53,295 --> 01:19:55,411
Yes, shoot if you have the guts to.

1038
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:02,808
No. Have you lost it?

1039
01:20:02,895 --> 01:20:05,250
Yes, I have. I'll kill her.

1040
01:20:05,335 --> 01:20:06,404
Who has stopped you? Shoot me.

1041
01:20:06,495 --> 01:20:09,407
Yes, I will. - Stop it.

1042
01:20:10,255 --> 01:20:15,090
And you. . .you're ready to die for this boy.

1043
01:20:15,175 --> 01:20:19,293
But ask him once. Ask him what he can do for you.

1044
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,009
Ask him.

1045
01:20:24,495 --> 01:20:26,087
You sling mud on the age old repute. . .

1046
01:20:26,175 --> 01:20:27,927
. . .earned by your ancestors for his sake.

1047
01:20:28,015 --> 01:20:31,246
Ask him what he can do for you. Ask him.

1048
01:20:35,015 --> 01:20:36,926
You reject 20 years of our love. . .

1049
01:20:37,015 --> 01:20:40,087
. . .for the few days of togetherness with him?

1050
01:20:40,175 --> 01:20:42,245
Ask him what he can do for you.

1051
01:20:42,775 --> 01:20:43,924
Ask him.

1052
01:20:57,575 --> 01:21:00,931
Ask him if he can walk these 20 steps barefoot.

1053
01:21:01,015 --> 01:21:02,607
Ask him.

1054
01:21:21,535 --> 01:21:24,652
No, Raja. Don't do that.

1055
01:21:33,535 --> 01:21:34,684
Raja.

1056
01:21:41,455 --> 01:21:42,729
No.

1057
01:21:55,175 --> 01:21:56,324
Raja.

1058
01:22:02,895 --> 01:22:04,123
Raja.

1059
01:22:04,775 --> 01:22:06,049
No.

1060
01:22:22,055 --> 01:22:23,170
No.

1061
01:22:42,615 --> 01:22:43,650
Raja.

1062
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:45,529
No.

1063
01:22:46,855 --> 01:22:50,814
See that. It took all but four steps for your love to give up.

1064
01:22:50,895 --> 01:22:53,363
How will he stand by you all your life?

1065
01:22:53,575 --> 01:22:57,284
Love is no child's play.

1066
01:22:57,855 --> 01:23:00,847
It puts the bravest of the brave to trial.

1067
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:04,371
Well said ! Well said !

1068
01:23:07,575 --> 01:23:08,769
No!

1069
01:23:18,615 --> 01:23:19,809
Raja.

1070
01:24:44,015 --> 01:24:48,486
Don't ever put true love to trial.

1071
01:24:49,295 --> 01:24:53,334
It puts the best of the best to shame.

1072
01:24:54,735 --> 01:24:57,807
Well said, Raja. What a couplet. Wow!

1073
01:25:02,535 --> 01:25:05,652
Please give my Madhu's hand in mine.

1074
01:25:18,775 --> 01:25:21,289
Take her and lock her up in her room. - No.

1075
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:23,093
Don't beat Raja.

1076
01:25:23,255 --> 01:25:26,691
Throw him back into the filth he came from.

1077
01:25:27,295 --> 01:25:28,614
Scoundrel.

1078
01:25:37,095 --> 01:25:40,883
That's Raja ! That's Raja !

1079
01:25:41,535 --> 01:25:44,003
What? No.

1080
01:25:45,815 --> 01:25:46,930
Raja.

1081
01:25:49,295 --> 01:25:50,523
Raja.

1082
01:25:51,935 --> 01:25:53,129
Raja.

1083
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:55,164
Raja.

1084
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,366
Raja. Raja.

1085
01:25:58,975 --> 01:26:00,249
Raja.

1086
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:02,684
Raja.

1087
01:26:02,975 --> 01:26:05,728
Open your eyes, Raja. Open your eyes.

1088
01:26:08,935 --> 01:26:10,209
What happened?

1089
01:26:11,575 --> 01:26:17,411
Oh, God. Who did this to Raja?

1090
01:26:18,695 --> 01:26:23,086
I know who thrashed my brother, Aunt.

1091
01:26:24,655 --> 01:26:26,134
I won't spare them.

1092
01:26:28,255 --> 01:26:30,086
I won't spare them.

1093
01:26:30,455 --> 01:26:32,013
I won't spare them.

1094
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,890
Hey, you can't go inside?

1095
01:26:53,615 --> 01:26:57,130
Come down. Come out.

1096
01:26:58,935 --> 01:27:02,484
Rana Pratap, come down.

1097
01:27:03,175 --> 01:27:05,052
Come out. Come here.

1098
01:27:05,335 --> 01:27:09,214
If you're man enough, come down. Come down.

1099
01:27:10,055 --> 01:27:13,172
You scoundrel, how dare you challenge us right in our home?

1100
01:27:13,255 --> 01:27:15,689
Stay there. Stay there. I'm coming.

1101
01:27:15,895 --> 01:27:19,012
Come down. I won't spare you. Come down.

1102
01:27:19,095 --> 01:27:21,768
You're acting too smart. I will. . .

1103
01:27:23,375 --> 01:27:24,569
Are you crazy?

1104
01:27:24,655 --> 01:27:26,930
What are you doing?

1105
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:28,928
Move.

1106
01:27:29,015 --> 01:27:30,368
You thrashed my brother.

1107
01:27:32,175 --> 01:27:33,927
You thrashed my brother.

1108
01:27:34,775 --> 01:27:36,493
You thrashed my brother.

1109
01:27:36,575 --> 01:27:38,327
Brother. Brother.

1110
01:27:50,175 --> 01:27:53,531
Brother, call the police. Help me, brother.

1111
01:27:53,615 --> 01:27:55,287
Birju, leave me.

1112
01:27:57,895 --> 01:28:00,887
Hello, police station. This is Rana Mahendra Pratap.

1113
01:28:14,175 --> 01:28:17,087
Inspector, look what he has done to my brother.

1114
01:28:17,255 --> 01:28:19,052
Take this beast, and put him in the lock-up.

1115
01:28:19,135 --> 01:28:21,046
You're a beast, a bloody beast.

1116
01:28:21,695 --> 01:28:24,289
Come to your senses. Come to your senses.

1117
01:28:26,295 --> 01:28:30,732
You don't know. He thrashed my brother.

1118
01:28:32,415 --> 01:28:35,532
He left him bleeding.

1119
01:28:37,255 --> 01:28:41,134
I won't spare him. I won't.

1120
01:28:41,335 --> 01:28:44,327
Get lost. What harm will you bring to me, you madman?

1121
01:28:44,415 --> 01:28:47,532
Then hear this madman loud and clear, Rana.

1122
01:28:48,655 --> 01:28:53,445
If I don't get your sister married to my brother. . .

1123
01:28:54,335 --> 01:28:57,725
. . .then shame befall Birju's name.

1124
01:28:59,575 --> 01:29:01,691
Before your brother marries my sister. . .

1125
01:29:01,775 --> 01:29:04,164
. . .I'll shred your brother to pieces.

1126
01:29:04,255 --> 01:29:07,327
Forget shredding to pieces. . .

1127
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:11,290
. . .If as much as touch my brother. . .

1128
01:29:11,615 --> 01:29:19,249
. . .I'll won't leave you worthy enough of being called a man.

1129
01:29:25,078 --> 01:29:31,517
I still don't understand who thrashed Raja so badly.

1130
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:34,237
Once I find out who it is. . .

1131
01:29:34,318 --> 01:29:39,790
. . .I swear I'll knock the shining daylights out of him.

1132
01:29:39,878 --> 01:29:42,312
Well done. - Abdul. Abdul.

1133
01:29:42,398 --> 01:29:44,309
Uncle. - What happened to him?

1134
01:29:44,398 --> 01:29:46,866
There's terrible news. - What happened?

1135
01:29:47,518 --> 01:29:48,746
What happened?

1136
01:29:48,838 --> 01:29:52,877
The police arrested Birju. He is in the lock up.

1137
01:29:52,958 --> 01:29:54,437
What are you saying? - Yes.

1138
01:29:54,518 --> 01:29:56,793
What are you saying? That's bad news.

1139
01:29:56,958 --> 01:30:00,587
So, Raja shouldn't find out.

1140
01:30:00,678 --> 01:30:03,033
Otherwise his health could deteriorate. - Yes.

1141
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:06,713
But how to release Birju from the lock-up?

1142
01:30:06,798 --> 01:30:09,995
The inspector asks for a bail amount of Rs. 15000.

1143
01:30:10,078 --> 01:30:12,353
I won't let him get a bail, Mr. Rana.

1144
01:30:12,438 --> 01:30:14,827
For nothing in the world.

1145
01:30:14,918 --> 01:30:17,307
Shame on me if I don't break as many bones of his body. . .

1146
01:30:17,398 --> 01:30:23,189
. . .as the broken glasses in your mansion.

1147
01:30:23,478 --> 01:30:25,673
You talk of six months, sir?

1148
01:30:25,758 --> 01:30:29,068
I can easily leave him to rot in there for a few years.

1149
01:30:29,438 --> 01:30:31,952
Yes, sir. I've received your bundle.

1150
01:30:32,078 --> 01:30:34,751
Now my job begins. Good day, sir.

1151
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:39,307
Hello, sir.

1152
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:43,195
Divide this among yourselves. The rest is mine.

1153
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:46,788
That is fine, sir. But we shouldn't keep it here.

1154
01:30:47,158 --> 01:30:48,796
I've received confirmed news. . .

1155
01:30:48,878 --> 01:30:51,472
. . .that anti-corruption officers are going to raid this place.

1156
01:30:51,558 --> 01:30:54,391
If we are caught with the bribe money. . .

1157
01:30:54,478 --> 01:30:56,514
. . .then our jobs would be at risk, sir.

1158
01:30:56,798 --> 01:30:57,947
Sir, do something.

1159
01:30:58,038 --> 01:30:59,835
I suggest you deliver this money to my home.

1160
01:30:59,918 --> 01:31:01,795
Hang on. - What happened?

1161
01:31:01,878 --> 01:31:03,516
Come here.

1162
01:31:03,878 --> 01:31:05,470
Tell me quickly. What is it? Tell me.

1163
01:31:05,558 --> 01:31:09,471
Sir, give me your hand. - Why? Are you an astrologer?

1164
01:31:09,558 --> 01:31:11,514
Sir, give me your hand. Please.

1165
01:31:11,598 --> 01:31:13,953
Here. See this. See this properly.

1166
01:31:14,038 --> 01:31:16,268
It's the same hand I'm going to thrash you with.

1167
01:31:16,358 --> 01:31:18,349
Nice hand. You have five fingers.

1168
01:31:21,638 --> 01:31:23,629
Leave me. Leave me.

1169
01:31:23,718 --> 01:31:28,075
Leave my hand. Help. Help.

1170
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:31,076
Divide the money later. - Come.

1171
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:32,386
Help.

1172
01:31:32,838 --> 01:31:34,066
Leave.

1173
01:31:35,398 --> 01:31:38,151
Liked it? Thrash me, will you?

1174
01:31:38,318 --> 01:31:40,707
My stick. Pandey, get my stick.

1175
01:31:40,798 --> 01:31:43,471
Open the door. - Beware.

1176
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:45,637
Nobody moves.

1177
01:31:45,718 --> 01:31:47,629
We've come from the anti-corruption bureau.

1178
01:31:48,438 --> 01:31:49,666
Come. Come, sir.

1179
01:31:49,758 --> 01:31:52,226
You won't find any corrupt officer in this police station.

1180
01:31:52,318 --> 01:31:54,627
Everybody here is honest.

1181
01:31:54,718 --> 01:32:00,156
Don't listen to him. This man must have been born on a bribe.

1182
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:01,591
Don't spare him.

1183
01:32:02,838 --> 01:32:06,228
Shut up. We know what we have to do.

1184
01:32:06,318 --> 01:32:07,831
Got it?

1185
01:32:08,838 --> 01:32:11,830
Frisk him.

1186
01:32:29,598 --> 01:32:33,068
Found it. Found it. Found it.

1187
01:32:33,358 --> 01:32:35,588
Tell me. Tell me, how we should punish you?

1188
01:32:35,678 --> 01:32:39,387
Sir, tie him up and pour molasses all over his body.

1189
01:32:39,478 --> 01:32:42,868
So that ants eat him bit by bit.

1190
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:46,110
Sir, forgive me. I'll never make this mistake again.

1191
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:47,756
I'll do as you say.

1192
01:32:47,838 --> 01:32:50,796
Release that innocent man. - Okay. Okay.

1193
01:32:50,878 --> 01:32:52,834
Harpal. - Yes. - Open the door quickly.

1194
01:32:52,918 --> 01:32:57,116
And bring Mr. Birju out. - Right away.

1195
01:32:57,518 --> 01:33:00,078
Beware. Nobody moves.

1196
01:33:00,398 --> 01:33:02,150
Everybody stands still.

1197
01:33:02,358 --> 01:33:03,950
But who are you?

1198
01:33:04,198 --> 01:33:05,870
We're from the anti-corruption bureau.

1199
01:33:06,518 --> 01:33:08,076
Anti-corruption bureau?

1200
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:26,150
What's going on here?

1201
01:33:26,238 --> 01:33:30,151
Leave him, sir. He's innocent. - Quiet.

1202
01:33:30,558 --> 01:33:32,310
Who are you all? Why are you all wailing?

1203
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:36,277
Sir, he locked that man up without a reason.

1204
01:33:36,358 --> 01:33:39,031
He asked for a bribe of Rs. 50000 to release him.

1205
01:33:39,118 --> 01:33:40,471
We have paid him Rs. 50000. - Yes.

1206
01:33:40,558 --> 01:33:42,116
Now he wants Rs. 7 5000.

1207
01:33:42,198 --> 01:33:43,677
Sir, they are lying. I. . .

1208
01:33:43,758 --> 01:33:45,396
Tell me. From where did you get this money?

1209
01:33:45,478 --> 01:33:47,389
I am telling you the truth. This is not bribe money. I will. . .

1210
01:33:47,478 --> 01:33:49,469
Shut up. Gaitonde. - Sir.

1211
01:33:49,558 --> 01:33:51,116
Tape his mouth. - Yes, sir.

1212
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:52,267
Constable. - Yes, sir.

1213
01:33:52,358 --> 01:33:53,427
Release that innocent man.

1214
01:33:56,838 --> 01:34:00,069
Thanks a ton, sir. Thanks a ton. . .

1215
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:02,228
. . .for having released this poor man.

1216
01:34:02,318 --> 01:34:03,717
Thank you, sir. - It's okay.

1217
01:34:03,798 --> 01:34:05,868
Sir, may I take my money? - Take it.

1218
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:08,631
Give it to me.

1219
01:34:09,038 --> 01:34:10,596
Thank you, sir. Come on.

1220
01:34:10,678 --> 01:34:11,793
Thank you, sir.

1221
01:34:13,518 --> 01:34:16,351
I'll handle this bribe taker.

1222
01:34:18,358 --> 01:34:20,076
Raja. Raja.

1223
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:24,916
Raja, are you okay?

1224
01:34:25,158 --> 01:34:28,309
I'm fine, brother. But you shouldn't have gone there.

1225
01:34:28,918 --> 01:34:29,953
What if something had happened to you?

1226
01:34:30,038 --> 01:34:31,630
Nothing will happen to me, Raja.

1227
01:34:31,718 --> 01:34:34,073
Those rogues will have to pay a price.

1228
01:34:34,158 --> 01:34:36,388
No, brother. This is my battle.

1229
01:34:36,478 --> 01:34:37,831
No, this is our battle.

1230
01:34:38,118 --> 01:34:39,597
Don't be stupid, both of you.

1231
01:34:39,998 --> 01:34:43,468
They have money, power and men.

1232
01:34:43,638 --> 01:34:45,151
You can't defeat them.

1233
01:34:45,238 --> 01:34:48,230
We will win, Aunt. We surely will.

1234
01:34:48,438 --> 01:34:52,192
By hook or by crook.

1235
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:54,946
With all due respect, sir.

1236
01:34:55,038 --> 01:34:59,907
I proudly say that you did the right thing with Raja.

1237
01:34:59,998 --> 01:35:03,149
And that madman was making tall claims.

1238
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:06,548
Just watch. Now he'll never come here.

1239
01:35:06,638 --> 01:35:08,549
May I come in please?

1240
01:35:10,998 --> 01:35:13,466
Think of the devil and the devil is here.

1241
01:35:13,918 --> 01:35:15,237
Good morning.

1242
01:35:15,318 --> 01:35:19,834
Rogue, how dare you come inside? Get out.

1243
01:35:20,598 --> 01:35:23,396
Looks like you were born on Diwali ( festival of lights ).

1244
01:35:23,478 --> 01:35:25,912
You explode like a firecracker before you speak.

1245
01:35:25,998 --> 01:35:28,990
You. . . - Don't beat me. I have not come here to fight.

1246
01:35:29,078 --> 01:35:32,229
I've come with the invitation card for Raja's wedding.

1247
01:35:33,278 --> 01:35:34,506
Hello.

1248
01:35:34,718 --> 01:35:38,427
You look like a lunatic, but you're quite sensible.

1249
01:35:38,598 --> 01:35:39,872
Come.

1250
01:35:40,438 --> 01:35:43,111
Good that you arranged your brother's alliance elsewhere.

1251
01:35:43,278 --> 01:35:45,792
Sukhiram, bring almond sherbet for him.

1252
01:35:45,878 --> 01:35:47,357
With some saffron.

1253
01:35:47,758 --> 01:35:48,986
Yes, add saffron too.

1254
01:35:49,078 --> 01:35:51,717
Tell me. Where's the girl?

1255
01:35:51,958 --> 01:35:53,357
She is from this city. - Okay.

1256
01:35:53,438 --> 01:35:56,748
With your blessings, I have fixed the alliance with a rich family.

1257
01:35:56,838 --> 01:35:58,510
I see. - Read it for yourself.

1258
01:35:59,318 --> 01:36:01,036
Wow!

1259
01:36:03,318 --> 01:36:07,675
Birju, the kiteseller invites you to his younger brother, Raja's wedding. .

1260
01:36:07,758 --> 01:36:11,433
. . .with Madhu, sister of Mr. Mahendra Pratap Garhwal.

1261
01:36:13,998 --> 01:36:18,469
You rogue, how dare you do this?

1262
01:36:18,558 --> 01:36:22,153
It is customary to give the in-laws the first invite.

1263
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:26,390
You dare form an alliance with us? With us?

1264
01:36:26,558 --> 01:36:28,674
You can't leave from here alive.

1265
01:36:31,158 --> 01:36:32,876
I won't spare you.

1266
01:36:34,438 --> 01:36:37,589
Good. Good. Shoot me.

1267
01:36:37,678 --> 01:36:40,511
You'll only make things easier for me. Shoot me.

1268
01:36:40,598 --> 01:36:44,432
You fool, how will dying make things easier for you?

1269
01:36:44,678 --> 01:36:47,067
You fool, you don't understand.

1270
01:36:47,158 --> 01:36:49,194
If he shoots me, I'll die.

1271
01:36:49,278 --> 01:36:52,429
If I die, they'll be hanged.

1272
01:36:52,518 --> 01:36:54,827
Then there's no stopping Madhu and Raja.

1273
01:36:54,918 --> 01:36:56,715
Shoot me. Shoot me. Shoot.

1274
01:36:56,798 --> 01:37:00,632
He's right, sir. Don't shoot. - Shoot.

1275
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:04,158
No. No. - Don't shoot.

1276
01:37:04,358 --> 01:37:05,552
Don't shoot. - Move.

1277
01:37:05,878 --> 01:37:07,596
Don't shoot. - Move.

1278
01:37:07,678 --> 01:37:10,192
Come here. Don't shoot.

1279
01:37:10,838 --> 01:37:13,716
Rana, don't shoot. Rana, don't shoot.

1280
01:37:13,798 --> 01:37:16,312
Rana, don't shoot. Rana, don't shoot.

1281
01:37:16,478 --> 01:37:19,197
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1282
01:37:19,278 --> 01:37:22,076
Don't shoot. Rana, don't shoot.

1283
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:23,750
Rana, don't shoot.

1284
01:37:29,798 --> 01:37:32,631
Try to understand, sir. He's right.

1285
01:37:32,958 --> 01:37:36,030
He has done half the task by printing the wedding card. . .

1286
01:37:36,118 --> 01:37:38,916
. . .and the rest will be done after you're hanged.

1287
01:37:39,438 --> 01:37:40,951
Good you didn't shoot him.

1288
01:37:43,078 --> 01:37:45,194
You're the only intelligent one among them.

1289
01:37:46,078 --> 01:37:48,034
The rest of them are all morons.

1290
01:37:48,798 --> 01:37:49,947
You stupid fellow.

1291
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:51,796
Yes, Brother Birju. - Come here.

1292
01:37:54,918 --> 01:37:58,877
Look, I don't know about them.

1293
01:37:58,958 --> 01:38:02,348
But at least you look like a human being.

1294
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:06,109
I will give you some free advice. Follow it.

1295
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:09,028
Forget Madhu.

1296
01:38:10,838 --> 01:38:13,033
Otherwise I will make your plight such that. . .

1297
01:38:13,118 --> 01:38:17,589
. . .you won't be able to call yourself a man.

1298
01:38:20,358 --> 01:38:23,589
Mr. Vishwa, I'm leaving.

1299
01:38:24,598 --> 01:38:30,355
Mr. Rana, see you on 25th of October. . .

1300
01:38:30,438 --> 01:38:32,906
. . .at Hanuman street, Pasta lane. Bye.

1301
01:38:34,718 --> 01:38:39,667
Brother, he comes to our house and threatens us.

1302
01:38:39,758 --> 01:38:41,510
I beg your pardon, sir.

1303
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,755
You should never underestimate your enemy.

1304
01:38:43,838 --> 01:38:45,032
This madman can do anything.

1305
01:38:45,118 --> 01:38:47,473
Mr. Rana, uncle is right.

1306
01:38:47,558 --> 01:38:49,674
There are still 25 days left for 25th October.

1307
01:38:49,758 --> 01:38:52,511
And in these 25 days this madman can do anything.

1308
01:38:52,598 --> 01:38:55,510
So we'll hide Madhu somewhere for 25 days.

1309
01:38:55,598 --> 01:38:57,589
I have a bungalow 25 miles from Alibaug.

1310
01:38:57,678 --> 01:38:58,997
We'll take Madhu there.

1311
01:38:59,078 --> 01:39:02,309
And before 25th of October we'll get her married to him. - Yes.

1312
01:39:02,398 --> 01:39:05,435
Then we'll see what this madman can do.

1313
01:39:10,038 --> 01:39:11,869
Fine, Bhanwarlal.

1314
01:39:12,438 --> 01:39:16,750
Madhu will be in Alibaug by morning tomorrow.

1315
01:39:17,158 --> 01:39:18,273
Let's go.

1316
01:39:27,478 --> 01:39:29,230
Don't worry, sister-in-law.

1317
01:39:30,598 --> 01:39:32,873
Nobody can separate Madhu from Raja.

1318
01:39:35,598 --> 01:39:38,271
Leave me. - Shut up, Madhu. Sit quietly, Madhu.

1319
01:39:38,358 --> 01:39:39,586
Sit quietly. - No.

1320
01:39:39,678 --> 01:39:42,033
Sit quietly. - Nobody can separate me from Raja.

1321
01:39:42,118 --> 01:39:43,870
Shut up. - Leave my hand.

1322
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:46,916
Madhu, sit down. - No.

1323
01:39:46,998 --> 01:39:48,795
Sit down, Madhu. - Leave me. Leave me.

1324
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:51,154
Madhu, I'll hit you. Sit down.

1325
01:39:51,238 --> 01:39:52,512
Raja.

1326
01:39:54,598 --> 01:39:55,917
Raja.

1327
01:39:57,478 --> 01:39:59,833
Driver, buck up. Drive faster.

1328
01:40:08,998 --> 01:40:11,637
Left. Push left.

1329
01:40:14,598 --> 01:40:16,350
Right. Push right.

1330
01:40:17,038 --> 01:40:18,994
Faster. Faster.

1331
01:42:05,998 --> 01:42:09,434
Oh, God. The bus is stuck in mid-air.

1332
01:42:09,518 --> 01:42:11,668
It's hanging over a cliff. - Shut up.

1333
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:22,629
Madhu, relax. Relax.

1334
01:42:22,718 --> 01:42:24,436
Sit. Sit. I'm coming.

1335
01:42:33,158 --> 01:42:35,752
Raja. Raja. Raja.

1336
01:42:35,838 --> 01:42:37,829
No, Raja.

1337
01:42:38,118 --> 01:42:43,067
No. No. Come back. Come back.

1338
01:42:43,238 --> 01:42:44,876
Come back.

1339
01:42:45,558 --> 01:42:47,753
Come back.

1340
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:53,552
We're safe. We're safe.

1341
01:42:53,638 --> 01:42:55,230
The cliff is going to fall over the bus.

1342
01:42:55,318 --> 01:42:57,274
I mean, the bus is going to fall over the cliff. - No.

1343
01:42:57,358 --> 01:42:59,076
Let's leave quietly. Come on.

1344
01:42:59,158 --> 01:43:00,955
Where are both of you going? - We've reached Alibaug.

1345
01:43:01,038 --> 01:43:02,551
We've reached Alibaug. - Sit.

1346
01:43:02,838 --> 01:43:05,306
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1347
01:43:05,398 --> 01:43:06,831
Why are you tying us up? - Quiet.

1348
01:43:06,918 --> 01:43:08,351
What's the matter? - Quiet.

1349
01:43:08,438 --> 01:43:12,113
Leave us. - Raja. Raja.

1350
01:43:12,318 --> 01:43:14,036
Raja. Raja.

1351
01:43:14,638 --> 01:43:17,198
Raja. - I don't know why he has tied us up.

1352
01:43:17,598 --> 01:43:19,111
Don't go ahead.

1353
01:43:19,798 --> 01:43:22,631
No. - The bus will fall over.

1354
01:43:22,718 --> 01:43:25,186
Don't go ahead. Don't go ahead.

1355
01:43:28,438 --> 01:43:32,511
Saved. We're saved again.

1356
01:43:32,918 --> 01:43:34,670
He is tying the drape too. - Yes.

1357
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:36,710
Today he is tying everything. - Yes.

1358
01:43:36,798 --> 01:43:39,073
But why has he doing it? - I don't know.

1359
01:43:39,158 --> 01:43:41,752
What is he doing? What is he doing?

1360
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:43,949
Uncle, he is hanging upside down.

1361
01:43:44,198 --> 01:43:45,631
I think he is doing a circus trick.

1362
01:43:45,718 --> 01:43:48,516
But why is he doing it here?

1363
01:43:50,598 --> 01:43:52,828
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1364
01:43:53,158 --> 01:43:56,230
It's falling, nephew. The bus is going to fall again.

1365
01:43:56,398 --> 01:43:57,956
We're done for!

1366
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:00,950
We're going to die.

1367
01:44:02,718 --> 01:44:07,030
Saved. We're saved again. We're alive.

1368
01:44:07,998 --> 01:44:09,113
He's swinging again.

1369
01:44:12,038 --> 01:44:15,667
Raja, this bus. . . - What are you doing?

1370
01:44:24,798 --> 01:44:27,028
Saved. We're saved again.

1371
01:44:27,478 --> 01:44:29,275
We're saved again.

1372
01:44:31,558 --> 01:44:34,072
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1373
01:44:34,878 --> 01:44:36,948
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1374
01:44:42,438 --> 01:44:43,553
Let's go, Madhu.

1375
01:44:43,638 --> 01:44:46,516
He's released the girl. Now he will release us too.

1376
01:44:46,598 --> 01:44:48,475
Where are you going?

1377
01:44:48,558 --> 01:44:52,153
Raja, release me. God will bless you.

1378
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:54,672
Release me. - Me too. - Release you? - Yes.

1379
01:44:54,758 --> 01:44:56,350
But I'll release only one person.

1380
01:44:56,438 --> 01:44:57,951
Release me. - No. Me.

1381
01:44:58,038 --> 01:44:59,835
Release me. I'm elder to you.

1382
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:01,271
I'm elder to you. - Shut up. Shut up.

1383
01:45:01,358 --> 01:45:02,837
Shut up. - Shut up.

1384
01:45:02,998 --> 01:45:05,592
We'll take a stroll while you decide.

1385
01:45:05,678 --> 01:45:06,952
Let's go, Madhu darling. - Come.

1386
01:45:08,718 --> 01:45:09,867
Carefully.

1387
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:11,869
He went away. All because of you.

1388
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:14,313
Because of you. - Because of you. - Fool. - You're a fool.

1389
01:45:14,398 --> 01:45:15,751
Shut up. You.

1390
01:45:16,798 --> 01:45:17,992
Listen. - What happened?

1391
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:20,512
Where's this bus headed to? - To hell.

1392
01:45:20,598 --> 01:45:23,271
Fine. I'll get down one stop before.

1393
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:26,313
Don't get in. Don't get into the bus.

1394
01:45:26,398 --> 01:45:28,832
Hey, blind man. Don't.

1395
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:32,031
Why not? Do you own this bus that you're stopping me?

1396
01:45:32,118 --> 01:45:34,757
I'll surely travel in it. I surely will.

1397
01:45:35,038 --> 01:45:37,029
Fool. - I'll surely travel in it.

1398
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:40,713
Do you own this bus? - Don't go there. Don't go there.

1399
01:45:42,598 --> 01:45:44,111
Fool.

1400
01:45:50,758 --> 01:45:53,033
Is this a bus or a boat?

1401
01:45:53,278 --> 01:45:55,428
Come to this side. Come to this side.

1402
01:46:38,758 --> 01:46:41,716
I think even God doesn't want us to separate.

1403
01:46:42,078 --> 01:46:44,956
Okay. I'll sleep beside you.

1404
01:48:23,278 --> 01:48:23,915

1455
01:53:50,118 --> 01:53:54,509
Do you willingly accept each other as man and wife?

1456
01:53:54,598 --> 01:53:55,747
Yes. - Yes.

1457
01:53:55,838 --> 01:53:58,113
Okay. Both of you sign here.

1458
01:53:58,638 --> 01:53:59,548
Wait.

1459
01:54:15,358 --> 01:54:19,670
Brijnath, don't think that I've come to stop this marriage.

1460
01:54:21,238 --> 01:54:24,833
I've no objections to this marriage.

1461
01:54:28,918 --> 01:54:31,876
I always wished for my sister's happiness, Raja.

1462
01:54:32,438 --> 01:54:34,474
If her happiness lies in you then. . .

1463
01:54:34,558 --> 01:54:37,072
. . .I'll never come in the way of her joys.

1464
01:54:37,598 --> 01:54:39,509
My blessings are with you both.

1465
01:54:42,478 --> 01:54:44,434
I have just one request, Brijnath.

1466
01:54:45,478 --> 01:54:47,867
I raised my sister like a daughter.

1467
01:54:48,598 --> 01:54:52,034
I've always dreamt of the day she gets married.

1468
01:54:52,678 --> 01:54:55,272
If you allow that sister to leave for her in-law's house. . .

1469
01:54:55,358 --> 01:54:57,076
. . .from her brother's house instead of the court. . .

1470
01:54:57,478 --> 01:55:00,356
. . .then it will be a huge favour on me.

1471
01:55:00,678 --> 01:55:02,270
A huge favour.

1472
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:08,226
Mr. Rana, look. We didn't intent to hurt your feelings.

1473
01:55:08,638 --> 01:55:13,348
Forget whatever happened. I'll surely honour your wish.

1474
01:55:13,758 --> 01:55:16,431
Madhu's wedding procession will leave from your house.

1475
01:55:17,798 --> 01:55:20,870
I will forever remain indebted to you, Brijnath.

1476
01:55:21,518 --> 01:55:24,476
I'll remain indebted to you forever. - Mr. Rana.

1477
01:55:26,518 --> 01:55:27,792
Brother.

1478
01:55:35,118 --> 01:55:36,517
What have you done, brother?

1479
01:55:36,598 --> 01:55:39,237
You fell at their feet who are worth nothing.

1480
01:55:39,318 --> 01:55:40,751
What has happened to you?

1481
01:55:41,078 --> 01:55:45,435
Mr. Rana, don't forget that you have taken a loan worth millions. . .

1482
01:55:45,518 --> 01:55:47,907
. . .from me to save your business from going bankrupt.

1483
01:55:47,998 --> 01:55:51,195
You've promised me Madhu's hand in marriage.

1484
01:55:51,278 --> 01:55:55,954
If that didn't happen then the unimaginable would happen.

1485
01:55:56,038 --> 01:55:57,551
Are you people done?

1486
01:55:58,358 --> 01:55:59,552
Now listen to me.

1487
01:56:00,278 --> 01:56:02,189
What do you people think? I have bowed down to them?

1488
01:56:02,798 --> 01:56:04,026
No, Vishwa.

1489
01:56:04,558 --> 01:56:07,436
I've bowed down so that I can get rid of them forever.

1490
01:56:08,838 --> 01:56:11,716
I have disarmed the enemy by winning his trust.

1491
01:56:12,758 --> 01:56:14,953
Now watch how I attack him.

1492
01:57:24,278 --> 01:57:26,473
''At times I lock eyes. At times I steal a glance. ''

1493
01:57:26,558 --> 01:57:29,356

02:01:59,318 --> 02:02:01,548
Mr. Rana, all this. . . What is this?

1544
02:02:01,638 --> 02:02:03,913
This is a humble auspicious gift from our side.

1545
02:02:03,998 --> 02:02:05,397
Please accept it.

1546
02:02:05,718 --> 02:02:07,117
No, Mr. Rana.

1547
02:02:08,798 --> 02:02:13,394
Rana sir, you've given us your honour. . .

1548
02:02:13,718 --> 02:02:16,755
. . .the treasure of your family.

1549
02:02:17,118 --> 02:02:19,188
There's nothing else that we want.

1550
02:02:19,278 --> 02:02:21,667
I'm proud of my sister's choice.

1551
02:02:22,198 --> 02:02:23,790
She has chosen a family. . .

1552
02:02:24,038 --> 02:02:27,553
. . .that has contentment and values.

1553
02:02:27,678 --> 02:02:29,828
You are talking about money. . .

1554
02:02:29,918 --> 02:02:32,386
. . . but I'm sure to go bankrupt.

1555
02:02:32,478 --> 02:02:33,752
Greetings, Mr. Rana. - Greetings.

1556
02:02:33,838 --> 02:02:35,396
What's wrong, Ranglani. You look worried?

1557
02:02:35,478 --> 02:02:38,276
The problem is, the cheque of one million. . .

1558
02:02:38,358 --> 02:02:40,553
. . .the Sitanagar party gave us, has bounced.

1559
02:02:40,638 --> 02:02:42,151
I've tried calling them so many times since morning.

1560
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:43,830
But they refuse to talk to me.

1561
02:02:43,918 --> 02:02:45,351
I think something is wrong.

1562
02:02:45,438 --> 02:02:49,067
Raja. You'll have to go to Sitanagar by this evening's train.

1563
02:02:49,158 --> 02:02:52,070
But Mr. Ranglani, I can't leave my brother alone.

1564
02:02:52,158 --> 02:02:53,876
It's just a matter of two days.

1565
02:02:53,958 --> 02:02:55,914
You don't have to separate forever.

1566
02:02:55,998 --> 02:02:57,875
But try to understand.

1567
02:02:57,958 --> 02:03:00,153
There's no one to look after brother, except for me.

1568
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:02,069
What are you saying, Raja?

1569
02:03:02,238 --> 02:03:03,591
We are there for him.

1570
02:03:03,838 --> 02:03:06,955
If our relative stays with us for two days. . .

1571
02:03:07,198 --> 02:03:09,666
. . .then we'll get a chance to show our hospitality.

1572
02:03:09,758 --> 02:03:11,510
Isn't it, Madhu? - Yes, brother is right.

1573
02:03:11,598 --> 02:03:14,431
Madhu, you don't know. . . - No ifs and buts, Raja.

1574
02:03:14,558 --> 02:03:15,673
Go, and get ready to go.

1575
02:03:15,758 --> 02:03:17,589
Go Madhu, take him. - Let's go, Raja.

1576
02:03:23,198 --> 02:03:25,473
I've cleared your path, sir.

1577
02:03:25,638 --> 02:03:27,754
He's all yours, pounce on the prey.

1578
02:03:40,118 --> 02:03:43,428
Greetings, Mr. Rana. - Come Natwar, we've been waiting for you.

1579
02:03:43,598 --> 02:03:47,511
Brother, can he do what we want him to?

1580
02:03:47,998 --> 02:03:50,193
You don't believe me, sir.

1581
02:03:50,478 --> 02:03:52,787
I give you a small demonstration.

1582
02:03:56,558 --> 02:03:59,994
Look Raja, don't irritate me.

1583
02:04:00,078 --> 02:04:03,957
If I get angry, I'll slap you.

1584
02:04:04,038 --> 02:04:06,233
Amazing, brother. Simply amazing.

1585
02:04:06,318 --> 02:04:08,195
You've found a wonderful artist.

1586
02:04:08,878 --> 02:04:10,197
Listen, Natwar. - Yes.

1587
02:04:10,278 --> 02:04:14,191
If you do our job properly, I'll reward your handsomely.

1588
02:04:15,558 --> 02:04:18,948
But remember one thing, don't cross your limits. . .

1589
02:04:19,158 --> 02:04:21,388
. . . because that girl is my sister.

1590
02:04:21,558 --> 02:04:25,597
Have faith in me, Mr. Rana. Your job will be done.

1591
02:04:26,038 --> 02:04:28,427
And that madman, will be sent to the mental asylum.

1592
02:04:28,518 --> 02:04:29,667
Bravo.

1593
02:04:34,878 --> 02:04:36,709
You. What are you doing here?

1594
02:04:36,878 --> 02:04:38,516
I've heard everything. . .

1595
02:04:38,758 --> 02:04:40,669
. . .and now I understand everything as well.

1596
02:04:41,198 --> 02:04:43,996
The compromise that you made with Birju. . .

1597
02:04:44,238 --> 02:04:45,876
. . .was just a fraud.

1598
02:04:46,038 --> 02:04:49,235
But I won't let you stoop so low.

1599
02:04:49,478 --> 02:04:51,787
I'll tell Madhu everything right away.

1600
02:04:51,878 --> 02:04:55,632
Beware, if you dare open your mouth. . .

1601
02:04:55,918 --> 02:04:58,637
. . .then you'll lose your husband. - No.

1602
02:04:58,798 --> 02:05:01,107
Then keep your trap shut, okay?

1603
02:05:07,678 --> 02:05:08,997
Now go to sleep.

1604
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:11,507
And call me if you need anything.

1605
02:05:13,398 --> 02:05:14,592
Madhu. Madhu.

1606
02:05:15,758 --> 02:05:17,350
I'm very scared of thunder.

1607
02:05:18,398 --> 02:05:20,070
I'm very scared of thunder.

1608
02:05:21,478 --> 02:05:22,831
There's no need to be scared.

1609
02:05:22,918 --> 02:05:24,237
Go to sleep. You'll be absolutely fine.

1610
02:05:24,318 --> 02:05:25,831
Relax. Go to sleep.

1611
02:05:28,878 --> 02:05:31,597
Don't leave me alone. - Fine, I'll sit here.

1612
02:05:31,678 --> 02:05:33,077
Look, I am sitting right here.

1613
02:05:33,158 --> 02:05:35,114
You sleep. Okay, sleep.

1614
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:17,869
Who. . . who are you?

1615
02:07:18,078 --> 02:07:22,515
I. . . it's me, Birju. Birju.

1616
02:07:24,958 --> 02:07:26,471
Oh, my God.

1617
02:07:26,678 --> 02:07:28,191
You scared me.

1618
02:07:28,958 --> 02:07:31,518
What are you doing here? Go and sleep in your room.

1619
02:07:31,598 --> 02:07:32,826
I'm scared.

1620
02:07:32,918 --> 02:07:34,829
I said, go and sleep in your room.

1621
02:07:34,918 --> 02:07:37,113
I said I feel scared.

1622
02:07:38,318 --> 02:07:42,277
Madhu, I really like you.

1623
02:07:42,718 --> 02:07:45,073
Birju. What are you doing?

1624
02:07:45,198 --> 02:07:47,473
Come close to me. Come closer. - No.

1625
02:07:49,038 --> 02:07:50,994
What are you doing? Birju.

1626
02:07:51,078 --> 02:07:55,196
I. . . want to. . . touch you. . .

1627
02:07:58,638 --> 02:07:59,787
Madhu. . .

1628
02:08:01,918 --> 02:08:05,354
I want to kiss you. - Leave me.

1629
02:08:13,398 --> 02:08:14,831
No!

1630
02:08:16,358 --> 02:08:17,791
Brother.

1631
02:08:18,998 --> 02:08:20,397
Brother.

1632
02:08:22,318 --> 02:08:23,910
Leave me.

1633
02:08:24,598 --> 02:08:25,997
Brother.

1634
02:08:29,038 --> 02:08:30,596
Leave me.

1635
02:08:31,318 --> 02:08:32,990
Help!

1636
02:08:35,358 --> 02:08:36,996
Help!

1637
02:08:40,398 --> 02:08:41,911
Leave me.

1638
02:08:43,318 --> 02:08:44,592
Brother.

1639
02:08:46,038 --> 02:08:47,187
No.

1640
02:08:48,398 --> 02:08:49,547
Leave me.

1641
02:08:52,798 --> 02:08:53,992
Madhu.

1642
02:09:07,918 --> 02:09:09,146
Madhu.

1643
02:09:10,278 --> 02:09:12,189
Madhu. . . - Brother. . .

1644
02:09:12,918 --> 02:09:14,146
Madhu. . .

1645
02:09:14,478 --> 02:09:15,991
Brother. . . - Madhu was. . .

1646
02:09:16,518 --> 02:09:20,306
Brother, he. . . he. . . Brother.

1647
02:09:20,958 --> 02:09:23,233
He. . . he. . . brother.

1648
02:09:25,078 --> 02:09:29,469
Under the guise of insanity. . .

1649
02:09:29,558 --> 02:09:31,628
. . .you tried to tarnish the honour of your sister-in-law!

1650
02:09:31,838 --> 02:09:36,229
Madhu, I didn't. He escaped from the window.

1651
02:09:36,318 --> 02:09:38,548
I saved her. - Dare you lie.

1652
02:09:40,358 --> 02:09:42,030
I won't spare you. - Madhu.

1653
02:09:42,478 --> 02:09:43,831
You scoundrel.

1654
02:09:43,918 --> 02:09:44,987
Come on. - No.

1655
02:09:45,078 --> 02:09:46,147
Acting smart.

1656
02:10:11,958 --> 02:10:13,471
Do you want to kill him?

1657
02:10:13,958 --> 02:10:17,030
Birju. - Sister-in-law, help me.

1658
02:10:17,878 --> 02:10:21,712
You scoundrel, you fake your insanity, and beg for mercy.

1659
02:10:22,198 --> 02:10:24,393
I beg of you, leave him.

1660
02:10:24,478 --> 02:10:26,070
Sister-in-law, back off.

1661
02:10:26,158 --> 02:10:30,515
You rascal. Call the mental asylum. - No.

1662
02:10:30,598 --> 02:10:33,192
Ask them to take him away. Rascal.

1663
02:10:33,478 --> 02:10:35,946
Dr. Sinha, this is Mahendra Pratap speaking.

1664
02:10:36,278 --> 02:10:38,394
There's a madman in our house, creating a havoc.

1665
02:10:38,478 --> 02:10:39,797
Please come quickly and take him away.

1666
02:10:51,478 --> 02:10:54,914
Get up, get up. Take him away.

1667
02:10:55,838 --> 02:10:59,274
Take him away. - Madhu. Madhu.

1668
02:10:59,838 --> 02:11:03,626
I'm not the culprit. Don't send me to the asylum.

1669
02:11:03,718 --> 02:11:06,391
Don't send me to the asylum.

1670
02:11:07,078 --> 02:11:09,797
Don't send me to the asylum.

1671
02:11:11,158 --> 02:11:13,877
Don't send me to the asylum.

1672
02:11:14,918 --> 02:11:16,556
No!

1673
02:11:16,638 --> 02:11:18,196
Madhu.

1674
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:20,836
Madhu.

1675
02:11:48,078 --> 02:11:50,387
Hi, Madhu. There you are.

1676
02:11:50,478 --> 02:11:52,116
And I've been looking for you all over the house.

1677
02:11:54,158 --> 02:11:56,194
Look Madhu, what I got for you.

1678
02:11:59,158 --> 02:12:01,149
Actually, you don't get anything in Sitanagar.

1679
02:12:01,318 --> 02:12:03,195
But still, I bought a shawl for Mr. Rana. . .

1680
02:12:03,278 --> 02:12:05,109
. . .and sweater for brother Birju.

1681
02:12:05,558 --> 02:12:06,513
It'll look good on him, won't it?

1682
02:12:08,598 --> 02:12:10,031
But where is brother Birju?

1683
02:12:12,038 --> 02:12:13,630
Madhu, tell me where's brother Birju?

1684
02:12:21,478 --> 02:12:24,311
Why. . . why don't you'll tell me?

1685
02:12:25,238 --> 02:12:26,387
Where's brother Birju?

1686
02:12:28,078 --> 02:12:29,670
Tell me, where's brother Birju?

1687
02:12:32,198 --> 02:12:34,951
Madhu, why are you quiet?

1688
02:12:35,318 --> 02:12:36,831
Why don't you tell me where is brother Birju?

1689
02:12:39,398 --> 02:12:42,037
For God sake Madhu, tell me where's brother Birju?

1690
02:12:42,238 --> 02:12:43,148
I'll tell you.

1691
02:12:44,118 --> 02:12:46,552
Your brother is in the mental asylum.

1692
02:12:59,078 --> 02:13:00,591
My brother is in the mental asylum, Madhu?

1693
02:13:10,438 --> 02:13:12,872
What? Who sent him?

1694
02:13:21,038 --> 02:13:23,836
Why did you send him to the mental asylum? Why did you send him?

1695
02:13:23,918 --> 02:13:25,636
He did something so cheap.

1696
02:13:26,198 --> 02:13:27,711
He tried to dishonour Madhu.

1697
02:13:31,718 --> 02:13:34,312
That's a lie. You dare accuse my brother.

1698
02:13:34,398 --> 02:13:35,672
That's a lie. - Have you gone crazy?

1699
02:13:35,758 --> 02:13:37,237
Tell me it's a lie.

1700
02:13:37,438 --> 02:13:39,998
Tell me it's a lie. Say it. - He has lost it.

1701
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:41,670
Tell me it's a lie. - What are you doing?

1702
02:13:41,758 --> 02:13:42,873
Rascal.

1703
02:13:44,238 --> 02:13:46,547
You dare accuse my brother.

1704
02:13:47,318 --> 02:13:49,036
You dare accuse my brother.

1705
02:13:49,238 --> 02:13:51,627
Tell me it's a lie. Tell me it's a lie.

1706
02:13:51,718 --> 02:13:52,946
Leave him.

1707
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:58,151
Every word of what my brother said is true.

1708
02:13:59,838 --> 02:14:03,433
The younger brother's wife is like a daughter.

1709
02:14:04,038 --> 02:14:06,711
But your brother tried to violate me.

1710
02:14:09,918 --> 02:14:13,308
That's. . . you. . . you are saying this, Madhu.

1711
02:14:13,398 --> 02:14:14,797
Yes, I am saying it.

1712
02:14:15,358 --> 02:14:19,476
Because I was the one who was victimised.

1713
02:14:22,838 --> 02:14:24,396
You are committing a sin.

1714
02:14:24,838 --> 02:14:28,547
By accusing a helpless man of such a crime, you are committing a sin.

1715
02:14:28,878 --> 02:14:30,630
The clouds can shower fire.

1716
02:14:30,878 --> 02:14:32,550
The earth can spew blood.

1717
02:14:32,638 --> 02:14:34,515
The moon and the stars can shatter into a million pieces.

1718
02:14:34,598 --> 02:14:38,910
But my brother. . . He can never do such a cheap thing, Madhu.

1719
02:14:39,078 --> 02:14:40,431
He can never do it.

1720
02:14:40,838 --> 02:14:43,796
I'm sure someone has conspired against him.

1721
02:14:45,398 --> 02:14:48,947
Don't you dare try accuse my brothers.

1722
02:14:50,078 --> 02:14:51,955
If the other day they hadn't come on time. . .

1723
02:14:52,438 --> 02:14:54,269
. . .then I could have never have faced you.

1724
02:14:56,838 --> 02:14:59,352
Now you must choose, Raja.

1725
02:14:59,798 --> 02:15:03,427
You'll have to choose me or your insane brother.

1726
02:15:08,278 --> 02:15:10,428
Don't you dare call my brother insane.

1727
02:15:11,278 --> 02:15:13,428
And if you want a decision, then listen.

1728
02:15:14,118 --> 02:15:17,713
I can forsake many girls like you for my brother. Get that.

1729
02:15:19,078 --> 02:15:20,955
Go, get lost.

1730
02:15:21,038 --> 02:15:23,313
I don't want to anything to do with you as well.

1731
02:15:23,758 --> 02:15:25,430
I hate you.

1732
02:15:25,958 --> 02:15:27,516
I hate you.

1733
02:15:28,078 --> 02:15:29,306
I hate you.

1734
02:15:37,638 --> 02:15:40,027
See Vishwa, the brilliance of my wit.

1735
02:15:41,438 --> 02:15:43,998
This love story has ended forever. . .

1736
02:15:44,278 --> 02:15:46,712
. . .and our sister has returned to us as well.

1737
02:16:02,598 --> 02:16:03,747
Brother Birju.

1738
02:16:04,318 --> 02:16:05,467
Brother Birju.

1739
02:16:10,238 --> 02:16:11,751
Brother Birju.

1740
02:16:12,198 --> 02:16:13,551
Brother Birju.

1741
02:16:24,558 --> 02:16:25,707
Brother Birju.

1742
02:16:30,638 --> 02:16:31,832
Raja.

1743
02:16:37,318 --> 02:16:38,592
Brother Birju.

1744
02:16:41,878 --> 02:16:43,106
Brother Birju.

1745
02:16:44,158 --> 02:16:46,433
They'll kill me.

1746
02:16:47,118 --> 02:16:49,268
Take me home, Raja.

1747
02:16:49,598 --> 02:16:51,509
Take me home.

1748
02:16:51,598 --> 02:16:53,634
Take me home.

1749
02:16:53,718 --> 02:16:55,390
You'll be absolutely fine, brother.

1750
02:16:55,638 --> 02:16:57,594
As long as I am there, you'll be absolutely fine.

1751
02:16:57,958 --> 02:17:03,316
Raja, I. . . didn't do anything to Madhu.

1752
02:17:03,398 --> 02:17:07,311
I know, brother. You could never stoop so low.

1753
02:17:07,838 --> 02:17:09,794
Those rascals have trapped you.

1754
02:17:10,438 --> 02:17:13,748
But now that I'm back, everything will be fine.

1755
02:17:13,958 --> 02:17:15,471
Everything will be fine.

1756
02:17:15,638 --> 02:17:17,310
Congratulations, sir.

1757
02:17:17,518 --> 02:17:20,191
I've heard that you've sent Birju to the mental asylum.

1758
02:17:20,518 --> 02:17:22,156
When will I get my reward?

1759
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:23,990
You'll surely be rewarded for this.

1760
02:17:24,078 --> 02:17:25,875
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1761
02:17:27,318 --> 02:17:28,717
Scoundrel ! - Raja, you.

1762
02:17:29,718 --> 02:17:32,027
You accused my brother.

1763
02:17:36,558 --> 02:17:39,026
Tell me. Tell me, what the truth is.

1764
02:17:39,398 --> 02:17:42,435
Tell me. - I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

1765
02:17:42,558 --> 02:17:44,788
Raja, I'll tell you the truth. Leave me.

1766
02:17:46,078 --> 02:17:48,273
Come on. Come, you rascal.

1767
02:17:48,358 --> 02:17:50,667
You'll have to admit your crime to Madhu.

1768
02:17:50,758 --> 02:17:52,874
Come on. Come on.

1769
02:17:55,878 --> 02:17:57,072
Come on.

1770
02:18:02,838 --> 02:18:05,989
Give me the keys. Give me the key. - I'm doing it.

1771
02:18:14,918 --> 02:18:16,954
Driver, push off.

1772
02:18:30,358 --> 02:18:31,677
Raja.

1773
02:18:37,678 --> 02:18:39,031
Raja.

1774
02:18:39,638 --> 02:18:40,787
Raja.

1775
02:18:42,878 --> 02:18:44,277
Raja, my brother.

1776
02:18:44,758 --> 02:18:45,747
Raja.

1777
02:18:49,518 --> 02:18:50,633
Raja, my brother.

1778
02:18:58,198 --> 02:18:59,551
Madhu.

1779
02:18:59,958 --> 02:19:02,518
Madhu. Madhu.

1780
02:19:03,078 --> 02:19:04,147
No. No. No.

1781
02:19:04,238 --> 02:19:06,877
Do you own this your house that you're barging in? Get lost.

1782
02:19:06,958 --> 02:19:09,233
I want to meet Madhu. My brother, Raja. . .

1783
02:19:09,758 --> 02:19:11,510
Madhu. Madhu.

1784
02:19:12,038 --> 02:19:13,391
Madhu. Madhu.

1785
02:19:13,478 --> 02:19:19,075
Save Raja. Save Raja. He has met with an accident.

1786
02:19:19,998 --> 02:19:23,274
Save him, Madhu. Save him.

1787
02:19:24,598 --> 02:19:26,395
Save him, Madhu.

1788
02:19:29,038 --> 02:19:31,188
Now I get why you have come here.

1789
02:19:33,078 --> 02:19:35,638
This is what has brought you here, right? Take this.

1790
02:19:35,878 --> 02:19:40,030
You can buy your brother's life with this money. Take it.

1791
02:19:45,878 --> 02:19:48,551
I didn't come here for money.

1792
02:19:49,398 --> 02:19:51,275
I have come to take you.

1793
02:19:51,838 --> 02:19:54,272
Raja wants to see you.

1794
02:19:54,678 --> 02:19:57,192
He is calling for you, Madhu.

1795
02:19:57,478 --> 02:20:00,788
He loves you. You're his life.

1796
02:20:00,878 --> 02:20:04,553
Come. Come, we don't have much time, Madhu. Come.

1797
02:20:04,918 --> 02:20:06,988
Come. - Leave me.

1798
02:20:07,558 --> 02:20:09,355
I have nothing to do with that man's life.

1799
02:20:09,438 --> 02:20:13,431
He has ruined my life.

1800
02:20:14,478 --> 02:20:17,754
Our relationship is over. Go away.

1801
02:20:17,838 --> 02:20:18,987
Madhu. - Go away.

1802
02:20:19,078 --> 02:20:21,467
Listen to me. - You madman, didn't you hear what my sister said?

1803
02:20:21,558 --> 02:20:22,832
Get lost. - Listen to me.

1804
02:20:22,918 --> 02:20:25,193
Get lost. Otherwise I'll break your bones. - Madhu. . .

1805
02:20:34,598 --> 02:20:36,953
You were his last hope.

1806
02:20:39,398 --> 02:20:41,514
You turned your face away.

1807
02:20:45,678 --> 02:20:47,873
Now where will I go?

1808
02:20:50,478 --> 02:20:52,309
What will I do?

1809
02:20:55,398 --> 02:20:57,309
Raja is going to die.

1810
02:21:00,558 --> 02:21:03,026
My brother is going to die.

1811
02:21:04,438 --> 02:21:06,998
Raja is going to die.

1812
02:21:09,798 --> 02:21:11,993
Raja is going to die.

1813
02:21:13,718 --> 02:21:15,629
Raja is going to die.

1814
02:21:17,598 --> 02:21:21,637
Well done, Madhu. Very good. You did the right thing.

1815
02:21:21,718 --> 02:21:25,677
You did the right thing by throwing him out.

1816
02:21:25,758 --> 02:21:27,589
This is what you should have done.

1817
02:21:27,678 --> 02:21:31,307
You have proved that you're their sister.

1818
02:21:31,398 --> 02:21:33,229
You all belong to the same bloodline.

1819
02:21:33,758 --> 02:21:36,670
Because the filthy blood that runs in their veins. . .

1820
02:21:36,838 --> 02:21:38,510
. . . is coursing through yours too.

1821
02:21:38,598 --> 02:21:40,828
Are you mad, Sumitra?

1822
02:21:40,998 --> 02:21:42,192
What nonsense are you talking?

1823
02:21:42,278 --> 02:21:43,836
I'm not talking nonsense.

1824
02:21:44,038 --> 02:21:48,236
I'm speaking the truth, so that she sees your true face. . .

1825
02:21:48,318 --> 02:21:50,195
. . .which is hidden behind the mask of decency.

1826
02:21:50,278 --> 02:21:52,314
Stop yourself.

1827
02:21:52,598 --> 02:21:56,193
Otherwise your marriage might be at stake.

1828
02:21:58,478 --> 02:22:02,710
Since the origin of the world. . .

1829
02:22:02,958 --> 02:22:05,347
. . . men have been threatening women with the same thing.

1830
02:22:05,598 --> 02:22:09,637
And poor women have been enduring it quietly.

1831
02:22:10,358 --> 02:22:13,316
You threaten me with this bond of marriage.

1832
02:22:14,798 --> 02:22:19,189
So today I free myself from this bond.

1833
02:22:21,038 --> 02:22:24,075
Now you can't stop me from telling the truth.

1834
02:22:24,758 --> 02:22:26,555
Madhu, you don't know.

1835
02:22:26,638 --> 02:22:30,187
Your brothers have plotted a conspiracy against you. - Sumitra.

1836
02:22:30,278 --> 02:22:33,031
You considered them your brothers. . .

1837
02:22:33,118 --> 02:22:36,554
. . .and they snatched your happiness.

1838
02:22:36,638 --> 02:22:39,106
Sumitra, if you utter another word. . .

1839
02:22:39,198 --> 02:22:41,234
. . .then I will chop you into pieces.

1840
02:22:41,318 --> 02:22:43,513
Do as you wish, Mahendra Pratap. Go ahead.

1841
02:22:43,918 --> 02:22:46,386
Today I am stronger than your sword.

1842
02:22:46,798 --> 02:22:49,596
If you have the guts bring it down on me. Come on.

1843
02:23:04,558 --> 02:23:05,991
Madhu, you don't know. . .

1844
02:23:06,078 --> 02:23:08,387
. . .to convert their defeat into victory. . .

1845
02:23:08,478 --> 02:23:10,787
. . .they arranged for you to marry Raja.

1846
02:23:10,998 --> 02:23:13,910
But it was all a farce. It was pretence.

1847
02:23:14,918 --> 02:23:18,627
That night not Birju but a goon. . .

1848
02:23:18,718 --> 02:23:22,154
. . . hired by your brothers tried to rape you.

1849
02:23:23,638 --> 02:23:24,912
Not just that.

1850
02:23:24,998 --> 02:23:30,026
They even tried to kill Raja to save themselves.

1851
02:23:30,118 --> 02:23:34,270
So that his death breaks the last link of your love.

1852
02:24:12,678 --> 02:24:17,388
Once, seeing how much you love me, I prayed to God. . .

1853
02:24:18,558 --> 02:24:21,356
. . .that in every life is be blessed with brothers like you.

1854
02:24:23,078 --> 02:24:28,391
But today after seeing your true form I pray to God. . .

1855
02:24:29,478 --> 02:24:35,553
. . .that no sister has brothers like you.

1856
02:24:42,118 --> 02:24:46,908
And for brothers like you I rejected my love.

1857
02:24:48,798 --> 02:24:51,915
No. I will go.

1858
02:24:52,958 --> 02:24:55,313
I will go to my Raja.

1859
02:25:07,718 --> 02:25:10,516
You won't leave this house.

1860
02:25:12,158 --> 02:25:16,071
Didn't you hear? You won't leave this house.

1861
02:25:16,998 --> 02:25:19,990
I will go. I will surely go.

1862
02:25:20,878 --> 02:25:22,914
Then your dead body would leave from this house.

1863
02:25:22,998 --> 02:25:24,795
Leave me. Leave me.

1864
02:25:30,078 --> 02:25:32,433
Brother. - Let her go, Vishwa.

1865
02:25:32,638 --> 02:25:34,629
What? Are you in your senses?

1866
02:25:34,838 --> 02:25:38,308
Yes. Today I've come to my senses.

1867
02:25:39,438 --> 02:25:41,906
Sumitra has opened my eyes.

1868
02:25:42,558 --> 02:25:45,436
She has made me realise all my mistakes.

1869
02:25:46,438 --> 02:25:48,110
Let her go. Let her go.

1870
02:25:48,198 --> 02:25:50,109
You might give up.

1871
02:25:50,198 --> 02:25:52,917
But I won't give up in the face of her obstinacy.

1872
02:25:52,998 --> 02:25:55,228
I won't let her go. - No, Vishwa.

1873
02:25:56,118 --> 02:25:59,827
Dare you stop her. Leave her.

1874
02:26:02,998 --> 02:26:07,867
Go, Madhu. Go far away from selfish brothers like us. . .

1875
02:26:08,518 --> 02:26:10,270
. . .and don't ever come back.

1876
02:26:12,758 --> 02:26:14,635
Go and settle down.

1877
02:26:15,598 --> 02:26:17,554
My blessings are with you.

1878
02:26:17,638 --> 02:26:20,106
Go, dear. Go.

1879
02:26:31,678 --> 02:26:36,752
No. - Brother.

1880
02:26:38,918 --> 02:26:41,830
No. - You were leaving, weren't you? Now leave.

1881
02:26:42,118 --> 02:26:43,312
Now let me see how you leave.

1882
02:26:43,398 --> 02:26:45,707
I will. I will surely go to my Raja.

1883
02:26:45,918 --> 02:26:47,033
You can shoot me if you want.

1884
02:26:47,118 --> 02:26:51,157
No. No. I won't kill you.

1885
02:26:51,598 --> 02:26:56,149
But I will make you forget that loafer.

1886
02:26:56,358 --> 02:26:59,589
Try. You will fail.

1887
02:27:00,078 --> 02:27:02,069
You challenge me?

1888
02:27:04,078 --> 02:27:06,546
Now take his name. - Raja.

1889
02:27:09,438 --> 02:27:10,632
Raja. - What?

1890
02:27:10,718 --> 02:27:12,948
Vishwa, leave her. Let her go. - Move.

1891
02:27:13,838 --> 02:27:16,557
Not just once, I will say it countless times.

1892
02:27:16,838 --> 02:27:18,430
Raja. Raja. Raja. Raja.

1893
02:27:18,518 --> 02:27:19,917
Move.

1894
02:27:23,998 --> 02:27:25,431
I won't spare you.

1895
02:27:25,638 --> 02:27:27,117
I will make your plight such that. . .

1896
02:27:27,198 --> 02:27:29,507
. . .you won't be able to take your lover's name.

1897
02:27:29,598 --> 02:27:31,793
God hasn't made men strong enough. . .

1898
02:27:31,878 --> 02:27:33,630
. . .to break a woman's resolution.

1899
02:27:33,718 --> 02:27:35,390
Today you too will witness this truth.

1900
02:27:35,478 --> 02:27:38,276
What? You dare argue with me?

1901
02:27:43,998 --> 02:27:45,954
Raja.

1902
02:27:46,118 --> 02:27:47,836
Madhu.

1903
02:28:04,558 --> 02:28:07,868
Tell me. Tell me. Will you take his name?

1904
02:28:47,038 --> 02:28:48,471
No.

1905
02:28:50,438 --> 02:28:53,714
Today I will burn the body in which his love. . .

1906
02:28:53,798 --> 02:28:55,470
. . . is coursing like blood.

1907
02:28:56,638 --> 02:28:59,596
I will set you ablaze.

1908
02:29:00,638 --> 02:29:02,549
I will set you ablaze.

1909
02:29:03,518 --> 02:29:05,270
I will set you ablaze.

1910
02:29:05,358 --> 02:29:07,667
No. - I will burn you.

1911
02:29:10,198 --> 02:29:11,267
Scoundrel.

1912
02:29:33,958 --> 02:29:35,516
You dare hit Madhu?

1913
02:29:57,718 --> 02:29:58,707
No.

1914
02:30:02,838 --> 02:30:06,467
No, Raja. No. What are you doing?

1915
02:30:06,798 --> 02:30:08,629
Raja, no.

1916
02:30:09,078 --> 02:30:11,148
No. Raja.

1917
02:30:11,598 --> 02:30:13,589
No. No.

1918
02:30:13,678 --> 02:30:15,191
Raja.

1919
02:30:17,158 --> 02:30:18,477
No.

1920
02:30:26,158 --> 02:30:28,069
Raja.

1921
02:30:31,758 --> 02:30:33,350
What are you looking at?

1922
02:30:34,478 --> 02:30:37,993
The girl is there. The fire is lit.

1923
02:30:38,558 --> 02:30:41,026
And today is 25th of October.

1924
02:30:42,358 --> 02:30:45,236
Take the nuptial rounds of the sacred fire.

1925
02:31:01,598 --> 02:31:04,715
The elder brother has the right to tie the knot.

1926
02:31:07,638 --> 02:31:12,268
No, Brother. No. No.

1927
02:31:55,438 --> 02:31:57,156
Help.

1928
02:31:57,558 --> 02:32:00,072
Help.

1929
02:32:00,158 --> 02:32:03,389
This is your punishment. Nobody will save you.

1930
02:32:03,478 --> 02:32:06,436
No, Mr. Rana. Our aim is not to kill him.

1931
02:32:06,638 --> 02:32:08,515
His atonement is our victory.

1932
02:32:26,918 --> 02:32:28,237
Look at this.

1933
02:32:28,558 --> 02:32:31,834
In spite of being so unjust to him, he forgave you.

1934
02:32:32,558 --> 02:32:33,911
Come on. Apologise to him.

1935
02:32:36,718 --> 02:32:38,674
Forgive me, Birju.

1936
02:32:38,878 --> 02:32:41,711
Brijnath, I'm your offender as well.

1937
02:32:42,918 --> 02:32:44,715
Forgive me too.

1938
02:32:45,038 --> 02:32:49,236
Today I know that marriages are made in heaven.

1939
02:32:50,238 --> 02:32:52,832
No power in the world can break them.

1940
02:32:54,078 --> 02:32:55,431
No power can break them.

1941
02:33:09,758 --> 02:33:11,749
I won't let you go.

1942
02:33:11,838 --> 02:33:15,035
I won't let you go on your honeymoon.

1943
02:33:17,198 --> 02:33:20,270
This is the second time that I've escaped from the mental asylum.

1944
02:33:20,358 --> 02:33:23,031
Now tell me. What was that thing? Tell me.

1945
02:33:23,118 --> 02:33:24,471
Come here.

1946
02:33:25,238 --> 02:33:26,353
Tell me quickly.

1947
02:33:26,438 --> 02:33:30,477
Look, I request you. I beg of you.

1948
02:33:30,558 --> 02:33:33,391
Please tell me. What was that thing?

1949
02:33:33,478 --> 02:33:36,709
Fine, actually. . .

1950
02:33:36,918 --> 02:33:38,397
Let it be. You'll get angry.

1951
02:33:38,478 --> 02:33:41,072
I don't get angry. I told you.

1952
02:33:41,158 --> 02:33:42,750
Fine. I'll tell you.

1953
02:33:42,878 --> 02:33:43,947
I will ask my husband, and tell you.

1954
02:33:44,038 --> 02:33:46,233
Ask anybody you want to. But tell me.

1955
02:33:46,318 --> 02:33:49,116
Raja, he is mad. Push off as soon as you get the chance.

1956
02:33:50,718 --> 02:33:52,231
Actually. . .

1957
02:33:53,078 --> 02:33:56,434
No. Tell me.

1958
02:33:56,758 --> 02:33:58,316
Oh, madam. . .

1959
02:34:02,918 --> 02:34:07,116
Cheater woman, you fooled me again.

1960
02:34:08,598 --> 02:34:10,316
Where are you all going?

1961
02:34:10,398 --> 02:34:13,470
At least you tell me. What was that thing?

1962
02:34:13,678 --> 02:34:16,670
I won't get angry. I won't get angry.
