1
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,040
What do you still doubt, Daegam?

2
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,290
Were you not approve this transaction?

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,260
Joseon era now, had only one person has been able to embed frills independence movement.

4
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,680
By reason of saving the nation cheats here and there.

5
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,230
How can I believe in you and provide military funding?

6
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,570
Do not equate us with the bastards.

7
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,860
In addition to getting what you want,

8
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,120
You can also contribute to efforts to liberate the homeland.

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,080
This is the counterfeit goods.

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,870
How dare you try to screw me?

11
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,580
Daegam ...

12
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,210
Yeonggam-nim, matamu sudah rabun ya?

13
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,920
Have been agreed on beforehand. Why even stalling?

14
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,770
Then why do not you meet the time we agreed together?

60
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,820
Kim Jang Ok, listen carefully!

61
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,490
You are surrounded. There is no chance for you to escape.

62
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,620
Put your weapons and surrender immediately!

63
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,910
How?

64
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,040
Really stubborn. Still insist survive.

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,710
It certainly was.

66
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,920
However, they are members of the core team Taksim.

67
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,850
I'll try to persuade him to surrender.

68
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,690
Here!

69
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,530
Kim Jang Ok!

70
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,360
Can you hear me talking?

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,070
I'm Lee Jeong Chul.

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,790
Do not shoot!

73
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,250
Do not shoot!

74
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,010
I try to check the area around here for a while.

75
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,880
In the meantime do not act rashly.

76
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,720
You're giving me orders?

77
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,430
Why could have thought if this is the command?

78
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,730
Kim Jang Ok apprehended alive is the order of Higashi Bucho.

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,640
Ringkus him!

80
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,330
Attack!

81
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,630
Right here!

82
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,560
Do not shoot!

83
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,220
I told you do not shoot!

84
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,070
Healthy!

85
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,240
Possible!

86
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,000
Backward everything!

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,130
Possible!

88
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,840
Possible!

89
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,090
Lee Jeong Chul!

90
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,690
Jang Ok!

91
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,030
I was Lee Jeong Chul.

92
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,320
Let's talk for a minute.

93
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,240
The door will be opened. Do not shoot!

94
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,490
They were on top of betraying the country and you betray your people.

95
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,320
Nighttime sleep so you can still asleep.

96
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,330
Hordes of traitors!

97
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,790
You think inibisa independent state?

98
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,710
This ship was already shaky.

99
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,880
Yes.

100
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,800
Ships already shaky. Fleeing first is a coward.

101
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,640
Out.

102
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,310
If you're out, you can still maintain your life.

103
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,310
At least you have to defend your life.

104
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,230
I would never conspire with traitors.

105
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,320
Put your weapon!

106
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,990
Daehan independent life.

107
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,450

This is the genuine article.

112
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,140
Looks like they need immediate funds can be disbursed.

113
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,480
Supposedly Kim Jang Ok arrested alive.

114
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,520
Unfortunately battle this time.

115
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,150
You guys are friends, right?

116
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,240
Not.

117
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,080
Yeah well.

118
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,910
In hard times like this it's hard to find friends.

119
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,090
People who reached out first, that's your friend.

120
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,510
Sotoku-fu have great expectations on you.

123
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,200
Release him!

Joo Dong Seong mana?

126
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,860
They failed to capture Ok Jang Hyeong, only managed to catch Dong Joo Seong.

127
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,700
But a man named Lee Jeong Seong Dong Joo Chul freed recently captured a day ago.

128
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,870
Lee Jeong Chul?

129
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,000
The new man in the police. Joseon people.

130
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,960
Had served in the interim government in Shanghai.

131
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,290
And selling information to the Japanese government.

132
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,840
Because of his services that he managed to become a cop.

133
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,010
The evil and greedy.

134
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,720
Had served as a translator and far-flung connections.

135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
And the purpose of these actions is to sell government.

136
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,060
In other words, Lee Jeong Seong Dong Joo Chul freed with the goal of making it as bait?

137
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,720
One moment! Lest this place has been discovered?

138
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,020
Impossible. When we brought him here twiddling twirling first.

139
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,900
No one is stalking.

140
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,770
How do I deal with Dong Joo Seong?

141
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,530
No matter what kind of beaten up remains willing to open his mouth. We also can not do anything.

142
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,740
Remove him from the organization from something unexpected happened.

143
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,830
Let's make it like this...

144
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,960
You've escaped from hell alive.

145
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,260
I really do not know what happened.

146
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,840
He told me to go, so I went.

147
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,970
Kan Lee Jeong Chul who sent this freedom?

148
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,550
No, Hyeongnim.

149
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,970
The existence Ok Jang Hyeong also leaked from where we are.

150
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,810
It's not me, Hyeongnim.

151
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,850
It's not me.

152
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,150
Bastard like you who suck the blood of your own countrymen!

153
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,320
Why? Why suspect me?

154
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,740
Who Lee Jeong Chul 'no I do not know.

155
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,780
Hyeongnim, I really do not know who it was Lee Jeong Chul.

156
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,860
Really do not know.

157
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,950
Plans night was just the three of us know.

158
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,670
How did the police know?

159
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,330
I'm going to count to three. You'd better confess.

160
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,050
If not, heads will bloom shell.

161
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,380
One!

162
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,720
Who leaked the secret?

163
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,260
I am innocent.

164
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,550
I brought a bomb with his life,

165
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,600
why are you even suspect?

166
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,720
Two!

167
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,640
Damn!

168
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,180
Why only me a suspect?

169
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,350
So you-you are here there is no possibility of a spy?

170
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,900
Hyeongnim!

171
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,440
Three!

172
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,830
Joo Dong Seong.

173
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,340
You do not know why the enemies of freedom?

174
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,630
If you have not tired of life, never appeared rod nose in front of me!

175
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,350
Immediately leave Gyeongseong!
[Gyeongseong / Keijo - Seoul called the Japanese colonial era]

176
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,110
Hyeongnim...

177
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,700
You also do not believe me?

178
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,870
It looks like the independence army is facing difficulties funding problems.

179
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,380
They started selling valuables.

180
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,670
You know who he is?

181
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,130
Yes I know.

182
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,550
SD friend Jo Hoi Ryeong.

183
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,470
The son of an artist.

184
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,970
His name is Kim Woo Jin.

185
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,930
Reportedly worked with Hyeong running a photo studio business and antiques.

186
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,730
Reportedly all funds will be collected there and then transferred to the top.

187
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:07,070
Why the sudden need of funds in the independence army major jumlahyang?

188
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,110
What are they planning?

189
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,120
Reportedly ...

190
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,910
... They're buying up explosives from all directions.

191
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,580
Based on info from Shanghai,

192
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,710
they are communicating with the bomb.

193
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,300
There is new information?

194
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,470
Yeah, it looks like I locate. The new plan-and Giretsu fundraising.
[Giretsu - Militant group name Uilyeol-and in B. Japan]

195
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,760
Chaired by Jo Hoi Ryeong along with Kim Woo Jin.

196
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,770
It looks like they are Giretsu militants who infiltrated into the capital after Kim Jang Ok.

197
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:46,110
Very good. Why do not you find out if there could be lobbied.

198
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,950
If they ask whether it permits the transport or funds, give the green light!

199
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,410
Because they sibukkan undoubtedly this is the case.

200
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,370
Ready to execute.

201
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,370
In the future you cooperate with Hashimoto.

202
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,250
Please guide me.

203
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,920
I will try as much as possible.

204
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,830
Both?

205
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,920
I...

206
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
Working closely with the Inspector Lee, we would not be defeated.

207
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,340
Please guide me.

208
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,010
Hashimoto was hunting Giretsu chairman and Jeong Chae-San.

209
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,270
Share information only.

210
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,480
Utilizing this opportunity both of you set up your feeds that could provoke Jeong Chae San exit.

211
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,400
It's time to show kebolehanmu already arrived.

212
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,160
In this sense Inspector Lee has worked very well.

213
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,200
Hashimoto, you need a lot to learn from him.

214
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,370
Good.

215
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,840
You've heard about Gye Yeon Soon coming from China?

216
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,050
Secretary Jeong Chae San is a female member.

217
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,760
There is information that says if he had some time ago arrived in Gyeongseong.

218
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,890
But unfortunately none of the people who know her face looks like.

219
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,140
By capturing these women, together with Chae Jeong managed to strangle San.

220
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,640
- = Studio photo Yeongsaeng / antique shop. = - (A secret meeting place Uilyeol militant groups-and in Gyeongseong)

221
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,200
What preparations?

222
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,460
You stay here, I'll get there alone.

223
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,580
Own?

224
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,130
This time you do not have to participate.

225
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,380
Wait until the goods I move here.

226
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,760
This latter state is less secure.

227
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,260
Dangerous.

228
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,470
You're worried about me?

229
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,310
Not worried, but worried comrades.

230
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,350
Companion in arms ...

231
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,030
What if you help photographing seperjuanganmu friend?

232
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,940
Why suddenly talking like this?

233
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,360
You do not ever take my picture.

234
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,870
I want a piece.

235
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,150
One two...

236
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,840
There affairs what?

237
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,850
Kim Woo Jin-ssi which one?

238
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,720
I'm Kim Woo Jin.

239
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,690
I have a valuables. Could you please briefly checked?

240
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,450
Well, go to the top floor.

241
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,340
You know the origin of these items?

242
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,760
Aslikah ini?

243
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,680
Let me see.

244
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,910
Looks like the old man in Jongno get a windfall.

245
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,670
The basis of the fraudsters.

246
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,630
What do you mean?

247
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,050
That this is fake goods.

248
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,340
Except that an expert like me, would be hard to distinguish.

249
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,350
Oh ya?

250
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,440
These things I get from the hands of people I can trust.

251
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,440
Just a moment please.

252
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,180
Where do you think the original?

253
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,100
It looks no different.

254
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,650
That the age of 200 years. The other is freshly made spring of this year.

255
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,320
I have a ceramic factory in Shanghai.

256
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,860
A potty kusulap wreckage could become a historic relic of the royal family 300 years old.

257
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,450
What? This Is not no different than the scams?

258
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,160
If there is genuine, there is definitely fake one.

259
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,120
Honestly, the demand is far greater than the supply of goods.

260
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,790
Your ability to reap tremendous profits.

261
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,920
Could not if only a little, should be plenty.

262
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,080
It makes people envious.

263
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,970
You're engaged in what area? Why should envy me that an entrepreneur?

264
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,220
Inspector Lee Jeong Chul Police Agency.

265
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,260
Aigoo, I was being presumptuous.

266
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,350
Allow me to introduce myself.

267
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,470
My name is Kim Woo Jin.

268
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,270
Fail to recognize the important figure.

269
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,110
But why do you have a position in the police Chongdok-bu why be jealous of a small businessman like me?

270
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,070
Paid work, not fun.

271
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,160
Far greater than with a small businessman like myself.

272
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,620
Lee Gyeongbu...

273
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,710
You have connections with Japanese police in Shanghai?

274
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,510
Arguably so. I worked in Shanghai for some time.

275
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,220
Oh ya?

276
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,600
If so, can I ask a favor?

277
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,810
I would like to import some goods from Shanghai.

278
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,900
I is not a fund-raiser for the Liberation Army, just an ordinary businessman.

279
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,990
But I suspect that simply can not import anything.

280
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,410
Trivial things like this

281
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,240
you want bayarin I drink?

282
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:02,330
Lee Gyeongbu, you are interested to find additional revenue?

283
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,380
The feeling is really fun.

284
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,090
How?

285
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,260
While having a drink we'll talk about the business together, how?

286
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,550
Now?

287
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,220
When again?

288
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,270
Come on!

289
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,360
It turns out there is an event like this.

290
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,110
Ok Jang Hyeong was a village with me.

291
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,660
Ok Jang Hyeong you and are good friends since they worked in the interim government.

292
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,330
Then you and I have little connection.

293
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,580
But at the time you become a translator for the interim government.

294
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,250
Why now could be the Japanese police?

295
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,840
His heart is unpredictable.

296
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,720
Perhaps he was being tortured themselves to death.

297
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,930
Bujang-nim are now specifically asked me to here. Keep ya I changed to be like this.

298
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,690
And Jang Ok I used contacts in Shanghai.

299
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,690
Arguably is a congenial friend.

300
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,070
After Jang Ok death, I raised my toes.

301
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,410
And feels very light.

302
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,950
It was in my mind there is only mind as well.

303
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,000
I knew this would definitely like.

304
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,840
You are not sadists. I knew from the beginning.

305
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,090
If it does not become a police officer, would have to be a poet.

306
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,010
Drink there!

307
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,640
Yes, I would drink.

308
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,930
Starting today, I'll call you "hyeong."

309
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,730
Whatever.

310
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,230
Not important.

311
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,030
Beware the stairs!

312
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,160
Today drank a lot.

313
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,620
Hyeongnim, thank you. Go home.

314
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,450
Be careful on the road.

315
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,450
Yes.

316
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,410
Be careful on the road.

317
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,090
Be careful on the road, Hyeongnim.

318
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,760
Operator.

319
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,430
I was Lee Jeong Chul of Police Chongdok-bu.

320
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,050
Please connect me to the Police Agency.

321
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,900
Kim Sa Hee, do not have to go to the office tomorrow.

322
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,150
Sampandong to get the stuff you never talk about it.

323
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,610
This is important stuff. Should be extra careful.

324
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:43,610

Sampandong, at 7.

327
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,930
In other words if Uilyeol-and managed to infiltrate into the capital city,

328
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,520
they will act through this pathway.

Kim Woo Jin bastard. I knew it would be like this.

332
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,570
This bitch is a whale.

333
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,200
The other is the path to be taken by the Union Rickshaw.

334
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,160
The problem is whether the path they take is in line with Kim Jang Ok.

335
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,960
This is why in the open?

336
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,880
You show it to others?

337
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,630
Kim Sa Hee!

338
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,110
Once out of the door, it turned out I had been awaited by Hashimoto Gyeongbu.

339
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,190
He said should exchange information. Therefore...

340
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,820
Bring the car to the front door!

341
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,160

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,740
Fast! Hashimoto had acted before.

344
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,620

There was stuff inside. Could you please help lift into the rickshaw?

350
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,650
Good.

351
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,460
Lift alone, right?

352
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,360
- = Already exposed. Beware of Hashimoto. = -

353
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,070
I told you to be caught alive.

354
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,550
Sunyeo-nim, the Japanese police were in front of the gate.

355
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,450
Be careful!

Women who are hiding in the convent was not willing to arrest you?

358
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,840
Kuwanti already cautioned, the problem with this mission can not be told to anyone, even to your mother or your great.

359
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,460
You look is still worth you call yourself Japanese police?

360
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,470
Sorry.

361
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,680
Who is this person?

362
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,150
A - I was the informant of

Why are not you screaming in the street alone

367
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,310
if you're a cop captured the independence movement?

368
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,690
Useless!

369
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,490
Already satisfied making a scene yet?

370
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,910
What do you mean?

371
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,870
If there are only two of us, talk to the Korean language.

372

Laboriously track them down and spread the bait ...

373
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,460
why should they panic and flee?

374
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,800
Is there a specific procedure in the army arrested the independence movement?

375
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,510
If you know so, should they be arrested before he could escape.

376
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,350
Not appropriate for you to ask me.

377
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,980
Supposedly you can keep track of how these police information to leak out.

378

Do you intend to defy me?

379
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,330
According to reliable information Jeong Chae San have been to Shanghai.

380
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,710
It seems to collect the explosives expert of Shanghai.

381
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,260
And it looks like all members Uilyeol-and had fled to Shanghai.

Antique shop owner Kim Woo Jin from since the morning have also been invisible bridge of his nose again.

383

All of this is caused by the aspect operasional--

Do not waste any more time! Immediately went to Shanghai!

You stay here. Collect all the news submitted by Hashimoto from Shanghai.

What if kulaporkan directly without passing Kim Sa Hee?

There are things I want to talk to you. A few more days I'm going to Shanghai.

404
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,690
I hope you can come and get me.

405

Lee Jeong Chul.

406
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,380
This place is not safe anymore.

407
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,590
I hope for a while, you hide away some time in Manchuria.

408
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,260
Now we're fighting an enemy that is invisible.

409
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,970
The situation really dangerous.

410
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,550
I also agree with the proposal Gye Soon.

411
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,410
What do you think about Lee Jeong Chul this person?

412
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,580
Can be trusted?

413
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,500
We both are Umpang thrown by anglers.

414
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,210
Including friends like?

415
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,880
I've heard Kim Jang Ok offend this person's name.

416
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,140
He said he was a close friend.

417
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,890
Just past.

418
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,190
Now we do not have the time or people.

419
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,740
Bite this feed.

420
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,540
Investigate sow discord.

421
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,620
For enemy spies to spy for us.

422
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,130
The most dangerous among the spy,

423
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,170
but also the most effective tactics to sow discord.

424
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,380
I do not agree.

425
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,800
Target enemy is you, nor-nim.

426
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,430
There is a risk?

427
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,100
Definitive nature of people like this, like the grass on the fence that was blowing in the direction of the wind.

428
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,190
We'll see this time he sounded direction.

429
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,280
Spies for both sides but only one true homeland.

430
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,120
And it certainly occupies a special place in his heart.

431
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,660
Let's help him open the door.

432
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,790
Inner struggle is the most frightening thing.

433
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,810
If we go down together, Kim Woo Jin would suspect.

434
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,770
You go out of there.

435
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,290
He has come. Smile a little!

436
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,680
No need to smile.

437
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,300
Aigoo, Hyeongnim! Long time no see.

438
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,930
Certainly busy, huh? I thought not even see you here.

439
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,850
As you ordered, had to find out.

440
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,890
Among the Hungarian anarchist very lack of professionals in this field.

441
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,980
It could be that they have received assistance from these people.

442
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,230
There are some external people who intend to fight for the independence of Joseon.

443
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,270
Why?

444
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,440
By helping a country to form a government, they will be successful and prosperous.

445
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,240
- If there is time to stop by the office. - Janggwan fuck is that?

446
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,490
In the eyes of Janggwan was just no money. Besides money, there was nothing he cared.

447
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,250
When are you going mempertemukanku with eye-matammu?

448
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,910
Since the incidence of leaking information on Gyeongseong,

449
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,710
Uilyeol members-and to be very careful and not act rashly.

450
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,800
Be careful that's their business, is not it?

451
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,420
And finding these people is our duty.

452
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,130
I believe in Uilyeol members-and there our spies.

453
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,850
Every gestures Lee Jeong Chul still under close supervision, is not it?

454
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,900
Shanghai experienced a tremendous change within the next few years.

455
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:45,460
I tuh want to stop working in the police and start a business here. Do you have any suggestions, Dongsaeng?

456
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,090
Finally Hyeong mind open as well.

457
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,380
Nice thought.

458
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,010
Job "selling" the country for a while are more relaxed.

459
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,340
But the guilt that plagued'll torture lifetime.

460
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,300
Once melodious singing.

461
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,640
In short, I've only been active in the interim government here.

462
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,900
It's been quite a long time I left Shanghai. Never was also in touch with the people in the interim government.

463
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,730
In addition to the Japanese people, I do not know the experts who are here.

464
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,030
I'm looking for someone.

465
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,200
Do not give out first! Let me guess.

466
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,910
You need the Joseon experts who have relations with the interim government.

467
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,830
New half the story you already know. You're the ghost huh?

468
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,250
Penyampaianku intelligent way kah?

469
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,960
The business name is half the capital half cleverness.

470
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,750
I already understand. Although I do not know who you're looking for.

471
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,170
But I will help you find an expert who is very close relationship with the interim government.

472
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,430
You've said you wanted to look around the ceramic factory, right?

473
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,640
Immediately there. The place is also not far from the residence.

474
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,310
Yes, let's.

475
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,900
You both need anything?

476
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,070
More recently there are foreigners who come to buy explosives in large quantities?

477
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,950
We do not sell explosives.

478
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,660
Do not lie! I'm here because it already knows.

479
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,540
Nothing like this. There! There!

480
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:14,170
Hei! Hei! Bos! Bos! Hei! Hei!

481
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,770
He said lately there was a fighter of the Hungarian revolution often here.

482
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,320
Hungary believed the poor were explosives experts.

483
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,070
He worked at the French pharmaceuticals.

484
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,990
But his wife is Asian.

485
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,210
You forgot this.

486
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,960
It's your husband.

487
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,720
thanks.

488
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,440
When I have time to stop by our house for dinner.

489
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,560
thanks.

490
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,730
Bye.

491
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,620
Do not get into! Follow me!

492
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,320
Tomorrow eat French cuisine only.

493
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,820
Drink a glass before returning goods.

494
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,070
Today is a rest first. Still tired from the trip. Do not forget to request earlier.

495
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,030
What?

496
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,750
Forgot to mention, right? Goods enter Gyeongseong my art.

497
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,830
Sure, sure.

498
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,000
Be careful.

499
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,420
Sign in and rest.

500
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,640
Damn, eating only costly.

501
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,000
Who?

502
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,390
What's up in the morning?

503
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,060
Let's go eat breakfast!

504
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,730
This early?

505
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,740
Bird early risers will find many caterpillars.

506
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,860
Birds that get up early to be caught first.

507
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,470
Doenjang fragrant.

508
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:37,990
Hyeong, you must help me.

509
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,660
I told you I'll help.

510
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,410
Right now my head shell which will be at stake.

511
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,960
I am very scared.

512
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,090
Yes, should you be afraid. Because your heads will be at stake as well.

513
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,460
New invited to eat you had asked for my head is at stake?

514
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,030
How? In accordance with the tastes?

515
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,120
Fortunately. I was chairman Uilyeol-and, Jeong Chae San.

516
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,540
At the moment in a revolutionary organization Goryeo I've heard we Dongji offensive about you.

517
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,750
There are also many Dongji very grateful for the help of Lee Gyeongbu that time.

518
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,220
I want to see you, so I asked for help Woo Jin to introduce you to me.

519
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,510
I'm flattered.

520
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:49,480
You are welcome. If it was not thanks to Lee Gyeongbu, where there is a chance I

521
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,520
sit down and eat with a Gyeongbu of the police station.

522
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,150
But how can you trust me with the status of a police officer?

523
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,450
Why glaring at me? I did not say anything.

524
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:05,160
Danjang-nim hear his own time in Shanghai.

525
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,660
Eating together with the people of the village in a place thousands of miles away, why his speech was so long-winded?

526
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,830
Come on, let's eat.

527
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,920
Without alcohol, which arguably entertaining guests.

528
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,400
You seem to have made up his mind would make me rich.

529
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,320
Bring the highest rewards, Jeong Chae San front of me.

530
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,360
What do you want to do now? Old you are still green makes you not tremble to anything, so?

531
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,200
I had long forgotten what fear is.

532
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,740
Why? Fear?

533
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,790
Your goal is for these approaches me, right?

534
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,700
The person had been in front of your eyes, what are you waiting?

535
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,160
I could spend Jeong Chae San now.

536
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,210
Please try.

537
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,340
If I go now, you'll all fall in danger.

538
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:02,050
Lee Jeong Chul Gyeongbu of Chongdokbu staying up drinking together with Chae Jeong-and Uilyeol San chairman.

539
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,930
It certainly is widespread throughout Shanghai.

540
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,760
You're threatening me?

541
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,600
You do not know what situation you own now?

542
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,060
You really do not know?

543
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,440
After arriving here, Higashi been looking for you?

544
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,700
Why do you think the Japanese people who came with you about the Shanghai government hides from you?

545
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,820
Due to complete its mission alone.

546
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:30,160
I have often met with someone like that is to the left and to the right but eventually collapsed.

547
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,010
Actually this is not as much as expected.

548
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,270
While talking about home, drink as much.

549
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,730
Although I was a hyeong, but I'm not so strong drink.

550
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,280
When did you become hyeong?

551
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:09,410
Come on!

552
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,790
Come on, you are also drinking.

553
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,580
Come on, let's toast.

554
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,260
Cheers!

555
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,140
Here the glass.

556
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,710
Come on!

557
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,190
Come on!

558
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,310
Come on!

559
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,300
Come on!

560
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:10,760
So fast?

561
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,290
Lee Gyeongbu.

562
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,590
You like fishing at night?

563
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:58,430
When depression fishing to make here is actually quite relaxed.

564
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:05,520
Sitting in the dark riverbank instead will make you forget the fear.

565
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,530
Do you feel afraid?

566
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,740
Of course.

567
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,280
I was the military who lost the state.

568
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:19,790
Wandering to and fro with the status of soldiers who fled.

569
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:25,590
I had the most confidence in the sense of alertness.

570
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:32,880
Who will stand on my side, and who is going to help sustain life,

571
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,760
the ability to determine.

572
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,100
I believe Lee Gyeongbu will help me.

573
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:45,230
I am a salaried police.

574
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,770
People who only know hunting gains already plastered on the front of the eye.

575
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,280
I can not guarantee my mind will change.

576
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:23,020
Lee Gyeongbu, push me into the water right now!

577
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,480
If really you want that, do it now.

578
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,570
Such an opportunity will not come again.

579
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,120
Why can not believe in yourself?

580
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,910
I can not believe what people say. I said anything I did not already own faith.

581
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:48,290
I only believe what I should do. What should be done by someone.

582
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:58,390
Because sometimes people will be in the moment in which he does not know. The moment in which the status of self must be disregarded.

583
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,850
Lee Dongji, I wish that my name recorded in the history books like this.

584
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:27,080
Later, I'll leave you my time Lee Gyeongbu.

585
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,760
Help us, we had to.

586
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,180
I think I want to crazy.

587
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,020
Indeed many bacotmu. What should I do?

588
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,890
We ... came to Gyeongseong safely. Just that.

589
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,730
But too many stumbling blocks.

590
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:53,070
The rest we complete yourself. We will not trouble you.

591
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:03,240
The decision is yours. I will not blame you.

592
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:08,830
I'm no different from the deceased Ok Jang Hyeong. Even ghosts have to be lonely,

593
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,000
also do not want to be a ghost coward.

594
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,220
I do not know the next time when we meet again I've turned into such things.

595
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,680
Did you know?

596
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,430
These are all false. I pretended not to know anything.

597
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,390
He opened a factory and so trust me.

598
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,060
Hashimoto!

599
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,230
These are all false.

600
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,690
I pretended I did not know anything.

601
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,440
He opened a factory and so trust me.

602
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:23,660
Kim Woo Jin wants to Tokyo. He filed a second sheet travel documents. Do you think he'll go with who?

603
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,410
It is certain to San Chae Jeong, Jeong Chae San.

604
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:30,750
Kim Woo Jin is the number two. Tomorrow they are going to the port. Hurry to apply for a warrant!

605
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,460
Your information is accurate?

606
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,050
Then the prize money I eat it yourself.

607
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,970
If you do not believe me, please find their own information out there.

608
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,610
You are Kang Jong Gye?

609
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,990
Here other than I was there someone else?

610
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,410
Jeong Chae San No?

611
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,540
Our target is to bring the explosives safely to the Gyeongseong.

612
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,930
Each disguise identities and hide explosives.

613
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,430
The most notorious in the box where?

614
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:29,320
Where are these people?

615
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,740
Even if there is something undesirable upon us,

616
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,830
This box should arrive safely at Gyeongseong.

617
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,960
Search carefully!

618
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:55,390
I will send more people to the port to Shanghai tomorrow.

619
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,600
The time had arrived.

620
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,030
Everyone departs from the station Gyeongseong.

621
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,200
After meeting at the last meeting which has been approved, the mission would end.

622
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:26,010
I and Heo Cheol Joo will bring a box containing explosives to Andong Station by train.

623
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:30,300
After the box arrived in Andong, stayed transported to the cargo section.

624
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:37,980
Well, we all have to meet at the station Andong in a state without lacking anything.

625
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,770
Done.

626
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:52,160
What is this? What happens is this?

627
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,660
Kim Woo Jin mana?

628
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,250
The entire pier had been searched, nothing.

629
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,210
What?

630
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:05,750
The entire pier had been searched but no.

631
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,300
How did you work?

632
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,050
What informer?

633
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,720
Content is the details were unclear because he is subordinate.

634
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,060
During this time you were using the informant useless like this?

635
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:21,060
Although no one in the upper layer, but due to worry about getting caught anniversary meeting reduced.

636
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,110
Should you tell me. Our actions as a whole should be planned carefully in advance.

637
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:28,280
You think this is my decision?

638
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,030
I'm just carrying out orders from superiors.

639
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:35,200
Bosses also ordered to excommunicate the mission this time?

640
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,330
This is an order from Higashi?

641
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:40,790
Lee Gyeongbu information can not be trusted. It is a fact, is not it?

642
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,500
You think I'm that fabricate information?

643
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:47,710
Your information is junk information! Rightly informer replaced, is not it?

644
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,520
The cost for the entertainment you used to?

645
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,960
What?

646
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:05,110
Not a ship, but the train.

647
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:06,634
Train?

648
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,440
Where are you going?

649
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:13,610
It seems like they go on their own and make a pact to meet each other in Andong then equally toward Gyeongseong.

650
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:16,740
Oh, yes? Sure?

651
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,500
Chae Jeong San risked their lives to go to Gyeongseong.

652
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,250
Are you sure?

653
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,790
Jeong Chae San participating in the trip or not I'm not so clear.

654
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,880
What? Now the most important thing is Jeong Chae San.

655
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,260
You even say it is not clear Jeong Chae San participate or not in the course of it?

656
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,720
Anu, if according to my informant

657
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,510
And Yeon Woo Jin Kim Gye Soon a team. They hid in a few places then meet in Andong.

658
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:41,810
Down from the car and you repeat your report, bitch! ß Basic rude!

659
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,520
What is the importance of his men to Gyeongseong or not?

660
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,360
Jeong Chae San ke mana? Jeong Chae San!

661
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,070
No information about it.

662
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,570
Who gave you this kind of information?

663
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:54,700
One of their members who participate in the quest to Gyeongseong this time.

664
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,080
Makes sense does not it? If indeed he was a core member should he know Jeong Chae San whither.

665
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,450
Reportedly in the organization Uilyeol-and no single member knows exactly where Jeong Chae San.

666
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:06,290
Actions to be taken are always kept confidential. At the time of the execution of new notified.

667
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,750
So I asked who it was, shucks!

668
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,420
Stop it. For now still can not be told.

669
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,550
You go find out where Jeong Chae San!

670
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,300
Good, let's get moving!

671
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,600
What if this information is false?

672
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,350
At that time Uilyeol-and, Jeong Chae San

673
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,680
did not work we ringkus, want to go back empty-handed and looking silly?

674
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,270
No, this time the information is reliable.

675
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:26,440
Informants this time one hundred percent trustworthy.

676
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,190
Rewards promised him this time is very seductive.

677
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:31,320
Kim Jang Ok hideaway also leaked by this.

678
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,700
Otherwise, we will not have the opportunity to approach Jeong Chae San, is not it?

679
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:40,030
Let's take action.

680
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:38,280
= The train with the aim Gyeongseong will depart within 5 minutes. =

681
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:13,020
= Train with destination Gyeongseong will soon leave. Passengers are expected to soon rise into the train. =

682
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,110
Let us scatter and search! You want which direction?

683
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:30,540
Gye Yeon Soon along the West should be in first-class carriage. Gye Yeon Soon I'll find.

684
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:33,920
Do you want to get the services of a self-selected for capture Gye Soon Yeon, would not you say?

685
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,250
What?

686
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:39,090
Then you're over there, I'm here.

687
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,760
But are you sure they are in this train?

688

733
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:15,060
I'm out looking for some fresh air.

734
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,490
What happened? Why be here?

735
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:33,950
You've been caught. Gye Yeon Soon there where?

736
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:36,290
He was with the Caucasians?

737
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:38,710
True, they were in the first-class carriage.

738
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:40,670
Hashimoto was headed there.

739
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:42,880
What? The train journey is only our members know. Why can...

740
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,710
Anggotamu who were on the train is one of them is an informant.

741
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:49,590
Bastard was also leaked the existence of Kim Jang Ok.

742
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:52,470
Because you are now my position so little dangerous.

743
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:57,640
In short, Hashimoto should be prevented so he does not wander searched.

744
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:01,480
It let me think of something. You also have to find the best solution.

745
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:30,090
Anggotamu who were on the train is one of them is an informant.

746
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,350
Please keep stuff for a while.

747
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,880
Next door there is no?

748
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,250
It looks like nothing.

749
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,170
OK.

750
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,220
Hashimoto!

751
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,270
One moment!

752
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,940
You sit down here.

753
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:41,570
I think searched in this way would arouse suspicion.

754
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,030
Even if you've met, also have to be patient until arriving at Gyeongseong.

755
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:48,040
If you can not get caught everything, we must also consider their counterattack.

756
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:53,000
Therefore if Kim Woo Jin was found, or someone suspicious, watched silently.

757
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,550
After arriving at the new Gyeongseong arrested all of them. What do you think?

758
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:02,180
Makes sense.

759
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:05,310
Okay, then. Do not get too excited in the act.

760
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:09,140
Be like the passengers in general. Keep an eye secretly.

761
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:13,980
So you mean, no matter what the passengers must be supervised?

762
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,400
Yeah, right.

763
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,280
No, I mean I will act with caution.

764
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,400
Apprehended them all at once instead of making them to be vigilant.

765
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,740
I see what you mean.

766
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:25,120
You follow me rummage with the distance apart of the carriage.

767
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,090
Sorry, I just want to ride through.

768
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,010
Why is my diaper ...

769
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:12,390
It smelled really stung. Excuse me.

770
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,390
Pretended not to know me. Straight ahead.

771
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,980
Fifteen minutes, in between carriages.

772
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,480
Damn!

773
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,860
Hoi Ryeong!

774
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,700
The meeting place after arriving in Gyeongseong should be replaced.

775
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,910
I sensed if the location had been discovered.

776
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:32,540
Really? Hour and place ...

777
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:38,630
Hotel Hwanggeumjeonmog-in, jam empat.

778
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:43,550
I will tell them one by one. Avoid contact with others to avoid problems.

779
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:45,420
If there is something unexpected,

780
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:50,800
show license trip and said you were Westerners. They would not dare do anything against you.

781
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:55,600
Once we arrived at the station Gyeongseong, leave the place with carrying explosives

782
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,310
and is located at Jongno street Tongtaehwa in five hours.

783
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:00,190
Good.

784
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:03,530
Just a precaution, the location of the meeting in Gyeongseong will be replaced.

785
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,490
The new meeting location is

786
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:09,990
Hotel Hwanggeumjeonmog-ins.

787
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:11,910
Six hours.

788
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:16,580
Hotel Hwanggeumjeonmog-in, jam enam.

789
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:23,300
The meeting location has been changed. Hotel Tongtaehwa in Jongno street at four.

790
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,880
Hotel Tongtaehwa in Jongno street four hours.

791
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,300
Shop coat in Deokseung-dong, five.

792
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:35,060
Including Simsang-do. Do not tell it to anyone.

793
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,060
Good.

794
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:03,000
What is wrong? Frequently meet me in danger.

795
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,300
Listen carefully to what I would say from now on.

796
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,550
Just now I was met by my members individually and tell them about the change of plans.

797
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:14,350
Separately giving the time and location of the meeting different.

798
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:15,430
Before the train arrives at its destination,

799
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:19,690
The informant will pass this information to the informant Hashimoto.

800
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:22,650
That person was an informant. And he is the bastard who betrayed Ok Jang Hyeong.

801
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,690
I told you, we encounter extremely dangerous.

802
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:28,490
Enough you tell it to me. They must know the location and time.

803
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:32,030
Why should I interfere in your mission? Try love reason.

804
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:35,280
If they find out we've been working together, you will be in danger.

805
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,500
Think carefully, actually people who pass on information to the Japanese it was you.

806
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,420
Therefore, we can safely get into this train.

807
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:45,210
Disguised as one of you and melobimu is my job.

808
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:48,420
I was the informant. It was approved by the Higashi.

809
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:51,970
But you have to do a scary act Higashi unknown to us.

810
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:54,850
Damn, so see you play directly threatened.

811
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,850
The present situation does not allow to find another solution. Then you think I should do?

812
01:20:57,850 --> 01:21:00,770
Detonate the bomb and die together?

813
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:02,520
Hyeong!

814
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:06,650
Keep us safe until the Gyeongseong.

815
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:12,820
I'll be waiting in the dining car. Hurry up there!

816
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,660
Damn!

817
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,130
How?

818
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:29,840
Either he was disguised as a parent or anything. Not met at all.

819
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,340
Then look again! How? You've found the informant Uilyeol-and-so?

820
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:37,010
Just now I met him.

821
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,640
It seems there is a new clue.

822
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:46,060
Here's our plan.

823
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:47,400
Informants we place in Uilyeol-and it

824
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:52,990
will deliver the core members such as Kim Woo Jin, Gye Yeon Soon and other members.

825
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:54,320
People Uilyeol-and no one knows if we are on this train.

826
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,120
Therefore they are going out into the train station this calmly.

827
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,330
Our men have surrounded tight all the way out of the train station.

828
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:03,250
Once they arrive at the train station, everything will be immediately arrested by our people.

829
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,790
So you're saying before arriving in Gyeongseong, they absolutely will not be tampered with?

830
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:08,380
Right, so just listen to your ideas

831
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,420
plus people Uilyeol-and it was by far more than us, there is a possibility the position we are in danger.

832
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:15,300
From now on we have to wait for the arrival of the Gyeongseong calmly.

833
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:18,140
Finally able to wipe Uilyeol-and.

834
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:21,890
The day on which Jeong Chae San'll be caught is imminent. So increasingly tense.

835
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:35,240
I want to have a beer first.

836
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:38,120
You want to come?

837
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,240
No, I do not like to drink. You go alone.

838
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:47,790
Yeah, too, had worked hard all day. Take a break. I went for a while.

839
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:46,430
What would you like to have?

840
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:47,980
Give me a bottle of beer.

841
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,100
Good.

842
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:50,230
I grab a towel for a while.

843
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:51,350
thanks.

844
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,990
Sorry.

845
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:12,380
Who are you?

846
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,800
Nothing.

847
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:20,180
It's okay, it's okay. Please be continued eating.

848
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:23,140
Nothing.

849
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,750
Do not look at you, I thought something happened to you.

850
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:57,840
Too stuffy in the cabin. So I went out for some fresh air. What news?

851
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,280
There is.

852
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:02,180
Where? What time?

853
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:10,270
Hotel Hwanggeumjeonmog-ins.

854
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:14,900
Hotel Hwanggeumjeonmog-ins.

855
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,150
Four hours.

856
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:20,780
Four hours.

857
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:29,660
Think carefully! Do not acting on the train. We could all die.

858
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,250
From now on, you take care of yourself.

859
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,710
Do not come looking for me again.

860
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:44,010
Hey, Kim Woo Jin ... Our relationship is pretty up here alone.

861
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,980
Did not he want to break you in your seat?

862
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,980
Now that I think

863
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:02,320
I should accompany Lee Gyeongbu drinks.

864
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,450
A glass of beer.

865
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,030
Good.

866
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,920
Theatrics really convincing.

867
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:14,020
No one wants you to tell me?

868
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:23,400
These people face very similar to the person we are looking for. What do you think?

869
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:31,870
What are you talking?

870
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:37,120
From now on I gave the orders here. Fucking bastard!

871
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:41,590
I gave the orders. You just need to do it without a lot of snout.

872
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:50,470
I was a cop, show your identity card.

873
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:59,190
Wait a minute! Do not move.

874
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,810
Hei!

875
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:17,500
The identity card was in his wallet. Want me alone ...

876
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:21,920
You two listen good. One-one, you're going to die here.

877
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,800
Depending on who is calling the other party.

878
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,220
You have to think about it.

879
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:39,770
Kim Woo Jin.

880
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,450
Now!

881
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,040
Son of a bitch!

882
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:03,180
Move! Move!

883
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:12,190
When kunasehati, you do not want to hear.

884
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:13,900
Move! Move!

885
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:20,870
I am a Japanese police from the police headquarters.

886
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:24,580
I'm on official duty. You all do not panic. Please return to your seat each.

887
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:26,000
Good.

888
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:33,340
Back to seat each!

889
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:46,140
You change your mind?

890
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,320
Not changed his mind. More precisely changed determination.

891
01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:00,240
I've actually been a long time did not have the determination again.

892
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:02,410
I've long since given up.

893
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:06,620
Where can you just give up?

894
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:09,920
If we ever succeed once, I certainly would not like this.

895
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,050
If only by risking their lives by throwing some bombs seeds will be able to get independence.

896
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:19,260
I can not continually play dumb.

897
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,600
Even after arriving in Gyeongseong, there will not be any changes.

898
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,140
It is an impossible thing.

899
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,310
Even if this time I managed menghindar--

900
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:30,190
Evade? Who's with whom? You with me? With us?

901
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:37,360
If not that, you, you ... have long kubeberkan everything.

902
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:42,530
Because you are my friend, you are my family.

903
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,750
Should not you thank me?

904
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,420
I want to avenge Ok Jang Hyeong.

905
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:06,020
I'm not your friend. I do not have any feeling about you.

906
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:15,570
You want to tell this fucking kill Caucasians?

907
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,950
On behalf of Uilyeol-and, I execute enemy spies.

908
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,620
Woo Jin!

909
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:31,170
See you in hell.

910
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:46,600
After arriving in Gyeongseong, I do not know you anymore.

911
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:51,310
Take this out of the train station.

912
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:59,860
By the time we meet again, if you did not die then I live.

913
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:02,070
Or two of them died.

914
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:33,370
- = Station Gyeongseong = -

915
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,230
Like?

916
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:24,190
No, I'm not that person.

917
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,570
Get him!

918
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,160
Yeon Gye Soon!

919
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,640
Run fast!

920
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:03,190
Move! Move!

921
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:04,060
Get him!

922
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,500
Move! Move!

923
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:33,110
Calm! Calm! Calm!

924
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:34,950
Let go of me!

925
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:36,450
Quiet!

926
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:39,720
Sorry.

927
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:42,560
How is your condition?

928
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,100
Could immediately behind the work.

929
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:54,690
After a shot and a jump from the train but you're only minor injuries.

930
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:57,070
Really lucky.

931
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:04,490
It is regrettable to lose Hashimoto.

932
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:12,040
But you also made a large contribution.

933
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:30,390
They say you can for the sake of great fishing, you throw a good bait.

934
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:39,490
You know who this is?

935
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,220
I know you're fluent in several languages. But it should be the most fluent Korean language, is not it?

936
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:06,350
Here was someone who could communicate with you in Korean.

937
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,730
Ask him where Kim Woo Jin.

938
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:18,690
Where Kim Woo Jin?

939
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:21,530
Wait a minute!

940
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,790
Which simply use it alone?

941
01:41:55,310 --> 01:42:01,150
Kim Woo Kim Woo Jin Jin ... where? If you open your mouth, everything will be fine.

942
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:07,580
I do not know. I really do not know anything.

943
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:23,970
Lee Gyeongbu.

944
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:33,010
Bucho.

945
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:35,440
Do it!

946
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:38,860
Do it!

947
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:51,740
Quick! Quick!

948
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,040
- Tell me! Quick to say! Fast! - Dont know.

949
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:58,540
- Fast! Quick to say! - Do not know! Do not! Do not!

950
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,380
Quick to say! Quick!

951
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:03,130
Please, quickly say, fast!

952
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:41,290
The skin looks pale face.

953
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,760
Not like that.

954
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:48,970
He said you two are very close to the time in Shanghai.

955
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:53,470
You're suspicious of me?

956
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:09,990
Everyone from the beginning has been suspect. But I do not.

957
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:17,200
Moreover, the work of an informant, due to the characteristics of his work, when carrying out tasks

958
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:21,710
Also questionable is not fair.

959
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,760
Terauchi Sotoku upon appointment once said so ...

960
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:36,350
"The Joseon choice is only following the orders of the Japanese or die."

961
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:40,640
Who told you were born so the Joseon?

962
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:45,320
Therefore, no matter what you've been doing,

963
01:44:47,070 --> 01:44:48,740
I never disputed.

964
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:53,990
Bring Kim Woo Jin here!

965
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:30,240
U-turn!

966
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:43,370
Passport!

967
01:45:45,830 --> 01:45:47,590
Seo Jin Dol!

968
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:53,010
Seo Jin Dol!

969
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:57,470
By the way, when the new weather can be warmer?

970
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:05,900
Take him away!

971
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:07,150
Try reconfirmed!

972
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:09,070
Get out!

973
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:10,150
Can not do it like that.

974
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:11,610
Give me the damn passport!

975
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:12,700
I have a right to be here.

976
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,570
Police!

977
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:19,080
Quick escape! Quick!

978
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:36,470
Mother, I will travel far. You have to stay alive and waiting for my return.

979
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:53,940
Mother, you have to stay alive and waiting for my return.

980
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:56,200
Mother!

981
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:39,200
Still not want to go home?

982
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,480
Hei, Joo Dong Seong!

983
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:13,210
Woo Hyeong Jin came to the house looking for me.

984
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:17,710
He told me to look for Lee Jeong Chul Gyeongbu to forge an identity card.

985
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:20,670
He said you would help him.

986
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,220
Kim Woo Jin.

987
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:11,180
How are you all?

988
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:18,520
Gye Soon must have suffered.

989
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:24,450
Look at you. You used to be so confident.

990
01:50:25,070 --> 01:50:27,030
Go, hurry!

991
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:28,910
This is a collier to Japan.

992
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:32,000
If you were to leave for Incheon, still trigger.

993
01:50:33,790 --> 01:50:36,210
How are Hyeong-by?

994
01:50:36,210 --> 01:50:38,710
Never seen it.

995
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:41,550
Then why here?

996
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:45,550
- Joo Dong Seong.
- Joo Dong Seong?

997
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:49,300
Did not you ask Dong Joo Seong looking for me? Identity card...

998
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:24,720
Over there! Quick chase!

999
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,810
Capture alive!

1000
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:38,890
Shoot his legs!

1001
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:54,950
Kim Woo Jin!

1002
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:01,840
Lee Jeong Chul escape.

1003
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:02,960
What?

1004
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:11,220
Kim Woo Jin!

1005
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:14,640
Lest you believe in Lee Jeong Chul?

1006
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:19,350
The man who betrayed you is Lee Jeong Chul.

1007
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:23,860
Where explosives?

1008
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:27,610
Under your feet.

1009
01:52:29,610 --> 01:52:35,620
It seems to you too gentle treatment. You still look fierce.

1010
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:39,790
Although I do not know how long it took, but quickly slow you'd open your mouth.

1011
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:43,630
Such a thing would never happen.

1012
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:46,340
Will never.

1013
01:52:53,390 --> 01:52:57,640
Gye Yeon Soon is your wife?

1014
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:12,780
Want to hear an interesting story?

1015
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:19,290
Do you think you were arrested because of information from informers?

1016
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,710
But Yeon Gye Soon whose face has never been exposed can be caught,

1017
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:25,750
because of Gye Soon Yeon picture this.

1018
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:30,220
Photographed in the studio of your photos.

1019
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:43,940
I want to see how long you can survive.

1020
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:47,650
Never give up.

1021
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:49,930
Start!

1022
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:12,920
He bit his own tongue.

1023
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,640
Explosives still not been found?

1024
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:20,640
Bucho!

1025
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:22,430
Lee Jeong Chul been caught.

1026
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:34,630
Stand up!

1027
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:48,480
Please sit.

1028
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:53,230
The trial begins today.

1029
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:03,410
The defendant presented.

1030
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:09,620
Lee Jeong Chul.

1031
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,210
Lee Jeong Chul...

1032
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:14,460
Please come forward.

1033
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:37,820
Please provide a statement.

1034
01:56:39,490 --> 01:56:41,910
I had to get the explosives from the hands of Kim Woo Jin

1035
01:56:42,410 --> 01:56:46,490
to be submitted to the police deliberately did not give information in advance.

1036
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,710
His intention to wait after arriving at the central police station

1037
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:54,210
The new all at once destroyed.

1038
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:14,730
I always adhere to the work of the police.

1039
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:22,070
If the mission is successful, I will be promoted to superintendent.

1040
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:27,540
From before engaging in this mission, I'm sure.

1041
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:32,920
I...

1042
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:55,360
As the Japanese police, I just want to contribute.

1043
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:03,700
I'm not a member Uilyeol-and.

1044
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:07,950
I just wanted to take advantage of Kim Woo Jin.

1045
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:16,840
We are not comrades, nor friend.

1046
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,600
I am innocent.

1047
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:59,000
Traitor!

1048
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,960
You're going to hell, dog!

1049
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:05,010
Unfortunately I can not kill you with my own hands.

1050
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:09,800
Hey, Lee Jeong Chul!

1051
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,300
- = A month later = -

1052
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:33,950
Hei, Bisu!

1053
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:41,170
Gye Yeon Soon died this morning.

1054
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:43,150
Why so small?

1055
02:00:44,690 --> 02:00:47,070
The beautiful female prisoners.

1056
02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:53,910
Coming from China. Do not have friends, do not have a family.

1057
02:00:55,990 --> 02:01:01,580
There is no suitable place to bury them, also can not be thrown away.

1058
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:29,280
There is no more time. Come on, quickly! Quick!

1059
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:24,960
A bite untouched. Do not have an appetite?

1060
02:02:35,010 --> 02:02:37,050
Where are you going?

1061
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:42,100
Higashi Bucho mana?

1062
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:44,600
= Tonight there was a dinner appointment. =

1063
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:49,270
= Tonight Police Department held a dinner at a Japanese entertainment clubs. =

1064
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:51,530
Who are the guests at the party tonight?

1065
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:56,320
= Japanese government officials, police officials and officials of Chongdok-bu. =

1066
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:59,280
= Party of Japan overall pro. =

1067
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:36,070
Hyeong!

1068
02:03:39,490 --> 02:03:41,160
Hyeong.

1069
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:46,710
Please help me to secure these explosives.

1070
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:49,920
I'll distract them. You hide explosives.

1071
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,210
You crazy! Until the last second is still ...

1072
02:03:51,210 --> 02:03:53,340
We make an agreement.

1073
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:55,970
If you get caught even have to die can not open his mouth.

1074
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:59,010
To death also can not be admitted as members Uilyeol-and.

1075
02:03:59,010 --> 02:04:01,050
At least one of us has to stay alive.

1076
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:02,390
With new so there is hope for our plan to succeed.

1077
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:05,810
With so our sacrifices will not be in vain.

1078
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:14,820
thanks. Without Hyeong no way I could come this far.

1079
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:22,160
Kill him! Kill him!

1080
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:17,210
Hei!

1081
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:31,970
Semuanya, Higashi Bucho sudah keluar.

1082
02:08:06,590 --> 02:08:09,260
Cheers.

1083
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:27,860
Street!

1084
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:08,500
Police, police ...

1085
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:10,210
The rumors were true?

1086
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:12,010
Calm! Calm!

1087
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:25,400
Hei! Hei, Si bisu!

1088
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:27,270
Have you heard?

1089
02:10:30,650 --> 02:10:33,610
An explosion at a Japanese entertainment clubs.

1090
02:10:33,610 --> 02:10:37,660
Lots of people killed and seriously injured.

1091
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:43,250
He said the atmosphere is chaotic. Like hell on earth.

1092
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:48,090
But I heard he said the explosives were smuggled by Uilyeol-and from Shanghai,

1093
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:51,260
half were not found.

1094
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:57,470
It makes people more frightened.

1095
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:45,310
Yes also, from being seized by the Japanese.

1096
02:11:45,810 --> 02:11:50,610
But there is one thing, if people found out I used my money to finance the military can bring problems.

1097
02:11:50,610 --> 02:11:53,690
You have to promise me. Before independence, it must be kept secret.

1098
02:11:53,690 --> 02:11:57,030
Do you think could be free, Yeonggam?

1099
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:02,200
With the people like you, independence was only a matter of time.

1100
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:08,750
Yeonggam, it costs how much?

1101
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:17,260
These people, in Gyeongseong are more numerous than dogs are a medal of Chongdok-bu.

1102
02:12:20,550 --> 02:12:24,470
If so, try specify approximately how much it costs.

1103
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:28,310
Amount you get by selling Kim Jang Ok.

1104
02:12:33,570 --> 02:12:38,490
Who said that? Jo Dong Hoi Ryeong or Joo Seong?

1105
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:36,000
It kuhadiahkan you.

1106
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,760
You're sure to be successful.

1107
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:49,100
News Danjang-nim okay?

1108
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:52,140
Yes, he was fine.

1109
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:57,820
After hearing what happened with the mission this time, he cried for a long time.

1110
02:13:58,360 --> 02:14:00,860
Then he said something like this:

1111
02:14:00,860 --> 02:14:04,370
"Even if it fails, still persist."

1112
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:08,330
"Hit the failure and keep going forward."

1113
02:14:08,330 --> 02:14:12,210
"It will eventually stand on higher ground."

1114
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:22,800
There was to be conveyed to the Danjang-nim?

1115
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:33,060
Will certainly meet again.

1116
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:12,520
Although unsuccessful, still persist.

1117
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:17,860
Step on the failure and keep going forward.

1118
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:21,280
Will eventually stand on higher ground.

1119
02:15:22,004 --> 02:15:29,004
