1
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,367
THERE'S A PROGRAM BEING SEEN
ON P.B.S. NETWORK AT THE MOMENT.

2
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:23,019
AND IT'S CALLED
"AN AMERICAN FAMILY."

3
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:25,622
AND IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
DOCUMENTARY. IT'S IN 12 PARTS.

4
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,706
AND IT PROBES
THE DAY-TO-DAY LIVES

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,042
OF A FAMILY FROM
SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA.

6
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:31,827
THEY AGREED
TO LET A FILM CREW

7
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,629
LIVE WITH THEM
FOR MONTHS ON END

8
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:36,531
AND THEIR MOST PRIVATE
MOMENTS HAVE BECOME PUBLIC.

9
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:39,835
THE SERIES HAS BEEN WIDELY
REVIEWED AND CRITICIZED.

10
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:42,086
AND NOBODY IS SURE--
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT--

11
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:45,006
WHY THEY LET THEMSELVES IN
FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THEY DID.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,593
BUT THAT'LL BE ONE OF THE THINGS
MAYBE WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT.

13
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:53,180
I HAD THIS VISION
OF THE LOUD FAMILY

14
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:56,650
THAT I JUST
COULDN'T SHAKE--

15
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:58,902
SEVEN PEOPLE

16
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:03,523
STANDING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
IN SOLIDARITY,

17
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:07,744
BONDED BY BLOOD
AND TIME AND LOVE...

18
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:16,585
WITH A HUSBAND AND A FATHER
WHO WAS HOME AND THERE FOR US ALL.

19
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:30,131
¶ STARS SHINING BRIGHT
ABOVE YOU ¶

20
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:33,718
¶ NIGHT BREEZES
SEEM TO WHISPER ¶

21
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:35,853
¶ I LOVE YOU ¶

22
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:40,223
¶ BIRDS SINGING
IN THE SYCAMORE TREE ¶

23
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:45,062
¶ DREAM A LITTLE DREAM
OF ME ¶

24
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:52,035
¶ SAY NIGHTY-NIGHT
AND KISS ME ¶

25
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,070
¶ JUST HOLD ME TIGHT ¶

26
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:57,373
¶ AND TELL ME
YOU'LL MISS ME ¶

27
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,725
¶ WHILE I'M ALONE ¶

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,211
¶ AND BLUE AS CAN BE ¶

29
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:06,882
¶ DREAM A LITTLE DREAM
OF ME ¶

30
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:10,468
¶ STARS FADING ¶

31
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:13,588
¶ BUT I LINGER ON, DEAR ¶

32
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:15,590
¶ STILL CRAVING ¶

33
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:19,144
¶ YOUR KISS ¶

34
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:22,063
¶ I'M LONGING TO LINGER ¶

35
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:24,598
¶ TILL DAWN, DEAR ¶

36
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:29,687
¶ JUST SAYING THIS ¶

37
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:35,142
¶ SWEET DREAMS TILL SUNBEAMS
FIND YOU ¶

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,978
¶ SWEET DREAMS THAT LEAVE
ALL WORRIES ¶

39
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:40,780
¶ BEHIND YOU ¶

40
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:42,865
¶ BUT IN YOUR DREAMS ¶

41
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,451
¶ WHATEVER THEY BE ¶

42
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:50,707
¶ DREAM A LITTLE DREAM
OF ME... ¶

43
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:06,104
¶ DREAM A LITTLE DREAM
OF ME... ¶

44
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,037
- PAT.
- MARY.

45
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,456
OH, RIGHT ON TIME.

46
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,374
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

47
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,243
OH, YOU'LL SEE.

48
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,029
COME, DEAR.
WE'RE SITTING RIGHT UP THERE.

49
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,199
CRAIG.

50
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,089
CRAIG GILBERT,
THIS IS PAT LOUD.

51
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,541
- HELLO.
- A PLEASURE.

52
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,727
- CRAIG'S A VISITOR FROM
THE BIG APPLE. - OH.

53
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,896
- HE'S FRIENDS WITH
MY EDITOR. - WELCOME.

54
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,713
WELL, PLEASE, SIT SIT.

55
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:56,050
CRAIG'S WORKING ON
A VERY INTERESTING PROJECT.

56
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,236
WELL, I MAKE
DOCUMENTARY FILMS, PAT--

57
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,887
NOTHING YOU'D
HAVE HEARD OF.

58
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:02,056
RECENTLY I JUST DID SOMETHING
ON THE WORK OF MARGARET MEAD.

59
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:03,891
SHE'S A WELL-KNOWN
ANTHROPOLOGIST.

60
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,777
YES, SHE WROTE "COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA,"
WHICH I QUITE ENJOYED.

61
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:09,362
- I'M IMPRESSED. - SHE'S
DEAD ON ABOUT GENDER ROLES.

62
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,082
FATHERS ARE BIOLOGICAL NECESSITIES,
BUT SOCIAL ACCIDENTS.

63
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:14,951
SHE ALSO SAID, "I DON'T BELIEVE IN
USING WOMEN IN COMBAT BECAUSE

64
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,420
- THE FEMALES ARE TOO FIERCE."
- "FEMALES ARE TOO FIERCE."

65
00:04:17,455 --> 00:04:21,841
WHY IS IT I THINK WE ALREADY KNOW
MORE ABOUT EACH OTHER THAN WE SHOULD?

66
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,460
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
SHE'S PERFECT.

67
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:27,346
PAT, I WANT TO OBSERVE
AN AMERICAN FAMILY

68
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,049
MUCH LIKE MARGARET
OBSERVED A PRIMITIVE ONE,

69
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,552
EXCEPT THIS TIME I'D LIKE THE CAMERA
TEAM TO MOVE IN WITH THE FAMILY.

70
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:36,554
AND I THINK THAT I FOUND
MY FAMILY LAST NIGHT

71
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:40,108
WHEN MARY TOLD ME ABOUT YOU
AND SHOWED ME

72
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:42,426
THIS WONDERFUL
CHRISTMAS CARD.

73
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:46,430
MM, WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT
TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH A THING?

74
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:49,317
WELL, TO EDUCATE. TO BE PART
OF A BRAVE NEW EXPERIMENT

75
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,702
WITH A REAL FAMILY,
WITH REAL PEOPLE

76
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,737
THAT AUDIENCES
CAN RELATE TO.

77
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:58,292
YOU WERE HIS FIRST CHOICE. I SHOWED
HIM THE CARTERS, THE PERCYS, THE HALLS.

78
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:00,661
THEY'RE ALWAYS
IN HER SOCIETY COLUMN.

79
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:03,630
YES, BUT NONE ARE AS
INTERESTING AS THE LOUD FAMILY.

80
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:07,550
AND HER KIDS--
HER KIDS ARE SO POPULAR.

81
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:10,670
EVERYONE'S ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT THEM.

82
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:18,811
¶ TIME ¶

83
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:21,146
¶ IS ON MY SIDE ¶

84
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,565
¶ YES, IT IS ¶

85
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:26,268
¶ TIME ¶

86
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:28,737
¶ IS ON MY SIDE ¶

87
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:31,639
¶ YES, IT IS ¶

88
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:34,825
¶ NOW YOU WERE SAYING ¶

89
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,077
¶ THAT YOU WANT
TO BE FREE.... ¶

90
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,445
LANCE, WAIT UP.

91
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,331
COME ON, HURRY UP.
I CAN'T MISS IT.

92
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,249
DADDY TRIED TO BE HERE TOO,
YOU KNOW, SWEETIE,

93
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:44,118
BUT HIS BUSINESS TRIP
GOT EXTENDED.

94
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,987
AREN'T THEY ALWAYS?
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

95
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:48,706
- I LOVE YOU.
- OH, COLD NEW YORK NIGHTS--

96
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:50,256
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
A LOW RESISTANCE, BABY.

97
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,841
THEY'RE CLOSING
THE DOOR.  GO.

98
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:53,826
- BYE, LANCE.
- LOVE YOU.

99
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:56,629
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU.
- SAY HI TO ANDY WARHOL FOR ME.

100
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,047
¶ GO AHEAD ¶

101
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:00,967
¶ GO AND LIGHT UP
THAT TOWN ¶

102
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:05,304
¶ AND, BABY, DO EVERYTHING
YOUR HEART DESIRES ¶

103
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:08,724
¶ REMEMBER,
I'LL BE AROUND ¶

104
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:10,475
¶ AND I KNOW ¶

105
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:14,679
¶ LIKE I TOLD YOU
SO MANY TIMES BEFORE ¶

106
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:16,681
¶ OH, YOU'RE GONNA
COME BACK, BABY ¶

107
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,566
¶ YOU'RE GONNA
COME BACK ¶

108
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:22,686
¶ YOU'RE GONNA BE
KNOCK-KNOCKING ON MY DOOR ¶

109
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:25,957
¶ TIME TIME TIME ¶

110
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:28,326
¶ IS ON MY SIDE ¶

111
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,127
- ¶ YES, IT IS.... ¶
- Girl: DAD'S HERE.

112
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:31,963
- HEY, DAD.
- HEY, DAD, WHAT'S UP?

113
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:36,549
- HEY. - LOOKING GOOD.
NICE SUIT, MAN.

114
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:39,302
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE BACK TILL TOMORROW.

115
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,342
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

116
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,927
HEY, JOE NAMATH.

117
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:55,234
- HEY, PATTY?
- HMM?

118
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:57,319
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING
WHEN I GOT HOME TONIGHT?

119
00:06:57,354 --> 00:06:59,054
WHAT'S THAT, BILL?

120
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:02,223
WHEN I SAW THOSE KIDS
PLAYING OUT THERE ON THE LAWN,

121
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:05,994
RUNNING AROUND WITH THE
SUNLIGHT IN THEIR HAIR,

122
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:08,496
I WAS THINKING
WE ARE LIKE--

123
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,666
- YOUR HAIRBRUSH.
- MY HAIRBRUSH?

124
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,003
- IT'S CLEAN.
- AND?

125
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:18,071
- WHO CLEANED IT?
- I CLEANED IT.

126
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,424
YOU'VE NEVER CLEANED YOUR
HAIRBRUSH IN YOUR LIFE.

127
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,243
PATTY, I'VE CLEANED
MY BRUSH BEFORE

128
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:25,295
AND I CLEANED IT
THIS TIME.

129
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,763
WHY?

130
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:30,217
BECAUSE IT HAD
DOG HAIR IN IT.

131
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:33,519
BILL NEVIN'S FOUR-YEAR-OLD
OPENS UP MY SUITCASE

132
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,806
AND BRUSHES HIS GOLDEN
RETRIEVER WITH MY HAIRBRUSH.

133
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:40,476
- UNBELIEVABLE, RIGHT?
- I AGREE.

134
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,094
SO WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO SAY WAS

135
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:45,147
THAT WHEN I WAS OUT THERE
PLAYING FOOTBALL ON THE LAWN,

136
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,483
I WAS THINKING WE'RE LIKE
THE WEST COAST KENNEDYS.

137
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,119
DO YOU MEAN THAT AS
A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING?

138
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:53,488
IT'S A COMPLIMENT,
PATTY.

139
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,324
I'M SAYING WE'VE GOT
A FAMILY TO BE PROUD OF HERE.

140
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,076
IT'S INTERESTING
YOU SHOULD MENTION THAT,

141
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,378
BECAUSE I MET A FILMMAKER
WHO'S LOOKING FOR

142
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,329
THE IDEAL FAMILY
TO PUT ON TV.

143
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,797
REALLY?

144
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:06,250
OF COURSE I TOLD HIM
WE COULDN'T PARTICIPATE,

145
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,785
BEING THAT YOU'RE
AWAY SO MUCH.

146
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:12,956
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

147
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:15,808
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
MORE ABOUT THIS.

148
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:18,461
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU KNEW ALICE.

149
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,796
SHE WAS MY SOPHOMORE
ROOMMATE AT STANFORD.

150
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:22,682
HER BROTHER JIMMY WAS
IN MY HOUSE AT HARVARD.

151
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,183
OH MY,
WHAT A SMALL WORLD.

152
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:26,102
SO, BILL,
WHERE DID YOU STUDY?

153
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:29,322
I MATRICULATED AT
THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS.

154
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:31,139
YES, BILL WASN'T
MUCH OF A STUDENT,

155
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:34,192
BUT HE MAKES MORE MONEY
THAN MOST IVY LEAGUERS.

156
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:36,745
YOU KNOW WHAT THE SECRET IS?
YOU GOTTA LOVE IT.

157
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,530
IF YOU DON'T LOVE IT,
YOU CAN'T SELL IT.

158
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:41,116
GOD HELP ME, YOU CAN
LAUGH IF YOU WANT,

159
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,952
BUT I LOVE STRIP MINES AND
I LOVE SELLING SHOVEL TEETH.

160
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:45,703
IT'S LIKE BROADWAY,
BABY.

161
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:47,321
MR. GILBERT SAW "HAIR"
ON BROADWAY.

162
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,256
HE SAID IT WAS LIKE
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.

163
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,875
YEAH, MR. GILBERT KNOWS
MICK JAGGER TOO.

164
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:52,659
YOUR BOYS HAVE
PROMISED ME A CONCERT.

165
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:54,929
WAIT UNTIL YOU MEET LANCE.
HE'S THE COOLEST OF US ALL.

166
00:08:54,963 --> 00:08:57,431
- BUT HE MOVED TO NEW YORK.
- TO MEET ANDY WARHOL.

167
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,300
WELL, WE CAN SHOOT HIM
IN NEW YORK.

168
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:00,833
BUT HE'S NOT
IN THE HOUSE,

169
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:02,018
AND THAT'S WHAT
THE SHOW IS, RIGHT--

170
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,803
WHAT GOES ON
IN THE HOUSE?

171
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:06,973
THE HOUSE, THE SCHOOL, THE SUPERMARKET,
WHEREVER THE FAMILY GOES.

172
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:10,360
- WHAT ABOUT THE BATHROOM?
- NO NO.

173
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,112
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT IS OFF-LIMITS?

174
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:13,863
WHY, BILL?  YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO HIDE?

175
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,066
WELL, NO, THAT'S
A FAIR QUESTION--

176
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:18,534
THE THRESHOLD
OF PRIVACY.

177
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:20,685
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE
TO DISCUSS AND DECIDE UPON.

178
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:22,371
WHAT ABOUT PAYMENT?

179
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:24,706
NO NO.  THE PUBLIC
HAS TO BE CERTAIN

180
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:26,408
THERE'S NO MANIPULATION
GOING ON.

181
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,477
I DON'T KNOW THEN. I STILL
DON'T SEE ANY UPSIDE TO IT.

182
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:32,296
COME ON, DAD.
IT'LL BE SO MUCH FUN.

183
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:36,634
WELL, YOU MIGHT,
WHEN YOU SEE JOHNNY HALL

184
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:39,554
AS THE HEAD OF THE MOST
FAMOUS HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA.

185
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:40,721
- JOHNNY HALL?
- MM.

186
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:43,007
WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT HIS FAMILY?

187
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,008
HIS WIFE HAS GOT
A MUSTACHE

188
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,927
AND HIS KIDS ARE
PRACTICALLY BRAIN DEAD.

189
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,929
DAD!

190
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,899
- SO THAT WOULD BE A YES?
- YES.

191
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:56,886
WHEN BILL WOULD
GO AWAY,

192
00:09:56,904 --> 00:10:01,056
I WAS JUST LEFT AT HOME
WITH MY OWN WORST FEARS.

193
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:03,359
FINALLY I DECIDED THAT...

194
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:07,079
WHAT I NEEDED TO DO
WAS TO KEEP BILL HOME

195
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:10,533
AND SHOW HIM
AND THE WORLD

196
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,901
THAT HIS FAMILY WAS
AN INDESTRUCTIBLE THING.

197
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,088
GENTLEMEN, MEET THE LOUDS.

198
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:19,591
THE HANDSOME, HARD-WORKING,
NIXON-SUPPORTING DAD,

199
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,426
THE SMART,
SULTRY MOM.

200
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,428
SHE'S A LITTLE TOO LATE
FOR WOMEN'S LIB,

201
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:25,547
BUT TOO YOUNG TO BE
A DISCARDED HOUSEWIFE.

202
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,515
THE 16 YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER

203
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,350
WHO IS EXPERIENCING
HER FIRST SERIOUS BOYFRIEND.

204
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:32,636
THE LITTLE ONE WHO IS IN LOVE
WITH HER HORSE.

205
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:35,755
THE TWO BOYS WHO THINK
THEY'RE THE NEXT ROLLING STONES.

206
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:38,142
AND THE ELDEST-- HE'S MOVED
TO MANHATTAN TO MAKE IT.

207
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:40,227
I HAVE YET
TO MEET HIM.

208
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,428
WHY NO APPLAUSE HERE,
GENTLEMEN?

209
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:44,897
FOR WHAT, FIVE HOURS OF
"PASS THE SALT"? I DON'T GET THE POINT.

210
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:46,899
THE POINT IS WE'VE GONE
TO THE MOON AND BEYOND,

211
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,785
BUT WE HAVE YET TO GET PAST
THE AMERICAN FRONT DOOR.

212
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,370
AND WHEN WE GET
PAST THAT DOOR,

213
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:52,955
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE'RE GOING TO FIND?

214
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,607
THE SMILING FACES
ON THE CHRISTMAS CARDS?

215
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,492
THE CUTE LITTLE JOKES
WITH THE LAUGH TRACKS?  NO.

216
00:10:57,543 --> 00:11:00,445
NOW ONE HAS EVER
DONE THIS BEFORE,

217
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,714
SO IF ANYONE SHOULD BE
ASKING WHAT THE POINT IS,

218
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:05,116
IT SHOULD BE ME--
OF HAVING TO BEG TO FINANCE

219
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:07,085
WHAT COULD BE
THE MOST GROUNDBREAKING

220
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,671
10 HOURS OF TV
EVER PUT ON THE AIR.

221
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:12,256
- 10 HOURS?
- YEAH.  YOU HEARD THAT.

222
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,790
I HEARD THAT, YES.

223
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,559
WELL, YOU JUST REMEMBER
THIS LAUGH

224
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:18,095
WHEN YOU SEE THE DAILIES
AND YOU'RE BEGGING ME FOR MORE.

225
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:19,930
ALL RIGHT, CRAIG, I'M GONNA
TAKE YOU UP ON THAT.

226
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:22,900
IF I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE REST OF THE FINANCING,

227
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:25,519
I NEED YOU HERE
TO SCREEN DAILIES

228
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,687
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,
SO WE CAN BE SURE

229
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:29,489
YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING
WORTH PUTTING ON.

230
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,074
- ABSOLUTELY.
- MR. GILBERT.

231
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,076
YOUR ASSISTANT PUT
A PHONE CALL THROUGH.

232
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,696
- THIS PICKS UP EVERYTHING? - MM-HMM,
I'M GONNA WRAP THIS AROUND RIGHT HERE.

233
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:39,532
YEAH, WE'LL BE PUTTING IN
SOME HIGHER-WATTAGE BULBS.

234
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,950
PAT, I WAS JUST
DESCRIBING YOU

235
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:44,086
AND I USED AN ADJECTIVE
THAT ACTUALLY MADE ME BLUSH.

236
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,820
Why aren't you here,
Craig?

237
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,207
MY HOUSE IS BEING TORN APART
BY A BUNCH OF NEW YORKERS.

238
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:49,841
They're just
prerigging a little.

239
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,627
WHEN THEY'RE DONE
YOU'LL HARDLY NOTICE.

240
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:53,462
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT YOU
FILMING MY TRIP TO MANHATTAN?

241
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,180
THEY SAY YOU WANT
TO START WITH THAT NOW?

242
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,598
WELL, YOU DECIDED TO VISIT
YOUR SON AND WE THOUGHT
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING.

243
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,017
By the way, where is Lance?
Where is he staying?

244
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,669
OH, UM,

245
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,804
I BELIEVE HE'S STAYING
AT A PLACE CALLED

246
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:06,340
THE, UH, CHELSEA HOTEL.

247
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,783
LANCE?

248
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,654
WE'RE GOING TO THE
LA MAMA THEATER TONIGHT--

249
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:22,289
THE ULTIMATE
OF UNDERGROUND, HONEY.

250
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:23,907
YOU'LL JUST THINK
IT'S SO NEAT.

251
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,575
YEAH, ALL THE UNDERGROUND
STARS ARE THERE. IT'S A BIG PLACE.

252
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:28,911
ALL THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.

253
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:31,664
OH, I KNOW, BUT YOU'VE
DREAMED OF THEM.

254
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:33,499
¶ GOT TO PAY
YOUR DUES ¶

255
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,334
¶ IF YOU WANT
TO SING THE BLUES ¶

256
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:39,204
¶ AND YOU KNOW
IT DON'T COME EASY ¶

257
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:42,257
¶ BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHOUT... ¶

258
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,208
WHAT'VE WE GOT?

259
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:45,977
UH, FIVE-SIX.

260
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:48,062
I THINK THIS IS HER.

261
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:50,348
- YEAH.
- SLATE IT.

262
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:51,882
ROLLING IT.

263
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,568
AN AMERICAN FAMILY,
TAKE ONE.

264
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:55,102
GOT IT.

265
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,654
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA NEED
THAT SUN GUN WHEN WE GO IN THERE.

266
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,157
- THAT LOBBY'S TOO DARK.
- YEAH.

267
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:04,895
WE'RE STARTING
RIGHT NOW?

268
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:07,998
YEAH, JUST KEEP ON COMING.
REMEMBER, WE'RE INVISIBLE.

269
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:09,782
YOU'RE RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME.

270
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,917
IT'S OKAY. JUST KEEP WALKING.
WE'LL GIVE WAY.

271
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:13,902
AND TRY NOT TO TALK
TO THE CAMERA, PAT.

272
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,904
DOES YOUR MOTHER
HAVE DARK HAIR,

273
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:18,424
LONG, SEXY LEGS,
HUGE SUNGLASSES

274
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,092
AND CAMERAS
FOLLOWING HER?

275
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:22,295
OR IS THAT
JACKIE O?

276
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:25,263
OH MY GOD,
LOOK AT THEM.

277
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:27,799
THIS IS HEAVEN.

278
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:34,105
OH, EXCUSE ME.

279
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,474
OH, JACKIE O.

280
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,893
HEY, BABY.
WANT SOME?

281
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,899
HELLO.  THE NAME'S
PATRICIA LOUD.

282
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,485
MY SON MADE A RESERVATION
FOR ME ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.

283
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,271
YEAH, HE WANTED YOU
ON EIGHT.

284
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:58,211
LANCE.

285
00:13:58,245 --> 00:13:59,829
- BABY.
- HI, MOM.

286
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,831
- OH, HOW ARE YOU?
- FINE, MOM.

287
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,583
OH, THIS IS CAMERON,
MOM.

288
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,134
HI.  HELLO.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

289
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,470
- I LOVE YOUR GLOVES.
- YEAH, YOU LOOK NICE.

290
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:09,788
- HONEY, YOU SAID--
- HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT, MRS. LOUD?

291
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:11,790
- YEAH.
- FINE FINE.

292
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:14,393
YES, WE GOT IN A LITTLE
EARLIER THAN EXPECTED.

293
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:17,262
- OH.
- WHO SMOKES?

294
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,348
WELL, CAMERON SMOKES.
CAMERON, YOU TELL--

295
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,650
THAT'S--
I'M THE SMOKER.

296
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:24,018
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S
HIS MOTHER'S PROBLEM.

297
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:27,321
JUST SO LONG AS YOU
DON'T START.

298
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:31,475
- THIS PLACE COULD USE SOME
CLEANING. - UH, I KNOW.

299
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:34,161
THE MAID SERVICE HERE REALLY
IS JUST AWFUL, JUST TERRIBLE.

300
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:36,947
WELL, PERHAPS YOU OUGHT
TO APPLY FOR THE JOB.

301
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:38,698
I APPLIED FOR THE--
FOR THE CLEANING JOB,

302
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:40,283
BUT THEY SAID I HAD TO
WEAR A HAIR NET,

303
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:42,535
AND I JUST
COULDN'T DO THAT.

304
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,505
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER
ABOUT THE SHOW?

305
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,207
OH, UM, YEAH.

306
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:50,543
WE-- WE GOT TICKETS TO THIS
AMAZING SHOW AT LA MAMA THEATER--

307
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,378
- "VAIN VICTORY."
- THANK YOU.

308
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,096
I'D LOVE TO TAKE IN
A NICE SHOW.

309
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,882
OH, MOM, I KNOW SO MANY FAMOUS
AND INTERESTING PEOPLE NOW.

310
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,183
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

311
00:14:58,218 --> 00:15:00,936
LIKE JACKIE CURTIS
AND CANDY--

312
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,771
SHE'S RIGHT THERE.
SHE'S STARRING IN IT.

313
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:05,507
- OH, SHE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS?
- SHE WANTS TO MARRY HIM ACTUALLY.

314
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:07,174
- REALLY?
- OH YEAH.

315
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:08,443
SHE THINKS HE'S
THE ALL-AMERICAN BOY

316
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:10,678
AND SHE'S
THE ALL-AMERICAN GIRL.

317
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:11,813
SHE'S VERY PRETTY.

318
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:14,515
SO DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO YOUR ROOM NOW,

319
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:15,783
GO UP?

320
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:17,485
YOU SAID I'D BE
NEXT DOOR TO YOU.

321
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,870
WHY AM I UP THERE?

322
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:20,288
BECAUSE IT'S
BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU

323
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:24,207
TO SWEEP IN THE DOOR
LIKE LORETTA YOUNG, YOU KNOW.

324
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:29,362
THERE'S A CAMERA.

325
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,531
MY GOD, A CAMERA.
I HAD NO IDEA.

326
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:34,134
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE INVISIBLE
JUST LIKE THEY SAID YOU'D BE.

327
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,669
LISTEN, WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

328
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:37,336
NICE TO MEET YOU.

329
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:47,980

333
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,243

341
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:31,304

CANDY,

342
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:33,973
THE ONE WHO WANTS
TO MARRY YOU?

343
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,057
YES.

344
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:39,478
HMM.
SHE'S A MAN?

345
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:42,197

THAT WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED

349
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,270
BY A CAMERA CREW,
LANCE, RIGHT?

350
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:52,272
DID YOU TAKE THAT
INTO CONSIDERATION

351
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,875
BEFORE YOU BROUGHT ME
HERE TONIGHT?

352
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,377
YES.

I'M GONNA GO NOW,
SWEETIE.

358
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,591
ALL RIGHT.

359
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,345
ONE MUST NEVER LET THE
PUBLIC BEHIND THE SCENES,

360
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:17,514
FOR THEY ARE
EASILY DISILLUSIONED

361
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:20,632
AND THEN THEY'RE
ANGRY WITH YOU.

362
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,685
FOR IT IS THE ILLUSION
THEY LOVE.

363
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,825
PAT, HELLO.
SORRY I'M LATE.

364
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:33,327
CRAIG.  DID YOU KNOW
THAT THEY WERE TAKING ME
TO SEE THIS?

365
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:35,496
OH, OF COURSE NOT. I HAD
NO IDEA THAT WAS HAPPENING.

366
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:38,332
OH, IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
TRANSVESTITES?

367
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:39,917
THIS ALL GOT
STARTED OFF WRONG.

368
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:42,319
IF THIS SEQUENCE UPSETS YOU,
WE DON'T HAVE TO USE IT.

369
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:43,654
IT'S NOT ME.
IT'S BILL.

370
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:45,373
IF HE EVER SAW THIS
HE'D HAVE A STROKE.

371
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:47,325
DON'T MAKE HIM LOOK
FOOLISH, CRAIG.

372
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,442
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
LET ME JUST SAY SOMETHING.

373
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:52,462
I THINK LANCE IS AMAZING AND
I CAN TELL MY CREW DOES TOO.

374
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:55,849
HE'S SMART AND HE'S WITTY
AND HE'S INCREDIBLY SPECIAL.

375
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:58,101
WELL, I KNOW ALL THAT.

376
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:00,220
I'M JUST SCARED--

377
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:02,972
THESE PEOPLE,
THIS PLACE.

378
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:04,807
WELL, HE'S TRYING
TO FIND HIMSELF

379
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:07,443
AND MANHATTAN IS
THE PLACE TO DO THAT.

380
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:11,280
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?
- YES.

381
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:13,399
NOW ARE YOU OKAY?

382
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:20,038
WELL, I'D GIVE YOU A HUG, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO SEEM INAPPROPRIATE.

383
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:22,023
WELL, I TELL YOU,

384
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,358
THERE REALLY IS
SOMETHING LIBERATING

385
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:26,578
ABOUT GETTING
OUT OF TOWN.

386
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:29,163
FOR ONCE IT'S ALL
IN BILL'S LAP.

387
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:31,799
WELL, HIS TRAVELING
MUST BE HARD ON YOU.

388
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:36,202
YES, IT'S HARD
ON ALL OF US.

389
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,472
DO YOU GET LONELY?

390
00:18:38,506 --> 00:18:41,558
WELL, IT'S ALL...

391
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,562
VERY COMPLICATED.

392
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:47,930
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
I UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF.

393
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:49,882
WELL, MAYBE THE SHOW
CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

394
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,935
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT SAY
WHEN YOU TURN A CAMERA ON THINGS,

395
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:55,721
THE TRUTH JUST RISES
TO THE SURFACE.

396
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,239
WHAT, LIKE DUMPLINGS?

397
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:01,776
SO...

398
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:05,030
DO YOU HAVE
A WIFE AND KIDS?

399
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:06,581
NO NO.

400
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:08,917
MY MARRIAGE COLLAPSED.

401
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:10,702
OH.

402
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:13,171
YES, IT TURNED OUT THAT
WE WEREN'T THE RIGHT FIT.

403
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:14,422
I'M SORRY.

404
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,457
YES, IT WAS--

405
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:19,460
WELL, THERE REALLY ARE
NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT.

406
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:21,462
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME
AS A MAN

407
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:24,848
THAT WOULD EVER BE
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS.

408
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:27,968
IN THIS CASE I AM.

409
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:32,889
UM...

410
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,224
THE ADJECTIVE?

411
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,478
WELL, YOU USED A WORD
TO DESCRIBE ME.

412
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:41,114
ON THE PHONE
YOU MENTIONED--

413
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:44,784
WELL, I GET FLOWERY
WHEN I'M IN MY SELLING MODE.

414
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:49,154
WELL, WHAT WAS THE WORD?

415
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:52,157
IT WAS "SULTRY."

416
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,293
- SULTRY?
- MM-HMM.

417
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,295
BUT I SAID SMART TOO.

418
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,881
I LIKE SULTRY.

419
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:05,336
It's kind of late there.

420
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:07,454
Have you been prowling
the streets all night?

421
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,374
- LANCE TOOK ME TO A SHOW.
- How's he doing?

422
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,345
- FOUND A JOB YET?
- No, but he's making lots of friends.

423
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:16,563
GOOD GOOD.
ANY GIRLS?

424
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:18,297
THAT'S STILL
MY HOPE, YOU KNOW,

425
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:20,266
THAT IF HE COULD JUST
MEET THE RIGHT GIRL AND--

426
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,018
YOU KNOW,
I THINK HE HAS.

427
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:23,987
Really?

428
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:26,106
YES, SHE WAS
IN THE SHOW TONIGHT.

429
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,474
Well, finally some
encouraging news.

430
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:30,359
WHAT ELSE? HAS THAT
GILBERT BEEN AROUND?

431
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:34,363
UH, MM-HMM.

432
00:20:34,414 --> 00:20:38,150
- You betcha. - HOW MUCH HAVE
YOU HAD TO DRINK, PATTY?

433
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:41,486
ENOUGH TO PUT ME TO SLEEP.

434
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:45,373
I LOVE IT HERE, MOM.

435
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:49,043
I WISH I COULD STAY
AT THE CHELSEA FOREVER.

436
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:54,665
YOU REALLY NEVER FELT AT HOME
IN SANTA BARBARA, DID YOU?

437
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:56,634
I MEAN,
LOOKING BACK ON IT,

438
00:20:56,668 --> 00:21:00,837
THERE WERE THINGS THAT
I COULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY,

439
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:05,308
BUT I JUST ALWAYS FELT
THAT I STOOD APART

440
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:08,311
FROM THE REST
OF THE FAMILY SO MUCH.

441
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:11,982
I MEAN, MAYBE YOU GUYS
COULD'VE--

442
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:15,651
COULD'VE WHAT?

443
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:17,903
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

444
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:20,489
DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.
IT'S ALL OKAY NOW.

445
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,410
BY THE WAY, DAD WANTS
TO PASS THROUGH NEW YORK

446
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:26,245
ON ONE OF HIS
UPCOMING TRIPS.

447
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:30,198
DO ME A FAVOR-- DON'T GET HIM
A ROOM AT THE CHELSEA HOTEL.

448
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:32,217
YOU KNOW, I STILL NEVER
KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.

449
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,918
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK
TO YOUR FATHER.

450
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:36,871
HE'S SUCH A CONVERSATIONALIST,
HE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE WHOLE THING.

451
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:40,508
BUT THAT'S NOT
ACTUALLY TALKING, MOM.

452
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:43,060
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S KILLING TIME.

453
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:46,063
WELL, SOMETIMES

454
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,849
THAT'S THE BEST
YOU CAN ASK FOR.

455
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:00,893
THE BOYS
ARE SO SO LAZY.

456
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:04,864
BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY TO
LEAD THEM AS FAR AS YOU CAN.

457
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:08,251
YOU STILL HAVE ALL THAT
HEAVY EQUIPMENT TO GET?

458
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,621
OH, HELLO.

459
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:13,238
WELCOME HOME,
PATRICIA.

460
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:15,406
OH, YOU'RE A VISION.

461
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,261
DID YOU MAKE YOUR
CONNECTING FLIGHT OKAY?

462
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,429
WHY, YES, WE DID.

463
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:26,801
OH.

464
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:28,602
DID YOU MAKE YOUR
CONNECTING FLIGHT OKAY?

465
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:30,104
YES.

466
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:32,439
HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU GUYS
TO LUNCH? YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED.

467
00:22:32,474 --> 00:22:34,608
THEY CAN'T SPEAK TO YOU
WHEN THEY'RE FILMING, BILL.

468
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:36,277
OH, TAKE TWO.

469
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,696
HOW ABOUT I TAKE MY
BEAUTIFUL WIFE TO LUNCH?

470
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,899
- ON CAMERA OR OFF?
- MY LIFE'S AN OPEN BOOK.

471
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:45,285
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
WE'LL PUT A LITTLE CAMI BEHIND IT

472
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,403
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE
ABSOLUTELY FINE.

473
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:50,540
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MINUTE?

474
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:52,292
MICHELLE,
WOULD YOU PLEASE?

475
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:55,245
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TRY IT ON?

476
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,714
PATS.
PATSY.

477
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:01,683
- VAL, HI.
- HI THERE, VAL.

478
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:04,119
- BILL.
- HI THERE, VAL.

479
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:06,338
SO I WAS GOING
TO CALL YOU.

480
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:07,789
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO?

481
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:10,008
OH, JUST GRABBING
A BITE AT EL PASEO.

482
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:11,893
WELL, DO STOP BY
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

483
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:13,978
I CAN SET YOU UP
WITH A NEW SPRING OUTFIT,

484
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:16,180
COMPLETE WITH PURSE,
HAT AND SHOES,

485
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:17,598
ALL ON THE HOUSE.

486
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:19,466
OH MY GOODNESS.
WHY?

487
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:22,737
BECAUSE I'D LOVE AMERICA TO
SEE MY NEW SPRING LINE IS WHY.

488
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:26,406
AND BILL PROMISED HE COULD
GET ME A WARDROBE CREDIT.

489
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,909
OH, THAT'S MY BILL.

490
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:31,027
- DID I?
- ALWAYS FULL OF PROMISES.

491
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,613
WELL WELL WELL,
IT'S AMERICA'S PERFECT FAMILY.

492
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:37,317
- HI THERE, JEREMY. HOW'S IT GOING?
- HI, BILL.

493
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:39,669
- SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
- HI.

494
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:42,338
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE A MOVIE STAR?

495
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:44,990
WELL...

496
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,345
YOU GOT A NICE TAN
WHILE I WAS AWAY.

497
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:52,131
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,
KIDDO.

498
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,933
THIS STRIKE'S
GONNA DO ME IN.

499
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,383
ARE WE GONNA
GO BROKE, BILL?

500
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,887
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.
LANCE LIVING IT UP IN NEW YORK--

501
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,772
I HOPE HE KNOWS HE'S
ON A SHORT STRING THERE.

502
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,774
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY ANYMORE.

503
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,675
HE LOVES MANHATTAN.

504
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,362
HE'S SO HAPPY HE BURSTS
INTO SONG SOMETIMES.

505
00:24:07,396 --> 00:24:09,280
HE HAS SUCH
A SPARK OF LIFE,

506
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,315
LIKE NO ONE
I'VE EVER KNOWN,

507
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,233
SO OPEN AND FUNNY.

508
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:14,785
THAT'S GREAT,

509
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:17,020
BUT HE'S GOT TO START
THINKING ABOUT A JOB TOO.

510
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,039
THESE KIDS GOT TO LEARN
THE VALUE OF WORK.

511
00:24:19,073 --> 00:24:22,859
I TELL GRANT THAT HE CAN
MAKE $10 AN HOUR

512
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:25,211
HAULING CEMENT FOR DAVID WITZELL,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES?

513
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:27,413
HE GIVES ME THAT
WOLFMAN JACK DOG CALL--

514
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:29,531
"NO WAY, BROTHER.
NO WAY.

515
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,052
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE AND
I'M PLAYING WITH THE BAND."

516
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:35,888
THAT BAND IS
HIS DREAM, BILL.

517
00:24:35,923 --> 00:24:38,040
WELL, OKAY, BUT HOW ABOUT
FINDING A DREAM

518
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:40,375
THAT BRINGS IN
SOME BUCKS?

519
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:47,098
WELL, HOW ABOUT
RAISING PEOPLE

520
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:49,100
THAT HAVE A SHOT
AT BEING HAPPY?

521
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:57,491
HOW ABOUT HAVING PARENTS
THAT MAKE CERTAIN

522
00:24:57,525 --> 00:24:59,944
THEIR KIDS KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG,

523
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:01,612
WHAT THEY SHOULD
AND SHOULDN'T DO?

524
00:25:01,663 --> 00:25:04,564
I THINK THAT WOULD BE
NICE TOO, DON'T YOU?

525
00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:08,835
I KNOW THESE GUYS THINK
YOUR LITTLE ESCAPADE

526
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:10,586
IN NEW YORK
WAS MORE EXCITING

527
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:13,006
THAN FILMING ME
HOLDING DOWN THE FORT HERE,

528
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,291
BUT BELIEVE ME,
THIS WEEK OF BABYSITTING

529
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:19,595
GAVE ME A BETTER IDEA OF
WHAT GOES ON WHEN I'M GONE.

530
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,414
REALLY?
LIKE WHAT?

531
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,298
LIKE A 16-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER

532
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:25,717
THAT STAYS OUT HALF THE NIGHT
AFTER A DANCE PRACTICE--

533
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:29,554
2:00 A.M.
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT, PAT?

534
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:32,924
SURE, IT'S FUN AND EASY
BEING FRIENDS WITH YOUR KIDS,

535
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:36,594
BUT HOW ABOUT GIVING THEM
A LITTLE STRUCTURE?

536
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:42,599
THIS CONVERSATION
WILL END RIGHT HERE.

537
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:45,436
I'LL SPEAK TO CRAIG
IN THE MORNING

538
00:25:45,454 --> 00:25:47,655
ABOUT DROPPING THIS
FROM THE FILM.

539
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,125
BAIT ME IN FRONT
OF THE CAMERA AGAIN

540
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,660
AND YOU'LL BE
VERY VERY SORRY, BILL.

541
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,719
So you let her walk off
just like that?

542
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:05,288
CRAIG, SHE LEFT
ON HER OWN VOLITION.

543
00:26:05,306 --> 00:26:07,589
I CAN'T INTERFERE WITH
THE EVENTS AS THEY'RE HAPPENING.

544
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:09,008
WELL, YOU COULD'VE
FOLLOWED HER.

545
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,343
There was finally
genuine drama unfolding

546
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:12,627
AND YOU DIDN'T
GET IT ON FILM.

547
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:14,430
BELIEVE ME,
WE GOT PLENTY ON FILM.

548
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:17,433
Well, actually I think you
barely scratched the surface.

549
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,967
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE
THIS ATTITUDE.

550
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:20,519
This isn't about
an attitude.

551
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,470
THIS IS ABOUT
DOCUMENTARY ETHICS.

552
00:26:22,488 --> 00:26:24,472
Alan, your job is
to film the Louds--

553
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,492
NO JUDGMENTS, NO INVOLVEMENTS,
NO PERSONAL FEELINGS.

554
00:26:27,526 --> 00:26:31,145
- I know-- - THAT'S WHAT W.N.E.T.
CONTRACTED YOU FOR

555
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:34,449
AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR
ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY LIES.

556
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:36,166
SO LET'S GET
ON THE SAME PAGE HERE

557
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,952
AND YOU SHOOT WHAT I NEED
TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL FILM.

558
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:41,821
- HAVE A NICE DAY.
THANK YOU. - Okay, Craig--

559
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,207
WHEN CRAIG GILBERT
HIRED US,

560
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:46,626
WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT
WE WERE GETTING INTO.

561
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,128
FIRST OF ALL,
WE WERE JUST MARRIED

562
00:26:48,162 --> 00:26:50,763
AND I THINK WE HAD SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE EXOTIC IN MIND

563
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:53,132
FOR OUR HONEYMOON THAN
A ROOMFUL OF FILM EQUIPMENT.

564
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,934
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

565
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:57,770
THE SUBJECT MATTER, I THINK--
FOR ME ANYWAY.

566
00:26:57,804 --> 00:27:00,723
FOR ME IT WAS THE CHANCE
TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING PURE--

567
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:03,359
CINEMA VERITE,
THE CINEMA OF TRUTH.

568
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:05,527
HEY, DAD,
YOUR TAXI'S HERE.

569
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:07,529
- OKAY, HONEY.

570
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:10,065
ALL RIGHT,
I GOTTA GO.

571
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:11,516
HELLO?

572
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:14,536
HI, LANCE!

573
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,654
GUYS, IT'S LANCE.
HE'S CALLING COLLECT.

574
00:27:16,688 --> 00:27:18,323
ACCEPT THE CHARGES,
SWEETIE.

575
00:27:18,357 --> 00:27:20,024
- HELLO?
- Hi!

576
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,191
HI, GUYS.

577
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:23,360
I have very
exciting news.

578
00:27:23,378 --> 00:27:24,878
WHAT IS IT, HONEY?
DID YOU GET A JOB?

579
00:27:24,913 --> 00:27:26,530
I'M GOING TO PARIS.

580
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:30,217
- PARIS?
- HE GOT A JOB IN PARIS?

581
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:31,919
LANCE, ARE YOU
IN HIGH SPIRITS AGAIN?

582
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,837
Am I-- am I--?
Yes, I am in high spirits!

583
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:36,705
LANCE, LANCE,
IT'S DAD.

584
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,674
- Hi, Dad. - WHAT ARE
YOU DOING IN PARIS?

585
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:41,677
I AM DOING STREET THEATER.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

586
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:44,480
I'M DOING IT WITH THIS
REALLY REALLY SUPER
GROUP OF PEOPLE.

587
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:46,849
IS THAT ONE OF THOSE
"UP WITH PEOPLE" KIND OF DEALS?

588
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:49,768
You know, I didn't ask,
but I tell them how great you are,

589
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:51,653
not that I don't say
that Mother isn't.

590
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:54,156
In fact, I think I say that
Mother's a bit greater even than you,

591
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,907
but you know what I mean.
Hold on a second.

592
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:59,244
HEY, GUYS,
GET ME A TOASTED ALMOND.

593
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,445
OKAY, HONEY.

594
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:04,498
- CATCH.
- OH, WE'RE RICH!

595
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:07,034
- Lance.
- WHAT?

596
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:09,453
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHO'S FINANCING THIS TRIP.

597
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:11,422
OH, UH,

598
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,424
THIS REALLY
REALLY NICE,

599
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:17,511
VERY RICH MAN WHOSE NAME
I DON'T REMEMBER.

600
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:20,263
- HE'S NOT GOING TO PARIS.
- Maybe it's--  oh, I don't know.

601
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:23,249
- I GOTTA GO.
- Paul or John or Ringo

602
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:24,434
OR SOMETHING.

603
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:25,935
HE'S NOT GOING
TO PARIS.

604
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,271
HONEY, YOUR FATHER SAYS
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PARIS.

605
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:30,423
I'M ACTUALLY FLATTERED.

606
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:33,109
NO ONE'S EVER
TOLD ME THAT BEFORE.

607
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:37,930
Lance, honey,
how are you really?

608
00:28:37,964 --> 00:28:40,899
Have you been taking
care of that cold?

609
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:42,934
I JUST NEED YOU TO BE
A LITTLE MORE PATIENT.

610
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:45,871
YOU'RE BURNING 18 ROLLS
OF FILM PER DAY.

611
00:28:45,905 --> 00:28:49,323
YOU'RE WAY OVER BUDGET AND
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH DRAMA.

612
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,159
NOW I THINK WE'VE BEEN
MORE THAN PATIENT.

613
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,127
A HUGE PART OF THIS PROCESS
IS ESTABLISHING

614
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:56,714
A COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE SUBJECT AND THE CAMERA.

615
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:59,217
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HEAD OUT TO SANTA BARBARA

616
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:01,802
AND JUST PUSH THAT
RELATIONSHIP ALONG.

617
00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:05,288
WELCOME HOME.

618
00:29:05,306 --> 00:29:07,924
OH MY GOD.

619
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:11,311
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? TO HELL
AND BACK? - YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

620
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:13,313
I'VE BEEN BAKING ON A
JOB SITE FOR THREE DAYS.

621
00:29:13,347 --> 00:29:15,398
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL ME, KEMOSABE?

622
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:17,267
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
JUST A SHORT TRIP.

623
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:19,268
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T GET A FREE MINUTE.

624
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:21,320
IT'S BAD OUT THERE,
PATTY.

625
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:23,355
KERN COUNTY QUARRY
HAD TO CLOSE DOWN

626
00:29:23,406 --> 00:29:25,357
BECAUSE THE TEAMSTERS
HAVE JOINED THE STRIKE

627
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:27,359
AND I GOT $200,000
WORTH OF EQUIPMENT

628
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,994
SITTING ON A DOCK
IN GALVESTON.

629
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:31,146
WE CAN'T HIDE IT, MOM.
THEY'VE GOT TO START HAMMERING.

630
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:33,414
MAN, ARE YOU BURNED.

631
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:36,334
HIDE WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

632
00:29:36,368 --> 00:29:39,820
WELCOME TO
WOODSTOCK WEST, MAN.

633
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:41,756
A NEW ROCK GROUP IS GONNA
BREAK HERE ON SATURDAY.

634
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,708
YEAH, IT'LL HELP US GET
SOME GIGS THIS SUMMER.

635
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,260
YOU HAVE A GIG
THIS SUMMER, GRANT--

636
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:47,294
HAULING CEMENT IN ORANGE
COUNTY FOR DAVID WITZELL.

637
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,795
I DON'T THINK SO.

638
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,497
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
POURING CEMENT, GRANT.

639
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:52,933
I'M PUTTING YOU TO WORK TOO.
LOOKS LIKE YOUR SUMMER BUSINESS TRIP

640
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,669
IS TO AUSTRALIA WITH BIG TODD TO
HELP HIM PICK UP SOME NEW CLIENTS.

641
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:57,671
WAIT, HE GOES TO AUSTRALIA
AND I SHOVEL CEMENT?

642
00:29:57,689 --> 00:29:59,172
DO I LOOK LIKE
CEMENT GUY?

643
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,141
DO I LOOK LIKE
ARISTOTLE ONASSIS?

644
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,942
- WHO DO YOU THINK PAYS
FOR ALL THIS? - WE DID.

645
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:04,510
- YOU DID?
- YES.

646
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:05,978
REALLY?
WITH WHAT MONEY?

647
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,647
THE MONEY MOM GAVE US
FOR DOING CHORES.

648
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,065
WHERE DO YOU THINK
MOM GETS HER MONEY?

649
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:11,400
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?

650
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,820
WHY DON'T WE
DISCUSS THIS LATER?

651
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:28,250
WHY WEREN'T YOU
WEARING A SHIRT?

652
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:33,087
IT WAS A 110°.

653
00:30:33,138 --> 00:30:35,422
I DIDN'T KNOW
THE SUN WAS SO HOT.

654
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:41,562
THAT FEELS NICE

655
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:44,064
WHEN YOU TOUCH ME
LIKE THAT.

656
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:53,189
WHY'D YOU STOP?

657
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:57,160
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU THE WRONG IDEA.

658
00:30:57,194 --> 00:30:59,195
WHAT IDEA IS THAT?

659
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:01,363
THAT EVERYTHING
IS OKAY WITH US.

660
00:31:02,949 --> 00:31:06,952
YOU PROMISED ME THAT IF WE DID
THIS SHOW YOU'D BE HOME MORE.

661
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,208
YOU KNOW, I WAS FLYING
BACK HERE THINKING

662
00:31:13,242 --> 00:31:16,677
EVEN IF MY BUSINESS
FALLS APART,

663
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:20,731
I ALWAYS GOT YOU,
I ALWAYS GOT THE FAMILY.

664
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:24,819
THEN WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
RUNNING AWAY FROM US?

665
00:31:24,853 --> 00:31:28,973
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.

666
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,941
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

667
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:36,012
IT WOULD BE NICE
IF ONCE IN A WHILE

668
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:39,983
YOU LOOKED AT ME LIKE
I WAS WORTH SOMETHING.

669
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,936
A MAN NEEDS THAT
FROM TIME TO TIME.

670
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:53,295
AND WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU THINK
IT IS A WOMAN NEEDS, BILL?

671
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:57,282
I THINK I UNDERSTAND
WHAT A WOMAN NEEDS.

672
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,619
I THINK WE CAN BOTH
AGREE ON THAT.

673
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,089
OW!

674
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,759
OW OW OW.
STOP IT.

675
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,563
WHAT?

676
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:16,466
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

677
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:18,685
HONEY.

678
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:26,643
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU.

679
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:30,112
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
FOR ME,

680
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:32,815
THE ONLY ONE
THAT EVER MATTERED.

681
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,970
OW.

682
00:32:56,004 --> 00:32:58,004
- OH.
- MY BACK.

683
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:19,041
HI.

684
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:21,577
YES, IS VAL AROUND? I'D LIKE
TO TAKE HER UP ON HER OFFER.

685
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:23,212
HEY, PAT.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

686
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:25,465
MY BOYS ARE GIVING
A CONCERT THIS WEEKEND.

687
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:27,499
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME
TO LOOK GLAMOROUS.

688
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:31,002
HEY, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.
LOOK AT THIS.

689
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:34,539
I'VE GOT THESE ADORABLE LITTLE PASTEL
JUMPERS WITH MATCHING SHOES

690
00:33:34,557 --> 00:33:36,207
AND THERE'S
A TURQUOISE ONE

691
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,343
THAT WOULD LOOK
SUPER KEEN ON YOU.

692
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:42,346
WHAT?
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

693
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,848
THAT'S QUITE
A SUNBURN, VAL.

694
00:33:43,882 --> 00:33:46,317
YEAH, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

695
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:48,486
ONE DAY OF GARDENING.
YOU SHOULD SEE MY BACK.

696
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,021
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY?

697
00:33:51,055 --> 00:33:54,325
THAT LOOKS LIKE MORE THAN
ONE DAY OF GARDENING TO ME.

698
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:56,860
TWO AND A HALF.

699
00:33:56,894 --> 00:33:59,245
I LIED.

700
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,614
TWO AND A HALF.

701
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:03,733
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

702
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:05,869
YOU SHOULD GET A JOB
WITH COPPERTONE.

703
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:10,507
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU WANT TO
TRY IT ON? IT COMES IN FIVE COLORS.

704
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,341
- I'LL TAKE ONE OF EACH.
- OH.

705
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:15,010
AND FORGET THE FREEBIE.
BILL TOLD ME TO USE HIS CREDIT CARD

706
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:17,179
AND BUY WHATEVER I WANT,
NO MATTER WHAT THE PRICE.

707
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:18,747
WELL, THAT'S REALLY--

708
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,549
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D THINK

709
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:23,018
HE WAS FEELING A LITTLE BIT GUILTY,
WOULDN'T YOU?

710
00:34:23,052 --> 00:34:26,587
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT
HE LOVES ME SO.

711
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:30,391
UM, COME TO THINK OF IT,
I'LL NEED SOME SHOES

712
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:33,761
AND, UM, YEAH,
SOME LUGGAGE MAYBE.

713
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:37,532
YEAH, I MIGHT BE TRAVELING
SOON WITH THE CHILDREN.

714
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:40,034
IT'LL BREAK BILL'S HEART
TO BE LEFT HERE ALL ALONE,

715
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:43,102
BUT I TOLD THE GIRLS WE MIGHT
GO TO TAOS THIS SUMMER.

716
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,438
HOW WOULD THAT
WORK FOR YOU?

717
00:34:47,492 --> 00:34:49,626
COULD I SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

718
00:34:58,218 --> 00:35:00,786
WHAT ON EARTH
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

719
00:35:00,804 --> 00:35:04,173
YOU OFFERED TO SHOW ME YOUR
SUNBURNED BACK. DO YOU MIND?

720
00:35:04,224 --> 00:35:06,008
I THINK THOSE CAMERAS
FOLLOWING YOU AROUND

721
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:08,511
HAS MADE YOU
A LITTLE NUTS.

722
00:35:08,562 --> 00:35:10,645
ARE YOU COMING
TO THE CONCERT?

723
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,815
I'M NOT SURE
IF I SHOULD.

724
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:16,935
OH, THE BOYS WOULD BE
HURT IF YOU DIDN'T COME.

725
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:19,521
WE'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF YOU AS FAMILY, VAL.

726
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,496
¶ WE'LL BE FIGHTING
IN THE STREET ¶

727
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:33,217
¶ WITH OUR CHILDREN
AT OUR FEET ¶

728
00:35:33,251 --> 00:35:36,086
¶ AND THE MORALS
THAT THEY WORSHIP ¶

729
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,955
¶ WILL BE GONE ¶

730
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,026
¶ I'LL TIP MY HAT
TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION ¶

731
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:47,396
¶ TAKE A BOW
FOR THE NEW REVOLUTION ¶

732
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:50,850
¶ SMILE AND GRIN
AT THE CHANGE ALL AROUND ¶

733
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:54,502
¶ PICK UP MY GUITAR
AND PLAY ¶

734
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,722
¶ JUST LIKE YESTERDAY ¶

735
00:35:57,757 --> 00:36:02,277
¶ AND I'LL GET
ON MY KNEES AND PRAY ¶

736
00:36:05,064 --> 00:36:07,983
¶ WE DON'T GET FOOLED
AGAIN... ¶

737
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:36,809
PAT LOUD?
THE PAT LOUD?

738
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:39,811
I'M CRAIG GILBERT FROM NEW YORK.
I'M A BIG FAN.

739
00:36:39,846 --> 00:36:42,347
I THOUGHT
FANS WERE LOYAL.

740
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:44,382
IT'S REALLY BEEN
QUITE A WHILE, YOU KNOW?

741
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,518
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I COULDN'T GET AWAY.

742
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:48,520
BUT I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
EVERY DAY IN DAILIES

743
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:50,389
AND YOU ARE AMAZING
IN EVERY FRAME.

744
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:53,407
ARE ALL MEN BULLSHITTERS, CRAIG,
OR JUST THE ONES IN MY LIFE?

745
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:01,866
FOR A GROUP TO ATTAIN
SUPER STARDOM,

746
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,668
THEY HAVE TO BE
ABOUT ONE PERSON.

747
00:37:03,702 --> 00:37:06,403
NOW, THE SUPREMES HAVE IT.
THE EMOTIONS DON'T.

748
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:08,738
SO DO THESE KIDS STAND
A CHANCE AT MAKING IT?

749
00:37:08,756 --> 00:37:11,124
- I'M TOM, BY THE WAY--
PATTY'S BROTHER. - HELLO.

750
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:13,543
SURE, THEY'RE GREAT. THEY
SHOULD DEFINITELY STICK WITH IT.

751
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:16,596
OH, NOW THAT'S EASY FOR
A GUY WITH NO KIDS TO SAY.

752
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:19,599
LIFE'S ALL ABOUT CHASING
YOUR DREAMS, RIGHT?

753
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:23,135
WHY, I EVEN GOT ONE WHO THINKS
I'M GONNA FLY HIM OFF TO PARIS.

754
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:25,437
WELL, ACTUALLY
HE'S IN PARIS.

755
00:37:25,472 --> 00:37:26,689
HE'S WHAT?

756
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:28,774
AND I SENT A CINEMATOGRAPHER
OFF AFTER HIM.

757
00:37:28,808 --> 00:37:30,592
GOOD FOR OLD LANCE.

758
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,929
HE GOT SOMEONE TO PAY FOR
A TRIP OTHER THAN HIS OLD MAN.

759
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:36,231
FINE BY ME.

760
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:38,316
- ALAN.
- WELL, IT'S NOT FINE BY ME.

761
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:40,485
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE
THAT PARIS FOOTAGE.

762
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:43,270
IN FACT, I'D LIKE TO SEE
ALL THE FOOTAGE AND FIND OUT

763
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:45,490
WHAT THE HELL ELSE
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY FAMILY

764
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,609
AND WHAT YOU'RE AIMING FOR
WITH ANY OF THIS.

765
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:50,328
ALL RIGHT.

766
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:52,329
THINK OF A SPACESHIP
LANDING ON EARTH

767
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,865
1,000 YEARS FROM NOW
AND FINDING A TIME CAPSULE.

768
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:57,134
AND INSIDE THAT TIME
CAPSULE IS A FILM.

769
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:59,169
AND ON THE FILM
EVERYONE IS SMILING

770
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,922
AND SAFE IN THE CERTAINTY
OF EACH OTHER'S LOVE.

771
00:38:01,956 --> 00:38:03,890
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT,
ALL THE ALIENS FOUND

772
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:08,227
WAS AN OLD EPISODE OF
"THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY."

773
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:11,313
NOW IS THAT WHAT WE REALLY
WANT TO LEAVE BEHIND AS A CULTURE--

774
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:15,300
SOMETHING THAT'S THE COMPLETE
ANTITHESIS OF HOW WE REALLY LIVE,

775
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:18,521
FUMBLING AROUND
IN CONFUSION?

776
00:38:18,572 --> 00:38:20,739
OH, THAT'S
FULL OF SHIT.

777
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:23,408
FUMBLING AROUND
IN CONFUSION?

778
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:25,476
THE LOUDS
ARE NOT CONFUSED

779
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:27,162
AND WE ARE NOT
FUMBLING AROUND.

780
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:28,646
I AM FINE.

781
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:31,149
MY FAMILY IS FINE.

782
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:32,951
I AM GOING TO COME
TO THE MOTEL

783
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:34,836
TO LOOK AT SOME FOOTAGE
TOMORROW, CRAIG.

784
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,588
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING ABOUT
IT THAT GIVES A FALSE IMPRESSION

785
00:38:37,622 --> 00:38:40,708
THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING
TO MAKE SENSE OF OUR LIVES,

786
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:43,010
IT'S NOT GOING
ON THE AIR.

787
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:58,057
Who did that?

788
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,913
Our sons
are criminals.

789
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:06,398
I have to wash my hair
again tonight.

790
00:39:09,452 --> 00:39:11,903
THERE'S 86,000'
OF FILM THERE, PAT,

791
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:13,488
EVERY FRAME
AS GOOD AS THAT.

792
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:15,657
NOW WE COULD
SIT HERE FOR DAYS

793
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:18,026
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO--

794
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:20,527
NO, THAT WON'T BE
NECESSARY.

795
00:39:20,545 --> 00:39:23,363
I'LL SEND A PROJECTOR OVER
WHEN THE PARIS FOOTAGE COMES IN.

796
00:39:27,202 --> 00:39:30,171
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR LAST NIGHT.

797
00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:32,423
I'VE BEEN HAVING
KIND OF A TOUGH TIME.

798
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:34,707
WELL, THAT'S CLEAR TO SEE.

799
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:42,816
ARE YOU AND BILL
HAVING PROBLEMS?

800
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,485
THE PAINFUL TRUTH IS

801
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,772
THAT YES, WE HAVE HAD
A ROCKY PAST AND...

802
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:53,058
NOW I'M NOT SURE
WHERE WE ARE.

803
00:39:55,328 --> 00:39:57,896
WELL, I CAN'T
SPEAK FOR BILL,

804
00:39:57,914 --> 00:39:59,915
BUT THE PAT LOUD
THAT I SEE IS A VISION

805
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:02,334
OF A LIBERATED MODERN WOMAN.

806
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:04,836
PANTSUITS WILL DO THAT.

807
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,293
IN FACT,
I SEE A ROLE MODEL.

808
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:14,512
WOMEN ALL ACROSS AMERICA
ARE GOING TO LOOK TO YOU

809
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:18,915
FOR A ROADMAP OF HOW TO BE
AND WHO TO BE.

810
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:21,351
YOU'RE IN THE POSITION
TO SHOW WOMEN,

811
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,419
WHOSE STRENGTH
IS ERODING,

812
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:26,022
HOW TO TAKE BACK
THEIR LIVES.

813
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,279
AS USUAL,
YOU ARE VERY ELOQUENT.

814
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:34,647
WELL, LAST NIGHT YOU ASKED ME
IF I WAS A BULLSHITTER.

815
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,816
ARE YOU?

816
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:40,286
TEST ME.

817
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:45,708
WHEN WE FIRST MET I TOLD YOU
WHAT I THOUGHT OF YOU.

818
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:48,276
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF ME?

819
00:40:49,995 --> 00:40:53,381
I THOUGHT,

820
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:57,752
"IF THAT GUY CAN FIX
HIS FLABBY BODY,

821
00:40:57,786 --> 00:41:00,338
I'VE MET
MY PERFECT MAN."

822
00:41:06,227 --> 00:41:08,929
I ALWAYS FANTASIZED THAT IF
I COULD FIND THE RIGHT MAN,

823
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:10,731
I'D LEAVE HIM.

824
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:12,816
BECAUSE I CANNOT
LIVE ALONE.

825
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:16,736
I ABSOLUTELY
CAN'T DO IT.

826
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,738
I'M GOING THROUGH THIS
STAGE IN MY LIFE NOW

827
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:20,523
WHERE LANCE HAS LEFT.

828
00:41:20,574 --> 00:41:23,075
SOON THE REST OF MY KIDS
WILL FOLLOW.

829
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,194
AND WHAT
HAVE I GOT LEFT?

830
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:28,231
I HAVEN'T GOT
ANYTHING LEFT.

831
00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:30,900
IT SCARES ME
TO DEATH.

832
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:43,494
- HEY. - DON'T TALK.
JUST LISTEN.

833
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:45,496
I PROMISED THE GIRLS
A TRIP TO TAOS.

834
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:47,882
WE'LL GO AS SOON
AS SCHOOL'S OUT.

835
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:49,767
I WANT DELILAH TO HAVE
A BREAK FROM BRAD.

836
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,886
SHE CAN TAKE
A FRIEND INSTEAD.

837
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:54,104
I'LL FIND A HORSE
FOR MICHELE TO RIDE.

838
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:56,774
GRANT'S WILLING TO GIVE IT
A TRY IN ORANGE COUNTY

839
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:59,193
SHOVELING CEMENT.

840
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:02,562
AND KEVIN WILL ACCOMPANY
TODD MAN TO AUSTRALIA.

841
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:04,981
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
SOMEBODY LISTENED TO ME.

842
00:42:05,015 --> 00:42:06,816
NOBODY'S LISTENING TO YOU.

843
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,953
I JUST WANT EVERYONE
ACCOUNTED FOR BEFORE I GO,

844
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:12,188
SO NO ONE'S IN DANGER
OF DESERTION.

845
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:16,074
SO NOW GOING TO WORK
IS DESERTION TO YOU?

846
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,996
I'M GOING AWAY
TO GET SOME CLARITY

847
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,698
ABOUT WHAT IS REAL
AND WHAT ISN'T.

848
00:42:23,716 --> 00:42:27,869
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO GET AWAY, PAT.

849
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:31,172
I'M SURE YOU DO.

850
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,210
YOU THINK THAT'S GOING
TO RIDE ALL RIGHT, HUH?

851
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:45,318
- BYE-BYE, LITTLE DARLING.
- BYE, DAD.  I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

852
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:47,437
I LEFT THE NUMBER OF
THE HOUSE WE'RE STAYING AT.

853
00:42:47,488 --> 00:42:50,390
I EXPECT YOU TO CALL ME COLLECT
AS SOON AS YOU GET TO AUSTRALIA.

854
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:52,558
- ALL RIGHT?
- I WILL.

855
00:42:53,894 --> 00:42:57,998
- BYE. - WHEN DO YOU
COME TO TAOS?

856
00:42:58,032 --> 00:43:00,332
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
YOU CAN ANSWER ME.

857
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:03,568
- WE'LL FLY UP OVER THE WEEKEND.
- NEAT.

858
00:43:03,586 --> 00:43:05,287
WHO AM I GONNA TAKE
TO THE FIESTA DAY PARADE?

859
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:07,172
OH WELL, I MIGHT BE
BACK BY THEN, SO...

860
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:08,791
THE HECK YOU WILL.

861
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:11,293
MOM, YOU SAID THAT IF I REALLY
MISSED BRAD THAT I COULD COME BACK.

862
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:13,595
I MADE LUNCH FOR
ALL YOU GUYS BY THE POOL.

863
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,596
- BYE, GRANT.
- BYE.

864
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:17,915
- BYE, KEVIN.
- DELILAH.

865
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:20,051
- BYE, DELILAH.
- BYE, BRAD.

866
00:43:20,085 --> 00:43:21,719
BYE, BRAD.

867
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:24,088
OH, I LOVE YOU, BRAD.

868
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:32,279
NO, RAY DAVIES.
I'M TELLING YOU.

869
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:34,982
- RAY DAVIES.
- RAY DAVIES?

870
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:36,733
I DON'T LIKE HIM AS MUCH.

871
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,570
- "CHANGES" IS GOOD.
- "LIFE ON MARS."

872
00:43:40,604 --> 00:43:43,322
"LIFE ON MARS" IS GOOD.

873
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,574
ALAN, SUSAN,

874
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:48,327
I'M HEADING DOWN TO MY
OFFICE IN ABOUT AN HOUR

875
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,129
AND IF YOU WANT
TO COME ALONG,

876
00:43:50,163 --> 00:43:53,949
I'VE GOT SOME PRETTY INTERESTING
STUFF COMING DOWN THE PIKE TODAY.

877
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:56,618
THEY'RE FILMING ME BUYING
A NEW BUSINESS SUIT, DAD.

878
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,303
YEAH, AND THEN
BAND PRACTICE.

879
00:43:58,337 --> 00:44:01,556
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.

880
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,508
MAYBE TOMORROW, BILL.

881
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:13,751
HELLO.

882
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:17,137
- CRAIG, IT'S BILL.
- Bill... hi.

883
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,073
DID THEY
GET OFF OKAY?

884
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:20,807
They did, a few hours ago.

885
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:24,028
LISTEN, HOW LONG
ARE YOU AROUND FOR?

886
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,662
I'M OUT ON A RED-EYE.
WHY?

887
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,864
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
COULD DO ME A FAVOR TODAY.

888
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,816
WELL, IF IT'S
IN MY POWER, SURE.

889
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,786
WELL, CRAIG,
I HAVE A FRIEND

890
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,039
who would like to get
into show business.

891
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,091
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

892
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:40,009
JUST GIVE HER SOME ADVICE.

893
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,544
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU CAN
DO SOMETHING, THAT'D BE GREAT.

894
00:44:42,595 --> 00:44:44,162
PERSONALLY I THINK
SHE'S A KNOCKOUT.

895
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,965
IT'S CLEAR TO YOU I'M NOT
THAT KIND OF PRODUCER, RIGHT?

896
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:50,352
- BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE
TO KNOW THAT. - YEAH.

897
00:44:50,386 --> 00:44:52,504
AND PATTY DOESN'T HAVE
TO KNOW ABOUT THIS EITHER.

898
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:54,506
I HAVEN'T BEEN
AN ANGEL, CRAIG,

899
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:56,673
BUT I'M SURE YOU'VE
FIGURED THAT OUT,

900
00:44:56,691 --> 00:45:00,895
CONSIDERING ALL THE TIME YOU
TWO HAVE BEEN SPENDING TOGETHER.

901
00:45:03,398 --> 00:45:06,984
ANYWAY, I LEARNED THE HARD
WAY TO BE VERY CAREFUL,

902
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:09,987
KEEP ANY SOUVENIRS THAT MIGHT
GET HER STARTED OUT OF SIGHT.

903
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:12,355
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"SOUVENIRS"?

904
00:45:12,373 --> 00:45:14,707
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MATCHBOOKS,

905
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:17,494
SWIZZLE STICKS,
PHOTOS--

906
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:18,995
STUFF TO LOOK BACK ON

907
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:21,047
AND SEE THAT THERE WAS
MORE TO THAT BILL LOUD GUY

908
00:45:21,082 --> 00:45:23,049
THAN JUST SOME PACK MULE
SLAVING AWAY

909
00:45:23,084 --> 00:45:25,535
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE'S SHOT
AT SELF-FULFILLMENT.

910
00:45:25,553 --> 00:45:29,371
WELL, LIKE I'VE SAID,
EVERY HUSBAND DESERVES A HIDING PLACE.

911
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:32,057
THEY'VE GOT IT FIGURED
OUT RIGHT IN EUROPE--

912
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:34,359
A MAN'S A MAN
AND FAMILY'S SACRED.

913
00:45:34,394 --> 00:45:36,512
BUT A MAN
IN YOUR SITUATION,

914
00:45:36,546 --> 00:45:38,514
YOUR MARRIAGE BEING
WHAT IT IS,

915
00:45:38,548 --> 00:45:41,682
YOU PROBABLY UNDERSTAND
THAT MORE THAN ANYBODY.

916
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:47,355
I KNOW I'M SHAPING UP TO BE
THE SQUARE OF YOUR SHOW.

917
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:50,441
MAYBE I'VE GOT MORE
GOING ON THAN YOU THINK.

918
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,535
SALLY IS LIKE
A SISTER TO ME.

919
00:46:03,171 --> 00:46:05,405
- YEAH.
- A BAD SISTER.

920
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:12,011
SO DOESN'T SHE PHOTOGRAPH
GREAT, CRAIG?

921
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:15,364
- DON'T YOU THINK?
- OH, BILLY, THAT ONE?

922
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,349
- VERY LOVELY.
- THANKS.

923
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:19,135
YOU KNOW WHAT I TELL HER
THE PROBLEM IS?

924
00:46:19,186 --> 00:46:21,253
TOO MUCH LIKE
BRIGITTE BARDOT.

925
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:24,256
YES.
YES, I SEE THAT.

926
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:27,058
DO YOUR THING,
YOU KNOW, THE--

927
00:46:27,092 --> 00:46:28,943
- OH BILLY.
- GO AHEAD.

928
00:46:28,978 --> 00:46:31,095
OKAY.

929
00:46:33,649 --> 00:46:36,484
"AND I, OF LADIES

930
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:38,820
MOST DEJECT
AND WRETCHED,

931
00:46:38,871 --> 00:46:42,439
THAT SUCKED THE HONEY
OF HIS MUSIC VOWS,

932
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:45,659
NOW SEE THAT NOBLE
AND MOST SOVEREIGN REASON

933
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:48,795
LIKE SWEET BELLS JANGLED

934
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,632
OUT OF TUNE AND HARSH,
THAT--"

935
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:54,250
YEAH.

936
00:46:54,284 --> 00:46:56,552
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS,
BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT.

937
00:46:56,587 --> 00:46:58,821
IT'S OPHELIA.

938
00:46:58,856 --> 00:47:00,139
- VERY NICE.
- THANK YOU.

939
00:47:00,174 --> 00:47:02,642
- SHAKESPEARE.
- AH.

940
00:47:02,676 --> 00:47:04,644
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK, CRAIG?

941
00:47:04,678 --> 00:47:08,264
I THINK I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE THAT
WOULD BE QUITE INTERESTED IN THESE.

942
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:22,994
¶ SHE'S BOUGHT A HAT
LIKE PRINCESS MARINA'S ¶

943
00:47:23,029 --> 00:47:27,481
¶ AND HER NEIGHBORS THINK
IT SUITS HER A TREAT ¶

944
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:30,651
¶ BUT SHE HASN'T
ANY FOOD ¶

945
00:47:30,669 --> 00:47:32,820
¶ IN THE WHOLE LARDER ¶

946
00:47:32,854 --> 00:47:35,506
¶ NOR HAS ANYBODY ELSE ¶

947
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,008
¶ IN THE STREET ¶

948
00:47:38,042 --> 00:47:40,493
¶ BUT SHE SMILES
AND YOU'D THINK ¶

949
00:47:40,511 --> 00:47:42,962
¶ SHE WAS WEALTHY ¶

950
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:47,166
¶ SHE SMILES JUST LIKE
A REAL MILLIONAIRE... ¶

951
00:47:47,184 --> 00:47:50,336
- OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T KNOW THERE'S
A CAMERA THERE. - MY BROTHER'S SO SHY.

952
00:47:50,354 --> 00:47:53,555
¶ ...PRINCESS MARINA ¶

953
00:47:53,606 --> 00:47:57,809
- ¶ 'CAUSE SHE DON'T CARE. ¶
- Pat: OH YEAH.

954
00:47:57,843 --> 00:48:00,312
LET'S HEAR IT
FOR LANCE LOUD.

955
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:03,615
- GO LANCE!
- I LIKED IT.

956
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,817
MOM.

957
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:07,851
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
ABOUT TO START WHINING.

958
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:09,820
WELL, YOU SAID THAT
WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT.

959
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:11,906
AFTER JUST 10 DAYS,
DELILAH?

960
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:13,741
MOM, 10 DAYS IN TAOS
IS AN ETERNITY.

961
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:16,994
MISS LOUD, MY MOM SAID I CAN TAKE
THE BUS BACK IF DELILAH COMES WITH.

962
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:19,196
- HELLO?
- WHO IS IT, SWEETIE?

963
00:48:19,214 --> 00:48:21,499
HI.
MR. GILBERT.

964
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:24,718
DAD SAID THAT WE COULD COME BACK
WHENEVER WE WANTED, JUST CALL ANYTIME.

965
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:26,836
HE SAID HE'D HAVE DINNER
ON THE TABLE.  MOM.

966
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,805
FINE.
TAKE THE BUS TOMORROW.

967
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,090
YES!

968
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:32,809
AT LAST,
A GROWNUP TO TALK TO.

969
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,312
- HOW'S YOUR TRIP?
- Fine.

970
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:38,013
I was kind of hoping that you
might turn up here tomorrow.

971
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:41,717
- Why? - FEELING A LITTLE SULTRY,
I GUESS.

972
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:43,819
Listen, this is...

973
00:48:43,853 --> 00:48:47,222
VERY HARD FOR ME
TO DISCUSS.

974
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,442
I'VE BEEN DEBATING
WHETHER TO CALL OR NOT.

975
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:54,061
But as a friend,
I felt that I should.

976
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,731
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

977
00:48:56,749 --> 00:48:59,284
I saw Bill
before I left

978
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:02,637
AND HE TOOK ME
FOR A RIDE TO MALIBU

979
00:49:02,671 --> 00:49:04,372
to see a friend.

980
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:06,623
WHO?
ANDY PLATT?

981
00:49:06,674 --> 00:49:08,625
NO NO, NOT ANDY PLATT.

982
00:49:08,676 --> 00:49:11,378
HER NAME WAS SALLY.

983
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:14,298
And she gave me
an 8x10 glossy

984
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:17,301
AND A TAPE OF HER SINGING
"THE SOUND OF MUSIC."

985
00:49:21,004 --> 00:49:23,939
LOOK, I CAN FLY OUT
TO SANTA BARBARA TOMORROW

986
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:25,891
AND YOU CAN
MEET ME THERE

987
00:49:25,925 --> 00:49:27,593
and we'll talk
things through.

988
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:29,478
I understand
what you're feeling.

989
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:34,650
I'M STILL RAW
FROM MY OWN SITUATION.

990
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:39,154
- Patty.
- WE'RE FILMING TOMORROW.

991
00:49:39,205 --> 00:49:41,323
WELL, I'M THE PRODUCER.
I CAN CHANGE THE SCHEDULE.

992
00:49:41,374 --> 00:49:42,824
No.

993
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:45,160
IF SINGING SALLY
EVER SEES ME ON TV,

994
00:49:45,211 --> 00:49:48,296
I WANT HER TO SEE ME HERE
IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

995
00:49:58,823 --> 00:50:01,058
HONESTLY, IF I HEAR
ANOTHER ACCORDION,

996
00:50:01,076 --> 00:50:03,344
I'M GOING TO VOMIT ALL
OVER THIS TABLE. I REALLY AM.

997
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,279
I'M SERIOUS, CAN'T YOU ASK
YOUR FATHER FOR MORE MONEY?

998
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,064
I'M GETTING BORED HERE.

999
00:50:08,082 --> 00:50:10,066
BORED IN PARIS-- WHO KNEW
THAT WAS POSSIBLE?

1000
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:12,418
I ACTUALLY MISS
SANTA BARBARA.

1001
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:18,140
In Santa Barbara, firefighters
continue to battle a wildfire

1002
00:50:18,158 --> 00:50:20,409
that started in the ridges
above Mountain Drive.

1003
00:50:20,443 --> 00:50:22,644
One home has been lost
and many more are threatened.

1004
00:50:22,662 --> 00:50:25,497
Police and firemen
are evacuating residents...

1005
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:32,087
OH, MOM, IT'S BURNING
AROUND HERE.

1006
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:33,955
I'm here alone.
I don't know what to do.

1007
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,456
PUT YOUR FATHER
ON THE PHONE.

1008
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,375
NO, HE'S NOT HERE EITHER.
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

1009
00:50:37,426 --> 00:50:39,093
- WHAT?
- He called to say

1010
00:50:39,127 --> 00:50:41,095
THAT HE WAS AWAY ON BUSINESS,
BUT HE WOULDN'T SAY WHERE.

1011
00:50:41,129 --> 00:50:43,848
SON OF A BITCH. LISTEN,
GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

1012
00:50:43,882 --> 00:50:46,100
- THE POLICE ARE HERE.
- I'm still 10 hours away.

1013
00:50:46,134 --> 00:50:48,219
OH, MOM, I THINK
THE COPS ARE HERE FOR US.

1014
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,720
GO GO.
FOR GOD'S SAKE, GO.

1015
00:51:07,036 --> 00:51:08,720
MOM!

1016
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,908
GRANT.

1017
00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:14,910
- OH BABIES.
- MOM.

1018
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:16,712
- DELILAH. - MOM, THE ENTIRE
HILL WAS BURNING.

1019
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:19,080
I WAS SO WORRIED.

1020
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:20,832
- WE'RE OKAY.
- IT'S OKAY, MOM.

1021
00:51:20,866 --> 00:51:22,383
I'M FINE.
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.

1022
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:25,720
- OH MY GOD.
- MOM, LANCE IS COMING HOME.

1023
00:51:25,754 --> 00:51:27,204
WHAT?

1024
00:51:27,222 --> 00:51:29,674
MY BABIES
ARE COMING HOME.

1025
00:51:38,316 --> 00:51:40,717
A TRUE UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING OBJECT.

1026
00:51:40,735 --> 00:51:43,219
OH MY GOSH.

1027
00:51:43,237 --> 00:51:46,106
WHO IS THIS?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1028
00:51:48,158 --> 00:51:51,243
HI!  YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

1029
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,162
- I FOUND THIS IN FRANCE.
- OH MY GOD.

1030
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:55,080
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE IT.
YOU CAN THROW IT ON.

1031
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:57,166
YOU CAN WEAR IT
FOR A CONCERT,

1032
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,035
JUST TO REALLY SPARK UP
SANTA BARBARA AND ALL THAT.

1033
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:02,071
HEY, DAD'S HOME.

1034
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:06,541
WELL, IT'S
THE LONE RANGER.

1035
00:52:06,575 --> 00:52:08,927
- HI, DAD.
- MY WORLD TRAVELER.

1036
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:10,845
HI.

1037
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,430
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
YOU LOOK GOOD.

1038
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:14,382
OH WAIT, LOOK.
I GOT YOU A PRESENT.

1039
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:17,434
OH, THANK YOU, LANCE.

1040
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:19,436
THAT'S A SHARP-LOOKING
TIE THERE, LANCE.

1041
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:21,555
- YOU LIKE IT?
- IT SURE IS.  YEAH.

1042
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:23,757
- IT HAS LOTS OF COLORS.
- THANK YOU.

1043
00:52:23,775 --> 00:52:25,726
THAT'S FOR YOU.

1044
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,478
OOH, WHAT'S THIS,
KEMOSABE?

1045
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:29,947
$300,000 WORTH
OF SHOVEL TEETH.

1046
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,315
THAT'S MORE THAN WORTH
THE WEEKEND

1047
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:34,984
IN THE HELL HOLE OF FRESNO,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

1048
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:37,954
WELL, I'M SURE
IT WAS HELL, BILL.

1049
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,373
SAY, ISN'T THIS
FIESTA DAY?

1050
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,908
WHO WANTS TO GO
TO THE PARADE?

1051
00:52:41,942 --> 00:52:43,059
PATTY?

1052
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,628
WELL, I'M SHOPPING
FOR HELEN HARRISON.

1053
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,612
YOU KNOW, HER HOUSE
BURNED DOWN.

1054
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,831
OH YEAH, I HEARD
ABOUT THE FIRE.

1055
00:52:49,882 --> 00:52:51,449
YEAH, I ALMOST DIED.

1056
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:53,835
YOU ALMOST DIED?
WOW.

1057
00:52:53,886 --> 00:52:55,887
WELL, THAT'S AWFUL,
BIG D.

1058
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,490
WHEN I GOT HERE ON WEDNESDAY,
THE WHOLE PATIO WAS COVERED IN ASH.

1059
00:52:58,524 --> 00:53:00,559
IS THAT WHY
THAT POOL'S SO GREEN?

1060
00:53:00,593 --> 00:53:02,510
NO, THAT'S ALGAE.

1061
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:05,479
THE POOL MAN LEFT A NOTE.
HE COULDN'T GET IN.

1062
00:53:05,514 --> 00:53:07,648
APPARENTLY YOU LOCKED
THE PATIO

1063
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:11,134
WHEN YOU WENT TO,
UM, FRESNO.

1064
00:53:11,152 --> 00:53:13,821
BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS,
THAT WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO.

1065
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,322
WELL, I MADE IT BACK
FOR FIESTA.

1066
00:53:16,357 --> 00:53:18,157
HOW ABOUT I FLIP
SOME BURGERS

1067
00:53:18,192 --> 00:53:20,142
FOR THE COMMUNITY BUFFET
AT EL PASEO TONIGHT?

1068
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,530
WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT, BILL? WHY DON'T
YOU FLIP SOME BURGERS FOR THE BUFFET?

1069
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:26,449
I'M SURE THE CREW WOULD LOVE
TO GET A NICE SHOT OF THAT.

1070
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:28,952
YOU KNOW WHAT THE SAD
TRUTH IS?

1071
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:30,669
THE KIDS ADORE
THEIR DADDY.

1072
00:53:30,703 --> 00:53:32,504
EVEN LANCE,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

1073
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:34,039
BUT SOMEWHERE
ALONG THE LINE

1074
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:36,041
HE LOST THE LINK
TO ANYTHING THAT'S REAL--

1075
00:53:36,092 --> 00:53:39,878
TO ME, TO THEM,
TO HIS HOME.

1076
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:42,798
AND I'VE FINALLY GIVEN UP
ON PULLING HIM BACK.

1077
00:53:46,552 --> 00:53:48,436
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

1078
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:53,808
WOW, THE MENU
HASN'T CHANGED.

1079
00:53:53,842 --> 00:53:57,061
OH, YOU'VE BEEN
HERE BEFORE.

1080
00:53:57,112 --> 00:54:00,146
I ACTUALLY--

1081
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,399
I PICKED UP A MAN
IN THAT BAR ONCE.

1082
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,203
REALLY?

1083
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,358
WELL, I'M ASTONISHED.

1084
00:54:12,376 --> 00:54:13,877
WHAT, THAT I COULD
DO SUCH A THING?

1085
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:16,378
NO, THAT YOU WOULD
TELL ME.

1086
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:19,748
BACK WHEN I CAUGHT BILL
RUNNING AROUND,

1087
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:23,702
HE KEPT GOING ON AND ON
ABOUT AN OPEN MARRIAGE.

1088
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,305
I GUESS I WAS
ALREADY IN ONE,

1089
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:28,724
JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT.

1090
00:54:28,758 --> 00:54:30,758
ANYWAY, HE ACTUALLY
ENCOURAGED ME

1091
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,044
TO PARTICIPATE.

1092
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,712
I GAVE IT A TRY.

1093
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,065
IT WASN'T FOR ME.

1094
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:38,850
AND THEN I--

1095
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:40,818
I GAVE HIM
AN ULTIMATUM.

1096
00:54:40,853 --> 00:54:45,439
I THINK THAT MEN HANDLE
AGING DIFFERENTLY THAN WOMEN.

1097
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,024
ALAN, ALAN, ALAN,
ALAN, ALAN.

1098
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:49,059
READY?
HERE WE GO.

1099
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,613
- WOW.
- NO NO, WAIT.

1100
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,698
CUT.  ROLL AGAIN.
HERE WE GO.

1101
00:54:54,732 --> 00:54:57,501
READY?  ALAN, READY?
ALAN, READY?

1102
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:02,237
LANCE, ARE YOU
SEEING THIS?

1103
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:04,123
WHERE'S PATTY?
SHE LOVES THIS.

1104
00:55:07,177 --> 00:55:09,512
AH, THERE SHE IS.

1105
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:13,632
SHE CERTAINLY ISN'T
WINNING ANY POINTS

1106
00:55:13,683 --> 00:55:16,918
FOR ELEGANCE NOW,
IS SHE?

1107
00:55:16,936 --> 00:55:19,854
YOU'D THINK I'D BE HAPPY
SHE'S NO BEAUTY QUEEN.

1108
00:55:23,643 --> 00:55:26,645
SOMEHOW IT JUST MAKES
IT ALL A LITTLE WORSE.

1109
00:55:29,364 --> 00:55:33,000
DID I DO THE WRONG THING
SHOWING IT TO YOU?

1110
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:35,703
NO, I--

1111
00:55:35,737 --> 00:55:38,322
I'VE BUILT AN ENTIRE LIFE
LOOKING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

1112
00:55:38,373 --> 00:55:40,841
I THINK IT'S TIME
I LOOKED THEM IN THE EYE.

1113
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,909
WELL, THERE'S MORE
TO TELL

1114
00:55:42,943 --> 00:55:44,577
IF YOU'RE READY
TO HEAR IT.

1115
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:47,997
I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR
THAT TAPE OF HER SINGING.

1116
00:55:48,048 --> 00:55:50,750
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

1117
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:53,469
I COULD REALLY
USE A LAUGH.

1118
00:55:54,888 --> 00:55:57,005
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

1119
00:55:57,056 --> 00:55:59,841
IT'S UP IN MY ROOM.
I'LL GO GET IT.

1120
00:55:59,892 --> 00:56:01,977
WAIT, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

1121
00:56:03,129 --> 00:56:07,265
- REALLY?
- WELL, WHY NOT?

1122
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:10,235
I'M USED TO RAISING
EYEBROWS IN THIS PLACE.

1123
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,771
ALL RIGHT.

1124
00:56:16,074 --> 00:56:19,309
DID YOU READ THAT LAST ONE? YOU
DIDN'T READ THAT LAST ONE, DID YOU?

1125
00:56:19,327 --> 00:56:21,495
KAY, I INSIST
YOU SIT RIGHT HERE.

1126
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:25,533
VIVA LA FIESTA,
PATRICIA.

1127
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,499
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE
TO SAY IT, KAY,

1128
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:47,636
BUT I ENVIED YOUR HUSBAND
FROM THE MOMENT WE MET.

1129
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,605
AND I PITIED
YOUR WIFE.

1130
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,940
OH, SHE'S ALWAYS
MAD AT ME, KAY.

1131
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,859
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

1132
00:56:53,893 --> 00:56:56,861
I'M AT A DANGEROUS AGE.

1133
00:56:56,895 --> 00:56:58,730
14 IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT.

1134
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:00,998
- ARE YOU GETTING THIS?
- UNBELIEVABLE.

1135
00:57:01,033 --> 00:57:03,151
TELL JERRY I HOPE
HE FEELS BETTER.

1136
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:05,403
PAN RIGHT AND PREPARE
TO SHIT YOUR PANTS.

1137
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:07,455
WHAT THE HELL DOES
HE THINK HE'S DOING?

1138
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:09,157
- SOMETHING TO EAT?
- SOME STEAKS.

1139
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:10,323
- RARE?
- THANK YOU.

1140
00:57:10,357 --> 00:57:12,876
KEEP IT COMING.
THANK YOU, SENOR.

1141
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:18,999
HEY, DARLING, I SAVED
THIS SPACE JUST FOR YOU.

1142
00:57:21,636 --> 00:57:23,553
HERE, USE THIS.

1143
00:57:23,588 --> 00:57:26,255
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

1144
00:57:26,306 --> 00:57:30,342
- HER PHONE NUMBER.
- THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

1145
00:57:30,376 --> 00:57:32,812
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE--
CECIL B. DeMILLE.

1146
00:57:32,846 --> 00:57:35,564
WELCOME TO FIESTA,
MR. DeMILLE.

1147
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,549
- VIVA LA FIESTA, BILL.
- VIVA LA FIESTA.

1148
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:39,568
CRAIG, YOU CAN'T BE
IN THE SHOT.

1149
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:41,653
JUST FRAME ME OUT.

1150
00:57:41,687 --> 00:57:44,239
PATTY AND I HAD A LONG TALK
AND SHE WANTS ME HERE.

1151
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:46,658
- WHAT FOR?
- MORAL SUPPORT.

1152
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:48,693
PUT THAT THING ON YOUR
SHOULDER AND SHOOT.

1153
00:57:48,727 --> 00:57:51,696
- WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?
- GETTING A DRINK.

1154
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,898
GETTING A DRINK?

1155
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:57,234
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M PRETTY DAMN HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

1156
00:57:57,252 --> 00:58:01,755
JUST A BARREL OF LAUGHS,
HUH, PATTY?

1157
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,509
- BECAUSE LIFE WITH YOU
IS A SAD COMEDY. - WHAT?

1158
00:58:07,578 --> 00:58:10,596
I'M JUST SORRY THAT EVERYBODY
REALLY HAS TO GO THROUGH

1159
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:15,751
THIS RIDICULOUS,
CLOWN-LIKE CIRCUS.

1160
00:58:15,769 --> 00:58:17,419
YOU KNOW,
I ACTUALLY REMEMBER

1161
00:58:17,437 --> 00:58:19,222
WHEN YOU WERE FUN,
PATRICIA--

1162
00:58:19,256 --> 00:58:21,057
THE FIRST
ON THE DANCE FLOOR

1163
00:58:21,091 --> 00:58:23,142
AND THE LAST
TO LEAVE THE PARTY.

1164
00:58:23,193 --> 00:58:25,777
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE CONFUSING
ME WITH SOMEBODY ELSE, BILL.

1165
00:58:25,812 --> 00:58:28,096
NO, THAT WAS YOU
UNTIL YOU TURNED INTO THIS.

1166
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:30,365
WHAT DID I
TURN INTO, BILL?

1167
00:58:30,399 --> 00:58:32,818
SOMEONE THAT LIVES
TO PUT ME DOWN,

1168
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:34,936
BRING ME DOWN.

1169
00:58:34,954 --> 00:58:36,938
AH, WELL,

1170
00:58:36,956 --> 00:58:39,773
I DON'T SEEM TO BE DOING
VERY WELL AT THAT.

1171
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:42,877
YOU'RE DOING
JUST FINE TODAY,

1172
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:45,412
THAT'S FOR SURE.

1173
00:58:45,446 --> 00:58:48,916
IN FACT, I THINK I'M GONNA
SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1174
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,885
WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT?

1175
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:52,753
I THINK SHE'S
OVER THERE SOMEWHERE.

1176
00:58:52,787 --> 00:58:56,389
SAVE YOU FROM HAVING TO SNOOP
AROUND MY CLOSET AND OPEN MY DRAWERS.

1177
00:58:56,423 --> 00:58:58,641
SEND ME TO THE ELECTRIC
CHAIR FOR TRYING TO HAVE

1178
00:58:58,676 --> 00:59:00,760
A LITTLE FUN
LIKE I'M HAVING TODAY

1179
00:59:00,794 --> 00:59:02,262
BECAUSE I'M MARRIED
TO A DOWNER.

1180
00:59:02,296 --> 00:59:04,130
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT, PATTY?

1181
00:59:04,148 --> 00:59:06,266
I THINK YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.

1182
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,234
I THINK YOU ARE
A PATHETIC FOOL,

1183
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:11,186
SAD, LUDICROUS,

1184
00:59:11,237 --> 00:59:14,156
- IDIOTIC, INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
- WHAT ELSE?

1185
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,491
SCHIZOPHRENIC,
SADOMASOCHISTIC--

1186
00:59:16,526 --> 00:59:18,476
GIVE ME THAT PEN.

1187
00:59:18,494 --> 00:59:20,112
I WANT TO WRITE
THIS DOWN, PATTY.

1188
00:59:20,146 --> 00:59:22,363
THIS IS
IMPORTANT STUFF.

1189
00:59:22,414 --> 00:59:24,782
WELL, DON'T LEAVE OUT
GODDAMN ASSHOLE!

1190
00:59:24,816 --> 00:59:26,817
THAT'S IT.  WE'RE DONE.
WE'RE LEAVING.

1191
00:59:26,835 --> 00:59:29,987
VERY GOOD. WHAT WAS THAT?
SCHIZOPHRENIC?

1192
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:32,056
DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO SPELL THAT, PAT?

1193
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:35,042
ALAN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

1194
00:59:35,077 --> 00:59:36,928
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS,
CRAIG.

1195
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:38,661
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
GET THE SECOND CAMERA.

1196
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:40,513
WE'RE OUT OF FILM.

1197
00:59:40,548 --> 00:59:43,166
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

1198
00:59:43,184 --> 00:59:44,801
- GET BACK IN THERE.
- WHOA WHOA.

1199
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:46,303
THIS IS WHAT
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

1200
00:59:46,337 --> 00:59:48,305
THE BEST STUFF
IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

1201
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:51,308
SUSAN AND I HAVE ESTABLISHED
A TRUST WITH THIS FAMILY, CRAIG.

1202
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:54,310
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? WE ACTUALLY
CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM.

1203
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:56,478
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM
DESTROYED BY YOUR FILM.

1204
00:59:56,512 --> 00:59:57,897
THEY'RE DESTROYING
THEMSELVES.

1205
00:59:57,948 --> 01:00:00,149
THEY'VE BEEN DESTROYING
THEMSELVES LONG BEFORE WE GOT HERE

1206
01:00:00,183 --> 01:00:01,617
AND THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT SHY ABOUT IT.

1207
01:00:01,651 --> 01:00:03,185
THEY FORGOT WE WERE
EVEN THERE, MAN!

1208
01:00:03,203 --> 01:00:05,371
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT, ISN'T IT?
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

1209
01:00:05,405 --> 01:00:08,356
WE'RE FINALLY SUCCESSFUL
AND YOU'RE FUCKING IT ALL UP.

1210
01:00:08,374 --> 01:00:10,458
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM?

1211
01:00:10,492 --> 01:00:13,127
I DO.  I CARE
ABOUT ALL OF THEM.

1212
01:00:13,162 --> 01:00:15,029
BUT THERE'S A MUCH
BIGGER PICTURE HERE

1213
01:00:15,047 --> 01:00:16,965
THAT YOU DON'T
EVEN UNDERSTAND.

1214
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:19,667
ONLY TO YOU, CRAIG.

1215
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:21,835
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK, ALAN?

1216
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:24,421
I THINK YOU SAW SOMETHING
IN THERE THAT TERRIFIED YOU.

1217
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:26,873
AND IF I WERE YOU, SUSAN,
I'D BE VERY WORRIED.

1218
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,175
- THAT'S IT!
- WHOA WHOA WHOA.

1219
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:29,676
- ALAN!  GUYS!
- SON OF A BITCH!

1220
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,144
- ALAN, COME ON.
- ARE YOU OKAY?

1221
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:33,363
CONGRATULATIONS, TOMMY.
YOU JUST GOT YOUR BOSS'S JOB.

1222
01:00:33,398 --> 01:00:35,432
PICK UP THE CAMERA
AND LET'S GO BACK INSIDE.

1223
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,435
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT'S MY EQUIPMENT.

1224
01:00:39,486 --> 01:00:42,188
- ALL RIGHT, CALL THE POLICE.
GO, CALL THE POLICE. - REALLY, CRAIG?

1225
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:45,024
YOU WANT US TO SPREAD THE WORD
ABOUT YOUR DOCUMENTARY TECHNIQUE,

1226
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,559
ABOUT HOW YOU OVERSTEP
ALL ACCEPTABLE BOUNDARIES?

1227
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:24,927
- DO YOU NEED HELP,
MRS. LOUD? - OH.

1228
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:27,897
YES, MY HUSBAND SENT ME
FOR SOMETHING HE FORGOT.

1229
01:02:36,762 --> 01:02:38,179
HELLO.

1230
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:41,265
I'M DOING IT--
LEAVING HIM.

1231
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,302
And I want to do it
on camera.

1232
01:02:44,336 --> 01:02:46,471
THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TOO,

1233
01:02:46,505 --> 01:02:48,004
ISN'T IT,
AFTER ALL, CRAIG?

1234
01:02:48,022 --> 01:02:51,058
PATTY, I WOULD NEVER
ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

1235
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:53,060
BUT NOT TELLING
THE CHILDREN--

1236
01:02:53,111 --> 01:02:56,396
I NEED TO DO
THAT ALONE.

1237
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:59,616
AND MY BROTHER
ALONE TOO.

1238
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,035
No cameras.

1239
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,653
BUT BILL--

1240
01:03:04,687 --> 01:03:07,289
YOU CAN FILM THAT, BABY--

1241
01:03:07,324 --> 01:03:09,241
ME TELLING HIM
TO GO TO HELL,

1242
01:03:09,292 --> 01:03:10,876
NEVER COME BACK.

1243
01:03:12,529 --> 01:03:15,864
I WANT THE WOMEN OF AMERICA
TO SEE THAT.

1244
01:03:15,882 --> 01:03:18,666
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
HIS BIMBOS TO SEE.

1245
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,386
ALL RIGHT, PATTY,
WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER
AND TALK ABOUT THIS.

1246
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,921
Not you.

1247
01:03:22,972 --> 01:03:24,672
JUST ME AND BILL

1248
01:03:24,706 --> 01:03:27,375
AND ALAN AND SUSAN,
NO ONE ELSE.

1249
01:03:27,393 --> 01:03:29,594
All right.
Whatever you wish.

1250
01:03:39,821 --> 01:03:45,359
¶ WAY OVER YONDER... ¶

1251
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:50,396
THE HARDEST THING
THAT I CAN THINK OF IN LIFE

1252
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:53,032
IS DISAPPOINTING THE PEOPLE
THAT I LOVE THE MOST

1253
01:03:53,066 --> 01:03:55,734
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

1254
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:58,737
AND I'M ABOUT
TO DO THAT.

1255
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:00,590
DIVORCED?
WE CAN'T GET DIVORCED.

1256
01:04:00,624 --> 01:04:02,624
WE'RE THE AMERICAN FAMILY.

1257
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:09,714
I'LL GO TO GLENDALE
IN THE MORNING

1258
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:12,917
AND SPEAK WITH UNCLE TOM
AND AUNT YVONNE FIRST.

1259
01:04:15,371 --> 01:04:17,388
AND...

1260
01:04:17,422 --> 01:04:19,390
I'LL TELL YOUR DAD
TOMORROW NIGHT

1261
01:04:19,424 --> 01:04:22,776
WHEN HE COMES HOME.

1262
01:04:22,811 --> 01:04:25,613
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
SWEETIE.

1263
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:30,284
MOM.

1264
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,821
¶ WAY OVER YONDER ¶

1265
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:40,610
¶ THAT'S WHERE
I'M BOUND. ¶

1266
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,253
WHAT THE HELL?

1267
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:55,424
TOM?

1268
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:58,477
ALAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1269
01:04:58,511 --> 01:05:00,094
I'M LOADING THE MAG.

1270
01:05:00,128 --> 01:05:02,296
WHY?  WE'RE NOT FILMING
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

1271
01:05:02,314 --> 01:05:05,316
CRAIG CALLED ME.
HE TOLD YOU APPROVED THIS.

1272
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:06,967
CRAIG'S HERE?

1273
01:05:08,153 --> 01:05:10,321
OH, YOU ARE
UNBELIEVABLE!

1274
01:05:10,355 --> 01:05:12,273
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT LET'S HAVE A DRINK

1275
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:13,941
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.
HERE.

1276
01:05:13,975 --> 01:05:15,825
- YOU GAVE YOUR WORD.
- JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

1277
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,162
- I SAID NO FILMING HERE.
- JUST HEAR ME OUT, PLEASE.

1278
01:05:19,197 --> 01:05:20,813
NO, YOU HEAR ME OUT!

1279
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:22,982
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANT TO DO,

1280
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,002
IS HEAR YOU OUT
IN YOUR OWN WORDS,

1281
01:05:26,037 --> 01:05:28,655
SPOKEN TO PEOPLE WHO WON'T
INTERRUPT YOU OR ARGUE WITH YOU

1282
01:05:28,673 --> 01:05:31,540
OR SHUT YOU DOWN OR WALK
OUT WITHOUT LISTENING,

1283
01:05:31,591 --> 01:05:33,992
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT BILL'S GOING TO DO

1284
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:35,844
WHEN YOU GIVE HIM
HIS WALKING PAPERS.

1285
01:05:35,879 --> 01:05:38,163
AND THEN NO ONE WILL KNOW
ABOUT ALL THE YEARS OF LIES

1286
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:41,100
AND HUMILIATIONS AND BETRAYALS
THAT BROUGHT YOU TO THIS.

1287
01:05:41,134 --> 01:05:44,719
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE FANCY
WORDS ABOUT THE THRESHOLD OF PRIVACY, HUH?

1288
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:47,021
IT HAS TO BE CROSSED.
IT HAS TO BE CROSSED RIGHT NOW

1289
01:05:47,056 --> 01:05:49,507
FOR THIS FILM TO HAVE
ANY KIND OF EMOTIONAL IMPACT.

1290
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:51,676
THEN GO MAKE A GODDAMN
LASSIE MOVIE!

1291
01:05:51,694 --> 01:05:53,811
THERE'S REAL SUFFERING
HAPPENING HERE, CRAIG.

1292
01:05:53,845 --> 01:05:55,613
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
MY KIDS LAST NIGHT.

1293
01:05:55,648 --> 01:05:57,899
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR KIDS.

1294
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,967
AND THE WHOLE WORLD
SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR KIDS.

1295
01:06:00,001 --> 01:06:01,851
AND FRANKLY, WITHOUT THAT
AND WITHOUT THIS,

1296
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:04,438
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS THING
IS WORTH PUTTING ON THE AIR.

1297
01:06:04,472 --> 01:06:05,906
- THAT'S FINE BY ME.
- REALLY?

1298
01:06:05,957 --> 01:06:07,541
WHAT ABOUT ALAN
AND SUSAN AND TOMMY

1299
01:06:07,575 --> 01:06:10,544
WHO'VE WORKED 24 HOURS A DAY FOR
THE LAST GOD KNOWS HOW MANY MONTHS?

1300
01:06:10,578 --> 01:06:12,796
OR ALL THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK
WHO YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT

1301
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,463
WHO'VE BEEN SIFTING
THROUGH MORE FOOTAGE

1302
01:06:14,498 --> 01:06:17,199
THAN WAS EVER SHOT
FOR WORLD WAR II?

1303
01:06:17,217 --> 01:06:19,085
AND THE MILLION DOLLARS
THE NETWORK HAS SPENT

1304
01:06:19,136 --> 01:06:20,636
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE
IN YOU?

1305
01:06:20,671 --> 01:06:22,204
NOT ME, YOU--

1306
01:06:22,222 --> 01:06:23,839
YOU AND YOUR STORY

1307
01:06:23,873 --> 01:06:25,925
AND YOUR ABILITY
TO EXPRESS IT.

1308
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:28,093
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SONS
WHO THINK THAT THIS FILM

1309
01:06:28,144 --> 01:06:30,845
CAN CHANGE THEIR LIFE?
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

1310
01:06:30,879 --> 01:06:32,731
AND ALL THE WOMEN--

1311
01:06:32,765 --> 01:06:34,382
ALL THE WOMEN
WHO ARE OUT THERE

1312
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,935
WHO ARE IN THE SAME POSITION
AS YOU ARE RIGHT NOW,

1313
01:06:36,986 --> 01:06:39,688
BUT THEY'RE ALONE AND THEY'RE
LOST AND THEY'RE SCARED

1314
01:06:39,722 --> 01:06:42,190
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO AND YOU CAN SHOW THEM.

1315
01:06:42,224 --> 01:06:46,277
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S NOT PUT IT ON THE AIR.

1316
01:07:02,343 --> 01:07:04,761
ALL RIGHT.

1317
01:07:05,879 --> 01:07:08,047
ALL RIGHT.

1318
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:09,966
BUT YOU LISTEN TO ME.

1319
01:07:10,017 --> 01:07:12,584
LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
NOT YOU!

1320
01:07:12,602 --> 01:07:14,753
JUST SUSAN AND ALAN.

1321
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,562
WHEN BILL WOULD
GO AWAY,

1322
01:07:23,596 --> 01:07:27,064
I WAS JUST LEFT AT HOME
WITH MY OWN WORST FEARS.

1323
01:07:27,098 --> 01:07:29,266
UNRETURNED PHONE CALLS,

1324
01:07:29,284 --> 01:07:32,069
LATE-NIGHT HANG-UPS--

1325
01:07:32,103 --> 01:07:35,105
IT ALL JUST MADE ME
SO PARANOID.

1326
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:37,491
THAT BLISSFUL DELUSION
OF FAITHFULNESS,

1327
01:07:37,526 --> 01:07:40,211
THAT NEED TO BELIEVE

1328
01:07:40,245 --> 01:07:43,330
THAT EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE OKAY--

1329
01:07:43,381 --> 01:07:46,333
IT DIED THE NIGHT
OF THE FILES.

1330
01:07:48,419 --> 01:07:50,970
LIFE DOESN'T GO ON
THE WAY YOU PLAN IT.

1331
01:07:51,005 --> 01:07:54,974
WHEN YOU REFUSE
TO ACCEPT IT,

1332
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:59,127
YOU JUST BECOME
THIS UNLOVABLE PERSON.

1333
01:07:59,145 --> 01:08:01,630
I'VE MADE MISTAKES--

1334
01:08:01,648 --> 01:08:03,632
A LOT OF THEM.

1335
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,402
I THOUGHT IF BILL COULDN'T
LIVE UP TO THE TRUTH,

1336
01:08:06,436 --> 01:08:08,487
AT LEAST HE COULD LIVE UP
TO THE FACADE.

1337
01:08:11,573 --> 01:08:14,459
HOW DID THE KIDS
TAKE ALL OF THIS?

1338
01:08:14,493 --> 01:08:16,411
HARD.

1339
01:08:16,445 --> 01:08:18,646
YOU KNOW WHO TOOK IT
THE HARDEST OF ALL, DON'T YOU?

1340
01:08:18,664 --> 01:08:20,531
LANCE?

1341
01:08:20,582 --> 01:08:23,701
HE'S THE ONE
HE UNDERSTOOD THE LEAST.

1342
01:08:25,104 --> 01:08:26,986
HEY.

1343
01:08:31,826 --> 01:08:33,827
I'M CUTTING.

1344
01:08:37,932 --> 01:08:39,800
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1345
01:08:39,834 --> 01:08:41,517
LISTEN, I KNOW
THAT WASN'T EASY.

1346
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,001
COME ON.

1347
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:45,938
ACTUALLY, I THINK
IT WAS MY BEST SCENE.

1348
01:08:45,972 --> 01:08:48,190
PATTY, I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET.

1349
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:51,310
BUT AFTER TONIGHT,
THE HARD PART IS OVER.

1350
01:08:51,344 --> 01:08:53,813
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

1351
01:08:55,981 --> 01:08:59,067
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.  COME ON.

1352
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,405
COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO THE HOUSE BEFORE BILL.

1353
01:09:03,456 --> 01:09:04,906
COME ON!

1354
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:07,709
BARBARA, IT'S PATTY.

1355
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:09,793
LISTEN,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

1356
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:12,579
YOU NEED TO TELL BILL
NOT TO COME HOME TONIGHT.

1357
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:14,581
I CHANGED MY MIND
ABOUT SOMETHING

1358
01:09:14,632 --> 01:09:16,834
AND I DON'T
WANT HIM HOME.

1359
01:09:16,868 --> 01:09:18,552
HEY, MAN, YOUR MOM.

1360
01:09:18,586 --> 01:09:20,471
GRANT, HONEY,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

1361
01:09:20,505 --> 01:09:22,423
EXCUSE US.

1362
01:09:22,474 --> 01:09:24,540
I NEED YOU TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL YOUR FATHER.

1363
01:09:24,558 --> 01:09:26,542
- WHAT?
- I KNOW.

1364
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,544
HOW CAN YOU ASK ME
TO DO THAT, MOM?

1365
01:09:28,562 --> 01:09:30,396
HOPEFULLY BARBARA WILL
HAVE GOTTEN TO HIM IN TIME

1366
01:09:30,431 --> 01:09:32,648
AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING,
SWEETIE. BUT IF SHE HASN'T--

1367
01:09:32,683 --> 01:09:34,484
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO SAY TO HIM?

1368
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:37,553
THE TRUTH.  TELL HIM THAT I'M
TELLING HIM TO MOVE OUT AND THAT I--

1369
01:09:37,571 --> 01:09:40,272
I DON'T WANT TO HUMILIATE HIM
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA, HONEY.

1370
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:43,775
YOU'LL BE DOING YOUR FATHER
A FAVOR THAT HE'LL NEVER FORGET.

1371
01:09:48,498 --> 01:09:52,734
¶ SOMEBODY HOLDS
THE KEY ¶

1372
01:09:52,752 --> 01:09:57,872
¶ BUT I CAN'T FIND
MY WAY HOME ¶

1373
01:09:57,906 --> 01:10:03,427
¶ STILL I CAN'T
FIND MY WAY HOME ¶

1374
01:10:03,462 --> 01:10:07,097
¶ AND I AIN'T DONE
NOTHING WRONG... ¶

1375
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:09,632
MY BIG MAN'S BEEN HAULING
CONCRETE FOR A LIVING,

1376
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:12,302
- YEAH.
- STRONG AS AN OX.

1377
01:10:15,589 --> 01:10:18,591
HAS YOUR MOTHER BEEN
DRIVING THE MERCEDES?

1378
01:10:18,609 --> 01:10:20,977
GRANT?

1379
01:10:21,028 --> 01:10:23,195
UH, THE MERCEDES.

1380
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:25,931
YEAH.  YES.

1381
01:10:25,949 --> 01:10:28,433
DID YOU TALK TO YOUR
SECRETARY TODAY?

1382
01:10:28,451 --> 01:10:30,452
NO, I HAVEN'T.
WHY?

1383
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:33,071
NOTHING.
I WAS JUST WONDERING

1384
01:10:33,105 --> 01:10:35,123
HOW EVERYTHING WAS
GOING AT THE OFFICE.

1385
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:38,876
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER
ASKED ME THAT BEFORE.

1386
01:10:38,911 --> 01:10:41,445
IT MUST BE BECAUSE YOU'RE
EARNING YOUR KEEP THIS SUMMER.

1387
01:10:41,463 --> 01:10:43,381
NOW YOU CAN APPRECIATE
WHAT IT TAKES

1388
01:10:43,415 --> 01:10:45,282
TO BRING HOME
A BUCK OR TWO.

1389
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,468
I SOMETIMES WONDER
IF YOUR MOTHER HAD TO WORK

1390
01:10:47,503 --> 01:10:50,588
WHETHER SHE'D HAVE MORE
APPRECIATION FOR THE OLD MAN.

1391
01:10:51,723 --> 01:10:53,340
HOW'S SHE DOING,
BY THE WAY?

1392
01:10:54,509 --> 01:10:56,810
MOM?  SHE'S GOOD.

1393
01:10:56,844 --> 01:10:58,962
YOU KNOW MOM.

1394
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:02,632
I SURE DO.
I SURE DO.

1395
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,137
¶ The changing ¶

1396
01:11:09,155 --> 01:11:11,440
¶ Of sunlight ¶

1397
01:11:11,474 --> 01:11:13,809
¶ To moonlight ¶

1398
01:11:13,827 --> 01:11:18,747
¶ Reflections
of my life ¶

1399
01:11:18,782 --> 01:11:24,002
¶ Oh, how they fill
my eyes... ¶

1400
01:11:29,124 --> 01:11:32,126
Nixon devalued the dollar today.
Did you know that?

1401
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:43,971
WELL, IT'S LIT UP
LIKE CHRISTMAS IN HERE.

1402
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:49,393
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

1403
01:11:49,444 --> 01:11:52,862
- I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO SEE YOU. - WHY NOT?

1404
01:11:52,896 --> 01:11:55,281
COME ON, BILL.
WE BOTH KNOW.

1405
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:58,284
- KNOW WHAT?
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM?

1406
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:00,336
DIDN'T YOU GET A CALL
FROM BARBARA?

1407
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:02,855
I DIDN'T TALK
TO HER TODAY.

1408
01:12:02,873 --> 01:12:04,857
DIDN'T GRANT
SAY ANYTHING?

1409
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:06,825
GRANT?
ABOUT WHAT?

1410
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:08,994
- BIG D!
- HI, DAD.

1411
01:12:09,028 --> 01:12:11,880
- OH.
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1412
01:12:11,914 --> 01:12:14,699
AT LEAST SOMEBODY IS GLAD
TO SEE ME COME HOME.

1413
01:12:14,717 --> 01:12:17,702
NOW WHAT'S THIS ABOUT
BARBARA NOW? WHAT DID--?

1414
01:12:17,737 --> 01:12:19,921
BILL, DON'T YOU KNOW?

1415
01:12:19,972 --> 01:12:21,805
WHAT?

1416
01:12:22,974 --> 01:12:24,975
DON'T BE PLAYING
WITH ME, BILL.

1417
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:28,262
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1418
01:12:28,313 --> 01:12:30,598
YOU DON'T KNOW
THERE'S A PROBLEM?

1419
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:33,350
NO.  WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

1420
01:12:33,384 --> 01:12:35,735
WHAT--?

1421
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:38,488
WELL, THIS IS KEEN.

1422
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:42,659
UH, LOOK, LET'S NOT
SPILL ANY BLOOD HERE.

1423
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:46,913
I'VE BEEN TO SEE A LAWYER.
THIS IS HIS CARD.

1424
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:49,198
YOU CAN GIVE HIM
A CALL TOMORROW.

1425
01:12:49,232 --> 01:12:50,866
OH.

1426
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,834
I WANT YOU TO MOVE OUT--

1427
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,621
TONIGHT, NOW.

1428
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:59,875
JUST TURN AROUND AND GET OUT.

1429
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:03,244
REALLY?

1430
01:13:03,262 --> 01:13:05,245
WE'RE DONE, BILL.

1431
01:13:05,263 --> 01:13:07,465
THE MARRIAGE IS OVER.

1432
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:10,718
- JUST LIKE THAT?
- JUST LIKE THAT.

1433
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:16,390
22 YEARS
JUST LIKE THAT.

1434
01:13:16,424 --> 01:13:18,592
JUST LIKE THAT.

1435
01:13:21,946 --> 01:13:23,980
WELL,

1436
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:25,615
FAIR DEAL.

1437
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:28,318
I FIGURED
YOU'D THINK THAT.

1438
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:33,272
WELL, I THINK THAT

1439
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:38,077
IT'S A LITTLE--

1440
01:13:38,111 --> 01:13:40,462
A LITTLE SHORTSIGHTED
ON YOUR PART.

1441
01:13:40,497 --> 01:13:43,632
- DO YOU, BILL?
- I REALLY DO.

1442
01:13:52,975 --> 01:13:57,628
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU DIDN'T PICK
THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE.

1443
01:13:57,646 --> 01:13:59,797
HE'LL BE IN HIS
OFFICE TOMORROW,

1444
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:02,316
EXPECTING A CALL
FROM YOU.

1445
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:04,134
I'VE BEEN TO THE BANK,

1446
01:14:04,152 --> 01:14:06,520
MADE COPIES
OF OUR TAX FORMS.

1447
01:14:07,855 --> 01:14:09,973
RIGHT.

1448
01:14:13,244 --> 01:14:15,195
AND YOU'VE GOT
THE KIDS

1449
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:18,781
PRETTY SHAPED UP,
HAVE YOU?

1450
01:14:18,815 --> 01:14:21,200
THEY ALL UNDERSTAND
THE PROBLEM,

1451
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:23,819
THAT IT'S ONLY
BETWEEN US.

1452
01:14:25,589 --> 01:14:28,490
WELL, I GUESS I DON'T
HAVE TO UNPACK NOW, DO I?

1453
01:15:02,322 --> 01:15:04,523
HEY, GUYS.

1454
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,409
HOW ARE WE DOING
IN HERE, BIG D?

1455
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:09,162
NOT SO GOOD, DAD.

1456
01:15:09,196 --> 01:15:11,681
NONE OF US ARE.

1457
01:15:17,553 --> 01:15:22,224
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW THE
NUMBER TO THE LEMON TREE, DO YOU?

1458
01:15:24,594 --> 01:15:27,062
THEY ALREADY HAVE
A ROOM FOR YOU.

1459
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:32,900
OH.

1460
01:15:34,352 --> 01:15:36,520
THAT'S HANDY.

1461
01:15:39,741 --> 01:15:41,358
I HAVE TO GO, DAD.

1462
01:15:41,392 --> 01:15:45,745
- WELL, STAY IN TOUCH NOW.
- YEAH.

1463
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,498
- HONEY.
- YEAH?

1464
01:15:51,085 --> 01:15:52,869
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE FINE.

1465
01:15:55,372 --> 01:15:57,406
BYE, DAD.

1466
01:16:00,426 --> 01:16:02,544
PATTY...

1467
01:16:04,747 --> 01:16:06,849
IF GLEN BERNSON
CALLS ME,

1468
01:16:06,883 --> 01:16:10,719
MAKE SURE HE CALLS ME
AT THE LEMON TREE.

1469
01:16:10,753 --> 01:16:13,355
WE'VE GOT A HUGE ORDER
IN DAYTON.

1470
01:16:13,389 --> 01:16:17,258
AND MERRIWETHER--
YOU REMEMBER HIM--

1471
01:16:17,276 --> 01:16:20,478
HE'S GOING TO TRY
TO SELL BERNSON

1472
01:16:20,529 --> 01:16:24,315
THE SAME DAMN THING,
AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN.

1473
01:16:24,366 --> 01:16:26,984
WE REALLY CAN'T.

1474
01:18:59,076 --> 01:19:01,044
ANOTHER ONE.

1475
01:19:01,078 --> 01:19:04,264
- LANCE?
- LANCE.

1476
01:19:04,298 --> 01:19:06,266
- JUST A SECOND.
- LANCE, CAN I GET A PICTURE?

1477
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,802
- THANK YOU.
- ONE MORE, PLEASE.

1478
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:14,106
WOW, LOOKS LIKE
IT'S A HIT ALREADY.

1479
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,925
WELCOME TO TONIGHT'S
PREMIERE SCREENING.

1480
01:19:16,943 --> 01:19:18,894
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE PRODUCER

1481
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:21,430
AND CREATOR OF
"AN AMERICAN FAMILY,"

1482
01:19:21,448 --> 01:19:24,483
THE AWARD-WINNING FILMMAKER
CRAIG GILBERT.

1483
01:19:28,454 --> 01:19:31,990
THANK YOU AND WELCOME TO EPISODE
ONE OF "AN AMERICAN FAMILY."

1484
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:33,791
- CAMERON, LOOK AT THIS.
- BEFORE WE BEGIN,

1485
01:19:33,826 --> 01:19:35,710
I WOULD BE REMISS
IN NOT THANKING THE LOUDS.

1486
01:19:35,744 --> 01:19:38,579
- YOU SEE THIS?
- THEIR COURAGE STILL INSPIRES ME

1487
01:19:38,613 --> 01:19:41,014
AND THEIR TRUST
HUMBLES ME.

1488
01:19:41,049 --> 01:19:44,134
SO WITHOUT
FURTHER ADO,

1489
01:19:44,168 --> 01:19:47,337
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
"AN AMERICAN FAMILY."

1490
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:01,567
Six, five, four, three...

1491
01:20:01,601 --> 01:20:04,970
 It's another New Year's Eve
for the Loud family.

1492
01:20:04,988 --> 01:20:07,606
But this year will be
much different.

1493
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,159
For the very first time,
Pat and her husband Bill

1494
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:13,478
are living separately
after 20 years of marriage...

1495
01:20:13,496 --> 01:20:15,447
"PATTY LOUD SEES NO WAY

1496
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:17,532
OUT OF A FALSE MARRIAGE
EXCEPT BOOZE."

1497
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:20,285
- Please, Lance.
- HOLD ON, LISTEN TO THIS.

1498
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:24,371
"LANCE OOZES HIS
LEECH-LIKE HOMOSEXUALITY

1499
01:20:24,422 --> 01:20:28,959
WITH THE GLEE OF A GROTESQUE,
GOYA-ESQUE EMOTIONAL DWARF."

1500
01:20:28,993 --> 01:20:31,712
WHAT?  NO NO NO.
OH MY GOD.

1501
01:20:31,763 --> 01:20:33,497
Oh my God,
what have I done?

1502
01:20:33,515 --> 01:20:36,016
I NEVER WANT TO SEE
THAT MAN AGAIN.

1503
01:20:36,051 --> 01:20:40,019
MOM, I'M--
I'M COMING HOME.

1504
01:20:40,054 --> 01:20:43,189
AND WE'RE GONNA WATCH
THE SHOW WHEN IT AIRS

1505
01:20:43,223 --> 01:20:45,007
TOGETHER, ALL OF US,

1506
01:20:45,025 --> 01:20:47,610
ALL OF US AS A FAMILY.

1507
01:20:47,644 --> 01:20:50,113
They are an American family,

1508
01:20:50,147 --> 01:20:52,115
the family next door
on the surface.

1509
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:54,232
10 million viewers
watch them every week

1510
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:56,701
on the most popular,
most watched series

1511
01:20:56,736 --> 01:20:59,071
that educational television
has ever tackled.

1512
01:20:59,122 --> 01:21:02,240
And those 10 million people
have heard the Louds say things

1513
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:05,827
that many people wouldn't tell
their lovers or tax accountants.

1514
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,379
You are a pathetic fool.

1515
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:09,696
Why don't we
discuss this later?

1516
01:21:09,714 --> 01:21:11,882
You don't know
there's a problem?

1517
01:21:11,917 --> 01:21:14,034
No. What's your problem?

1518
01:21:14,052 --> 01:21:16,303
I've been to see a lawyer.
This is his card.

1519
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:19,090
You can give him
a call tomorrow.

1520
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:20,674
I want you
to move out.

1521
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:23,560
It's a West-coast bourgeois
all-American freefall.

1522
01:21:23,594 --> 01:21:26,513
There is a tremendous amount
wrong with this family

1523
01:21:26,547 --> 01:21:27,981
and very little right.

1524
01:21:28,015 --> 01:21:31,184
I for one view them
as a true American tragedy.

1525
01:21:31,218 --> 01:21:34,437
But they have one child
who has not turned out well.

1526
01:21:34,488 --> 01:21:36,156
What they didn't
realize is that

1527
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:39,057
people were not
going to look at it
as an art form,

1528
01:21:39,075 --> 01:21:41,393
that they were going
to begin criticizing them
as people.

1529
01:21:41,411 --> 01:21:43,112
People dissected
this family

1530
01:21:43,163 --> 01:21:44,746
in order to call
into question

1531
01:21:44,781 --> 01:21:47,616
not only an American family,
but the American family.

1532
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:49,952
...role as a father, but that
that role was of a pal.

1533
01:21:50,003 --> 01:21:51,753
Have you seen Lance Loud
and that get-up?

1534
01:21:51,788 --> 01:21:53,671
Here was a family
with very serious problems.

1535
01:21:53,705 --> 01:21:55,706
Is there or is there not such
a thing as a sense of shame?

1536
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:58,676
It's just-- it's shocking.
And I wouldn't want anybody...

1537
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:54,344
SO SENSATIONALISM WAS
HIS GOAL FROM THE GET-GO.

1538
01:22:54,395 --> 01:22:56,263
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.

1539
01:22:56,297 --> 01:22:58,632
HE WANTED TO CREATE
A SUCCESSFUL SHOW,

1540
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:01,185
BUT HE WAS ALSO
ON A PERSONAL MISSION.

1541
01:23:01,236 --> 01:23:02,903
COULD THAT EXPLAIN
WHAT WENT WRONG?

1542
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:05,905
CRAIG DIDN'T SEARCH
FOR THE PERFECT FAMILY.

1543
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:09,108
HE SEARCHED FOR THE FAMILY
THAT WAS PERFECT FOR HIS AGENDA.

1544
01:23:09,142 --> 01:23:11,027
ANYBODY WANT PIZZA?

1545
01:23:11,078 --> 01:23:13,812
- PIZZA? - OH MY GOD,
I'M AFRAID TO ANSWER IT.

1546
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,336
- HELLO? - HAVE YOU READ
THIS STUFF, PATTY?

1547
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,337
- IT'S YOUR FATHER.
- Get this-- "The father,

1548
01:23:22,371 --> 01:23:24,339
COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH
WITH ANY WORLD

1549
01:23:24,373 --> 01:23:26,958
EXCEPT THE FALSE ONE
HE INHABITS, REACHES OUT..."

1550
01:23:26,992 --> 01:23:29,211
WHY DON'T WE INVITE
YOUR DAD TO PIZZA?

1551
01:23:31,013 --> 01:23:32,380
HMM?

1552
01:23:32,415 --> 01:23:34,833
WELL, WE ARE A
CULTURAL PHENOMENON

1553
01:23:34,867 --> 01:23:38,335
AND THE MOST DESPISED
FAMILY IN AMERICA.

1554
01:23:38,353 --> 01:23:40,504
IT'S REALLY ALL TOO
GLAMOROUS TO HANDLE.

1555
01:23:40,522 --> 01:23:42,005
REALLY.
HONESTLY.

1556
01:23:42,023 --> 01:23:44,074
I DON'T WANT
TO BE DESPISED.

1557
01:23:44,109 --> 01:23:47,228
WELL, THEN WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO FIGHT BACK.

1558
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:49,862
WON'T WE, SWEETHEART?

1559
01:23:58,706 --> 01:24:01,190
"The Dick Cavett Show!"

1560
01:24:02,859 --> 01:24:05,527
WE'RE DOING THIS SHOW
AND A DOZEN OTHERS LIKE IT

1561
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:07,412
BECAUSE WE WANT
PEOPLE TO KNOW

1562
01:24:07,463 --> 01:24:10,365
THAT WE ARE NOT
MONSTERS OR IDIOTS.

1563
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:12,417
WE'RE PRETTY
DECENT PEOPLE

1564
01:24:12,468 --> 01:24:14,553
AND DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE WERE SIGNING UP FOR.

1565
01:24:14,587 --> 01:24:16,805
WE'VE LOST DIGNITY,
AND-- AND--

1566
01:24:16,839 --> 01:24:19,590
AND WE'VE BEEN HUMILIATED
AS A RESULT OF IT.

1567
01:24:19,641 --> 01:24:22,176
OUR HONOR
IS AT QUESTION

1568
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,679
AND I FEEL VERY DEFENSIVE,
AS CRAIG BROUGHT UP.

1569
01:24:24,713 --> 01:24:27,648
PEOPLE HAVE A MUCH DIFFERENT
IMAGE OF THEMSELVES

1570
01:24:27,683 --> 01:24:29,717
THAN SOMETIMES
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE OF THEM.

1571
01:24:29,735 --> 01:24:34,104
I THINK WE'RE MOST HORRIFIED BY THE
THINGS IN OURSELVES THAT WE'RE SCARED OF.

1572
01:24:34,155 --> 01:24:37,524
- WHEN I SAW MYSELF BILLED
AS "HOMO OF THE YEAR 1971..."

1573
01:24:37,558 --> 01:24:39,943
...I WAS REALLY
DESPONDENT FOR A WHILE.

1574
01:24:39,994 --> 01:24:42,862
BUT I KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING
TO COME OFF AS ANYWAY.

1575
01:24:42,896 --> 01:24:44,998
THEY'VE SORT OF
CATEGORIZED US.

1576
01:24:45,032 --> 01:24:47,534
ONE THING IS
THAT YOU BECOME OBLIGED

1577
01:24:47,568 --> 01:24:49,702
UNDER THAT CAMERA
TO REACT IN SOME WAY.

1578
01:24:49,736 --> 01:24:52,171
YOU TRY TO COME UP WITH
SOME PLATO-LIKE DECISION

1579
01:24:52,205 --> 01:24:53,589
WHEN THE CAMERA'S
ROLLING.

1580
01:24:53,623 --> 01:24:55,341
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

1581
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57,576
ANYBODY WHO'S IN SHOW BUSINESS
WOULD HAVE TO CALL YOU NAIVE

1582
01:24:57,594 --> 01:25:00,045
TO THINK THAT YOU COULD THINK
THAT YOU COULD APPEAR ON TELEVISION

1583
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:02,014
AND NOT HAVE IT
SELECTED, EDITED.

1584
01:25:02,048 --> 01:25:04,048
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG
WITH BEING NAIVE.

1585
01:25:04,082 --> 01:25:06,417
I SEE SOMETHING REALLY WRONG
WITH BEING SOPHISTICATED.

1586
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:09,404
CERTAINLY NO OTHER AMERICAN FAMILY
HAS BEEN THOUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

1587
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:13,274
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND
BEING SO OUTSPOKEN AND ACCESSIBLE.

1588
01:25:13,309 --> 01:25:15,276
AND WE WILL SEE YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT.

1589
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:18,061
TO THE LOUDS

1590
01:25:18,095 --> 01:25:20,280
AND OUR 14th MINUTE OF FAME.

1591
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:22,449
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.

1592
01:25:22,483 --> 01:25:25,101
LET'S MILK OUR LAST MINUTE
FOR ALL THAT IT'S WORTH.

1593
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:27,120
YEAH.
