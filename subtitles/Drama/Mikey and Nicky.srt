1
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:42,314
It's 7-1-2-7-4-3-1.

2
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,488
Mikey?

3
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,586
I'm in trouble.

4
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,694
Can you talk?

5
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:04,366
I'm in a phone booth,
Montel and Grand

6
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,033
the southwest side of the street,
all right?

7
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:13,705
Don't bring your own car.
Don't come all the way with a taxi.

8
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,774
Stop around three blocks and then
walk the rest of the way, all right?

9
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:21,446
The phone booth, right.
All right.

10
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,324
Bring cigarettes, huh?

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,059
Son of a bitch.

12
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,301
Yes.

13
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:18,603
Nick? It's Mikey.

14
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,699
Nick.

15
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:28,106
Nick, it's me.
It's Mikey from the corner.

16
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:31,412
I came as soon as I got your towel.

17
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:39,589
What are you doing in there?

18
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:47,196
Nick?

19
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:50,259
What are you doing in there?

20
00:04:56,276 --> 00:05:02,112
Open the door, Nicky.
Open the door and let me in.

21
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:06,482
Nick, you're gonna have to let me in
now. I don't know the rest of the tune.

22
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:09,386
- Schmuck, open the door, will ya?
- Mikey!

23
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:14,551
Mikey!

24
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:17,119
Open the door, Nick.

25
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:24,196
- Mikey!
- It's Mikey, yes.

26
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:28,372
- You can't come in.
- What do you mean?

27
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:30,569
What did you call me for
if you don't want me to come in?

28
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:34,478
- Come on, Nick. Open the door.
- I don't want you to see me like this.

29
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:36,675
Will you stop being a horse's ass?

30
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,550
What way am I going to see you I haven't
seen you before? Open the door.

31
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,417
Open it!

32
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:57,095
Come on, Nick!
Open it up!

33
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:02,466
Everybody's comin'!
They're all comin' now!

34
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:13,352
I swear to Christ.
Don't shoot me, whatever you do.

35
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:24,152
You almost took my eye out
with the bottle.

36
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:29,032
Jesus Christ.
There's nobody here.

37
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,036
Hey, come on.

38
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,567
Look at me, will you, Nick?
Come on.

39
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:40,112
Christ's sake.

40
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,715
Hey, hey, come here.

41
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,913
Come here, come here, come here.

42
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,314
Here.

43
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,926
Hey, hey, hey.

44
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:15,171
Hey, take it easy.
You understand me?

45
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:19,548
- I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die!
- You're not gonna die.

46
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,884
All right, take it easy.
All right.

47
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:26,915
- I'm scared. Oh, boy.
- I know you are.

48
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:30,588
- I am so scared.
- I know.

49
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:34,326
Come on.
Stop fuckin' yourself up.

50
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,370
You know, I don't shave.
Did you know that?

51
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:41,567
I don't take care of myself.
I think, if I don't take care of myself

52
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:45,099
and I sit still and I don't move,
maybe they'll forget about me.

53
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:51,180
But then I'm scared of that too,
because I think maybe

54
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:58,381
if I sit there too long, maybe when
I want to move, I won't be able to move.

55
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,091
You sound like you're ready
for a straitjacket.

56
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:08,428
- I'm gonna die.
- Come on.

57
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:13,063
You're not gonna die.

58
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,267
You see the picture of Ed Lipsky?
In the paper?

59
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:19,176
You see it on Tuesday?
In Tuesday's paper?

60
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,769
Yeah, that was terrible.

61
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:24,180
He was all shot up.
His neck was broken. You see that?

62
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,310
But, uh

63
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:30,686
nobody thought you had
anything to do with Lipsky, Nick.

64
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:33,191
You're in the clear.

65
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,489
There's a contract out on me.

66
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,892
There's a contract out
on Ed Lipsky and me.

67
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,734
I know that for a fact.

68
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:54,446
Resnick put it out. I know it
for a fact they're gonna kill me.

69
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:56,607
- Nick.
- They're gonna kill me.

70
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:59,880
- You are not gonna die.
- Oh, boy.

71
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:03,753
Even if somebody wants to kill you,
that doesn't mean you're going to die.

72
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:07,281
- They're gonna kill me.
- I want you to stop.

73
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:13,362
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

74
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,792
Your stomach?

75
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:21,301
Your stomach?

76
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,934
Answer me.

77
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,875
You did it.

78
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:30,177
You worked yourself right up
into an ulcer. Come on.

79
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,846
Get up. Get up. Come on.
Come on, get on the bed.

80
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,481
Come on.

81
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:46,156
- Here. Take this.
- What?

82
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:47,665
- Take it.
- What is it?

83
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:49,099
- Take it.
- I don't want this.

84
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:51,467
Take it or I'll shove it
down your throat. Open your mouth.

85
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:52,664
I'm gonna vomit it up.
I don't want it.

86
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,366
I don't want it.

87
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:57,308
If you vomit,
I will give you another one, dry.

88
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:58,674
- What is that?
- It's poison.

89
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,406
- What is it?
- It's Gelusil.

90
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,448
What do you think it is, moron?
Come on.

91
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:06,451
- How come you brought Gelusil?
- Nick, I know you for 30 years.

92
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,819
You call me, you say "come right away"
in that voice, I bring Gelusil.

93
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,188
- Now, come on.
- I can't swallow.

94
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:17,320
Try. If you throw it up,
I'll give you another one. Come on.

95
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:20,924
- Nick. Come on. Just chew it.
- Please. Don't.

96
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,265
They don't taste bad.
Come on.

97
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:27,932
Open the door,
let the train come in.

98
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:30,373
Come on, open the door.

99
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,780
You didn't smoke, did you?
You don't wanna feel better.

100
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:40,012
You want to die.

101
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:42,077
There.

102
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,619
- All right, cry.
- I'm scared.

103
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:50,988
You gotta take them.

104
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:59,063
Chew it. That's it.

105
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,733
Chew it up
and swallow it.

106
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:06,541
Come on. That's right.
That's right. Swallow it.

107
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:10,549
Okay. Give me the room key.
I'm gonna get you some half and half.

108
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:14,678
Nick, there's a coffee shop
around the corner. Now, listen to me.

109
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,551
- I will be right back.
- I don't want you to go.

110
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,614
- Nick, ten minutes.
- No.

111
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,921
I'll give you my watch.
You can check me.

112
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:25,363
- I will only be gone ten minutes. Nick.
- Don't go.

113
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:28,696
You're eating up the lining of your
stomach. Do you want to die?

114
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:32,898
That ulcer's going to perforate.
I have to get you some half and half.

115
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:39,002
I'll be back in five minutes.
Come on, stop that.

116
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:42,673
All right, I'm going.
Here.

117
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:47,311
- Here, it's 9:15. Hold the watch.
- Don't go.

118
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:51,414
In ten minutes, when the hand
hits 9:25, I'm gonna be back.

119
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,482
- I'm goin'. I gotta go.
- Wait, wait.

120
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,324
I gotta go.
Let go of my tie.

121
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:59,991
Let go of my tie.
Let go of my tie.

122
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,966
You're not back in ten minutes,
I'm not gonna let you in.

123
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:06,665
Good. Try and take
another Gelusil.

124
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,877
Good night.

125
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,948
Give me some milk and some cream
in separate cartons to go.

126
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:54,009
Some skim milk?

127
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,021
- No cream?
- Not to go.

128
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:59,252
What do you put in the coffee here?
You have any cream?

129
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:03,193
- We use these little bottles here.
- Okay, give me 15 of those to go.

130
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:07,495
- Give me a couple cartons of milk.
- We don't give these bottles to go.

131
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:11,435
You want coffee to go, I put the
cream in here and use the dispenser.

132
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,836
All right, give me a carton of cream
from the dispenser.

133
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:17,502
- How many coffees?
- No coffees, just a carton of cream.

134
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:21,775
I can't do that. I'd have to charge.
Cream is for coffee only, not for sale.

135
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,783
Charge me for 15 coffees
and give me the cream.

136
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,342
- Fifteen coffees?
- That's right.

137
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:37,823
You give me that in 30 seconds,
you hear me? Or I'll kill you!

138
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:39,831
- Okay. Okay.
- Because I'm crazy!

139
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,426
- Now, give it to me!
- Yes, sir. Okay. Okay.

140
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,563
Give it to me!
Come near me and I'll kill you!

141
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:05,818
Nick, Mikey.

142
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:14,191
I got it.
What's the matter?

143
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:18,897
There's no one here, Nicky.
There is no one here.

144
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:20,963
Please.

145
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:31,405
What, look at this.
Would you believe? Ugh.

146
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:34,843
Murder.

147
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,083
All right.

148
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:48,066
Good enough, huh?
Huh?

149
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:55,370
That's good.
You're doin' good.

150
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,840
So, how did you know
there was a contract out on you?

151
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:09,648
Hmm?

152
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:12,247
- A guy I know told me.
- What guy?

153
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,691
A guy I know.
Wanted to do me a favor.

154
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:17,025
- Well, who was it?
- A friend of mine. A guy.

155
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:19,997
A friend of mine, wanted to do me
a favor. What difference does it make?

156
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:21,192
What do you mean,
what difference does it make?

157
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,701
Was it a doorman?
Was it Frank Costello? Who was it?

158
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,797
I can't tell you.
But you gotta trust me.

159
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:31,605
I know.
Take my word for it.

160
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:34,976
I'm telling you
it was someone I know.

161
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:37,846
Were you in on this deal with Lipsky?

162
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:41,011
Are you crazy?
I didn't even know Lipsky

163
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,453
until Resnick brought him
into the bank.

164
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,252
The runners knew him
better than I did.

165
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:47,918
Well, how do you know
it's even true?

166
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:50,690
I got a better one for you:
How do you know it's not true?

167
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:54,264
- How much money you got on you?
- I got $1,000.

168
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:58,429
- $1,000 right here.
- All right. I'll send you the rest.

169
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:01,132
Come on. I don't want
to call the airport from here.

170
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:03,368
- Wait a minute. Where are we going?
- I'm going to get you out of town.

171
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:06,935
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

172
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,914
Listen, Nick, if they're
really looking for you

173
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:14,476
and you say they are,
then they're gonna find you.

174
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:16,419
Especially in the place
you picked to hide out in.

175
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:21,358
- You're eight blocks from the office.
- You said they weren't looking for me.

176
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:24,021
- But you said you knew they were.
- You said they weren't looking for me.

177
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:29,262
Which way do you want it, Nick...
they're looking for you or they're not?

178
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:32,463
- They're looking for me.
- Then let's go.

179
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:35,871
Because two days of looking
gives them a hell of an edge.

180
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:40,072
- You got any clothes you wanna take?
- I don't feel good.

181
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:44,410
- I don't feel good at all.
- Goddamn it!

182
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:46,247
What's the matter?

183
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,413
Open the window, quick.
Open the window, quick! Mikey!

184
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:56,284
- What's the matter?
- Gotta get some cold air in here.

185
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:59,559
- They're not gonna find you...
- Gotta get outta here.

186
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:02,931
I can't breathe.
There's no air in this room.

187
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:05,596
Gotta get out.
I'm gonna get outta here.

188
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,640
Come on. Come on.
Get.

189
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,801
Come on. Come on!

190
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,373
- Come on!
- You're gonna wake up the whole place.

191
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:18,315
- Which way... stairs or elevator?
- The elevator.

192
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,648
Stairs. Come on!

193
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:46,972
- You're ridiculous.
- Would you go out there, first?

194
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,344
- Yes, I will go out first.
- Will you go out first?

195
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:52,509
Yes, I will go out first.
But there is nobody there.

196
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:54,109
I'm the only one
that knows you're here.

197
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:57,088
- Then why don't you go out first?
- I'm going out first.

198
00:17:57,156 --> 00:18:00,023
Wait a minute.

199
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:03,255
- What's the matter?
- Will you wear my jacket?

200
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:05,388
- Huh?
- Will you wear my jacket?

201
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:10,195
What do you think...
I'm fingering you?

202
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:15,070
No. But you don't believe there's
anyone out there. I do.

203
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:17,769
So, if I'm right,
why won't you wear my jacket?

204
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:21,570
Give it to me.

205
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:32,581
- Here you are.
- Here you are.

206
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,653
- Here's my coat.
- Are you tired?

207
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:39,164
Make sure you put that on
because it's damp outside.

208
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:41,291
Give me your coat. You want me
to wear this too, don't you?

209
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:42,595
Sure.

210
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,898
You want me to leave this open
so they can see the jacket?

211
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,836
- No, that won't be necessary.
- Fine.

212
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:50,273
Why bother?
There's no one out there, right?

213
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:59,815
- Can I have your watch?
- You wanna wear my watch?

214
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:02,877
I'll be very careful. I want it
for luck. It's just for luck.

215
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:07,051
All right, I'll let you wear my watch.
Will you let me carry your gun?

216
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:09,924
- What for?
- For luck.

217
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:12,396
If somebody thinks I'm you
and they shoot at me

218
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,298
it'd be lucky if I could shoot back.

219
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:18,826
Put this on.
I don't want you to catch cold.

220
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:25,105
You catch a cold on top of
your ulcer, that's all I need.

221
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:26,804
There's the gun.

222
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:29,211
Go ahead.

223
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,409
There's the gun.

224
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:37,445
You're crazy.

225
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,949
Here's the watch.

226
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:46,287
- Okay.
- All right.

227
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:22,498
<i>We'll have to
go away from here.</i>

228
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,971
<i>- You all right?
- I don't know.</i>

229
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:47,482
All right?

230
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,028
That's right.

231
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:52,087
Right.

232
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,423
<i>Very good.</i>

233
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:09,939
B and O.
Initials B and O, right?

234
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,918
Okay. Second and what?

235
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,417
All right, all right.
I got ya. Second Street. All right.

236
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:24,395
Second and South.
Hold it.

237
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:32,164
All right. He's wearing
a dark raincoat? A dark navy.

238
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:36,808
All right. Now, I've got
some instructions to give you.

239
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:42,610
I figure 15, 20 minutes from here.
That depends on how bad the traffic is.

240
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:44,706
All right, now, when they get
to Second and South

241
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:47,912
I'll call the B and O Tavern

242
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:50,785
I let the phone ring three times.

243
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:53,791
You understand that?
When you hear the phone ring

244
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:56,293
I want you out of the bar
on the street.

245
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:58,193
When you're on the street,
I'm gonna make my move.

246
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:03,065
I don't want to spend more than ten
minutes out on that street, understand?

247
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:06,832
Florida. Florida.

248
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:08,897
Nick?

249
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,006
There's very little
that goes out at night.

250
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,482
T.W.A. No, that's tomorrow.

251
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:22,214
American. That's tomorrow
to San Francisco.

252
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:24,813
There's one T.W.A. At 11:00.

253
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,620
I don't want to go to the airport.

254
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:33,095
- You don't want to go to the airport.
- No.

255
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:37,101
He could have
the whole airport surrounded.

256
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:39,364
Nick

257
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:42,339
He would have to hire an army.

258
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,876
Do you know what it would cost
to cover an entire airport?

259
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:47,708
Plus the cost of the contract.
You're not worth it.

260
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,271
I don't want to go to the airport.

261
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:53,477
What do you want to do?
You want to take a train?

262
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:58,254
- Why can't you drive?
- Where?

263
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:03,455
I don't know. Where am I goin'?
Wherever I'm goin'.

264
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,090
Gotta rent a car.

265
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:31,254
- See him pull a gun on me?
- Come on, he doesn't have a gun.

266
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,616
Car rental garages don't open
till morning.

267
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:37,628
Jesus.
Tough night, isn't it?

268
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:41,154
You want me to get in touch with Jan
after you're gone, tell her you're okay?

269
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:44,202
- Jan left me.
- She did?

270
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,261
- Yeah.
- I didn't know that.

271
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:49,205
Took the kid
and moved to her mother's.

272
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:53,871
Jesus Christ. That's terrible.

273
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:55,811
Yeah.

274
00:23:55,881 --> 00:24:00,215
I'll get her back.
If I live long enough.

275
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:07,957
- Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna put something on the box.

276
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:21,635
<i>There's a garden
What a garden</i>

277
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,608
- Second and South?
- Second and South.

278
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:27,145
- And South?
- Correct, yeah.

279
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:29,874
South is not in that direction, sir.
It's this direction, due north.

280
00:24:29,949 --> 00:24:33,385
<i>Sixth Street, next street is Seventh.
You got to go this direction.</i>

281
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,215
- Okay. Thanks.
- You're goin' the wrong way.

282
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:38,814
You go half a block east
and you're at Broadway...

283
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:49,032
- Have a drink. Aw, come on.
- No.

284
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:55,301
How much do I owe you?
Seventy? Keep it.

285
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:14,158
- How's Annie?
- Fine.

286
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:16,922
- Yeah?
- Fine, yeah.

287
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,989
She asks about you.

288
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:27,004
- How's the kid?
- Oh, the kid's terrific. Terrific.

289
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:31,031
- Kid's big as a truck.
- Yeah?

290
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,544
Beats up all the other kids
in the nursery school.

291
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,646
Beats up.
Must be tough.

292
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,651
He's enormous.

293
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:43,017
How's your kid?
Must be what?

294
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:46,615
- Five months now?
- She's five months, yeah. Got teeth.

295
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:49,183
- Really? That's something.
- Yeah.

296
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:54,528
- She's a terrific kid. Holds my thumb.
- That's cute.

297
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,536
- Who's she look like?
- Okay. Let's go. Come on.

298
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:00,595
- Where you going?
- Come on.

299
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:03,301
- Where you going?
- I wanna go to Jan's.

300
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:07,402
- Now?
- I wanna say good-bye.

301
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:10,209
I'd like to say good-bye
to the kid too.

302
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:12,250
They don't see you for a while,
they forget your face.

303
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:15,184
Nick, that's crazy.

304
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:17,916
- Come on. Let's go.
- Wait. Let me finish my beer.

305
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,452
Sure, buddy.

306
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,296
Go ahead. No hurry.

307
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,036
The hell with her.
Who needs her?

308
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,227
- Hot in here, huh?
- Yeah.

309
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:04,128
- You okay? Your stomach okay?
- Fine.

310
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:06,433
Eat some crackers.

311
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:24,112
Was that the phone?

312
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,256
I don't know.
You expecting a call?

313
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:33,531
What?

314
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,658
Nothing.

315
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:44,467
That would be funny, wouldn't it?
Some guy using a bar as an office.

316
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,354
I gotta get outta here.

317
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:03,985
Where you goin'?
Wait a minute.

318
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:05,757
- I'm goin'.
- I haven't finished my beer.

319
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:08,925
- You finish your beer. I'm goin'.
- I gotta call the car rental.

320
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:13,370
Wait a minute!
Nick, you're goin' crazy over...

321
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:11,891
- You're like a maniac.
- I couldn't breathe in there.

322
00:29:11,964 --> 00:29:13,693
All of a sudden jump up.
It's like a maniac.

323
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:15,357
No air in there.
You know that feeling?

324
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:18,062
- Goddamn it now.
- You don't have that feeling?

325
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:21,037
- I don't want to call you on this.
- That's a famous feeling.

326
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:25,065
I came over, you tell me
they're after you, I'm here.

327
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:28,579
I'll do what I can, everything.
Listen to me, for Christ's sake!

328
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:32,777
I'll do whatever I can,
but I cannot do it by myself.

329
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:34,785
- I gotta call the car now.
- Wanna go to a party?

330
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:37,686
I got a meetin'.

331
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:40,554
- Hey, I mean with a girl.
- What do you mean?

332
00:29:41,994 --> 00:29:44,189
What are you talking about?
Nick, don't be...

333
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:46,163
- Come on.
- What's the matter with you?

334
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:49,394
- I know a terrific girl.
- Where are you running to?

335
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:50,935
What the hell is
the matter with you?

336
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:53,528
- Got a terrific form.
- One girl, right?

337
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:56,073
Where does she live?
Where does she live. Is it far?

338
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:57,631
On Hall and Tenth Street!

339
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:01,871
Wait a minute.
What are you running? She'll wait.

340
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:04,381
- Do we have to run?
- Wanna go to a movie?

341
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:05,575
- What do you mean, a movie?
- I feel sick.

342
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:09,610
I don't want to be with a girl tonight.
I feel sick to my stomach.

343
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:14,455
- You don't wanna go to the girl.
- No. Go to a movie.

344
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,289
- Your stomach bothering you?
- Yeah.

345
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:18,488
Didn't I tell you to have something
to eat in the bar, goddamn you?

346
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:21,532
Here. Eat that.

347
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,831
I eat this? If I eat this,
do I go to the movie?

348
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:28,066
What movie? What movie are you
talkin' about? It's almost midnight.

349
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,200
- On 14th Street and Hall there's
- Put that in your mouth.

350
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:34,336
All-night movies, terrific shows,
double features

351
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:37,814
and they got cartoons, they have
15 minutes of coming attractions.

352
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:42,248
They got a candy counter
that's open all night long

353
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:45,188
and it's got ice cream sandwiches,
everything, the works.

354
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:49,159
Okay.
Let me call Annie first.

355
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:52,196
I told her I was gonna meet a guy,
have a drink, be home in an hour.

356
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:54,425
She's sitting up,
she's waiting for me.

357
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:59,163
So let me call her.
Where the hell is a phone?

358
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:03,674
- What are you going to tell her now?
- I'll think of something.

359
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:06,176
I don't treat my wife
the way you do.

360
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:12,205
If I'm gonna be late, or if
I'm gonna be out all night, I call.

361
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:20,053
What's the matter?
Is my face dirty?

362
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,855
You were sitting in that bar
for 45 minutes.

363
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:25,624
You never once thought
about calling your wife.

364
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:29,633
Never once thought
about calling Annie.

365
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:32,636
All of a sudden
you gotta call Annie.

366
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:38,835
I got a terrific suggestion
for you, Nick.

367
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,004
I suggest you find
somebody you can trust.

368
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:54,624
Hey, Mikey.

369
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:57,025
I didn't think of it.

370
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:02,789
How's that for a reason?

371
00:32:02,868 --> 00:32:06,167
- I had other things on my mind.
- I'm just asking a question.

372
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:08,331
I got my answer.

373
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:18,300
All right, I'm calling because I've been
delayed. I don't want you to worry.

374
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:23,837
I told Harry you'd be home to say
good night. Should I put him to bed?

375
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:26,247
Okay. Okay.

376
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:30,220
14th and... you mean Hall
like in "hallway"?

377
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:33,086
Hold on one minute.
I think I better write it down.

378
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:35,058
Harry, would you
bring me a crayon?

379
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:36,822
- Crayon?
- Crayola.

380
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:41,494
14th and Hall.

381
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:44,626
No, I don't have it.
Just a minute. Just a minute.

382
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:50,341
Would you bring me a book to write
on? Could I just borrow this?

383
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,244
I'm goin' to the bar.

384
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:04,019
- Who was that, Nick?
- A chick.

385
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:06,080
- Shirley.
- Shirley!

386
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:10,356
Shirley, here?

387
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:22,972
- Uh, you want gin and tonic.
- Gin and tonic, right.

388
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,204
I'll have a gin.

389
00:34:26,278 --> 00:34:28,405
- Just gin.
- Gin.

390
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:32,580
- Hey!
- Hi. How are ya?

391
00:34:32,651 --> 00:34:36,087
Mel, this is...
Wow, what is your name?

392
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:38,952
Is your name Mel?

393
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:43,723
My name is Mel.
What's your last name?

394
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,526
He gave me a dime.
I was gonna make a call.

395
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:48,566
His friend is in the booth.
He gave me a dime

396
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:49,998
- and he bought me a drink.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

397
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:54,232
- Hello. You gave her a dime, right?
- Yeah.

398
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:57,901
So I owe you a dime
'cause this is my old lady. Okay?

399
00:34:57,976 --> 00:35:01,104
What do you mean,
it's your old lady? She's not old.

400
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,371
Bye.

401
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:11,187
That ol' black man.

402
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:15,215
- Man, I thought you were a brother.
- Listen to me, now.

403
00:35:15,293 --> 00:35:19,320
Look in the phone booth.
Look in the phone booth.

404
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:23,356
Now, everybody in here knows you're
the man, so why don't you leave?

405
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:26,427
I mean, we might be black,
but we ain't dumb.

406
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:28,267
How come you're black?

407
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:34,140
- Mel.
- What did you say?

408
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:36,203
What did you just say?

409
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:40,308
Hey, Mel.

410
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:43,354
I'll talk to you later.

411
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:49,418
We don't want any trouble at all.
We just want to buy you a drink.

412
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,428
Can we buy you a drink?
Can we buy you a drink?

413
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:56,931
What the fuck are you doin'?

414
00:35:57,002 --> 00:35:59,664
All right, take it easy.
We're leaving.

415
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:02,263
Where you goin'?
What's the matter?

416
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,537
- I'm gonna finish my drink.
- Come on!

417
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,100
Come on!

418
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:28,764
You're a lunatic.
What are you trying to do, kill us?

419
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,597
Why don't you tie our feet together
and run in front of a truck?

420
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,434
What difference does it make?
I'm dead anyway.

421
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:36,667
- No one can hurt me.
- Shut up.

422
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:40,871
If everyone in that place beat me up,
it wouldn't hurt as much as dying.

423
00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:47,383
- I want to go to the movies.
- That's where we're gonna go.

424
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:28,917
Okay.

425
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:34,397
Uh, he's at the all-night movie
at 14th Street and Hall.

426
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:39,698
Movie, 14th and Hall.

427
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:43,835
<i>- Sixth Street!
- I wonder what's playing.</i>

428
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:50,544
Shoot.

429
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,381
Hey.

430
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:59,556
You all right?

431
00:37:59,624 --> 00:38:01,854
Yeah, sure.

432
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:08,156
Got a cigarette?

433
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,133
You're not supposed to smoke
on these things.

434
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,930
He gonna stop me,
this guy here?

435
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:14,767
Hey, take it easy.
Here's a cigarette.

436
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,808
Just one bus driver.

437
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:20,401
Save yourself for a crowd.

438
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:24,638
Excuse me.

439
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:28,277
- No smoking in the bus.
- Hey, shut up, will ya?

440
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:31,720
- I'm gonna tell the bus driver.
- I'm gonna tell your mother.

441
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,919
You know, I don't want to
start up with your element.

442
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:40,396
My element? Wait a minute.
Let me check it out.

443
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:42,160
Oh.

444
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:45,634
It's all right.
My element's okay.

445
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:48,536
Oh, dear.
Is that supposed to shock me?

446
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:50,972
- You know, you got big hands.
- What?

447
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:52,566
You got big hands.

448
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,510
You coulda been a piano player
with those hands.

449
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:04,619
Every good boy does fine
on his lines.

450
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:08,250
And then, F-A-C-E
in between the lines.

451
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:12,854
My sister played the piano.
She taught me a little bit.

452
00:39:12,931 --> 00:39:16,662
You remembered that.
That's terrific.

453
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:43,118
Eighth Street!

454
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:47,224
I owe you 200.

455
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:49,357
- What?
- 200.

456
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:58,532
You don't have to
give that to me now.

457
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,669
I'm loaded.
I don't need that now.

458
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:04,272
- I'll let you know if I need it.
- You okay?

459
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,077
I gotta send it to you later.

460
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:09,642
Tenth Street!

461
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:23,959
Twelfth Street!

462
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:27,630
Twelfth and Cottage... that's where
my mother's buried. That's where she is.

463
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:30,902
You were there. Weren't you there
when she was buried?

464
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:36,246
Of course I was there.
Don't you remember

465
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:40,011
I stayed up with you
for two weeks after she died?

466
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:44,944
- Getting off!
- What do you mean, we're getting off?

467
00:40:45,023 --> 00:40:47,389
Where are you going?
Wait a minute.

468
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,892
This is not the movie.

469
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,826
This isn't the movie.

470
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:54,057
Nick, this isn't the movie.

471
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:55,861
I wanna visit my mother's grave.

472
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:58,300
I haven't visited my mother
for a long time.

473
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:01,532
- Nick, listen.
- Wait. Getting off, 12th Street.

474
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:04,040
- Nick.
- I never even bought her a wreath.

475
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:05,905
I'll buy you a wreath.
I'll put it on for you.

476
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:08,844
It's past midnight.
The gates will be closed.

477
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:12,440
We'll climb over. When did we ever
use a gate to get into a cemetery?

478
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:15,543
What do you mean, "when did we ever"?
That sounds like we're cemetery freaks.

479
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,817
We busted into a cemetery
maybe twice in college.

480
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,085
12th Street.
Use the back exit, fellas.

481
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:25,653
- We wanna use the front door.
- Back exit. Company regulations.

482
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,393
He won't let the passenger on.
See this?

483
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:33,096
- All right. Nick.
- You see this? Wait a minute.

484
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:36,197
Don't you guys have a regulation
about letting passengers on?

485
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:39,710
Listen, I saw you sittin' back there
before smokin'. I didn't say a thing.

486
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:42,302
But I'll be goddamned if you're
gettin' out by the front door.

487
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,577
- Nick, look.
- Open the door, let the passengers on.

488
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,609
You got until I count to five to get out
the back door, then I'm takin' off.

489
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:51,780
- One, two, three
- Listen, Nick.

490
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:53,915
- It's 15 feet away.
- Four, five.

491
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:55,755
15 feet away.

492
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,658
Nick!

493
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:00,163
You open the door
and let the passengers on.

494
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:01,892
Screw you!

495
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:05,094
Open the door and let the
passengers on or I'll break your neck.

496
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:07,603
- Nick, this guy is enormous.
- You wanna fight?

497
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:09,833
Let me go.
I'll fight you!

498
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:12,307
I'm not leaving this bus
until you fight me.

499
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:14,311
They can fire me
for fighting on the bus.

500
00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:16,745
- Okay, we'll fight outside.
- Nick.

501
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:18,975
Okay, but we don't get out
through the front door.

502
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,349
Okay. You have my word on that, as long
as you let the passenger on first.

503
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,149
- That's fair.
- Okay.

504
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:26,053
- All right. Sit up.
- I trust this man

505
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:28,422
and he has my word of honor.

506
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:31,553
- All right.
- You got my word.

507
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:34,655
Go ahead. Then we'll go outside
and really have at it.

508
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:37,428
- Let's just open the door first.
- Go ahead. Open the door.

509
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:42,569
No, hold on there!
Hold on!

510
00:42:58,024 --> 00:43:00,015
I got you.

511
00:43:05,164 --> 00:43:07,155
I'm exhausted, really, Nick.

512
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:10,197
This is foolish.

513
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:11,429
- Shh.
- Nick.

514
00:43:11,504 --> 00:43:14,803
- Please. It's just foolish.
- Foolish.

515
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:19,834
- Frankly, I think it's ridiculous.
- You didn't like my mother.

516
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:23,439
I loved your mother.
I thought she was a wonderful woman.

517
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:26,542
Why is it ridiculous
to visit her grave?

518
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:29,520
- Because it's 1:00 in the morning.
- That makes it nicer.

519
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:33,081
That doesn't make it anything, Nick.
A grave is a grave.

520
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,389
There's not a religion in the world
that says a person's soul

521
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:37,486
is buried with them in their grave.

522
00:43:37,563 --> 00:43:40,623
- It's not your mother in there.
- You don't believe any of that stuff?

523
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,191
No.

524
00:43:44,804 --> 00:43:47,932
You don't believe
there's anything after you die.

525
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:53,667
Uh, me, personally, no.
I believe you die, and that's it.

526
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:55,270
And that doesn't scare you.

527
00:43:55,348 --> 00:44:00,342
To think that one day you'll die,
you'll be over.

528
00:44:02,054 --> 00:44:05,148
Won't be anything. You won't know
anything. There'll be nothing.

529
00:44:05,224 --> 00:44:08,057
Look, Nick, you wanna visit your mother?
Let's visit your mother

530
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:09,617
because the conversation is stupid.

531
00:44:09,695 --> 00:44:12,994
It isn't stupid, it's interesting
if you're gonna die.

532
00:44:13,065 --> 00:44:15,056
Well, I'm not gonna die,
so I think it's stupid.

533
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:17,898
- Yeah, well, you are someday.
- Look, Nick.

534
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,530
- You're gonna die someday.
- I'm not gonna stand here

535
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:25,566
till 1:00 in the morning and discuss
what's gonna happen to me when I die.

536
00:44:25,645 --> 00:44:28,910
<i>I mean, that mishegoss I leave
to the Catholics.</i>

537
00:44:28,981 --> 00:44:31,472
Aren't you gonna die someday?

538
00:44:35,822 --> 00:44:38,484
Aren't you gonna die someday?

539
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:46,129
- Aren't you gonna die someday?
- Nick, I'm not gonna...

540
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:48,292
All I want to know is,
are you gonna die someday?

541
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:53,327
Nick, you wanna visit your mother's
grave? Let's do that and get out.

542
00:44:53,406 --> 00:44:57,604
Give me your lighter. I wanna see
the names on those headstones.

543
00:44:57,677 --> 00:44:59,338
Here.

544
00:45:02,648 --> 00:45:05,014
Watch it.
There's a grave.

545
00:45:05,084 --> 00:45:08,383
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Grave.

546
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:15,394
Let me see this.

547
00:45:19,131 --> 00:45:21,691
- Where are you?
- Here.

548
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:27,105
Excuse me.

549
00:45:30,877 --> 00:45:34,643
"Born March 5th, 1863.

550
00:45:34,714 --> 00:45:39,151
Died January 28, 1930."
That's not it.

551
00:45:39,218 --> 00:45:42,710
Are we close, do you think?
Nick?

552
00:45:44,223 --> 00:45:46,248
- Look at this, will you?
- Nick, are we close?

553
00:45:46,325 --> 00:45:50,056
I don't know.
Gotta see some more names.

554
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:53,189
Is that how you find it? You memorized
the names on the headstones?

555
00:45:53,266 --> 00:45:56,064
<i>She's buried next to
a whole family of Irishmen.</i>

556
00:45:56,135 --> 00:45:58,831
It's a Catholic cemetery, Nick.
It's full of Irishmen.

557
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:00,395
Hey, look. You don't want
to come with me?

558
00:46:00,473 --> 00:46:02,304
Let's just forget about it.
I'll go alone.

559
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:06,869
Oh, sure, I climbed the wall and
I don't know where the hell I am...

560
00:46:06,946 --> 00:46:09,574
excuse me...
you're gonna go alone!

561
00:46:09,649 --> 00:46:11,844
Who do you keep saying
"excuse me" to?

562
00:46:11,918 --> 00:46:14,443
Oh, did I make a mistake.
Excuse me.

563
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,956
You didn't make a mistake.
This is a good thing to do.

564
00:46:18,024 --> 00:46:20,618
- Hey, Ma!
- I'm gonna hit you!

565
00:46:20,693 --> 00:46:23,025
What for? You're afraid
I'm gonna wake somebody up?

566
00:46:23,095 --> 00:46:25,393
Do you know the difference
between not believing in something

567
00:46:25,464 --> 00:46:27,091
and having a little respect for it?

568
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:29,600
- Hey, Ma! Where are you?
- I'm going.

569
00:46:29,669 --> 00:46:31,159
Hey, Ma, where are you?

570
00:46:31,237 --> 00:46:34,638
- All right. I'm going. I'm goin', Nick.
- Hey, Ma! I'm here!

571
00:46:34,707 --> 00:46:36,334
- I'm goin'.
- Hey, Ma!

572
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:40,605
Ma, if anything happens to me,
Mikey did it.

573
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,114
Hey! Take that back!

574
00:46:43,182 --> 00:46:45,241
Oh, are you still here?
I thought you left.

575
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:48,082
You son of a bitch!
Take it back!

576
00:46:48,154 --> 00:46:52,523
Okay, Ma, I take it back.
You'll find out for yourself anyway.

577
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:58,830
- Listen, Nick.
- Hi.

578
00:46:58,898 --> 00:47:01,128
All right, listen.
Let's not fool around anymore.

579
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,725
- I'm not fooling around.
- Listen to me.

580
00:47:03,803 --> 00:47:07,603
This is a very big park,
and I'm sure you'll agree with me

581
00:47:07,673 --> 00:47:10,471
- if we look through every headstone...
- Here.

582
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:13,034
Right here.

583
00:47:29,328 --> 00:47:31,819
Hey, Mike, you know what?

584
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:40,561
Now that I'm here,
I don't know what to do.

585
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:43,468
Don't do that.

586
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:48,341
My ma doesn't mind me laughing.
Do you, Ma?

587
00:47:48,414 --> 00:47:51,042
- Stop it, Nick.
- Just talking to my mother.

588
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:54,177
You don't have to talk
out loud to her.

589
00:47:54,253 --> 00:47:57,882
Uh. Well

590
00:47:57,957 --> 00:48:00,255
I don't know what to do.

591
00:48:06,165 --> 00:48:08,565
This is tough, man. This is hard.

592
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:13,196
It's very hard to talk to a dead person.
I have nothing in common.

593
00:48:19,845 --> 00:48:23,474
Hi, Ma.

594
00:48:26,452 --> 00:48:29,216
Nick, you're making me
forget the Kaddish.

595
00:48:29,288 --> 00:48:33,281
Ma... I'm sorry, Mikey.

596
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,884
Ma...

597
00:48:35,961 --> 00:48:39,419
I don't want to die, Ma.

598
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:44,568
I'm talking to my mother here.

599
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:52,777
- Hey, Mikey.
- I'm trying to remember the Kaddish.

600
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:58,374
Wouldn't it be great...

601
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:00,783
I was just gonna say,
wouldn't it be great if she was alive?

602
00:49:03,322 --> 00:49:05,950
Don't you wish
your mother was alive?

603
00:49:06,025 --> 00:49:09,927
Of course I wish
my mother was alive.

604
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:13,692
I think that's the reason
we're such good friends.

605
00:49:13,766 --> 00:49:16,894
Because we remember each other
from when we were kids.

606
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:20,598
Things that happened when we were
kids that no one knows about but us.

607
00:49:20,673 --> 00:49:24,939
It's in our heads.
That's how we know they really happened.

608
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:29,344
What are you talking about? I know
what really happened when I was a kid.

609
00:49:29,415 --> 00:49:31,076
Yeah, but no one else does.

610
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:34,711
I mean, everyone we knew
when we were kids is dead.

611
00:49:34,787 --> 00:49:38,587
So what?
I still remember what happened.

612
00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:42,149
And I tell Annie about a lot of things
that happened when I was a kid.

613
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:45,129
And she enjoys listening to that.

614
00:49:45,197 --> 00:49:49,531
- Well, you don't know what I mean.
- Oh, of course not, 'cause I'm stupid.

615
00:49:49,602 --> 00:49:53,231
No, I wish...

616
00:49:53,305 --> 00:49:58,242
I wish my mother was alive.
I wish your mother was alive.

617
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:02,940
And I wish your father was alive,
and I wish my father was alive.

618
00:50:03,015 --> 00:50:07,145
And I wish your brother,
Izzy, was alive.

619
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,218
- Did you know my brother, Izzy?
- Sure.

620
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,882
God, don't you remember?

621
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:16,985
I mean, he lost all his hair.
And then

622
00:50:17,062 --> 00:50:19,690
<i>we called him "baldy."
And the next day he died.</i>

623
00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:24,793
Then we went to the grave
and we apologized.

624
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:28,203
He was ten years old,
God rest his soul.

625
00:50:29,475 --> 00:50:31,466
My poor brother.

626
00:50:35,815 --> 00:50:39,273
Oh, this is terrible.

627
00:50:40,886 --> 00:50:43,650
Come on. Let's go.

628
00:50:43,722 --> 00:50:47,021
I think it's this way.

629
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:49,788
Oh, excuse me.
That's a grave.

630
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:54,265
- Watch the headstones.
- Okay. Excuse me.

631
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:57,268
- Thank God you're here.
- Whoo.

632
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:04,738
You son of a bitch.

633
00:51:12,084 --> 00:51:14,177
Oh, you son of a bitch.

634
00:51:32,104 --> 00:51:35,631
...now five.
You got three and four.

635
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:40,407
What's the difference?

636
00:51:43,148 --> 00:51:46,948
Yeah. Yeah.

637
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:49,317
Yeah, explain it to me.

638
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:53,083
I been an hour.
They're just not gonna show up.

639
00:51:53,158 --> 00:51:55,285
They're not gonna show.

640
00:51:57,463 --> 00:52:02,594
What, did you go... did you go
inside the theater? Warren.

641
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:09,671
I said, didn't you go
inside the theater?

642
00:52:09,742 --> 00:52:12,575
No, I don't see what you mean, no.

643
00:52:12,645 --> 00:52:16,172
What do you think they're planning...
to shoot you at a movie house?

644
00:52:16,248 --> 00:52:19,445
If they were planning something,
that wouldn't be in a theater.

645
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,885
Warren. Warren!

646
00:52:24,957 --> 00:52:29,223
Now, I want you to
do me a favor.

647
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:31,160
Don't do the job.

648
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:39,264
Look, I don't want to have
a misunderstanding with you.

649
00:52:39,338 --> 00:52:43,035
I know I need a sale,
and I'm...

650
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:47,135
All right. I'm gonna check it out
right now. Is that all right?

651
00:52:47,212 --> 00:52:49,203
Yeah.

652
00:52:52,284 --> 00:52:58,382
That moron's got one idea in his head:
They're screwing me. That's all.

653
00:52:58,457 --> 00:53:02,518
You know they're all paranoiac,
these guys.

654
00:53:02,594 --> 00:53:05,427
Yeah, maybe.

655
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:09,900
But if they're not in the theater,
he may be right.

656
00:53:36,095 --> 00:53:39,155
May I help you find a seat, sir?

657
00:53:39,231 --> 00:53:41,791
No, that's okay.

658
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:44,097
I can find one.

659
00:53:51,043 --> 00:53:52,874
Hit you.

660
00:53:57,149 --> 00:53:59,447
How far you gonna drive me?

661
00:53:59,518 --> 00:54:03,079
We gotta drive to a city
where there's an airport

662
00:54:03,155 --> 00:54:05,419
and take a plane out.

663
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:07,982
- "We"?
- We.

664
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,029
- You're goin' with me?
- Yeah.

665
00:54:11,096 --> 00:54:15,157
Yeah, you son of a bitch.
I'm comin' with you.

666
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:19,261
Won't I get you in bad with Resnick,
disappearing like that?

667
00:54:19,338 --> 00:54:22,774
Don't you think you ought to make
some excuse to him for leaving?

668
00:54:22,841 --> 00:54:26,834
- These guys don't like to look bad.
- Fuck 'em.

669
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,076
It's my wife I'm thinkin'.

670
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:33,482
And my kid.

671
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:39,489
You wanna go to the girl?

672
00:54:42,628 --> 00:54:45,688
Boob and Tenth?

673
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:17,420
Oh! Oh! Baby!

674
00:55:24,636 --> 00:55:27,696
Go to the safe deposit box,
take out $4,000.

675
00:55:27,773 --> 00:55:31,140
Right. Mikey

676
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,644
Harry's up.
He's not sick, and he's up.

677
00:55:33,712 --> 00:55:35,475
This is like the third time he's up.

678
00:55:35,547 --> 00:55:39,005
I'm glad to see you again.

679
00:55:39,084 --> 00:55:41,382
Oh, yes, very.
Are you kidding me?

680
00:55:41,453 --> 00:55:44,889
I bet you're glad to see me.

681
00:55:47,426 --> 00:55:50,156
Oh, heavens above.

682
00:55:50,229 --> 00:55:53,596
I don't like that, Nicky.
You know I don't like that.

683
00:55:55,234 --> 00:55:58,931
- It's a joke.
- I don't like that kind of joke.

684
00:56:01,773 --> 00:56:04,241
All right. I gotta run.
I gotta run.

685
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:07,767
- Yeah.
- What's up?

686
00:56:07,846 --> 00:56:09,837
I love you, darling.

687
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,448
- The kid's sick.
- No kidding? That's terrible.

688
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,249
- A cold?
- No kidding?

689
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:18,050
Yeah, it's just a cold.

690
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:21,923
That light's gonna give me a headache.
It give you a headache? Yeah.

691
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:24,189
- Got plenty of light from the street.
- No. Please don't do that.

692
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,533
- Maybe the flu?
- Huh? No. A little chest cold.

693
00:56:33,605 --> 00:56:37,974
Um, how old is
your little baby?

694
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:40,068
Five.

695
00:56:40,145 --> 00:56:43,046
<i>Baby? Come sit next to me.</i>

696
00:56:43,115 --> 00:56:46,084
- A boy?
- Yeah, that's right.

697
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:49,746
- That's nice. What's his name?
- Harry.

698
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:56,889
She's not asking you what he
looks like, she's asking his name.

699
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:04,499
What's the joke?

700
00:57:07,272 --> 00:57:11,971
<i>...denouncing what it called renewed
United States military intervention</i>

701
00:57:12,044 --> 00:57:13,636
<i>in Southeast Asia.</i>

702
00:57:13,712 --> 00:57:15,145
You have a record player?

703
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:18,115
- I'd like to hear some music.
- I just want to hear this.

704
00:57:18,183 --> 00:57:21,311
I'm very interested to see
what happens in Indochina.

705
00:57:21,386 --> 00:57:23,581
- Yeah?
- Oh, yes.

706
00:57:23,655 --> 00:57:25,555
Really? No kidding.

707
00:57:27,326 --> 00:57:30,523
- Please don't. I asked you.
- So, you follow the news, huh?

708
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:34,464
- As much as I can.
- Do ya?

709
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:36,330
Yeah.

710
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:41,031
I like to know as much as I can.
Please don't.

711
00:57:41,106 --> 00:57:43,574
What am I doing?
I'm not doing anything.

712
00:57:43,642 --> 00:57:46,338
I'm just sitting here.
Am I doing anything?

713
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:49,175
- Do you read a lot?
- No, I don't.

714
00:57:52,217 --> 00:57:55,448
I'm talking to the lady.

715
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,681
Tell him about
how many books you read.

716
00:57:57,756 --> 00:58:01,123
- She reads plenty.
- Why do you keep answering?

717
00:58:01,193 --> 00:58:02,956
Didn't I ask Nell that question?

718
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,462
I read.

719
00:58:07,532 --> 00:58:09,659
- I read.
- Kiss me, will you?

720
00:58:09,735 --> 00:58:12,260
- Oh, stop it.
- Kiss me, will you, please?

721
00:58:12,337 --> 00:58:14,362
I mean it now.
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

722
00:58:14,439 --> 00:58:18,170
- So, you read a lot?
- Nicky! Oh, please, stop it, Nicky.

723
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:21,235
- What am I doing here?
- Why do you treat me like this?

724
00:58:21,313 --> 00:58:23,008
I'm not treating you badly.

725
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:27,484
- I'll be absolutely behaved.
- Stop it, Nicky.

726
00:58:27,552 --> 00:58:31,921
I wanted you, sweetheart.
Don't push me away, darling.

727
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,958
- Stop it.
- No, don't. Come on.

728
00:58:34,026 --> 00:58:37,723
Don't you have any respect for me?

729
00:58:37,796 --> 00:58:40,264
Sure, I do.
I have plenty of respect for you.

730
00:58:40,332 --> 00:58:44,428
But you make it so hard for me
because I like you.

731
00:58:44,503 --> 00:58:48,064
I don't know if it's such a good thing
that we start fooling around with China.

732
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,768
They got the biggest army
in the world, those Chinese.

733
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:54,869
- Please, Nick.
- Will you kiss me? Huh?

734
00:58:54,946 --> 00:58:57,244
I asked you not to
in front of him.

735
00:58:57,316 --> 00:59:00,217
- Biggest presence...
- Forget about him.

736
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:09,394
- Oh, stop!
- Bullshit.

737
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:12,589
To hell with this.
This is...

738
00:59:18,937 --> 00:59:20,928
Nicky.

739
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:26,907
Oh, God.

740
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,751
I love you.

741
00:59:41,626 --> 00:59:43,287
I love you.

742
00:59:45,797 --> 00:59:48,231
- L...
- I love you, Nell.

743
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,734
I love you.

744
00:59:50,802 --> 00:59:52,963
I love you so much
it's unbelievable.

745
00:59:53,038 --> 00:59:56,030
Nicky, I love you so much.

746
00:59:56,108 --> 00:59:59,271
Oh, oh, Nicky.

747
00:59:59,344 --> 01:00:03,644
Nicky, you shouldn't do that.
I asked you, please.

748
01:00:03,715 --> 01:00:05,444
I love you.

749
01:00:05,517 --> 01:00:07,508
- Nicky.
- I love you.

750
01:00:07,586 --> 01:00:09,781
- Please.
- What is it, sweetheart?

751
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:14,053
- Pull down the shade first.
- Of course.

752
01:00:34,913 --> 01:00:37,404
Oh, Nicky.

753
01:00:37,482 --> 01:00:39,814
Tell me that you love me.

754
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:41,785
Oh, I love you.
I love you.

755
01:00:48,393 --> 01:00:50,293
I love you, darling.

756
01:00:50,362 --> 01:00:53,092
I love you, sweetheart.

757
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:57,033
I love you.
Just take it slow.

758
01:01:02,407 --> 01:01:04,671
You're so sweet, baby.

759
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:12,716
Baby. Oh, sweetheart.
I love you.

760
01:01:18,323 --> 01:01:21,053
Just relax, now,
just let me...

761
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:24,721
- Come on, babe.
- Nicky.

762
01:01:24,796 --> 01:01:26,787
I love you, baby.

763
01:01:33,038 --> 01:01:35,768
Oh, God.

764
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:38,241
Oh, I love you, darling.

765
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:40,107
Say it.

766
01:01:40,178 --> 01:01:41,941
I love you.

767
01:01:44,082 --> 01:01:47,108
I love you.
There's no one else here.

768
01:01:47,185 --> 01:01:50,416
- It's just you and me.
- Oh, I love you.

769
01:01:51,256 --> 01:01:54,692
Just you and me.
You understand?

770
01:01:54,759 --> 01:01:57,023
Yeah.

771
01:01:57,095 --> 01:02:01,156
All right. It's all right.
Come on now.

772
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:04,430
Oh. Oh, God.

773
01:02:07,606 --> 01:02:11,736
Oh, I can't help it, darling.
Yes, yes.

774
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,801
- No. No.
- Yes, yes.

775
01:02:13,879 --> 01:02:17,315
- Tell me that you love me.
- I love you, darling.

776
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:23,009
I love you. I love you.
Do you understand?

777
01:02:23,088 --> 01:02:26,023
- Say you understand me.
- Mm-hm.

778
01:02:26,091 --> 01:02:29,891
I love you, darling.
Do you really understand?

779
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:34,591
Don't cry, sweetie.
Please don't cry.

780
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:38,534
I don't like to see you cry.

781
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:43,202
- Nick? Nick?
- Oh!

782
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:46,438
- Goddamn, yeah.
- Nicky?

783
01:02:46,511 --> 01:02:50,106
I love you. I really love you.
Oh, goddamn.

784
01:02:51,816 --> 01:02:55,013
Oh, my God.
Oh, Jesus.

785
01:03:04,663 --> 01:03:07,723
- How do you feel? Want a cigarette?
- Yes.

786
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:12,393
Let me go in there
and talk to him a minute.

787
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:16,196
See if I can get rid of him.

788
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:21,374
Just get my...

789
01:03:26,985 --> 01:03:29,112
Hey, you got a light?

790
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:37,285
What the hell...
What are you doing?

791
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:40,422
I'm sorry. What's the matter?

792
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:43,023
I wanted to warm her up
a little bit for you.

793
01:03:43,101 --> 01:03:46,264
Forget you. Let's go.

794
01:03:46,338 --> 01:03:49,239
I got mine.

795
01:03:49,307 --> 01:03:51,366
Good.

796
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:55,246
What's the matter?
Why are you...

797
01:03:55,313 --> 01:03:57,474
What... are you mad I went first?

798
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:02,318
She likes you.

799
01:04:04,422 --> 01:04:07,482
- She likes you.
- She likes me?

800
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:12,587
- She won't do anything for me.
- Sure, she likes me. She likes you.

801
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:16,623
She likes everybody.
I heard that from 20 guys.

802
01:04:16,701 --> 01:04:20,102
You go ahead.

803
01:04:20,171 --> 01:04:25,734
Don't take any bullshit. Put her down
on the couch and tell her what do do.

804
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,471
Go ahead.

805
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,909
Go ahead.

806
01:04:58,877 --> 01:05:02,176
So, you like the news, huh?

807
01:05:02,247 --> 01:05:05,410
I like to know what's happening.

808
01:05:16,528 --> 01:05:19,156
You know, that's...

809
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,221
that's unusual.

810
01:05:23,668 --> 01:05:26,831
Because you know that, uh

811
01:05:26,905 --> 01:05:30,033
most pretty girls

812
01:05:30,108 --> 01:05:32,167
they don't have
a brain in their head.

813
01:05:33,745 --> 01:05:37,681
I mean, most pretty girls,
they don't care about, uh

814
01:05:37,749 --> 01:05:39,842
anything that's happening
around them

815
01:05:39,918 --> 01:05:43,115
except that they want to have
a good time.

816
01:05:44,756 --> 01:05:46,690
Isn't it so?

817
01:05:49,227 --> 01:05:51,593
Yes, l...

818
01:05:51,663 --> 01:05:54,962
I guess most girls are pretty dumb.

819
01:05:57,235 --> 01:06:00,966
It makes it nice when they're
smart and pretty.

820
01:06:02,707 --> 01:06:04,538
Thank you.

821
01:06:12,984 --> 01:06:16,579
Mikey, please.

822
01:06:16,654 --> 01:06:20,852
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Mikey, please.

823
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:23,120
Don't get fresh.

824
01:06:23,194 --> 01:06:25,424
No.

825
01:06:25,497 --> 01:06:28,261
I just want a little kiss.

826
01:06:30,335 --> 01:06:32,633
Mikey, please. Mikey.

827
01:06:32,704 --> 01:06:36,105
- Come here, darling.
- Mikey, please, don't.

828
01:06:37,976 --> 01:06:40,968
Get out of here! Ow!

829
01:06:41,045 --> 01:06:43,104
Get your coat and get out!

830
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:47,083
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's goin' on?

831
01:06:47,152 --> 01:06:51,213
- Get your coat and get out of here!
- What'd she do?

832
01:06:51,289 --> 01:06:53,484
- She bit your lip?
- Get out of here!

833
01:06:53,558 --> 01:06:55,685
Give this man a handkerchief.
His lip is bleeding.

834
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,819
Get out of here!
Get out of here.

835
01:06:57,896 --> 01:07:00,490
Look, a lot of the boys say
you're a nice girl.

836
01:07:00,565 --> 01:07:04,092
Now, that's not very nice, Nellie.
That's not nice.

837
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:06,433
Get out! You liar!

838
01:07:06,504 --> 01:07:10,998
I have to call down to the boys
and tell them that you're gettin' mean.

839
01:07:11,075 --> 01:07:15,171
You liar! I never...
You liar!

840
01:07:15,246 --> 01:07:19,012
- I'm goin'.
- I never...

841
01:07:22,687 --> 01:07:26,179
- Mike? What's the matter?
- Fuck off, will ya?

842
01:07:26,257 --> 01:07:29,556
You're mad. Come on.
Don't be mad at me.

843
01:07:29,627 --> 01:07:33,859
You've got all the friends,
and you've got all the money.

844
01:07:33,932 --> 01:07:36,298
Did you have to do that to me
in front of some dumb bitch

845
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:40,895
- to prove you got all the women?
- I didn't know that was gonna happen.

846
01:07:40,972 --> 01:07:42,906
Honest to God.
She screws anyone.

847
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:45,169
But me.

848
01:07:45,243 --> 01:07:47,040
Everybody but me.

849
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:51,047
Is that my fault? Don't get mad at me
'cause some dumb hooker turned you down.

850
01:07:51,115 --> 01:07:53,948
She's your girl. She's not a hooker.
You don't pay for that.

851
01:07:54,018 --> 01:07:58,648
Mikey, she's a psycho.
You gotta tell her you love her.

852
01:07:58,723 --> 01:08:02,056
You give her a few bucks,
you tell her it's a present.

853
01:08:02,126 --> 01:08:04,424
- It would be interesting for you.
- Bullshit.

854
01:08:04,495 --> 01:08:08,363
- You knew what would happen.
- Honest to God, Mikey, I didn't.

855
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:11,630
I wouldn't do anything
to hurt you on purpose.

856
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:14,866
I wouldn't do anything
to make you look bad.

857
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:17,965
You're like my family.
I love you. Hey.

858
01:08:19,244 --> 01:08:22,236
I think you'd make your family
look bad on purpose.

859
01:08:22,313 --> 01:08:24,474
'Cause I don't think
you love anyone but you.

860
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:27,747
Glad to know
what you think of me.

861
01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:31,949
Good.
Because I'm glad I told you.

862
01:08:32,023 --> 01:08:36,255
Now, here's your gun.
Give me my watch.

863
01:08:38,363 --> 01:08:41,924
- Give me my watch.
- No.

864
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,160
Give me my watch.

865
01:08:43,234 --> 01:08:46,761
- I want my watch.
- Here's your watch. There's your watch.

866
01:08:49,374 --> 01:08:51,604
You prick.

867
01:08:58,616 --> 01:09:01,380
Is it broken, your watch?

868
01:09:04,122 --> 01:09:05,953
Is it broken?

869
01:09:07,058 --> 01:09:09,219
Son of a bitch.

870
01:09:10,528 --> 01:09:12,496
My father gave me this watch.

871
01:09:12,563 --> 01:09:16,522
- Give it to me. I'll see if I can...
- Get away. Get away.

872
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:19,695
Give it to me. I think I know a guy
who can put it together again.

873
01:09:19,771 --> 01:09:23,935
- He's a watch expert. Here.
- The winding stem is gone.

874
01:09:24,008 --> 01:09:26,374
Winding stem is gone.

875
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,841
- Let's see.
- Look at this. Look what you did.

876
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:36,216
I'm sorry.
You don't have the time, do you?

877
01:09:36,287 --> 01:09:39,916
You think this is a joke?

878
01:09:40,892 --> 01:09:42,951
- This is funny to you.
- No.

879
01:09:43,027 --> 01:09:45,154
- I had the watch 20 years.
- Oh.

880
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:47,629
- Yes.
- That's long enough.

881
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:52,159
What's this? Is this the winding stem
here, this thing? Is that it?

882
01:09:54,706 --> 01:09:56,833
I think it's one of the hands.

883
01:09:56,908 --> 01:09:59,206
The hands?
One of the hands?

884
01:09:59,277 --> 01:10:02,178
Jesus Christ, there's nothing left
of this watch.

885
01:10:05,116 --> 01:10:10,315
You know... you know there's
really something wrong with you.

886
01:10:10,388 --> 01:10:14,085
Don't you have any notion of anything
that goes on outside of your own head?

887
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:16,956
Don't you have any idea
how people feel?

888
01:10:17,028 --> 01:10:20,464
Can't you understand
that my father gave me this watch?

889
01:10:20,531 --> 01:10:23,125
It's the only thing I have
from my father.

890
01:10:23,201 --> 01:10:25,260
So, what do you want?
You want another one?

891
01:10:25,336 --> 01:10:27,998
- Forget it. I'm goin'.
- Hey, Mike.

892
01:10:28,072 --> 01:10:30,836
- I'm sorry about the watch.
- Take your gun.

893
01:10:30,908 --> 01:10:34,844
And I'm sorry about the girl too.
What else you want me to say?

894
01:10:36,547 --> 01:10:40,108
Nothin'.
I don't want you to say anything.

895
01:10:40,184 --> 01:10:43,745
- I just don't want to do it anymore.
- What?

896
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:46,813
- Be your friend.
- Then I'll be your friend.

897
01:10:46,891 --> 01:10:48,381
Huh-uh.

898
01:10:50,161 --> 01:10:54,860
No, you'll be my friend
when you're not in trouble.

899
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:01,033
See, I don't want you to be my friend
just when there's nobody else around.

900
01:11:01,105 --> 01:11:04,302
What are you talking about? I'm your
friend when other people are around.

901
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:07,902
No, you're not. You don't know
who I am when other people are around.

902
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:11,107
I spoke to you maybe five times
since you met Dave Resnick.

903
01:11:11,182 --> 01:11:14,879
I introduced you,
I got you the job

904
01:11:14,952 --> 01:11:17,079
and now I can't get you
on the phone.

905
01:11:17,155 --> 01:11:19,282
What are you talking about?

906
01:11:19,357 --> 01:11:23,020
Hey, what are you talking about?

907
01:11:23,094 --> 01:11:26,586
- Are you crazy?
- I call, and you never call me back!

908
01:11:26,664 --> 01:11:30,464
You don't call me. You haven't
called me in months.

909
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:35,768
Yeah, because after three months you
don't call back, I don't call anymore.

910
01:11:37,408 --> 01:11:39,603
Hey, you don't even
say hello to me.

911
01:11:42,246 --> 01:11:45,704
I walk into that restaurant, you're
sitting with Dave Resnick and Sid Fine

912
01:11:45,783 --> 01:11:49,879
and I gotta say hello to you three times
and you don't answer

913
01:11:49,954 --> 01:11:52,889
and when I walk away
I hear you say

914
01:11:52,957 --> 01:11:57,189
"Jesus Christ! Call that guy back.
I forgot to give him the order."

915
01:11:57,261 --> 01:11:59,786
- That was a joke.
- That joke was for Resnick.

916
01:11:59,864 --> 01:12:03,561
For you, not for Resnick.

917
01:12:03,634 --> 01:12:06,194
That's why I said it loud enough
for you to hear it.

918
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:11,207
That was a joke for you.

919
01:12:11,275 --> 01:12:13,903
You call me "The Echo."

920
01:12:15,947 --> 01:12:20,384
And you tell everybody
that I have to say everything twice

921
01:12:20,451 --> 01:12:23,682
because I got a tunnel in my head.

922
01:12:25,389 --> 01:12:27,380
The second time is the echo.

923
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:32,395
Mikey, everybody says everything.
I mean, what's the difference?

924
01:12:32,463 --> 01:12:36,297
I was kidding.
Don't you ever kid?

925
01:12:38,503 --> 01:12:41,301
You make me out a joke
to Resnick.

926
01:12:44,475 --> 01:12:46,841
Just like you made me out
a joke to that girl.

927
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:48,902
Mikey, you're wrong.

928
01:12:51,415 --> 01:12:56,148
And I'd do anything for you.
Anything.

929
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:02,489
And unless you're sick or in trouble,
you don't even know I'm alive.

930
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,221
And now look what you did.

931
01:13:04,295 --> 01:13:08,755
Now you called me, now I came, and
look what you did, and for no reason.

932
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:11,768
No fuckin' reason!
Bullshit!

933
01:13:11,836 --> 01:13:14,532
Go find yourself another friend!

934
01:13:14,605 --> 01:13:17,972
You're wrong!
Really. Mike?

935
01:13:19,243 --> 01:13:21,575
Hey, Mike. Hey, Mikey.

936
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:25,374
Jesus Christ, come on.

937
01:13:25,449 --> 01:13:28,316
Hey, Mike.
Hey, I'm sorry.

938
01:13:28,386 --> 01:13:30,650
I'm sorry. Honest to God.
You were wrong.

939
01:13:30,721 --> 01:13:32,586
I wouldn't do anything bad to you.

940
01:13:32,657 --> 01:13:35,387
I love you, Mike.

941
01:13:35,459 --> 01:13:37,484
Please don't walk out on me.

942
01:13:37,562 --> 01:13:39,530
Mikey?

943
01:13:40,698 --> 01:13:44,293
Please.
Please don't walk out on me.

944
01:13:45,336 --> 01:13:47,463
Please don't walk out on me.

945
01:13:50,274 --> 01:13:51,798
Mike?

946
01:13:59,383 --> 01:14:01,180
Screw you.

947
01:14:02,253 --> 01:14:06,849
You wanna walk?
Hey, walk.

948
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:10,451
You got a good excuse now
not to come with me, right?

949
01:14:10,528 --> 01:14:13,122
'Cause I call you
"The Echo," right?

950
01:14:13,197 --> 01:14:16,462
That's bullshit.
I know what you're doin'.

951
01:14:16,534 --> 01:14:19,799
So screw you!
I tell you, screw you!

952
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:24,864
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

953
01:14:26,244 --> 01:14:28,269
Is that right?

954
01:14:28,346 --> 01:14:32,715
What am I supposed to do?
Carry you around in my pocket, Mikey?

955
01:14:32,783 --> 01:14:36,446
I can't help it I'm not home
when the phone rings.

956
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,751
I'm a plenty good friend of yours.
Mikey, look, come on, will ya?

957
01:14:39,824 --> 01:14:42,918
What other friends have you got?

958
01:14:42,994 --> 01:14:44,586
Hey, Mike.

959
01:14:45,596 --> 01:14:49,157
Oh, I'm a Yankee Doodle.
Hey, Mike.

960
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:53,900
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that...

961
01:14:53,971 --> 01:14:55,632
Let me just talk to you
a minute, will ya?

962
01:14:55,706 --> 01:14:59,073
I'm sorry Resnick doesn't take you
to all the restaurants.

963
01:14:59,143 --> 01:15:02,579
I don't ask him not to.
Look, I swear to you.

964
01:15:02,647 --> 01:15:05,377
He doesn't like you.
You get on his nerves.

965
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:08,545
I'm the one that stood up for you.

966
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:12,453
I'm the one that asked you
to come into the bank, Mike.

967
01:15:12,523 --> 01:15:18,018
Look, with all this crap about how much
you do for me, what you give me...

968
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:21,790
I'm the one that lent you
$200 when you needed it.

969
01:15:21,866 --> 01:15:24,926
I don't remember you
doing shit for me.

970
01:15:32,543 --> 01:15:35,137
You're a piece of nothin'.

971
01:16:59,997 --> 01:17:01,760
Warren Kinney?

972
01:17:05,269 --> 01:17:06,759
Warren Kinney.

973
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,471
I just lost the guy,
about five or six blocks...

974
01:17:12,543 --> 01:17:14,841
I want you to come around
the other side of the car.

975
01:17:16,313 --> 01:17:18,838
Guy beat the shit out of him.

976
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:22,111
- Okay, come on. Get in.
- We were on Tenth

977
01:17:22,186 --> 01:17:25,178
about five blocks from here,
we had a fight.

978
01:17:27,024 --> 01:17:32,291
He busted my watch.
My father's watch, he busted it.

979
01:17:32,363 --> 01:17:35,821
It's the only thing I got
from my father.

980
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,391
He threw it in the street
and he busted it.

981
01:17:38,469 --> 01:17:41,370
What did he do that for?

982
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:45,705
Because he's crazy,
and a prick.

983
01:17:48,512 --> 01:17:51,379
Let's go after the guy.

984
01:18:18,309 --> 01:18:20,834
Take a right on Hall.

985
01:18:24,782 --> 01:18:28,047
Why don't you tell me where we're goin'?
I can read the street signs.

986
01:18:28,118 --> 01:18:31,144
Back on the beat,
same spot I left him.

987
01:18:31,222 --> 01:18:33,747
I said he was around here.

988
01:18:33,824 --> 01:18:37,123
I didn't say he was standing in the
middle of the street waiting for us.

989
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:04,913
I should have had a driver
on this, damn it.

990
01:19:05,923 --> 01:19:07,720
Every place I've been tonight,
I couldn't park.

991
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:10,123
There's a "No Parking" sign
every time I turn around.

992
01:19:10,194 --> 01:19:12,924
Make a right.

993
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:17,696
Finally ended up... I waited in a
no parking zone for you all night long.

994
01:19:17,768 --> 01:19:21,636
- You should have taken a driver.
- Oh, Jesus.

995
01:19:21,705 --> 01:19:25,266
I take a driver,
I gotta pay him a buck too.

996
01:19:25,342 --> 01:19:27,606
Shouldn't have needed a driver
on this.

997
01:19:48,933 --> 01:19:51,197
Make a left here.

998
01:19:54,605 --> 01:19:56,630
Is that him?

999
01:19:58,409 --> 01:20:00,400
No.

1000
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,871
Hey, you sure?

1001
01:20:06,684 --> 01:20:10,620
Yes, I'm sure.
You wanna shoot him just in case?

1002
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:15,120
What's the matter?
I just asked you a question.

1003
01:20:15,192 --> 01:20:19,595
Well, for Christ's sakes, if I say
it's not him, I ought to know.

1004
01:20:19,663 --> 01:20:21,995
Yeah, you ought to know.

1005
01:20:27,905 --> 01:20:30,840
Honey?

1006
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:35,743
- Go to bed. I'll be in.
- Honey. Sweetheart.

1007
01:20:35,813 --> 01:20:38,543
- Let me in?
- I told you not to come here.

1008
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:41,642
Jan, don't make me
yell through the door.

1009
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:43,482
Look...

1010
01:20:44,555 --> 01:20:46,955
Look, Nicky, I want you to go away.
I really mean it.

1011
01:20:47,024 --> 01:20:50,118
- They're gonna kill me.
- Well, I'm not interested.

1012
01:20:50,194 --> 01:20:52,059
- Dave Resnick...
- I'm not interested.

1013
01:20:52,129 --> 01:20:55,155
- He's after me.
- Why are you telling this to me?

1014
01:20:55,232 --> 01:20:57,632
- Honey, I'm serious now.
- Hmm.

1015
01:20:57,701 --> 01:21:00,226
Ed Lipsky's dead.
Dave Resnick had him killed.

1016
01:21:00,304 --> 01:21:03,967
I told you that he would. People get
angry when you steal their money.

1017
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:08,137
Listen, I, uh...
I did some serious thinking

1018
01:21:08,212 --> 01:21:11,272
- about myself last night.
- Good.

1019
01:21:11,348 --> 01:21:14,249
And about the way
that I've treated you.

1020
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:18,816
And I just want you to know
I understand more

1021
01:21:18,889 --> 01:21:20,481
what you were trying to tell me.

1022
01:21:20,557 --> 01:21:22,525
I'd just like a few minutes
to talk to you about it.

1023
01:21:22,593 --> 01:21:25,289
No.

1024
01:21:25,362 --> 01:21:29,765
Open the door. I said, open this
goddamned door before I break it down.

1025
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:33,465
You really have changed.

1026
01:21:33,537 --> 01:21:35,698
I wouldn't have recognized you.

1027
01:21:35,773 --> 01:21:39,265
I ought to
smash your face right in.

1028
01:21:39,343 --> 01:21:41,311
Bitch.

1029
01:21:41,945 --> 01:21:45,813
Son of a bitch!

1030
01:21:45,883 --> 01:21:48,249
I'm sorry, baby.
God, I'm sorry, honey.

1031
01:21:50,421 --> 01:21:54,221
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Just get out.

1032
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:56,156
Please, baby,
don't treat me this way.

1033
01:21:56,226 --> 01:21:58,660
Is this how your girlfriends treat you?
Tell me how they treat you

1034
01:21:58,729 --> 01:22:00,924
and I'll try to copy it.

1035
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:05,766
- Jan, I'm sorry.
- What, is everybody else busy tonight?

1036
01:22:05,836 --> 01:22:08,999
All your girlfriends busy? The boys
too busy to have a drink with you?

1037
01:22:09,073 --> 01:22:11,337
It's a shame Resnick wants
to have you killed.

1038
01:22:11,408 --> 01:22:14,002
Now you won't be able to spend
all your evenings with him.

1039
01:22:14,078 --> 01:22:18,344
Tell me what he used to do that was
so wonderful, and I'll try to copy it.

1040
01:22:18,415 --> 01:22:19,575
Jan.

1041
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:23,586
No, I'm not gonna...
I did this for you.

1042
01:22:23,654 --> 01:22:26,214
I went to work for you.
I didn't do it for me.

1043
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:30,124
- Thank you for supporting me.
- That's not what I meant.

1044
01:22:30,194 --> 01:22:32,128
I don't care what you meant.

1045
01:22:32,196 --> 01:22:33,993
Don't you get it yet?
I really don't care.

1046
01:22:34,064 --> 01:22:36,259
- I just want you to get out of here.
- You mean that.

1047
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:39,496
Yes, I do. I mean it.

1048
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:43,028
Okay.
Can I take a look at the baby?

1049
01:22:43,107 --> 01:22:44,972
Would it make any difference
what I said?

1050
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:47,010
Yes. If you don't want me to,
I won't.

1051
01:22:47,077 --> 01:22:50,535
Do what you want. Do what you
want to, and then get out of here.

1052
01:23:02,025 --> 01:23:03,788
Ah!

1053
01:23:03,861 --> 01:23:06,659
Hiya!

1054
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,756
Come here.
Come here, baby. I love you.

1055
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:13,360
Are you Daddy's girl?
You wanna hold Daddy's thumb?

1056
01:23:13,437 --> 01:23:16,770
Yeah. Here, sweetheart.
Hold Daddy's thumb. Come on.

1057
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,139
Here.
You love your daddy? Huh?

1058
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:22,804
Come on. Hold Daddy's thumb.

1059
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,212
Just once.

1060
01:23:25,282 --> 01:23:26,909
Here. Look at this.

1061
01:23:26,984 --> 01:23:30,852
Look.
All right. All right.

1062
01:23:35,392 --> 01:23:37,690
I guess she's mad at me too.

1063
01:23:37,761 --> 01:23:41,253
Wouldn't hold my thumb.

1064
01:23:41,331 --> 01:23:45,461
- Do you need any money? Huh?
- No, I'm all right.

1065
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:49,939
I need a shot in the head,
and I'm gonna get that anyway.

1066
01:23:52,776 --> 01:23:55,745
Why don't you get ahold of Mikey?
He'll help you.

1067
01:23:55,813 --> 01:23:59,442
I can't get ahold of Mikey
'cause we had a bad fight.

1068
01:23:59,516 --> 01:24:01,746
What's the matter with you, huh?
He's the only friend you have.

1069
01:24:01,819 --> 01:24:04,049
Not anymore.

1070
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:06,453
I did too much to him.

1071
01:24:07,524 --> 01:24:11,620
Yeah, well, you get outta town.
If you get outta town, you'll be...

1072
01:24:11,695 --> 01:24:14,459
Thanks for the advice.

1073
01:24:14,531 --> 01:24:16,362
What do you want me to do?
You want me to die for you?

1074
01:24:16,433 --> 01:24:20,062
I don't want anything.
I'm goin'.

1075
01:24:21,405 --> 01:24:23,930
Will you kiss me good-bye?

1076
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:25,998
No?

1077
01:24:26,076 --> 01:24:27,907
Yes?

1078
01:24:27,978 --> 01:24:30,708
No. All right.

1079
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:46,691
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1080
01:24:46,763 --> 01:24:48,253
Jan.

1081
01:24:52,002 --> 01:24:54,630
What are you staying here for?

1082
01:24:55,706 --> 01:24:57,970
They're gonna get you.
You've gotta get out of town.

1083
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:00,805
I know it.
I had to see you.

1084
01:25:00,878 --> 01:25:04,245
But now you'll go, hmm?
Will you go?

1085
01:25:04,314 --> 01:25:06,407
Baby, everything's going to be okay.
You know that?

1086
01:25:06,483 --> 01:25:08,314
- Everything's going to be great.
- Okay.

1087
01:25:08,385 --> 01:25:11,115
It's going to be terrific.
I promise you, babe.

1088
01:25:11,188 --> 01:25:14,055
I can make you so happy.

1089
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:16,115
- Sure.
- I don't want you to die.

1090
01:25:16,193 --> 01:25:19,458
- I'm going to write to you, sweetheart.
- I don't want you to die.

1091
01:25:19,529 --> 01:25:21,724
Everything's going to be okay.
Do you love me?

1092
01:25:21,798 --> 01:25:23,561
I do. I love you.

1093
01:25:23,734 --> 01:25:26,532
Three terrific deals
I could have had

1094
01:25:26,603 --> 01:25:29,902
and I took this 'cause
I thought it'd be quicker.

1095
01:25:33,277 --> 01:25:37,737
Could have used the money
to bankroll some machines.

1096
01:25:37,814 --> 01:25:41,113
Got another guy waitin'
with the other half.

1097
01:25:41,184 --> 01:25:42,776
Make a left.

1098
01:25:55,232 --> 01:25:58,099
Watch it. There's a guy
in this alley right here.

1099
01:25:59,636 --> 01:26:02,196
All right. Right there.
Is that him?

1100
01:26:02,272 --> 01:26:06,208
- Is he the guy?
- Wait a minute!

1101
01:26:06,276 --> 01:26:09,211
You dumb bastard.

1102
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:11,270
Is that him?

1103
01:26:13,016 --> 01:26:14,347
No.

1104
01:26:18,922 --> 01:26:21,652
I'm warning you,
get out of here.

1105
01:26:24,428 --> 01:26:26,953
I'm really getting the treatment
tonight. Tonight's my night.

1106
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:29,021
What do you want?

1107
01:26:29,099 --> 01:26:32,193
I thought we'd lie down
and talk about politics for a while.

1108
01:26:35,072 --> 01:26:37,939
You know, I could punch your face
right through the wall. You know that?

1109
01:26:38,008 --> 01:26:41,136
You have no right
to treat me like this.

1110
01:26:41,211 --> 01:26:43,702
- A lady like you.
- You better get out of here.

1111
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:45,680
Why?

1112
01:26:45,749 --> 01:26:48,775
Why?
Why should I get out of here?

1113
01:26:48,852 --> 01:26:50,717
- I just came over to say I'm sorry.
- I'll bet.

1114
01:26:50,787 --> 01:26:52,778
I'm not kidding.

1115
01:26:52,856 --> 01:26:57,350
I was a little sore before about
Moe Schatz and Jack Diamond.

1116
01:26:57,427 --> 01:27:00,225
I thought you were my girl.

1117
01:27:00,297 --> 01:27:04,563
And then I find out that you're
putting it out for everyone.

1118
01:27:04,634 --> 01:27:06,397
Jesus Christ, this is...

1119
01:27:08,705 --> 01:27:10,104
Gee.

1120
01:27:15,345 --> 01:27:17,905
What is it?

1121
01:27:17,981 --> 01:27:20,541
You told them.

1122
01:27:20,617 --> 01:27:23,245
You told them to try it.

1123
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,878
Both of them.

1124
01:27:24,955 --> 01:27:28,356
You think I would do that?
Are you crazy?

1125
01:27:28,425 --> 01:27:31,155
Don't. I know.
They told me.

1126
01:27:31,228 --> 01:27:33,219
Both of them.

1127
01:27:34,998 --> 01:27:39,935
I know all the things
that you say about me.

1128
01:27:40,904 --> 01:27:43,065
I know all about it.

1129
01:27:51,681 --> 01:27:53,672
Don't cry.

1130
01:27:55,786 --> 01:27:57,344
Please.

1131
01:27:58,889 --> 01:28:00,880
Don't cry.

1132
01:28:06,863 --> 01:28:10,128
- Don't be mad at me.
- Oh.

1133
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,795
Are you mad at me now

1134
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:17,033
because I told you I know?

1135
01:28:17,107 --> 01:28:19,871
I'm not mad.

1136
01:28:19,943 --> 01:28:21,433
Hell...

1137
01:28:24,815 --> 01:28:27,579
Hell, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1138
01:28:31,521 --> 01:28:33,580
I guess I just like to show off.

1139
01:28:35,892 --> 01:28:38,622
- Dead end.
- I know.

1140
01:28:39,963 --> 01:28:42,989
Jesus.

1141
01:28:45,368 --> 01:28:48,701
This is the end.
By the time I've paid...

1142
01:28:48,772 --> 01:28:52,037
- Go right.
- Paid the fare, paid for meals

1143
01:28:52,109 --> 01:28:55,078
I ain't gonna make a thing on this.

1144
01:29:00,951 --> 01:29:03,385
Nah, we've seen that guy.

1145
01:29:12,062 --> 01:29:14,656
I look like a schmuck.

1146
01:29:14,731 --> 01:29:18,030
I only got about three,
four guys that use me.

1147
01:29:18,101 --> 01:29:21,127
I'll look worse 'cause it was
supposed to be easy.

1148
01:29:22,205 --> 01:29:25,265
It was easy.

1149
01:29:25,342 --> 01:29:28,243
If it didn't take you 45 minutes
to drive downtown

1150
01:29:28,311 --> 01:29:30,302
you would have gotten him
in the first bar.

1151
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,245
The hell I could.

1152
01:29:32,315 --> 01:29:34,306
Oh, no, you don't.

1153
01:29:36,953 --> 01:29:41,117
45 minutes.
I watched the clock.

1154
01:29:43,527 --> 01:29:49,488
Okay, you tell it your way,
and I'm gonna tell it my way.

1155
01:29:49,566 --> 01:29:54,162
'Cause all I know is I spent an hour
in both places, I never saw the guy.

1156
01:29:55,172 --> 01:29:57,834
Jesus.

1157
01:30:04,347 --> 01:30:06,247
That's him!

1158
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:17,790
- Let me out of the car.
- Just take it easy, will ya?

1159
01:30:17,861 --> 01:30:20,352
Let me out of the car.

1160
01:30:22,098 --> 01:30:24,931
Let me out of the car.

1161
01:30:26,169 --> 01:30:28,194
Let me out of the car.

1162
01:30:45,789 --> 01:30:47,916
It's not him.

1163
01:30:55,232 --> 01:30:58,599
- Got any ice cream?
- No ice cream.

1164
01:31:02,672 --> 01:31:06,699
We got egg cream, soda

1165
01:31:06,776 --> 01:31:10,712
Popsicles,
magazines, candy

1166
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:13,715
cigarettes...
just what you see.

1167
01:31:13,783 --> 01:31:16,547
What kind of a candy store is this,
you don't have ice cream?

1168
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:20,215
It's a candy store
without ice cream. Just what you see.

1169
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:24,252
Got Neccos?

1170
01:31:24,327 --> 01:31:29,094
Look on my counter, mister.
What you see there is what I got.

1171
01:31:36,573 --> 01:31:38,734
I'll take some of these.

1172
01:31:42,112 --> 01:31:44,103
Some of these.

1173
01:31:46,116 --> 01:31:49,347
- Caramel creams.
- I'll take some of these lollipops.

1174
01:31:49,419 --> 01:31:52,081
- All right.
- I'll eat this one in the store.

1175
01:31:52,155 --> 01:31:54,521
- Put the rest in the bag.
- Right.

1176
01:31:54,591 --> 01:31:56,354
All right.

1177
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,920
- Got any comic books?
- On the rack.

1178
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:13,476
I promised my nephew
that I would find him a comic book.

1179
01:32:13,543 --> 01:32:15,773
All right. Yeah, sure.

1180
01:32:17,547 --> 01:32:19,208
So I'm just gonna browse for now.

1181
01:32:19,282 --> 01:32:22,683
Mm-hm. But don't get 'em
sticky, please.

1182
01:32:27,023 --> 01:32:29,719
I don't think they
make Necco anymore.

1183
01:32:29,793 --> 01:32:33,058
So, any estimation of time
which I may have given him

1184
01:32:33,129 --> 01:32:35,791
is dependent on the fact that
he knows what I've got to get through.

1185
01:32:35,865 --> 01:32:40,461
Okay, okay.
So you both had problems.

1186
01:32:40,537 --> 01:32:42,300
Well

1187
01:32:42,372 --> 01:32:45,364
he didn't ask me for any
directions on the phone.

1188
01:32:45,442 --> 01:32:47,239
He just asked me where it was.
I gave him the address.

1189
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,244
- Yeah.
- You know what I think?

1190
01:32:49,312 --> 01:32:52,440
I think if I want to find this buddy of
yours, I should stay on your ass

1191
01:32:52,515 --> 01:32:54,483
<i>maybe for the next 24 hours.</i>

1192
01:32:54,551 --> 01:32:58,282
I'll let you do what you think is best.
I have a lot of respect for your mind.

1193
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:00,414
- Mr. Resnick...
- Okay.

1194
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:02,651
Let's put...

1195
01:33:02,726 --> 01:33:07,561
Go home. Ah...

1196
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:09,621
You wanna drive him home?

1197
01:33:09,699 --> 01:33:14,136
- Warren?
- I'll drive him home if you want.

1198
01:33:14,204 --> 01:33:16,900
He'll drive you home.

1199
01:33:16,973 --> 01:33:22,001
Maybe he could even park
in front of his house.

1200
01:33:22,078 --> 01:33:26,174
- That nut could show up there.
- He's not gonna come to my house.

1201
01:33:26,249 --> 01:33:29,446
We had a fight. He hit me.

1202
01:33:29,519 --> 01:33:34,013
- He broke my watch, insulted me.
- Oh-ho-ho.

1203
01:33:35,325 --> 01:33:40,285
He said you didn't like me.

1204
01:33:40,363 --> 01:33:44,459
Go home, Mikey.
It's very late.

1205
01:33:44,534 --> 01:33:47,935
- So, go home and...
- He's not going to come to my house.

1206
01:33:48,004 --> 01:33:49,494
- Take him home.
- Yes, sir. I'll watch him.

1207
01:33:49,572 --> 01:33:52,097
- You want me to stay outside his house?
- Yeah.

1208
01:33:52,175 --> 01:33:55,633
- Okay, I'll do that.
- You can't stay in front of my house.

1209
01:33:55,712 --> 01:33:58,647
- What?
- There's no parking there.

1210
01:33:58,715 --> 01:34:01,183
- There's no parking?
- You can't park there.

1211
01:34:01,251 --> 01:34:04,118
The owners have hired
their own private patrol cars.

1212
01:34:04,187 --> 01:34:06,121
It's an exclusive neighborhood.

1213
01:34:06,189 --> 01:34:09,386
They had to vote on me
before I could buy the house.

1214
01:34:09,459 --> 01:34:14,658
So, all right, he won't park there.
He'll circle the block.

1215
01:34:14,731 --> 01:34:16,892
- Yes, sir.
- Dave.

1216
01:34:16,966 --> 01:34:19,161
Huh?

1217
01:34:19,235 --> 01:34:22,966
If he keeps circling the block,
they're gonna notice.

1218
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:26,668
We have our own
private patrol cars.

1219
01:34:26,743 --> 01:34:32,010
Then circle two blocks.
How's that?

1220
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:34,914
They're gonna notice him
driving around there.

1221
01:34:34,984 --> 01:34:37,919
- I think I can handle that.
- Yeah. All right.

1222
01:34:37,987 --> 01:34:43,220
Uh, take him home.
I'm tired. You're tired, he's tired.

1223
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:47,022
You're gettin' on my nerves, Mike.

1224
01:34:47,096 --> 01:34:49,462
- Take him home.
- Yes, sir.

1225
01:34:49,532 --> 01:34:52,831
- Dave?
- What?

1226
01:34:53,903 --> 01:34:56,133
You know, I'm sorry
you don't like me.

1227
01:34:56,206 --> 01:34:58,367
Ah, come on.

1228
01:35:00,176 --> 01:35:03,270
And I'm sorry
I make you nervous.

1229
01:35:03,346 --> 01:35:05,143
It's all right.

1230
01:35:28,638 --> 01:35:30,572
What?

1231
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:35,441
- Nothing.
- Here, honey. You want this coffee?

1232
01:35:35,512 --> 01:35:38,538
Mikey?
Why is this light off?

1233
01:35:38,615 --> 01:35:41,106
You need to see.

1234
01:35:41,184 --> 01:35:43,084
- Here's your coffee.
- Honey, why don't you go to bed?

1235
01:35:43,152 --> 01:35:46,781
- You'll be out on your feet tomorrow.
- No, I want to wait up for you.

1236
01:35:46,856 --> 01:35:52,123
This is a nice surprise, 'cause
I thought I was gonna be Ionesome

1237
01:35:52,195 --> 01:35:54,390
and sad.

1238
01:35:54,464 --> 01:35:57,922
You walked into my life.

1239
01:35:58,001 --> 01:36:00,663
You want one?

1240
01:36:00,737 --> 01:36:02,728
What time is it?

1241
01:36:02,805 --> 01:36:05,035
It's about 5:00.

1242
01:36:08,344 --> 01:36:10,778
What happened to your watch?

1243
01:36:11,781 --> 01:36:14,147
- Hmm?
- I broke it.

1244
01:36:14,217 --> 01:36:17,084
Oh, when you fell.
Oh, honey.

1245
01:36:17,153 --> 01:36:20,088
Your good watch.

1246
01:36:22,892 --> 01:36:26,851
Did you ever go to one of those
meetings at school?

1247
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:28,795
They have sewing in school.

1248
01:36:28,865 --> 01:36:31,891
The boys sew
while the girls go to shop.

1249
01:36:31,968 --> 01:36:34,300
You know, because I guess it's...

1250
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:38,932
you're not supposed to think that
only women sew and only men carve

1251
01:36:39,008 --> 01:36:40,839
or...

1252
01:36:43,346 --> 01:36:46,645
- Care for a...
- Do I repeat myself when I talk?

1253
01:36:46,716 --> 01:36:49,014
Hmm?

1254
01:36:49,085 --> 01:36:51,076
When I talk

1255
01:36:51,154 --> 01:36:53,884
do you hear me
repeating myself?

1256
01:36:53,957 --> 01:36:55,857
No.

1257
01:36:55,925 --> 01:36:57,586
Ever?

1258
01:36:59,596 --> 01:37:03,088
Maybe.
I never noticed it.

1259
01:37:03,166 --> 01:37:05,259
Well, notice it.

1260
01:37:05,335 --> 01:37:08,702
From now on,
when I do something, notice it.

1261
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:14,366
Okay, hon.

1262
01:37:22,619 --> 01:37:27,556
Did I ever tell you I had
a brother, Izzy, who died?

1263
01:37:27,624 --> 01:37:30,149
No, I don't think so.

1264
01:37:30,226 --> 01:37:33,559
I don't remember.
When did he die?

1265
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:36,155
Years ago.

1266
01:37:36,232 --> 01:37:38,427
This happened
when I was a kid.

1267
01:37:38,501 --> 01:37:41,993
You enjoy hearing stories
of when I was...

1268
01:37:42,071 --> 01:37:46,974
- well, when I was a kid?
- Yeah, sure I do, honey.

1269
01:37:48,511 --> 01:37:50,706
Well, Izzy was ten.

1270
01:37:51,781 --> 01:37:54,409
He had scarlet fever.

1271
01:37:54,484 --> 01:37:58,386
And when the fever got so high
he lost all his hair

1272
01:37:58,454 --> 01:38:00,854
and then he died.

1273
01:38:00,923 --> 01:38:03,585
- That's terrible.
- My mother just sat there.

1274
01:38:05,662 --> 01:38:09,496
- She didn't even cry.
- It's a terrible thing to lose a child.

1275
01:38:09,565 --> 01:38:13,524
- Was he the baby?
- No, he was ten.

1276
01:38:13,603 --> 01:38:16,868
No, no. I mean,
was he younger than you?

1277
01:38:16,939 --> 01:38:19,407
Oh, yeah.

1278
01:38:19,475 --> 01:38:22,876
My father cried, I remember.

1279
01:38:22,945 --> 01:38:27,609
But my mother,
she just sat there.

1280
01:38:29,886 --> 01:38:33,287
- I was the favorite.
- Oh, l...

1281
01:38:33,356 --> 01:38:35,824
My father cried like a baby.

1282
01:38:35,892 --> 01:38:40,556
And when Izzy got sick,
he gave him his watch.

1283
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:42,825
- The one I have.
- The one you broke.

1284
01:38:42,899 --> 01:38:44,423
Yeah. But

1285
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:48,698
that was

1286
01:38:48,771 --> 01:38:53,504
just because he was sick
that he gave it to him.

1287
01:38:53,576 --> 01:38:55,441
Mm-hm.

1288
01:38:55,511 --> 01:39:00,505
He meant it for me.
I was the oldest.

1289
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:05,020
And when Izzy died,
he took it back and gave it to me.

1290
01:39:08,357 --> 01:39:11,656
He only gave it to Izzy because
Izzy was always asking to wear it.

1291
01:39:13,262 --> 01:39:15,492
So, uh, I guess

1292
01:39:15,565 --> 01:39:20,025
that when he knew
that Izzy was gonna die

1293
01:39:21,571 --> 01:39:26,565
he felt that it was all right,
safe to give it to him.

1294
01:39:26,642 --> 01:39:28,701
That's sad.

1295
01:39:30,646 --> 01:39:33,740
I was crazy about Izzy.

1296
01:39:35,752 --> 01:39:38,880
I felt terrible
when he got sick.

1297
01:39:40,123 --> 01:39:42,216
But you know a kid looks funny
when he's bald.

1298
01:39:42,291 --> 01:39:44,122
Bald?

1299
01:39:45,194 --> 01:39:48,527
I just told you, he lost all his hair
because of the fever.

1300
01:39:48,598 --> 01:39:50,793
I'm sorry. I forgot.
Yes, I see. I see.

1301
01:39:59,008 --> 01:40:01,841
Nick Godalin knew Izzy.

1302
01:40:01,911 --> 01:40:04,379
Oh, my goodness.

1303
01:40:07,817 --> 01:40:10,843
Nick Godalin knew my mother,
my father

1304
01:40:12,789 --> 01:40:14,916
and my Aunt Rose.

1305
01:40:14,991 --> 01:40:20,486
Hmm. Well, I envy him.

1306
01:40:20,563 --> 01:40:22,895
Wish I'd known your father.

1307
01:40:22,965 --> 01:40:27,129
You wouldn't have liked him.
He was a very solemn man

1308
01:40:27,203 --> 01:40:29,933
and he didn't like
any of the women in the family.

1309
01:40:31,507 --> 01:40:33,839
But he liked Nick.

1310
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:37,905
And he liked Izzy.

1311
01:40:40,016 --> 01:40:43,179
See, Nick kidded him a lot.

1312
01:40:43,252 --> 01:40:46,847
And I'm sure he liked you too.

1313
01:41:02,672 --> 01:41:04,401
Go to bed, Annie.

1314
01:41:05,374 --> 01:41:08,639
I told you, I'm not a bit tired.
I'm not gonna go to bed.

1315
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:11,544
- Son of a bitch.
- What is it?

1316
01:41:11,614 --> 01:41:14,674
- Don't answer the door.
- Why? Who's coming?

1317
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:18,049
- Mikey?
- We can let him in.

1318
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:21,487
- Don't say anything.
- Hey, Mikey.

1319
01:41:21,557 --> 01:41:25,789
Mikey, you're gonna make it up with me
sometime, why not now?

1320
01:41:27,663 --> 01:41:32,930
- Come on, Mikey. Open the door.
- Tell him I'm not here.

1321
01:41:33,002 --> 01:41:35,129
Get him away from here.

1322
01:41:38,107 --> 01:41:40,405
- Mikey isn't here.
- Annie?

1323
01:41:40,476 --> 01:41:42,910
He isn't home.

1324
01:41:42,979 --> 01:41:44,674
Annie, is that you?
Did I wake you up, honey?

1325
01:41:44,747 --> 01:41:47,716
I'm sorry.
I thought Mikey was home.

1326
01:41:47,783 --> 01:41:52,584
- No, he isn't home.
- Oh. You know who this is, right?

1327
01:41:52,655 --> 01:41:55,351
It's Nicky Godalin.

1328
01:41:55,424 --> 01:41:57,790
Yes, he isn't home, Nick.

1329
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:00,920
Oh, he's not, huh?

1330
01:42:00,997 --> 01:42:03,830
You think I could come in
and wait for him till he gets back?

1331
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:09,429
He ought to be home soon. I left him
an hour ago, he was on his way home.

1332
01:42:09,505 --> 01:42:12,599
Would it be all right?
It won't take long.

1333
01:42:12,675 --> 01:42:18,113
Nick, I'm not feeling very well, so why
don't you come back tomorrow, okay?

1334
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:21,445
Gee, honey, I wish I could,
but I'm leaving town.

1335
01:42:21,517 --> 01:42:25,044
It's very important
that I see Mikey before I go.

1336
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:27,589
Let me just come in,
just till he comes home.

1337
01:42:27,657 --> 01:42:33,254
Well, I'd like to, Nick, but Mikey said
not to let anybody in, so I can't.

1338
01:42:33,329 --> 01:42:35,490
Annie, who do you got in there,
a Chinaman?

1339
01:42:35,564 --> 01:42:38,658
- Oh, Nick. Go home.
- Come on.

1340
01:42:38,734 --> 01:42:41,259
I don't think he meant me
when he said don't let anyone in.

1341
01:42:41,337 --> 01:42:44,773
Look, Nick, you can't come in,
so please go away.

1342
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:47,172
- I'll tell Mikey you were here.
- Annie.

1343
01:42:47,243 --> 01:42:50,735
Annie?
Are you mad at me?

1344
01:42:50,813 --> 01:42:54,044
No. But just go.

1345
01:42:54,116 --> 01:42:58,712
Look, honey, it's very important
that I see him, really.

1346
01:42:58,788 --> 01:43:01,052
Nicky, would you go away?

1347
01:43:01,123 --> 01:43:02,818
Annie.

1348
01:43:06,562 --> 01:43:09,156
You gotta go away, honey.

1349
01:43:09,231 --> 01:43:10,823
Annie.

1350
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:15,030
- Come back tomorrow.
- I think you better let me in, Annie.

1351
01:43:16,072 --> 01:43:18,438
Annie. Annie.

1352
01:43:18,507 --> 01:43:21,806
Annie, I think you better let me in.
Please let me in, Annie.

1353
01:43:21,877 --> 01:43:23,777
Run, schmuck.

1354
01:43:23,846 --> 01:43:28,249
Annie, I don't feel good.
Annie, I'm sick.

1355
01:43:28,317 --> 01:43:31,309
Annie. Annie. Annie.

1356
01:43:31,387 --> 01:43:32,411
Annie. Annie.

1357
01:43:32,488 --> 01:43:36,857
Annie, please! Annie,
I don't feel well. I'm gonna be sick.

1358
01:43:36,926 --> 01:43:40,123
Oh!

1359
01:43:42,898 --> 01:43:47,028
Please, Mikey!
Mikey, get me a doctor!

1360
01:43:47,103 --> 01:43:49,435
Get me a doctor, Mikey!

1361
01:43:49,505 --> 01:43:51,473
Please! Get me a doctor!

1362
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:56,375
Annie! Let me in!
Let me in!

1363
01:43:56,445 --> 01:44:00,779
