1
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,970
Weather tracking systems
have put the storms

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,470
that are currently about
two hours north of us,

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,740
so now's the time to get
your supplies, San Vicente.

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,570
For the next 18 to 24 hours,
we're gonna get up to 8 inches

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,180
of rain with wind gusts
up to 60 miles per hour.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,810
The storm's coming, people.
Get ready to be blown away.

7
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,670
He ambushed me with a
two carat diamond ring

8
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,210
and a damn minister.

9
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,550
Hey, he didn't say anything
about leavin' Crystal, did he?

10
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,480
Does she even know?

11
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,450
I call that good news.
Lead with that next time.

12
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,990
Well, if it were any other
kind, I'd say the same thing.

13
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,830
But Pernell? The way he's been acting.

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
Come on, Tessie. This might as
well be from fake documents.com.

15
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,100
It's not legal, it's not real.
Let him play out his little fantasy.

16
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,500
No, I'm not goin' there.
Not even make-believe.

17
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,540
He's leaning on you, Tessie.

18
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:01,959
And if you step away,
I'm afraid of how hard

19
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,289
he might fall.

20
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,450
But if you stay, somethin' good can

21
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,950
come out of this.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,920
- I mean... for you, I mean.
- Like what?

23
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,390
What, a picket fence? Stroller?

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,890
Not a part of my plan.

25
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,460
Nothing like that.

26
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,909
Woman in your line of
work doesn't have much

27
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,909
of a pension plan.

28
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,660
Don't worry about me.

29
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,230
I will not be dippin' in
the penny jar when I retire.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,970
Sure, sure... you're a smart lady,

31
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,870
I know that, but those properties you have

32
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:28,019
on the Westside...

33
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,900
they could have some real potential.

34
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,110
Once we get the Brooks Project done,

35
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,780
we're gonna need some of that new, um...

36
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,059
What do you call that shit?

37
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,710
Sustainable, low-impact ecosystems.

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,220
Yeah, ecosystems.

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,050
Hipsters and double-strollers,

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,350
living in housing made
of bamboo and whatnot.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,350
Properties in neighborhoods
where that shit goes in,

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,890
they are going to triple in value...

43
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,990
maybe more.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,160
You sure they're going on the Westside?

45
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,010
TBD, girl.

46
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,300
TB-fucking-D.

48
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,730
So, Julio was working with the dead cop

49
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,470
and then he killed him.

50
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,510
I sure like the way that ring looks on you.

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,110
I like knowing we're married.

52
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,180
Pernell, I'm trying to wrap my head

53
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,150
around what you want me to do.

54
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,480
Can we focus on that for a minute?

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,490
Okay, yeah.

56
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,990
Julio says the contact had a place

57
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,490
at the Eastwood Apartments.

58
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,990
So whoever rented the apartment

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,730
was the bad guy?

60
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,109
Maybe.

61
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,109
I need for you to go there

62
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,040
and get me a name.

63
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,070
Pernell,

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,410
you're talking about rapists and killers.

65
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,040
Being a P.I. is not a part

66
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,740
of my job description.

67
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,310
Job description?

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,450
I got down on one knee for you.

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,420
If you think of me as anything more

70
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,190
than a fucking John,
you're gonna do this for me.

71
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,520
Talking to me like that
will get you nowhere.

72
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,560
You see? We even fight
like an old married couple.

73
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,890
- Pernell, please.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

74
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,540
Would you please do this for me?

76
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,340
Tess?

77
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,040
I would do it myself, except I'm afraid

78
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,189
it'll come back on me.

79
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,559
I need to send somebody I know

80
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,040
and I trust and I don't trust anybody

81
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,850
more than you, Tess.

82
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,460
What's the address?

83
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,600
Morning, all.

84
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,400
Mr. Harris, Mrs. Harris.

85
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,070
What are you doing here, Josh?

86
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,200
You're about to see.

87
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,350
You know,
almost half the people

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,350
in skydiving accidents survive them.

89
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,399
Bullshit.

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,920
Seriously,

91
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,890
they might end up vegetables,
but they don't all die.

92
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:11,309
What's the difference?

93
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,100
Who wants to live like that anyway?

94
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,500
You speak for Stephen Hawking?

95
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,540
I speak for me, man.

96
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,270
Seriously, if I bounce and I don't die,

97
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,910
DNR all the way, man!

98
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,450
Yeah!

99
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,399
I think we can all agree.

100
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,950
There's nothing more to discuss now that

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,820
we've heard Pernell Harris
Jr.'s wishes for a DNR...

102
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,560
Fuck that.

103
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,690
You don't tell me when there's
nothing else to discuss.

104
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,140
I tell you.

105
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,860
We'll never let the video in. It's hearsay.

106
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,670
Well, you're welcome to
try to make that argument,

107
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,400
but we are hearing it
right from PJ's mouth.

108
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,470
Hearing what? A joke?

109
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,410
That's not a joke and you know it.

110
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,380
PJ's not here to testify to state-of-mind.

111
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,580
The guy who shot the video can.

112
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,180
That's what Mr. Miller is doing here.

113
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,280
Is that right?

114
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,729
Is that why you're here, Josh?

115
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,550
Why do we have to drag this out?

116
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,560
Your son is talking to you.
He's telling you what he wants.

117
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,160
No, we don't know that
he would say that today.

118
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,460
I do. The last thing PJ would want

119
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:20,679
is for me to let you pull the plug.

120
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,300
We'll be contesting the video.

121
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,900
You mean you'll be delaying the inevitable.

122
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,440
Chronic care facilities
will not be evacuated,

123
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,240
but ventilator-dependent
patients in these facilities

124
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,410
will be transferred to a hospital.

125
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,220
We're making this determination
based on the nature

126
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,180
of the storm, okay?

127
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,420
Thank you.

128
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,760
That's good notes. Thanks, James.

129
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,930
And can you hold on to them for me?

130
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,260
Okay, ah, kay.

131
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,300
Erwin.

132
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,970
When did you decide it was okay

133
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,840
to ignore calls from the mayor?

134
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,100
I'm not ignoring them. I'm
a little busy at the moment.

135
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,110
I wasn't calling about storm preparations.

136
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,159
We never got to finish our conversation

137
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,710
at the Conclave.

138
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,510
No, I thought it was over

139
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
when I told Pernell to go fuck himself.

140
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:16,069
Come on, Erwin.

141
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,469
You know Pernell wasn't
really trying to convert you.

142
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,739
He just got carried away.

143
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,420
And if I could take it
back for him, I would.

144
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,560
But I need that grid expansion
and you want some things too,

145
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:23,909
- right?
- Not if it means

146
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,630
swallowing Pernell's shit.

147
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,060
Now, see? There's your mistake.

148
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,470
Now, you're letting personal
get in the way of business.

149
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,070
It's hard not to when someone says,

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,140
"Your people killed Christ
and you're going to hell."

151
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,940
You know he crossed a line, Robert.

152
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:41,289
What line?

153
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,659
He didn't put his hands on you.

154
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,140
He didn't hurt you. Those were words...

155
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,459
Nonsense talking.

156
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,699
You can't get caught up in that.

157
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,320
Oh, so there's no taking it too far?

158
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,790
So, if I called you a
nigger, you wouldn't care?

159
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,979
You sign up on that grid expansion,

160
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,360
you can call me whatever the fuck you want.

161
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,800
Okay, nigger.

162
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,270
You know what it'd take to get me onboard

163
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:11,619
for the Brook's grid expansion?

164
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,540
Everything I've already asked for,

165
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,280
plus a separate budget allocation

166
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,850
from the discretionary fund.

167
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,300
Let me know if you can make that happen,

168
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,950
nigger.

169
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,190
Brother Harris called.
He says he needs to talk.

170
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,800
- He's on his way.
- Good.

171
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,300
You can give him his check back.

172
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,870
Yes, I still have it.

173
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,770
I do not feel right about how we got it.

174
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,210
Brother Harris wanted to make a donation.

175
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,910
What's the problem?

176
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,720
The problem is that you
married him to his call girl.

177
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,650
That's polygamy. It's against the law.

178
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,790
No one who relies on the law is justified

179
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,240
before God because the righteous

180
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,260
will live by faith.

181
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,930
Paul?

182
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,400
You are compromising
the spiritual principles

183
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,430
of this church to enable this man.

184
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,870
Not "enable," save.

185
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,800
Brother Pernell is helping
us grow this church.

186
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,510
That donation will cover the check

187
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,880
you gave to Bishop Bruce.

188
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,510
We wouldn't have even needed the money

189
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,550
if you hadn't started smoking meth again.

190
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,420
I told you I did not smoke anything

191
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,799
that night.

192
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,660
Yeah, that is what you told me.

193
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,330
- Can you talk?
- Of course.

194
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,970
What can I do for you?

195
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,140
PJ's slipping away from me.

196
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,550
I'm running out of time.

197
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,280
I saw a video of him this morning.

198
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,220
He was so happy.

199
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,990
Happier than I've seen him

200
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,090
for so long.

201
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,160
I don't know if I've ever
seen that side of him.

202
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,400
That wasn't our thing.

203
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,400
Which is why I need him back.

204
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,440
I have to have a chance to...

205
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:26,789
Jesus...

206
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,740
Don't worry.

207
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:30,029
It's in the hands of the Lord.

208
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,159
I have to worry.

209
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,010
He said he doesn't want
to be on life-support.

210
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,680
He said that right to the fucking camera.

211
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,320
And when they show that in court,

212
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,290
I'm gonna lose.

213
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,460
PJ dies.

214
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,530
I need your help, Reverend.

215
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,440
I need to get my visions back.

216
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,440
We've talked about Daniel, right?

217
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,140
Yeah, he's the one with the visions, right?

218
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,590
Exactly.

219
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,280
But God didn't just grant him that gift.

220
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,529
He had to work for it.

221
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,450
While others ate, he fasted.

222
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:07,599
He did it to prove his willingness

223
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,850
to sacrifice for the Lord.

224
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,520
Maybe if you fasted, you'd
get your visions back.

225
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,460
Are you willing to make
that kind of commitment?

226
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,560
I'm willing to try anything.

227
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,030
But I'm scared.

228
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,030
The first thing you need to know is...

229
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,670
You're not alone.

230
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,970
Wait, the church is sending
people to the hospital?

231
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,480
The prayer warriors are gonna stay there

232
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,080
around the clock.

233
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,680
I shit you not.

234
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,380
- Prayer warriors?
- Yep.

235
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,620
Oh, Jesus Christ.

236
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:42,869
When is Pernell going to realize

237
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,490
these people are bat-shit crazy?

238
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,190
Mm. So I get a call

239
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,090
from Sister Alicia asking
if I can come by tomorrow

240
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,490
and help make food for 'em all.

241
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,660
Good.

242
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,300
Maybe she can tell you what kind of spell

243
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,500
that preacher has on my husband.

244
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:00,749
I am not going.

245
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,400
Big storm comes in like this, bad as it is?

246
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,449
Everybody want to stock up.

247
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,559
- Hey!
- Uh-uh.

248
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,960
My phone is blowing up.

249
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,210
You're supposed to be finding dirt for me.

250
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,810
This is a perfect opportunity.

251
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,980
I sorry, Mrs. Crystal...

252
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,420
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.

253
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,380
I only spies on the side.

254
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,190
Okay.

255
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,640
All right, fine.

256
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,630
On top of what I'm paying you,
I will buy all of your weed.

257
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,530
See, I thought I told you.

258
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,270
My blends...

259
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,370
are not just for profit.

260
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,840
My shit is community service.

261
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,280
Well, my family is part

262
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,010
of this community

263
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,850
and we need help more than anybody else

264
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,300
right now.

265
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,820
I don't think there's
enough space for the reading.

266
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm not talking about the whole group.

267
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,690
I'm talking about, like,
seven or eight people.

268
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,060
It'll be tight in here, but
I think we can make it work.

269
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,430
Doesn't feel premature?

270
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,600
You were there, Josh.

271
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:09,989
You and Pernell can't pretend that

272
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,770
that video isn't a game-changer.

273
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,570
They can put off the court date,

274
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,040
but the case, it's over.

275
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,580
I just want to give PJ a
proper send-off this time.

276
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,120
They're having a tribute next week.

277
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,590
I know, but PJ won't be there.

278
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,039
So, I want to do it here.

279
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,339
For him.

280
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,740
Okay.

281
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:30,339
I'm in.

282
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,360

have to read a poem.

Please, everybody, just go home, please.

296
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,940
Just go.

297
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,540
We're going to pray until
God gives us a miracle.

298
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,080
Why here, Pernell? You can pray anywhere.

299
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,650
Why you got to do it right in her face?

300
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,450
Shut your fucking mouth, you backstabber.

301
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:30,899
What, you think you're a hero?

302
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,390
You betrayed me and PJ.

303
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,660
Are you showing off for her?

304
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,760
Are you trying to get
next to my son's wife?

305
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,270
All I did was press "record."

306
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,900
PJ did the talking. And you heard him...

307
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,900
he doesn't want to be a vegetable.

308
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,670
When my son wakes up...

309
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,370
and he will wake up...

310
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:56,889
he's not gonna be a vegetable.

311
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,850
He's gonna be PJ.

312
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,710
With the help of the Lord, praise God.

313
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,029
Amen.

314
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:22,949
What's this?

315
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,070
I burnt some DVDs of PJ's videos.

316
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,710
Thought you and Crystal might enjoy seeing

317
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,610
some more of them.

318
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,420
Never seen anything like that before.

319
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,120
It's like a kumbaya convention.

320
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,220
They've kept this bullshit going for hours.

321
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,690
Pernell?

322
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,079
Hey!

323
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,700
Hey.

324
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,930
So...

325
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,700
This is how prayer warriors what, uh...

326
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,270
go to war?

327
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,880
All these people, here for our son.

328
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,980
Oh, that's nice.

329
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,680
Well, I just came to make
sure you got something

330
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:15,999
better to eat than hospital food.

331
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,190
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm fasting.

332
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,050
Fasting.

333
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:22,339
The Reverend Paul thought

334
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,420
it might open me up to the spirit.

335
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,160
Oh...

336
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,830
Is that what these people call

337
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,830
low blood-sugar?

338
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,370
It's chicken, pesto sauce... homemade.

339
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,140
I can't.

340
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,840
I need to hear PJ's voice again.

341
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,510
I need to restore my connection with God.

342
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,180
What about our connection?

343
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,180
I've been cooking for us.

344
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,180
And I love our dinners.

345
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,890
But if we're together, it doesn't matter

346
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,450
whether we're eating.

347
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,160
Pernell.

348
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,860
I have made room for
whatever you're going through.

349
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,890
Could you please just
make a little room for me?

350
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,870
I'm sorry, Crys.

351
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,870
Stay with me.

352
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:11,249
Pray with me.

353
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,540
Brothers, sisters, gather around.

354
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,210
Let us pray together.

355
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,350
Let us read from Isaiah.

356
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,980
"But those who hope in the Lord,
they will renew their strength.

357
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,320
They will soar on wings like eagles.

358
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,290
They will run and not grow weary.

359
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,590
They will walk and not be faint."

360
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:32,709
Amen.

361
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,130
- Amen.
- Amen.

362
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,700
The hospital said they
have every right to be here,

363
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,900
and they plan on praying until PJ wakes up.

364
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,410
Let me get into that.

365
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,410
In the meantime, try not to get converted.

366
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,790
You sure this is all you want me doing?

367
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,860
I feel like I'm getting off easy.

368
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,990
Everyone has their role.

369
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,200
I just assumed you'd be good at bagging.

370
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,970
That's not what I got my degree in.

371
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,770
But you do bag marijuana, right?

372
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,040
Or are the drug dealer rumors not true?

373
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,580
I have a side business.

374
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,850
I help people who are sick.

375
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,150
Glaucoma, cancer, diabetes.

376
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,320
You're practically a doctor.

377
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,390
- It's perfectly legal.
- That's nice.

378
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,990
Just don't be bringing any of that crap

379
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,430
around Hand of God.

380
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,900
We have a number of recovering addicts

381
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,400
in our congregation.

382
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,870
I don't come here for customers.

383
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,700
Why exactly do you come here?

384
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,270
Because I heard this church
was open and accepting,

385
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,110
not full of judgey assholes
like the church I grew up in.

386
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,850
But maybe I was wrong.

387
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,120
Accepting people and enabling people

388
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,320
are two entirely different
things, all right?

389
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,850
Drugs destroy peoples' lives
and their relation... shit!

390
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,490
Whoa. Let me see.

391
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,460
Oh, yeah.

392
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,330
I think you're gonna need
some stitches for this.

393
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,460
We'll finish lunch. We can continue.

394
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,230
No, you're gonna need
some stitches for this.

395
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,800
Whoa.

396
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,110
Maybe you should insist on it.

397
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,800
So...

398
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,250
What's up, nigger?

399
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,720
- What did you s...
- Hey, I got this.

400
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,330
How you doin', Erwin?

401
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:47,779
We still playing this game?

402
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,979
I'll stop

403
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,800
as soon as you admit there's a line.

404
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,070
I'm here to talk business.

405
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,040
Right, so, nigger...

406
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,640
will my department be getting
that allocation I requested?

407
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,710
I just need to know what
account you want it in

408
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:03,989
and what for.

409
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,680
Well, that's a good question, nigger.

410
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,150
We have a non-profit

411
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,150
called the DWP Schoolyard Improvement Fund.

412
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,690
Can you put it in there, nigger?

413
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,930
As soon as you sign off
on that grid expansion.

414
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,100
- Pen.
- Dad!

415
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,170
Fucking pen.

416
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,989
I'm not doing this.

417
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,480
I can't.

418
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,080
You wanna call me nigger a few more times,

419
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:42,399
put yourself back in the mood?

420
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,769
You think I like calling you that?

421
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,390
I'm trying to make a point.

422
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,950
And it was so eloquently made.

423
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,090
Pernell was wrong. I get that.

424
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,820
Now, let's finish our business.

425
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,330
No. The point is there is a line.

426
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,740
Let's go.

427
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,280
Come on.

428
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,650
What the fuck is wrong with you?

429
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,350
Who are you talking to?

430
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,850
You play the game until you win the game.

431
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,490
Oh, Dad, you've been saying
that since I was a kid

432
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,360
and you were running for the school board.

433
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,130
Okay? Now, you're the mayor.

434
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,260
Which means, at the very least,
I know how to get things done.

435
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,860
Yeah, but do you know
how to make a difference?

436
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,310
I am one concrete pour away

437
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,770
from making the biggest fucking difference

438
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:34,749
in the history of this city.

439
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,640
Are you fucking serious? Look, Dad...

440
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,240
Cops still fuck with me
when I'm jogging in the hood.

441
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,140
White guys at nice restaurants

442
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,680
still throw me their keys at the valet.

443
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,150
Schools are getting
shot-up and left for dead.

444
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,450
Okay, the same schools you went to.

445
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,990
And I'm gonna fix all of that.

446
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:54,299
When?

447
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,660
You think Brooks is the magic bullet?

448
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,160
Look, you just let that
asshole who ranks below you

449
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,160
call you a nigger...

450
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,900
N-I-G-G-E-R...

451
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,570
in the name of Brooks.

452
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,630
You're reading too many
Huey Newton speeches.

453
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,049
No, I'm not, Dad.

454
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,770
I'm telling kids they can
grow up to be like you one day,

455
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,470
and I'm waiting for you to set the example.

456
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,720
They all think it.

457
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,520
So who gives a fuck if they say it?

458
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,760
As long as they don't stop me
from getting what I came for.

459
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,960
And when you get that, Dad,

460
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,770
what are you gonna have left?

461
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,780
The view alone is worth the price.

462
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,220
It is beautiful, but can you headline

463
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,480
the building's security features for me?

464
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,020
My client and his wife just had a baby

465
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,990
and they have kidnapping concerns.

466
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,090
Well, uh, the lobby, the
parking garage, elevators...

467
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,230
all have video surveillance.

468
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,960
We have a doorman 24 hours a day.

469
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,740
Mm-hmm.

470
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,580
Um, sí... He wants to know the names

471
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,250
of other tenants on the
floor in the past 12 months

472
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,550
so a security team can
run background checks.

473
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,280
Uh, I'm not at liberty to
give out that information.

474
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,820
I'm sure that your client
would appreciate that.

475
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,360
My client likes to decide
what he would appreciate.

476
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,679
If you don't mind my asking,

477
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,270
what kind of business is your client in?

478
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,720
Hmm.

479
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,670
Construction, mainly.

480
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,140
He needs to be here a few
months out of the year.

481
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:57,589
He hates hotels.

482
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,280
Construction, mainly.

483
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,080
You know, other buildings we toured

484
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,490
had no problem disclosing
names of previous tenants.

485
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,990
The last one had a pool, too.

486
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,720
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

487
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,460
Eastwood Apartment's confidentiality policy

488
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,910
is very strict.

489
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:16,079
Good for you.

490
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,480
That's very commendable.

491
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,300
But my client is ready to pay a year's rent

492
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,400
for all three available
units on this floor by the end

493
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,740
of the week... and in cash,

494
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:29,610
but not unless he gets this information.

495
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,380
I see.

496
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,410
Let me talk to my boss
and I'll get back to you.

497
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,680
I'll give you 24 hours.

498
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,810
It's gonna be a hell of a storm.

499
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,560
Maybe God will send an ark

500
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,950
to take His faithful
away to somewhere else.

501
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,460
Amen, sister.

502
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,930
So...

503
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,900
you and Josh.

504
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,740
Me and Josh what?

505
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,150
Did you come up here to accuse me

506
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,980
of cheating on your son?

507
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:46,150
We both know there's no
PJ to cheat on anymore.

508
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,060
In mediation, you made it very clear...

509
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,090
I held the party line.

510
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,479
I have to.

511
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,100
Can't betray my husband in public.

512
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm on your side.

513
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,080
You can't get Pernell to understand?

514
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,720
I can't even get Pernell to eat.

515
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,760
Be patient.

516
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,500
He's gonna have to let PJ go eventually...

517
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,800
whether he wants to or not.

518
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,440
None of us want to.

519
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,710
He's already gone.

520
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,180
If there is a "you and Josh"

521
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,190
or a "you and anyone,"

522
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,160
you have my blessing.

523
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,330
There's none.

524
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,930
You have my encouragement.

525
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,700
Why are you telling me this?

526
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:12,670
Because no one is tying you
to that fiasco down there.

527
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,040
You're free, Jocelyn.

528
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,310
Go find an ark.

529
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,980
Get out of here. Go live your life.

530
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,990
And
with a storm on its way,

531
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,830
many of them are worried
about heavy rainfall,

532
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,660
rising tides, and high winds.

533
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,630
And places like the San Vicente harbor

534
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,200
haven't updated their pilings for decades.

535
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:43,549
So.

536
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,789
We just passed the two-hour mark,

537
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,959
if you're wondering.

538
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,010
Here you go.
- Thanks.

539
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,710
Welcome.

540
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,080
You don't have to stay.

541
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,610
Well, gonna at least finish my coffee.

542
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:01,190
I'm sorry I went off on
you like that earlier.

543
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:02,499
I just, um...

544
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,460
I have a friend who used to have a problem

545
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,760
with drugs that I really care about

546
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,300
and they're clean now,
praise God, but, um...

547
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:11,649
You're sensitive to it...

548
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,600
- I get it.
- Yeah.

549
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,050
I get it.

550
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,640
Yeah.

551
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,440
Um, Alicia.

552
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:21,689
Hmm?

553
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,089
I have your blood on my Jordans.

554
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,490
Can't we just cut

555
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,510
the "I have a friend" bullshit?

556
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,150
You talking about Paul, right?

557
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,850
No, no, not Paul.

558
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,320
Please, I've seen the way
the two of you are together.

559
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,290
The Reverend was an addict?

560
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,670
You know what drug dealers are famous for?

561
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,900
Discretion.

562
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,240
He relapsed.

563
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,580
Once, I think.

564
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,310
But he won't even admit it to me.

565
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,790
It's the lying that
really scares me, you know?

566
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,860
Yeah. What's his drug?

567
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:15,109
Meth.

568
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,160
Meth? Shit.

569
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,310
How do you know when someone's
not an addict anymore?

570
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,840
Well, once you're a pickle,

571
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,180
you can't go back to being a cucumber.

572
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,280
I don't believe that.

573
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,020
God transforms people.

574
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,720
I hope that's true.

575
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,260
Thank you.

576
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,340
Look at this.

577
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,370
Look at everything
you're doing for your boy.

578
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,820
Damn.

579
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,420
I know you're trying to be a good man,

580
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,390
trying to do the right thing,

581
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,930
but you're all fucking up
everything else along the way.

582
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,380
Bobo?

583
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,040
Who cleans it up?

584
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,710
You have no idea what I do,

585
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,020
what I let someone do
to me in front of my son.

586
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,470
My boy.

587
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,490
But it's fine, right, Pernell?

588
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,840
I'm gonna get that concrete pour.

589
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,110
Brooks is gonna move in.

590
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,640
And I'm gonna be the first black man

591
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,910
with a statue in front of the city hall.

592
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,830
Right?

593
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,080
"On the
shores of Gitche Gumee

594
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,910
of the shining Big-Sea-Water,

595
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,850
Stood Nokomis, the old woman,

596
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,850
pointing with her finger westward.

597
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,790
O'er the water pointing westward

598
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,890
to the purple clouds of sunset,

599
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,030
fiercely, the red sun descending,

600
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,300
burned his way along the heavens."

601
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,960
Lord, give strength to Your servant Pernell

602
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,200
in this, his time of need.

603
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,240
We know there is no burden so heavy

604
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,870
we cannot carry it if we
share the weight with You.

605
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,540
We ask these things in Your name.

606
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,990
Amen.

607
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,290
God...

608
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,580
I know You're here somewhere.

609
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,950
I can feel You.

610
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,190
Why won't You talk to me?

611
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,330
Why won't You let PJ talk to me?

612
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:24,010
I know I haven't been perfect.

613
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,550
But You said You didn't want perfect.

614
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,280
You said all we need to be is willing.

615
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,990
Haven't I been willing?

616
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,400
Eli Eli lama sabachthani.

617
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,530
Come closer.

618
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,840
PJ?

619
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,890
Pernell? What is it?

620
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,560
"As war-parties, when retreating,

621
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,930
Burn the prairies on their war-trail;

622
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,900
And the moon, the Night-sun, eastward,

Suddenly starting from his ambush... "

624
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,400
Close.

625
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,400
PJ?

626
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,310
"Followed
in that fiery war-trail

Pointing with her finger westward,

Spake these words to Hiawatha... "

631
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:35,529
Get outta here.

PJ.

639
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,540
Damn it, Pernell.

640
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:50,979
Can you please just let
us have this one thing?

641
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,379
Close.

00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,019
I'm close.

645
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,100
Talk to me, son.

646
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,210
The Devil is close.

647
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,980
- Hey!
- Where is he?

648
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,430
- Hey!
- Just tell me where he is?

649
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,250
- Everybody out.
- The Lord is speaking to him!

650
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,950
- Where is the devil?
- Hallelujah.

651

- Amen!
- Hallelujah!

- Come on, come on!
- The Lord is with him!

No, he's not, he's not...

654

- Hallelujah.
- Praise Jesus.

00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:23,049
- What?
- Listen, go home.

00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,179
You don't need to deal with this.

661
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,409
What are you talking about?

662
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,330
Let me take care of these assholes.

663
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,040
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay, fine.

664
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,800
You heard her. Get the fuck out.

665
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,540
Keep your promise.

666
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,980
- Hallelujah, Amen.
- Praise God!

667
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,780
Find the devil.

668
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:47,899
Who is he, PJ?

669
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,750
Praise Jesus.

670
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,160
- Who's the devil?
- You guys can't do this.

671
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,130
- Who are you pointing to?
- Back up.

672
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,830
- Come on.
- Who is it?

673
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,830
- Come on.
- Who's the devil?

674
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,700
Thank you, Jesus.

675
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,040
- What's going on here?
- Thank you, Jesus.

676
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,670
Hey, I want everybody out of here.

677
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,540
- I will find the devil...
- You're not part of the family,

678
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,510
- I want you out right now.
- And I will end him.

679
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,580
- Amen, Hallelujah!
- Amen, Hallelujah!

680
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,290
Hey, the nurse told me you were ready.

681
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,200
What happened?

682
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,370
Come on. You're scaring me.

683
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,800
Hey, they told me it
was only a few stitches.

684
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,780
You look like you just
found out you have cancer.

685
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:45,089
Hey.

686
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,050
I think Paul would make a wonderful father.

687
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,590
He's so patient with kids

688
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,520
and fun.

689
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,160
You should see how they gravitate to him.

690
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:03,100
One smile and they're hooked.

691
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,170
It's a gift, being good with kids.

692
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,119
Hey.

693
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,810
Paul doesn't need this right now,

694
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,850
especially with everything
that he's going through.

695
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,180
You know what? Maybe he does.

696
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,090
Maybe this can remind him of

697
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:31,290
what his priorities really need to be.

698
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,930
He can't deal with everything at once,

699
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,760
and this baby...

700
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,500
It's too much.

701
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,540
No. No, it's not.

702
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:50,310
He has you to keep him
focused and together.

703
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:51,559
And you can do that.

704
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,150
I know you can keep him together,

705
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,980
and you can do it.

706
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,120
- Hey.
- Hey.

707
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:58,469
You all right?

708
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,020
I'm fine.

709
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:01,199
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, what happened?

710
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,539
They said you fell.

711
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,760
I cut my finger and,
uh... when I saw the blood,

712
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,960
I passed out.

713
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:09,379
Yeah?

714
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,900
Yeah.

715
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,870
Let me see your work.

716
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,200
Okay, so, we're not gonna print all three.

717
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,400
Take the one I got.

718
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,340
Yeah, at the moment, no...

719
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,320
- Hi, Robert.
- Oh, I'm Robert now.

720
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,890
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor.

721
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:36,309
How about "Daddy"?

722
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,520
I like "Daddy."

723
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,490
I was
gonna come by your office,

724
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,330
but since you're here, I'll do it now.

725
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,000
I want to apologize. I'm not a racist.

726
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:50,319
I'm not a nigger.

727
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,740
I know, I
never thought it would...

728
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,210
I just wanted you to admit there's a line.

729
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,180
What people say matters.

730
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,350
More than what they do?

731
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,980
Anyway, I'm sorry.

732
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,720
Why now?

733
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,690
I was sorry the second I said it.

734
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,990
No, no, you're telling me now because...

735
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,790
The city auditor called you, right?

736
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,560
I can't open my books
to an audit right now.

737
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,100
Yeah, I thought that might be a problem.

738
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,730
The more I looked into your
Schoolyard Improvement Fund,

739
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,430
the more it smelled like a slush fund.

740
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,440
It's a real account.

741
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,940
You know, I could explain it,

742
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,410
but it's not worth the blowback.

743
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:34,050
Look, I'll approve the grid expansion

744
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,250
for the Brooks Headquarters.

745
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,920
Please, Robert, call it off.

746
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,650
Please who?

747
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,030
Please... Daddy.

748
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,410
You can go now.

749
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,380
See what I mean?

750
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,020
You call that a win?

751
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:13,369
♪ Oh, freedom ♪

752
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,020
I'm going to the car.

753
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,620
So...

754
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,590
the preacher is a drug addict.

755
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,330
Recovering addict.

756
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,170
He's just addicted to God now.

757
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,170
Say you take down this preacher.

758
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,310
What makes you think that
Pernell's not gonna just find

759
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,340
somebody else to latch onto?

760
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,010
One problem at a time, please.

761
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:19,469
Huh?

762
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:22,550
Hey. What about that chick?

763
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,190
The one that's always with him?

764
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,530
Alicia.

765
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,000
Anything about her I can use on him?

766
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,910
Nothing. She's...

767
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,980
pretty vanilla.

768
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,480
Keep looking.

769
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,780
Ciao, Bella.

770
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,400
Just because we can't stay
here doesn't mean we can't pray.

771
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,470
We'll go back to the church and keep going.

772
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,870
Thank you, Paul, but, uh...

773
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,570
Now that God is talking to
me again, I'm not worried.

774
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,170
I know He'll show me the way.

775
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,970
Amen.

776
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,610
Oh, hey, you can spare
one of these, can't you?

777
00:44:19,611 --> 00:44:20,899
I haven't eaten in two days.

778
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,450
No, you don't want to start with these.

779
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,380
They're for patients who can't take pills.

780
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:25,830
There's meds mixed in.

781
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,070
Turn to Luke 8:23-25.

782
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,540
"And as they sailed, he fell asleep.

783
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,910
And a windstorm came down on the lake

784
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,550
and they were filling with
water, and were in danger.

785
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,150
And they went and woke him,

786
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,690
saying, 'Master,
master, we are perishing.'

787
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,920
And he awoke and rebuked the wind

788
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,160
and the raging waves and they ceased

789
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,060
and it was calm.

790
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:49,570
And he turned to them and
said, 'Where is your faith?'"

791
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,540
I know.

792
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:55,640
Hey, everybody gather around.

793
00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:00,510
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah, "Uh-oh" is right.

794
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,580
- Time for the bubbly.
- The good stuff.

795
00:46:03,581 --> 00:46:04,969
All right.

796
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,890
This is my dad's favorite party trick...

797
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,560
mainly 'cause everyone thinks he's crazy

798
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,530
before they figure out he's a genius.

799
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,260
Oh!

800
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,700
Come on!

801
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,160
You get that?

802
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,800
- Will you pass me a cup.
- Oh, my G...

803
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,910
Hey.

804
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,650
Hey.

805
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,520
Come.

806
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,860
Sit with me.

807
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,760
We're doing better now.

808
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,660
Better than we've been in a long time.

809
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,370
How would I know?

810
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,940
27 years.

811
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,170
Ups, downs... you should know.

812
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,580
I didn't drug you.

813
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:43,829
I...

814
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,820
Gave you your medicine.

815
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,790
You tried to take the thing I needed most.

816
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,240
No.

817
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,700
I tried to help you.

818
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,370
I wanted you back.

819
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,870
You did it all for me.

820
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,410
For us.

821
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,080
Because I love you.

822
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:19,350
Well, I hope so.

823
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,120
Because that's what I'm
going to tell myself.

824
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:35,930
A storm is coming, a storm is coming.

825
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,900
Trees will fall and block our way.

826
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,740
Cell towers will explode
and cut off contact

827
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:41,159
from our loved ones.

828
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,740
- That's right.
- Cars will smash

829
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,710
into each other and blood will pour

830
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,680
from the cracks and we'll still get by.

831
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,480
- Yes.
- Yes we will.

832
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,050
But it's not the damage
from the storm that mattered.

833
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,420
It's the clarity that
comes with the cleansing.

834
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,660
It's what clears away
the wreckage of our lives

835
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,720
that's important. Can I get an amen?

836
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,320
Amen!

837
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,860
If you turn your life
to Jesus with open arms,

838
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,660
He is there...
- I'm so glad you could make it.

839
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,130
And He is waiting for you,

840
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,770
and He will make your life better.

841
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,220
Do not give up!

842
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:19,629
Mm.

843
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,729
Hey.

844
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,680
You doing okay? You look beat.

845
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:26,450
Mm. Been a long day.

846
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,590
But it just got better.

847
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,520
Thanks for braving the storm.

848
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,020
You said it was important.

849
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,390
You know what I'm gonna do
when this is all over with?

850
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,760
When PJ wakes up.

851
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,830
I'm gonna take you on a trip.

852
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,970
Some place you've never been before.

853
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:44,019
Uh-huh.

854
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,710
Proper honeymoon.

855
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,870
I do weekend getaways.

856
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,780
Business trips.

857
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:53,280
I don't do honeymoons.

858
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,459
Didn't that change?

859
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,020
Now that we're married?

860
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,550
I'm not your wife, Pernell.

861
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,790
Look, my last name isn't Harris.

862
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,760
I don't have keys to your house.

863
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,690
I'm not your emergency contact.

864
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,690
I am not your wife.

865
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,270
Okay.

866
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,280
Just so long as you know I love you.

867
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,030
I do know that.

868
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,760
This is the Eastwood Apartment tenant list

869
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:44,400
for the last 12 months.

870
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,470
I already looked through it.
I only recognized one name.

871
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,040
So what can you see more clearly

872
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:57,340
now that God has washed
the land clean for us?

873
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,780
And more importantly, what
are you gonna do about it

874
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,450
now that you can see?

875
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,970
God...

876
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,810
And of course I left my umbrella at home.

877
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,940
Oh, God.

878
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:37,120
On the bright side, the
prayer warriors are...

879
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,320
What's wrong?

880
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:07,180
Wait. Wait, hold on.

881
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,620
You don't have to feel guilty.

882
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,250
Really?

883
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,260
I want to.

884
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,520
It's not that.

885
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,560
I just want us to be sure.

886
00:53:00,737 --> 00:53:03,329
