2
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,607
Keep your hand on this and
remember the deceased.

3
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,289
Hello. (Namaskar)

4
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,669
Shave to the left.
Don't move, Mahadev.

5
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,902
Now change the side of
the sacred thread.

6
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,401
Repeat the chants after me.
(Sanskrit Chants).

7
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:10,912
"The Sun has risen."

8
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,708
"Narayan" (The Sun).

9
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:24,471
"The red and orange
rays of the sun."

10
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:33,693
"My friend, Radhika.."

11
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,088
"The orange rays.."

12
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:53,122
"The Champa blossom
in the courtyard."

13
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,549
Mahadev! Leave that to the women.

14
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,965
We have to exercise.
-"The Sun has risen."

15
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,558
"Narayan!"

16
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:15,610
"It brightens the whole world."

17
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,070
Go in.. completely into the water.

18
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,907
Nothing will happen.
-"The Sun has risen."

19
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,455
"Narayan." -Move your legs. Yes.

20
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:28,993
Perfect.

21
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:34,086
"It brightens the whole world."
-Put some effort into it.

22
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:34,999
Still more.

23
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,253
All of the Ranade family
and their relatives..

24
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,050
..all present here should
pay their..

25
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,513
..respect to the deceased
and pray.

26
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,800
Now offer this 'Pind' (A mound
of cooked rice used..

27
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,552
..in perfroming the last
rites) to the crows.

28
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,821
Mahadev

29
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,207
Mahadev

30
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,244
Mahadev

31
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,046
Balwant.. -Yes.

32
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,748
Where did you see him?

33
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,213
While coming I saw him here.

34
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,761
I asked him what he
was doing here..

35
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,971
..he said nothing and ran away.

36
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,931
Mahadeva

37
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,848
Mahadeva

38
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,064
Mahadev

39
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,109
Yes, brother! -See..

40
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,069
Where are you?

41
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,905
Up here on the tree.

42
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,904
What are you doing there?

43
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,366
Studying.

44
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,951
Up there?

45
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,081
Where else?

46
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,372
At home Shanti and Kushi
trouble me a lot.

47
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,165
I can't concentrate.

48
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,299
Okay. Come down and let's go home.
We must leave for Mandavi.

49
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,342
But brother,
I haven't finished studying.

50
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,218
I wasn't planning to take you.

51
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:14,224
But today girls and boys must
meet before they marry.

52
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,846
That's why I say come with me.

53
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,187
But brother, I don't want
to get married so soon.

54
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,777
We're leaving in half an hour.
Be ready.

55
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,362
But.. -Balwant, let's go.

56
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,320
Are we there? -Yes.
Straight ahead.

57
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,120
Once we climb those steps
we will be there.

58
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,073
Stop near that tree. -Okay.

59
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,331
Yesterday Balwant told me..

60
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,664
..your child is the ideal
bride for Mahadev.

61
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,134
And Mahadev is leaving
for Mumbai tomorrow.

62
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,005
That's why we had to fix
everything in a rush.

63
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,844
Never mind.

64
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,218
Destiny has brought us together
that is important. -Right.

65
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,017
Okay. Shall I call my daughter?

66
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,898
Yes, please -Call her.

67
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,311
Careful..

68
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,756
If you have something to ask her,
go ahead.

69
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,561
Hari.

70
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,275
Hari! Ask her.

71
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,146
What's your name, child?

72
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,273
Durga.

73
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,649
Durga means?

74
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,913
Mahadev marrying Parvati..

75
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,990
..is like the celestial couple.

76
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,247
Well? What do you think?

77
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,878
Very well.

78
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,749
Do you go to school?

79
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,375
Yes.

80
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,630
Ok, tell me..

81
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,385
Take five sacks of wheat
and five of rice..

82
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,133
..is equal to how much?

83
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,181
Answer.

84
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,230
Zero.

85
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,894
Zero?

86
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,312
How is that?

87
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,989
Those 10 kilos will yield
neither rice nor bread.

88
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,527
Adding them together
equals nothing.

89
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,004
What else do you know?

90
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,373
She is learning music.

91
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,166
Really? -Yes.

92
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,046
Will you sing for us?

93
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,755
My master has taught me an 'ovi' (0vi is a
song sung while doing the house hold chores).

94
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,676
Shall I sing that?

95
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,265
Go ahead.

96
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,101
Do you know how to play
the harmonium?

97
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,146
Harmonium?

98
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,107
Child! Sing without music.

99
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,567
Okay.

100
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:16,281
"The maried life.."

101
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,827
"Is like a pan on a burning fire."

102
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,035
"Only by singeing your fingers.."

103
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:30,003
"..can you bake bread."

104
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:35,718
"Oh, married life!"

105
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:42,723
Wonderful

106
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,679
She has a beautiful voice.

107
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,359
She may go.
We've nothing more to ask.

108
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,480
Durga,
pay your respects to everyone.

109
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,326
I seek your blessings.

110
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,034
The girl's intelligent.

111
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,539
She has studied till class 4.

112
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,080
Well read and cultured as well.

113
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,798
And yes. Durga has grown
in front of my eyes.

114
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,346
She was raised with pure values
and has no flaws. Right?

115
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,926
We like her.

116
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,854
What about the dowry?

117
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,897
Leave that to Balwant.

118
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,444
Balwant, what do you say?

119
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,316
As he is the mediater we will
abide by whatever he says.

120
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,609
That's okay.

121
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,948
But according to tradition
everything..

122
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,070
..should be written down..

123
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,122
..and should be signed
by the elderly..

124
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,498
"people from both the families.

125
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,494
Priest,
I don't think that's necessary.

126
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,423
We'll meet again -Okay.

127
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,712
Good-bye. -Good-bye. -Good-bye.

128
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:56,877
Good-bye.

129
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,183
I will see you soon -Okay.
Narharpant, we are leaving.

130
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,393
Go and drop the guests.
-Yes. Bhaskar, I'll just be back.

131
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,307
Bye, uncle. -Everything went well.

132
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,640
Here.

133
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,359
Mother, may I remove my nose ring?
-Yes.

134
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,570
Oh! -Wait.

135
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,364
My burden is lightened.

136
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,163
They have approved of the girl.

137
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,372
And why not?

138
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,493
My Durga has no flaw.

139
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,708
Durga, did you like Mahadev?

140
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,427
He's doing his BA in Mumbai.
He'll study law later.

141
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,431
He looks a sissy.
My sister is too good for him.

142
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,394
Not at all.

143
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,392
He Cofhll'lalldS respect.

144
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,475
His moustache suits him.

145
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,615
The groom has no moustache.

146
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,451
Who did you see?

147
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,405
The man with a lovely turban.

148
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,414
Turban?

149
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,035
The one who was sitting
next to uncle Balwant.

150
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,413
I asked him about the harmonium.

151
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,632
That was Mahadev's elder brother,
Haridada.

152
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,464
Why didn't the groom come?

153
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,880
Oh God! -Look at her.

154
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,471
Does that mean you never
saw the groom?

155
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,225
He was right here in front of you.

156
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,766
Wearing a black coat and hat.

157
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,442
I didn't notice him.

158
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,570
Run and see if they're
still near.

159
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,029
Se him if they have not left.

160
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,907
Hurry! Go -Hurry up.

161
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,574
They are wonderful people.

162
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,698
I know them for years.

163
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,783
A very nice family. -Yes.

164
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,165
Mahadev, we have finished an
important task, isn't it?

165
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,379
Balwant, who was that sullen
man next to Narharpant?

166
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,921
That was the bride's
maternal uncle.

167
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,929
Let's hope he cheers up soon?

168
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,301
Isn't it?

169
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,524
I asked him if he liked the girl.

170
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,519
He was so embarrassed.

171
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,486
And he immediately looked down.

172
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,490
And then he was quietly
looking at her.

173
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:29,368
Mahadev, what is brother saying?
You were looking at the girl.

174
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,655
I wasn't ogling.

175
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,491
What do you call it then?

176
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,250
Being sly?

177
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,001
Never mind about Mahadev.

178
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,047
Hari too didn't stop staring
at her either.

179
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,505
What no?
Instead of asking questions..

180
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,465
..he kept staring at her.

181
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,964
Brother-in-law,
what are you saying?

182
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,553
I was joking, sister-in-law.

183
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,601
Don't joke about such things.

184
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,354
You're a close friend,
so he humours you.

185
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,523
But othenuise if anyone
would have said such..

186
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,234
..things about him he wouldn't
have tolerated.

187
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,979
Enough! How much will talk?

188
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,157
Mahadev, will you be able to wait
till the month of December?

189
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,574
It's inauspicious to marry now.

190
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,368
I'm in no hurry. -Fine.

191
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,534
Actually I did not want
to get marreid so soon.

192
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,619
I want to study law.

193
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,545
A lawyer in the family
will help us.

194
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,214
There are many unsettled
land disputes.

195
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,878
So then..

196
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,759
Why take on a new burden?

197
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,764
Okay. So are you saying you don't
want to marry so soon?

198
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,637
Yes. I mean.. -Okay.

199
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,974
Balwant, tell her parents
the marriage is off.

200
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,567
Okay.
-When did I say no to marriage?

201
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,571
Brother! -Hari!

202
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:50,569
He doesn't say yes.
He doesn't say no.

203
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,616
Aunt, that's not it.

204
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,244
But brother, what about my
wedding? My vacation is over.

205
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,209
Who's asking you to stay here?

206
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,294
Leave tomorrow for
Mumbai as planned.

207
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,419
Make sure you're back
on your wedding day.

208
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,591
Priest, can you propose
an auspicious date?

209
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,686
The tenth of next month
is an auspicious date.

210
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,306
It is the full moon day.

211
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,603
It's an auspicious day -Yes.

212
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,440
What's wrong then?

213
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,612
Their horoscopes also do match.

214
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,701
But..I need time to study
the bride's chart.

215
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,153
A few of her planets
are not aligned.

216
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,161
It's puzzling me.

217
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,707
Fine, you study.
But find an auspicious day soon.

218
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,296
Okay. -Is Haridada home?

219
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,337
Namya, come in.

220
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,256
What is it?

221
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,628
I have come from the priest.

222
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,347
He has called you at
uncle Sada's house.

223
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,099
Okay?

224
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,968
What has happened now?

225
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,430
Actually the thing
is the Goddess'

226
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,973
festival is fast approaching.

227
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:07,650
And I don't understand
how to go about it.

228
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,981
What is it that you
can't understand?

229
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,863
My rights of that ritual
are with my family.

230
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,655
And this year it is my uncle
Sadashiv's turn to do it.

231
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,326
You are right..

232
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:23,162
But Sadashivrao has been bed
ridden for over six months.

233
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,704
My uncle's son..

234
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,674
_.my cousin, Govardhan can take
on the responsibility instead of him.

235
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,418
Brother, where did I deny that?

236
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,467
I just want to say that
I will not sacrifice..

237
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,802
..a buffalo for the Goddess.

238
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,683
The Goddess demands it.

239
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,854
Slaying a buffalo is slaying
the devil, Mahishasur.

240
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,689
The Goddess's brow has to
be anointed by its blood.

241
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,816
I don't believe it.

242
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,773
Aunt Namu,
slaying a helpless animal in..

243
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,688
..front of the Goddess
is not religion.

244
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,569
The Goddess demands blood.

245
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,404
Who decided that?
We did, isn't it?

246
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,575
Govardhan,
it's an important ritual.

247
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:58,784
Fine.

248
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,745
If that ritual is so important
then I'll replace the buffalo..

249
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,993
..with a buffalo made of clay
and perform ther ritual.

250
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,495
Yes! -Yes!

251
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,838
How can you agree with him?
Will that do?

252
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,754
It is written in the
Holy Scriptures.

253
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,465
Instead of a wife we make do
with a betel nut while..

254
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,258
..performing the Satyanarayan
Veneration, isn't it?

255
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,259
Your obstinacy will lose you the
right to perform the ritual.

256
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,262
Hari,
why don't you do it instead..

257
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,852
..of our family losing this right?

258
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,024
No. That is not right.

259
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,735
I cannot rob my uncle Sadashiv
of his rights.

260
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,696
So how will you find
a way out of this?

261
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,116
If the festival is not
celebrated properly..

262
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,862
..the villagers will get angry.
-Hari, you must decide now.

263
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,831
The villagers will abide
by your decision.

264
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,537
Definitely. -Yes. Yes.

265
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,871
I agree with what Govardhan says.

266
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,210
You agree to his childishness?

267
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,836
Yes.

268
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,755
He is right.

269
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,422
Henceforth I will also not
sacrifice an animal.

270
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,723
A clay buffalo makes
more sense to me.

271
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,231
Your decision will anger the
Goddess, remember that.

272
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,235
The villagers should speak if
they do not agree with me.

273
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,231
We are sure that Haridada will
not decide without thought.

274
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,778
Truly spoken.

275
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,404
It's settled then.

276
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,153
I shan't be insulted further.

277
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,788
Let's go now. -Let's go. -This
is leading to a disaster.

278
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,374
Do whatever untoward
you feel like.

279
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,284
The chief is being illogical.

280
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,414
Hari, we have a family wedding.

281
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,798
Don't rouse the Chiefs enmity,
Hari.

282
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,380
Don't worry, Namuatya.

283
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,798
I shan't let anything spoil
Mahadev's wedding.

284
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,818
Yes, priest. -Hello.

285
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,869
Why is your friend Balwant
harassing me?

286
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,329
What has he done?

287
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,749
Why are his men watching
my house all the time?

288
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,417
Why would Balwant do that?

289
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,329
Don't pretend you don't know.

290
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,833
Tell him and his thugs to stop.

291
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,585
Or else the consequences
will be bad.

292
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,590
Balwant's friends are no thugs.

293
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,885
They have left their
homes to fight..

294
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,132
..for our country's Independence.

295
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,222
They're freedom fighters
who won't..

296
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,310
..look back to sacrifice
ther life.

297
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,773
Ask them to watch the homes
of the British. Why mine?

298
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,144
Tell me, why?

299
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,778
The British pay you for the
information you give them.

300
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,443
Why would I do that?

301
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:38,989
God knows.

302
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,402
I would like to tell you one more
thing for your information.

303
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,872
The Brahmins are going to give
a second thought for the..

304
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,834
"support you have given for
not sacrificing a buffalo.

305
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,999
Your uncle Sadashive wll no doubt
lose his rights this year..

306
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,251
..and your family will
also lose the right..

307
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,592
..to perform the rituals forever.

308
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,389
If that happens it will be very
unfortunate. -I can fix it.

309
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,884
Tell Balwant to shop. I will see
that you are not at a loss.

310
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,766
You mean I'd lose the offerings
people give to the Goddess?

311
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,188
I don't care about that.

312
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,945
I have never viewed
it as our right.

313
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,906
I only thought of it as a way
of serving the Goddess.

314
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,487
Balwant did nothing wrong.

315
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,288
Not slaying the buffalo was right.
So I supported it.

316
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,669
Both these things are unrelated.

317
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,088
And I won't make deals with
you regarding that.

318
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,467
Do as you please.

319
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,924
Forget about it, Balwant.
-No, but Hari whatever you say..

320
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,931
I never thought that the
priest would stop..

321
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,724
_.you in your path
and threaten you.

322
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,353
We must find a way to silence him.

323
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,894
I Think you better stay out of it.

324
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:03,108
He is powerful and has close
ties with local politicians.

325
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,075
I'll handle it.

326
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,033
But now I had another
work with you.

327
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,206
You ask now?
Not earlier? So you need money..

328
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,920
..and you are hesitating to ask,
right?

329
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,048
With friends like you..

330
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,964
..our struggle for Independence
would be easy.

331
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,926
Mahatma Gandhi is goign to go on
a salt satyagraha next month.

332
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,137
And I wish to participate
in that protest.

333
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,060
So why do you need money?

334
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,938
To buy parts for a pistol.

335
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,442
A pistol and satyagraha together?

336
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,894
How can they go together?

337
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,402
I must be prepared in case
the British use violence.

338
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,991
Balwant,
this time I'm short of cash.

339
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,991
Mahadev's education in Mumbai is
expensive and besides that..

340
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,749
But I will try. -No. Never mind.

341
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,962
You've already done
so much for me.

342
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,957
No, it is not like that.
I'll think it over.

343
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,469
Wait till Mahadev's
wedding is over.

344
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,005
Have you found a date, Priest?

345
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,728
The third of next month
is auspicious.

346
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,138
Lovely!

347
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,815
Is that all right?

348
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,979
There's little time left.

349
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,989
I had better inform the bride's
family immediately.

350
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,282
They'll also need time to prepare.

351
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:33,999
Make sure you come here after
Gandhi's Salt March.

352
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,248
After that for a month till
Mahadev's wedding is over..

353
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,205
..you must think of nothing else.

354
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,050
The country's independence
can wait for a month.

355
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,169
Understood? -Yes.

356
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,022
Come. Please come.

357
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,026
Wedding chants Sanskrit.

358
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,714
"uma"

359
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,590
Don't cry, my child.

360
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,632
Be happy -Father.

361
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,526
Step in.

362
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,698
Welcome.

363
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:35,995
WPI?

364
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,911
Will you let your daughter marry
the son I'm carrying?

365
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,161
Yes.

366
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,788
Take your husband's name.

367
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:46,623
She is taking his name.

368
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,211
I offer the Bilva leaf
to Lord Shiva.

369
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,263
In speaking Mahadev's name,
I bow in respect.

370
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,099
Can you say his name
in another way?

371
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,136
I had memorised only one.

372
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,764
Okay. Let's go.

373
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,187
Pay your respects to Aunt Namu.
-Come here.

374
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,355
Be seated everyone.

375
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,772
Mahadev, what name did you
chose for your bride?

376
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,190
Uma.

377
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,157
Beautiful name.

378
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,409
He's smart, aunt Nam...

379
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,493
Uma is another name for
Durga and Parvati.

380
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,204
Hari, the girl is very virtuous.

381
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,924
Her second toe is bigger
than her thumb toe.

382
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,711
Why look at her feet?

383
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:37,181
We will see her face all the time.

384
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,141
Details are more important.

385
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:44,139
If you're done examining her,
bless them so they can go.

386
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,560
What use are my blessings?
Who cares about me?

387
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,611
Come on. -Forget it.

388
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,114
Don't pay attention to her.

389
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,196
She might sound rude but
she is kind hearted.

390
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,948
Let's go inside.

391
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,700
Pay your respects to God.

392
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,668
Don't do it. What are you doing?

393
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,424
What are you doing?

394
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,382
No! Don't trouble me.

395
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,806
Wait.. -Let me go, aunt.

396
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,928
What is it? -Let me go, aunt.
Let me go.

397
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,563
Why should I? -Let me go, aunt!
-I ill not leave you.

398
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,477
-Why do you do this?

399
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,308
Nowadays you trouble me a lot.
-Aunt, let me go.

400
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,148
Let me go -No, I won't.
You trouble me a lot. -Aunt..

401
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,321
Aunt, your hands are so soft.

402
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,611
Grandma Namu says women should
not have soft hands.

403
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,120
Why not?

404
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,707
Soft hands cannot do
household chores.

405
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,544
Not true.

406
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,547
Soft-handed people are..

407
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:57,261
_.sensitive and kind at heart.

408
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:02,050
Uncle, why do you come between
we girls? -Why?

409
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,051
Why are you here with us girls?

410
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,601
Me? Mother is calling you.

411
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,807
I didn't hear her call.

412
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,651
That's because she sent me. Go.

413
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,895
What is this? Uncle, you ogler.

414
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,814
You, wait.

415
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,279
Please don't go. -Why?

416
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,278
Why means..

417
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,240
See! The mango tree bears bananas.

418
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,294
Right there. -Where?

419
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,330
What is this?

420
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,299
Why don't you let me touch
your soft hands?

421
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:38,295
Let go.
Or else I'll call sister-in-law.

422
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,968
Why call her between us?

423
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,136
I'm going to leave for
Mumbai tomorrow.

424
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,683
Let me hold your hand
for sometime.

425
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,847
No. Leave my hand.

426
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,974
No, I won't. -I said, let go!

427
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:48,971
I said no.

428
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,270
Sister-in-law! -But..

429
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,272
What's wrong. Sister-in-law?

430
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,270
Nothing. Ask him.

431
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,941
Brother-in-law,
what happened to her?

432
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,111
Nothing, sister-in-law.

433
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,740
She got frightened I think.

434
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,452
Maybe she saw a rat.

435
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,247
Yes! It must be that.

436
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,623
What do you mean?
It really did happen.

437
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,125
Come and have your dinner.

438
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,165
You have to leave for Mumbai
early tomorrow, isn't it?

439
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,375
That's right, sister-in-law.

440
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,798
Very early in the morning.

441
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,096
Brother-in-law..

442
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,387
..make sure you take the jack
fruit while going tomorrow.

443
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,852
Sister-in-law,
none of them are ripe.

444
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,313
You know we don't eat raw fruit,
isn't it?

445
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,099
Yes.

446
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,192
Good. So you understand.

447
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,360
Meaning?

448
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,070
Sister-in-law is still very young.

449
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,740
She won't understand
your love yet.

450
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,529
You can start your married life
once she reaches puberty.

451
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,665
Come.

452
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,374
Let's pack your bags. Come.

453
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,713
Meddlesome girl! -What happened?

454
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,423
Nothing, sister-in-law.
I'm coming.

455
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,507
Mahadev, don't forget to
send us a letter. -Yes.

456
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,391
Keep it properly.

457
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,389
Where is Kushi? -She's asleep.

458
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,059
Is that so? -Yes.
-Don't bother your mother, okay?

459
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,101
Here.

460
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,655
So many bags?
Aren't you returning in two weeks?

461
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,570
I can't think of returning
till my exams are over.

462
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,202
The moment you get my letter
brother-in-law Iwave immediately.

463
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,655
And brother-in-law..

464
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,828
..are you sure you won't
take the jack fruit?

465
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,367
Sister-in-law..

466
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,868
What is this about the jack fruit?

467
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,709
That's a secret between us.

468
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,591
Okay, sister-in-law..

469
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,838
_.take this.
Give this book to Uma to read.

470
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,676
Which book is it?

471
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,008
Only illustrations?

472
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,017
It's a cartoon book.

473
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,389
Last month it got published
in the west.

474
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,856
What's it about?

475
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,354
It's about a mouse called Mickey..

476
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,148
..who talks like human beings..

477
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:01,900
That's what is shown in this book.

478
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,693
Oh, my God!

479
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,816
That means a mouse
talks like a man.

480
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,490
Then do men squeak like mice?

481
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,245
Enough! Don't waste time talking.

482
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,164
Let's go.
The boat doesn't belong to us.

483
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,627
It will leave without you.
-Yes. -Let's go.

484
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,917
Sister-in-law,
I seek your blessings. -Yes.

485
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,961
Aunt, give me your blessings.
... May you have a long life!

486
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,129
Careful.
And take care of yourself.

487
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,466
-Take care and go safely. -Okay.

488
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,443
Let's go inside.

489
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,986
Come on all of you in.

490
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,567
Aunt, may I have a look?

491
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,784
Hari, how long before Mahadev
becomes a lawyer?

492
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,819
This is his last year.

493
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,451
The wedding went well.
-It's all thanks to God.

494
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,750
You had warned me not to go
anywhere from the wedding pandal.

495
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,840
So a very important job
is left to finish.

496
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,084
I will have to finish that first.

497
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,510
What is it?

498
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,155
You scoundrel!

499
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,789
You deserve this.

500
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,602
Priest! Did someone attack you?

501
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,856
Show your face, if you dare.

502
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,529
Priest, are you all right?

503
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,572
I'll break your legs. Confront me.

504
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,578
Are you fine?

505
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,450
What is it?

506
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,545
I lost this blanket yesterday.
Thanks to you, I found it.

507
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,254
Are you all right?
Shall I accompany you home?

508
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,589
Take care.

509
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,554
Have you no shame to
attack from behind?

510
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,641
Confront me. -Balwant,
I won't spare you, remember that.

511
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,819
The scoundrel broke my bones.

512
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,486
What happens next?
-Wait, I'll tell you.

513
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,289
Aunt, how long you take?
Are you sure you can read?

514
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,582
Be quiet.

515
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,627
Well..

516
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,503
Mickey the Mouse meets..

517
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,589
..his friend Goofy.

518
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,965
A dog.

519
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,631
A mouse and a dog?
Friends? -Sure, it's possible.

520
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,594
You keep quiet.

521
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,631
Listen. -Nonsense!
What kind of book is this?

522
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,891
See, Kushi has fallen asleep.

523
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,804
If a bedtime story won't put
you to sleep, what will?

524
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,605
But you are not sleeping.

525
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:24,978
What can I do?

526
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,768
I can't sleep.

527
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,396
Shall I tell you another story?

528
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,193
No. Absolutely not.

529
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:33,903
Then what should I do?

530
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,527
Sing me a song.

531
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,620
Then lie down first.

532
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:48,506
"Sleep, my dear princess."

533
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:52,881
"May you go to sleep."

534
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:59,930
"There is a beautiful hammock
tied up for you."

535
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:04,681
"It sways gradually and
puts you to sleep."

536
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,068
Sister-in-law, give me some water.

537
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,654
Kushi, give her water.

538
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:24,208
What were you three doing
so late last night?

539
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,120
Nothing.
I was telling them a story.

540
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,666
Don't make it a habit.

541
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,580
They'll trouble you every night.

542
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,712
I don't mind if they do.

543
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,676
I'll tell them a story
every night. -Com on.

544
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,466
Take off your nose ring.

545
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,814
Aunt Uma? Aunt Uma!

546
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,858
Mother, where's aunt Uma?

547
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,701
What is it? What do you want?

548
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,282
I want my hair braided.

549
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,030
Wait. I'll do it for you.

550
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,662
No, not you.
Aunt Uma does it better.

551
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,836
I've done it all these years.
Where was she then?

552
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,299
Oh dear! Sister-in-law, come soon.
-Did Uma fall??

553
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,961
Sister-in-law, hurry up!

554
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,721
You wait here.

555
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,809
Oh, my God! -What must have
happeend to aunt Uma? -I don't know.

556
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:25,393
-Sister-in-law..

557
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,729
See what has happened?
-Nothing's wrong with you.

558
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,689
Everything is fine. -Don't worry.

559
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,811
What's wrong, mother?
-Play over there. Go.

560
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:40,322
Aunt Namu!
Aunt Namu! Come quickly.

561
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,708
Did you hear? -Tell me.

562
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,919
We must call the priest. -Okay.

563
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,338
Don't you want to know why?

564
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,932
Why?

565
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,768
For the Falashodan ceremony.
Uma has reached puberty.

566
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,262
All right.

567
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,433
You mean.. really? -Yes.

568
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,767
When? -This morning.

569
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,770
We must make the preparations now.

570
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,522
I've told everyone.

571
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,316
We'll hold the ceremony
after four days.

572
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,071
I'll write to Mahadev immediately.

573
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,239
I'm sure he isn't paying attention
to his studies anyway.

574
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,122
Tell him the fruit is ripe.

575
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,370
He'll rush back.

576
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,664
Fruit? What's this nonsense?

577
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,086
That's between us.

578
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,754
So be it.

579
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:39,461
Old memories flood back at
times like this, isn't it?

580
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,303
Meaning?

581
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,556
I mean.. -I have a lot of
work to do. Let me go.

582
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,034
"A woman's life.."

583
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,788
"..has many faces."

584
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:14,704
"She is both mother and sister."

585
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,880
"A woman's life.."

586
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,878
"..has many faces."

587
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,759
"She is both mother and sister."

588
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:49,159
"She resembles a little doll.."

589
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:54,539
"She resembles a little doll."

590
00:36:54,879 --> 00:37:04,880
"Now she's blossomed
like a jasmine."

591
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,885
"Spreading the fragrance
of Jasmine."

592
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:17,316
"A woman's life has many faces."

593
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:22,647
"She is both a mother
and a sister."

594
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:41,374
"How do I explain what
has happened?"

595
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:46,383
"You are a woman now."

596
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:51,888
"Only a mother can explain
the meaning of affection."

597
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:56,560
"Only a mother can explain
the meaning of affection."

598
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:01,731
"A woman's life has many faces."

599
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:07,074
"A woman's life has many faces."

600
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,909
"Both a mother.. -Haridada,
the celebration is going on well.

601
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,912
The women are overjoyed.

602
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,449
Sit down please.

603
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,916
I have brought milk. -Yes.

604
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,711
Priest, you were supposed to
tell me the auspicious..

605
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,713
..date for the Falashodhan
ceremony. -Yes.

606
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,171
The fourth of next month
is very auspicious.

607
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,305
Great! Let's hope Mahadev's exams
don't come in the way. -Yes.

608
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,142
Dear, Mahadev, blessings
from everyone here.

609
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:42,776
I am writing this letter to
tell you that your wife..

610
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,019
..Uma is now a woman.

611
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,196
Everybody here misses you.

612
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,319
The Falshodhan ceremony..

613
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,904
..will be held after three days.

614
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,035
So you must leave
for home at once.

615
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,793
Good evening, Mr. Mahadev.
What news? Shall I come in?

616
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:01,958
Sir, please come in.

617
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,001
What brings you here, sir?
-Your last month rent is due.

618
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,550
Yes, sir. I have kept the money
ready. I'll go and get it.

619
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,520
What is he studying?

620
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,976
The Falashodhan ceremony
is in 8 days.

621
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,527
Your sister-in-law says
'The fruit is ripe'..

622
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,281
Okay. -Sir, don't read my letter.

623
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,776
Why are you so embarrassed?
It's good news.

624
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,320
Yes, sir.

625
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,999
Start exercising and drink
almond milk every night.

626
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,376
Why?

627
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,246
You must impress your wife
on the first night.

628
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,005
Sir.. -Power! Power!

629
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,674
Congratulations, young man.
Congratulations!

630
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,212
Thank you, sir.
-You're warm in anticipation.

631
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,846
No, sir. I have slight fever.

632
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,223
I am unwell.

633
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,804
What are you doing here?

634
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,476
Better see a doctor immediately.

635
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,020
But sir, your money..

636
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,057
Money can wait, young man.
Money can wait.

637
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,144
But I can't.

638
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,989
Jaanu? Here today at the port?

639
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,867
Brother Mahadev is coming
today from Mumbai.

640
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,660
For the ceremony.

641
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,500
Haridada invited me.
-Do come. -Yes.

642
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:38,430
"While you churn buttermilk
and grind wheat.."

643
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:46,146
"..keep smiling and hide
away your sorrows."

644
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,232
"While churning the buttermilk.."

645
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,035
"..do not cry profusely."

646
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,864
"If they ask why you cry..

647
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:04,080
..tell them there's something
in your eye."

648
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,834
"While you churn but I: ermilk.."

649
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,174
"The time passes by quickly.."

650
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,967
Aunt Joshi, what goodies
have you brought today?

651
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,261
I have brought Puran poli (Sweet
stuffed flat bread).

652
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,473
-So we are going to eat
Puran Poli today?

653
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,811
"Remember you are fated to suffer
for four days a month."

654
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:30,277
"While you churn but I: ermilk.."

655
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,984
"Give us the strength
of the butter."

656
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,651
"Let all your happiness show.."

657
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,118
"Hide away your sorrows."

658
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,628
"While you churn but I: ermilk.."

659
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,257
"..purify the house.."

660
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:59,674
"Brighten the lives of others
with your motherly love."

661
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:06,972
Priest, have some betel nut.

662
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,269
The boat should have
arrived by now.

663
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,149
Ha ri! -Yes.

664
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,523
Are you sure you gave him the
right date in the letter?

665
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,692
Would I make such a mistake?

666
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,315
Then why isn't he here?
-He'll come soon.

667
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,067
Here's Jaanu.

668
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,490
Aunt, see this smarty has come.

669
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,157
- Jaanu, where's Mahadev?
- He's here. But he's unwell.

670
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,666
Travelling is tiring.

671
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,919
Mahadev! What happened?

672
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,002
Mahadev, what's wrong?

673
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,176
I'm not feeling well. -Dear God!

674
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,045
You have temperature.

675
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,180
Careful.

676
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,684
Hari, he has fever.

677
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,264
Mahadev, what happened?

678
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,263
You're burning.

679
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,681
Sit down.

680
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,599
Sit down. -Oh, God!

681
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,187
Shall we postpone the ceremony,
priest?

682
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:56,738
Till he feels better.

683
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,319
We can. There is no problem.

684
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,816
We'll find another date.

685
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,151
No need.

686
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,820
How will you perform the
ceremony in this state?

687
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,871
When is the next auspicious day?
-In a month.

688
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,210
No, brother.

689
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,746
I will do the ceremony.

690
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,205
Absolutely not. -Hari!

691
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,756
It's only fever.

692
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,459
He'll be fine.

693
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,211
Nothing will happen.
He will sit for the veneration.

694
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,174
Okay.

695
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,200
Wake him up.

696
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:47,948
Sanskrit Chants.

697
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,673
Repeat after me.

698
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,110
He's nodded off

699
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,282
Brother-in-law..
-Yes. -Brother-in-law!

700
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,220
Come near me.

701
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,327
What's wrong?
What's wrong with you?

702
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,794
Listen! Listen!

703
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,759
Get up! Talk to me.

704
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,011
What's wrong?

705
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,398
Docto r! Doctor!

706
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,439
What is it, Jaanu? What brings
you here so late at night?

707
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,778
Brother Mahadev is very ill.

708
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,988
He has a high fever,
come with me immediately.

709
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,384
Let me take that.

710
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,648
The condition is serious.
-What do you mean?

711
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,274
His fever is increasing.
My medicines aren't working.

712
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,445
He might not have seen
a doctor soon.

713
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:10,825
What can we do now?

714
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:16,406
Let's wait till morning.
The rest is in God's hands.

715
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,720
I've worshipped You selflessly
till date.

716
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:32,881
Never asked for anything.

717
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,467
But today I am asking You.

718
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,096
If anyone must die in this
house then let it be me.

719
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,391
I have lived my life.

720
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,270
But Mahadev has just
started his life.

721
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,022
Make him well again.

722
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,863
I will pray to You
till he recovers.

723
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,504
Mahadev, how could you leave us?

724
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,173
Why did you leave us and go?

725
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,531
Come! (calling crows to eat)

726
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,695
Come! (calling crows to eat)

727
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,497
Come! (calling crows to eat)

728
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,500
Come! (calling crows to eat)

729
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,546
Come! (calling crows to eat)

730
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,179
Ha ridada..

731
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,550
It's been a long time that
here is no sign of a crow.

732
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,927
Guruji,
only you can suggest a solution.

733
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:05,724
I see no other way.
Let us make a crow out of straw.

734
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:07,525
It is not the custom.

735
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,528
It is written in the
Holy Scriptures.

736
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:13,398
No.

737
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:18,112
How much longer must we wait?
People are waiting.

738
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,745
Wait..

739
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:35,590
Mahadev!

740
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:18,756
I had lost all hope
of sighting a crow.

741
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,718
I was thinking how would I pacify
Hari in agreeing to making a..

742
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:26,562
.. crow out of straw to complete
the rituqal if Hari would not adhere..

743
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,606
..and at that moment the
crow swooped down.

744
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:32,606
A glimmer of light in dark times.

745
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,614
Haridada whispered something
to Mahadev.. -What?

746
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,695
..and a miracle unfolded
before our eyes and..

747
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,655
..we saw crows swooping
down on the 'Pind'.

748
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:43,246
What did he whisper?
-Only Hari knows that.

749
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,077
_.or else Mahadev's soul.

750
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,958
Follow me.

751
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,458
Sit here.

752
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,089
I'll be right back.

753
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,799
Ta ra!

754
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,635
Ta ra!

755
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,213
Ta ra!

756
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,509
How much longer will you cry?

757
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,266
Your eyes are swollen.

758
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,397
Go, call Uma.

759
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,016
I asked Shantu to come here.

760
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,276
Today is the tenth day.

761
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,441
We must shave her head.

762
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:21,777
God's ways are beyond us.

763
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:26,573
The house resounded with
joy not long ago.

764
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,334
Festoon and bananas were
hanging on the door.

765
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:35,708
And today..sorrow has cast
a shadow on us now.

766
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,423
Aunt Namu.
-Come, dear child. Come.

767
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,713
Shantu is here. Come.

768
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:46,764
No, aunt.
I don't want my head shaved, aunt.

769
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:51,355
These are not our decisions.
This is fated for you. -No. No!

770
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,316
No! -Sit. Don't cry.

771
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,731
Sister-in-law, tell her to stop.

772
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:56,773
I don't want to shave my head.

773
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,440
-We are not your enemies. -Sit
down. -Do you think it makes us happy? -No!

774
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,323
What are you waiting for? Start!

775
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:05,703
What's going on?

776
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,537
I am asking you what's going on?

777
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,710
Don't you know what's going on?

778
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,788
Must we explain?

779
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,967
I understand this.
But who gave you permission?

780
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,799
Who gave you permission?

781
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:25,882
Get up!

782
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,767
Get up.

783
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:30,728
Hari!

784
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:34,732
Go inside.

785
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,734
Go inside the house.
Nothing will happen to you

786
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,442
Don't be afraid at all.

787
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,707
Shantu, don't you understand me?
Get up!

788
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:52,708
Take this! -Hari!

789
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,172
What are you looking at?

790
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,090
I've just performed brother's
last rites.

791
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,337
Bring me water to bathe.

792
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:15,773
What can I say? My God!

793
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,184
Oh, my God!

794
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,908
Priest, will you speak?

795
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,784
What can I say?
I have been silenced.

796
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,954
He dared to throw Shantu out.

797
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,795
He was only doing his duty.

798
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,674
This has gone too far.
Does this suit him?

799
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,426
Outrageous!

800
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,798
I said nothing when
he said he would..

801
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,262
..offer a clay buffalo
to the Goddess.

802
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,057
A curse will fall on us if we
don't follow our religion.

803
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,637
His actions will get us
all in trouble one day.

804
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,891
Priest, say something.

805
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,484
You stopped me from
doing anything.

806
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:04,189
Priest, do as you please.

807
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,595
No, no, no!

808
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:13,401
Uma! -Let me go!

809
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,028
No! No! -Uma, what happened?
What happened?

810
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,948
What's wrong?

811
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,372
Save me. Save me.

812
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,842
Help me. -Help her up -Why are you
doing this?... Please help me.

813
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,586
Uma, get up. -Get up.

814
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,590
Uma! -Save me, please.

815
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,136
Save me.

816
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:39,931
Please save me.

817
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,138
Please save me.

818
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:43,939
Calm down.

819
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,769
No one can harm you
as long as I live.

820
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:53,945
Don't be afraid.

821
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:55,826
Go to sleep now.

822
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,955
Stay with her till
she falls asleep.

823
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:04,285
Come.

824
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:06,837
Sleep now.

825
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,013
2 kilos yellow lentils..

826
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:24,434
A bottle of coconut oil.
2 kilos of sugar.

827
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,064
And some jaggery.

828
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,561
Here's the money.

829
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,312
Hello, Haridada.

830
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,114
Narharpanth?

831
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,067
You here?

832
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,994
Is everything all right? -Yes..

833
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:41,739
Yes.

834
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:43,824
Sit down.

835
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,502
Hello. -The list..

836
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,052
Tell me.

837
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,715
I didn't get a chance to talk
to you at the funeral.

838
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,766
So I came here today.

839
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,145
What was so awkward to say?

840
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,024
Now what should we do?

841
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:11,769
About what are you talking?

842
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:14,776
I want to take Durga home.

843
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,734
How is that possible?

844
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,738
Oncethe showers that have
fallen on the earth..

845
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,040
..does it ever return
to the clouds?

846
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:28,703
That's not it.

847
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,673
But the way things are happening..

848
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,458
..that's why this question
was raised.

849
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,088
It's destiny.

850
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,881
What's the point in
taking her home?

851
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,849
Nowadays there are instituitions.

852
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,849
We will see about her
further education.

853
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,063
How will that help her?

854
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,349
She'll learn to stand
on her own feet.

855
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,770
That means she will earn a living?

856
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,107
She lacks nothing here.

857
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,078
And..

858
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,080
..she is not any refugee.

859
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,033
She has what is rightfully hers.

860
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,790
Then let her spend some time
with her mother at least.

861
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,840
Her mother is in a state of shock.

862
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,343
Ask her mother to come
here and meet her.

863
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,254
How can you say that?

864
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:25,676
I understand you don't want
to send her home forever.

865
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,096
But you're going too far.

866
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:33,476
Fine.

867
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,151
Let Uma decide whether
she wants to..

868
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,520
..go to her maternal house or not.

869
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,363
Her decision is final.

870
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,083
Please talk to him.

871
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,592
Don't forget that you arranged
this marriage.

872
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,254
I don't need to talk.

873
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,011
Hari gave you his word that what..

874
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,224
..Uma says will be the final word.

875
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:13,228
Hari never goes back on his word.

876
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,658
Durga!

877
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:30,536
Talk to me.

878
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,375
Father, I'm not coming.

879
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:36,422
If you're being forced
to say this..

880
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,505
No, father.

881
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,172
No one is forcing me
to do anything.

882
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:45,093
Your mother is worried about you.

883
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,683
I miss her a lot as well, father.

884
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,934
But the day I got married
didn't you say..

885
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,523
..my husband's family
becomes my family?

886
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,820
If I leave them and
accompany you..

887
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,904
..is that not against your
teaching, father?

888
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,451
What you're thinking..

889
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,076
..I have no idea.

890
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,171
Take care of yourself.

891
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,618
If you're not going to get angry
I want to ask something.

892
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,247
Why didn't I let Uma go home?

893
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,253
Is that your question?

894
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:05,135
I could guess from yours and
Balwant's expression.

895
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,923
Do you disapprove?

896
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:12,719
No. But why be so obstinate?

897
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,266
Her father wanted
to take her home.

898
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,390
It would free us from the burden.

899
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,399
Burden? What burden?

900
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,857
We promised to take care of her.

901
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,236
How can we turn away from
our responsibility?

902
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,707
Is this responsibility so easy?

903
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,286
She is only 14 -15 years old.

904
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,751
Her life is ahead of her.

905
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,750
We'll have to take care
of so many things.

906
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,422
What are you scared of?

907
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,682
Nothing.

908
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:12,279
"How beautiful is the
sacred Basil plant."

909
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:20,370
"How beautiful is the
sacred Basil plant."

910
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:29,967
"Lord Krishna came on foot
for her Swayamvar."

911
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:37,846
"Lord Krishna came on foot.
He came walking."

912
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:47,230
"Lord Krishna plays
under your shadow."

913
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:56,998
"Krishna plays..Krishna plays.."

914
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:05,373
"How beautiful is the
sacred Basil plant."

915
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:12,680
"How beautiful is the
sacred Basil plant."

916
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,232
What do you want to tell me,
aunty? Tell me.

917
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,446
You didn't listen to
me the other day.

918
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,623
You threw Shantu out.

919
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,918
How will you face
this problem now?

920
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,755
Speak plainly. Face what?

921
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:52,337
All the Brahmins are threatening
to spurn our family.

922
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,757
The scoundrel priest
is instigating them.

923
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,593
They cannot harm me in any way.

924
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:01,933
Don't misunderstand me.

925
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,691
Tradition demands that Uma's
head should be shaved.

926
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:08,685
Tell me.

927
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,190
What tradition, aunt?

928
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:11,984
We're doing everything
according to tradition.

929
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,241
I mean according to family custom.

930
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,782
Aunt,
as you are an elderly person..

931
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,405
..of this family I respect you.

932
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,416
But if someone wishes to
tell me what to do..

933
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,453
..I cannot respect them.

934
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,589
If the Brahmins really
decide to spurn us..

935
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,751
..then no Brahmin priest will
perform our family rituals.

936
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,461
What will you do then?

937
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:38,215
If that time comes I'll
learn them myself.

938
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:42,227
The Gods will not accept even
water that Uma touches.

939
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,894
They will have to accept it.

940
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:54,193
Have we not quietly accepted
god's decision?

941
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:59,532
Till date nothing fell short
in His veneration.

942
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,202
Never missing a day of fasting.

943
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,243
Performing every ritual.
No one went against th customs.

944
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:08,829
In spite of that..

945
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:13,175
..our parents were taken from us
when Mahadev was an infant.

946
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:16,924
I never complained.

947
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,890
Before he could start a new life..

948
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,511
..so cruelly was he taken away.

949
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,387
He was taken away, right?

950
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:31,147
Yet I blamed my fate.

951
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:42,496
Now henceforth He better accept
anything that Uma offers Him.

952
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,163
One more thing I would like
to tell you, aunt.

953
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:51,334
I will not tolerate
anyone in this..

954
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,124
..house discussing this again.

955
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,635
'Organisation to help women find
the right path.' 'Bombay.'

956
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:49,513
Come in.

957
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,109
Please come.

958
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:08,865
Sit down.

959
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:14,371
Yes, tell me.

960
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:15,588
My name is Manda Desai.

961
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,583
I need help.

962
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,506
Have you no one?

963
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:23,638
Not exactly.

964
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:25,674
You see..

965
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:28,181
..my husband died two years ago.

966
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:32,351
I hope to remarry.

967
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,313
But I will have to leave
my in-laws' home.

968
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:40,697
And I can't return to my parents.
They aren't well off.

969
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:43,817
I want to work but..

970
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,657
But won't find work in
Mumbai immediately.

971
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,032
What can we do for you?

972
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:55,003
Give me a little money
till I find work.

973
01:08:55,882 --> 01:09:01,673
I'm sorry. But this organization
only guides helpless women.

974
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,087
We don't give money.

975
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:07,682
In fact we have no money.

976
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,680
I came here with much hope.

977
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:12,392
Many told me that you
go to Haridada..

978
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,888
..and he would surely help you.

979
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:17,650
I'm not Haridada.

980
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,228
I'm Balwant.

981
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:21,608
So?

982
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,079
Hello. -Hello.

983
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:30,697
I heard what you were saying.

984
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,458
Balwant is right.

985
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,506
We have no money.

986
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,383
Very well.

987
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:45,721
You came to Mumbai to find
work that means..

988
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,177
..you are not from here.

989
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:52,390
My husband is from Akola.
I was born in Konkan.

990
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,846
Torgao is my village.

991
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,693
What?
-My grandfather was priest there.

992
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,123
Sit down. Sit.

993
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,164
I'll be right back.

994
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:23,674
Listen.

995
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,284
Shall I serve dinner?

996
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,404
No, wait.

997
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:03,752
What is it? Where's the priest?

998
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:07,468
What happened?

999
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,012
The scoundrel priest has..

1000
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,716
_.told everyone in the
neighbouring villages..

1001
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,139
..that the Brahmins have
spurned our house.

1002
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:19,105
I have searched in all the
neighboring villages.

1003
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,851
No priest is willing to perform
Shankarshan's thread ceremony.

1004
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,197
The priests would go
to this length..

1005
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,738
..I never realized that.

1006
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,779
Sister-in-law, can you come in?

1007
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,412
What is it?

1008
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,169
Sister-in-law,
this is all my fault.

1009
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,882
We would not be in trouble
if we would..

1010
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,880
..have followed the tradition.

1011
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:57,470
Tell him I'll do what is
expected of a widow.

1012
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,564
I'll perform all the rituals
as per the tradition.

1013
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,689
I have no use of my hair now.

1014
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,692
For whom shall I adorn them?

1015
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:12,784
Tell her..

1016
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:16,155
..not to waste time thinking
of useless things.

1017
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,789
I am still alive to take the
decisions of this house.

1018
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:26,916
I'll handle what befalls
this house.

1019
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,833
Balwant, what took you so long?
And what are you wearing?

1020
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:03,664
The British are looking for me.

1021
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,290
What now?

1022
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,881
Never mind. Why did you call me?

1023
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,292
I have a very important task.

1024
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,755
But it should be done discreetly.

1025
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,430
Don't worry about that.

1026
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,928
You once told me that your
freedom fighters staying..

1027
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:24,351
.. underground can deliver
information far and wide. -Yes.

1028
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,019
I want to send an urgent
message quickly.

1029
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:33,690
I need the answer before the
Goddess's festival next month.

1030
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,405
Can your people do it?

1031
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:38,991
What is the message? -Come here.

1032
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:43,250
No priest will perform my son's
head shaving ceremony

1033
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,915
I want to let the villagers
know that..

1034
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:50,211
..I am willing to do what it
takes to earn their trust.

1035
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,256
Okay. You don't worry.

1036
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,762
My men will take care of it.

1037
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,128
Please come. Welcome.

1038
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:39,968
Where are you?

1039
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:44,977
No, child. Don't get up.

1040
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,518
You should never get up when
you are having food.

1041
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,767
Everyone is at the festival..

1042
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,731
..there's only both of us at home.

1043
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:57,945
We're fated to have just
one another from now.

1044
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,537
Being born a woman is a curse.

1045
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,498
Being a widow, even worse.

1046
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,543
We have to spend our lives
in a dark room.

1047
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:12,540
We should not attend festivals
or any auspicious occasions.

1048
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,003
We must eat simple food.

1049
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,678
No oil, no butter.

1050
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:21,639
Destroy our taste buds.

1051
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,092
But you are fine.

1052
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:28,104
Tara serves you what they eat.

1053
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:33,018
You're lucky to have landed
in Hari's house.

1054
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:37,026
That's why you enjoy
the best meals.

1055
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:38,903
Hair intact.

1056
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:41,192
Look at me.

1057
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,993
When I was widowed no one defied
tradition for my sake.

1058
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:51,749
I went to sleep with a full head
of hair and woke up bald.

1059
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:58,084
Before I knew the joys of married
life, I became a widow.

1060
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:05,057
Do you remember Mahadev's face?

1061
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,306
Do you remember his face?

1062
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:15,776
Shall I tell you one thing!

1063
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,068
A girl like you should
not look pretty.

1064
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,112
Men have dirty minds.

1065
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:24,702
Men by nature are..

1066
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:26,738
..jackals!

1067
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:32,870
Even married men desire
other women..

1068
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:38,128
All they want is to bed her.

1069
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,714
When they are satisfied..

1070
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:44,221
_.they ostracize her and
banish her from society.

1071
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:49,309
Are you saying that I am
unsafe in this house?

1072
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,768
Not at all, child.
My Hari isn't like that.

1073
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,357
But I can't speak for other men.

1074
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,190
Can misfortune be predicted?

1075
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:01,739
I had better go.

1076
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:06,410
Don't tell anyone I was
chewing tobacco.

1077
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:07,987
Allow me.

1078
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,199
Finish your lunch. I'm going.

1079
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:13,284
Oh, my god!

1080
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,146
Come inside. They're waiting.

1081
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,686
I'm coming.
You proceed, I will follow you.

1082
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:48,194
Come. Come.

1083
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:54,121
That man with 'Kambal' (Blanket).

1084
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:58,583
You mean to say, coat?
-No, the 'Kambal'.

1085
01:17:58,841 --> 01:17:59,831
A blanket? -Yes!

1086
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,130
Derick, you go from here.
Go fast. -Yes, sir.

1087
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:08,176
Brother, sister-in-law is calling
you. -Yes, let's go.

1088
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,179
Let's just move. Come. Come.

1089
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,010
Freeze! Freeze!

1090
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,519
Running away fast..
-Vande Mataram!

1091
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:19,150
I salute the Motherland!
-Keep quiet!

1092
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,147
Vande Mataram! -Come on.

1093
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,939
Vande Mataram!

1094
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,439
Balwant, what is this?

1095
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:27,108
How did this happen?

1096
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,195
Vande Mataram!

1097
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:33,995
Oh, no! -Vande Mataram!

1098
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,325
Go inside. Come on, let's go.

1099
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:37,168
Vande Mataram!

1100
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,629
Vande Mataram!

1101
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,082
Vande Mataram!

1102
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,801
Did you see! The police have
arrested your friend.

1103
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:47,595
That's good.

1104
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:49,680
There will be peace in the
village for sometime now.

1105
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:51,887
It's festival time..

1106
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,474
..so I won't argue with you.

1107
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:56,763
Arguement?

1108
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,015
Who'd want to argue
with you anyway?

1109
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:03,319
The Brahmins have spurned your
family due to your behavior.

1110
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,231
You thought you'd perfrom the
thread ceremony of your son..

1111
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,199
_.by calling a priest from
the neighbouring village.

1112
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:10,488
What happened? Did you perform
the thread ceremony?

1113
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,947
This decision was taken without
letting me put up my side.

1114
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,706
So you want your say?

1115
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,125
Okay. Then come to the meeting
tomorrow evening.

1116
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:36,427
Speak now!

1117
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:40,014
Why so silent now?

1118
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,234
You wanted to talk. Go on.

1119
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:48,360
You offered a clay buffalo
to the Goddess.

1120
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:49,698
You insulted Her.

1121
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,782
But She took Her sacrifice.

1122
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,746
Your poor brother paid
for your sins.

1123
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,878
But you still haven't
mended your ways.

1124
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:07,792
Is there a house in this village
that hasn't seen death?

1125
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:09,510
Answer me.

1126
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:10,886
Is there such a house?

1127
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,932
Priest,
does that mean we are all sinners?

1128
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,389
Don't be so righteous.

1129
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,814
You have a widowed daughter-in-law
in your house..

1130
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:24,646
..who ignores all rituals.
What about that?

1131
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,106
Read this. -What's this?

1132
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:32,275
This is a letter of forgiveness
from the..

1133
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:33,868
"esteemed Mahadev Shastri
from Kashi.

1134
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,323
A month back I sent them a
message and told them..

1135
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:42,038
..I am ready to repent for
my sins which were..

1136
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,499
..committed intentionally
or unintentionally.

1137
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:47,832
He asked me to pay a
three-rupee fine.

1138
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,585
I have done so.
The receipt of which..

1139
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,424
_.is attached with the letter.

1140
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,384
So what I wish to state is..

1141
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:58,969
..I've been forgiven for
all my sins till date.

1142
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,138
So for the same sins..

1143
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,648
This will not do.

1144
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,652
But this is written in
the Holy Scriptures.

1145
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:13,566
I don't agree at all.

1146
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:16,118
Why not?

1147
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,783
What do you think of yourself?

1148
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,118
Do you think you're above Mahadev
Shastri from Kashi?

1149
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,374
Hari, don't worry.

1150
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:31,047
Shankarshan's thread ceremony
will be solemnized.

1151
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:37,344
I welcome you to our home,
to bless my son.

1152
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:39,554
You too..

1153
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,899
My brother's son is
getting married.

1154
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,978
I will have to go to Ratnagiri
next month.

1155
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,354
-Whose luggage is that, Jaanu?

1156
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:34,488
Mine, brother.

1157
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:38,363
Must you leave? Stay longer.

1158
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:42,621
Janki and Charu are alone at home.

1159
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,875
My husband cannot manage
children at all.

1160
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:49,162
What will son-in-law do
with all his money?

1161
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,548
He didn't come for
my son's ceremony.

1162
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,134
He was very busy this time.

1163
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,761
But brother,
the ceremony went well.

1164
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,181
Let me pay my respects.
-Never mind.

1165
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,763
Don't bend now and don't
work too hard.

1166
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:05,886
You're in your seventh month,
isn't it?

1167
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,189
No escaping housework.

1168
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:14,278
My little ones never let me rest.
They always need something

1169
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:17,152
Why not hire someone to help?

1170
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:22,946
Brother,
can I take Uma home with me?

1171
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:31,371
How did that absurd thought
cross your mind?

1172
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:35,925
Absurd? I have taken sister-in-law
Tara's permission.

1173
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,593
I make the decisions
in this house.

1174
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,551
Not the women.

1175
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:47,474
Atleast hear me out.

1176
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:52,442
If we don't help our own family,
then who will help?

1177
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,603
I don't need to solve the
problems of the world.

1178
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,901
Everyone faces such problems
sometime or the other.

1179
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,816
What great problem does she have?

1180
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:05,447
God also gives 9 months to prepare
for a child's birth.

1181
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,531
You should've arranged something.

1182
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,584
There's no one to accompany
me so I asked.

1183
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,668
To cook two meals for
so many people..

1184
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,507
Ask your husband to help you.

1185
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:19,840
He loves children, isn't it?

1186
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:21,962
Tell him to feed them.

1187
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:35,777
What did I say to offend
him so much?

1188
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:41,532
When it comes to Uma no one
can reason with him.

1189
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:44,493
We cannot say a word.

1190
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:13,556
Here..

1191
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,313
Mangalsutral
(Sacred wedding necklace).

1192
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:24,366
Sell it.
You'll get the money you need.

1193
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,537
Sorry, how can I take it?

1194
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,540
Who does it belong to?

1195
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:33,871
My wife.

1196
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,204
Tara.

1197
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:44,591
Aunt Namu,
Joshi said you called the doctor?

1198
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,841
Tara has a stomach ache again.

1199
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:53,096
So Haridada will soon announce
some good news.

1200
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:08,577
What is it?

1201
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:12,868
Let's go out.

1202
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:31,096
She has a large lump
in her stomach.

1203
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:35,476
A three-month foetus cannot
be that large.

1204
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:38,106
It should be like a small pumpkin.

1205
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:40,609
What do you mean?

1206
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:44,196
She is not pregnant.
I think it's a tumour.

1207
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,667
You must be careful.

1208
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:01,251
She must not move. If the tumour
bursts, it could kill her.

1209
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,676
She needs complete bed rest.

1210
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:10,260
Let her room be as
quiet as possible.

1211
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,384
And if possible even
during the day.

1212
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:15,765
Don't let anyone go into her room.

1213
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:19,018
She has become very weak.

1214
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:22,769
No more physical work for her.

1215
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:26,614
She should stop filling water
and washing clothes.

1216
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:28,573
She may be obstinate.

1217
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,025
But stop her from doing all this.

1218
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:33,529
She mustn't step into
the kitchen either.

1219
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,032
Be strict about meals.

1220
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:41,625
Her food must have
no oil or spice.

1221
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,372
It'll trouble her.

1222
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:45,758
Make sure that she is..

1223
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,718
..given the right dose of medicine
at the right time.

1224
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:50,220
Once in the morning
and once at night.

1225
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,257
We should do utmost what we can.

1226
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,427
Leave the rest to God.

1227
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,694
Jaanu, are my clothes ready?

1228
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:10,824
Brother, I'll keep it.

1229
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:17,660
Uma! Uma!

1230
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:20,454
Coming, sister-in-law.

1231
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,712
Haridada is bathing.
I'll keep his clothes ready.

1232
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:25,797
He needs everything on time.

1233
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,433
Sister-in-law, I was on my way.

1234
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,149
Do you need anything?

1235
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:52,358
Some water?

1236
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,390
Sit here.

1237
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,946
But Haridada may need..
-Wait here.

1238
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,490
He'll manage.

1239
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:36,785
You have the time
to help everyone.

1240
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,241
But no time to sit with me.

1241
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:41,790
Don't say that.

1242
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:44,034
It's her hard work
running the house.

1243
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:47,125
Didn't I do it when I was well?

1244
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:48,793
I wasn't appreciated then.

1245
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,960
I never asked for this illness.

1246
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:03,349
What is it?

1247
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,561
What's bothering you?

1248
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:08,813
I'm worried about the family.

1249
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,271
I'm bedridden like this.

1250
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:16,317
Wonder how will this house run?

1251
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,243
Everything is going on smoothly.

1252
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,911
Are the children neglected?
Or they are not studying?

1253
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:28,371
The house is clean,
the kitchen is well stocked.

1254
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,837
Everything is running smooth.

1255
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:35,001
So why worry?

1256
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,300
Uma..

1257
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:40,557
Everything will be fine.
She'll be also fine.

1258
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:43,177
Lie down now.

1259
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:45,224
Alright.

1260
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:47,890
Oh, my god!

1261
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,870
Open the door quickly. Uma!

1262
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,417
You're here?

1263
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:13,878
Were you sleeping? Why did you
take so long to open the door?

1264
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:17,170
No. I was waiting for you.

1265
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:19,888
Sister-in-law..

1266
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:21,260
She's sleeping.

1267
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:24,806
Are you sure? -Yes.

1268
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,682
What if she wakes up?
-She won't wake up.

1269
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:34,816
I gave her an extra
dose of medicine.

1270
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:45,617
I can hear someone coming.

1271
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:47,870
Nobody's there.

1272
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:49,918
You're imagining things.

1273
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:52,125
I'm scared.

1274
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,673
Scared? I'm right here.

1275
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:00,970
What if someone finds out?

1276
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,090
What if someone sees us?

1277
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:07,014
No one will. I will protect you.

1278
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:09,972
Come.

1279
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:19,280
I knew someone would find out.

1280
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,321
Someone would catch us.
-Keep quiet.

1281
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:23,910
Be quiet or I'll kill you.
Be quiet.

1282
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:42,382
Why are you here?

1283
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,552
You were told to stay in bed,
isn't it?

1284
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:48,559
Didn't the doctor tell you?

1285
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:51,726
Get out of here I say!

1286
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:03,609
Oh, my!

1287
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:35,019
Tara! Tara, what's wrong?

1288
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:37,313
Sankarshan!
Sankarshan, come quickly.

1289
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,731
Your mother has fallen down.

1290
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:40,938
What? -Tara! Tara!

1291
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:43,190
Mother! -Tara! -Sister-in-law!

1292
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:44,649
Mother! -Tara! -Sister-in-law!

1293
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:47,615
What's happened? -I don't know.
I was asleep here..

1294
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,454
I heard a noise.
I found her on the floor.

1295
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,956
How did she get here?
-How would I know?

1296
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:54,750
Is she hurt? -Am I a doctor?

1297
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:56,040
Then call him!

1298
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:09,675
She has injured her neck and back.

1299
01:34:10,937 --> 01:34:14,646
I told you she must have
complete bed rest.

1300
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:16,932
We never let her get up.

1301
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,068
I don't know why she
got up and went in.

1302
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:24,064
Make a paste of this herb
and give her immediately.

1303
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:27,154
Okay, I'm going.

1304
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:29,027
Give it to me. -Yes.

1305
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:31,363
Take care.

1306
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,878
Call me, if her condition worsens.

1307
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:40,714
Sure. -Goodbye.

1308
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:51,221
Listen! Listen!

1309
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:54,181
Listen to me.

1310
01:34:58,484 --> 01:34:59,519
What do you want?

1311
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,564
Uma!

1312
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:09,075
You like Uma, don't you?

1313
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,203
You like Uma, isn't it?

1314
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:15,285
I know you do.

1315
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:20,788
I know she likes you too.

1316
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,378
What are you blabbering?

1317
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:29,012
I was scared something..

1318
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,131
..would happen between you two..

1319
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:33,884
..that fear..

1320
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:37,095
..has disturbed me a lot.

1321
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:42,184
But now I think if
something like..

1322
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:44,232
..that happens it will be better.

1323
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:46,521
Really.

1324
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:48,614
When I die you must marry her.

1325
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:50,533
After I'm gone.

1326
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,408
The thought of marrying Uma
can never come to my mind.

1327
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,998
Why are you thinking
of such things?

1328
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:00,414
After my death if you bring..

1329
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:02,253
_.another woman into this house..

1330
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:05,465
..then she..

1331
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,460
..she wouldn't..

1332
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:10,921
..love my children.

1333
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:17,261
You've done so much for Uma,

1334
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,396
You defied tradition for her sake.

1335
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,316
Do this too.

1336
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:24,771
Do one more thing.

1337
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,066
Your mind is playing
tricks on you.

1338
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:30,528
Nothing such will ever hapen.
You'll be fine soon.

1339
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,658
No, I won't recover.

1340
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:34,406
When I close my eyes..

1341
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:37,990
..I see God's abode.

1342
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,456
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law, what is it?

1343
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:48,215
What is it? -Uma! Uma!

1344
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:52,050
Uma, give me your word.
Promise me. Give me your word.

1345
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:55,219
Promise me that you will
never leave this family.

1346
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:57,221
Sister-in-law, why will I do that?

1347
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:58,851
Swear on me..

1348
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:01,313
Okay, I.. -Promise me.

1349
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:04,524
You'll take care of my children.
-I promise you.

1350
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:07,690
Why are you saying these things?
Nothing will happen to you.

1351
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,195
Nothing will happen to you.

1352
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:14,568
Oh, Lord, You did not heed
me when Mahadev was ill.

1353
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:17,991
Heed me now.

1354
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,534
You know the troubles
we are facing.

1355
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,379
If anything happens to Tara..

1356
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,754
..a calamity will befall us.

1357
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:35,884
Help us.

1358
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:39,013
Save Tara.

1359
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:43,518
You must save her.

1360
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:15,883
Modern thinking is fine..

1361
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:18,757
..but not when it interferes
with tradition.

1362
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:22,765
Look at what's happened.

1363
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:24,683
What is the situation?

1364
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:28,399
Will you be quiet? -I will be.

1365
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:33,609
But his family has paid the
price for his deeds.

1366
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,286
Now that his wife is dead..

1367
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,244
..he is free to do as he pleases.

1368
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:47,168
Priest,
this isn't the time to say this.

1369
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:50,079
It's never the right time for you.

1370
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:54,209
Deny them their rights to perform
the Goddess's festival.

1371
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:57,678
And shave Uma's head.

1372
01:39:02,812 --> 01:39:06,225
I can't accept your wife's
wedding necklace.

1373
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:10,145
I have nothing else to offer.

1374
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:12,852
But why are you doing
so much for me?

1375
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:14,858
I..

1376
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:18,316
We're originally from the
same village, Torgaon.

1377
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:20,235
We knew..

1378
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:22,077
..your grandfather well.

1379
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,576
Really? -Yes.

1380
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:28,118
We knew the priest very well.

1381
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:30,537
Slowly!

1382
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:34,340
This is that house.

1383
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:38,511
First drag Uma out of the
house and shave her head.

1384
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:41,385
Then cover her face with cow dung.

1385
01:39:42,477 --> 01:39:45,094
If Hari tries to stop you,
break his bones.

1386
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,895
Understood? Have you understood?

1387
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:49,522
The money first.

1388
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:52,017
The money won't vanish.
-How do we know?

1389
01:39:58,075 --> 01:39:59,031
Ha ri, hello.

1390
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:04,784
Why are you here at this hour?

1391
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:07,828
I had to come. -Why?

1392
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:11,165
We can no longer tolerate
your indecent..

1393
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:12,454
..behaviour in this village.

1394
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:14,255
Meaning?

1395
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:17,383
Bring that prostitute out..

1396
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:21,004
..or leave this village at once.

1397
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:24,675
Priest, mind your tongue.
Or else I'll slash it.

1398
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:26,137
Okay.

1399
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:29,307
Fl

1400
01:40:32,902 --> 01:40:33,937
Go.

1401
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,019
Drag that prostitute out..

1402
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:38,192
..and burn this brothel down.

1403
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:39,568
Don't you dare!

1404
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:43,944
One more step and I'll kill you.

1405
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:47,492
Let me go. Let me go.

1406
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:50,575
Don't you dare step in.
-What's going on here?

1407
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:52,335
There she is!
There she is! -You go inside.

1408
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,497
What's going on?
-I told you to go inside.

1409
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:58,215
Hit him. Break his bones.

1410
01:40:58,469 --> 01:40:59,425
Get back inside!

1411
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:02,887
You coward..

1412
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,465
What are you doing?

1413
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:06,511
He has no shame.

1414
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:09,432
Beat him. -Don't let him hit you.

1415
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:12,430
What are you looking at? Get her.
There she is.

1416
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:15,016
Move back. -Go. Catch her!

1417
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:17,311
I'll have to do something myself.

1418
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:18,728
Leave him. -Move!

1419
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:21,280
You scoundrelsl -Priest!

1420
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:22,774
Hari! -Let me go!

1421
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:24,989
Hari! -Priest! -Hari, leave me.

1422
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:26,403
Priest, turn back.

1423
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:28,329
I tell you come back.

1424
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:30,740
Priest! -You have killed your
sister-in-law and..

1425
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:32,662
..now you wish to be the
mistress of this house?

1426
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:34,578
Priest, don't lock horns with me.

1427
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:37,456
I will shave off your head.
-Priest!

1428
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:43,503
Get them!

1429
01:41:47,393 --> 01:41:48,804
Get lost from here!

1430
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,766
Hari, look here, I didn't
lay a finger on her.

1431
01:41:56,444 --> 01:42:00,028
I mean..please forgive me.
I have realized my mistake.

1432
01:42:07,997 --> 01:42:08,987
Oh, no!

1433
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:17,086
Thank you.

1434
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:20,881
You appeared like a God and
saved us. Who are you?

1435
01:42:23,012 --> 01:42:25,629
Hello. My name is Balwant Phadke.

1436
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,524
Aunt Namu..

1437
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:42,487
Let's go inside.
It's getting cold.

1438
01:42:43,074 --> 01:42:45,657
Sit for a while. Have betel nut.

1439
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:53,073
Did you finish the chores? -Yes.

1440
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,533
What about your husband?
-He is sleeping.

1441
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,580
Brother,
what do you plan to do now?

1442
01:43:00,758 --> 01:43:01,714
About what?

1443
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:03,545
About Uma?

1444
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:06,586
What should I do?

1445
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,838
Send her back to her parents.

1446
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,511
I won't do any such thing.

1447
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,809
Hari, don't be stubborn.

1448
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:16,638
Yesterday if Balwant wouldn't
have come..

1449
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:18,265
..who knows what would've
happened.

1450
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:22,022
Then you at least think
of remarriage.

1451
01:43:23,572 --> 01:43:25,028
It'll be three years
this year since..

1452
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:26,318
..sister-in-law Tara passed away.

1453
01:43:26,992 --> 01:43:28,528
How long will you live
alone like this?

1454
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:30,239
My married life is over.

1455
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:33,529
I won't remarry.

1456
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,575
Hari, you like Uma..

1457
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:37,666
..I know that.

1458
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:41,079
She too cares about you a lot.

1459
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:43,085
What nonsense, aunt!

1460
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:47,423
Marry her and put an
end to the gossip.

1461
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:48,628
I'll put an end to it.

1462
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:51,551
I've sent a letter to my son,
Shankarshan.

1463
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,350
Enough of his practice is Mumbai.

1464
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,557
He can practice law here
and get married.

1465
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:08,606
Pay your respects. Come.

1466
01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:11,864
It's okay.

1467
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:13,702
What have you named her?

1468
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:16,330
I stuck to the name her
parents have given her.

1469
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:19,575
Like father, like son.

1470
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:22,328
Seek her blessings. -Here.

1471
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:26,962
Aunt, we seek your blessings.

1472
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:36,471
Bless them or else they can't go.

1473
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:43,850
May you have a long life!

1474
01:44:45,488 --> 01:44:46,728
Aunt Uma is like my mother.

1475
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:50,690
When mother died she
looked after us.

1476
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:54,614
She was a great support
during my sister's..

1477
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:55,612
..Shanti and Khushi's wedding.

1478
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:59,578
Pay your respects to God.

1479
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,075
Come on, let's go.

1480
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,752
Priest, everything went smoothly.

1481
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,121
Panth is leaving.

1482
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,669
-Aren't you staying? -If everything
is done I was thinking of leaving.

1483
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,835
Mother, today I realized..

1484
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:18,184
..when I got married why aunt Namu
took her time to bless me.

1485
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:24,641
Keep this Mangalsutra.
It may be of use to you.

1486
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:26,184
But.. -Keep it.

1487
01:45:48,259 --> 01:45:49,841
I don't understand you at times.

1488
01:45:53,472 --> 01:45:55,759
You helped the priest's
granddaughter in..

1489
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:57,757
..spite of the way he
behaved with us.

1490
01:46:02,731 --> 01:46:06,599
Sudha! Sudha! Where are you going?

1491
01:46:07,653 --> 01:46:09,314
To change my sari.

1492
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:11,149
Why there?

1493
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:13,067
Change right here.

1494
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:14,986
So I can watch.

1495
01:46:15,661 --> 01:46:18,699
Don't be cheeky. -Cheeky?

1496
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:20,621
I am your husband.

1497
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:23,908
I am shy.

1498
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:25,869
No need to be shy.

1499
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:28,913
Come closer.

1500
01:46:29,633 --> 01:46:30,623
Let me go.

1501
01:46:33,178 --> 01:46:34,509
Your skin is so smooth.

1502
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:36,595
What are you saying?

1503
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:38,680
Really. -The truth..

1504
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:41,391
Let me go. -Come closer.

1505
01:46:43,772 --> 01:46:45,012
Don't take off my sari.

1506
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:46,723
But it has to go.

1507
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:48,561
Give me a kiss.

1508
01:46:49,778 --> 01:46:50,734
Leave me.

1509
01:46:51,697 --> 01:46:52,687
What now?

1510
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:55,023
That tickles. -Let it be.

1511
01:46:55,701 --> 01:46:57,738
Wait a minute. -Absolutely not.

1512
01:46:58,329 --> 01:46:59,285
Come closer.

1513
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:02,743
Why are you looking
at me that way?

1514
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:08,748
I'm coming. -Wait. -Why?

1515
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:13,875
Put out the lamp -Leave it on.
I want to see.

1516
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:16,961
Why do you say that?
No, put it out.

1517
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:20,010
You are so stubborn.

1518
01:47:21,644 --> 01:47:22,634
Let it be.

1519
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:01,847
Is the you, aunt?

1520
01:48:29,712 --> 01:48:30,747
What is it?

1521
01:48:32,423 --> 01:48:33,788
The grocery list.

1522
01:48:35,634 --> 01:48:36,669
Keep it there.

1523
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:43,673
Yesterday..

1524
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:46,300
Last night..

1525
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:49,349
I made a terrible mistake.

1526
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:53,854
I don't know why I did it.

1527
01:48:55,863 --> 01:48:58,480
What is the fitting punishment
for my mistake?

1528
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,823
Jaanu! -Coming, sir.

1529
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:04,902
Tell her..

1530
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:06,449
..from now on if she
needs anything..

1531
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:10,870
..she must ask you or
daughter-in-law.

1532
01:49:13,922 --> 01:49:14,878
The list.

1533
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:47,369
All have gone to Ranade's house.

1534
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:50,030
For the Satyanarayan veneration.

1535
01:49:50,042 --> 01:49:51,498
But we were going to go together.

1536
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:53,117
I got delayed.

1537
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:55,919
I'll catch him up on the way.
I'm leaving.

1538
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:57,580
Uncle..

1539
01:49:57,966 --> 01:49:58,922
What is it, child?

1540
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,258
I want to talk to you.

1541
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:07,431
Hello, Dada!

1542
01:50:07,726 --> 01:50:10,138
All good Jaanu? -Yes.

1543
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:12,640
Tell me.

1544
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:19,143
Can you ask your friend
what's troubling him?

1545
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:21,904
What do you mean?

1546
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:26,534
Why does he treat me like this?

1547
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:29,119
What do you mean?

1548
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,788
He asked me not to talk
to him henceforth.

1549
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:39,338
Nor come before him.
That is what he told me.

1550
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:42,090
Why?

1551
01:50:42,094 --> 01:50:44,381
I want you to ask him that.

1552
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:47,755
Why is he behaving like this?

1553
01:50:49,017 --> 01:50:52,100
I have made some small
or big mistakes.

1554
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:55,558
But such a severe punishment
for that?

1555
01:50:58,610 --> 01:50:59,975
Remember when you
used to visit us?

1556
01:51:00,988 --> 01:51:03,446
Once father made me stand in the..

1557
01:51:03,615 --> 01:51:05,947
..sun for a small mistake I made.

1558
01:51:07,828 --> 01:51:09,489
You were furious with him.

1559
01:51:11,874 --> 01:51:13,410
That was different, my dear.

1560
01:51:14,626 --> 01:51:15,787
Even if Hari is my friend..

1561
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:18,043
..but he's stubborn.

1562
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,002
Once he makes his mind up..

1563
01:51:23,427 --> 01:51:27,011
..nothing can change it.

1564
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:31,591
He would not like you telling
me all this either.

1565
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:34,051
You know that, right?

1566
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:38,063
Hari!
-Yet you stand here and talk to..

1567
01:51:38,233 --> 01:51:40,975
..the daughter-in-law
of this house.

1568
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:42,226
Have you no shame?

1569
01:51:45,365 --> 01:51:46,855
Hari! Tell him..

1570
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:50,985
She's like my daughter.

1571
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:52,570
But she isn't!

1572
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:02,046
I will not mind if you
don't come here again.

1573
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:11,048
If we need to talk,
we'll talk elsewhere.

1574
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:13,094
No need for that.

1575
01:52:14,937 --> 01:52:18,055
I have nothing to say to
a man who doubts me.

1576
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,350
Neither here..

1577
01:52:23,362 --> 01:52:24,397
..nor anywhere else.

1578
01:52:45,133 --> 01:52:46,123
Jaanu..

1579
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,818
"The dark colored Lord Pandurang!"

1580
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,611
Oh, God!

1581
01:53:16,498 --> 01:53:20,036
"The dark colored Lord Pandurang!"

1582
01:53:20,043 --> 01:53:21,704
Oh, god!

1583
01:53:23,088 --> 01:53:29,084
"I sing alone my first song."

1584
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:31,085
Oh, God!

1585
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:37,468
"I can see Lord Brahma and
Vishu at my doorstep."

1586
01:53:40,605 --> 01:53:46,521
"The second song I
sing to myself."

1587
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:54,776
"Let me behold the dark
Lord Pandurang."

1588
01:53:58,165 --> 01:54:01,453
"The dark colored Lord Pandurang!"

1589
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:10,462
"My third song of the 28 years.."

1590
01:54:12,763 --> 01:54:13,798
Who is that?

1591
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:17,882
It's me.

1592
01:54:18,226 --> 01:54:19,341
Your name, child?

1593
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,555
Durga.

1594
01:54:22,397 --> 01:54:23,478
That means Parvati.

1595
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,186
My Mahadev's Parvati.

1596
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,145
Did you go to school?

1597
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:33,105
I've passed 4th grade.

1598
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:34,940
What else do you know?

1599
01:54:35,494 --> 01:54:39,453
"Oh, world, oh, married life.."

1600
01:54:40,207 --> 01:54:43,950
"..is like a pan on
a burning fire."

1601
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:48,204
"Only by singeing your fingers.."

1602
01:54:49,049 --> 01:54:53,213
"..can you bake bread."

1603
01:54:54,054 --> 01:54:58,218
"Oh, married life.."

1604
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:02,593
Beautiful!

1605
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:13,320
Where does he disappear?

1606
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:25,499
Jaanu, what are you doing?
-Sir, I remember.

1607
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:28,745
I'm drawing water from the well
for watering the new plants.

1608
01:55:29,131 --> 01:55:31,964
From tonight,
sleep inside the house.

1609
01:55:33,301 --> 01:55:35,383
It will take time for my wound
on the foot to heal.

1610
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:36,468
Sure. I will come.

1611
01:55:37,305 --> 01:55:39,421
I'm scared of sleeping alone.

1612
01:55:39,724 --> 01:55:40,714
What did you say?

1613
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:43,175
Nothing.

1614
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:48,435
Water the plants now.
The noon sun will scorch the soil.

1615
01:55:48,817 --> 01:55:49,852
Okay. I'm going.

1616
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:59,071
"Where do I seek shelter?"

1617
01:55:59,494 --> 01:56:05,240
"Where have those feelings gone?"

1618
01:56:05,834 --> 01:56:09,293
"How much longer must I wait.."

1619
01:56:09,296 --> 01:56:12,254
"..for darkness to speak?"

1620
01:56:12,549 --> 01:56:18,465
"How long before the
light shines on me?"

1621
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:25,302
"Where do I seek shelter?"

1622
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:31,520
"Where have those feelings gone?"

1623
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:40,733
Vande Mataram!
Hail the Motherland!

1624
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:42,826
Hail the Motherland!

1625
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:48,207
-"Can I bear to see my face
in the mirror now?"

1626
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:54,289
"Or seek the fragrance
of flowers?"

1627
01:56:55,008 --> 01:57:01,220
"How do I atone for a
moment's mistake?"

1628
01:57:01,556 --> 01:57:07,427
"And restore my shattered life."

1629
01:57:11,316 --> 01:57:17,312
"Where do I seek shelter?"

1630
01:57:18,156 --> 01:57:22,366
"Whare are lost the.."
-Shankarshan, your sister is here.

1631
01:57:22,369 --> 01:57:23,734
Has she come? -Yes.

1632
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,336
You're late.

1633
01:57:34,839 --> 01:57:36,079
The sea was so choppy..

1634
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:38,670
_.but in spite of that
the boat reached early.

1635
01:57:43,431 --> 01:57:44,387
You only see.

1636
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:46,386
What is aunt Uma doing here?

1637
01:57:47,018 --> 01:57:48,804
She sits near the well all day.

1638
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:51,390
Is that the sari I sent
her last month?

1639
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:53,555
That's all she does nowadays.

1640
01:57:54,985 --> 01:57:57,022
Makes quilts of her new saris.

1641
01:57:58,488 --> 01:58:03,949
She sews for others and gives
the money to the temple.

1642
01:58:07,247 --> 01:58:08,282
Let's go.

1643
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:11,490
Father decided not to talk to her.

1644
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:15,210
Since then,
she hasn't been herself.

1645
01:58:15,213 --> 01:58:16,544
It's been over a year now.

1646
01:58:17,799 --> 01:58:21,212
Nothing interests her.
She talks to no one.

1647
01:58:22,846 --> 01:58:24,382
I can't bear to see her
in this condition.

1648
01:58:25,307 --> 01:58:27,423
Sister,
that's why I called you here.

1649
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:30,384
I'll try talking to her.

1650
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:33,971
Try it. She's fond of you.

1651
01:58:34,691 --> 01:58:35,852
She may listen to you.

1652
01:58:49,914 --> 01:58:50,949
Aunt Uma?

1653
01:58:52,626 --> 01:58:53,661
Are you sleeping?

1654
01:58:55,462 --> 01:58:56,418
Aunt Uma?

1655
01:58:59,633 --> 01:59:01,089
I don't get sleep at all.

1656
01:59:03,261 --> 01:59:05,423
I'm lying down with my face
is covered, that's all.

1657
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:08,589
Do you remember..

1658
01:59:09,684 --> 01:59:12,642
..how you, Shanti and I used
to play near the well?

1659
01:59:18,109 --> 01:59:20,646
What's this? Your hair is so dry.

1660
01:59:21,863 --> 01:59:23,399
You should oil it.

1661
01:59:25,033 --> 01:59:26,398
I lead a worthless life.

1662
01:59:27,452 --> 01:59:29,693
Why bother about all these things?

1663
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:35,370
Forget about me.

1664
01:59:37,045 --> 01:59:39,457
Tell me about you. How are you?

1665
01:59:40,924 --> 01:59:41,914
Is all well?

1666
01:59:46,137 --> 01:59:48,469
If you can't sleep,
shall I read to you?

1667
01:59:53,895 --> 01:59:54,930
Do me a favour?

1668
01:59:56,356 --> 01:59:57,312
Of course.

1669
01:59:58,149 --> 01:59:59,105
Anything.

1670
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:04,319
There's a question that has
troubled me for years.

1671
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:11,444
What happens on the first night
you spend with your husband?

1672
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:15,572
Tell me. Kushi, tell me.

1673
02:00:15,834 --> 02:00:17,495
Tell me once.
Come closer and tell me.

1674
02:00:18,044 --> 02:00:19,034
Touch me and tell me.

1675
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:21,624
-What are you doing?
Let go! -Tell me once.

1676
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:23,497
Tell me. -Leave me!

1677
02:00:25,343 --> 02:00:27,209
My life has been so unfulfilled.

1678
02:00:29,889 --> 02:00:32,551
I know I've missed out
on something..

1679
02:00:32,559 --> 02:00:34,675
"important when my husband died.

1680
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:40,063
No one cared to tell
what that was.

1681
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:46,858
How many times must I pour
cold water on myself?

1682
02:00:50,535 --> 02:00:52,867
How many times should I pour
cold water on myself?

1683
02:01:14,017 --> 02:01:16,930
Come on, come on.. walk..lovely.

1684
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:18,886
Sudha! -Look, your father is here.

1685
02:01:19,606 --> 02:01:20,562
Your father is here.

1686
02:01:21,065 --> 02:01:22,976
Sudha! -Comng! -Have you
left something behind?

1687
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:25,726
What is it? -Shankarshan..

1688
02:01:26,571 --> 02:01:27,561
Take her inside.

1689
02:01:27,572 --> 02:01:28,653
Come. -But..

1690
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,448
Father.. -I was playing with her.

1691
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:33,612
I want to talk to you, father.

1692
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:37,537
Did someone come to
see me last night?

1693
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:44,502
Did my client Mr Kale drop by?

1694
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:49,507
Maybe..

1695
02:01:50,261 --> 02:01:55,131
Not maybe.
He did. And you threw him out.

1696
02:01:56,976 --> 02:02:01,265
I only asked him not to
sit in the veranda.

1697
02:02:01,606 --> 02:02:06,601
I work from home.
So where else will my clients sit?

1698
02:02:07,862 --> 02:02:09,478
Don't they have any manners?

1699
02:02:10,698 --> 02:02:13,065
Asking the women of the
house for water.

1700
02:02:14,702 --> 02:02:15,783
Who did they ask?

1701
02:02:21,793 --> 02:02:24,330
Answer me. Who did they ask?

1702
02:02:24,337 --> 02:02:25,293
Shankarsharan..

1703
02:02:25,296 --> 02:02:28,254
..don't you unnecessarily
raise your voice on me.

1704
02:02:28,675 --> 02:02:29,631
I will.

1705
02:02:30,844 --> 02:02:32,084
He asked aunt Uma, right?

1706
02:02:33,096 --> 02:02:35,508
It's fine if he had asked my wife.

1707
02:02:36,057 --> 02:02:40,972
But no man should ever talk to
aunt Uma or even look at her.

1708
02:02:41,437 --> 02:02:42,472
Why? -Look here..

1709
02:02:43,565 --> 02:02:46,648
Just because you're a barrister,
don't think you are smart.

1710
02:02:48,945 --> 02:02:50,435
You don't understand some things.

1711
02:02:53,658 --> 02:02:54,614
True.

1712
02:02:56,661 --> 02:02:58,197
I've never understood
the way you behaved.

1713
02:03:00,331 --> 02:03:03,244
I'm doing this for her own good.

1714
02:03:05,295 --> 02:03:06,501
What good has it done her?

1715
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:08,419
Tell me.

1716
02:03:09,716 --> 02:03:12,048
Look at her state.
Just look at her.

1717
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:15,176
Can't you see?

1718
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:19,055
Why have you covered your eyes?

1719
02:03:21,436 --> 02:03:24,098
Sankarshan! Sankarshan!

1720
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:26,976
Get the doctor!

1721
02:03:27,233 --> 02:03:30,521
Uma's nose is bleeding.
Call the doctor.

1722
02:03:31,571 --> 02:03:33,653
What do we do now?

1723
02:03:33,823 --> 02:03:36,531
Look at what she's
done to herself.

1724
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:39,364
She doesn't eat or drink.

1725
02:03:48,004 --> 02:03:51,713
Sankarshan,
she must eat something.

1726
02:03:53,468 --> 02:03:54,754
Not eating will not do.

1727
02:03:55,178 --> 02:03:56,794
We've tried everything, uncle.

1728
02:03:57,889 --> 02:03:58,924
She refuses to listen.

1729
02:03:59,557 --> 02:04:00,513
Take her to Mumbai.

1730
02:04:04,729 --> 02:04:06,515
Aunt, did you hear that?

1731
02:04:07,732 --> 02:04:08,972
We'll have to go to Mumbai.

1732
02:04:09,567 --> 02:04:10,648
If you don't eat.

1733
02:04:12,028 --> 02:04:13,189
Eat something at least.

1734
02:04:22,205 --> 02:04:23,286
Aunt Namu...

1735
02:04:26,417 --> 02:04:27,452
Aunt Namu..

1736
02:04:28,002 --> 02:04:30,710
What is it? -How is she..Uma?

1737
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,917
She'd be better if she ate.

1738
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:34,756
Meaning?

1739
02:04:35,259 --> 02:04:37,751
She has had no food or
water for three days.

1740
02:04:50,775 --> 02:04:52,311
Okay. Shall I leave? -Mr. Khare..

1741
02:04:53,528 --> 02:04:55,360
The hearing is in fifteen days.

1742
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:59,027
Wasn't it today?
-I had it postponed.

1743
02:04:59,742 --> 02:05:01,483
I'm taking my aunt to
the nearby town.

1744
02:05:01,786 --> 02:05:02,742
What about my case?

1745
02:05:03,246 --> 02:05:06,409
Don't worry about that.
Everything will be fine.

1746
02:05:07,041 --> 02:05:08,247
I'll be seeing you. -Okay.

1747
02:05:10,795 --> 02:05:12,832
You solely took the decision
of taking..

1748
02:05:12,839 --> 02:05:14,295
..Uma to see a doctor in town?

1749
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:21,841
She won't live if I don't.

1750
02:05:23,141 --> 02:05:24,472
The doctor says..

1751
02:05:24,684 --> 02:05:26,425
..if she doesn't eat, she will..

1752
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:29,766
..have to be in a hospital
on a drip.

1753
02:05:31,983 --> 02:05:33,098
Wait for a day.

1754
02:05:35,611 --> 02:05:36,817
We'll find a solution.

1755
02:05:41,993 --> 02:05:43,028
E

1756
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:46,570
E

1757
02:05:55,339 --> 02:05:57,797
Is it you? Or am I seeing things?

1758
02:05:58,342 --> 02:06:00,424
I will not say that..

1759
02:06:01,721 --> 02:06:02,927
..forget the past and forgive me.

1760
02:06:05,892 --> 02:06:08,554
I won't forgive you anyway.

1761
02:06:14,108 --> 02:06:16,190
Uma hasn't eaten for two weeks.

1762
02:06:18,321 --> 02:06:19,561
She won't listen to anyone.

1763
02:06:21,115 --> 02:06:22,401
You tell her.

1764
02:06:23,868 --> 02:06:24,949
She might listen to you.

1765
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:27,827
So it's all right
if I talk to her?

1766
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:33,245
It's for her own good.

1767
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:38,330
I'll get ready.

1768
02:06:52,563 --> 02:06:53,849
Uncle Jaanu, where is he?

1769
02:06:55,483 --> 02:06:56,473
Shall we go?

1770
02:06:59,445 --> 02:07:00,310
Yes.

1771
02:07:01,405 --> 02:07:02,440
Let's go.

1772
02:07:12,458 --> 02:07:13,448
Uma.

1773
02:07:13,918 --> 02:07:14,874
Uma.

1774
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:16,413
Look who has come.

1775
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:20,588
Your uncle Balwant.

1776
02:07:22,677 --> 02:07:23,917
Someone here told me..

1777
02:07:23,928 --> 02:07:26,465
..that Uma is not eating.
I said, how can that be?

1778
02:07:27,265 --> 02:07:29,802
Her uncle Balwant is here.
He will feed her now.

1779
02:07:30,393 --> 02:07:31,724
Hari asked me to come.

1780
02:07:31,727 --> 02:07:33,183
He asked me to visit you.

1781
02:07:33,437 --> 02:07:34,723
Said she misses you.

1782
02:07:35,314 --> 02:07:36,429
Will you eat now?

1783
02:07:38,526 --> 02:07:42,645
Balwant, never mind the food..

1784
02:07:43,406 --> 02:07:47,195
..make her drink a glass
of milk at least.

1785
02:07:47,702 --> 02:07:51,491
Come, drink some milk.

1786
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,412
Come. Get up.

1787
02:07:54,458 --> 02:07:55,914
Careful. Come on.

1788
02:07:57,795 --> 02:07:58,830
Oh!

1789
02:08:11,601 --> 02:08:12,636
Did she eat?

1790
02:08:15,354 --> 02:08:16,515
She won't listen to me.

1791
02:08:18,357 --> 02:08:20,143
She has lost the will to live.

1792
02:08:23,529 --> 02:08:24,519
Listen to me.

1793
02:08:24,947 --> 02:08:28,281
Shop your obstinacy
and talk to her.

1794
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:30,946
She will only listen to you.

1795
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:34,446
She will eat if you tell her.

1796
02:08:35,875 --> 02:08:36,865
How can I talk to her?

1797
02:08:40,463 --> 02:08:41,453
In front of her..

1798
02:08:43,591 --> 02:08:45,958
I don't have the courage
to face her.

1799
02:08:46,802 --> 02:08:47,963
Find the courage then.

1800
02:08:49,138 --> 02:08:53,006
If you want her to live,
you must talk to her right now.

1801
02:09:42,483 --> 02:09:43,848
I am your criminal.

1802
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:47,276
If you must punish someone,
punish me.

1803
02:09:47,822 --> 02:09:49,529
I'll do as you please.

1804
02:09:50,574 --> 02:09:52,190
Don't ruin your health..

1805
02:09:53,494 --> 02:09:57,738
..by not eating or drinking.
Don't worry us all the more.

1806
02:10:01,419 --> 02:10:02,375
I know..

1807
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:06,292
..I've been very unfair to you.

1808
02:10:08,718 --> 02:10:11,426
I understood everything
but could do nothing.

1809
02:10:12,471 --> 02:10:13,632
I was helpless.

1810
02:10:16,058 --> 02:10:17,048
I..

1811
02:10:19,061 --> 02:10:20,096
..got trapped by my own oath.

1812
02:10:26,027 --> 02:10:27,358
Before he could touch you..

1813
02:10:29,363 --> 02:10:31,354
..Mahadev passed away.

1814
02:10:33,159 --> 02:10:34,615
When the last rites
were performed..

1815
02:10:35,328 --> 02:10:38,116
..not a single crow was seen to
complete the funeral ritual.

1816
02:10:39,832 --> 02:10:43,120
I know his soul was still
attached to you.

1817
02:10:45,421 --> 02:10:47,753
How could I console him?

1818
02:10:50,384 --> 02:10:52,091
It was nearly noon.

1819
02:10:53,054 --> 02:10:54,886
A thousand thoughts invaded me.

1820
02:10:55,723 --> 02:10:57,088
So I whispered to his soul.

1821
02:10:58,809 --> 02:11:02,427
Mahadev, don't worry.

1822
02:11:04,607 --> 02:11:06,393
Uma will always be yours.

1823
02:11:08,069 --> 02:11:10,060
She will join you one day..

1824
02:11:11,364 --> 02:11:14,152
She will come to you untouched
by any man.

1825
02:11:15,326 --> 02:11:16,612
I promise you.

1826
02:11:20,456 --> 02:11:21,571
Just then a crow flew down..

1827
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:24,119
..and the rituals were completed.

1828
02:11:25,419 --> 02:11:27,581
From that moment..

1829
02:11:28,881 --> 02:11:30,337
..I decided to protect
you forever.

1830
02:11:32,134 --> 02:11:33,966
I didn't allow Shantu
to shave your head.

1831
02:11:35,888 --> 02:11:37,970
People thought I was defying
age-old tradition.

1832
02:11:40,184 --> 02:11:43,802
But I stopped him because I didn't
want any man to touch you.

1833
02:11:47,817 --> 02:11:49,182
I didn't let you go to
your maternal house..

1834
02:11:49,693 --> 02:11:50,683
I kept you here.

1835
02:11:52,154 --> 02:11:54,566
You were a part of our family,
and it was forever.

1836
02:11:56,158 --> 02:11:59,025
I didn't let you go to any
ceremony or to see relatives.

1837
02:12:00,162 --> 02:12:02,699
I didn't let you go even
to the temple alone.

1838
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:09,372
I broke ties with my
friend Balwant.

1839
02:12:10,464 --> 02:12:12,046
I doubted him without reason.

1840
02:12:14,927 --> 02:12:17,168
I told everyone I was
a progressive man.

1841
02:12:19,765 --> 02:12:21,096
Refusing to sacrifice a buffalo.

1842
02:12:23,853 --> 02:12:25,844
But I refused to discuss
your remarriage..

1843
02:12:27,273 --> 02:12:29,560
..I shut my ears to everyone.

1844
02:12:31,694 --> 02:12:34,152
When people asked
me to marry you..

1845
02:12:35,239 --> 02:12:38,322
..didn't I know your eyes
told me you were willing?

1846
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:45,197
I could feel your love in
everything you did for me.

1847
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:50,919
I could not marry you
though I wanted to.

1848
02:12:52,590 --> 02:12:53,751
I stopped talking to you.

1849
02:12:54,884 --> 02:12:57,091
I didn't trust myself not to act..

1850
02:12:58,095 --> 02:13:00,211
..in a moment of weakness.

1851
02:13:04,059 --> 02:13:05,970
I kept my promise to Mahadev..

1852
02:13:07,271 --> 02:13:09,478
..till this very minute.

1853
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:13,857
I gave peace to a dead man..

1854
02:13:15,738 --> 02:13:18,355
..while taking your
life day by day.

1855
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:21,991
I wasn't fair to you.

1856
02:13:22,578 --> 02:13:23,568
But no longer..

1857
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:30,332
I don't care if Mahadev's soul
suffers in turmoil..

1858
02:13:30,336 --> 02:13:32,202
_.for eternity by me
breaking my promise.

1859
02:13:33,422 --> 02:13:37,256
I don't care if I burn in hell
for breaking my oath.

1860
02:13:45,643 --> 02:13:46,633
But today..

1861
02:13:55,444 --> 02:13:56,479
Right now..

1862
02:13:57,571 --> 02:13:59,232
I will marry you.

1863
02:14:07,081 --> 02:14:08,116
Don't be stubborn.

1864
02:14:10,459 --> 02:14:11,620
Eat something.

1865
02:14:55,546 --> 02:14:56,627
I'll be back..

1866
02:14:59,925 --> 02:15:00,915
_.in a moment.

1867
02:15:51,685 --> 02:15:53,676
Why are you crying like
this for no reason?

1868
02:15:57,274 --> 02:15:58,355
Aunt has passed away.

1869
02:16:02,738 --> 02:16:04,024
Don't say such things.

1870
02:16:05,407 --> 02:16:06,818
Uma! Uma!

1871
02:16:08,410 --> 02:16:09,445
Uma! Wake up!

1872
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:15,201
Open your eyes, Uma.

1873
02:16:15,959 --> 02:16:18,417
Get up. Open your eyes.

1874
02:16:20,714 --> 02:16:21,795
Sankarshan..

1875
02:16:22,716 --> 02:16:26,334
Shankarshan, light a fire.
Her hands are cold.

1876
02:16:27,471 --> 02:16:28,836
She was angry with me but..

1877
02:16:30,099 --> 02:16:31,589
But not anymore, right?

1878
02:16:34,687 --> 02:16:37,224
I went to get the
Mangalsutra and..

1879
02:16:38,565 --> 02:16:39,600
Father..

1880
02:16:41,402 --> 02:16:43,769
Father, she's left us.

1881
02:16:45,989 --> 02:16:47,150
She has passed away..

1882
02:17:05,759 --> 02:17:08,342
Wake up, Uma. Wake up.

1883
02:17:11,223 --> 02:17:15,262
She won't wake up now.

1884
02:17:55,559 --> 02:18:00,395
I must tell you something that's
been eating me up for years.

1885
02:18:04,234 --> 02:18:09,445
Leaving Uma when I went inside
to fetch Tara's Mangalsutra..

1886
02:18:11,492 --> 02:18:12,857
..at that moment Uma's condition..

1887
02:18:15,329 --> 02:18:19,493
..was not critical.

1888
02:18:20,751 --> 02:18:21,741
You know that too.

1889
02:18:23,545 --> 02:18:28,335
Yet she died before I
returned to the room.

1890
02:18:31,470 --> 02:18:32,460
Do you know why?

1891
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:36,547
So that I do not break my
oath I made to Mahadev.

1892
02:18:44,817 --> 02:18:48,776
I treated her so badly all
through her life, yet..

1893
02:18:50,364 --> 02:18:54,483
..she loved me to the very end.

1894
02:18:58,038 --> 02:19:00,530
I haven't slept a moment
since that night.

1895
02:19:12,261 --> 02:19:13,547
I sold my house.

1896
02:19:15,597 --> 02:19:17,338
Sold my land.

1897
02:19:19,601 --> 02:19:20,557
I started this organisation.

1898
02:19:21,562 --> 02:19:23,803
I dedicated my life..

1899
02:19:25,315 --> 02:19:26,521
.. to helping women like Uma.

1900
02:19:27,943 --> 02:19:29,308
But even today when
I close my eyes..

1901
02:19:30,779 --> 02:19:32,440
..I still see Uma's face.

1902
02:19:40,539 --> 02:19:44,828
I pace up and down all
night to tire myself.

1903
02:19:47,254 --> 02:19:48,585
But I cannot sleep.

1904
02:19:51,842 --> 02:19:53,048
When I met Manda today..

1905
02:19:54,428 --> 02:19:55,463
..I decided..

1906
02:19:57,472 --> 02:19:58,462
..to give this woman..

1907
02:20:00,642 --> 02:20:05,182
The grand daughter of the man
who made my life a misery..

1908
02:20:07,149 --> 02:20:12,269
..my wife's wedding necklace that
I had preserved all along.

1909
02:20:17,492 --> 02:20:18,402
Let us see..

1910
02:20:19,703 --> 02:20:21,364
If I can sleep tonight.

1911
02:20:42,851 --> 02:20:49,769
Oh, world, married life.."
-"Oh, world, married life.."

1912
02:20:49,775 --> 02:20:52,938
"..is like a pan on
a burning fire."

1913
02:20:53,111 --> 02:20:55,978
"Is like a pan on
a burning fire.."

1914
02:20:56,657 --> 02:20:59,615
"Only by singeing
your fingers.."..

1915
02:20:59,618 --> 02:21:02,610
.. -"0nly by singeing
your fingers.."

1916
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:09,663
"..can you bake bread."
-Can you bake bread."

1917
02:21:10,087 --> 02:21:12,749
Oh, married life..

1918
02:21:13,090 --> 02:21:17,835
"Oh, married life.."

1919
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,116
