Your mom must be really surprised.

43

Are you surprised?

44
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,270
I prepared this so I can make a surprise party with Dad.

Are you alright?
Where did you go early in the morning?

57

Did you go to the broadcasting station?

58

What?

60
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,420
She died.
She died for sure.

61
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,480
We did the cremation and the funeral.

62
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,980
What are you talking about?
Saet Byul died?

63

Dream?

65
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,720
What kind of dream is this?

66
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,400
Get back to your senses.

67
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,420
Is this all a dream?

68
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,220
She didn't iron my white shirt.

69
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,090
Something is wrong.

70
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,700
What is?

71
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,900
It's 2 weeks before.

72
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,810
2 weeks before?

73
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,580
Yeah.

74
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,470
Today is my birthday, so

75
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,340
before this day, it is exactly two weeks before.

76
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,700
This day, our Saet Byul died.

77
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,110
I remember it clearly.

78
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,950
What do you mean by she died?
Why would our Saet Byul die?

79
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,430
You keep on saying unlucky stuff in the morning.

80
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,230
It's true.
I don't even know what's going on.

81
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,980
You should sleep first.
Let's talk later.

82
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,250
Honey...

83
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,480
Why did you come out?
I told you to rest.

84
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,010
Mom, have you seen my journal?

85
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,610
<i>Mom, have you seen my journal?</i>

86
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,260
<i>It's over there.</i>

87
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,750
<i>Ah!</i>

88
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,920
It's over there.

89
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,100
No, Saet Byul!

90
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,030
Are you alright?

91
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,700
Saet Byul, get some cold water.

92
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,930
<i>Oh my!</i>

93
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,500
Ow...

94
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,560
Saet Byul!

95
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,700
<i>Is your hand okay?</i>

96
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,500
<i>-Are you alright?
-It's bleeding.</i>

97
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,410
It's so distracting.

98
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,140
It's distracting, right?

99
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,380
It's okay. Listen to it.
No.

100
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,370
Mom, a birthday present.

101
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,810
A present?

102
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,990
Yeah.

103
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,820
It looks just like regular pen, right?

104
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,550
<i>If you press it a super laser comes out.</i>

105
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,850
<i>Shoot!</i>

106
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,190
If you press this in the back,

107
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,580
it shoots a super laser!

108
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,500
It's repeating.

109
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,280
Mom...

110
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,370
<i>In the alley in Gangnam,</i>

111
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,580

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,840
<i>Today, at 6:00 AM,</i>

113

114
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,640
What's wrong, Mom?

115
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
No.

116
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,930
It can't be.

117
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,700
<i>What is this?</i>

118
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,280
<i>What is this?</i>

119
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,920
<i>How is it?
Do you like the surprise present?</i>

120
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,530
<i>You said you wanted a bag from there.</i>

121
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,880
<i>Thank you, Honey.</i>

122
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,980
What's wrong, Mom?

123
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,750
Mom...

124
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,840
No.

125
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,990
No, no...

126
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,420
Mom,

127
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,090
what's wrong?

128
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,320
It's Eun Joo.

129
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,900
It's a dog.

130
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,640
Welcome.

131
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,140
I think you're misunderstanding this cafe to another cafe.

132
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,660
But this cafe is the only cafe in this area.

133
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,690
It's weird.

134
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,980
This is the place for sure.

135
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,890
What happened?

136
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,790
Unni.
Saet Byul.

137
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,120
I'm sorry.
Today is your resting day,

138
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,530
but I can't get in touch with that person.

139
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,380
You're the only one I can leave her with.

140
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,990
What is it, Unni?

141
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,160
I'll explain everything later. 
Just look after my Saet Byeol.

142
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,020
Don't go out until I come back, okay?

143
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,040
You can't go in. Stay behind the police tape...

144
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,450
Excuse me, the woman who died here,

145
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,100
was she wearing it?

146
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,320
That... that leopard printed dress!

147
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,280
her hair came up to her shoulders, and...

148
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,670
That's right!

149
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,140
There was a stab wound on her face.

150
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,370
Was it below her right side of her jaw?

151
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,730
Like this.

152
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,570
Was she laying down like this?

153
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,960
Are you a witness?

154
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,850
Am I right?

155
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,510
It's not that...

156
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,900
What's wrong?
Let go!

157
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,170
Let go of me!

158
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,270
Let me go!

159
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,450
I'm telling you the truth.

160
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,420
Tomorrow, that guy, wait...

161
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,510
Tonight, he'll kill a woman again.

162
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,040
So, listen to me and catch him immediately.

163
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,220
You have to catch him for my daughter to be safe.

164
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,280
So, the criminal for this case,

165
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,090
will kill two more women tomorrow, 
and then your daughter?

166
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,100
Yes.
-I see.

167
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,500
How do you know the events that'll happen so well?

168
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,960
I'm being serious. Think about it.
 If it's not so, how did I

169
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,150
know what clothes that woman
 was wearing and how she died?

170
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,120
That's why, how did you know?

171
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,730
Something that the reporters don't even know.

172
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,650
Unless you're the criminal...

173
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,500
The criminal?
-Yes.

174
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,190
There isn't any other way to explain this, right?

175
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,690
Pretend to be fooled and

176
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,590
just listen to what I'm saying...

177
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,500
If you find out where the R Club is and hide there,

178
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,780
you'll know if I'm right or not.
-Ah, really!

179
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,760
If you keep saying this,

180
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,050
you may be arrested for being the real criminal.
-What?

181
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,770
Even if we take everything you've said into account, it's more than enough to arrest you.

182
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,580
You would have to come stay here for a few days.

183
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,330
And if you get sent to the prosecutor,

184
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,730
it's really complicated!

185
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,690
Just believe me!

186
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,190
I'm going crazy, seriously!

187
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:15,620
These people! They really tried to kill me by throwing me in the lake!

188
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,220
Not just that, they tied a rock this big on me and dropped me into the water!

189
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,550
If this isn't attempted murder, what is it?

190
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,680
Ah, I'm going to go crazy.

191
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,350
I mean... at first meeting, why would we?!

192
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,050
For what reason would we drop you into the water?!

193
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,830
Our first meeting? Look at these guys. That jerk who cheated.

194
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,660
Your boss said it.

195
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,290
To completely drop me into the water... you said I was

196
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,910
waterproof!

197
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,510
Cheat?

198
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,750
The two of us?

199
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,550
Hey, these guys could

200
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,120
clean up at the Academy Awards for their acting.

201
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,080
Hey, Huh Goo, why aren't you looking at... ?

202
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,750
Ahjumma.

203
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,650
You're alive!

204
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,910
Oh...

205
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,400
You're here, Ahjumma.

206
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,700
You disappeared so suddenly, 
 so I thought you went into the lake again.

207
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,960
I'm glad to see you again.

208
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,910
Now that we met again and you're alive,

209
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,780
I'm even more glad.

210
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,500
Ahjumma, don't you remember me?

211
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,710
I saved you.

212
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,740
I'm pretty upset that you don't recognize me.

213
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,170
I went to call 119 (911), and it that time you had disappeared and weren't there.

214
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,560
Oh yeah,

215
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,480
you beggar like bastards.

216
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,710
You can't get out of this one.

217
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,860
This woman is a witness.

218
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,170
Hey, Huh Goo, hurry up and take those two gangsters statements.

219
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,490
Is that true?

220
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,690
Ahjumeoni,

221
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,130
tell it how you saw it, okay?

222
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,540
I don't know what you're on about.

223
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,210
Ahjumma, why... ?

224
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,900
I've never been to that lake that you're talking about, and

225
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,690
I've never seen those guys before, either.

226
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,050
Why are you being like this?

227
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,760
I pulled you out, who had jumped into the water to commit suicide with my own two hands, now what are you saying?

228
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,850
Why would I kill myself?

229
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,730
It seems you saw a person wrong.

230
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,120
Wow, look at this woman's nerve pretending not to know me.

231
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,040
You can't do this to your life's savior.

232
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,500
This woman won't do, this ahjumma.

233
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,340
Sir, how long do we have to continue
 listening to a crazy psycho?

234
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,090
Are you going to arrest these

235
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,070
innocent citizens?

236
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,570
Right, you can go back.

237
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,610
Hey, what are you doing?

238
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,660
You can't just let them go! They're 
guilty of attempted murder!

239
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,000
Hey, you! According to whom, 
are you just letting them go, huh?

240
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,200
They all have an alibi for today.

241
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,900
They were all in Seoul today.

242
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,000
Hey, tell me honestly,

243
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
you were bribed by them, right?

244
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,930
How much did you get paid?

245
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,880
What?

246
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
You're going too far!

247
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,080
I let go of you because you're a sunbae!

248
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,730
What, you bastard?
Sunbae?

249
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,430
Why am I your Sunbae, when I'm 
not even a police officer anymore?

250
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,790
<i>Were you really a policeman!
- Let me go! Are you not going to let me go!</i>

251
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,690
Wow...
How did that bastard become like that?

252
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,580
He was one of the greatest homicide police officers in Seoul.

253
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,940
Really?

254
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,110
That person?

255
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,430
Of course.

256
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,970
Ki Dong Chan was one of the legends in Seoul.

257
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,120
He was a true legend.

258
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,230
He's better at fighting than the gangsters.

259
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,080
He's smarter than the criminals and is usually one step ahead of them.

260
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,840
There's probably no on like Ki Dong Chan here.

261
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,730
Where is that woman?

262
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,930
She is waiting because she wants to talk to Team Leader.

263
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,240
It's been about 10 years, right?

264
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,580
I thought that once in a lifetime, I might meet you.

265
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,350
I saw a few times your name coming out in broadcast.

266
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,260
It felt great.
You became a writer.

267
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,380
The atmosphere changed a lot.

268
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,520
Where did that gangster looking student go?

269
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,590
I like that better.

270
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,960
<i>Where did that gangster looking student go?</i>

271
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,370
<i>I liked that better.</i>

272
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,730
It hasn't been 10 years.

273
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,180
What?

274
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,440
We've met in the broadcasting station before.

275
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,810
And that place, the words you just spoke,

276
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,560
you said the same thing.

277
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,840
What are you talking about?

278
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,560
You won't be able to understand

279
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,080
the words I am telling you, even if I explain it.

280
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,760
I will tell you in detail later.

281
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,970
So, please believe everything I'm telling.

282
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,620
Please.

283
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:18,150
So, you're back two weeks before you daughter died, right?

284
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,650
So, you knew the murder cases were going to happen.

285
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,230
Is that what you're saying?

286
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,190
You haven't changed at all.

287
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,370
10 years and now.

288
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,230
Rubbing your hands with your nose,

289
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,080
is the habit that happens when you're trying to believe what I'm saying when I am lying.

290
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:04,910
Who would believe what I say, when even my husband doesn't believe me?

291
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,870
Please let me out.

292
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,280
Ahjumma, lower it.

293
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,420
This...

294
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,360
Ahjumma, please take me to the subway nearby.

295
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,320
It's bothering to have a fight in front of the police station.

296
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,540
I'm getting in.

297
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,020
I'm getting in.
Thanks.

298
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,980
You wretch!

299
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,860
Leaving me here to die like this.

300
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,780
You bastard!

301
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,390
Come on now guys.

302
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,510
Catch him!

303
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,000
You bastard!

304
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,010
You bastard!

305
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,340
Hey!
Stay right there!

306
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,300
They're so disgusting!

307
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,960
I'm going, bye!

308
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:52,780
You're making such a dirty fuss with just this one newspaper!

309
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,130
Why is the news like this today?

310
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,430
Let's look.
Today's luck is?

311
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,350
Today is...

312
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:06,150
an important day that will make you meet a person who will change your destiny.

313
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,760
A person who will change my destiny?

314
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,830
Who is it?

315
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,680
What is this?

316
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,080
It's a newspaper that is one month old.

317
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,740
<i>Citizen's union on criminal safety. Demand on executions!!!</i>

318
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,980
<i>They're going to do an execution.</i>

319
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,120
<i>Dong Ho hyung is going to be executed today.</i>

320
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,740
<i> My brother is a prison guard. </i>

321
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,430
<i>I took a peek at the list.</i>

322
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,930
<i>It's total of 5 people.
The last person in the list is Dong Ho hyung.</i>

323
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,640
Did Grandma...

324
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,130
say anything?

325
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,910
What?

326
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,810
About your dad?

327
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,550
Dad?

328
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,680
Grandma is a liar.

329
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,860
She always says that I can meet my dad after sleeping 10 nights.

330
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,080
Maybe Dad forgot Young Gyu.

331
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,880
Young Gyu misses Dad.

332
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,790
Uncle, are you crying?

333
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,420
Are you crying because you want to see Dad, too?

334
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,720



335
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,550
No.

336
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,670
It's because this is spicy.

337
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:02,140
Even the smell is spicy.

338
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,420
It's not really spicy.

339
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,080
Pack only the things you really need right away.

340
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,650
Later, I will ask Dad to bring them.

341
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,320
Are we really going to Hawaii?

342
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,350
What about school?

343
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,120
I told the school already.

344
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,390
Hurry up and pack your things.

345
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,370
Hey!
Can you eat jjajangmyun after working like that?

346
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,640
What's wrong?

347
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,260
Hey, that woman,

348
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,740
didn't you check that her husband was the boss of a gang?

349
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,020
If we get a client, I told you to do a background check on the client, you jerk!

350
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,760
I almost died because of that adulteress!

351
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,570
When did we get a request about adultery?

352
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,460
We haven't had a single customer for a month! Not even a single fly!

353
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,450
You guys are both trying to play a joke on me?

354
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:40,040
Hey, the day when we were eating jjajjangmyun,
did a lady wearing a blue clothing and a black miniskirt come in?

355
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,050
That she was committing adultery, she looked just
 like this...Oh my!

356
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,600
Why are you here?

357
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,860
Why, again?

358
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,920
Oh, welcome!
Have a seat.

359
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,460
What do you mean 'have a seat'?

360
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,420
How can you come back here?

361
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,280
I'm really going to die.

362
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,230
What are you saying?

363
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,060
Do you want some tea?

364
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,670
Jenny, get her some Earl Grey.

365
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,580
Ahjumma... no, ma'am,

366
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,030
why did you...

367
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,590
say those things to your husband?
What would become of me?

368
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,320
That day, I only...

369
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,400
I don't even remember that day.
The day I gave you the pictures.

370
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,480
I ate the first meal and after the day was over...

371
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,630
You bastard, didn't I tell you rip off last month's calender?

372
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,840
What are you talking about?
There's nothing wrong with the calendar.

373
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,890
Are you joking around?

374
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,650
That's this month's calendar?

375
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,700
<i>[ March 10th, 2014, Monday ]</i>

376
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,290
Jenny,

377
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,720
today is really...

378
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,590
March 10th?

379
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,020
No way, it can't be.

380
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,910
No way, it is.

381
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,560
What's wrong with you?

382
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,390
Today, let's get to the point,

383
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,260
Is today perhaps...

384
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,300
the first time you're coming here?

385
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,260
Yes.

386
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,070
Is this my first time meeting you?

387
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,370
Of course.
Do you know me?

388
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,910
Then the reason you came here is

389
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,110
to catch your husband cheating?

390
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,470
How do you know that?

391
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,420
Is your husband right now...

392
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,670
living as boss of a gang?

393
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,060
Oh my!

394
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,470
Is this a fortune telling place, not an errand center?

395
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,830
Hey, this is not a joke right?

396
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,410
Hyung, what are you?
Are you possessed by a spirit?

397
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,030
Please hurry up and leave!

398
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,450
Go away!

399
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,950
Can you be like this to a customer?

400
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,380
I can't accept the work so go!

401
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,480
Hurry up and leave!

402
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,500
Hey, Hyung Tae,

403
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,210
is today really March 10th?

404
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,060
Why do you keep on asking?

405
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,820
What is this?

406
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,570
What happened?

407
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,550
Perhaps...

408
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,760
No, it can't be!

409
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,440
It doesn't make sense.

410
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,000
<i></i>

411
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,850
Hello?

412
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,930
<i>You bastard, there's no more rice!</i>

413
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,900
<i>Hurry up and buy some rice and make some food.</i>

414
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,570
<i> Buy some meat, too! Korean beef! </i>

415
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,750
<i>After eating only rice,</i>

416
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,960
<i>the sound of a cow keeps coming out of my mouth.</i>

417
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,640
This grandpa.

418
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,510
Keep acting up like that!

419
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,750
That grandpa died...

420
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,580
<i>What are you doing?</i>

421
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,260
It's real.

422
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,890
This is real!

423
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,250
I'm getting goosebumps!

424
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,930
If this grandpa is alive,

425
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,530
then I get my 10 billion KW.
(10 million dollars)

426
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,230
This is 10 billion KW!
(10 million dollars)

427
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,830
Ah, 10 billion KW!

428
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,650
It's 10 billion KW!

429
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,450
It's finished now.

430
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,740
Do you want some ice cream?

431
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,630
Yes.

432
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,110
Wow!

433
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,480
Wow, Grandpa!

434
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,130
Wow!

435
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,350
Wow, Grandpa!

436
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,710
Move aside!

437
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,430
Are you crazy?
Why are you all of a sudden like this?

438
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,170
Wait a minute.

439
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,350
Grandpa, this...

440
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:35,410
is grande size of caramel macchiato with a lot of whip cream.

441
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,140
And this is... do you see the marbling?

442
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,200
This is top grade Korean beef with great marbling.

443
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,110
You... did you eat something bad?

444
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,150
Grandpa,

445
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,900
these past days,

446
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,130
I've made you very sad, right?

447
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,750
Please forget everything.
Forget everything and

448
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,980
live comfortably thinking this place is your home.

449
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,720
I thought about it and

450
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,710
in that short period of time, I have such deep sentiment towards you, Gramps.

451
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,340
Even though we don't look alike,

452
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,350
you seem like my father.

453
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,180
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

454
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,320
So, from today on,

455
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,720
I am quitting the Supporter thingy.

456
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,920
I'm going to live as a good person from now on?

457
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,010
I am going to do some volunteer work.

458
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,100
I'm going to attend the church now.

459
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,350
Now, I'm going to become a new person.

460
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,220
Would you please watch over me?

461
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,470
Are you sick anywhere?

462
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,340
No, I'm fine.

463
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,660
So,

464
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,300
our grandpa,

465
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,960
do you have anything to say

466
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,710
to me?

467
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,340
What?

468
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,890
Think about it.
You have something to tell me.

469
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,110
I do.

470
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,950
You do?
Yes, you do.

471
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:57,240
Say it comfortably.
I will listen to it.

472
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,900
Go to the hospital.

473
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,480
I think you are mentally ill.

474
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,490
I'm fine!

475
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,500
What's wrong, Grandpa?

476
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,530
Are you sick anywhere?

477
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,180
I need to poop.

478
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,110
Right, go poop. Relieve yourself.

479
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,420
Don't put in too much strength.

480
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,790
<i></i>

481
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,620
He'll probably say it tomorrow.

482
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,680
I'll be patient for one day.

483
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:41,050
<i>The honorable CEO Choo Byeong Woo died of a chronic heart problem.</i>

484
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,650
Right... heart failure.

485
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,680
Wait a minute.

486
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,630



487
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,610
He died on this day.

488
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,380
Ah, what should I do?

489
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,020
Give this to me.

490
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,340
What are you doing?
There's no taking back.

491
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,150
Give that back.

492
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,000
Do you know how bad coffee is for your heart?

493
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,160
This is poison!

494
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,250
Saet Byul!

495
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,670
Passenger, are you alright?

496
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,030
Did you feed her something?

497
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,210
Yes, I gave her some ice cream.

498
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,600
What kind of ice cream?

499
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,580
It was nut ice cream.

500
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,740
She has a nut allergy.

501
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,580
I think it's anaphylactic shock.

502
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,020
We need to go to the hospital quickly.

503
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,300
What?

504
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,960
Saet Byul..

505
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,160
Saet Byul...

506
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,300
<i>This is the pilot speaking.</i>

507
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,040
We have an emergency patient in this airplane
so we have to go back to Incheon airport.

508
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,390
<i>This is the captain speaking.</i>

509
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,650
<i>This plane is returning to Incheon airport.</i>

510
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,870
Every situation is repeating.

511
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,500
Me getting a burn,
your white shirt getting a hole,

512
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,450
the vase... No, it's a glass cup...

513
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,750
Our Saet Byul getting cut.

514
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,510
And the present you and Saet Byul gave,

515
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,880
almost hitting a bicycle, the murder,

516
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,490
they are all happening.

517
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,060
Honey.

518
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,450
I have proof.

519
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,770
Look at this.
It's the picture I told you about before.

520
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,030
For sure, this is the picture me and Saet Byul took.

521
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,920
But, look.
Saet Byul is the only one not here.

522
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,210
Think about it!

523
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,940
If Saet Byul is only one who disappeared in this picture,

524
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,990
means that in two weeks...

525
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,460
She's going to die?

526
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,360
So you tried to run away to a foreign country?

527
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,940
Yeah.
If she's here,

528
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,170
she's going to be kidnapped and murdered by that murderer.

529
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,710
It's not two weeks, but

530
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,960
today that Saet Byul almost died!

531
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,000
It was because of you.

532
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,870
<i>No matter how much you try to run away and step on it,</i>

533
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,100
<i>destiny follows you know matter what.</i>

534
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,700
<i>It's no use in running away from it.</i>

535
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,070
<i>So instead of running away from it,</i>

536
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,210
<i>fight it.</i>

537
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,360
<i>Okay, let's face it.</i>

538
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,970
<i>It's no use in running away from it.</i>

539
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,930
<i>I will find that person myself</i>

540
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,430
<i>and I will change Saet Byul's fate.</i>

541
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,340
Saet Byul...

542
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,120
I will save you for sure.

543
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,950
For sure.

544
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,510
<i>The second woman victim.</i>

545
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,500
<i> She wore a skull tee with flowers. </i>

546
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,680
<i>The witness' statement,
about in the mid 20s?</i>

547
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,400
<i>In a Gangnam night club, during 9:00-10:00 PM,</i>

548
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,280
<i>witnessed in the club.</i>

549
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,180
<i>A skull tee</i>

550
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,970
Where are you going again?

551
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,440
I'm protecting Saet Byul.

552
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,230
Where are you going when the child is sick?

553
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,600
I don't care if you think of me as crazy.

554
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,580
I'm not letting Saet Byul go, a second time.

555
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,650
<i>Ki Dong Chan...</i>

556
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,780
<i>used to be a legend in Seoul in the police.</i>

557
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,940
<i>He can fight better than gangsters,</i>

558
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,260
<i>using his head,</i>

559
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,710
<i>he was always on top of the criminals' heads.</i>

560
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,830
<i>In this field,</i>

561
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,500
<i>there weren't any other cops better than him.</i>

562
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,940
I..

563
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,880
I didn't play with Saet Byul.

564
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,460
It's a problem if you don't recycle.

565
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,960
I heard that you're a human rights attorney.

566
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,500
Let me tell you something,

567
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,800
the basis of human rights start with correct public behavior.

568
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,360
What is it?

569
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,630
Aunt!

570
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,450
Yes?

571
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,900
Did you throw this away?

572
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,090
No!

573
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,330
These are all new!

574
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,450
Did Saet Byul's mom throw this away?

575
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,610
Do you like that?

576
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,960
Wear these shoes

577
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:09,300
and when someone tries to take Saet Byul away,

578
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,640
you have to run and stop them.

579
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,240
Okay?

580
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,380
Okay.

581
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,160
Let's make a promise.

582
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,660
I promise!

583
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,480
Young Gyu,

584
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,530
I'm sorry.

585
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,080
Ah, this Hyung!

586
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,250
Hyung!

587
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,990
Are you really quitting?

588
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,840
How about our overdue monthly rent?

589
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,100
What are you going to do if you quit this?

590
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,060
Volunteer work.

591
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,590
What?

592
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,010
Byeong Tae,

593
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,480
from now on,

594
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,680
I'm not going to the scenes of people committing adultery,

595
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,530
or collecting money from people.

596
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm going to live a new life.

597
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,850
Good.

598
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,980
A new life. That's good.

599
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,060
That's all good,

600
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,870
but volunteer work...

601
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,970
Oh! Hello!

602
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,290
We're closed for business.

603
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,170
Hyung! Why are you like this?

604
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,010
Ki Dong Chan...

605
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,130
Hey, Byeong Tae,

606
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,270
throw some salt here.

607
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:44,450
Because of you, I've drank tons of water and almost died. I saved your life yet you treated me like that and now you call me,

608
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,510
"Ki Dong Chan?"

609
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,490
I'm sorry, I wasn't in my right mind then.

610
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,880
It wasn't that you weren't in your right mind,

611
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,230
but it's that you're rude.

612
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,320
Go before I do something harmful to you!

613
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,780
Go...

614
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,900
Ahjussi,

615
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,290
please help me.

616
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:05,210
What do you mean help? I quit! 
 Can't you see?

617
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,630
You know...

618
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,540
that my child is dead, right?

619
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,410
You know that my child was kidnapped.

620
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:19,480
It's impossible that you don't know since it was broadcasted live.

621
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,120
I don't know. What is this woman talking about?

622
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,580
I don't know! I don't watch news.

623
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,380
You came back, too.

624
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,480
I heard from the police station.

625
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,640
We came back 2 weeks before my child was found from the lake.

626
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,980
2 weeks later... No,

627
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,530
before that, my child will die.

628
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,830
So,

629
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,030
please help me so we can catch him.

630
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,750
Why should I?

631
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,500
Why would I catch that murderer who killed 3 women...

632
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,940
Yes. The murderer who killed 3 women!

633
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,560
He'll kill my daughter.

634
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,690
So please help me.

635
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,250
You're the only one who can help me.

636
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,120
My husband, the police... they all don't believe me.

637
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,630
I don't want to.

638
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,410
Why would I meddle in someone else's business?

639
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,590
What if I get hurt? I only have one body.

640
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,650
I'll pay you as much as you want.

641
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,190
Hey, where are you showing off your money?

642
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,860
I don't need this little money,

643
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,090
so don't try to do any funny business and get away!

644
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:28,110
Are you crazy?

645
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,140
Yes.. that...

646
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,610
So your daughter will die... No,

647
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,310
it'll happen to her, right?

648
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,350
How worried are you?

649
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,670
I don't know what's going on, but if you..

650
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,930
Take it.

651
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:44,230
Take it and go. Go away.

652
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,590
Go away!

653
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,140
Get out. Get out.

654
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,730
Hey, Ki Dong Chan!

655
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:54,110
Ki Dong Chan, please!

656
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,150
Just give up.

657
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,820
My hyung, once he says no,

658
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,560
he'll never go back on it. 
He's got a stubborn personality.

659
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,180
Excuse me,

660
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,330
please tell him to contact me if he changes his mind..

661
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,410

828
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,170
I'm sure these boxes weren't here before.

829
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,660
This used to be an empty spot.

830
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,050
It's not this rubbish bin.

831
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,210
I went to all the clubs starting with "R"...

832
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,270
It's not a 'P'...It's an 'R'...

833
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,150
It must be somewhere else.. 
 What should I do?

834
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,620
<i>Ki Dong Chan</i>

835
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,470
It's scary.

836
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,560
<i> That cross necklace... </i>

837
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,090
<i>Someone saw her drinking at a 'R' club before she died.</i>

838
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,250
<i>She was apparently really drunk.</i>

839
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,810
<i>It wasn't that woman. It was her!</i>

840
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,580
<i>Wang Byeon Tae</i>

841
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,750
Excuse me, don't go!

842
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,050
You'll die if you go, please!

843
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,580
What the..

844
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,830
Aren't you leaving?

845
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:48,410
All of you are going to get screwed up.

846
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,240
What are you doing?

847
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,520
Why are you flirting with my girlfriend?

848
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,000
Huh?

849
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,070
He's on the phone, heh?

850
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:02,970
Yeah, Ahjumma.

851
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:05,840
Ki Dong Chan! It wasn't that woman!

852
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,510
Here...

853
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,350
Ahjumma!

854
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:18,470
Ahjumma!

855
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,790
Ahjumma Ahjumma!

856
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,120
Ahjumma!

857
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,710
Where are you, Ahjumma?

858
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,860
So where are you, Ajhumma?
