1
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,170
In my younger
and more vulnerable years,

2
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,282
my father gave me some advice
that I've been considering ever since.

3
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,683
"When you feel like criticising anyone,"
he told me,

4
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,444
"remember that all the people in this
world haven't had your advantages."

5
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,288
In consequence, I'm inclined
to reserve all my judgements.

6
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,490
It was by chance that I decided
to spend the summer

7
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,567
on that slender, riotous island
that juts out into the Long Island Sound,

8
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,411
20 miles due east of New York.

9
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,766
I lived at West Egg on the, well, less
fashionable side of the courtesy bay.

10
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,842
My cousin, Daisy Buchanan,

11
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,850
lived in one of East Egg's
glittering white palaces,

12
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,249
with her husband Tom,
whom I'd known in college-

13
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,882
They had spent the years since
their marriage drifting unrestfully,

14
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,010
wherever people played polo
and were rich together.

15
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,528
Nick Carraway!

16
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,042
Nick, it's about time.

17
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,567
I'm not sure how to operate that thing.

18
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,008
If you'd said, we'd have sent the
motor cruiser for you.

19
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,320
How are you?

20
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,729
- Is this all yours?
- Some of it belongs to Daisy.

21
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,526
- Where's your place?
- Across the bay.

22
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,444
Just a little cottage
I got for $80 a month.

23
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,005
$80 a month!

24
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,970
Our beer bills at New Haven
were more than that.

25
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,166
You forget,

26
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,130
I am now just a struggling bond
salesman on Wall Street.

27
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,962
Nick?

28
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,363
- Is it really you?
- It is.

29
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,286
My dear lost love!

30
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,450
I'm paralysed with happiness!

31
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,291
Jordan, this is my second cousin
once removed, Nick Carraway.

32
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,046
Does that mean we kiss when we greet?

33
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,645
I hope it means we do.

34
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,722
Tom says you've come from Chicago.
Tell me everything.

35
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,531
- Do they miss me?
- The whole town is desolate.

36
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,927
How gorgeous!

37
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,689
All the cars have their left rear wheel
painted black in mourning,

38
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,485
and there's a persistent wail all night.

39
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,804
Let's go back tomorrow, Tom.
I love a persistent wail.

40
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,962
Well, I love a drink.

41
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,168
Come on, let's all have a drink.

42
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,327
I've been lying on that sofa
for as long as I can remember.

43
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,166
You live in West Egg.
I know somebody there.

44
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,084
- I don't know anyone.
- You must know Gatsby.

45
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,682
- He's my neighbour.
- Gatsby? What Gatsby?

46
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,926
Come on, Daisy.

47
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,568
Why candles?

48
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,680
In two weeks,
it'll be the longest day in the year.

49
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,522
Do you watch for the longest day
in the year and then miss it? I do.

50
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,366
- We ought to plan something.
- All right. What'll we plan?

51
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,284
What do people plan?

52
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,050
Look at that...
My little finger, it's all black and blue.

53
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,405
You did that, Tom.

54
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,969
You didn't mean to, but that's what I get
for marrying a brute of a man.

55
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,808
- A great big hulking brute of a man.
- I hate that word "hulking".

56
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,042
Even in kidding.

57
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,568
- Hulking.
- Please, let's not start one of those.

58
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,089
Nick, have you read The Rise
of the Coloured Empires by Goddard?

59
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,408
- Why, no.
- Fine book. Everyone should read it.

60
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,884
See, the point is
that if we don't watch out,

61
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,125
the white race will be
utterly submerged... No, that's so!

62
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,611
We, the dominant race, must watch out,
or these other races will take control.

63
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,329
- We've got to beat them down.
- Daisy, it's all been scientifically proved.

64
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,601
You see, we're Nordics.
You are, and I am, and...

65
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,687
Excuse me, sir.

66
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,728
Thank you.

67
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,250
Excuse me.

68
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,811
Any Way...

69
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,442
We're responsible for everything
that made civilisation.

70
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,484
Art, science, and all that.

71
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,482
I love to see you at my table, Nick.

72
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,608
You remind me of a...

73
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,889
A rose, an absolute rose. Doesn't he?

74
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,249
You're Jordan Baker,
the golf champion...

75
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,688
Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.

76
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,684
- Is something happening?
- You don't know?

77
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,525
- I thought everyone knew.
- I don't.

78
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,648
Tom's got a woman in New York.

79
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,849
She might have the decency
not to phone him at dinner time.

80
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,802
Couldn't be helped.

81
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,850
There's a bird on the lawn.

82
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,688
I think it's a nightingale, come over
on the Cunard or the White Star Line.

83
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,682
He's singing away.

84
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,805
It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?

85
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,161
Yes, it is romantic.

86
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,806
It had been a golden afternoon.

87
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,721
I had the familiar conviction that life
was beginning again with the summer.

88
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,048
By the autumn, my mood
would be very different.

89
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,006
- Goodnight!
- Come back soon!

90
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,688
I would want no more privileged
glimpses into the human heart.

91
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,727
Only my neighbour, Gatsby,
would be exempt from my reaction.

92
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,000
Gatsby, who represented everything
for which I have an unaffected scorn.

93
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,971
For Gatsby turned out all right
in the end.

94
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,441
It was what preyed on him,

95
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,400
what foul dust floated
in the wake of his dreams.

96
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,043
At least once a fortnight,

97
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,131
a corps of caterers came
with several hundred feet of canvas

98
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,962
and enough coloured lights to make
a Christmas tree of Gatsby's gardens.

99
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,162
There was music from my neighbour's
house through those summer nights.

100
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,922
In his enchanted gardens, men and girls
came and went like moths,

101
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,402
among the whispering
and the champagne and the stars.

102
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,890
I believe few people were actually
invited to these parties, they just went.

103
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,482
They got into automobiles
which bore them to Long Island,

104
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,570
and somehow
they ended up at Gatsby's door,

105
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,931
come for the party with a simplicity of
heart that was its own admission ticket.

106
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,646
After that, they conducted themselves

107
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,163
according to the rules of behaviour
associated with an amusement park.

108
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,328
About half way between
the two Eggs and New York,

109
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,651
the motor road hastily joins the rail road
and runs beside it a short distance,

110
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,765
presided over by the eyes
of Doctor T J Eckleburg,

111
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,489
set there by some wild wag of an oculist
to fatten his practice in Queens.

112
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,649
This desolate area is a valley of ashes,

113
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,162
a fantastic farm
where ashes grow like wheat.

114
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,290
Come on in. I want you to meet my girl.

115
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,844
Wilson!

116
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,770
Wilson!

117
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,848
Wilson, old man...

118
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,810
- How's business?
- Can't complain.

119
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,091
- When will you sell me that car?
- Next week. My man's working on it.

120
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,524
- Works a little slow, don't he?
- No, as a matter of fact, he doesn't.

121
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,602
If you're not interested in buying it,
I'm sure...

122
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,530
...that I can find someone who is.

123
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,291
I didn't mean that, I just meant that...

124
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,762
I figure I could fix it up and turn a profit.

125
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,851
Myrtle Wilson,
this is Nick Carraway. Nick...

126
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,163
Mr and Mrs Wilson.

127
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,688
Why don't you get chairs,
so someone can sit down?

128
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,370
Sure.

129
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,809
I want you to get on the next train.

130
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,726
All right.

131
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,125
I'll meet you in the city.

132
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,522
I really could use that car.
Think I got a buyer for it.

133
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,602
That's fine... Fine.
I'll make sure my man stays right on it.

134
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,923
Nick. Mrs Wilson, nice to see you.

135
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,530
Bye.

136
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,771
Tom!

137
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,930
Hello, Nick.

138
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,170
Stop! Stop here.
I wanna get one of these dogs.

139
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,490
I want one for the apartment.
They're so nice to have.

140
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,962
- What kind are they?
- All kinds.

141
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,487
What kind would you like, lady?

142
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,325
I'd like one of those police dogs.

143
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,765
That's no police dog!

144
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,522
That dog's not exactly a police dog,
he's more of an Airedale.

145
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,083
Look at that coat. Some coat!

146
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,847
That dog will never bother you
with catching a cold.

147
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,323
I think it's cute. How much is it?

148
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,329
That dog?

149
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,723
That dog will cost you $10.

150
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,368
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- That dog?

151
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,367
That dog's a boy.

152
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,563
That dog's a bitch! Here's $10,
go buy ten more dogs with it.

153
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,200
- I'll leave you.
- No, you don't!

154
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,524
Myrtle'd be very hurt if you wouldn't
come up to the apartment.

155
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,686
Come on. I'll call my sister Catherine.
People say she's beautiful.

156
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,044
- What about our appointments?
- Wall Street will be there tomorrow.

157
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,246
Really, Myrtle, that dress!
I think it's adorable!

158
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,406
It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on
when I don't care what I look like.

159
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,484
It looks wonderful on you,
if you know what I mean.

160
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,241
I think if Chester could
get you in that pose...

161
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,683
I think he could
really make something of it.

162
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,925
I'm Catherine, Myrtle's sister.

163
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,243
People say we look like twins,
but I don't think so.

164
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,609
I'm Nick. Won't you sit down?

165
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,971
I told that boy about the ice.

166
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,768
These servants! You really have to
keep after them all the time.

167
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,931
- You live down on Long Island, too?
- Yes, in West Egg.

168
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,645
Really?

169
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,764
I was down at a party in West Egg
about a month ago,

170
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,281
at a man named Gatsby's.

171
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,450
- Do you know him?
- I live next door to him.

172
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,086
He's German.

173
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,650
Really. The cousin or nephew
or something of Kaiser Wilhelm.

174
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,485
That's where all his money comes from.

175
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,883
- Really?
- I'm scared of him.

176
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,569
- Why?
- I'd hate him to get anything on me.

177
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,640
- What a cute dog!
- Darling!

178
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,045
Excuse me, Myrtle,
could you come here?

179
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,329
Neither of them can stand
the person they're married to.

180
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,166
- Can't they?
- Can't stand them!

181
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,686
What I say is,
why go on living with them

182
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,127
if they can't stand them?

183
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,525
Come on! Kiss that adorable little thing!

184
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,810
Myrtle's been living over that garage
for 11 years, you know.

185
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,850
And Tom's the first sweetie
she ever had.

186
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,809
I was on a train to New York,
to see Catherine and spend the night.

187
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,126
Tom was sitting opposite me.

188
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,881
He had on a dress suit
and patent leather shoes.

189
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,929
And I could see
he was a real gentleman.

190
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,889
I couldn't keep my eyes off him.

191
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,805
Every time he looked at me,

192
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,925
I had to pretend to look
at the advertisement above his head.

193
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,565
When we pulled into the station,
he was next to me,

194
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,366
and his white shirt front
was pressed against my arm.

195
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,128
I said, "Well,
I'll have to call a policeman."

196
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,922
But he knew I was lying.

197
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,688
I was so excited. When I got into the taxi

198
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,005
my head was swimming.

199
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,206
I felt as if some very tiny, cold, little fish

200
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,601
was swimming in my veins.

201
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,087
All I kept thinking was, I kept thinking...

202
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,443
You can't live forever!

203
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,722
You can't live forever!

204
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,210
it was the best day of my life.

205
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,045
Myrtle...

206
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,963
What did you do to him?

207
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,122
Big, clumsy...

208
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,802
- What did you do?
- Don't ever call me clumsy!

209
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,284
Myrtle, don't slam the door in my face.

210
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,691
Get out!

211
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,685
Please.

212
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,644
But, you see, it's really his wife
that's keeping them apart.

213
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,163
She's a Catholic,
and they don't believe in divorce.

214
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,287
I have the right
to say her name any time I please.

215
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,091
- Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!
- Shut up.

216
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,602
I can say whatever I want to!
Daisy! Daisy!

217
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,201
Daisy.

218
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,281
Daisy.

219
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,327
- Some chocolate cake, madam.
- Thank you very much.

220
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,927
- Sorry we're late.
- Okay, hurry up.

221
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,447
- Get dressed!
- Be right back.

222
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,481
I'm going to arrange a marriage
between you and Jordan.

223
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,083
I'll sort of fling you together,
lock you up in the linen closet

224
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,807
or push you out to sea in a boat,
all that sort of thing.

225
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,289
I have no money. Would Jordan
marry a man with no money?

226
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,209
Of course not!

227
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,281
On...

228
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,486
Well... It'll just have to be
an affair, then.

229
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,522
We don't know each other very well,
do we? Even if we are cousins.

230
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,530
- You didn't come to my wedding.
- I wasn't back from the war.

231
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,040
- Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick.
- Mummy!

232
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,131
Hello, sweetheart!

233
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,369
Let me tell you what I said
when she was born.

234
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,082
She was less than an hour old
and Tom was...

235
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,367
...God knows where.

236
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,244
I woke up out of the ether
with an utterly abandoned feeling,

237
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,450
and I asked the nurse
if it was a boy or a girl.

238
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,046
She told me it was a girl.

239
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,602
And so I turned away my head and wept.

240
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,369
"All right," I said. "I'm glad it's a girl,
and I hope she'll be a little fool."

241
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,726
That's the best thing
a girl can be in this world,

242
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,882
a beautiful little fool.

243
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,609
Here you are.

244
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,569
- Having a little heart-to-heart with Nick?
- Yes.

245
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,089
I think we talked about the Nordic race.
Yes, I'm sure we did.

246
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,926
It sort of crept up on us,
and first thing we knew...

247
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,885
Don't believe
everything you hear, Nick.

248
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,208
My, my, my!

249
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,927
She is the most immoral young lady
I have ever seen.

250
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,089
- Mr Carraway?
- Yes?

251
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,608
Mr Gatsby would be honoured
if you'd attend his party.

252
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,606
Thank you!

253
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,241
- Hello, Jordan.
- Nick!

254
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,811
I hoped you'd be here.

255
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,167
Your cousin Daisy has a craving for you,
but I'm going to borrow you for tonight.

256
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,927
I never care what I do,
I always have a good time.

257
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,529
When I was here last, I tore my gown
on a chair and he asked my name!

258
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,126
- Who's he?
- Gatsby, of course.

259
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,649
Inside of a week, I got a package
from Croirier with a new gown!

260
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,325
- You keep it?
- Sure.

261
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,121
I was gonna wear it tonight,
but it had to be altered.

262
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,604
It was gas blue
with lavender beads, $265!

263
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,849
There's something funny
about a fellow like that.

264
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,606
He doesn't want
any trouble with anyone.

265
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,842
- Who?
- Gatsby.

266
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,201
Somebody told me...

267
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,847
Somebody told me
they thought he'd killed a man once.

268
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,525
Killed a man?

269
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,971
I heard he was connected with
the government during the war, a spy.

270
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,051
I heard he was in oil, from a man
who grew up with him in Texas.

271
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,965
I knew somebody
he grew up with in St Paul.

272
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,886
Look at him sometime,
when he doesn't know anyone's looking,

273
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,042
you can see it in his eyes.

274
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,931
I bet he did kill a man.

275
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,369
- Which one is he?
- He never really goes to his own parties.

276
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,888
Just looks in to see who's here,
then disappears.

277
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,008
God knows where he is!

278
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,486
- You know I always want pheasant.
- Of course, madam.

279
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,326
Good evening! I'm your entertainer.

280
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,002
I just got married,
to the fattest girl you ever saw.

281
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,007
She was so fat, when she sat on
a drugstore stool, she had a hangover.

282
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,364
She hated to wear dresses,
always skirts. When she walked...

283
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,769
Thank God, it's a fight.

284
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,730
Let's get out.
This is much too polite for me.

285
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,281
Excuse me, sir.

286
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,650
- Would you mind following me?
- I don't understand.

287
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,690
Just follow me, please.

288
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,169
Excuse me.

289
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,768
I was invited.

290
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,401
Mr Gatsby sent a man over
with an invitation.

291
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,081
I live right across over there,
right across the lawn.

292
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,810
Are you sure
you've got the right person?

293
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,841
Yeah.

294
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,930
Excuse me...

295
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,726
How do you do, old sport? I'm Gatsby.

296
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,640
Nick Carraway. It's a pleasure.

297
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,569
You live in the cottage across the lawn.
I tried to buy it once.

298
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,368
- I've been trying to find you, but...
- I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.

299
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,564
Truth of the matter is

300
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,081
I don't much like parties.

301
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,771
I thought we should get acquainted,
since we're neighbours.

302
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,283
- I hope you're enjoying yourself?
- Yes. Thank you.

303
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,051
- If there's anything you want...
- No, everything's fine...

304
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,844
Good.

305
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,450
It's a lovely night for the party.

306
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,281
Yes.

307
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,602
Was there anything else?

308
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,485
No, no...

309
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,522
I just thought perhaps we should meet.

310
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,167
Yes.

311
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,810
Excuse me.

312
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,882
- Shall I...
- No, no...

313
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,525
Yes.

314
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,045
What?

315
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,129
I don't give a damn
what Philadelphia wants.

316
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,722
If that's his idea of a small town,
he's no use to us.

317
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,920
No.

318
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,046
No.

319
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,290
I'm sorry, old sport, it was business.

320
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,961
Yes. Well, I've taken up
too much of your time as it is.

321
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,002
- Any of my guests you'd like to meet?
- No, thank you.

322
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,766
Perhaps we can have lunch?
Tomorrow?

323
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,928
- Fine.
- Good.

324
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,329
See you then.

325
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,760
Grand, isn't it?

326
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,202
What do you think?
Beautiful, isn't it?

327
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,281
Yes.

328
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,971
- Like to drive it?
- I don't think I'd want the responsibility.

329
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,365
Get in.

330
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,007
Look here, what's your
opinion of me, anyhow?

331
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,566
I hadn't really thought about it.

332
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,530
Let me tell you something about my life.

333
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,531
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression from stories.

334
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,085
Why me?

335
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,046
I'm the son of wealthy people
from the Midwest, all dead.

336
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,490
Where in the Midwest?

337
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,248
I was raised in America but educated
at Oxford. It's a family tradition.

338
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,121
My family died,
and I came into a great deal of money.

339
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,531
Then I lived in many European capitals,

340
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,160
trying to forget something sad
that happened long ago.

341
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,003
And then came the war.

342
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,121
I was promoted to Major
after I distinguished myself in battle.

343
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,527
Every Allied government
gave me a decoration,

344
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,366
even little Montenegro,
down on the Adriatic Sea.

345
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,925
Turn it.

346
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,162
"Major Jay Gatsby,
for valour extraordinary."

347
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,090
Why are you telling me this?

348
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,691
You don't make much money, do you?
You sell bonds?

349
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,722
- I try to.
- I run a small business on the side.

350
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,646
I thought you might want to pick up
an extra bit of money.

351
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,200
What kind of business, exactly?

352
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,965
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

353
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,891
This is a nice restaurant
but I like across the street better.

354
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,563
- It's too hot over there.
- And small, but full of memories.

355
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,803
- What place is that?
- The old Metropole.

356
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,568
Filled with faces now dead and gone.
Filled with friends, gone forever.

357
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,043
I'll never forget
when they shot Rosy Rosenthal.

358
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,410
There were six of us.
Rosy had eaten and drunk a lot.

359
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,082
A waiter says,
"Somebody wants to see you outside."

360
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,086
"All right," says Rosy, starts to get up.
I pull him down.

361
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,288
"Let the bastards come in here.

362
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,523
"Don't you make a move
out of this room."

363
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,924
It was 4 a.m. If we'd raised the blinds,
we could've seen daylight.

364
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,289
- Did he go?
- Sure he went!

365
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,444
He said, "Don't let the waiter
take my coffee."

366
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,161
They're on the sidewalk,
shot him three times, drove away.

367
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,881
- Looking for a business connection?
- We'll talk about that later.

368
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,442
This is a friend. We'll talk another time.

369
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,371
I beg your pardon,
I had the wrong man.

370
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,085
Gatsby...

371
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,202
Excuse me, please.

372
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,491
He has to telephone.
Fine fellow, isn't he?

373
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,810
- Handsome, and a perfect gentleman.
- Yes.

374
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,284
He went to Oxford College in England.
You know Oxford College?

375
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,966
Have you known Gatsby a long time?

376
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,361
Known him? I made him.

377
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,163
I made his acquaintance
just after the war.

378
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,642
So poor, he wore his uniform
'cause he couldn't buy clothes.

379
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,004
But I thought,
"That's a man to bring home,

380
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,084
"introduce to your mother
and your sister."

381
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,089
I see you're looking at my cuff button.

382
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,682
Finest specimen of human molars.

383
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,642
- Well, that's a very interesting idea.
- Yes.

384
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,847
Did you... Were you
and Mr Rosenthal close friends?

385
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,249
- Thick like that in everything.
- I'm sorry.

386
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,122
Why? Let us show friendship for a man
when he's alive, not after he's dead.

387
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,527
After that, my own rule
is to let everything alone.

388
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,045
Everything's fine.

389
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,202
- I enjoyed lunch.
- Don't hurry.

390
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,041
You're very polite,
but I belong to another generation.

391
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,603
You sit and discuss your sports
and your young ladies and...

392
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,203
As for me, I'm 60 years old and
I won't impose myself on you any longer.

393
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,724
He becomes very sentimental
sometimes.

394
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,486
What is he, anyway? A dentist?

395
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,248
Meyer Wolfsheim?

396
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,320
No, no... He's a gambler, old sport.

397
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,810
He's the man who fixed
the 1919 World Series.

398
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,167
I never thought a man fixed it.
I imagined it just happened.

399
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,767
- He just saw the opportunity.
- Why isn't he in jail?

400
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,046
They can't get him. He's too smart.

401
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,090
Look, I“.

402
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,563
- Let me get this.
- Nonsense.

403
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,365
Nick! Where have you been?

404
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,926
Daisy's furious you haven't called.

405
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,602
- This is Mr Gatsby. Mr Buchanan.
- How are you?

406
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,441
How does a bond salesman
afford to eat with business types?

407
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,444
I just came down here
to have lunch with Mr Gatsby.

408
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,449
- This is where you hide.
- Jordan!

409
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,246
Listen, I have the most
astonishing thing to tell you!

410
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,242
He wants to know if you'll ask Daisy
to your house and let him come over.

411
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,323
- Who?
- Gatsby.

412
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,849
If that's what he wanted,
why didn't he ask me?

413
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,002
I think he was afraid.

414
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,767
He's waited so long,
he thought you might be offended.

415
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,367
Why me? Why didn't he ask you
to arrange the meeting?

416
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,801
He wants her to see his house.

417
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,969
- You live next door.
- That's ridiculous.

418
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,846
I think he expected her
to wander into one of his parties.

419
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,809
But she never did.

420
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,489
Then he began asking people
if they knew her.

421
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,849
I was the first one he found.

422
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,211
He says he's read the papers for years,
just to catch a glimpse of her name.

423
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,608
I wonder why.

424
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,962
Daisy ought to have
something in her life.

425
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,886
- Does Daisy want to see him?
- She's not to know about it.

426
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,844
You're just supposed to invite her to tea.

427
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,767
But does she want to see Gatsby?

428
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,044
Your cousin will thank you,
thank you, thank you...

429
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,086
Nick!

430
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,281
- Your place looks like the World's Fair.
- I was looking in some of my rooms.

431
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,167
- I spoke to Miss Baker.
- Yes?

432
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,008
I'll call Daisy tomorrow and invite her
for tea. What day would suit you?

433
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,245
What day would suit you?
I don't want to put you to any trouble.

434
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,243
- Come in out of the rain.
- No, I have to go back.

435
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,081
- What do you...
- What about the day after tomorrow?

436
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,771
Well... I have to get the grass cut.

437
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,286
- You mean my grass.
- Right.

438
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,442
They are connected.

439
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,211
- There's that other thing...
- What thing?

440
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,647
Our business relationship.

441
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,122
Any favours that I do for you
don't need any payment.

442
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,201
Well, thank you. Goodnight, Nick.

443
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,850
Nick, my darling!
Where are you calling from, China?

444
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,207
I can barely hear you.

445
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,761
Of course I'll come.

446
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,324
Don't bring Tom?

447
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,970
Tom who?

448
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,200
Yes... Goodbye, my darling.

449
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,211
Thank you.

450
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,846
- Mr Carraway?
- Yes.

451
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,844
Mr Gatsby sent me over
to cut the grass.

452
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,526
Yes, quite all right. Go ahead.

453
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,801
- From Mr Gatsby.
- I know.

454
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,161
- From Mr Gatsby.
- Pass.

455
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,682
- Everything all right?
- The grass looks fine.

456
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,442
What grass? It looks good.
Do you have all you need in the way of...

457
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,921
- Tea.
- Will this do?

458
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,163
Yes, of course.
But I took the liberty of...

459
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,166
I took the liberty of...

460
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,249
I took the liberty
of having some things sent over.

461
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,722
- I'm going home.
- What for?

462
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,764
There's nobody coming. It's too late.

463
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,605
Don't be silly.
It's only five minutes to 4:00.

464
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,049
This is a mistake.

465
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,761
This is a terrible mistake.

466
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,001
Is this absolutely where you live,
my dearest one?

467
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,770
I adore it!

468
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,246
- Are you in love with me?
- Yes.

469
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,646
Is that why I had to come alone?

470
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,483
That is the secret of Castle Rackrent.

471
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,966
It's delicious, Nick!

472
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,641
- And what beautiful flowers!
- That's funny.

473
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,003
White... My favourite colour.

474
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,206
Daisy, I'd like you to meet my
neighbour, Mr Jay Gatsby.

475
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,931
- Mr Gatsby, this is my cousin Daisy...
- We've met...

476
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,284
Before.

477
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,730
We haven't met for many years.

478
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,524
Eight years...

479
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,324
Next November.

480
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,605
Well...

481
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,968
Shall we have some tea?

482
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,323
- it's stopped raining.
- Has it?

483
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,527
- What do you think of that?
- I'm glad, Jay.

484
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,085
- Would you like tea?
- Nick, darling! I feel...

485
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,641
Today's like someone's birthday.
Let's have champagne.

486
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,690
I want you both to come to my house.
I'd like to show her around.

487
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,690
- Sure you want me to come?
- Absolutely.

488
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,081
Nick, I'd just like to wash up.

489
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,886
Look. My house shows up well,
doesn't it?

490
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,049
It's splendid.

491
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,280
It took me three years
to earn the money that bought it.

492
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,768
I thought you said
you inherited your money.

493
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,885
I did, old sport,
but I lost most of it in the big panic.

494
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,128
In the panic of the war.

495
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,326
- What business are you really in?
- That's my affair.

496
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,841
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

497
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,806
I've been in several things.
The drugstore business, then oil.

498
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,008
I'm not in either one now.

499
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,521
- That huge place over there?
- Do you like it?

500
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,207
I love it! But how do you
live there all by yourself?

501
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,285
I keep it full of interesting
people, night and day.

502
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,805
People who do interesting things,

503
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,086
celebrated people.

504
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,884
It's beautiful.

505
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,245
Beautiful.

506
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,968
- Excuse us!
- Quite all right.

507
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,283
Klipspringer was left over
from a party in April.

508
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,601
He was here two weeks
before I knew he'd moved in.

509
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,681
- Did we interrupt your exercises?
- I was asleep, at least I had been...

510
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,209
- Klipspringer plays the piano.
- I hardly play at all...

511
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,489
We'll go upstairs
and he'll play for us. Yes?

512
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,961
Of course I'll play the piano.

513
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,002
- Um, I really am out of practice.
- Don't talk so much. Play!

514
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,410
Jay!

515
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,811
All these clippings about me!

516
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,809
That's a souvenir of my Oxford days.

517
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,207
It was taken in Trinity Quad.

518
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,689
The man on my left
is now the Earl of Doncaster.

519
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,444
Yes?

520
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,247
Well, check with Wolfsheim.

521
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,450
Just do it. I can't talk now.

522
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,803
- Here you are, old sport.
- Thank you.

523
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,923
Come here, quick!

524
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,570
Look at that!

525
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,645
I'd like to get one of those pink clouds
and put you in it and push you around.

526
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,088
I've got a man in London
who buys all my clothes.

527
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,083
He sends over a selection
of things each season.

528
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,888
Spring and fall.

529
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,242
DAISYI

530
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,200
I've never seen
such beautiful shirts before!

531
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,202
- You are a rotten driver!
- We missed it, didn't we?

532
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,161
- Hello, Mr Wilson.
- How are you?

533
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,129
Fill her up, please.

534
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,482
You ought to be more careful,
or not drive at all.

535
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,531
Let other people be careful.
Takes two to make an accident.

536
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,490
Suppose you meet somebody
as careless as you?

537
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,649
I hope I never will.
I hate careless people.

538
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,563
That's why I like you.

539
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,569
40 cents, please.

540
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,529
Thanks very much.

541
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,880
Myrtle?

542
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,286
- Do you remember?
- I do.

543
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,126
When an hour alone with you
was an impossibility.

544
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,965
- My parents!
- No.

545
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,283
Other officers...

546
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,883
Driving up to your great house,
honking, calling out for you.

547
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,807
I remember one on the porch,

548
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,363
waiting in darkness so complete
I couldn't see his face.

549
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,405
They meant nothing.

550
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,648
An hour of your time,
away from the others.

551
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,484
Now you have it, Jay.

552
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,326
All those officers,
what were their names?

553
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,562
You remember their names?

554
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,523
Parts of their names. Not their faces.

555
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,768
Silly young men.

556
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,651
So silly, to let an 18-year-old girl
into their hearts.

557
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,405
Sentimental.

558
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,209
You were never sentimental, Jay.

559
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:41,006
I can't believe it's all here!
Everything that's happened to me.

560
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,528
I collected them.
Your debut after the Armistice,

561
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,242
pictures of you in shining cars,

562
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,482
every ball you attended.

563
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,290
I wore out a hundred pairs of slippers.

564
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,482
Come and sit by me, Jay.

565
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,886
I will.

566
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,725
Why do you stand or sit
as far away from me as possible?

567
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,886
I find it difficult...

568
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,645
To be close to me?

569
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,531
It's been a very long time
since I've been able to look at you.

570
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,446
I wish you had your uniform still.

571
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,650
I would wear the same gown I wore
when you were my favourite beau.

572
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:10,402
We'd dance right here in the great hall
of this preposterous house of yours!

573
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,729
My sweet young Lieutenant Jay Gatsby!

574
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,601
I do still have my uniform.

575
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,567
Then you are a sentimental man.

576
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,361
And Tom? Did you love him?

577
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,281
- Tom who?
- Your husband.

578
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,609
- I know who you mean.
- Why did you marry Tom?

579
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,127
I don't want to talk about Tom!

580
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,449
Or my wedding.

581
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,683
It makes me sad.
And I want to be happy.

582
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,641
- You used to like to make me happy.
- You didn't love him?

583
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,400
It was fine for you, wasn't it?

584
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:53,565
Crowding into my life,
riding in my white car.

585
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,402
Wearing your romantic uniform that hid
who you were, where you came from.

586
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:02,207
Breaking my heart
with your impossible love!

587
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,840
Going off to your adventure...

588
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,402
I told you I'd come back for you,
in my letter.

589
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,650
You said you'd wait.

590
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,043
I'd waited so long!

591
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,448
We were so close

592
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,641
in our month of love.

593
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,082
Why did you marry him?

594
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,089
Mr Tom Buchanan, son of
Mr Torn Buchanan of Chicago, Illinois,

595
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,241
blew into my life with more

596
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,967
pomp and circumstance
than Louisville ever knew before.

597
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:57,404
He came down with a hundred people
in four private rail road cars.

598
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,445
He hired a whole floor
of the Muhlbach Hotel, he just

599
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,442
blinded me with excitement.

600
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,241
He gave you a string of pearls.

601
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,561
Valued at $350,000.

602
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,723
Jordan Baker told you that, didn't she?

603
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,370
Traitor!

604
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,566
Well, what else did she tell you?

605
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,490
Did she tell you
how she found me that night?

606
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,564
Lying in my room, drunk as a monkey,

607
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,008
with a bottle of Sauternes
in one hand and...

608
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,128
My letter in the other.

609
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,801
"I never had a drink before," I said,
"but, how I do enjoy it."

610
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,166
I pulled the $350,000 string of pearls
out of the waste-paper basket and said,

611
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:55,804
"Here, dearest, you take them back
to whoever from Chicago they belong to,

612
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,851
"and tell him, tell them all,
that Daisy's changed her mind."

613
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,283
Daisy's changed her mind!

614
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,684
Next day you married Tom Buchanan,
without so much as a shiver.

615
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,207
You know what Jordan did?

616
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,371
She ran a cold tub
and dropped me into it, dress and all.

617
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,570
And I couldn't stop crying
but I wouldn't let go of your letter.

618
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,485
I hung onto it and hung onto it.

619
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,921
Until it came to pieces in the water...

620
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,921
Melted away like snow.

621
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,890
Why? Why didn't you wait for me?

622
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,645
Because“.

623
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,884
Rich girls don't marry poor boys,
Jay Gatsby.

624
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,164
Haven't you heard?

625
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,405
Rich girls don't marry poor boys!

626
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,248
Well, I see the Chester Beckers
are here.

627
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,764
And the Leeches.

628
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,763
There's that man Bunsen.
I knew him at Yale.

629
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,922
How are you?

630
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,088
Despised him.

631
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,443
The Hornbeams, Willie Voltaire.
How are you?

632
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,284
Nice to see you.

633
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,610
Thank you.

634
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,762
Good God, look!
A clan of Blackbucks in the corner.

635
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,323
- Flipping their noses up.
- Practically all of East Egg here.

636
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,528
- Hello.
- Lsmays, how are you?

637
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,604
Mr Chrystie, sir, how are you?
Nice to see you.

638
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,685
My wife, Daisy. Jordan Baker.
Mr and Mrs Chrystie.

639
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,481
Hammerheads, too.

640
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,645
- Look, Beluga, the tobacco importer.
- And Beluga's girls.

641
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,446
This is mixed company.

642
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,843
West Eggers. I recognise some of them.

643
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,604
Mrs Pole...

644
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:00,243
And Mr and Mrs Mulready
right behind her.

645
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,363
Look, darling, over there.
Cecil Roebuck.

646
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:11,044
Cecil Schoen, right there. This is Gulick
in the blue suit, the State Senator.

647
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,847
That's G Earl Muldoon,
whose brother strangled his wife.

648
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:20,001
There's James B "Rot-Gut" Ferret.
Look here, young Nick Carraway!

649
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,323
- Been seeing a lot of Gatsby lately.
- Nick!

650
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,249
- How are you, Nick?
- Fine.

651
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,888
- Nice to see you.
- Daisy, you look lovely.

652
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,209
- You too, Jordan.
- And me?

653
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,570
- I'm running away to Africa with Nick.
- Very nice.

654
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:44,727
These things excite me so! If you
want to kiss me, I'll arrange it for you.

655
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,123
Just mention my name.
Or present a green card...

656
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,164
Jay Gatsby. I'm so happy to see you.

657
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:03,250
- I believe we've met before.
- Absolutely right. I remember it well.

658
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,562
About three weeks ago.

659
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,880
Absolutely right. You were with Nick.

660
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,924
You must see many people
you know here.

661
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,970
- Yes.
- Actually, we don't know a soul here.

662
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,210
- Senator Evans. Mrs Buchanan.
- How do you do?

663
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,921
- And Mr Buchanan, the polo player.
- How do you do?

664
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:26,163
- Colonel.
- I've never seen so many celebrities!

665
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,527
I like that man,

666
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,045
with the sort of blue nose.

667
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,924
- He's a rather small producer.
- Well, I like him anyhow.

668
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,090
I'd rather not be "the polo player".

669
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:43,006
He'd rather look at all those
famous people incognito.

670
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,805
They're in some new Broadway show.

671
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,928
Go ahead. If you want to write down
any addresses, here's my pencil.

672
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,482
- Daisy!
- It's all right. You have my permission.

673
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,722
Jordan will chaperone.

674
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,328
You'll keep watch, won't you?
For a fire or a flood or an act of God?

675
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,164
Kiss me.

676
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,210
Hiya, Buchanan.

677
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:31,331
Sharks in my hair!
There are sharks in my hair!

678
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,571
- Have you seen Daisy?
- No, I haven't.

679
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,681
- But Jordan told me she was with you.
- She was with Gatsby and some people.

680
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,485
Tell me, who is this Gatsby fellow?
Some big bootlegger?

681
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:09,167
- I heard he was a relative of the Kaiser.
- Nick...

682
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,886
I figure he's just a bootlegger.

683
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,482
A lot of these newly rich people
are just bootleggers.

684
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,847
- Not Gatsby.
- No...

685
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,641
He must have strained himself
to get this lot together.

686
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,009
- At least they're interesting.
- Where have you been?

687
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,170
- Up dancing.
- I don't have to ask who with, do I?

688
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,962
- It wasn't Beluga, the tobacco importer.
- Give it to me.

689
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,290
Where is he now?

690
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,408
Without a shirt,
without a shirt.

691
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,643
- Who, Beluga?
- No, not Beluga. Gatsby.

692
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,129
- He had a phone call.
- Really?

693
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:54,404
I want to know who he is
and what he does. Get in the car, now.

694
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,522
- Now.
- Now, Daisy.

695
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:01,766
I can tell you what he does.
He owns a lot of drugstores.

696
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:04,884
- He built them up himself.
- Get in the car.

697
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,041
Without a shirt...

698
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,009
Daisy! Get in!

699
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,650
Goodnight, Nick.

700
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,370
Without a shirt, goodnight.

701
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,966
See you, Nick. Get in the car.

702
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,641
Without a shirt, without a shirt

703
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,041
Thank you for staying, Nick.

704
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,570
- She didn't like it.
- Of course she did.

705
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,767
She didn't have a good time.

706
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:33,801
I'll fix everything...
Just the way it was before. She'll see.

707
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,207
You can't repeat the past.

708
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,728
Can't repeat the past?

709
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,128
Of course you can!

710
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,771
Find out where his
money comes from.

711
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,527
What clubs he belongs to.

712
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,411
Who his parents are
and where they live.

713
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,609
And his women.

714
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,686
I want to know about his women.

715
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,563
- Put on your uniform.
- That's foolish.

716
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,883
Good! Let's be foolish.

717
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:31,410
Put on your uniform and we'll turn out
all the lights except for a single candle.

718
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,325
And I'll let you tell me you love me.

719
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,210
Do you remember that night?

720
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,327
That still October night.

721
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,480
I've felt married
to you ever since.

722
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,647
I knew that if I could kiss you...

723
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,687
If I could kiss you...

724
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,683
I love you, Jay.

725
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:12,083
Did you know that I bought this house
just to be across the bay from you?

726
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,685
Don't say that. I'll start to cry again.

727
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,764
Jay!

728
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,210
It's the colour of the light on your dock.

729
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,323
But... You know I can't wear it.

730
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,282
You wear it for me.

731
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,930
- I'll love you forever.
- Kiss me.

732
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,929
Be my lover.

733
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,164
- Stay my lover.
- I'll be your husband.

734
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,128
Husband and lover.

735
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,603
Hi... I'm from the New York Journal.

736
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,127
Wanted to ask you some questions
about your neighbour.

737
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,530
- Mr Gatsby?
- What sort of questions?

738
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:24,447
I was just wondering if you've
seen anything interesting going on?

739
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,166
No.

740
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:31,040
I've been hearing his name a lot
the last couple of weeks.

741
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:35,205
Seems he and Meyer Wolfsheim...
You know that name?

742
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,641
Got something big cooking.

743
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,883
- I don't know what you mean.
- This is unofficial. It's my day off.

744
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,408
I like to come out here sometimes
on my day off.

745
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,241
If you want to know something,
why not ask Mr Gatsby?

746
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,726
When curiosity about Gatsby
was at its highest,

747
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:15,646
the lights in his house failed to go on,
one Saturday night.

748
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,366
Are you closing your place down?

749
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,685
No.

750
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,845
I hear you fired all your servants.

751
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:57,284
Daisy comes over quite often
in the afternoon. I don't want gossip.

752
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,968
You seem to attract it.

753
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,042
They say you killed a man.

754
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,404
Just one?

755
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,931
And you?

756
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,448
- Have you ever loved anybody else?
- No.

757
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,243
Of course, you could
never love anybody but me.

758
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,761
I love the way you love me.

759
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:30,042
I don't want you to go home to him
any more. I want to tell him.

760
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,524
We'll tell him.

761
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,085
I promise.

762
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,484
We'll tell him.

763
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,405
Soon.

764
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,564
I read somewhere that it's...

765
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,246
The sun's getting hotter every year.

766
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:59,041
Seems that the earth
is going to fall onto the sun.

767
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,610
Actually, it's just the opposite of that.

768
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,570
The sun is getting colder every year.

769
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:12,607
Excuse me, sir.
Mr Davis Goff is on the telephone.

770
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,205
Excuse me.

771
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,408
You know I love you.

772
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,602
You forget there's a lady present.

773
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:46,010
- You kiss Nick, too.
- What a low, vulgar girl.

774
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,564
I don't care.

775
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,210
Mummy!

776
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,002
Blessed precious!

777
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,811
Come to your own mother
that loves you!

778
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,490
Now... Say, "How d'you do?"

779
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,050
How do you do?

780
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,050
Say, "How d'you do?"

781
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,170
How do you do?

782
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:28,167
You dream! You absolute little dream!

783
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,766
Yes. Aunt Jordan's
got a blue dress, too.

784
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:39,482
How do you like Mother's friends?
Do you think they're pretty?

785
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,688
Where's Daddy?

786
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:46,042
She doesn't look like her father,
she looks like me.

787
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,761
She's got my hair
and the shape of the face.

788
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,488
Come, Pammy.

789
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,883
- Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Goodbye, Mummy.

790
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,721
- Daddy!
- How's Daddy's little girl?

791
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,167
I met all Mummy's friends.

792
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:19,450
That's my good girl.
You run along and I'll see you later.

793
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,611
Well...

794
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,563
What'll we do with ourselves
this afternoon?

795
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:41,649
And the day after that?
And the next 30 years?

796
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,602
Don't be morbid! Life starts again
when things get crisp in the fall.

797
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,446
But it's so hot!
And everything's so confused!

798
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,365
- Let's all go to town.
- That's an idea.

799
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,042
You look so cool!

800
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,643
You always look so cool.

801
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,810
I mean, you resemble
the advertisement of the man...

802
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,604
All right.

803
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,522
I'm perfectly willing to go to town.

804
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,442
Why don't we all go to town?

805
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,444
Come on. If we're going, let's start.

806
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:30,486
Let's have some fun! It's too hot to fuss.

807
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,325
I don't get the idea of going to town.

808
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,845
Women...

809
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:05,368
- Get these notions in their heads.
- Shall we take anything to drink?

810
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,122
I'll get some whisky.

811
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,409
I can't say anything
inside his house, old sport.

812
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,207
She's got an indiscreet voice.

813
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,045
- It's full of...
- It's full of...

814
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,527
Her voice is full of money.

815
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,051
Jay Gatsby!

816
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,681
- Shall we take my car?
- Is it a standard shift?

817
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,250
Yes.

818
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:13,246
Then why don't you let me take your car,
and you take mine?

819
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:16,324
- There's not much gas.
- There's plenty.

820
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:21,890
If we run out we can stop at a drugstore.
You can buy anything in a drugstore.

821
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:24,930
Daisy, ride with me in the circus wagon.

822
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:28,926
No, you take Nick and Jordan.
We'll follow.

823
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:35,450
- Did you see that?
- Did I see what?

824
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,649
I've investigated this fellow, you know.

825
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,282
- And found he was an Oxford man.
- Oxford like hell!

826
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:47,162
- He wears a goddamn pink suit.
- Nevertheless, he is an Oxford man.

827
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,163
Oxford, New Mexico!

828
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,044
Or something like that.

829
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,049
Well? Let's have some gas!

830
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,811
I'm sick... I've been sick all day.

831
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,281
Do I have to help myself?

832
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,970
I'm sorry.

833
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:11,209
Mr Buchanan, I was wondering
when you'd let me have your blue car.

834
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,447
How do you like this one?
I bought it last week.

835
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,046
- It's a nice yellow one.
- Like to buy it, would you?

836
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:26,525
Big chance!
No, but I could use the other.

837
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,480
I need money pretty bad right now.

838
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,730
- My wife and I want to go West.
- Your wife wants to go?

839
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,921
I just got wised up to something funny
the last few days.

840
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,606
That's why I need the...
That's why I want to go away.

841
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,641
That's why I bother you about the car.

842
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,604
That's enough gas.
How much do I owe you?

843
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,325
$1.20.

844
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:11,084
I'll let you have that car.
I'll send it around tomorrow afternoon.

845
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,646
I love New York on summer afternoons
when everyone's away.

846
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,121
There's something sensuous about it,

847
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:09,727
a little ripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits
are going to fall into your hands.

848
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,809
- Where are we going?
- How about the movies?

849
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,681
It's too hot! You go,
we'll drive around and meet you after.

850
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:22,401
We'll meet you on some corner.
I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.

851
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:28,249
We can't argue about it here,
so you follow me to the Plaza Hotel.

852
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:32,007
We can order five bathrooms
and take cold baths!

853
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:49,610
Me!

854
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,688
Open another window!

855
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,845
- There aren't any more.
- Then we'd better phone for an axe!

856
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,209
The thing to do
is to forget about the heat.

857
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,045
You make it worse by crabbing about it.

858
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:10,046
Why not let her alone, old sport?
You wanted to come to town.

859
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,730
- That's a great expression of yours.
- What is?

860
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:19,202
That "old sport" business.
Where'd you get that?

861
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:23,251
Tom, if you make personal remarks,
I won't stay here a minute.

862
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,811
Imagine marrying anyone in this heat.

863
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,042
I was married in June.

864
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:36,771
Mr Gatsby, I understand
that you're an Oxford man.

865
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:42,405
- Not exactly.
- No, no...

866
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,650
- I understood that you went to Oxford.
- I went there, yes.

867
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:58,484
It was an opportunity
they gave officers after the Armistice.

868
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,762
Were you in the war?

869
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,800
No, I wasn't in the war.

870
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:13,081
I want to know what kind of row
you're trying to cause.

871
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:18,610
He isn't causing a row, you are!
Please, have a little self-control.

872
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,885
Self-control?

873
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:24,451
Have a little self-control?

874
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:28,446
I suppose the latest thing
is to sit back and relax,

875
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:33,242
while Mr Nobody from Nowhere
makes love to your wife, is that it?

876
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:36,370
Well, if that is it, Daisy, count me out.

877
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:40,081
Because let me make myself clear.

878
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:44,808
People begin by sneering at family life,
and family institutions,

879
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,042
and before you know it,

880
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:50,443
we'll have intermarriage
between black and white!

881
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:54,047
- We're all white here.
- I've got something to tell you.

882
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,202
- Please, don't!
- Listen...

883
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,324
- Please, let's all go home.
- No, no!

884
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:02,484
- Let's all go home.
- Nobody's going home.

885
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,126
I'm going to sit down right here,

886
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:09,851
and I'll listen to what it is
that Mr Gatsby has to tell me.

887
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:13,086
Yes.

888
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,450
- Thank you.
- Sir.

889
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:29,685
Well?

890
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,211
Your wife doesn't love you.
She's never loved you. She loves me.

891
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:44,082
- You're crazy.
- She married you because I was poor.

892
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:47,124
She was tired of waiting,
it was a mistake.

893
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:51,683
- She's never loved anyone except me.
- That's a goddamn lie.

894
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:56,687
Daisy loved me when she married me.
She loves me now and I love her now.

895
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:02,728
I'll admit she gets confused and involved
in things she doesn't understand.

896
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:07,204
I also have been known to go on a spree
and make a fool of myself.

897
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:12,366
But I have always come back.
And in my heart, I always love her!

898
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,642
You are revolting!

899
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:18,849
Do you remember why
we left Chicago?

900
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,322
Why don't you tell the story
of that little spree?

901
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:26,565
Just tell him the truth. Just tell him!

902
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,929
Tell him you never loved him
and it will all be wiped out. Forever!

903
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:41,202
How could I love him possibly? I...

904
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:46,408
- You never loved him.
- I never loved him.

905
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,767
- Not on our honeymoon?
- No!

906
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:56,009
And not that day that I picked you up
in my arms and I carried you

907
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,448
all the way down
from the Punch Bowl,

908
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,285
so your little feet wouldn't get wet?

909
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,089
Open a window!

910
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,725
Daisy...

911
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,611
- Daisy, I love you.
- Please, don't.

912
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,281
You want too much!

913
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:25,444
I love you now, isn't that enough?
I can't help what's past.

914
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,363
I did love him once, but I loved you, too.

915
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,129
Loved me, too?

916
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:39,489
There are things between Daisy
and me you'll never know.

917
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,051
Things that neither one of us
can ever forget.

918
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:46,769
I'm going to take better care of you now.

919
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:50,244
You're not taking care of her any more.

920
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,603
- I'm not? Why's that?
- Daisy's leaving you.

921
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,802
I am, though.

922
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,720
No...

923
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,802
She's not leaving me.

924
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,562
Certainly not for a swindler who'd
have to steal a ring to put on her finger.

925
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,570
No!

926
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,531
- Leave me alone!
- Daisy!

927
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,730
And I know what your drugstores are!

928
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:41,250
He and Meyer Wolfsheim
bought up drugstores,

929
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,801
to sell alcohol over the counter.

930
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,843
But they're just small change.

931
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,369
He's got something new with Wolfsheim
that everyone's afraid to talk about.

932
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,050
Well, he's lost her now.

933
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,723
Want any of this stuff?

934
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,845
Nick?

935
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,170
Jordan?

936
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:20,889
- Nick?
- What?

937
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:23,245
Want any?

938
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:27,051
No.

939
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:34,163
This presumptuous
little flirtation is over.

940
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,242
I just realised...

941
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,251
He doesn't know her
like I know her.

942
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:44,602
Today is my birthday.

943
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,091
I'm 30.

944
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:55,571
- Gimme that key!
- Stay here until we go West.

945
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,610
- Like you wanted.
- I never wanted to go with you!

946
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:01,366
You was crazy about going West.

947
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,763
The only crazy I was
was when I married you!

948
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,807
You did marry me, Myrtle.

949
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:17,285
I thought you were a gentleman.
I found out you aren't fit to lick my shoe!

950
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:23,528
You didn't even have your own suit to
get married in, and you never told me!

951
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:30,440
I couldn't help it because
I couldn't afford to buy a suit.

952
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:35,330
What you're trying to do
is not right, Myrtle.

953
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:39,610
I'm a trusting kind of fellow.
I don't think no harm to nobody.

954
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:43,011
But when I know a thing, I know it.

955
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,004
Maybe you think you can fool me, Myrtle.

956
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,684
Maybe you can.

957
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:13,289
But you can't fool God.
God sees everything.

958
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,808
That's an advertisement.

959
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:28,002
You're so dumb,
you don't know you're alive.

960
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:37,960
I'm not so dumb I don't know
what's right from what's wrong.

961
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,211
Myrtle!

962
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,402
Are you all right?

963
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:55,562
Get away from me!

964
01:47:58,240 --> 01:47:59,571
No!

965
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,451
Wreck.

966
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,324
That's good.

967
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,282
Wilson'll finally have
some business at last.

968
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,006
We'll just pull in and have a look.

969
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:27,410
Just a look.

970
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,090
- M-A-V-O...
- No, R. Mavro.

971
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:00,050
- R-O...
- Could you listen to me?

972
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,771
- What do you want?
- What happened?

973
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:05,366
An auto hit her. Instantly killed.

974
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:10,050
She ran into the road. Swine didn't stop.

975
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,602
There were two cars.
One coming, one going, see?

976
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,491
- Going where?
- One going each way.

977
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,802
God!

978
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:25,769
It was a big yellow car.

979
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,209
A big yellow car. New.

980
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,368
- You see the accident?
- Yeah...

981
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,130
- Hold it...
- No.

982
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:38,644
The car passed down the road,
going faster than 40. Going 50, 60.

983
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,243
- Going through here fast.
- Which way did it go?

984
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,323
God.

985
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:13,281
Come on, let's get out of here.

986
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:18,087
Her left breast was torn off.

987
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,003
Son of a bitch!

988
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,201
He didn't even stop his car.

989
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,123
You know that?

990
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,330
Daisy's home.

991
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:25,444
Nick, why not come in
and have something to eat,

992
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,570
and then you can take the car on home.

993
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:32,930
There's nothing more we can do tonight.

994
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,366
- Won't you come in, Nick?
- No.

995
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,125
Nick...

996
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,931
- Goodnight, Nick.
- 'Night.

997
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:09,482
What are you doing?

998
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,688
Just standing here.

999
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,007
- Did you see any trouble on the road?
- Yes.

1000
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:21,321
- Was she killed?
- Yes.

1001
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,925
I thought so.

1002
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,844
I told Daisy I thought so.

1003
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:35,120
- Why didn't you stop?
- It was a terrible shock for Daisy.

1004
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:39,561
Daisy... Christ!

1005
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:43,930
I just want to wait here and make sure
he doesn't try to bother her.

1006
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,209
He won't touch her.
He's not thinking about her.

1007
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:52,601
I don't trust him, old sport.

1008
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,406
I'll wait all night if necessary.

1009
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:35,440
Maybe you got some friend
I could telephone for, George?

1010
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,562
I knew there was something.

1011
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,125
You got a church you go to sometimes?

1012
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:48,166
I knew it when she came back
with her nose all bust and bleeding.

1013
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:52,882
Maybe I could call up the church
and get a priest to come over...

1014
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:55,771
...to talk to you, see?

1015
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,160
I don't belong to any.

1016
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:02,761
You ought to have a church, George,
for times like this.

1017
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:12,290
You must have gone to church once.
Didn't you get married in a church?

1018
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,648
Long time ago.

1019
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,928
Look in that drawer there.

1020
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:56,609
She had it wrapped up in tissue paper.

1021
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:00,451
In a place where she hides things.

1022
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:08,168
We ain't got a dog.

1023
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,922
She ain't got a dog.

1024
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:18,408
She's got a dog leash
with diamonds on it.

1025
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,445
My God!

1026
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,764
Then he killed her.

1027
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,841
Who killed her, George?

1028
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:46,890
- He murdered her.
- It was an accident.

1029
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,162
It was the man in the car.

1030
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:03,161
She said he was coming for her.

1031
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,249
Then he didn't stop.

1032
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:20,564
Maybe I ought to call up the church.

1033
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:23,291
Which church should I call, George?

1034
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:30,409
I'll go find out some names
of churches, George.

1035
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:41,766
I told her... God sees everything.

1036
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,566
I'll read some names of churches.

1037
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:21,601
I didn't mean it... I didn't mean it.

1038
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,328
I warned her.

1039
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:28,885
I'm sorry.

1040
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,289
I'll fix it right.

1041
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,129
All right? I'll make it right.

1042
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:41,330
I'll do it.

1043
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,370
I'll do it.

1044
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:49,164
I'll do it...

1045
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:44,811
Nick.

1046
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,009
Nothing happened.

1047
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:52,202
I waited till about 4:00.
She came to the window.

1048
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:56,568
She stood a minute
and then turned out the light.

1049
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,402
Have you got a cigarette?

1050
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:14,570
Just one.

1051
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,570
We'll share it.

1052
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:52,007
Imagine what this island looked
like when those Dutch sailors first saw it.

1053
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:57,083
Fresh green...

1054
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,965
Like a dream of a new world.

1055
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:07,203
They must have held their breath,

1056
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:11,251
afraid it would disappear
before they could touch it.

1057
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:23,962
You didn't see that woman.

1058
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,810
She was ripped open, and you drove off!

1059
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:33,807
All I can see is Daisy.
All I can think about is Daisy.

1060
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:38,010
She was so frightened,
I tried to grab for the wheel but she...

1061
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,009
It was Daisy?

1062
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:43,366
Daisy was driving.

1063
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:47,007
She was very nervous
when we left New York.

1064
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:52,003
She thought it would help
steady her to drive.

1065
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:57,169
This woman rushed out.
It happened in a second.

1066
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:59,084
It seems she recognised the car.

1067
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:05,169
It seemed like she wanted
to speak to us.

1068
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:10,969
Thought we were somebody she knew.
Daisy's never really needed me before.

1069
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,520
I don't think
she ever loved him.

1070
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:57,086
That house of hers in Louisville...

1071
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:02,123
It was the most beautiful house
I'd ever seen.

1072
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:06,370
All that crystal

1073
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:10,605
and silver.

1074
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:17,482
It was full of a kind of...

1075
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:23,485
It was...

1076
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:26,761
It...

1077
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:31,731
You must remember, old sport,
that she was very excited.

1078
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:34,565
He tried to make me look like a sharper.

1079
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:37,451
She didn't know what she was saying.

1080
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:48,411
Of course, she might have loved him.

1081
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:51,689
For a minute,
when they were first married.

1082
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:57,850
But loved me more even then, you see?

1083
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:06,931
In any case, it was just personal.

1084
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:18,920
You ought to go away a while,
to Montreal or someplace safe.

1085
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:22,806
- Go away? Now?
- Just till it all blows over.

1086
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:27,488
I can't leave! She'll be coming
just as soon as she can get away.

1087
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:30,890
I suppose so.

1088
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,771
You stay right there. I'll handle this.

1089
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:11,241
Who is that man? Do you know?

1090
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:15,081
That's Mr Wilson, ma'am.
From the garage up by the big sign.

1091
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:35,688
Pammy, you must
wear that dress.

1092
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:36,761
I won't!

1093
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,646
Do as you're told.
If you don't, I'll tell your mother.

1094
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:43,451
- Mummy!
- Be a good girl.

1095
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:47,246
Mummy, I don't want to wear this dress.
I hate this colour!

1096
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:54,285
Hush, blessed precious, don't cry!

1097
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:56,283
Don't cry!

1098
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:00,326
Beautiful little fools can wear
whatever colour they like.

1099
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,649
Summer's almost over.

1100
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:17,850
Sad, isn't it?

1101
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,968
Makes you want to...

1102
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:27,130
I don't know... Reach out and...

1103
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:29,203
Hold it back.

1104
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:33,282
There'll be other summers.

1105
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,362
How about a swim?

1106
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:43,969
Maybe later?

1107
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:51,164
- I'll call you around noon.
- Fine, old sport. I'll be at the pool.

1108
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:57,371
Nick...

1109
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:01,205
Thank you.

1110
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:12,361
They're a rotten crowd.

1111
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:15,370
You're worth the whole
damn bunch put together.

1112
02:08:57,240 --> 02:09:00,164
I love you, Jay.
You know I love you-

1113
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:04,845
Daisy?

1114
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:11,085
Daisy?

1115
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:28,487
I'll remember the rest of that day
as an endless drill

1116
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:31,171
of police and photographers
and newspapermen,

1117
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:33,607
in and out of Gatsby's house.

1118
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:39,761
A rope across the main gate, and
a policeman by it, kept out the curious.

1119
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:43,402
But little boys discovered
they could enter by my yard.

1120
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:47,485
There were always a few of them,
open-mouthed, about the pool.

1121
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,371
Mrs Buchanan, please.

1122
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:54,451
- We need instructions from someone.
- Can't find any next of kin.

1123
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:58,491
- There's a very strict ordinance.
- When do you expect her?

1124
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:02,480
- If there's no instructions...
- I'll give the instructions.

1125
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:04,091
- Who's this?
- He's the neighbour.

1126
02:12:04,160 --> 02:12:05,207
Any idea how I can reach them?

1127
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,611
- What neighbour?
- Next door.

1128
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:07,841
I can't say.

1129
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:08,967
I was his friend.

1130
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,041
The Buchanans
left this afternoon.

1131
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:13,965
Thank you.

1132
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:27,728
All I could think of
was his extraordinary gift for hope.

1133
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:34,287
A romantic readiness such as I have
never found in any other person,

1134
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:37,922
and which it is not likely
I shall ever find again.

1135
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:42,444
The following day, I phoned Wolfsheim.

1136
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:48,888
I was sure he would come
to the funeral, but all he said was,

1137
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:53,841
"Let us show friendship for a man
when he's alive, not after he's dead.

1138
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:58,168
"After that, my rule
is to let everything alone."

1139
02:12:58,360 --> 02:13:00,966
I remembered him saying that before.

1140
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:12,166
But I was waiting for a letter
or a phone call from Daisy.

1141
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:36,562
Is this...

1142
02:13:37,640 --> 02:13:39,881
Is this

1143
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:42,321
my son's house?

1144
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:03,050
I saw it in the Chicago newspapers.

1145
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:06,124
He was in all the Chicago newspapers.

1146
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:08,681
I didn't know how to reach you,
Mr Gatsby.

1147
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,289
Of course...

1148
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,926
We was broke up

1149
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:18,801
when he went from home.

1150
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:24,725
But I see now there was a reason for it.

1151
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:33,050
He knew he had a big future
in front of him.

1152
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,685
Ever since he made his success

1153
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:49,481
he was very generous to me.

1154
02:14:58,680 --> 02:15:00,967
He was only a young man.

1155
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:06,523
But he had a lot of brain power. Here.

1156
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:13,885
If he'd lived...

1157
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:20,008
He'd have helped build up the country.

1158
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,405
Yes, that's true.

1159
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,204
I just...

1160
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:30,726
It just shows you, all this.

1161
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:34,405
It just shows you.

1162
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:40,202
Who is this girl?

1163
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:51,570
I didn't know what you'd want,
Mr Gatsby.

1164
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:55,171
- Gatz is my name.
- Mr Gatz.

1165
02:15:56,880 --> 02:16:00,327
I thought you might want
to take the body West.

1166
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:05,131
Jimmy always liked it better down East.

1167
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:09,683
He rose to his position in the East.

1168
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:13,766
He had a lot of friends here.

1169
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:17,771
Are you one of his friends, Mr...

1170
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:20,922
We were close friends.

1171
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:29,921
I found this.

1172
02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:39,086
It's a book he had. When he was a boy.

1173
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:43,962
It just shows you.

1174
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:49,922
"Schedule of Resolves:

1175
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:53,370
"One...

1176
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:56,962

1177
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:01,606
"poise, and how to attain it.

1178
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:05,325
"Two...

02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:07,960

02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:14,163
"inventions.

02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:17,649
"Three...

1182
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:23,442
"Save five dollars. " He crossed that out,
said three dollars...

1183
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:25,523
. . per week.

1184
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:30,649
No more smoking or chewing.

1185
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:37,491
Be better to parents."

1186
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,686
...one God,
world without end. Amen.

1187
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:54,002
She didn't send flowers,
no message, nothing.

1188
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:57,283
- How could she?
- She could, if she'd wanted.

1189
02:17:58,040 --> 02:18:01,044
They're careless people,
Tom and Daisy.

1190
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:04,363
They smash things up
and retreat into their money,

1191
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:08,809
or vast carelessness, or whatever it is
that keeps them together,

1192
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:11,566
leaving other people
to clean up the mess.

1193
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:14,441
I had lunch with them today.

1194
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:16,801
They're going to Europe for a few weeks

1195
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:19,645
while their new house
is being prepared.

1196
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:24,087
I'm going away too,
only I'm going back West.

1197
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:29,250
- I'm too squeamish for the East.
- Is that why you threw me over?

1198
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:33,324
Something about bad drivers?

1199
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:37,247
And taking two to make an accident.

1200
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:50,246
Nick, how are you? Nice to see you.

1201
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:54,166
Aren't you going to shake my hand?

1202
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,487
What's the matter with him?

1203
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:01,649
- What did you tell Wilson, Tom?
- Wilson?

1204
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:03,846
I told him the truth.

1205
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:09,365
If I hadn't told him who owned the car,
he would've killed me.

1206
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:10,931
Nick...

1207
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:14,167
Gatsby had it coming to him.

1208
02:19:14,360 --> 02:19:16,601
He ran over Myrtle
like you'd run over a dog

1209
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:18,927
and never bothered to stop his car.

1210
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:22,800
Nick...

1211
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:28,129
I've had my share of suffering, too,
you know.

1212
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:30,601
I went back to Myrtle's flat

1213
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:35,122
and I looked at that
little box of dog biscuits.

1214
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:38,691
And I sat down and cried like a baby.

1215
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:43,805
Tom... Don't you realise...

1216
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:47,646
Nick!

1217
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:50,121
How lovely to see you!

1218
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:54,485
I've been meaning
to call you for days,

1219
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:57,968
but I've been so busy with the house,
you can't imagine.

1220
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:01,403
You have to come and see us
as soon as we get back.

1221
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:04,689
You'll be our first guest. Promise.

1222
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:07,280
We've got to go. Nick, Jordan.

1223
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:10,330
You know how I love
to see you at my table.

1224
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:12,005
Daisy!

1225
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:38,369
I thought of Gatsby's wonder
when he first saw

1226
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:42,002
the green light
at the end of Daisy's dock.

1227
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:44,931
He had come a long way to this lawn.

1228
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:50,041
His dream must have seemed so close
that he could hardly fail to grasp it.

1229
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:56,886
He did not know
that it was already behind him.
