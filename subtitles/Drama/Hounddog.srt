1
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:29,008
We have to stop or we'll
chase of these snakes...

2
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:37,631
Hounddog

3
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,518
Follow me.

4
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:09,053
I told you.

5
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,871
Let me see.

6
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,885
you said I'd get a kiss..

7
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:16,585
No,You gotta show me first.

8
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:19,043
Charlie said you gave him a kiss for nothing

9
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:21,900
Charlie is a liar,
he showed me his thing,he did.

10
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,687
I want my first kiss first.

11
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,501
No! You gotta show me first.

12
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,316
Maybe you won't give me my kiss then.

13
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,484
Sure, I will ,come on,now show.

14
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:46,545
Stupid, you got to take 'em all the way off.

15
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,807
No, I won't.

16
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:49,547
Then I won't
kiss you.

17
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,443
Okay.

18
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:00,775
There.

19
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,388
What's that from?

20
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:04,396
What?

21
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:06,987
- That big old bruise you got there.
- Nothing.

22
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:08,747
- I got one.
- Where?

23
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:09,957
Right Here.

24
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:12,886
- My daddy did it.
- My daddy dont hit me.

25
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:15,109
Does so.
Does not, liar.

26
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:18,890
I'm going to kill my daddy one day.
Are not..

27
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,590
Am too. And I'll kill your daddy too, if you want.

28
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:23,220
No, I don't want.

29
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,264
- Where are you going?
- Home.

30
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:28,380
but about your kiss?
I don't want.

31
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:32,103
But I want to. I want to kiss you.

32
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,593
Okay.

33
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,732
Who are you?

34
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:38,791
Now you stay out.

35
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:42,574
Where's my daddy?

36
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,526
He's in the can, he'll be out in a minute.

37
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,034
Who's the stranger lady?

38
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,784
We were waiting for you
to watch Elvis.

39
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:04,703
Why don't you go on and
make us some lemonade?

40
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:07,182
Grab your daddy a beer.

41
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:12,961
She your girlfriend?

42
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:16,944
Well, I guess yeah.

43
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,889
Yeah,she is.

44
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:23,364
Ain't no lemons.

45
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:27,796
Thank you.

46
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:31,510
Yeah,she's going to stay
with me for a while.

47
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,164
What's your name?

48
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:35,466
Ellen.

49
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,917
My name is Ellen.

50
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,886
That's nice.

51
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:44,034
You could be like my mum and dad.

52
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,244
Lou and Ellen makes
Lewellen,makes me.

53
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:49,843
You're my mom and dad.

54
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,772
Yeah..

55
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,457
Elvis is on.

56
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:57,521
Why don't you got to do
some singing for us?

57
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:12,452
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog,

58
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,974
cryin' all the time.

59
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:20,807
You ain't nothin' but a hound
dog, cryin' all the time.

60
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:23,912
Well,You ain't never caught a rabbit,

61
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,770
and you ain't no friend of mine.

62
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:28,535
Well, they said you was high class.

63
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,224
Well, that was just a lie.

64
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:32,993
Well, they said you was high class.

65
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:35,306
Well, that was just a lie.

66
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:42,425
Well ,you ain't never comin' 'round
and you ain't no friend of mine.

67
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:48,844
Stop playing that devil music.

68
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,533
You always listen to Elvis.

69
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:57,310
I listen to the lords music,
you can always listen to that.

70
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,732
You better stop that shaking, because
you get yourself into a lot of trouble.

71
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,316
I want that song sung
at my funeral one day,girl.

72
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,058
You make sure of that for me.

73
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,576
I'm going down to my daddy's to
visit him with the stranger lady

74
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,410
No, ma'am, you're not.

75
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:37,793
Please, for a little while,

76
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:41,177
No,ma'am,
you ain't going down to witness that evil.

77
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:45,463
mind your daddy, just the
thought is playing the devil,

78
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:47,775
It's like he did with my baby.

79
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:51,079
He would'nt even got married
after he got off over you

80
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:53,935
I had to drag him down
to the church myself

81
00:07:56,914 --> 00:08:00,063
Well.. help me clear the dishes
and we'll...

82
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:03,805
come out here and have
some ice cream on the swing.

83
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,730
Sorry babe, but you can't come in,
okay?

84
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:11,518
Stay there.

85
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:16,239
What flavor you going to get today?

86
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:18,353
- Vanilla.
- Vanilla?

87
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:21,837
I always get vanilla,
I try the flavor and I always get vanilla.

88
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,983
Will you go get my shoes for me honey?

89
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,132
Why doesn't the momma toki
sit on her own eggs?

90
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:34,197
It's too big,she'll break them,

91
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:37,350
she'll keep the nursemaid on till
they hatch, to keep warm.

92
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:41,174
What's that?

93
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:45,500
carefree what,you stay in front of the
house, and I'll run out back and get the car.

94
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,807
keep it... bring with my shoes.
Alright.

95
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,247
Why cant you wait
'til we were gone?

96
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:53,248
couldn't wait

97
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,167
What do you doing with it?
why are you dragging it?

98
00:09:57,402 --> 00:09:59,943
- going to bury him. Damn it. Just let me
get her to a store or something.

99
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:13,935
Honey...

100
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:57,824
Missy, you gonna fall out of
that tree and bust your behind.

101
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:04,691
How many years I'm been telling you
there's more to singing than just Elvis?

102
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:08,419
When you going to sing
some real "blues" girl?

103
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:11,266
- I can't sing "blues. "
- Why not?

104
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,533
- I ain't black.
- You ain't?

105
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:16,616
- I ain't.
- I thought you were.

106
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:22,418
Hey,Elvis is a white boy
singing black music.

107
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,810
So you are a white girl
singing black music.

108
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:31,045
I just want you to know there is more to
fill all that emptiness working just Elvis.

109
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,756
I'm going to be a big star some day.

110
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:36,756
My daddy said so,

111
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:38,398
Yes,ma'am.

112
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:40,468
You just might..

113
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:46,601
but if you don't, you keep on singing,
keep on feeling the spirit

114
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:50,341
If your dreams gotta go
underground for awhile..

115
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:53,507
bury themselves deep in the earth,
so they can survive,

116
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:57,553
you just keep feeling the
spirit even in the dark

117
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:17,253
Guess what I heard.

118
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:19,122
- What?
- Guess.

119
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:20,582
No, tell me.

120
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,698
- I heard Elvis is coming to town.
Elvis is coming to town?

121
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:24,699
Lewellen?

122
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:27,388
When?

123
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:30,356
I don't know,I think he's coming to Polar
edge that's all I heard that he's coming.

124
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:31,988
Lewellen, is someone there?

125
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,309
No, ma'am.

126
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:35,605
Okay, meet me on the bank tomorrow.

127
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:37,544
Can't day after?
- Okay,day after.

128
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:42,714
Your bath is ready, come on in,
let me check for ticks.

129
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,518
- Who was that I hear?
- What?

130
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:02,771
You heard me. Aren't you talking to
someone. Who were you talking to?

131
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:04,349
Nobody.

132
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,232
Better not be anyone of those
boys want to do evil things with you.

133
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:09,561
No, ma'am.

134
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:13,964
Stand.

135
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:31,297
Plenty of time for you to grow
up and do all kinds of evil,

136
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:35,407
but I just want you to be
good ,while you still can

137
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,529
Gotta long time before you
need to be growing up.

138
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,483
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:09,209
Got lemons...

140
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:16,823
What you got there?

141
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:19,874
Lemons.

142
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,786
You know,those cars have been out there
as long as I can remember.

143
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:38,244
I don't know why your dad don't clean all
empty things out

144
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,335
and just lets them collect there.

145
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,079
Just emptiness piling on emptiness,

146
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:46,817
Possibly gets his high on emptiness.

147
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:51,745
Want to come help make some lemonade?

148
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,189
Okay.

149
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,350
Here.

150
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:13,001
Oh,No, not now, honey. Thank you.

151
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:16,607
No, it's for your face... it'll help.

152
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,367
I can't believe how big you are.

153
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,394
'Cause I'm in second grade.

154
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,630
How did you learn to make
lemonade so good?

155
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:40,876
Grammy.

156
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:46,368
Where is he?

157
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:50,137
He's gone.

158
00:15:51,857 --> 00:15:53,027
He's coming back?

159
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:56,222
He"ll come back!

160
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:58,268
What did you do to him?

161
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,686
You say something bad?Made him mad,
and make him leave?

162
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:03,124
I'm sorry, honey.

163
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:05,534
No, you are a liar,
my daddy wouldn't leave me.

164
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:09,699
He said ,he was leaving you with me.
He did not.

165
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,931
He did not,you stupid,
I hate you.

166
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:14,931
It's all your fault,
my daddy wouldn't  leave me.

167
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:17,442
He'll come back, you'll see,
he will for me.

168
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,823
Lou?

169
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:10,425
No, ma'am. It's me, Lewellen.

170
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:18,536
You want to come in here ,with me?
- Yes,ma'am.

171
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,736
He'll be home soon...

172
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:36,701
I always feel it in my
toes when he goes.

173
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:39,700
It's like I feel the rain coming.

174
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:43,818
You gonna stay?

175
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:51,599
Sing your Elvis for me, baby.Will you?

176
00:17:57,925 --> 00:17:59,870
Will you take me with
you when you leave?

177
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:03,497
Please.

178
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:11,342
Yeah.

179
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:20,331
Where's Vernon?

180
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:22,838
He's gone.

181
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:24,720
But I heard they weren't
movin' till next week.

182
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:25,794
No.

183
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,033
You the Wooden's Boy?

184
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:30,024
Yeah, how'd you know?

185
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,069
Vernon told me your face was.

186
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:35,987
I mean, I don't know.

187
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,665
Vernon told me you me
you was takin' over.

188
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:41,591
Where are the empties?

189
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:44,245
By the screen door.

190
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:07,382
You know Elvis is comin' to town

191
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,118
I'm gonna sing for him.

192
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:43,686
Gotta go.

193
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,270
Look...

194
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:17,712
This ain't your car.

195
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,652
Hey,I said this ain't your car.

196
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:24,409
No,it's the lady out in front of my truck.

197
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:42,004
- So...
- So?

198
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:51,681
Lewellen, I'm sorry. I just
... I had some business

199
00:22:51,682 --> 00:22:52,682
I had to tend to back at home.

200
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh, I just had such busy, busy things to do.
I just forgot all about 'em, plumb forgot

201
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:58,053
Silly me.

202
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:01,596
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
said that about your daddy,

203
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:02,597
that he said he was gonna
leave you with me.

204
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:03,979
He didn't say that.

205
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,611
He'll come back,he always does.

206
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:10,748
Oh, I've known your daddy for a
long, long time. He's always comin' back.

207
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,172
I didn't just meet your daddy at some
local bar like I did this man towin' my car.

208
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,872
I've known him for a long time.

209
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,278
Oh, rescue me! Rescue me please!

210
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:23,752
I'm a sinner and a liar
and sinner! Please rescue me!

211
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:25,892
You know this kid?

212
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:29,500
No.

213
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,620
You promised me you'd take me with you
Get away from the truck, kid.

214
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,762
Who was that?

215
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:49,288
I don't know.

216
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,919
You acted like you knew her.

217
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:52,706
No...

218
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,769
Feeling the spirit in the dark?

219
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,150
I am thinking about snakes.

220
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,187
Oh snake medicine people are rare.

221
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:29,397
Rare...

222
00:24:30,892 --> 00:24:35,942
Their initiation... comes from giving and
living through many,many snake bites.

223
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:40,257
makes them able to change all poisons.

224
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:47,503
Poison in the body, poison in the mind or
poison in the heart,

225
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,088
poison in the soul.

226
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:58,177
Turn them by some poison,which can
kill you,into something powerful and good.

227
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:06,586
This will fix you right up...

228
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:18,621
- She's singing Elvis.
She's something, ain't she?

229
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:23,149
- But she's singing it all wrong.
Oh no,missy,she's singing it all right.

230
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,066
But that's Elvis' song.

231
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:26,749
- No,maam.
- Is so.

232
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,629
Missy,that's Willie Mae Thornton

233
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:34,866
They call her"Big Mama" now, she hit
number one with "Hounddog" in 1953,

234
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,509
long before Elvis
sang that song.

235
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,775
Come on.

236
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,643
You can't tell nobody I can't swim.

237
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:40,871
I won't.

238
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:44,628
You gotta promise.
I promise.

239
00:27:45,044 --> 00:27:46,998
And you can't tell nobody you rescued me.

240
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:48,104
I won't.

241
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,882
Hey, I'll teach you how to swim, okay?

242
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:56,267
And how to dance like Elvis?

243
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,963
Yeah, and sing.

244
00:28:00,252 --> 00:28:01,208
Can I come?

245
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:02,715
Yeah, we're goin' together.

246
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:04,878
No, I mean if Elvis takes you with him.

247
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:06,297
you gotta go,right?

248
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:07,983
right

249
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,898
Lewellen,can I come too?

250
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:15,821
well you know I don't know
if that will be okay...

251
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:19,829
or what, I don't if it will just be me.

252
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:23,402
Yeah I know... okay.

253
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,462
But you can ask Elvis
when we see him.

254
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:29,238
Okay.

255
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:39,776
Hi there Buddy, bring your girlfriend?

256
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:47,285
Let's see, ditch house for your girlfriend?

257
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,588
Daddy..

258
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,537
Bring me a six-pack, baby.

259
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:28,037
Hey Buddy.

260
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:30,221
- Hello, sir, how you doing?
- I'm good..

261
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,817
- Kinda hot out there,are you?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:37,337
Thanks, baby.

263
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:50,565
Well,I got you something.

264
00:29:50,949 --> 00:29:52,998
What'd you get me? What'd
I get, what'd I get?

265
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:55,970
Let me see if I can find it.

266
00:29:56,977 --> 00:29:58,774
Let's see, where'd I put it?

267
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,044
Baby, I can't seem to find it.
I just don't know where it is.

268
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:05,128
Daddy..

269
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,236
Harder.

270
00:30:58,337 --> 00:30:59,177
Hurry.

271
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:38,063
Lewellen? Lewellen?

272
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:40,194
Missy,I know you're hiding there.

273
00:31:42,463 --> 00:31:44,744
This ain't no time for your hiding games.

274
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,774
Your daddy's been struck by lightning.

275
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:49,389
What?

276
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:51,058
Your daddy's been struck.

277
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:52,152
By lightning?

278
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:53,778
By God.

279
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,675
Is he dead?

280
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,402
For your sins, was it.

281
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:00,420
No, ma'am.

282
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:01,582
You better run, boy.

283
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,249
We were doing nothing.

284
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,869
Is he dead? Is my daddy dead?

285
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:14,584
Maybe it was you who struck him down.

286
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:19,528
What were doing out in that shack,
while you daddy was out working the fields?

287
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:22,565
What were you doing,missy?

288
00:32:23,954 --> 00:32:24,753
Nothing.

289
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:02,043
Can I go for an ice cream?

290
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:04,717
One scoop,you'll spoil your dinner.

291
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:08,057
Be home before dark.

292
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:12,389
Lewellen? Stay out of the tall grass.

293
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:14,864
Snakes are in the tall grass.

294
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:21,011
He's stupid now,right?

295
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:22,179
No.

296
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:24,481
That's what my daddy says.

297
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:25,712
Well,he's not.

298
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:41,652
It is poisonous?

299
00:33:41,914 --> 00:33:43,009
No, stupid.

300
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,664
Hold your arm out.

301
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,436
Come on,it won't hurt you,
it feels good.

302
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:01,992
Wow... yeah.

303
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:04,148
Can I have it?

304
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,404
Sure.

305
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:11,070
I gotta go.

306
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:12,971
Why? It ain't dark yet.

307
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:14,320
I gotta go.

308
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:23,333
Lightning struck...

309
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:25,884
first thing, it gives an awful thirst

310
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,899
You have to keep a close watch on him,

311
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:31,777
'Cause they'll try to drink the entire river.

312
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:38,130
I was in Pensacola

313
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,602
fishing with my brother,

314
00:34:41,725 --> 00:34:43,836
we saw a man crazy with thirsty

315
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:48,696
He was drinking the ocean water like
it was whiskey, died from the salt.

316
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:03,348
Just gotta always be careful
handling the dead snake.

317
00:35:03,973 --> 00:35:06,105
Always use the stick.

318
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,021
Reflex action make the poison of a
snake bite even after he's dead.

319
00:35:12,012 --> 00:35:13,863
Grammie says you must
drink whiskey,if you're bit.

320
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:16,826
It gets right in the blood
and kills the poison.

321
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,901
Always drink whiskey for a snake bite?

322
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:24,329
But only the celebrities
who are still alive make it known.

323
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:28,608
That whiskey will move that poison
so fast through your blood ,

324
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:30,714
to your heart and knock you flat dead.

325
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:39,623
You think God will strike you down
for your sins?

326
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:45,865
No,missy,I don't.

327
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,742
You think God will strike you
down for someone else's sins?

328
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,635
No,missy, I know he don't do that.

329
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,514
I'm a sinner.

330
00:36:04,218 --> 00:36:06,592
Yes, we're all sinners.

331
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:10,170
Did you ever put the sinners here,
and they gotta be got rid of..

332
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:13,795
I think God put us all here,

333
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:16,598
I think he put every single one of us here.

334
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:22,916
My daddy's thirsty all the time.

335
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:27,061
You keep a close watch on him.

336
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:40,685
What's wrong,daddy?

337
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:45,700
I can't remember my name.

338
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:48,731
Lou.

339
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,571
- Lou?
- Yeah..

340
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:55,344
and I am Lewellen,

341
00:36:55,584 --> 00:36:57,781
you shared the first part of my name,
you remember?

342
00:36:58,163 --> 00:37:00,164
The first part of my name is you,

343
00:37:00,486 --> 00:37:02,596
'Cause you're my daddy, remember?

344
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,679
What am I called Lou?
Right.

345
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:14,746
I forgot my name.

346
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:25,282
It's okay.

347
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:04,030
It's too hot...

348
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:07,695
I'll put it here
in case you feel cold.

349
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,949
Don't you want to sleep
in your bed tonight?

350
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:15,731
No,maam, I'll just sit up here.

351
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,902
Okay, call me if you need
anything.

352
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:23,261
Can I have my lightning box,please?

353
00:38:28,898 --> 00:38:31,562
Can I have one kiss, please?

354
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,848
Good night.

355
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:37,222
Why are you stealing my money?

356
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:39,844
Daddy needs more medicine.

357
00:39:40,459 --> 00:39:42,301
I went and burrowed some this morning.

358
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:46,039
Sorry.

359
00:40:04,606 --> 00:40:06,706
Take you daddy his medicine.

360
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:08,126
Yes, ma'am.

361
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,220
What is wrong with you?

362
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:37,146
Nothing.

363
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:40,972
You act like you're mad
at me or something.

364
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,309
I'm not.

365
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:01,233
I ain't no money

366
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:03,911
I can't go see Elvis.

367
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,219
Get it from your dad, can't you?

368
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:09,552
He ain't got no money, either.

369
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:12,708
I can't go see Elvis.

370
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,381
Don't worry. We'll get
the money someways.

371
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:21,688
I'll get the money,I will, I promise!

372
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:25,123
Just don't cry no more, please?

373
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:29,435
Lewellen, please, don't  cry.

374
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:30,436
Girl and boy!

375
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:33,744
Hey there, you girl and boy!

376
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:47,587
What were you doin' back there?

377
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:50,648
Nothing.

378
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,651
I saw you. You were stealin'.

379
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,938
Do you confess to me
that you were stealin'?

380
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:57,969
- Yes..
- Maam.

381
00:41:58,304 --> 00:41:59,639
Yes, maam.

382
00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:03,105
My grandmother and my
grandfather said that

383
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,119
while I'm here stayin' with them,
I am not to play with you.

384
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:08,535
But I've decided I will play with you.

385
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:10,177
My name is Gwendolyn

386
00:42:10,516 --> 00:42:12,576
but you may call me Grasshopper.

387
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,778
Grasshopper?

388
00:42:15,638 --> 00:42:16,726
What can you do?

389
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,089
She can do Elvis.
- Show me.

390
00:43:14,587 --> 00:43:18,122
My God... Elvis, Elvis.

391
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:21,596
My God! My God!

392
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:27,429
Daddy,guess what....
guess what! I saw Elvis

393
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,489
and he blew a kiss just
for me! Daddy, I saw Elvis!

394
00:43:31,548 --> 00:43:33,429
You left me alone.

395
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,440
You said you'd be back.

396
00:43:37,934 --> 00:43:38,696
I am back.

397
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:43,783
Well, you said you'd be right back,
and you didn't come right back.

398
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,898
I thought you were gone.

399
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,094
I'm sorry.

400
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:53,123
You won't leave me, will you?

401
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:59,046
Promise you'll stay with me for always.
Promise you won't leave me again.

402
00:44:00,761 --> 00:44:01,738
I promise.

403
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:06,059
It's late for my medicine.

404
00:44:18,914 --> 00:44:20,819
I love you, Elvis.

405
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:43,600
Guess what!
- What?

406
00:44:43,902 --> 00:44:45,614
- I saw Elvis.
Did not.

407
00:44:45,798 --> 00:44:47,811
Did! And he blew me a kiss!
You're a liar.

408
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:48,987
I am not.

409
00:44:49,246 --> 00:44:51,087
Are!
Am not, you stupid!

410
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:57,125
Well, can you meet me on the bank?

411
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:59,014
No, I can't. I gotta
finish this for Grammie.

412
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,081
Just for a little?

413
00:45:00,316 --> 00:45:01,972
No, I can't. I gotta do this.

414
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:02,937
What is this?

415
00:45:03,216 --> 00:45:04,283
Makin' jelly.

416
00:45:04,488 --> 00:45:05,247
How about tomorrow?

417
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:07,722
Well, I don't know. I gotta
get ready for Elvis.

418
00:45:09,952 --> 00:45:11,619
My Grammie's comin'. You better scoot.

419
00:45:18,123 --> 00:45:20,356
I cannot believe, I forgot the sugar.

420
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:21,958
How's it coming?Let me see.

421
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,927
Just in time,it's ready.

422
00:45:24,134 --> 00:45:25,199
Oh,Good girl.

423
00:45:52,512 --> 00:45:53,942
- Hey!
- Hey!

424
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:56,837
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

425
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,555
Can you come now to the bank?
- No.

426
00:46:01,188 --> 00:46:02,511
I'll show you something.

427
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,294
No,I can't.

428
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:05,825
How come?

429
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:07,976
Got my ticket,yet?

430
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,281
Not yet,

431
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:10,944
may be, I promise.

432
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,086
Go home.

433
00:46:12,351 --> 00:46:14,634
- Can I come with you?
- Go home, Buddy...

434
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:17,369
And I did see Elvis too.

435
00:46:37,943 --> 00:46:39,461
Can you do my hair like yours?

436
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:01,083
- You're late,missy.
- Sorry.

437
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:08,263
What in God's name have you have on?

438
00:48:09,459 --> 00:48:10,170
It's a dress.

439
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,540
Don't 'smart alec' me missy
I see it is a dress,

440
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:15,709
- Where did you get it?
- I like your hair-do.

441
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,402
- Grasshopper.
- What?

442
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,058
You know Ellen I like your hair.

443
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,200
- Grasshopper, she's a girl.
Whose girl?

444
00:48:24,387 --> 00:48:25,435
You sure. I sure do.

445
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:29,147
Mr. and Mrs. Chamber's granddaughter.
.. she's visiting them for the summer.

446
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:31,909
I like your hair like that, Lewellen,
I really do.

447
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:33,256
I like it a lot.

448
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:35,615
Did you steal it?

449
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:36,739
No, ma'am.

450
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,528
Well I better not hear tomorrow that,
that girl is missing her dress!

451
00:48:42,725 --> 00:48:43,661
You understand?

452
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,425
She give it to me.

453
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:48,794
Well,you sit down and
eat your dinner then.

454
00:48:54,283 --> 00:48:56,086
Remember you going to help me,

455
00:48:56,087 --> 00:48:59,063
I have the jelly the church,
for the bake sale on Sunday.

456
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:00,456
I sure do like your hair.

457
00:49:00,457 --> 00:49:01,457
It's neat.

458
00:51:03,038 --> 00:51:03,824
What?

459
00:51:04,983 --> 00:51:05,996
Sit on my lap.

460
00:51:06,857 --> 00:51:07,530
Why?

461
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:09,662
Because it feels so good.

462
00:51:13,327 --> 00:51:14,375
You should get up now.

463
00:51:15,946 --> 00:51:17,368
Something different?

464
00:51:18,565 --> 00:51:19,205
What?

465
00:51:20,028 --> 00:51:20,889
Got to guess.

466
00:51:23,731 --> 00:51:25,415
Oh, no, daddy. What did you do?

467
00:51:25,976 --> 00:51:27,249
I cut my bangs.

468
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:28,632
Why did you do that?

469
00:51:29,905 --> 00:51:31,553
Because I wanted to be cool like you.

470
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:35,779
Do you like it?

471
00:51:37,653 --> 00:51:38,438
Why don't you like it?

472
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:41,094
Yeah,I like it.

473
00:51:51,022 --> 00:51:51,829
- Hey
- Hey

474
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:54,411
Here's what I got your ticket.
You got it?

475
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:57,254
- Yeah.
- My God,I can't believe you got it.

476
00:51:57,553 --> 00:51:58,526
- Yeah.
- How do you get it?

477
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:01,053
A friend of mine, but you
got to meet me at the bank

478
00:52:01,232 --> 00:52:02,929
because I gotta go get them
because he still got them.

479
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:05,563
Okay, I have to finish this for
my grandmother, but I will meet you.

480
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:14,418
Missy?

481
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:16,513
What's you in such a hurry for?

482
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:18,534
Come on in here, out of the rain.

483
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:22,275
Can't.I gotta get my Elvis ticket,
I got a ticket for Elvis.

484
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:26,875
Hurry up.

485
00:52:27,438 --> 00:52:28,523
Buddy I'm coming.

486
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:31,368
Hurry.

487
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:40,869
Oh my God, you scared me!

488
00:52:42,404 --> 00:52:43,076
What are you doing here?

489
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:44,948
I told him to meet us here.

490
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,668
He wants to see you do your Elvis dance.

491
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:49,062
I told him you'd do
your Elvis dance for him.

492
00:52:49,438 --> 00:52:51,831
Oh. Well, do you have my ticket?

493
00:52:57,031 --> 00:52:58,750
You have to do your Elvis dance first.

494
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:00,136
Why?

495
00:53:00,435 --> 00:53:01,146
That was the deal.

496
00:53:01,707 --> 00:53:03,544
He said he'd get the tickets
if you did your Elvis dance.

497
00:53:04,031 --> 00:53:06,051
Do the one you did that mornin'.
Hound dog?

498
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:07,510
Yeah.
- Okay.

499
00:53:18,243 --> 00:53:18,841
Why?

500
00:53:19,516 --> 00:53:20,152
That's the deal.

501
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:24,714
Then I get my ticket?

502
00:53:25,314 --> 00:53:25,911
Yeah.

503
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:33,881
No stupid, you have to take
it all the way off.

504
00:54:02,815 --> 00:54:03,527
Can I have my ticket now?

505
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:04,910
I have a feeling about you.

506
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:06,856
Please can I have my ticket now?

507
00:54:07,604 --> 00:54:08,390
- Yeah
- Please.

508
00:54:12,094 --> 00:54:13,258
- Come on.
- I just want my ticket.Please.

509
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,698
- Sing.
- No.

510
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,821
Sing.

511
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:19,290
Sing.

512
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,397
Help me, please.

513
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:28,829
Sings yer Elvis.

514
00:54:59,856 --> 00:55:00,791
Let's go, you drive the truck.

515
00:55:01,054 --> 00:55:03,337
- No, I don't want to.
- Come on!

516
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:55,683
I got your lightning box.

517
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:10,804
Got these men coming down
from New York,Florida.

518
00:58:11,477 --> 00:58:13,610
Say,brother Ronny why do you
preach against Rock n Roll music?

519
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:17,317
Well,the first reason I preach against it,is
because of this right here the word of God.

520
00:58:17,505 --> 00:58:19,600
- Amen
- Amen.. I believe this music...

521
00:58:20,353 --> 00:58:23,944
is 100% responsible for the delinquency
of our youth today.

522
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,497
And the reason I believe that, 'cause
I know what it feels like when you sing.

523
00:58:27,873 --> 00:58:29,108
I know what it feels like
when you listen to it,

524
00:58:29,729 --> 00:58:31,838
I know the evil thoughts and desires that
come over..

525
00:58:32,025 --> 00:58:33,309
you when you get swept away in the beat.

526
00:58:34,584 --> 00:58:35,527
And you ask an average young person,

527
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,056
what it is they like this music so much they
are going to tell you one thing.

528
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:42,514
Didn't I tell you,it's the beat.
it's the beat,it's the beat.

529
00:58:42,927 --> 00:58:44,347
it's the beat!

530
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,481
And we are a music loving church here,

531
00:58:47,266 --> 00:58:49,699
we sing our hymns of praise
each and every week to the Lord

532
00:58:50,502 --> 00:58:52,595
The Bible says, make a joyful
noise unto the Lord,

533
00:58:53,157 --> 00:58:57,048
but there is nothing joyful
about this rock n roll music, because...

534
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:11,832
Thank you very much,
thanks for coming.

535
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:14,076
May God bless you.

536
00:59:23,483 --> 00:59:26,027
- I don't feel good.
- What's the matter with you? Are you sick?

537
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:29,283
- Yes,maam.
- Lewellen,there's your boyfriend.

538
00:59:31,004 --> 00:59:32,313
- Can I go home now.
In a few minutes,

539
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,662
I gotta check on  my jelly.

540
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,104
I'm going for a barf .
- You're,now just calm youself .

541
00:59:37,966 --> 00:59:38,826
I'll be right back.

542
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:40,473
Buddy.

543
00:59:41,147 --> 00:59:41,932
Buddy, Buddy.

544
00:59:42,944 --> 00:59:44,044
Who  you friend?

545
00:59:44,606 --> 00:59:45,504
This is the Grasshopper.

546
00:59:46,103 --> 00:59:47,825
Buddy's taking me to see
Elvis tonight.

547
00:59:48,874 --> 00:59:53,253
You are?Oh,you heard that,Lewellen?

548
00:59:54,493 --> 00:59:55,915

549
00:59:57,187 --> 00:59:57,764
Gwendolyn..

550
00:59:58,385 --> 01:00:01,570
- You can come and have ice cream with us,if you like.
- Yes, ma'am.

551
01:00:02,095 --> 01:00:02,771
Come on.

552
01:00:03,038 --> 01:00:03,941
Okay,bye,bye, Buddy.

553
01:00:04,652 --> 01:00:05,400
Bye,bye, Grasshopper.

554
01:00:06,074 --> 01:00:07,347
Grasshopper bye,I like your name.

555
01:00:08,919 --> 01:00:12,698
We're gonna have some
of Grammie' jelly.

556
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:52,968
Lewellen.

557
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:56,598
Lewellen.

558
01:02:17,924 --> 01:02:18,786
Lewellen.

559
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:24,172
Lewellen.

560
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:43,591
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Buddy.

561
01:02:43,817 --> 01:02:45,238
- Thank you.
- Bye, Grasshopper.

562
01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:46,810
Bye Buddy.
Bye ma'am.

563
01:02:47,073 --> 01:02:47,860
Bye, Buddy.

564
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:54,331
- Hey,guys.
- Hello, Buddy.

565
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,501
Get into, guys.

566
01:02:56,803 --> 01:02:57,401
Come on.

567
01:03:16,637 --> 01:03:17,834
I will show you how it's done.

568
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:22,023
Lewellen.

569
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:23,183
Lewellen.

570
01:03:25,241 --> 01:03:25,803
Lewellen.

571
01:03:28,873 --> 01:03:31,604
- Oh, Buddy.
- Get away from me.

572
01:03:32,389 --> 01:03:34,522
- I cannot find the Lewellen.
- Where will you think you going?

573
01:03:35,195 --> 01:03:35,905
I ain't seen her.

574
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:42,078
Go on, cowboy.

575
01:03:44,284 --> 01:03:45,296
Don't do that.

576
01:03:52,064 --> 01:03:52,925
You dance just like your girl.

577
01:05:27,676 --> 01:05:28,499
You are so stupid.

578
01:05:29,584 --> 01:05:31,791
- You are so stupid.
I dont like these things?

579
01:05:31,981 --> 01:05:33,625
- You are so stupid.
- I can't stand it.

580
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,435
- You are so stupid.
- I can't stand it anymore.

581
01:05:37,182 --> 01:05:39,426
- You are so stupid.
- I can't stand it anymore.

582
01:05:39,652 --> 01:05:41,820
- You are so stupid.
- I can't stand it anymore.

583
01:06:46,693 --> 01:06:47,329
Mom...

584
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:52,864
My daughter is dead.

585
01:06:53,724 --> 01:06:54,211
Mamma...

586
01:07:02,213 --> 01:07:06,442
I told you,if you ever set
foot on this property again,I'll kill you.

587
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:08,051
What do you want?

588
01:07:10,857 --> 01:07:13,774
- I want to care of Lewellen.
Lewellen is fine.

589
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,776
But I want to take her with me.
You can't her with you,she's mine.

590
01:07:20,694 --> 01:07:22,900
You said she's yours,
her daddy thinks she's his..

591
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:25,519
- And you think she's yours?
- No, I don't.

592
01:07:25,968 --> 01:07:27,051
I don't think she's anybodys.

593
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:30,680
Only person she belongs to, is herself.

594
01:07:30,831 --> 01:07:32,814
Oh,that's hard for you to talk,you sinner.

595
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:38,873
I loved him.

596
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:42,696
You sinned,with your
 own sister's husband.

597
01:07:43,332 --> 01:07:46,026
You made him marry her.
- He got her pregnant.

598
01:07:46,474 --> 01:07:49,055
But he loved me, mom.
I was the one, he loved.

599
01:07:49,617 --> 01:07:51,451
So what was he doing sleeping
with your sister?

600
01:07:51,826 --> 01:07:54,033
It was just once, one time
and he didn't even mean it.

601
01:07:54,296 --> 01:07:56,052
Lewellen should have been mine,
and you know it.

602
01:07:56,692 --> 01:07:58,149
Because I was the one that he loved.

603
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:59,422
He never loved you.

604
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:04,022
You wanted him too.

605
01:08:05,295 --> 01:08:06,678
That's why you still
 keeping him around.

606
01:08:13,859 --> 01:08:14,795
Go on,shoot me, mom.

607
01:08:16,777 --> 01:08:17,712
Go on.

608
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:23,493
I need someone to care of...

609
01:08:25,699 --> 01:08:27,570
You can't even take care of yourself..

610
01:08:29,851 --> 01:08:31,086
She needs a mamma.

611
01:08:31,534 --> 01:08:32,956
I am her mamma.

612
01:08:37,471 --> 01:08:38,106
I need you...

613
01:08:40,914 --> 01:08:41,886
Mama, please.

614
01:08:44,058 --> 01:08:44,994
I need you...

615
01:08:49,033 --> 01:08:49,710
I told you.

616
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:52,740
My daughter is dead.

617
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:00,899
Missy.

618
01:10:03,217 --> 01:10:03,965
Did you get the ticket?

619
01:10:04,603 --> 01:10:05,426
No.

620
01:10:05,988 --> 01:10:06,549
Why not?

621
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:08,823
Don't want it.

622
01:10:10,705 --> 01:10:12,761
Come here,hold on to this colt,
while I fix the record.

623
01:10:33,627 --> 01:10:34,226
What's that?

624
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:37,408
That's a mighty ugly you got there.

625
01:10:39,727 --> 01:10:40,998
You better care of that.

626
01:12:10,707 --> 01:12:11,305
Rattler?

627
01:12:11,717 --> 01:12:13,252
Mama always told me not...

628
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:14,972
walk in the tall grass.

629
01:12:51,631 --> 01:12:53,390
Keep it cool, boy.

630
01:13:44,538 --> 01:13:45,030
Mom?

631
01:13:55,584 --> 01:13:56,220
Mama..

632
01:14:28,076 --> 01:14:29,160
Charles?

633
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,013
I remember those late nights.

634
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:30,718
and I'll be up on your mama's lap.

635
01:15:31,766 --> 01:15:34,011
She was so big and soft and warm.

636
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:36,630
hold me there.. like there and

637
01:15:36,781 --> 01:15:39,888
there'll be a big fire blazing
with you and Lucy and Willie May..

638
01:15:41,682 --> 01:15:42,993
And we all would play,

639
01:15:43,967 --> 01:15:45,729
It was so beautiful, I just had to cry,

640
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:48,033
I was feeling so safe there
in your mamma's arms.

641
01:15:48,329 --> 01:15:49,758
And when we was all finished singing

642
01:15:49,759 --> 01:15:50,759
mamma will carry you across the field

643
01:15:51,443 --> 01:15:54,117
and slip into the kitchen door
and put you in your bed...

644
01:15:54,123 --> 01:15:55,118
Without waking your mamma.

645
01:15:55,339 --> 01:16:00,848
Oh,your mamma was good.
She was so good.

646
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:02,982
God, I miss her.

647
01:16:05,863 --> 01:16:07,098
I do miss her.

648
01:16:13,608 --> 01:16:14,955
Why don't you take  Lewellen?

649
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:20,533
- I can't...
- You could.

650
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:27,600
Her eyes are too big,
it makes me scared.

651
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:29,952
Looking in the mirror.

652
01:16:31,514 --> 01:16:32,955
Oh,no I feel I up....

653
01:16:34,253 --> 01:16:37,842
 I can't breathe sometimes,I feel I get
 all choked up,when I'm near her.

654
01:16:38,815 --> 01:16:41,060
Maybe you, finally be putting your arms 


655
01:16:41,547 --> 01:16:43,744
all round yourself the way
 your mamma never could.

656
01:16:51,935 --> 01:16:54,927
- Mammas.
- Mammas.

657
01:17:10,594 --> 01:17:11,455
Lewellen.

658
01:17:14,707 --> 01:17:16,055
Why won't you say nothing?

659
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:20,992
Why can not I talk?

660
01:17:38,892 --> 01:17:39,643
Lord,

661
01:17:40,358 --> 01:17:41,033
please

662
01:17:41,672 --> 01:17:42,869
is that my baby improves

663
01:17:43,881 --> 01:17:45,117
please, dear Lord.

664
01:17:48,746 --> 01:17:49,908
Not to let die.

665
01:17:53,572 --> 01:17:54,507
I do not know what I did.

666
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:57,462
I can not stand.

667
01:17:59,071 --> 01:18:00,192
Please, Lord,

668
01:18:00,978 --> 01:18:01,764
please.

669
01:18:18,025 --> 01:18:18,737
- Sing.
- No.

670
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,908
- Sing.
- No.

671
01:19:02,827 --> 01:19:04,660
You hear? Not provide.

672
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,240
Yes

673
01:19:08,138 --> 01:19:11,017
- Think you dance too?
- I like Elvis.

674
01:19:18,582 --> 01:19:19,556
Do not drink anything.

675
01:19:19,818 --> 01:19:20,754
I smoke a cigarette.

676
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:23,636
I think she will die.

677
01:19:24,123 --> 01:19:24,684
What do you say?

678
01:19:25,134 --> 01:19:26,742
- And if she tell?
- It will not.

679
01:19:27,043 --> 01:19:30,036
And you begin to speak during sleep?
You can do this...

680
01:19:30,262 --> 01:19:31,049
Stop worry about.

681
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:34,605
- She could die and it is our fault...
- It is not my fault if she dies.

682
01:19:35,018 --> 01:19:37,226
- Did you meteste the inside.
- No more.

683
01:19:37,823 --> 01:19:38,313
Yes

684
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:41,904
What is supposed meter? A man is
supposed to come inside a woman.

685
01:19:42,698 --> 01:19:43,411
Yes

686
01:19:44,757 --> 01:19:45,581
Sure.

687
01:20:37,682 --> 01:20:39,557
You have a dark spirit in you.

688
01:20:41,951 --> 01:20:43,709
A spirit that tries to wake you.

689
01:20:45,881 --> 01:20:47,302
Want to sleep a little more.

690
01:20:49,286 --> 01:20:50,370
Hide it.

691
01:20:53,176 --> 01:20:54,187
We kid.

692
01:21:10,844 --> 01:21:12,265
Go inside.

693
01:21:13,799 --> 01:21:14,436
Vai is well.

694
01:21:15,807 --> 01:21:17,154
I'll be with you soon.

695
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:22,575
What do you want?

696
01:21:24,008 --> 01:21:25,879
I want you to come in and sing with me.

697
01:21:27,225 --> 01:21:28,048
I don't feel good.

698
01:21:29,282 --> 01:21:30,031
I know, missie,

699
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:31,789
I know.

700
01:21:33,285 --> 01:21:34,033
I wanna go home.

701
01:21:35,231 --> 01:21:38,074
Just come in and sing one song with me first.

702
01:21:39,533 --> 01:21:40,170
Leave me alone.

703
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:42,639
I ain't goin' to.
I really don't want to!

704
01:21:45,032 --> 01:21:46,528
What you gonna do with that hole?

705
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:54,084
When what you love is stolen and
ripped away from you, there's a hole there.

706
01:21:54,757 --> 01:21:56,216
- What you going to do with it?
- Shut up.

707
01:21:57,226 --> 01:21:59,656
You got to fill all those empty hollow places.

708
01:22:00,032 --> 01:22:01,790
You gotta fill 'em when they turn mean.

709
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:04,262
They turn mean and eat you alive.

710
01:22:04,526 --> 01:22:05,088
Mean!

711
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:06,701
You're just a nigger, you know?

712
01:22:07,075 --> 01:22:08,123
just a nigger.

713
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:11,380
So are you, missie.
No, I ain't.

714
01:22:11,567 --> 01:22:12,617
So are you,
No, I ain't.

715
01:22:12,804 --> 01:22:14,264
Oh yes, you are

716
01:22:14,489 --> 01:22:15,990
You're lettin' 'em make you one.

717
01:22:16,701 --> 01:22:18,758
It's the way people treat you that makes you a nigger.

718
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:21,381
The way people put you on down

719
01:22:21,984 --> 01:22:24,866
call you names and spit on you

720
01:22:25,201 --> 01:22:27,746
messing with you. People trying to make you hate yourself,

721
01:22:28,232 --> 01:22:30,401
taking away from you all the things you love the most.

722
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,160
You gonna let 'em do that to you?Huh?

723
01:22:33,507 --> 01:22:37,137
I ain't sayin' life ain't hard. It is. But you can't let 'em win.

724
01:22:37,361 --> 01:22:39,644
- Leave me alone.
you can't let them...

725
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:42,395
I hate you...

726
01:22:42,808 --> 01:22:43,668
I hate you...

727
01:22:44,309 --> 01:22:45,659
- Leave me alone
you can't let...

728
01:22:45,885 --> 01:22:49,138
...without your spirit
- Leave me alone, I hate you.

729
01:22:49,476 --> 01:22:50,337
Leave me alone.

730
01:22:53,756 --> 01:22:54,729
Get up. Get up.

731
01:23:52,513 --> 01:23:53,971
I can't shake no more.

732
01:23:56,102 --> 01:23:57,374
You don't have to shake.

733
01:23:58,794 --> 01:24:02,571
If you stand still you can
reach deeper into the sound.

734
01:24:11,508 --> 01:24:12,518
I can't sing.

735
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:15,066
Is hiding in the dark Lewellen.

736
01:24:16,599 --> 01:24:19,477
Stand still and reach down deep.

737
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:23,442
Stand still.

738
01:24:26,359 --> 01:24:30,061
Stand very,very still.

739
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:39,788
There it is.

740
01:26:58,322 --> 01:26:59,896
The Rattler got powerful medicine..

741
01:27:02,441 --> 01:27:04,273
If you make good when your done...

742
01:27:04,947 --> 01:27:06,892
the spirits fly free

743
01:27:07,866 --> 01:27:09,811
and the ghosts don't chase after you

744
01:27:12,768 --> 01:27:13,518
if you don't

745
01:27:14,078 --> 01:27:16,585
the spirits slither after you and drive you mad.

746
01:27:18,418 --> 01:27:22,010
Gotta always somehow make
good of what can pause in you

747
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:37,530
For you to shake.

748
01:27:56,884 --> 01:27:57,819
Look at you.

749
01:28:01,148 --> 01:28:02,119
I love you.

750
01:28:28,727 --> 01:28:29,400
What you got there?

751
01:28:41,812 --> 01:28:42,673
You know, I'm thinking...

752
01:28:45,759 --> 01:28:48,937
I got a fenced-in backyard now,
in this new place I moved in,

753
01:28:50,321 --> 01:28:51,182
It would be great for a puppy.

754
01:28:55,259 --> 01:28:56,531
But you'd have come too.

755
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,262
'Cause I could not take of it
all by myself,you know?

756
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:02,033
And you can do it.

757
01:29:04,351 --> 01:29:05,511
And he needs you.

758
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,201
I just couldn't breathe, Lewellen.

759
01:29:16,622 --> 01:29:17,633
I couldn't breathe.

760
01:29:20,702 --> 01:29:22,012
I was scared, you know?

761
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:27,212
I feel I can breathe now.

762
01:29:32,338 --> 01:29:33,645
I got a room made up for you.

763
01:29:34,842 --> 01:29:37,049
And a record player?
- Yeah,I do

764
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:38,050
I do.. got a player.

765
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,499
Just get in here,come on

766
01:29:44,266 --> 01:29:45,350
I gotta check and see.

767
01:29:51,334 --> 01:29:53,016
I just can't say you can't.. no?

768
01:29:58,424 --> 01:29:59,432
I'll wait right here.

769
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:02,802
I'll be waiting right here for you.

770
01:30:29,848 --> 01:30:30,564
Did I get it?

771
01:30:34,897 --> 01:30:35,962
I Got it.

772
01:30:36,772 --> 01:30:37,406
Daddy?

773
01:30:40,959 --> 01:30:41,707
Yes, maam.

774
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:47,952
I love you.

775
01:30:51,021 --> 01:30:52,143
Yes, maam.
