1
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:47,015
Listen, these people are marvelous.
You can't tell what they've gone through.

2
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:50,061
- You're right.
- Their courage is just absolutely amazing.

3
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:51,788
The money is well spent.

4
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:56,334
Did you see her head,
the way it was all in that sort of thing?

5
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:58,970
Dr. Bollen.

6
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,376
Dr. Bollen.

7
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:11,274
You can't leave. You're an official host.

8
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,483
Careful. Can't you tell
I'm not wearing a bra?

9
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:18,563
No.

10
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:21,310
Don't think about it.
It will only excite you.

11
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,792
That's my husband over there.

12
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:31,235
I've been married six moths
and never had an affair.

13
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,497
- Well, it can happen.
- Don't take it so well...

14
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,300
...I've just turned you down.

15
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:39,775
- Pardon me.
- He's looking at us, my husband.

16
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:43,177
Isn't he gorgeous?
He's a naval architect.

17
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,612
I must say, that has a real zing to it.

18
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:51,417
"My husband David is a naval architect."
Actually, we're starving.

19
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,923
You wouldn't want to buy
a 60-foot sloop, would you?

20
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:55,459
No.

21
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,623
David's mama and papa keep us.

22
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,266
Look how disgusted Papa looks.
He hates this sort of thing.

23
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,835
I hope you win the car, sir.

24
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:10,272
- Perhaps Papa is too sensitive.
- Sensitive, my ass. He's just bored.

25
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:14,777
Highway safety is so blah.
Besides, he hates amateurs.

26
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:17,348
Now, give him something
he can get his teeth into...

27
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:19,815
...muscular dystrophy
or rheumatoid arthritis...

28
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,281
...Papa can set the world on fire.

29
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:25,322
- He's just slumming tonight.
- Hello, Archie.

30
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:27,926
- Everyone came late.
- I came early. Good night, Wilma.

31
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,561
Good night, Barney.

32
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:36,534
- Could you describe the coat?
- It's a coat, a raincoat. With sleeves.

33
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:40,434
Archie, you can't go.
I'd be very disappointed.

34
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:43,575
All right, then, I won't tell you
who I bumped into last week.

35
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,837
- Buying a well-larded rib roast?
- Oh, smarty.

36
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:50,073
- Have you seen what she's done to her hair?
- Wild.

37
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,947
I said, "Polo, for heaven's sakes,
you look like a teenager."

38
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:57,481
And Mike's getting so thin.

39
00:04:57,695 --> 00:04:59,748
Do you think that's good
for a boy his age?

40
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:01,957
Well, if it's all right
for rib roast....

41
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:04,929
Smarty. I don't believe we've met.

42
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,090
- Get stuffed, Wilma.
- You have now.

43
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:13,704
- My name is Petulia.
- I'm not surprised.

44
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:16,967
- Polo is your wife?
- My ex-wife. Good night.

45
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:23,410
Archie. Archie!

46
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:27,318
- Say something warm.
- Like what?

47
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,182
I mean it.

48
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:31,989
All right.

49
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:35,957
- Your hair, it gleams.
- Oh, Archie.

50
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,530
- How do you brush it? Left arm or right?
- Left.

51
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:43,164
- An hour every day?
- Yes, at least.

52
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:45,964
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have
a little problem.

53
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:50,405
You see, the bursa sheath,
it's very sensitive. Bursitis. It hurts.

54
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:54,206
- Well, I'll come to you.
- I won't be much help. Just aspirin.

55
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,576
- And sympathy?
- Sure.

56
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:58,047
Thank you, Archie.

57
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:00,448
How can I have an affair
with an unmarried man?

58
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:03,418
There must be some equality of guilt.

59
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,218
My divorce doesn't become final
till next month.

60
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:08,122
I'll get my purse.

61
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,031
- Hell.
- What?

62
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,502
I'm the one to pick
the winning ticket for the car.

63
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,335
I'm always chosen for that sort of thing.
You see, I radiate incorruptibility.

64
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,704
Money can't buy me.

65
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,957
Isn't it super? Suddenly, all that love.

66
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:45,791
Well, stay, then.

67
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:48,393
Archie, why do you play this dumb game?

68
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,695
This pretense of resisting
a beautiful lady.

69
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,600
You should be jolly lucky
I'm even talking to you.

70
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:56,708
- How many kids do you have besides Mike?
- Six.

71
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:01,813
- Good night.
- Actually, there's only one besides Mike.

72
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:04,514
I'll meet you here.

73
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:19,897
- Does this bother you?
- A little.

74
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,466
Well, I suggested my place.

75
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:27,805
I'd always imagined this tourist cabin,
paper-thin walls...

76
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:30,442
...and a man from Tennessee
in the cabin next door...

77
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:34,671
...sobbing endlessly, "Maude, Maude."

78
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,449
<i>Good evening.</i>

79
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:44,653
<i>We've got an elevator, but it's only
for going for paper and the like.</i>

80
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:46,382
<i>If you don't wanna use your car.</i>

81
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:49,357
<i>But you'll have to use the ramp
because of the key.</i>

82
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:52,191
<i>The key lets you know
when you get to your room.</i>

83
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:08,341
- Charming.
- No, no, you don't understand.

84
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:10,107
It shouldn't be charming.

85
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:14,652
You're missing the whole point.
It should be menacing...

86
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,288
...gray, terribly distraught.

87
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:22,960
- And I plunge madly into your arms, and--
- My apartment's only four blocks from here.

88
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,261
Just wait a minute, will you?

89
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:07,765
My great-grandmother's 91
and she still has a granite chin.

90
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:18,674
My God, what a lecherous lot.

91
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:22,549
- Ninety-one, eh?
- Yep. But not much fun.

92
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,690
Well, 91, hell.

93
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:29,386
Oh, she stopped having fun at 28 when
her husband was killed in the first war.

94
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:35,330
In the trenches, looking just like
Cary Grant with a waxed mustache.

95
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:38,331
She can't remember him,
but she can remember Cary Grant...

96
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:42,599
...because he comes from Bristol too and,
well, he's always in the news.

97
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,903
Whenever Cary Grant's picture's
in the paper...

98
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,071
...he gets a waxed mustache
whether he likes it or not.

99
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:57,385
Stop being so damn casual.

100
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,355
We're about to become lovers.

101
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:02,294
Did you bring an instrument?

102
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:07,627
Ring room service and ask the robot to
send up something splendid and musical.

103
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,293
A saxophone? Electric organ?
Tuba?

104
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:13,166
Tuba. Absolutely. Bless you, Archie.

105
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:16,172
A tuba. Something large and whirly.

106
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:21,076
This is an event, Archie.
We're about to become lovers.

107
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,942
You said that.

108
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:25,978
- I can't say it often enough.
- Are we?

109
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:30,611
- Are we what?
- About to become lovers?

110
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,491
No.

111
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,302
You swinging young marrieds.

112
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,912
Where are you rushing to?

113
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:04,783
If we were....

114
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:06,586
If we were making love...

115
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:09,227
...you'd be exploring my nails,
something like that.

116
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:12,193
Time would be the last thing
on your mind.

117
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:22,734
You look like a gargoyle.

118
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:29,342
Poor, dumb Archie.
You see, I'm all mixed up sexually.

119
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:33,981
My mum was a prostitute.
The oldest professional lady in Bristol.

120
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:38,915
My sister too. Mavis.
Only, she's not a landmark yet.

121
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:06,616
Real, honest-to-God tears, Petulia?

122
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,819
Real tears, Archie.

123
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:14,384
Petulia, you're a kook.

124
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:34,743
If you get back in time, you can pick the
winning ticket and make somebody happy.

125
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:43,214
- I'm going to marry you, Archie.
- It's the Pepsi generation.

126
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:56,793
Hey, can you direct us
to a Chinese restaurant?

127
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,620
Okay, I'm awake.

128
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:09,200
I'll make some coffee.

129
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:11,867
Excuse me.

130
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:16,206
Aren't I a kook, though?

131
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:20,085
Well, if you think you're surprised,
think how surprised the man...

132
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:23,711
...in the pawnshop's gonna be
when he sees all that broken glass.

133
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,154
Archie, the burglar alarm didn't go off.

134
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:34,526
Where is it all going to end
if the burglar alarms don't go off?

135
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:39,293
- Take me to bed.
- Will you get the hell out of here, please?

136
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:51,713
Petulia.

137
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,289
I think I've broken a rib. I can feel it.

138
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:00,448
Don't you know
you can puncture a lung?

139
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:04,960
Carting tubas around and all that
sort of stuff. Kooky, though, isn't it?

140
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:08,926
When are you gonna stop
trying to undress me?

141
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:11,429
Look, it's just a rib to me.

142
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:14,801
Yes, I know. That's why.
Go on, go and call a proper doctor.

143
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:17,374
- What do you think I am?
- A hairy-legged old lecher...

144
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,272
...running around in shorts.

145
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:24,273
- Get your clothes off.
- Oh, as a woman, not as a rib.

146
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:45,831
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Barney? Archie.

147
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:49,099
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine, fine. Listen, Barney.

148
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:51,607
- I got a patient I want you to look at.
<i>- What? Where?</i>

149
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:54,974
- Now, in my place. My apartment.
<i>- What's he doing there?</i>

150
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:58,344
Barney, it's very complicated
and I haven't had my morning coffee.

151
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:01,145
<i>- Well, what's the name?</i>
- Her name is Petulia.

152
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,187
<i>- Petulia what?</i>
- I don't know her last name. Petulia.

153
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:06,552
<i>- Why don't you look at her yourself?</i>
- Shut up.

154
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:08,956
<i>I've gotta get to the hospital.</i>

155
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:22,071
Where are all the family pictures?

156
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:25,409
Polo and the boys.

157
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:30,445
I'll bet you called her Polo.

158
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,585
Hey, don't you go mucking about
with "Petulia."

159
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:39,414
What's her real name?

160
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:44,322
Prudence.

161
00:16:44,663 --> 00:16:48,191
And you called her Polo.
That's kind of sickening, Archie.

162
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:03,712
- And want him here every day for therapy.
- Yes, doctor. I do.

163
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:05,942
Every day, will you tell him that?

164
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:13,753
- What did he say?
- He say yes.

165
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,393
Are you sure?

166
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:19,729
Otherwise, you have to stay in the hospital.
You're not well yet. Say that to him.

167
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:27,668
I'm sorry, pal.

168
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,675
Where did he learn such words?
Shame on you.

169
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:36,814
Every day. Same time, 2:00, on the dot.
Oh, I'm sorry.

170
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,976
I like the way he heals.

171
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,418
Cut it out, you little spic.

172
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,287
- About the money, doctor--
- How is she?

173
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,456
Lunch.

174
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:52,204
His leg is going to be fine.

175
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:55,245
Don't worry too much about the bill.
Just enough to pay it.

176
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:57,642
I have the money to pay.

177
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:01,303
<i>Now we have our lovely Tina,
modeling rainwear.</i>

178
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:04,272
<i>Beauty, grace and a little sex.</i>

179
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:10,279
<i>The season's latest rave--
I mean, rage. All set for action.</i>

180
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:12,349
<i>Indecent as her....</i>

181
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:14,016
Hi.

182
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:21,953
"Get stuffed, Wilma."
Why didn't you tell me?

183
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:25,757
- How is she?
- You tell me.

184
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,031
Great. Terrific. You wouldn't believe it.
Terrific.

185
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:34,333
- How's her rib?
- I taped it.

186
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,441
Gave her some Seconal.

187
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:39,707
She should have a vertical
just to be safe.

188
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,312
- Why do we have to eat topless?
- The best Irish stew in town.

189
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:51,553
- I'll have the corned beef too. Thank you.
- Thank you.

190
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,353
She said you beat her up.

191
00:18:56,027 --> 00:18:57,393
Kidding, of course.

192
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:02,166
You must have been
a little rough on her, daddy.

193
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:06,333
- Archie?
- Barney?

194
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:09,164
You know how long I've known you?

195
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:11,367
Forever?

196
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,372
- That's how long.
- Thank you.

197
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:17,514
And Polo and the kids.
That's exactly how long.

198
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:20,447
Well, I have a right to my opinion.

199
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:24,045
This is breaking Wilma's heart.

200
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:28,519
It's all we ever talk about.

201
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:32,026
You think you're different
from anybody else?

202
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,262
Every time I leave the house,
it's the last time, I'm never coming back.

203
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:42,536
- You're not listening to me, Archie.
- Barney, for God's sake, I am listening.

204
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:45,809
You're thinking about that hot cat
in your bed, you bastard.

205
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:48,178
Look...

206
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:53,148
...my record isn't exactly spotless.
Well, you know that if anybody does.

207
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,085
There's gotta be another way, baby.

208
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:05,161
You and Polo
were a marvelous-looking couple.

209
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,491
Anything wrong with being
a great-looking couple?

210
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:13,363
People turning around to stare?
What was it, Archie? The sex bit?

211
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:15,299
The old sex bit?

212
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:23,642
What would you say if I told you that one
day I just got very tired of being married?

213
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:28,653
It's still better than being out there in
the dark all by your goddamn lonesome.

214
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:31,987
Nobody has a life anymore.

215
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:38,523
- What do you want, Archie?
- I don't know. To feel something.

216
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,193
That's no answer.

217
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,432
Grow up!

218
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:55,542
Archie...

219
00:20:56,314 --> 00:20:57,942
...what am I gonna do about Wilma?

220
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:31,874
Hey, you.

221
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,080
I'm drunk.

222
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:38,449
It's all that stuff Barney gave you.

223
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:40,685
I'm drunk.

224
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:42,520
I'll drive you home.

225
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,997
- I'll get a bus.
- Don't be silly.

226
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,701
- Don't pry, Archie.
- How am I prying?

227
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:53,068
I'll get a bus.

228
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:57,231
If I were prying, I'd ask you
how you broke your rib, right?

229
00:21:57,642 --> 00:22:00,476
So you fall on a tuba
and you break your rib, right?

230
00:22:00,645 --> 00:22:04,309
Wrong. Your rib was broken
hours before your fall.

231
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:06,909
God.

232
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:20,162
Here. I don't think it's gonna go like--
Here, here.

233
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:24,632
- Here, I'll keep it.
- It's gotta go back somewhere.

234
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,136
The Companions of the Evergreen.
Where is it?

235
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:32,903
In Chinatown. It's a lodge on Grant Street.
Mr. Howard. Mr. Howard.

236
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:36,844
- Petulia, take a cab.
- Remember that. Mr. Howard.

237
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:39,280
- Where are you going?
- Tell him I'm sorry I goofed.

238
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,379
Tell him I'm sorry
I couldn't bring it back.

239
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:43,567
You won't? I won't.

240
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:02,698
- Petulia.
- Hi.

241
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:05,503
- You okay? You sure?
- Of course.

242
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:06,906
- Just before--
- I'm okay.

243
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:10,048
- For a split second there, I thought--
- I'm fine, David.

244
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,458
I just came by...

245
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,695
...to see if there was enough food
and things.

246
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,013
<i>From the ventral aspect,
the thorax appeared normal.</i>

247
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:54,516
<i>The margins of the sternum are articulated
with the rib cartilages in the ordinary way.</i>

248
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:58,383
<i>On closer examination, the third piece
of the sternum was formed...</i>

249
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:02,084
<i>...from two centers placed laterally,
resulting in a--</i>

250
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:32,114
Hello, Polo.

251
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:33,752
Hello.

252
00:25:41,232 --> 00:25:42,996
It's very nice.

253
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:52,201
I've never been here before. It's....

254
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:55,369
- It's all very nice.
- Thank you.

255
00:26:02,553 --> 00:26:04,021
It is very strange...

256
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:08,489
...to come to your husband's
bachelor apartment for the first time.

257
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:14,861
It feels slightly illegal.

258
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,099
Is that a tuba?

259
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,199
That's a tuba.

260
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,575
Make a marvelous lamp.

261
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:32,778
- You just had to say it.
- Yeah. Predictable Polo.

262
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:36,852
"Predictable Polo," it has a certain zing.
How are the kids?

263
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:38,353
Fine.

264
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,451
Looking forward to the weekend.

265
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:47,462
Lest I forget...

266
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:53,997
- ...as usual, I baked enough for an army.
- Okay.

267
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:12,450
It's very....

268
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:14,216
It's very strange.

269
00:27:14,392 --> 00:27:16,156
I mean, I....

270
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,627
I didn't think that I'd feel like this.

271
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:24,731
- Mostly sad.
- Anything I can do for you, Polo?

272
00:27:24,902 --> 00:27:26,302
No.

273
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,570
Yes, there--

274
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:33,402
Well, yes. No.

275
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:38,683
Well, that seems to cover
all the possibilities.

276
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:47,952
It's such a puzzle to me.

277
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:55,960
I mean, we really got on so marvelously.
We never fought...

278
00:27:57,101 --> 00:28:00,128
...never screamed at each other.
Not once.

279
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:04,841
- Everybody we knew envied us.
- We were a handsome couple.

280
00:28:12,183 --> 00:28:14,846
I think that I--

281
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:17,250
I've fallen in love.

282
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:19,955
His name is Warren Smith.

283
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:22,249
He's an engineer...

284
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:24,918
...and he's very good with the children.

285
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:32,234
He wants to go back to school
and get his master's in hydraulics.

286
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:37,041
Well, say-- Say something.

287
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,700
I think that's fine, Polo.

288
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,074
Go to hell.

289
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,412
Hello? Hello?

290
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:54,252
- We're going to be married.
- Great. Hello?

291
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:57,127
<i>Hello?</i>

292
00:28:57,495 --> 00:29:00,124
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

293
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:02,233
<i>Hello?</i>

294
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:05,997
- Hi.
- Hi.

295
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,299
You okay?

296
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,637
Well, let's eat.

297
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,813
We're going to be married.

298
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:25,522
Not right away. He's....

299
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:31,760
He's also divorced,
and there's child support, alimony....

300
00:29:35,132 --> 00:29:38,432
This looks absolutely obscene.

301
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:47,241
- So the kids really like him, huh?
- Adore him.

302
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:50,047
How about that.

303
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:54,718
Do you have maid service?

304
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:58,253
What the hell are you doing
bringing me cookies?

305
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,608
Well...

306
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:27,278
...this is a new side of your nature.

307
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,984
Two people that never fight.

308
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:45,232
- What's so great about not fighting?
- I came here to tell you about Warren.

309
00:30:45,402 --> 00:30:47,803
You told me about Warren.

310
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:52,065
Warren is working on
his master's in hydraulics.

311
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:32,644
I'm....

312
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:41,521
I'm afraid I'll still need all the money
you pay me, Archie.

313
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:47,925
And I'll be seeing him at the house
until we're married.

314
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,262
Which....

315
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:55,538
Which won't be till he's established
with some hydraulics firm.

316
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:59,810
I hope it's not long,
for everybody's sake, I--

317
00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:03,940
If he's a bright enough guy,
he'll be okay.

318
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:10,444
Well, needless to say,
there are certain problems.

319
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:15,317
He lives in such
a depressing rented room...

320
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:17,893
...it gives me claustrophobia.

321
00:32:18,963 --> 00:32:21,899
It's such an icky room.

322
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:29,272
Tell the kids I'll pick up them
Sunday at 8.

323
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,407
They'll be ready.

324
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,680
I thought the decent thing to do
was to come here...

325
00:32:41,852 --> 00:32:47,223
...and discuss everything
in a civilized manner.

326
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:51,294
I mean, about the change
in my situation and all that.

327
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:56,633
- I appreciate it, Polo.
- Good night.

328
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:11,475
Now, you folks keep moving
along the bridge.

329
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:14,118
Keep moving along
and give other folks a chance.

330
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:18,620
There's a lot of pretty things to do.
You, keep moving right along.

331
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,224
You won't wanna forget
our Nipponese souvenir pagoda...

332
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:23,384
...where every item is the real McCoy.

333
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:26,854
That's right. Keep moving.
That's the ticket.

334
00:33:27,031 --> 00:33:31,765
Sergeant, you've been standing there some
time now. Would you mind moving on?

335
00:33:32,102 --> 00:33:34,435
Now, you folks keep moving
along the bridge.

336
00:33:34,605 --> 00:33:37,769
Yes, keep moving along
and give other folks a chance.

337
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:39,375
There's a lot of things to do.

338
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:44,413
Nobody in the world can lie on the ground
and not wrinkle. Look at this.

339
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:48,784
Not even one blade of grass.
Why don't I marry you, May?

340
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:50,978
Why don't you, Archie?

341
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:54,754
Tell me about Bobby Kennedy.

342
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,052
Picasso. Pickles?

343
00:33:58,228 --> 00:34:01,392
Talk about anything, any damn thing.
Take ice cubes.

344
00:34:01,632 --> 00:34:05,399
You can take either side.
Talk for 30 seconds against ice cubes.

345
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:07,902
Why the hostility, Archie?

346
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:12,336
That dress shop of yours.

347
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,102
Boutique.

348
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:17,012
All those rubber mannequins.

349
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:20,284
I've never once seen those pipes
that stick out of their bottoms.

350
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:23,353
Not one damn time.
That bothers me, May.

351
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:25,584
Yeah.

352
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:29,824
I'm not hostile. It's just frustration.

353
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,823
I mean, in all that perfection...

354
00:34:33,964 --> 00:34:37,025
...how is a clumsy clod like me
ever gonna be fitted in...

355
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:39,193
...without ruining the whole effect?

356
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,771
Don't worry about it.
You'll be going back to Polo.

357
00:34:41,939 --> 00:34:44,272
No, she's found a fella.

358
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:50,407
I'd just about given up on you, Archie.

359
00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:54,308
Why don't I marry you, May?

360
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,025
Look, Archie, if it will please you,
I will submit a list to you of my faults.

361
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:03,422
Some of which will probably
shake you up a bit.

362
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:06,587
- It would be a fake list.
- Probably.

363
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:08,790
No, it wouldn't be a fake list.

364
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:14,698
Actually, I wear arch supports.
My depilatory causes a nasty little rash.

365
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:19,742
And I've lost 10 percent of my hearing
in less than a year. Okay?

366
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,845
Okay.

367
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,768
Well, of all people.

368
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:56,175
All that crap about the humanitarianism
of the medical profession.

369
00:35:56,814 --> 00:35:59,079
- Mr. Howard. Mr. Howard!
- Don't ask.

370
00:35:59,249 --> 00:36:01,741
Come on. Come on.

371
00:36:02,152 --> 00:36:05,088
Archie, this is Mr. Howard.

372
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:07,224
I was looking at the foundations.

373
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:10,250
Once in a while, you'll find
one before the earthquake.

374
00:36:10,328 --> 00:36:11,750
It's a thrill, believe you me.

375
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:15,457
Mr. Howard is the watchman
for the Companions of the Evergreen.

376
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,692
- Or was.
- The tuba.

377
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:19,860
No wonder people are cynical
about doctors.

378
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:22,233
I tried to return the thing,
the place was locked.

379
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:24,773
- No harm done.
- I didn't expect this of you, Archie.

380
00:36:24,942 --> 00:36:27,776
Petulia, I tried to bring it back
Friday night.

381
00:36:27,945 --> 00:36:29,208
- It's okay.
- No.

382
00:36:29,379 --> 00:36:32,144
The Companions of the Evergreen
are proud of their brass band.

383
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:34,717
- All's well that ends well.
- You stay out of this.

384
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,645
I'm Petulia Danner. I'm sorry about this.

385
00:36:44,294 --> 00:36:48,527
She said this elderly lady's
first husband...

386
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:51,794
...played the tuba for John Philip Sousa.

387
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:54,230
She said it would cheer her up...

388
00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:56,873
...make her wanna live.

389
00:36:57,574 --> 00:37:00,840
Well, this is all right.
Well, she gave me 5 bucks.

390
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,843
All that broken glass.

391
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,240
Well, it's okay.

392
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:09,682
- Goodbye, Mr. Howard. Goodbye, Petulia.
- Mr. Howard, look....

393
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:14,081
You take a taxi.

394
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:22,191
- You might at least say sorry, Archie.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Howard. Goodbye, Petulia.

395
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:33,069
All right, Petulia, what happens next?

396
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:37,006
I'd like to discuss your irresponsibility.

397
00:37:39,116 --> 00:37:42,678
- Goodbye, Petulia.
- My rib.

398
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:48,155
I should explain about her.
She is a kook. We're going to be married.

399
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:52,786
Oh, Archie, when you try to sound cool
and with it, you're really pathetic.

400
00:37:53,263 --> 00:37:55,528
We're trying to have
an intelligent conversation.

401
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,395
About what?

402
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:00,536
Well, about Polo, for one thing.

403
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,902
- Polo is none of your damn business.
- Oh, that's dumb.

404
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:08,612
She's my business
and she's this lady's business.

405
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:10,179
I happen to hate Polo.

406
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:12,643
Needless to say,
she's never even met Polo.

407
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:15,581
I look at you and I know Polo.

408
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,684
Explain that to him.

409
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:24,291
How long were you married?
Eight, 10 years? Anyway, the best.

410
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:26,726
- Thrown away, down the drain.
- Oh, come on.

411
00:38:26,897 --> 00:38:29,594
Archie, listen.
We lead totally different lives.

412
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:33,066
We've got nothing to agree upon,
except for one thing:

413
00:38:33,236 --> 00:38:36,138
You're a lonely, screwed-up mess.
You're--

414
00:38:36,373 --> 00:38:39,537
I'm trying to save you, Archie.
You're a very, very special man.

415
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,269
Oh, God.

416
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:43,004
You tell him.

417
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:47,674
- You don't think so?
- Oh, I....

418
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:52,050
I won't put Archie on a pedestal. He'll....
He'll do.

419
00:38:52,422 --> 00:38:55,449
You've got yourself
another winner, Archie.

420
00:38:57,894 --> 00:39:00,955
It's a joke.
You're both putting me on.

421
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:03,129
Look, Petulia...

422
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:06,765
...tubas, all this <i>I Love Lucy</i> jazz,
it's only cute for a while.

423
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:09,202
It's not meant to be cute.

424
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,600
I'm fighting for your life.

425
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:16,077
Who is trying to kill me?

426
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:21,014
The 2.5 million subscribers
to the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>. Right, dear?

427
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:23,449
Look, Petulia, go home
and save what's-his-name.

428
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,748
I really don't wanna see you anymore.

429
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,472
Well...

430
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:46,109
...what's for dinner?

431
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:37,218
Hi.

432
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:42,494
Oh, you're kidding me.

433
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:45,726
I think I discovered a cure for cancer.

434
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,600
You're on the brink of something.
How did they let you in here?

435
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:53,801
- You look exhausted.
- Well, it's almost 3:00.

436
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:56,947
Or doesn't Mr. Danner worry
about things like that?

437
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,654
Look at you.

438
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:29,077
I'll drop you off.
It's too late for the bus.

439
00:41:37,187 --> 00:41:40,749
Petulia, you really have to stop
following me around like this.

440
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:57,632
All right. I could use a steak sandwich.
Maybe we can find someplace open.

441
00:41:58,675 --> 00:42:00,439
Archie.

442
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:18,155
Yes.

443
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,099
Not here.

444
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:47,086
I'm not really very hungry.

445
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,391
I'm starving.

446
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:51,321
Am I being punished?

447
00:42:51,494 --> 00:42:55,226
Loganberry jam. I think I'll take a case.

448
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:57,765
I'd rather have a plastic raincoat.

449
00:42:57,934 --> 00:43:00,369
You can't save on plastic raincoats.

450
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:02,699
Would you like me to get another cart?

451
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,237
Polo will fill three or four
when she puts her mind to it.

452
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:17,584
I brought it in with me.

453
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,819
- Need any help?
- Oh, yeah.

454
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,824
No, no, have some. I love you.

455
00:43:29,766 --> 00:43:32,668
You enjoy playing at poverty, don't you?

456
00:43:33,603 --> 00:43:37,472
Have some. All right, give me it back.
Come on. It's mine.

457
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:39,337
- This you pay for.
- Look, I brought--

458
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:41,712
Cut it out, stupid.
You're gonna pay for it!

459
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,416
You give me my sardines!

460
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:45,746
Come on, let's get out of here.

461
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,848
You know what time it is?
It's after 5:00.

462
00:43:49,653 --> 00:43:52,418
- I'm sorry.
- I wanna go to bed.

463
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,251
So do we.

464
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:02,664
Hey.

465
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:32,519
<i>I see.</i>

466
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:37,622
All right. Let's run some slides anyway.

467
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:41,524
To satisfy me, that's who.

468
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:43,524
Okay?

469
00:45:53,143 --> 00:45:54,668
Well...

470
00:45:55,278 --> 00:45:56,974
...we knocked off another one.

471
00:45:57,147 --> 00:46:02,313
- One more notch in the old stethoscope.
- You're a wonderful doctor.

472
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,516
I keep a little black bow tie
in my desk drawer...

473
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,320
...in case the services are in the morning
and I can't get home.

474
00:46:11,494 --> 00:46:13,520
The neckband is all stained with sweat.

475
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:15,241
Why are you dressed?

476
00:46:15,414 --> 00:46:18,298
I gotta pick up the kids.
I'm late already.

477
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:23,636
You're not abandoning me?
I mean, I wasn't all that bad, was I?

478
00:46:24,374 --> 00:46:26,138
Amateur night.

479
00:46:30,713 --> 00:46:32,944
Without cleaning my teeth.

480
00:46:33,316 --> 00:46:35,945
- You a communist, Archie?
- I hope so.

481
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,350
Tell Mike to watch his weight.

482
00:46:45,195 --> 00:46:46,527
Yes?

483
00:46:49,399 --> 00:46:51,231
I'm divorcing David,
if that's what you mean.

484
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:53,529
No, it's none of my business.

485
00:46:54,671 --> 00:46:56,640
- Phone me.
- Where?

486
00:46:56,806 --> 00:46:58,172
Here.

487
00:46:58,341 --> 00:47:00,674
Write down the number
so you don't forget.

488
00:47:31,007 --> 00:47:32,771
Hey, you wanna buy these, lady?

489
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:34,570
- Come on, they're cheap.
- No.

490
00:47:34,744 --> 00:47:37,339
- Buy mine, please.
- No, <i>gracias.</i>

491
00:47:37,514 --> 00:47:39,415
Go on. Push off.

492
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:43,043
- Come on, lady. Please buy these.
- No!

493
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:46,084
Get away, will you? Get away!

494
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:51,989
<i>The Department of Immigration welcomes
you to the United States of America.</i>

495
00:47:52,762 --> 00:47:54,060
Buy these, lady.

496
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,436
<i>Well, yes, I have been waiting for you
to phone.</i>

497
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:04,731
<i>Still, I got in a bit of decorating.
Your bedroom's mauve now.</i>

498
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,004
<i>You left without having any breakfast.</i>

499
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:11,144
- It's about time--
- All right. Shut up, you guys.

500
00:48:11,314 --> 00:48:13,408
- Come on. Come on!
- Don't keep pounding.

501
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:14,583
<i>- Who's that?</i>
- Mike.

502
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:17,448
- Fat Mike.
<i>- Oh, he's not all that thin.</i>

503
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,299
<i>You shouldn't have left
without breakfast.</i>

504
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:20,536
I had a cup of coffee.

505
00:48:21,824 --> 00:48:24,259
<i>- Well, goodbye, Petulia.</i>
- Archie?

506
00:48:24,627 --> 00:48:27,859
- Yes?
<i>- Don't forget to phone.</i>

507
00:48:29,732 --> 00:48:33,362
<i>That's a relaxing cruise about to leave.</i>

508
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,806
<i>Wonderful view of the bay,
Golden Gate Bridge...</i>

509
00:48:36,973 --> 00:48:40,273
<i>...Alcatraz and the city skyline.</i>

510
00:48:42,078 --> 00:48:45,537
They used to think that prison
was impossible to escape from.

511
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:48,810
They used to think that prison
was impossible to escape from.

512
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:51,580
Yes, Dad. Warren told us that
last week.

513
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:53,222
Warren?

514
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:56,052
We could have gone someplace else.
I didn't know you'd been.

515
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:58,354
We thought you'd never been, Dad.

516
00:48:58,528 --> 00:49:01,225
Thanks. Actually, I haven't been, Stevie.

517
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:04,492
- In fact, we don't call him Stevie anymore.
- Who doesn't?

518
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:07,432
Mom thinks he's getting a little old
for being called Stevie.

519
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:10,597
- Like one of those radios?
- I called you Stevie two weeks ago.

520
00:49:10,773 --> 00:49:13,106
We were all calling you Stevie
two weeks ago. I was.

521
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:14,505
Before that.

522
00:49:14,677 --> 00:49:17,806
Warren says Alcatraz taught the world
you can get out of anything...

523
00:49:17,981 --> 00:49:20,041
- ...if you want to bad enough.
- Does it?

524
00:49:20,216 --> 00:49:23,277
- Warren does, does he?
- Yes, Dad.

525
00:49:27,523 --> 00:49:28,957
I think I just got a hernia.

526
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:33,961
Are you sure I can't tempt you, lady?
No? Shrimp cocktail.

527
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,656
Don't touch that.

528
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,995
<i>Oh, but watch it. Because the kids can
get sunburned if they're fair-skinned.</i>

529
00:49:58,187 --> 00:50:00,053
Hey, what's this?

530
00:50:07,563 --> 00:50:09,122
Oh, but--

531
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:26,707
Come on, scram.

532
00:50:27,784 --> 00:50:30,219
Get back over there where you belong.

533
00:50:30,787 --> 00:50:35,054
Get out. I don't want you here.
Joke's over, you won.

534
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:40,795
Okay.

535
00:50:45,435 --> 00:50:47,301
Warren ever bring you here?

536
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,961
- No!
- No!

537
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:51,735
He would have seen the sign.

538
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:55,274
Hey, this is great, Dad.
Come on up.

539
00:50:55,645 --> 00:50:57,580
Come on!

540
00:50:57,914 --> 00:51:01,851
Come on up, Dad. I'll race you down.

541
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:19,296
Dad, where are you?

542
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:21,404
Hey, Dad!

543
00:51:21,571 --> 00:51:23,767
Dad!

544
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:31,815
Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

545
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:34,007
Come on. Just stop.

546
00:51:34,183 --> 00:51:36,948
- Hey, this is great.
- All right.

547
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,555
Hey, 10 minutes to 2.

548
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,851
Just imagine how the time went.
I'm bushed.

549
00:51:43,025 --> 00:51:45,290
- I feel okay.
- I've been sneezing.

550
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:47,896
- Yeah, I noticed.
- He's always sneezing.

551
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:50,966
Listen, next week, I want you guys
for the whole week.

552
00:51:51,134 --> 00:51:53,535
- None of this three- or four-hour stuff.
- All weekend?

553
00:51:53,703 --> 00:51:56,263
- Why not?
- To do what?

554
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:58,670
- Just you wait.
- Something really interesting?

555
00:51:58,841 --> 00:52:00,332
- Bet your life.
- What?

556
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:04,675
- Leave it to me.
- Warren said something about a roller derby.

557
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:08,373
- The roller derby's pretty darn interesting.
- Yeah.

558
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:11,652
We'd have to sleep over
if we're gonna spend the whole weekend.

559
00:52:11,821 --> 00:52:14,723
- I want you to.
- Well, it's fine by me.

560
00:52:14,891 --> 00:52:18,589
- Me too.
- Okay, good. It's a deal.

561
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,423
You've got
a very nice handshake, Dad.

562
00:52:28,738 --> 00:52:32,675
<i>--thrown out by Charlie before our big guns
were able to pinpoint and silence him.</i>

563
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:38,213
<i>In ground skirmishes later the same day,
42 VC were killed by the same 4th Battalion.</i>

564
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:42,748
<i>The Marines moved up during the night,
and with chopper support...</i>

565
00:52:42,919 --> 00:52:45,150
<i>- ...attacked the Vietcong stronghold...</i>
- Petulia?

566
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:46,880
<i>...with napalm and rocket weaponry.</i>

567
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:50,617
<i>Our cameraman was in the third chopper
and was involved in the antiaircraft....</i>

568
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,261
Nice, neat kid.

569
00:52:52,428 --> 00:52:55,626
<i>--before our big guns
were able to pinpoint and silence him.</i>

570
00:52:55,865 --> 00:52:57,800
<i>In ground skirmishes--</i>

571
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:29,588
Come on, come on! Come on!

572
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:07,395
All right, drop your left. That's right.
Now swing on around. Good.

573
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:11,166
Now, there are 12 stairs down. Easy.

574
00:54:11,974 --> 00:54:16,309
All right, watch it. Be careful, now.
Watch your balance.

575
00:54:16,512 --> 00:54:18,447
- One more.
- Oh, Harry. Come and look.

576
00:54:18,614 --> 00:54:21,709
Now you get the-- Now swing left.

577
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:24,047
Now come-- That's right. Right.

578
00:54:24,487 --> 00:54:28,117
And drop that. Yeah, good.
Watch your head.

579
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:30,453
- What's going on?
- Get those people behind....

580
00:54:30,626 --> 00:54:32,026
It could be a gas leak.

581
00:54:32,194 --> 00:54:35,995
- She's dead.
- Up on-- Back on away.

582
00:54:36,265 --> 00:54:38,325
Watch that dog. Get out of here.

583
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:40,800
- That's sex for you.
- It could happen to you.

584
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,734
- Those cops never give up.
- All right.

585
00:54:43,673 --> 00:54:45,403
I had the same trouble with a piano.

586
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:48,636
Two hundred dollars to get it through
the window, hasn't been the same since.

587
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:51,144
Come on. Get out of the way.
Give us a little room.

588
00:54:51,314 --> 00:54:54,079
- I'm gonna be sick. Is she alive?
- They went in a while ago.

589
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,014
He's got blood on his collar.

590
00:54:57,353 --> 00:54:59,913
She'll have a heck of a time washing
the blood out of her hair.

591
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:01,489
- Bye.
- Write if you get work.

592
00:55:01,657 --> 00:55:03,853
Oh, I wish my husband was home.

593
00:55:04,026 --> 00:55:05,585
- Why?
- He always--

594
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,559
Now, let's go.

595
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,315
Say hello to Petulia's folly.

596
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:40,963
In the past, you thought me a bit odd.
Just feast your eyes on this little goody.

597
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,723
What's the problem?

598
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:51,074
Why don't you speak English? Why the hell
don't they teach them to speak English?

599
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:54,602
This little hustler, believe it or not,
picked me up in Tijuana.

600
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:57,058
- What's your name?
- I can think of a name for him.

601
00:55:57,097 --> 00:56:01,384
Lady say, "Hey, come on,
let's go San Francisco, 10 bucks."

602
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,611
You bleeding little liar.

603
00:56:04,787 --> 00:56:09,088
I never did. I may have said,
"Maybe, if we come back to Tijuana--"

604
00:56:09,258 --> 00:56:11,625
- San Francisco, huh?
- San Francisco.

605
00:56:11,794 --> 00:56:14,491
- San Francisco.
- San Francisco.

606
00:56:14,664 --> 00:56:16,997
- Okay, San Francisco.
- San Francisco.

607
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:20,500
- David, David, David.
- What's your name?

608
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:23,763
- Oliver.
- Oliver.

609
00:56:23,939 --> 00:56:25,498
Oliver.

610
00:56:26,442 --> 00:56:28,968
Listen. Listen, listen, listen, David.

611
00:56:29,145 --> 00:56:32,274
The San Diego bus leaves at 12:15,
I've already got him a ticket.

612
00:56:32,448 --> 00:56:36,317
We gotta get this on tape. He's really
something else. I get a big kick out of him.

613
00:56:36,485 --> 00:56:39,478
San Francisco. Unless he's a midget.

614
00:56:39,655 --> 00:56:44,184
- That's it. Oliver is a 63-year-old midget.
- David, David--

615
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,330
Come on. Get in. We got a long way to go.
We'll never get home.

616
00:56:47,496 --> 00:56:49,226
Okay. Okay.

617
00:56:49,999 --> 00:56:52,594
I'll take him to the cashier,
he'll see he gets on the bus.

618
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:54,828
But you promised Oliver San Francisco.

619
00:56:55,004 --> 00:56:58,031
- I did not.
- Like hell you didn't.

620
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:02,235
I dig, bitch. I dig.

621
00:57:02,778 --> 00:57:05,338
- I dig. Get in!
- David!

622
00:57:11,587 --> 00:57:16,048
Oh, it's almost 5:30.
My feet are killing me.

623
00:57:17,026 --> 00:57:19,928
- I'm gonna need another one here.
- Okay.

624
00:57:21,097 --> 00:57:25,398
- These cork floors get your feet too?
- Yeah, you know it.

625
00:57:28,104 --> 00:57:29,834
I thought they were gonna change them.

626
00:57:30,005 --> 00:57:33,567
- Yes, but it's the same every time.
- Come on, come on, come on.

627
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,880
Sorry.

628
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:41,579
There it is.

629
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:53,990
Hey, you.

630
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:58,397
You know there's a policeman outside
waiting to talk to you?

631
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:03,503
What the hell is going on?

632
00:58:06,675 --> 00:58:08,871
Can you have dinner with us tonight?

633
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:31,863
Isn't that the greatest lens
you ever saw, Archie?

634
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:35,232
Boy, you gotta admit, those Japs
really know how to grind a lens.

635
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,233
Well, what am I supposed to do?

636
00:58:41,076 --> 00:58:43,636
Spend the money on belly dancers?

637
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:46,413
Ask me what your daughter put in
her steam inhalator.

638
00:58:46,582 --> 00:58:50,451
- I don't wanna know.
- Ask me. Cottage cheese.

639
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:52,485
Actually, I'm relieved.

640
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:55,420
I'm afraid she's madly in love
with your little Stevie.

641
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:57,253
Steven.

642
00:58:57,893 --> 00:58:59,156
No?

643
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:07,028
Wasn't that a gorgeous weekend?
I just adore Big Sur.

644
00:59:07,203 --> 00:59:11,265
It rained every day.
She kept insisting she was pregnant.

645
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,000
You really must take Polo
and the boys and--

646
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:17,439
Wilma the magic talking machine.

647
00:59:17,613 --> 00:59:20,014
Put a dime in and she talks all night.

648
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,242
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

649
00:59:22,418 --> 00:59:26,480
I just can't think of you
without thinking of Polo.

650
00:59:28,424 --> 00:59:29,892
You sure?

651
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,256
Yeah, she made me run a frog test
on her.

652
00:59:33,662 --> 00:59:36,131
Had to go 40 miles in the rain.
Almost hit a truck.

653
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:38,790
Could be dead and buried three years ago.

654
00:59:39,301 --> 00:59:41,270
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

655
00:59:41,437 --> 00:59:43,406
I'll bet he's sorry.

656
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:46,167
Well, nothing wrong
with a little old-fashioned nostalgia.

657
00:59:46,909 --> 00:59:50,869
Hey, you remember that crazy Labor Day
weekend we all drove down to Tahoe?

658
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,379
Oh, yeah. I've got those
on the end of this magazine.

659
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:55,609
They just happen to be here.

660
00:59:55,951 --> 00:59:59,581
- What do you think this is, a conspiracy?
- Yes.

661
01:00:01,523 --> 01:00:03,651
Let's see them, Archie, huh?

662
01:00:10,432 --> 01:00:12,424
You go this time.

663
01:00:14,536 --> 01:00:16,698
What do you want me to say, Wilma...

664
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:19,405
...that those were great old times?

665
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,510
Archie.

666
01:00:26,715 --> 01:00:28,547
What's happening to you?

667
01:00:28,717 --> 01:00:30,811
- Nothing.
- Don't say "nothing."

668
01:00:31,854 --> 01:00:34,323
The policeman even called here.

669
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,015
I'm sorry.

670
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,395
Splitting earache all day.

671
01:00:41,664 --> 01:00:45,658
Friends have certain rights,
even the right to be obnoxious.

672
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:49,167
Do you...

673
01:00:50,072 --> 01:00:52,337
...love this woman?

674
01:00:53,642 --> 01:00:55,201
Well, you must...

675
01:00:56,045 --> 01:00:57,946
...feel something.

676
01:00:58,981 --> 01:01:00,745
Yeah, I guess I do.

677
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:03,579
- Pity.
- Pity?

678
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:08,724
Go to the dog pound.

679
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,526
You'll find 200 dogs
waiting to be gassed.

680
01:01:15,931 --> 01:01:18,025
Shall I tell you something?

681
01:01:19,935 --> 01:01:21,528
I wish I had your guts.

682
01:01:32,581 --> 01:01:36,848
Who would do such a thing
to a girl like this? She's a child.

683
01:01:38,988 --> 01:01:42,254
Is there an orthopedic problem,
Dr. Bollen?

684
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:45,988
A doctor should get his sleep.

685
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:47,993
You left the needle in.

686
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,428
- From the archbishop's fund.
- Take it out.

687
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:53,034
All races and creeds.

688
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:57,097
- Why hasn't her husband been notified?
- I suppose they've tried.

689
01:01:57,272 --> 01:02:00,367
It would be a nice surprise to have
his picture here when she awakens.

690
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:02,408
- Wouldn't that be nice?
- Yes.

691
01:02:02,644 --> 01:02:05,273
It would give her some small comfort.

692
01:02:07,316 --> 01:02:10,878
I.... I put a little tape
around the needle for you.

693
01:02:11,053 --> 01:02:15,923
I mentioned her this morning
in the chapel. I mention all my criticals.

694
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,592
Next time, be more careful.

695
01:02:22,631 --> 01:02:25,157
Doctor. Doctor, doctor.

696
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:29,101
Can you--? Can you make
the television work, please?

697
01:02:29,571 --> 01:02:35,033
Oh, yes. Well, I think....
This is not a real television set, ma'am.

698
01:02:35,444 --> 01:02:37,470
- You mean it's a dummy?
- Yes.

699
01:02:37,646 --> 01:02:40,278
It seems a little silly, I know.
But it's....

700
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,440
Well, the hospital
feels that if....

701
01:02:42,518 --> 01:02:44,282
Why don't you.... Excuse me.

702
01:02:44,483 --> 01:02:46,685
It is a hospital policy.

703
01:02:46,734 --> 01:02:49,916
We have a concession that brings
in the dummy television sets...

704
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:54,053
...and then you can order one
if you like it. You don't understand.

705
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,960
Doctor? Come here a minute.
Thank you.

706
01:02:57,132 --> 01:03:00,068
Could you explain to her
why we have the dummy television sets?

707
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,466
We have a dummy television set
in each room...

708
01:03:02,638 --> 01:03:06,575
...to encourage you to want to have
a real one. Would you like a real one?

709
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:09,371
- No.
- All right.

710
01:03:10,712 --> 01:03:14,672
Dr. Bollen. Hi, Fred Six. I wonder
if I could-- If you have a moment...

711
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:18,378
...I'd like to show you the Stryker
flotation pads for prevention of bedsores.

712
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:20,386
Here I have a raw egg. It's a raw egg.

713
01:03:20,556 --> 01:03:23,458
I wonder if you'd oblige me
by sitting down on that egg.

714
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:27,084
You might be surprised that I asked you--
Here, I'll do it for you.

715
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:30,494
You see, that's a raw egg.
I'm gonna sit right down on that egg.

716
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:35,866
Now, this is a very expensive
composition, doctor. Now, you realize--

717
01:03:36,038 --> 01:03:39,372
<i>Paging Mr. Webb.
Would you please report to the PR office...</i>

718
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:42,067
<i>- ...on the second floor for the film unit.</i>
- Oliver.

719
01:03:42,244 --> 01:03:46,944
<i>Paging Mr. Webb.
Second floor, film unit, PR office.</i>

720
01:03:47,816 --> 01:03:49,785
Come on, come on. Let's get on with it.

721
01:03:50,486 --> 01:03:53,183
<i>- I dig, bitch. I dig!
- David!</i>

722
01:03:53,355 --> 01:03:56,018
<i>- Get that kid out of here! Get him out!
- No!</i>

723
01:03:56,425 --> 01:03:58,326
- He's not mine!
- David, he's going!

724
01:03:58,494 --> 01:04:00,725
- That's why you brought him here.
- He's going.

725
01:04:00,896 --> 01:04:03,024
Oliver, come on.

726
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:10,833
Hey, San Francisco.
I sure hope there are no hard feelings.

727
01:04:12,074 --> 01:04:16,409
It isn't a question of hospitality.
I want you to understand that.

728
01:04:19,715 --> 01:04:21,308
I feel terrible.

729
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:25,477
Dragging you up to San Francisco and
not even showing you Fisherman's Wharf.

730
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:28,755
Hey, hold it a minute.

731
01:04:28,924 --> 01:04:30,517
What's the rush?

732
01:04:33,262 --> 01:04:36,664
Hey, you gotta have some little
memento, right?

733
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:40,325
- David, for God's sake.
- You see, Oliver, the basic problem is...

734
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:43,961
...we don't have the room for all the folks
my old lady invites for a visit.

735
01:04:44,139 --> 01:04:45,869
We're kind of short of room.

736
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:47,805
I'd give you the shirt off my back...

737
01:04:47,976 --> 01:04:50,639
...but you start loading the house
with make-believe kids...

738
01:04:50,812 --> 01:04:53,577
...plus every Tom, Dick and Harry
whose only claim to fame...

739
01:04:53,749 --> 01:04:55,047
...is he knows how to do it--

740
01:04:57,619 --> 01:05:00,612
It won't fit anywhere.

741
01:05:01,757 --> 01:05:04,625
Hey, I don't want any hard feelings, huh?

742
01:05:05,961 --> 01:05:08,021
It was nothing personal.

743
01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:15,300
Hey, we'll look you up sometime, huh?
When we're down that way.

744
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,200
- We'll have a real fiesta.
- Give me.

745
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:21,041
- We'll have a ball.
- Give it back to me.

746
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,473
- Oliver.
- He give me!

747
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:25,576
- Oliver!
- Oliver, please--

748
01:05:26,348 --> 01:05:27,509
Oliver!

749
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:32,815
Get on.

750
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:47,428
- How's your patient?
- Oh, Mrs. Danner?

751
01:05:47,603 --> 01:05:51,472
- Yes, Mrs. Danner. How is Mrs. Danner?
- She woke up a while ago.

752
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,404
- She woke up?
- Should I have called you?

753
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:58,036
She's asleep now. I'm to buy her
blue cornflowers and a hairbrush.

754
01:05:58,213 --> 01:06:03,277
Sister Teresa phoned the police.
Prayers do help, Dr. Bollen.

755
01:06:03,452 --> 01:06:07,583
I'm also supposed to go across town and
deliver a message to the Mendoza family.

756
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:10,817
I'm to tell them everything is okay
and give them this.

757
01:06:10,993 --> 01:06:12,586
Let me.

758
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,229
Thank you.

759
01:07:20,095 --> 01:07:21,688
Hello?

760
01:07:23,398 --> 01:07:24,957
Mr. Mendoza?

761
01:07:25,133 --> 01:07:26,999
Mr. Mendoza?

762
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:30,765
I'm Dr. Bollen. Do you know
a woman named Danner?

763
01:07:30,939 --> 01:07:32,237
Petulia Danner?

764
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:35,807
No, wait. She gave me this address.

765
01:07:35,977 --> 01:07:39,539
She's been beaten almost to death.
You are Mr. Mendoza, aren't you?

766
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:43,017
Mendoza.

767
01:07:44,586 --> 01:07:46,282
Well, this is for you.

768
01:07:58,433 --> 01:08:01,028
Hey, no, wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you. Hey!

769
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,762
Wait just-- Wait just a second.

770
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,304
Yeah, but I wanna--

771
01:08:07,476 --> 01:08:09,843
Hey, I wanna speak to you a minute! Hey!

772
01:08:16,852 --> 01:08:20,619
Hey, either of you fellas speak Spanish?

773
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:26,227
Well, I speak a little bit of Polish, if that
would be any kind of help to you, sir.

774
01:08:26,395 --> 01:08:30,526
Yeah, well, I gotta talk to this man in here.
A woman's been beaten almost to death.

775
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:32,429
- Here?
- No. Not in here. No.

776
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:36,936
- You said here, man.
- You said beaten to death, but not quite?

777
01:08:37,105 --> 01:08:40,007
- Yeah.
- Here, but not quite here, is that it?

778
01:08:40,175 --> 01:08:42,235
- Just call a cop for me.
- I'd rather not.

779
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:46,576
Well, he'd better speak a lot of Polish, man,
because I'm on a fantastic Polish trip.

780
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:51,410
Crazy man wants to go to police.

781
01:08:54,055 --> 01:08:59,858
<i>Sixty-five, 4-2 William Lincoln Adam
1-9-0-3-5....</i>

782
01:09:19,748 --> 01:09:22,308
Why weren't you here when I woke up?

783
01:09:22,717 --> 01:09:26,119
Better not say you were
when the bill comes, Dr. Bollen.

784
01:09:26,888 --> 01:09:28,254
Who is this guy Mendoza?

785
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:32,022
- I'm a very sick girl.
- Who beat you up?

786
01:09:33,028 --> 01:09:35,793
- What happened to your hand?
- Nothing to my hand.

787
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:43,771
I love your hand. I'd like
plaster of Paris molds for bookcases.

788
01:09:43,939 --> 01:09:45,407
Bookends.

789
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,945
Did David beat you up?

790
01:09:51,713 --> 01:09:54,239
Was it Mendoza?
Why were you sending him money?

791
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:56,408
- I'm still very sick.
- I don't care.

792
01:09:56,785 --> 01:10:01,120
- This man is a doctor?
- The best in the world, madam.

793
01:10:01,623 --> 01:10:03,956
Petulia, you're turning into something...

794
01:10:04,526 --> 01:10:08,930
- ...crazy. Why isn't David here?
- Don't ask questions.

795
01:10:09,097 --> 01:10:12,295
Is it possible for you
to ever tell the truth?

796
01:10:20,809 --> 01:10:23,574
Mrs. Mendoza
was looking after Oliver for me.

797
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:27,078
There was no Mrs. Mendoza.

798
01:10:27,649 --> 01:10:29,743
I had to have someplace for him to stay.

799
01:10:30,819 --> 01:10:33,254
David would never let me
bring him home.

800
01:10:34,456 --> 01:10:36,391
Bring who home?

801
01:10:37,826 --> 01:10:40,421
Oh, I really am very sleepy.

802
01:11:04,753 --> 01:11:06,278
Shouldn't we police the area?

803
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:11,025
Shouldn't we police the area?

804
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:14,119
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Police the area.

805
01:11:14,296 --> 01:11:17,164
This is keen, Dad.
Water canteens and everything.

806
01:11:17,332 --> 01:11:20,393
- I'm out of water.
- I'll get some down at the old water hole.

807
01:11:20,569 --> 01:11:22,538
- What's on the TV?
- I'm hot.

808
01:11:22,704 --> 01:11:24,639
Well, switch off the fire.

809
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:28,502
It really is keen, Dad.

810
01:11:37,552 --> 01:11:41,580
- Well, I don't believe it.
- Even canteens, Mom.

811
01:11:46,494 --> 01:11:48,986
We have to hurry.
The roller derby starts at 8.

812
01:11:49,164 --> 01:11:52,259
It's been really keen, Mom.
Nobody's ever heard of a camp-in.

813
01:11:53,535 --> 01:11:55,629
It's been really keen, Mom.

814
01:11:56,638 --> 01:11:57,901
Poor Archie.

815
01:11:58,073 --> 01:12:00,668
Not "dumb Archie"?

816
01:12:00,909 --> 01:12:02,400
No.

817
01:12:02,577 --> 01:12:04,443
The brightest.

818
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:11,352
You know, I used to have such a terrible
anxiety that I would die suddenly...

819
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:14,546
...and I would never have a chance
to say thank you.

820
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:21,391
Is Dad allowed to come to the roller derby,
since Uncle Warren couldn't?

821
01:12:28,637 --> 01:12:30,299
I guess he can.

822
01:13:14,783 --> 01:13:18,185
- Don't let that fat butt get away with that!
- Oh, Michael.

823
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:19,384
Fat butt!

824
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:21,986
Please tell your son
he can't talk like that.

825
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,898
- I wanna go home.
- They don't mean it. It's fake.

826
01:13:32,067 --> 01:13:35,367
- I want some popcorn.
- I'll get it for you.

827
01:13:47,248 --> 01:13:49,945
Calling about Petulia--
It's very noisy.

828
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:10,963
Here.

829
01:14:15,343 --> 01:14:16,971
I said, popcorn.

830
01:14:17,145 --> 01:14:21,913
- Shut up and eat your Cracker Jacks.
- How is she? Dead, I hope.

831
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,386
- You haven't even met her.
- I just have to look at you.

832
01:14:28,123 --> 01:14:30,456
And she isn't going to die.

833
01:14:31,726 --> 01:14:35,822
She just had her first visitor.
Mr. Danner.

834
01:14:37,565 --> 01:14:40,467
"His master's in hydraulics."

835
01:14:48,843 --> 01:14:52,541
It's been a terrible shock
to Mother and me.

836
01:14:52,714 --> 01:14:56,742
Our sailor boy and his pretty bride.

837
01:14:57,485 --> 01:15:00,045
As I said to Mother:

838
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:04,682
"The values we live by just don't seem
to amount to anything at all anymore.

839
01:15:04,859 --> 01:15:09,957
Our kids can chuck out 2000 years
of Western civilization, of Christianity...

840
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:14,501
...just as though
it wasn't worth a red cent."

841
01:15:16,571 --> 01:15:20,030
Mother's reply, a surprise.

842
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,200
Well, it really sort of tickled me:

843
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:25,844
<i>"It's easy to be an angel
when you're old and all worn out...</i>

844
01:15:26,014 --> 01:15:27,482
<i>...and nobody wants you anymore."</i>

845
01:15:28,416 --> 01:15:32,547
You see, Petulia, we do try.

846
01:15:33,121 --> 01:15:35,056
I mean....

847
01:15:35,657 --> 01:15:39,025
Well, there you were
in that man's apartment.

848
01:15:41,029 --> 01:15:43,362
Where I come from...

849
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:47,560
...in little pockets of ignorance,
I suppose you'd call it...

850
01:15:48,469 --> 01:15:52,463
...there are still plenty of people
who live by the unwritten law.

851
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:56,871
There's many a county courthouse...

852
01:15:57,045 --> 01:16:01,346
...where the husband could kill both parties
and never spend one night in jail.

853
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,657
In my hospital, they won't
send people out like sheep.

854
01:16:10,825 --> 01:16:15,889
People are better than most medicines
they give you.

855
01:16:20,768 --> 01:16:23,294
David's finally getting around
to repairing that wharf.

856
01:16:23,605 --> 01:16:24,937
<i>He's hired a couple of boys.</i>

857
01:16:25,106 --> 01:16:27,541
<i>The three of them
are really working up a sweat.</i>

858
01:16:27,942 --> 01:16:31,344
<i>He's thinking of sailing all the way
down the coast to Lima, Peru.</i>

859
01:16:32,146 --> 01:16:35,674
They say Lima is a terrific city
if you watch out for the flies...

860
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:39,048
...and take sensible sanitary precautions.

861
01:16:40,021 --> 01:16:42,889
I'll tell you a secret
if you promise not to snitch.

862
01:16:43,424 --> 01:16:46,155
I'm using propaganda on David...

863
01:16:46,327 --> 01:16:48,990
...so the four of us can go.

864
01:16:50,865 --> 01:16:54,427
Mother's a better sailor than I am, though
I spent 18 months on a minesweeper...

865
01:16:54,602 --> 01:16:57,128
...and that should have prepared me
for almost anything.

866
01:16:58,072 --> 01:16:59,165
Visiting hours are over.

867
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,809
I had lunch with your Mr. Pearl
just two weeks ago.

868
01:17:02,944 --> 01:17:07,541
Mr. Pearl happens to be
the superintendent of this hospital.

869
01:17:07,815 --> 01:17:12,219
Two weeks ago at the Blue Fox.
Just the six of us.

870
01:17:21,529 --> 01:17:25,261
David and I went at it hot and heavy
on the value of psychiatry....

871
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:27,902
Oliver!

872
01:17:42,216 --> 01:17:44,082
Pull it back, pull it off him.

873
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:51,217
- He just ran in front of it.
- Where's his mother?

874
01:17:51,693 --> 01:17:54,094
- He just ran out there.
<i>- Mother picked the place.</i>

875
01:17:54,429 --> 01:17:57,024
<i>Another visit to the woodshed
and a whack on the backside.</i>

876
01:17:57,832 --> 01:18:01,428
But it's late
in the old ball game for that.

877
01:18:01,602 --> 01:18:04,470
I'm sorry, sir, but it's time
for the lady's medication.

878
01:18:05,506 --> 01:18:07,202
Doesn't--?

879
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:10,641
Doesn't anyone ever report
how filthy this room is?

880
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:12,713
Look at that. Filthy.

881
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,577
Look at that. Look at it. Filthy.

882
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:19,517
I personally raised $50,000
for this hospital during the last campaign.

883
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:23,124
You didn't know that, did you?
Well, ask your Mr. Pearl.

884
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:27,353
That is, if you know what he looks like.
Filthy! Filthy! Filthy!

885
01:18:35,903 --> 01:18:38,202
You can tell David it's all right.

886
01:18:38,773 --> 01:18:40,674
He can come out of the cupboard.

887
01:18:46,614 --> 01:18:48,412
Chin up.

888
01:18:55,957 --> 01:19:00,986
<i>I've just caught the most extraordinary,
fantastic man there ever was.</i>

889
01:19:01,162 --> 01:19:05,827
<i>Hey, don't tell me that.
I'll never be able to compete with myself.</i>

890
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:10,737
<i>Stat call. Stat call, Dr. Marsh.</i>

891
01:19:10,905 --> 01:19:13,272
<i>Stat call, Dr. Marsh.</i>

892
01:19:13,574 --> 01:19:18,137
<i>Dr. Feinberg. Dr. Feinberg.
Can you please move your car?</i>

893
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:22,617
I'm not sick. Don't waste time on me.

894
01:19:22,784 --> 01:19:25,379
- Where is she?
- Mrs. Danner? They picked her up.

895
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,890
The doctor said it was all right
so long as she had proper nursing.

896
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:31,390
- Who picked her up?
- Her husband, I suppose.

897
01:19:31,859 --> 01:19:34,419
They had a long talk with the doctor.
He seemed satisfied.

898
01:19:34,595 --> 01:19:36,894
Take care of the sick people.
I'm in tiptop shape.

899
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:10,826
Hi, Archie.

900
01:20:10,998 --> 01:20:15,800
This is Dr. Bollen of the hospital.
He's a splendid doctor.

901
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:20,066
- This is Agnes Lillywhite.
- Our young lady is doing nicely.

902
01:20:20,241 --> 01:20:22,938
We have a few problems,
but nothing serious.

903
01:20:23,111 --> 01:20:24,909
I get hiccups.

904
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:27,771
I just keep hiccupping along
merrily for hours.

905
01:20:27,982 --> 01:20:30,315
Why did you leave the hospital?

906
01:20:31,152 --> 01:20:34,247
I felt ever so much better, Archie.

907
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:39,018
Oh, hello. Are you staying for lunch?
We've plenty of cracked crab.

908
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:44,330
You two haven't met. This is Dr. Bollen.

909
01:20:44,499 --> 01:20:46,695
Yes, I thought so. Hello there.

910
01:20:46,868 --> 01:20:50,737
- I want you to go back to the hospital.
- Dr. Worthington says she's doing fine.

911
01:20:50,905 --> 01:20:54,865
- He's gonna make daily house calls.
- Yes. He's very nice.

912
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:56,271
Petulia--

913
01:20:57,211 --> 01:20:59,806
Well, now you've finally met
our whole family.

914
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:03,247
Dr. Bollen, this isn't exactly
what I'd call good taste.

915
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:05,045
Not to mention medical ethics.

916
01:21:05,286 --> 01:21:07,949
Hey, come on, Dad, you old fuddy-duddy.
Things happen.

917
01:21:08,122 --> 01:21:10,489
You told the policeman
you had a dizzy spell?

918
01:21:11,192 --> 01:21:13,627
Right. I fell on my bottom.

919
01:21:13,794 --> 01:21:17,060
- You were somebody's punching bag.
- I won't have you cross-examine her.

920
01:21:17,231 --> 01:21:21,498
- Your son almost killed her.
- Hey, doc, I'll sit still for only so much.

921
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:24,468
I want you to remember everything
this man said.

922
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:28,576
And, though it's none of your business...

923
01:21:28,743 --> 01:21:32,145
...my boy was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

924
01:21:32,446 --> 01:21:33,744
Looking at boats.

925
01:21:34,715 --> 01:21:37,742
We've decided we're quite happy
with the one we have.

926
01:21:40,254 --> 01:21:42,689
When Dad called,
I was having dinner with some cousins.

927
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:47,424
Good, mouth-watering,
old-fashioned Creole cooking.

928
01:21:48,296 --> 01:21:51,596
I'm all right, Archie. I just burp a lot.

929
01:21:51,766 --> 01:21:54,361
Everybody gets dizzy spells.

930
01:22:39,814 --> 01:22:41,544
Archie.

931
01:22:42,316 --> 01:22:45,343
<i>Well, that's over.</i>

932
01:22:45,886 --> 01:22:47,184
<i>Yes.</i>

933
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,663
<i>I'd have turned
those beautiful hands into fists.</i>

934
01:22:57,265 --> 01:22:59,393
<i>Stop it, Petulia.</i>

935
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:02,068
<i>David.</i>

936
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:05,863
<i>You were the gentlest man I ever knew.</i>

937
01:24:20,247 --> 01:24:23,581
Fourteen B, take one.
Camera, roll it.

938
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,911
- Okay, camera rolling.
- Bill, hold the pack up.

939
01:24:26,187 --> 01:24:28,053
No, put your finger
over that "cancer" bit.

940
01:24:28,222 --> 01:24:30,248
- Got it.
- Fine.

941
01:24:30,424 --> 01:24:33,019
Yeah. A little more heavy
on the smoke. Little more smoke.

942
01:24:33,461 --> 01:24:34,929
- Good.
- If he gets more smoke....

943
01:24:35,096 --> 01:24:38,396
"'The first to feel the touch
of the rosy beams of morning.

944
01:24:38,566 --> 01:24:44,164
The last to bid-- The last to bid
the sun good night.' John Muir."

945
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:50,441
It's never too soon to think
of the boys' education.

946
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:53,074
- Thought of doing something about that?
- What?

947
01:24:53,247 --> 01:24:55,773
- That twitch.
- What twitch? I don't have a twitch.

948
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:58,419
You do. Come and see me.
Don't touch it.

949
01:24:58,586 --> 01:25:00,612
It'll give you a phobia.
I'll fix it for free.

950
01:25:00,788 --> 01:25:02,347
Oh, thanks. I will.

951
01:25:02,523 --> 01:25:05,459
You know, I like you a lot more
than I ever thought I would.

952
01:25:05,626 --> 01:25:09,757
Warren, you're a beautiful human being.

953
01:25:53,073 --> 01:25:55,565
Hi. You look better.

954
01:25:55,743 --> 01:25:57,234
I feel marvelous.

955
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,341
Michael and Stevie?

956
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:02,147
We're gonna see the penguins.

957
01:26:02,383 --> 01:26:03,749
Everything okay with you?

958
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:06,186
I'm fine.

959
01:26:12,893 --> 01:26:16,352
Beaks are all tightened up.
Their flippers smoothed down.

960
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:18,624
Their eyes brave and courageous.

961
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:24,200
Higher and higher, until eventually,
after a long, arduous journey...

962
01:26:24,371 --> 01:26:27,068
...they arrive at the summit
of penguindom.

963
01:26:27,241 --> 01:26:30,575
And here comes Elgin first.
And behind him, it looks like George.

964
01:26:30,845 --> 01:26:33,815
Behind him is Ringo.
And behind him is Robert.

965
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:36,883
Elgin's gonna do his famous
three-quarter-turn-to-the-left dive.

966
01:26:37,051 --> 01:26:40,044
Okay, come on down, Elgin. That hurt.

967
01:26:40,721 --> 01:26:42,246
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah. This is Elgin.

968
01:26:42,423 --> 01:26:45,552
He's coming out to play
the Humboldt concerto today.

969
01:26:46,393 --> 01:26:50,228
His beak is insured
with Lloyd's of London for $50,000...

970
01:26:50,397 --> 01:26:52,957
...so we have to be very careful with him.

971
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,767
Who we gonna have dive first?

972
01:26:55,936 --> 01:27:01,568
It looks like George, believe it or not.
George, in his 45th dive today.

973
01:27:01,742 --> 01:27:03,335
Getting set.

974
01:27:03,511 --> 01:27:06,071
George is gonna do
his beautiful jackknife dive...

975
01:27:06,247 --> 01:27:09,046
...that he won at the Cannes Olympics.

976
01:27:09,617 --> 01:27:12,109
The second prize, I gave him the dive.

977
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,754
All the surfboard riders, just the agile,
flexible, courageous, brave penguins.

978
01:27:23,931 --> 01:27:25,194
We've got four.

979
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:30,031
We're going for five. Okay, turn around.
Wait a minute. We got a fifth.

980
01:27:30,638 --> 01:27:33,130
I think. Yes. All right.

981
01:27:33,307 --> 01:27:35,640
And send it out to sea.

982
01:27:35,809 --> 01:27:38,779
Then the cry goes out,
"Leopard shark, leopard shark!"

983
01:27:58,632 --> 01:28:03,297
Elgin, I'll start talking about your divorce,
about your brother-in-law...

984
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:08,067
...and how things were in Las Vegas.
Here we go.

985
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,246
The mums are coming in fine...

986
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:18,215
...but the hydrangeas are losing moisture
around the roots.

987
01:28:18,385 --> 01:28:20,401
If we can crumble it
before we put them in.

988
01:28:20,426 --> 01:28:21,937
Best thing to do, of course.

989
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:33,160
We were supposed to be out of here
before you got home, Dr. Bollen...

990
01:28:33,334 --> 01:28:36,930
...so you'd think it had gotten here
by magic.

991
01:28:37,671 --> 01:28:39,765
Wonderful, isn't it?

992
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:43,775
Gives you something alive
in all this steel and glass.

993
01:28:45,646 --> 01:28:47,410
I'm afraid there's been some mistake.

994
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:52,250
Ron and I get a big kick
out of people's first reaction.

995
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,189
Now, this is not a toy.

996
01:28:55,356 --> 01:28:59,555
This is a working greenhouse.
These control your heat and your humidity.

997
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,491
This one's the heat,
and this one here is the humidity.

998
01:29:02,663 --> 01:29:05,292
You got a little bit of everything.
Hydrangeas, zinnias--

999
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:09,130
- Marigolds, petunias....
- You even have a little vegetable garden.

1000
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:12,398
The thing to remember
is to keep the sun out.

1001
01:29:12,573 --> 01:29:16,271
- Sun will kill it.
- These new lights work so much better.

1002
01:29:16,443 --> 01:29:18,810
Are you sure you haven't got
the wrong apartment?

1003
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:23,075
- Oh, no, Dr. Bollen.
- What screwball--?

1004
01:29:25,352 --> 01:29:29,084
- There wasn't a gift card?
- It might come by mail.

1005
01:29:29,256 --> 01:29:32,784
- And this is the heat and this is humidity.
- Exactly.

1006
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:35,087
Okay, Dr. Bollen?

1007
01:30:41,128 --> 01:30:42,494
Hi.

1008
01:30:42,995 --> 01:30:45,146
Did you get Mother
on the plane all right?

1009
01:30:45,202 --> 01:30:45,979
Sure.

1010
01:30:46,133 --> 01:30:48,068
But what a dinky plane.

1011
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:51,501
Poor Mama's stomach problems
are far from over.

1012
01:30:55,142 --> 01:30:57,543
You didn't leave Papa
in that horrible little town?

1013
01:30:57,711 --> 01:30:59,942
It's not such a horrible little town.

1014
01:31:00,114 --> 01:31:02,015
Hearts of artichokes.

1015
01:31:02,616 --> 01:31:06,383
- David.
- Take your vitamin C, you limey.

1016
01:31:19,299 --> 01:31:22,633
Papa went with her at the last minute.

1017
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:26,907
She looked so pale and scared.

1018
01:31:27,074 --> 01:31:29,100
They're not even pressurized.

1019
01:31:29,476 --> 01:31:30,944
The plane.

1020
01:31:31,278 --> 01:31:36,239
You suck on a tube
and hope it's oxygen.

1021
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:46,760
Open.

1022
01:31:46,994 --> 01:31:49,156
How could he, just like that?
What made him--?

1023
01:31:49,329 --> 01:31:51,889
Well, where Mama's concerned,
Papa's a very loving man.

1024
01:31:52,065 --> 01:31:53,328
Come on, now--

1025
01:31:54,268 --> 01:31:55,827
Please don't.

1026
01:31:58,438 --> 01:32:02,534
He promised.
He promised he wouldn't leave us alone.

1027
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:04,143
Honey...

1028
01:32:05,913 --> 01:32:08,212
...it's gonna be okay.

1029
01:32:09,183 --> 01:32:11,277
I cross my heart.

1030
01:32:12,352 --> 01:32:14,218
He promised!

1031
01:32:15,889 --> 01:32:19,951
Hello there, you gorgeous people.
Everybody's invited for margaritas.

1032
01:32:20,194 --> 01:32:21,958
Mr. and Mrs. Danner have gone.

1033
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:25,155
Lucky you.

1034
01:32:42,649 --> 01:32:44,413
Well?

1035
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:46,847
Come on.

1036
01:32:48,155 --> 01:32:51,023
- Come on.
- We didn't have to come back this early.

1037
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:53,422
You're still not 100 percent well.

1038
01:32:58,465 --> 01:33:00,457
Icy hands.

1039
01:33:10,944 --> 01:33:13,470
I didn't ask Papa to leave.

1040
01:33:16,183 --> 01:33:19,585
All he had were the clothes
on his back.

1041
01:33:28,028 --> 01:33:30,224
I didn't want him to leave.

1042
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,435
All right, David.

1043
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:38,662
"All right, David."

1044
01:33:40,173 --> 01:33:42,335
Through clenched teeth.

1045
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:51,408
Only a crazy man hits a woman.

1046
01:33:52,886 --> 01:33:54,514
Or a coward.

1047
01:33:58,258 --> 01:33:59,920
I won't...

1048
01:34:01,461 --> 01:34:03,123
...ever again.

1049
01:34:07,935 --> 01:34:11,702
I'd put my hand down a garbage disposal.

1050
01:34:12,906 --> 01:34:15,808
I would, Petulia. I'd grind it off.

1051
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,828
Hang on to it.

1052
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:46,167
If I come for you, let me have a flare.

1053
01:34:46,373 --> 01:34:48,342
Right between the eyes.

1054
01:34:49,209 --> 01:34:50,541
I'll melt in 10 seconds.

1055
01:34:51,345 --> 01:34:53,109
I wouldn't do that.

1056
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,715
You're too beautiful to melt.

1057
01:34:59,753 --> 01:35:02,222
Girls are beautiful.

1058
01:35:03,623 --> 01:35:06,491
So are unicorns, centaurs...

1059
01:35:07,127 --> 01:35:09,460
...cavalry officers.

1060
01:35:10,297 --> 01:35:11,788
Short-order cooks.

1061
01:35:11,965 --> 01:35:13,831
Poets...

1062
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:15,461
...men of science.

1063
01:35:23,944 --> 01:35:28,109
When I first saw you,
you were being charming to someone...

1064
01:35:28,281 --> 01:35:30,807
...someone who didn't even buy the boat.

1065
01:35:30,984 --> 01:35:32,782
And you were wearing...

1066
01:35:34,755 --> 01:35:37,486
...a pale-blue polo-neck sweater...

1067
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:42,185
...and sunglasses pushed up
in your hair and sandals...

1068
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:44,297
...no socks.

1069
01:35:44,931 --> 01:35:48,390
Fancy trying to sell a 50-foot yacht
with no socks on.

1070
01:35:50,904 --> 01:35:55,342
And I thought you were
the most perfect thing I'd ever seen.

1071
01:35:56,977 --> 01:35:59,037
"Why, he can't be real, he must be...

1072
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,413
...one of those plastic gadgets
the Americans make so well.

1073
01:36:05,585 --> 01:36:07,986
Oh, but I want one."

1074
01:36:24,438 --> 01:36:26,737
Hey, relax.

1075
01:36:27,874 --> 01:36:29,740
We don't have to.

1076
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,312
You say when, huh?

1077
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:38,380
If ever.

1078
01:36:40,987 --> 01:36:42,956
If...

1079
01:36:43,123 --> 01:36:44,682
...never.

1080
01:36:54,468 --> 01:36:56,528
I'll have to admit...

1081
01:36:58,805 --> 01:37:00,137
...I'm not ugly.

1082
01:37:00,307 --> 01:37:03,072
- Ugly? Why, David--
- Stop it!

1083
01:37:04,411 --> 01:37:05,902
Petulia.

1084
01:37:07,881 --> 01:37:09,713
Stop it.

1085
01:37:12,519 --> 01:37:14,545
Stop it.

1086
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:18,752
My baby.

1087
01:37:18,925 --> 01:37:20,621
My baby.

1088
01:37:20,794 --> 01:37:23,286
My baby.

1089
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:31,669
So Chiang Kai-shek says to himself,
"Goddamn, how can I make a nickel?"

1090
01:37:31,838 --> 01:37:35,138
Now, it costs him 2 and a half cents
to make the average boiler...

1091
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:37,106
...and he aggrandizes all that property.

1092
01:37:37,277 --> 01:37:41,305
It costs us $100,000
to put a VC underground....

1093
01:37:41,481 --> 01:37:44,781
- Where are the kids?
- They're with my boys at my ex-wife's.

1094
01:37:44,951 --> 01:37:46,783
They're having such a great time, Archie.

1095
01:37:46,953 --> 01:37:50,446
So they sent over two bonded
messengers to pick up the loot.

1096
01:37:50,624 --> 01:37:53,287
You tell them I've decided
to skip it this year.

1097
01:37:53,627 --> 01:37:58,861
- Oh, would you finish pouring?
- Oh, we really haven't time.

1098
01:37:59,032 --> 01:38:02,491
Actually, what I need
is a nice, quiet blood transfusion.

1099
01:38:02,802 --> 01:38:06,432
Yeah. About 20 minutes.

1100
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:10,005
All this split-second precision.

1101
01:38:10,177 --> 01:38:12,840
- No, no, come straight up.
- My folks and Warren's father.

1102
01:38:13,013 --> 01:38:15,380
- Right.
- Your Aunt Clara, you forget.

1103
01:38:15,549 --> 01:38:17,142
Bye-bye, baby.

1104
01:38:19,786 --> 01:38:22,950
- The fabulous 40s?
- Oh, fabulous.

1105
01:38:24,191 --> 01:38:26,456
Day and Night Ambulance Service.

1106
01:38:26,626 --> 01:38:30,688
"Serving the American medical community
for 83 years."

1107
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:33,493
- Emergency oxygen?
- They're very sentimental...

1108
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:35,863
...about doctors at Christmas.

1109
01:38:37,037 --> 01:38:40,633
Oh, honey, tell Warren
about that crematorium.

1110
01:38:40,807 --> 01:38:44,335
Well, they seem to be ignoring me
this Christmas.

1111
01:38:44,511 --> 01:38:48,141
- What was the name of it?
- I can't remember.

1112
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:55,989
This red one is for your kids.

1113
01:38:57,224 --> 01:39:01,093
- Archie, that's very nice.
- They're having a great old time...

1114
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:03,059
...our boys.

1115
01:39:08,602 --> 01:39:11,162
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1116
01:39:15,709 --> 01:39:19,271
Four minutes. We're getting there.

1117
01:39:22,048 --> 01:39:26,110
- I thought you said I wasn't gonna suffer.
- You're not suffering.

1118
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:30,919
Watch the door, now.

1119
01:39:41,534 --> 01:39:44,504
They can't keep any secrets
in this hospital.

1120
01:39:45,805 --> 01:39:49,674
- When did you get back?
- Last summer.

1121
01:39:50,577 --> 01:39:52,443
You didn't forget me, Archie?

1122
01:39:52,612 --> 01:39:56,606
How could I? All those laughs.

1123
01:39:57,984 --> 01:40:00,647
So things go better with
Mr. and Mrs. Danner.

1124
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:02,880
Obviously.

1125
01:40:04,057 --> 01:40:06,151
How's Polo and the kids?

1126
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:10,262
She got married. Mike gained 11 pounds.

1127
01:40:11,031 --> 01:40:14,263
How did you happen to pick
this particular hospital?

1128
01:40:14,668 --> 01:40:19,538
Well, I just--
Oliver was very well treated here.

1129
01:40:20,373 --> 01:40:21,966
Why did you let me get away, Archie?

1130
01:40:23,209 --> 01:40:26,338
Bad timing. Dumb Archie.

1131
01:40:26,713 --> 01:40:30,275
Girls like me are very rare.

1132
01:40:35,322 --> 01:40:37,348
I could...

1133
01:40:38,091 --> 01:40:42,153
...call an ambulance, take you
to a private hospital in Oakland.

1134
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:45,624
If we didn't make it, so what,
I've delivered babies in a meatwagon.

1135
01:40:46,032 --> 01:40:49,161
Especially a girl with your pelvis.
Nothing to it.

1136
01:40:50,737 --> 01:40:53,502
You have a very superior pelvis.

1137
01:40:55,909 --> 01:40:58,276
We'd never be apart again.

1138
01:41:01,081 --> 01:41:02,947
You don't mean that.

1139
01:41:03,116 --> 01:41:04,948
I do.

1140
01:41:13,126 --> 01:41:14,754
I hurt.

1141
01:41:16,963 --> 01:41:19,023
Touch it, touch it.

1142
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:21,428
Make the hurt less.

1143
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:29,603
- Would you really?
- Yes.

1144
01:41:29,776 --> 01:41:32,439
Call an ambulance at this late stage?

1145
01:41:33,079 --> 01:41:35,639
No. I'm different now.

1146
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:40,414
Damn it, Archie,
why did we have to go that motel?

1147
01:41:42,622 --> 01:41:44,716
Do you realize...

1148
01:41:44,891 --> 01:41:47,759
...we were hardly more
than a one-night stand?

1149
01:41:48,128 --> 01:41:51,064
We didn't even give each other a cold.

1150
01:41:51,965 --> 01:41:54,332
Did I change you, Archie?

1151
01:41:54,934 --> 01:41:59,269
- You turned me into a nut.
- Is that good?

1152
01:41:59,439 --> 01:42:03,501
- I guess so, I don't know. I hope.
- Call an ambulance, Archie.

1153
01:42:23,430 --> 01:42:25,626
When I lie dying...

1154
01:42:25,799 --> 01:42:28,428
...wondering what my life's
all been about...

1155
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:31,127
...you won't even cross my mind.

1156
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:39,269
No, wait, I lied.

1157
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:41,441
About what?

1158
01:42:41,948 --> 01:42:43,712
I'll never forget you, Arnold.

1159
01:42:44,551 --> 01:42:46,417
<i>Arnold?!</i>

1160
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:39,468
Archie?
