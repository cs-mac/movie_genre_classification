{200}{350}Subs Fixed By Pacman
{2272}{2355}Strange beautiful grass of green...
{2362}{2430}with your majestic silver seas.
{2445}{2532}Your mysterious mountains|l wish to see closer.
{2547}{2607}May l land my kinky machine.
{2685}{2767}The first time l ever saw a movie|at the Cinematheque Française...
{2775}{2840}l thought only the French...
{2847}{2920}would house a cinema|inside a palace.
{3187}{3260}The movie was Sam Fuller's|'Shock Corridor'.
{3267}{3355}lts images were so powerful,|it was like being hypnotised.
{3425}{3485}l was 20 years old.|lt was the late 60s.
{3492}{3557}l'd come to Paris for a year|to study French.
{3565}{3622}Here l got my real education.
{3667}{3762}l became a member of what|was kind of a freemasonry.
{3772}{3827}The freemasonry of cinephiles.
{3835}{3885}What we'd call 'film buffs'.
{4065}{4107}l was one of the insatiables...
{4115}{4195}the ones you'd always find|sitting closest to the screen.
{4232}{4287}Why do we sit so close?
{4307}{4377}Maybe it was because we wanted|to receive the images first,
{4392}{4462}when they were still new,|still fresh,
{4470}{4545}before they cleared|the hurdles of the rows behind us.
{4552}{4615}Before they had been relayed back|from row to row,
{4622}{4655}spectatorto spectator,
{4662}{4742}until, worn out, second-hand,|the size of a postage stamp,
{4750}{4792}it returned to the|projectionist's cabin.
{4800}{4872}Doctor, l'm not nuts,|l'm here forthe paper!
{4880}{4940}Maybe, too, the screen|really was a screen.
{4960}{5025}lt screened us from the world.
{5302}{5335}But there was one evening,
{5342}{5400}in the spring of 1968,
{5412}{5490}when the world finally burst|through the screen.
{5497}{5575}Obeying an obscure coalition|of dubious interests,
{5582}{5642}the Minister Malraux has driven...
{5650}{5700}Henri Langlois|out of French Cinematheque.
{5707}{5805}Chaillot offered us all|a free and fair conception...
{5812}{5855}of film culture.
{5862}{5952}Now, for bureaucratic reasons,|culture's arch-enemies...
{5960}{6012}have seized this bastion of liberty.
{6052}{6095}Resist them!
{6102}{6155}-Liberty isn't given!|-lt's taken!
{6162}{6195}All those who love film...
{6202}{6232}-ln France.|-And abroad.
{6240}{6320}-Are with you.|-And with Henry Langlois!
{6560}{6627}Henri Langlois|created the Cinematheque.
{6635}{6677}Because he liked to show movies...
{6685}{6747}instead of letting them rot|in some underground vault.
{6755}{6820}He'd show any movies,|good, bad, old, new...
{6827}{6892}silents, westerns, thrillers.
{6900}{6995}All the new wave filmmakers|came here to learn their craft.
{7022}{7092}This is where modern cinema|was born.
{7137}{7180}What lies behind it: the police!
{7240}{7295}Langlois had been sacked|by the Government.
{7302}{7382}Every film buff in Paris|had turned out in protest.
{7410}{7482}lt was our very own cultural|revolution.
{8075}{8100}Excuse me...
{8180}{8217}Can you remove this?
{8240}{8300}-lt's stuck to my lips.|-What?
{8307}{8385}Can you remove my cigarette?|lt's stuck.
{8397}{8455}Yes, yes... Of course.
{8522}{8550}Sorry.
{8587}{8652}-What are you? English?|-No, l'm American.
{8660}{8707}You can put it out now.
{8805}{8857}-What's your name?|-Matthew.
{8865}{8937}You're here a lot.|But you nevertalk to anyone.
{8945}{9050}-Why are you always alone?|-l don't really know anybody.
{9080}{9145}-Why are you chained to the gates?|-l'm not chained to the gates.
{9267}{9310}You're awfully clean.
{9317}{9392}For someone who likes|the cinema so much.
{9400}{9435}Do you know Jacques?
{9442}{9517}lf shit could shit,|it would smell like Jacques.
{9525}{9562}My brother's gone to talk to him.
{9570}{9625}When he gets back,|you'll smell Jacques on him.
{9632}{9677}lt's like being around pigs.
{9717}{9765}-You speak English really well.|-What?
{9772}{9867}-You speak English really well.|-My mother's English.
{9875}{9922}Here's Theo.|When l introduce you, just...
{9930}{9972}-give him a sniff.|-Come on.
{9980}{10040}Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette,
{10047}{10115}and Renoir, Jean Rouch,|Rohmer are here.
{10122}{10187}Signoret, Jean Marais|and God knows who else.
{10195}{10220}Marcel Carne too.
{10227}{10267}Why is Carne here?
{10275}{10337}What should we do?|Stay or leave?
{10345}{10380}l don't know.
{10397}{10470}Theo. This is Matthew.
{10495}{10555}-You were right, he's American.|-Hi.
{10625}{10715}l've seen you around. You've been|coming to all the Nicholas Ray's.
{10722}{10815}-Yeah, l really like his movies.|-What? 'They Live By Night'?
{10845}{10872}More like...
{10880}{10955}'Johnny Guitar'|and 'Rebel Without A Cause'.
{10975}{11027}You know what Godard|wrote about him?
{11037}{11107}-No, what?|-'Nicholas Ray is cinema.'
{11142}{11180}-What's up with you?|-Me?
{11187}{11232}Stay with me! Quick!
{11857}{11900}Bastards!
{11997}{12042}Fascists!
{12055}{12130}-Bastards!|-Assholes!
{12207}{12302}And that was how l first met|Theo and lsabelle.
{12517}{12567}l could hear my heart pounding.
{12575}{12650}l don't know if it was because|l'd just been chased by the police,
{12657}{12727}or because l was already|in love with my new friends.
{12735}{12835}As we walked and talked,|about politics, about movies,
{12842}{12937}and why the French could never|produce good rock bands...
{12945}{13017}-l'm starving.|-l forgot the sandwiches.
{13025}{13095}l didn't want that night everto end.
{13137}{13175}Thank you.
{13182}{13240}-Didn't you bring anything?|-No, l'm okay.
{13247}{13305}Please, eat. Don't mind me.
{13342}{13420}-No, l'm really not hungry.|-l've broken it now. Take it.
{13427}{13505}-You're very kind, but...|-Take it when you're offered it!
{13512}{13542}Thank you.
{13552}{13625}Theo. Don't you have|something for Matthew?
{13632}{13702}-This is fine.|-l gave him a third of mine.
{13787}{13860}l didn't come here|to eat your sandwiches.
{13867}{13925}-He doesn't want it.|-Yes, he does.
{13935}{14030}-He's just too polite to say he does.|-You're both very kind.
{14037}{14092}Where are you from exactly?
{14100}{14122}San Diego.
{14142}{14235}What about you two?|Were you both born in Paris?
{14255}{14347}l entered this world|on the Champs-Elysees. 1959.
{14355}{14400}On the pavement.
{14412}{14510}-You know what my first words were?|-No, what?
{14532}{14570}'New York Herald-Tribune.'
{14582}{14635}New York Herald-Tribune.
{14642}{14670}'New York Herald-Tribune.'
{14687}{14755}New York Herald-Tribune.
{14767}{14820}Will you come to Rome with me?
{14940}{15025}-Here, right here. Here!|-No, there!
{15050}{15100}-Goodnight, Matthew.|-Goodnight.

{16307}{16337}Dear mom:
{16367}{16440}l've got some real news this time.
{16465}{16552}l've just met|my first French friends.

{17705}{17767}-Who is this?|-Don't be suspicious. lt's me.
{17780}{17830}-Theo?|-Did l wake you up?
{17837}{17950}-l've been up for ages.|-You don't sound like that.
{17975}{18022}l always sound|like this in the morning.
{18030}{18095}l had to call early,|l've a class at nine.
{18117}{18230}You want to have dinner|tomorrow night with lsa and me?
{18302}{18372}A real dinner in a nice restaurant?
{18382}{18460}No, not in a restaurant.|Here. At home.
{18477}{18537}Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
{18545}{18585}Yes? Okay.

{18672}{18772}Meet us for a drink first.|At the Respite. Six o'clock.

{19107}{19167}-Third floor!|-Third floor?
{19177}{19230}There's room in here for all of us.
{19237}{19280}Theo and l are contagious!
{19292}{19372}-We're very contagious.|-Contagious?
{19400}{19445}You shouldn't catch us!
{19887}{19937}-lt's beautiful.|-You think so?
{19945}{19980}Good luck.
{20195}{20222}Evening, maman.
{20280}{20320}What are you doing here?
{20327}{20370}-We're here for dinner.|-What?
{20377}{20417}With Matthew.
{20427}{20480}-Didn't lsabelle say?|-Which Matthew?
{20487}{20565}This Matthew.|He's our new friend.
{20572}{20612}Matthew, this is my mother.
{20620}{20687}-Very pleased to meet you.|-Likewise.
{20717}{20755}You're American, are you?
{20762}{20807}Yeah, l'm from California.
{20815}{20877}Matthew lives in a nasty student|hotel. Rue Malebranche.
{20885}{20930}So we invited him to dinner.
{20960}{21025}-What's wrong?|-What can l say?
{21032}{21105}l'm cooking fortwo|and now there are five of us.
{21112}{21195}-Didn't Theo tell you?|-No, he didn't. And neither did you.
{21202}{21272}Have you got mashed potatoes|for brains or what?
{21280}{21360}-You were supposed to tell her!|-You're crazy!
{21367}{21422}Bitch, cow, slut...
{21430}{21495}Put a sock in it, you two!
{21560}{21627}l must apologise|for my children's behaviour.
{21635}{21705}No, l'm the one|who should be apologising.
{21712}{21770}Please don't put yourself out|on account of me.
{21777}{21837}Very sweet of you, seeing|as you're completely blameless.
{21927}{21962}Let me look at you.
{21992}{22070}l want you to make|a good impression on papa.
{22352}{22420}Dad, it's me.|We're eating in.
{22442}{22520}-And the cinematheque?|-Closed until further notice.
{22547}{22647}Can't you see we have a guest?|This is Matthew.
{22712}{22740}Sir.
{22747}{22817}-Matthew.|-Matthew's dining with us tonight.
{22837}{22920}My young Matthew.|lnspiration is like a baby.
{22942}{23035}lt does not choose a nice,|seemly hourto enterthe world.
{23050}{23130}lt has no consideration|forthe poor poet.
{23177}{23230}But when it does come,
{23237}{23315}when it deigns to come,|then you know it's...
{23462}{23500}Young man...
{23507}{23582}l was speaking to you.|l imagined you were listening.
{23590}{23642}l was. l'm sorry.
{23672}{23717}What?
{23737}{23780}Nothing, l was just...
{23847}{23882}You seem to be mesmerised...
{23890}{23962}by this tin lighter.|l'd like to know why.
{24030}{24090}-Well?|-George, Matthew's our guest.
{24097}{24195}l'm genuinely curious.|l'd like to know why.
{24287}{24350}l was fidgeting with lsabelle's lighter.
{24357}{24465}l wasn't really realising it, and then|l noticed and l thought it was rude,
{24472}{24517}so l put it down on the table.
{24525}{24610}But l put it diagonally across|one of these squares. Do you see?
{24642}{24680}Look, l'll show you.
{24692}{24742}That's when l noticed|that the lighter's length...
{24750}{24827}is exactly the same length|as the diagonal itself.
{24835}{24887}So l put it lengthwise...
{24912}{24965}along the outside edge. Look, it...
{24990}{25035}it fits there too.
{25070}{25110}But it fits there.
{25147}{25210}And it fits like this and like this.
{25247}{25290}And this way too.
{25312}{25405}And l bet you if l just split it in half...
{25412}{25462}you know it's gonna fit somewhere.
{25495}{25540}lt really fits anywhere.
{25582}{25617}See?
{25632}{25700}l was noticing that|the more you look at everything...
{25707}{25810}this table, the objects on it,|the refrigerator, this room...
{25817}{25877}your nose, the world...
{25907}{25945}Suddenly...
{25962}{25997}you realise that...
{26007}{26080}there's some sort|of cosmic harmony...
{26087}{26147}of shapes and sizes.
{26207}{26295}l was just wondering why.|l don't know why that is.
{26320}{26355}l know that it is.
{26540}{26595}You have an interesting friend here.
{26607}{26672}More interesting,|l suspect, than you know.
{26747}{26847}l mean, when we look around us,|what is it we see?
{26862}{26902}Chaos, isn't it?
{26910}{26957}Complete chaos.
{26977}{27090}Yet, viewed from above,|as it were, by God,
{27112}{27175}everything suddenly fits together.
{27245}{27350}My children believe that|their demonstrations and sit-ins,
{27357}{27402}and happenings...
{27430}{27495}They believe that|these possess the capacity...
{27502}{27610}not only to provoke society,|but also to transform it.
{27737}{27775}What is it you are saying?
{27782}{27850}lf Langlois is dismissed,|we shouldn't do anything?
{27857}{27902}lf immigrants are deported,
{27910}{27975}if students are beaten up,|we shouldn't do anything?
{27982}{28065}What l'm saying is that|a little lucidity would not go amiss.
{28077}{28145}So, everyone's wrong but you?
{28177}{28230}ln France, in ltaly,|Germany, America...
{28237}{28290}Before you can change the world,
{28297}{28370}you must realise|you yourself are part of it.
{28382}{28442}You can't stand outside looking in.
{28462}{28522}You're the one who stands outside.
{28537}{28612}You're the one who refused to sign|a petition against the Vietnam War.
{28622}{28695}Poets don't sign petitions.|They sign poems.
{28715}{28810}-A petition is a poem.|-Yes. And a poem is a petition.
{28817}{28860}Thank you, Theo,|but l'm not gaga yet.
{28867}{28917}l don't need you|to remind me of my own work.
{28965}{28997}That's right.
{29007}{29072}A petition is a poem|and a poem is a petition.
{29092}{29182}Those are the most famous lines|you ever wrote.
{29227}{29277}And now look at you.
{29335}{29402}-l hope l'll never become like him.|-Theo.
{29440}{29515}We should say goodnight.|We've got a long day tomorrow.
{29577}{29605}George?
{29617}{29665}Yes, sorry. You were saying?
{29672}{29707}We should get to bed.
{29772}{29837}You had something|to tell the children.
{29857}{29917}Yes, of course.|l'm sorry.
{29937}{29995}The cheques are on the mantelpiece.
{30002}{30055}Don't cash them until you need them.
{30112}{30157}Good night, everybody.
{30180}{30230}Good night, papa.|Have a safe journey.
{30252}{30285}Good night, dear.
{30292}{30332}Theo?
{30362}{30440}-A very good night to you.|-lt was a pleasure meeting you, sir.
{30462}{30500}-Good night.|-Good night.
{30507}{30575}-Very nice meeting you.|-Thank you so much for dinner.
{30582}{30652}lt's my pleasure.|lnvite Matthew to spend the night.
{30660}{30722}l don't like the sound|of Hotel Malebranche.
{30740}{30765}Good night.
{31422}{31535}Why haven't you dazzled us|with your philosophical speculations?
{31545}{31640}-l didn't know l was philosophical.|-Papa was awfully impressed.
{31647}{31695}Papa's full of shit.
{31712}{31747}l think you're lucky.
{31755}{31815}l wish my parents were that nice.
{31822}{31900}Other people's parents|are always nicerthan our own.
{31917}{32042}And yet, our own grandparents|are always nicerthan other people's.
{32085}{32150}That's true, that's absolutely true.
{32157}{32210}l neverthought about it before.
{32217}{32295}-But it's true.|-Matthew, you're sweet.
{32357}{32445}This is double the length of...
{32530}{32562}l'm for bed.
{32885}{32920}Are you staying?
{32957}{33020}-Are you okay?|-Yeah, l'm okay.
{33055}{33092}Goodnight, Matthew.
{33362}{33405}Everybody's got a father.
{33425}{33450}Yes.
{33472}{33535}But the fact that God doesn't exist,
{33542}{33607}doesn't mean he can take His place.
{34680}{34705}Okay?
{34780}{34822}-Yeah, it's fine.|-Goodnight.
{34845}{34895}-Goodnight.|-See you in the morning.
{34902}{34937}See you. Thank...
{34975}{35000}Thank you.
{35437}{35510}l need a man to love me.
{35547}{35615}Oh, don't you understand me, babe?

{35832}{35915}l want me,|someone to hold me when l...

{36115}{36140}Can't be now.
{36147}{36177}Can't be now.
{36185}{36240}Can't be now.
{36247}{36282}Can't be now.
{36290}{36350}Can't be just loneliness.
{36362}{36430}What the hell is wrong with me?
{36437}{36492}No, no, no, it just can't be...
{39627}{39665}Good morning.
{39752}{39792}What was that all about?
{39800}{39847}l was removing the sleep|from your eyes.
{39855}{39912}Theo lets me do his every morning.
{39952}{40045}-lt's a strange thing to want to do.|-Didn't you enjoy it?
{40082}{40145}-Was l supposed to?|-Naturally.
{40322}{40352}Up, up, up!
{40362}{40442}-What are you waiting for?|-lsabelle, l'm not dressed.

{46755}{46815}-Don't take too long.|-Don't worry, l won't.

{47077}{47157}Don't forget yourtoothbrush!
{47192}{47217}Okay.
{47435}{47550}Dear mom: l guess you're surprised|to be hearing from me so soon.
{47557}{47620}But l've just moved|into an apartment...
{47627}{47675}belonging to|a famous French author...
{47682}{47757}whose children are the same age|as me and have the same interests.
{47765}{47857}l'm getting in|with the right kind of people.
{47875}{47945}Say hello to father.|l hope he's not still mad at me.
{47952}{47992}Listen to this, Matthew.
{48007}{48060}''The difference between|Keaton and Chaplin...
{48067}{48127}is the difference between|prose and poetry,
{48135}{48185}between the aristocrat|and the tramp,
{48192}{48250}between eccentricity and mysticism,
{48257}{48292}between man as machine,
{48300}{48340}and man as angel.''
{48360}{48417}-Not bad, huh?|-That's good.
{48425}{48475}Except for me,|there's no comparison.
{48497}{48560}Why? Because Chaplin's|incomparable?
{48627}{48652}No.
{48662}{48705}Because Keaton is incomparable.
{48732}{48800}You think Keaton's|greaterthan Chaplin?
{48807}{48855}-Absolutely l do.|-You're not serious.
{48862}{48912}-Course l am.|-You're crazy.
{48920}{48997}You can't deny that|Keaton's funnierthan Chaplin.
{49005}{49027}l can.
{49035}{49112}You don't think that Keaton|is funnierthan Chaplin?
{49120}{49160}Nobody is funnierthan Chaplin.
{49167}{49230}Keaton is. Even when|he's not doing anything.
{49237}{49307}-And he looks like Godard.|-Keaton is a real filmmaker.
{49315}{49365}Chaplin, all he cares|about is his own performance...
{49372}{49417}-His own ego!|-That is bullshit.
{49425}{49480}-lt's not bullshit!|-Yes, it is.
{49487}{49565}You Americans understand|fuck all about your own culture.
{49572}{49615}No wonder you've never got|the point ofJerry Lewis.
{49622}{49685}Don't even get me|started on Jerry Lewis!
{49692}{49790}When Chaplin wanted to have|a beautiful shot, he knew how.
{49797}{49860}Betterthan Keaton,|betterthan anybody.
{49867}{49925}You rememberthe last shot|of 'City Lights'?
{49932}{49975}He looks at the flower-girl,
{49982}{50012}she looks at him,
{50037}{50097}and don't forget she'd been blind,|so she was seeing him...
{50105}{50140}forthe very first time.
{50147}{50240}And it's as if, through her eyes, we|also see him forthe very first time.
{50247}{50312}Charlot, the most|famous man in the world.
{50320}{50375}As if we've|never seen him before.
{50557}{50622}lsa, if you play|that fucking record again,
{50627}{50715}-l'll break it in two, okay?|-But you like Janis Joplin.
{50777}{50802}Stop it!
{50817}{50852}l said stop it, lsabelle!
{50900}{50935}Stop! Stop!
{50942}{50970}Matthew, tell me, what film?
{50977}{51032}-What?|-Name a film...
{51040}{51110}where someone tap-dancing|drives someone else crazy.
{51120}{51177}Forfeit to pay if you can't answer.
{51185}{51237}-You'll pay the forfeit!|-'Top Hat'!
{51250}{51320}Fred Astaire is dancing over|Ginger Rogers' room.
{51407}{51475}And she's mad|because he wakes her up.
{51610}{51635}l'm right.
{51690}{51715}He's good.
{51722}{51770}You thinking what l'm thinking?
{51787}{51815}What?
{51825}{51895}-'Bande a part'.|-You're right.
{51902}{51970}Why are you two|looking at me like that?
{51997}{52077}Well... you see, my little Matthew...
{52100}{52175}There's something Theo and l have|been meaning to do for a long time,
{52182}{52245}but we've been waiting forthe right|person to do it with.
{52252}{52312}-And l think you're finally it!|-To do what?
{52320}{52370}Try to beat the record|of 'Bande a Part'.
{52377}{52430}-What record?|-You've seen 'Bande a Part'.
{52437}{52517}The scene where the three of them|race through the Louvre.
{52527}{52617}They try to beat the world record|of 9 minutes 45 seconds.
{52625}{52690}-Of course!|-We're going to beat their record.
{52787}{52810}What?
{52820}{52850}What's the matter?
{52867}{52927}-Nothing really.|-Not afraid, are you?
{52935}{53002}-No, l'm not afraid.|-What then?
{53017}{53102}lt's easy for you two.|l'm an American, an alien.
{53110}{53172}lf l get caught, l get deported.
{53187}{53285}-We're not going to get caught.|-You don't know that.
{53292}{53375}They weren't caught in 'Bande a|Part', we won't be caught either.
{53382}{53437}-lt's a movie!|-Go get papa's stopwatch.
{53455}{53497}lt's a great idea, but...
{53505}{53570}-lt's not...|-This is a test.
{53582}{53655}Are you going to pass it or fail it?
{53670}{53767}Be careful. A lot depends|on how you answer.
{54582}{54680}9 minutes and 28 seconds.|We beat the record by 1 7 seconds!
{54687}{54720}We did it!
{54755}{54845}Matthew, my little Matthew.|You were wonderful!
{54982}{55025}'We accept him. One of us.'
{55032}{55077}'We accept him. One of us.'
{55085}{55130}We accept him. One of us.

{57012}{57082}lsa's smart but she doesn't know|how to deal with parents.
{57090}{57120}What do you mean?
{57130}{57185}l mean, it's not enough|to ignore them,
{57192}{57245}they should all be arrested,
{57260}{57300}put on trial,
{57307}{57362}confess their crimes,
{57370}{57485}sent to the country|for self-criticism and re-education!

{69467}{69510}Do you think lsabelle forced me?
{69810}{69897}Deep down, l knew things|couldn't go on as before.
{69905}{69957}Now the stakes had been raised.
{69982}{70095}For a while, there was a kind|of truce between Theo and lsabelle.

{103317}{103340}-Good?|-Yeah.

{103427}{103480}Clapton is God, Matthew.
{103495}{103517}l don't believe in God.
{103525}{103615}But if l did, he would be|a Black left-handed guitarist.
{103642}{103750}This is not Chaplin and Keaton.|This is Clapton and Hendrix.
{103772}{103825}Clapton reinvented|the electric guitar.
{103832}{103887}-Clapton reinvented the guitar!|-Matthew, believe me.
{103895}{103960}-Clapton plugs in a guitar...|-Okay, Jimi Hendrix is different...
{103967}{104030}He plugs in an electric guitar and|he plays it like an acoustic guitar.
{104037}{104112}Hendrix plugs in an electric guitar,|he plays with his teeth!
{104245}{104320}There are soldiers|in the Vietnam War right now.
{104327}{104365}Who are they listening to?
{104372}{104420}Clapton? No.
{104432}{104507}They're listening to Hendrix.|The guy who tells the truth.
{104515}{104557}lt's all fucked up!
{104565}{104630}You're talking about soldiers|in Vietnam?
{104637}{104682}-Yes.|-What are they doing in Vietnam?

{104877}{104950}They're killing children,|they're burning fields!
{104957}{105040}They wanna be there. They wanna|die and they wanna kill people.
{105047}{105105}Shouldn't you be in Vietnam?
{105132}{105190}-Shouldn't you be in Vietnam?|-l don't believe in violence.
{105197}{105250}Where are you now?|Shouldn't you be in Vietnam?
{105257}{105307}l'm lucky, l'm in a university.
{105315}{105382}l have friends|who aren't in university...
{105390}{105422}and they're expendable.
{105430}{105510}-You're not lucky.|-l am fucking lucky.
{105520}{105560}Do you think you can say|to the Government:
{105567}{105645}'No, l'm against violence.|l don't agree with your war.'
{105652}{105725}Maybe in France.|ln America you have to go.
{105732}{105772}lf you don't go, you go to jail.
{105780}{105910}l preferto go in jail,|instead of killing people.
{105917}{105960}You don't understand.
{105970}{106030}l read it in 'Cahiers de Cinema'.
{106037}{106130}A filmmaker is like|a peeping Tom, a voyeur.
{106162}{106215}lt's as if the camera is...
{106260}{106335}the keyhole|to your parents' bedroom.
{106377}{106452}And you spy on them,|and you're disgusting.
{106477}{106517}And you feel guilty,
{106545}{106580}but you can't...
{106617}{106647}look away.
{106660}{106715}lt makes films like crimes and...
{106725}{106775}directors like criminals.
{106852}{106890}Like it should be illegal.
{106910}{106967}There goes my chance|to be a filmmaker.
{106982}{107045}My parents always left|the bedroom door open.
{107122}{107180}You'll have to direct theatre,|not cinema.
{107192}{107215}Maybe.
{107275}{107302}Up.
{107435}{107462}Come on!
{107622}{107687}My parents only fucked|once in their life.
{107692}{107772}That's why we're twins.|They didn't want to make it twice.

{110047}{110085}Oh, yeah.
{110097}{110157}That's not what l wanted you to say.
{110165}{110202}What do you want us to say?
{110225}{110282}l wanted you to say you love me.
{110310}{110377}-We just did.|-No, you said you love me too.
{110385}{110435}l don't want you to say|that you love me too.

{110500}{110572}-We love you, we love you.|-That's not right either.
{110622}{110662}You have to say it first.
{110672}{110745}We can't, you already said it first.
{110752}{110820}Why am l always the first to say it?
{110845}{110895}Poor Matthew.
{110962}{111015}We do love you very much.
{111037}{111115}l don't want to be loved very much.|l want to be loved.
{111162}{111215}You know when someone wants it,
{111222}{111312}there's no such thing as love.|There are only proofs of love.
{111375}{111442}Are you ready to give us|a proof of your love?
{111500}{111532}You want proof of my love?
{111587}{111625}Okay.

{112235}{112282}-You're not serious?|-Yes, l am.
{112290}{112360}Don't worry. lt's an operation|l've performed before.
{112367}{112450}-Relax, it grows back.|-You're both fucking crazy!
{112470}{112532}-What's the matter?|-This is what you call proof of love?
{112540}{112590}Turning me into a freak?|'One of us.'
{112597}{112635}-lt's just a game.|-'One of us.'
{112642}{112677}lt's just a game!
{112687}{112760}A game, lsabelle?|A game? Think about it.

{113352}{113422}You bathe together,|you pee in the john together.
{113430}{113495}You play these little games.
{113502}{113587}l wish you could step out|of yourselves and just look.
{113595}{113655}Why are you so cruel?
{113662}{113735}-Because l love you.|-A strange way of showing it.
{113742}{113805}l really love you. Both of you.
{113812}{113860}And l admire you.

{114032}{114102}You won't grow like this. You won't.
{114110}{114225}Not as long as you keep clinging|to each otherthe way that you do.
{114282}{114355}-Have you ever been out on a date?|-A date?
{114362}{114407}-Yeah, a date.|-What kind of date?
{114415}{114482}-Have you ever been out with a boy?|-With Theo.

{115085}{115175}Would you like to go out on a date|with me? Just the two of us.
{115192}{115242}Don't look at Theo.
{115250}{115312}You don't need his permission.
{116132}{116210}We can't sit in the front row,|we have to sit at the back.
{116225}{116285}The front is for people|who don't have dates.
{116295}{116347}Sorry. Excuse me.
{116362}{116430}On a date, you always sit|at the back.
{116847}{116910}Ladies and gentlemen...
{116927}{117042}the motion picture you are about|to see is a story of music.
{117055}{117130}l play the role of Tom Miller,|an agent.

{117247}{117302}Well, you'll see.
{117312}{117410}This picture was photographed|in the grandeur of cinemascope.
{117475}{117505}Pardon me.
{117862}{117957}Sorry l can't stay,|but l have a train on tap.
{117987}{118032}All the best, Georgie.
{118050}{118115}You can't stand to hear me|sing again, huh?
{118187}{118220}You know it isn't that.
{118245}{118275}You'll never know.
{118282}{118352}No, l know l won't be fooled.
{118392}{118455}When l'm being true.
{118522}{118565}But if you guess it,
{118582}{118632}l'll confess it.
{118647}{118735}Oh, darling,|l would like to know.
{118772}{118822}Or perhaps you'll never...

{119095}{119160}You'll never know.
{120010}{120045}When l looked at the TV screen,
{120052}{120112}l remembered the battle|of the Cinematheque.
{120122}{120195}Except this time the demonstrators|weren't film buffs.
{120202}{120262}They weren't even just students|any longer.
{120317}{120372}lt was hard to figure out|what was happening, but...
{120380}{120455}shops had closed their doors,|factories had gone on strike...
{120462}{120542}and it was beginning to spread|all over Paris.
{120592}{120712}We're willing to consider|all legitimate demands.
{120757}{120810}Theo and l never watch television.
{120817}{120855}We're purest.
{120862}{120890}Pure and hard.
{120902}{120945}-Let's go.|-Yeah, but...

{122927}{123002}-You do have a room of your own?|-Of course l have.
{123010}{123055}Don't think l always live|in Theo's pigsty.
{123062}{123110}How come we never go in there?
{123117}{123185}No-one's making love on my bed.
{123192}{123287}lt's your room, it's part of you,|l wanna see it.
{123297}{123370}-Just tonight.|-No, no, and no.
{123775}{123855}l discovered a side of lsabelle|l'd never seen before.
{123862}{123930}A secret side|she hadn't wanted me to see.
{123967}{124040}l suddenly thought of my sisters'|bedrooms in San Diego.
{124055}{124127}l thought of our house and our|neighbours' houses, all alike,
{124135}{124187}with their green lawns|and their sprinklers,
{124195}{124267}and their station wagons|parked outside.

{125657}{125735}l always wanted to make love|to the Venus de Milo.
{125897}{125927}l can't stop you.
{125937}{125977}l've got no arms.

{132187}{132235}lt's easy to say books not guns.
{132252}{132302}But it's not true.|lt's not 'books'.
{132312}{132400}lt's 'book', a book.|Just one book.
{132407}{132455}Shut up. You sound|just like my father.
{132462}{132500}No, listen to me.
{132507}{132567}The Red Guards|that you admire,
{132575}{132635}they all carry the same book,
{132642}{132690}they all sing the same songs,
{132697}{132752}they all parrot the same slogans.
{132760}{132870}ln this big epic movie,
{132877}{132945}everybody is an extra.
{132997}{133042}That gives me the creeps.
{133075}{133110}l'm sorry to say it, but...
{133130}{133222}for me there is|a distinct contradiction.
{133242}{133267}Why?
{133287}{133317}Because...
{133337}{133445}if you really believed what you were|saying, you'd be out there.
{133457}{133485}Where?
{133492}{133537}Out there on the street.
{133565}{133607}-l don't know what you mean.|-Yes, you do.
{133615}{133645}There's something|going on out there.
{133652}{133727}Something that feels like|it could be really important.
{133735}{133830}Something that feels like things|could change. Even l get that.
{133840}{133875}But you're not out there.
{133882}{133985}You're inside with me, drinking|expensive wine, talking about film.
{133992}{134062}-Talking about Maoism. Why?|-That's enough.
{134070}{134100}No, tell me why.
{134107}{134150}Ask yourself why.
{134177}{134225}l don't think you believe it.
{134232}{134292}l think you buy the lamp,|you put up the posters,
{134300}{134325}but it ain't...
{134345}{134422}-l don't think you...|-Look, you speak too much.
{134430}{134452}Okay.
{134525}{134577}Theo, just listen to me.
{134587}{134645}l think you prefer...
{134652}{134717}l think you prefer when...
{134782}{134852}when the word 'together'|means not...
{134862}{134917}a million, but just two.
