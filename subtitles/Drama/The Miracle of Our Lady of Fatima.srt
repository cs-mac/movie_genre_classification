<i>Francisco and Jacinta
lie in their eternal sleep.</i>

1736
01:40:48,047 --> 01:40:49,712
<i>Through the years,</i>

1737
01:40:49,714 --> 01:40:53,414
<i>Lúcia has devoted
her life to holy service.</i>

1738
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:59,081
Are you happy,
Lúcia?

1739
01:40:59,083 --> 01:41:01,547
More than I can tell you.

1740
01:41:03,549 --> 01:41:08,716
To think that the faith
of you three children

1741
01:41:08,718 --> 01:41:12,516
has brought these millions
to Fátima.

1742
01:41:14,119 --> 01:41:19,085
It is their own faith
that brought them, Hugo,

1743
01:41:19,087 --> 01:41:23,619
their yearning
for peace on earth.

1744
01:41:23,621 --> 01:41:26,220
If the people of the world
will pray

1745
01:41:26,222 --> 01:41:29,820
as Our Lady asked them to,

1746
01:41:29,822 --> 01:41:32,787
God will send us peace.

1747
01:41:41,562 --> 01:42:00,550
