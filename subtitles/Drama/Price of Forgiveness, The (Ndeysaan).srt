1
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,300
Jan

2
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,175
Josef

3
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,210
They sent for you too

4
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,946
What the hell is
it doing about?

5
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,780
I was on leave, out of the
blue they called me back

6
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,715
That's all I know

7
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,205
So?

8
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,825
The general will
see you now

9
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,915
Stand at ease

10
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:56,935
Do you three know
each other?

11
00:04:57,032 --> 00:05:01,025
Uh... Kubis and I do
sir, but... uh...

12
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:04,106
Alright, introduce
yourselves

13
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:06,441
Karel Curda, sir
Born near Prague

14
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:09,044
I was a customs officer
before the war

15
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:12,814
Jan Kubis Born
in Vladaslov

16
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:13,815
I was a farmer

17
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:17,808
Gabcik, sir Josef Gabcik Born
in Pilsum, Locksmith

18
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,288
Good

19
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,290
The mission we
have in mind

20
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,227
can only be undertaken by men
with your qualifications

21
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:29,130
For the past three month
you've been closely observed

22
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,466
You're here now because you
shown us that you have courage

23
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:34,469
endurance and
resourcefulness

24
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:37,238
I am going to ask you to
undertake a mission

25
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:38,473
that regardless
of outcome,

26
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:41,306
will certainly be one of
the most dangerous of the war

27
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:47,070
I need hardly say it, you
are liberty to refuse

28
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:52,654
Good

29
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:55,590
First, I am gonna give you
some background information

30
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,426
And then I'll talk
about the mission itself

31
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:02,163
The Code name is
'Operation Day Break'

32
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:05,600
Reinhard Heydrich came to Prague
three months ago to take up his post

33
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,435
as acting right
protector

34
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:11,339
for what the Nazis now call
'Bohemia and maradia' that means

35
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,275
he has absolute power of life
and death over all Czechs

36
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:20,381
We believe if Adolph
Hitler were to die

37
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:24,285
That Heydrich would become
Führer of the Third Reich.

38
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:28,278
His orders, one to crush
all Czech resistance

39
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,784
Two, to deport large numbers
of the community to work

40
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:37,065
in Germany as slave labor

41
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:39,400
Do not underestimate him

42
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,470
He is not a barbarian
like Hitler

43
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,739
He is the man of the
highest intelligence

44
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:48,142
ruthless, ambitious and
he is the only one

45
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,478
to whom Adolph Hitler
really listens

46
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,480
Your rights protector

47
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,649
I have a petition signed
by all the inhabitance

48
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,818
of a small village
near Pilsum

49
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:59,420
Beggin you, sir to show mercy
to the nine young hostages

50
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,823
due to be executed tomorrow

51
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:04,759
Not one of them is yet
twenty years old

52
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,595
and youngest is
only sixteen

53
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,324
The villagers
do feel that

54
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:18,106
Rights protector says that
whatever happens to the Czechs

55
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:21,442
or to any of Slav is of no
possible interest to him

56
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,206
We intend to parachute you
back into Czechoslovakia

57
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:30,118
To assassinate Heydrich

58
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:32,287
Heydrich is closely
guarded night and day

59
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:36,280
When ever he travels, he is
escorted by highly trained SS men

60
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:41,789
So it will be up to you to formulate
a plan and to carry it out

61
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:47,402
You must find
a way to kill him

62
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:48,736
When do we leave sir?

63
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:52,729
You'll be confined to these
headquarters until further orders

64
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,800
Thank you very much
Good luck

65
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:30,540
Stand by Champs
we are over Pilsum

66
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:47,784
Hold to your mama!

67
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,679
Stop

68
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:52,616
Don't try anything

69
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:56,624
You Czech aren't you?

70
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:57,859
Keep walking

71
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:59,627
Well, I am Czech too.

72
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:01,857
Move

73
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:46,835
Jan!

74
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:02,190
- Twisted bloody ankle
- Can I have a look?

75
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,792
Don't touch it for Christ sake

76
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,695
That guy's the bastard who said we
were gonna drop on a dry clear morning

77
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,130
Did you see Curda?

78
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,299
No, he dripped off
on the other valley

79
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,234
He could be anywhere

80
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,225
Let me lean on you

81
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:28,749
Damn shame

82
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,741
Not so bad if they make us go
after girls in Czechoslovakia

83
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:40,584
Even the snow
tastes different

84
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,164
Safer though

85
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:45,428
You have no
feelings at all

86
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:48,836
Can you manage?

87
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,168
Feels worse than
it is, come on

88
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:13,287
Papers, your papers

89
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:22,403
Where are you going at
this time of the morning?

90
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:23,471
To work?

91
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,640
Where?

92
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,143
Pilsum

93
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,811
Walk to work everyday

94
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,314
You walk two hundred
kilometers everyday?

95
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:35,316
You're no way
near Pilsum

96
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,251
Where have
you come from?

97
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,820
Hands, Hands!

98
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,481
Come on!

99
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,260
Let's go

100
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,504
Bastard R.A.F.

101
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:06,841
Two hundred kilometers
from Pilsum

102
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:10,111
Dropped in a wrong
bloody place

103
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:12,213
God knows
where Curda is

104
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:14,782
So now what do we do?

105
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:17,051
Lost the radio
operator

106
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,619
I can't hardly walk

107
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:21,122
and the entire German
army looking for us

108
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:24,625
Never mind where we are going
we don't even know where we are

109
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,628
And you are
a lot of use

110
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:30,119
No feelings at all

111
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,804
Christ, we
are at quarry

112
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,587
Two men

113
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,707
I know you
are in there

114
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:23,375
It's alright we
won't harm you

115
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,209
I am coming in

116
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:34,387
Come inside both of you

117
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,065
Close the door

118
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:44,405
You can't stay here

119
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:47,141
You're parachutists

120
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:49,477
Look, we can
all be shot

121
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:51,412
I've got a wife
and children

122
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:53,247
I've hurt my foot

123
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,248
We need some help

124
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:57,418
But the place is
swarming with Germans

125
00:16:57,418 --> 00:17:00,087
Really

126
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,755
I haven't
spoken to you

127
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,824
and I haven't
seen you

128
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:06,315
Please go away

129
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,320
See who it is

130
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,707
Germans

131
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,607
Get into the vault

132
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:29,772
Parachutists Have
you seen anybody?

133
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,285
Tell him you've
seen nothing

134
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,277
- But what about...
- Do it before he comes

135
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:43,631
Well, have you
seen anything?

136
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:45,566
It's serious

137
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,403
Ah- it's you

138
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,304
What's going on
in there, eh?

139
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:01,315
One of my men got
hurt in the blast

140
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:03,146
His foot

141
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,323
Give us a lift
to the doctor

142
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:11,592
I'll make it
worth a while

143
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,762
You've been pitching some
of your stocks again?

144
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:18,027
Better unwrapped

145
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,035
Bring him

146
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:17,686
Over here

147
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:22,354
Thank you

148
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,282
Good morning is
your father in?

149
00:19:41,282 --> 00:19:42,549
What's it about?

150
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,551
Emergency We're
from quarry

151
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:48,389
This fellow's
hurt his foot

152
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:50,619
Come this way please

153
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:58,465
Father, two men
from the quarry

154
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,234
One's hurt his foot

155
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:01,802
Tell them in

156
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:03,633
Go in please

157
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,754
Lie down Take off
your shirt and sock

158
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,828
How did it happened?

159
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:30,820
I have fell
twisted my ankle

160
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,601
Can you move the toes?

161
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,831
That's good

162
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:41,342
I haven't seen you
before, have I?

163
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:42,502
No

164
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,508
Does that hurt?

165
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,518
How long have you been
working at the quarry

166
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:54,455
Well, about
six months now

167
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:57,185
It's a sprain
Nothing serious

168
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,862
The Germans are
busy this morning

169
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:04,465
looking for
parachutists

170
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:06,200
Yes, we heard

171
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,203
Guess they've been
searching the whole area

172
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:10,637
I expect they were
up at the quarry

173
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:11,865
Oh yes

174
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,133
Yes the quarry would be a good place
for the parachutists to hide

175
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:20,080
But I doubt it they'll
get pretty far

176
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,648
Not now

177
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,317
Now no one might
shelter them

178
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:25,319
Not after murdering
those Germans

179
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,755
Everybody will be
too frightened

180
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:29,586
Put your finger
there, will you?

181
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:39,490
Stand up

182
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,278
That will do

183
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:53,614
I won't hesitate
to shoot

184
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,605
Sonia!

185
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,291
Yes, these are
the other two

186
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,799
You will forgive me?

187
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,735
We have to make sure you're not
spies planted by the Nazis

188
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,738
Welcome home

189
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,399
Oh God!

190
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,572
You bastard!

191
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,807
Adult education?

192
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,241
Come in Find a place

193
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,089
Good afternoon

194
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:50,257
For the benefit
of the those

195
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:52,492
who are entering for
the higher certificate,

196
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:56,485
today we are going to talk about
positive and negative ileums

197
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:22,778
You managed to convince our friends
and countries to your identity

198
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:25,388
Now you must
convince us

199
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:30,397
Miles isn't it? Come
a thousand miles to help

200
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:32,733
How do you mean
convincing?

201
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,401
We want proof

202
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:37,738
We don't carry papers signed by
Winston Church, if that's what you mean

203
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:41,731
What was the name of your
commanding officer in England

204
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:44,645
Answer the question

205
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:46,747
We are Czechs

206
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,482
We were born here and
we've come back to fight

207
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:50,317
and that's all
we're telling you

208
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:51,818
You say you're Czechs

209
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:55,422
Your home
where is it?

210
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:57,090
Vladaslov

211
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,426
I know Vladaslov

212
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:01,758
What's unusual about
the bridge there?

213
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:04,831
It doesn't exist

214
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,601
Huh? Why?

215
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:10,270
It was blown up in 39

216
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,373
Anyone could know that

217
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:15,773
I was a member of the group
that lay the explosives

218
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:21,281
There were three of us caught by
the Germans, I was one of them

219
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:23,545
Anyone could
say that too

220
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,302
Get dressed

221
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,585
So now you see...

222
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:02,578
We have both positive and
negative particles in the vacuole

223
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,619
Karel

224
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:47,067
Where did you
come from?

225
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:50,628
Don't ask me any questions
I... can't say anything

226
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:55,809
I knew you'd come

227
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,812
I knew it I knew it

228
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:02,805
I was a bit worried I'll
meet somebody else

229
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,313
How? I said I'll
wait and I meant it

230
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,421
I never dreamed

231
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:16,429
How long you can stay?

232
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:19,533
I don't know

233
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:22,102
Day? Week?

234
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,603
I don't know

235
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:26,037
I'll come to see whenever
I can I promise

236
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,141
See you in the morning

237
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:01,641
OK

238
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:03,233
- Good luck
- Thank you

239
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,452
I'm Curda

240
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,545
Mommy, he's here

241
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,726
Good evening
and welcome

242
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:53,793
Thank you

243
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,629
My daughter
Jundriska

244
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:56,730
I'm Karel

245
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,232
Call me aunt Marie
everyone does

246
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,300
I'll show you
to your room

247
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,069
Thank you

248
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:05,071
Oh... There's
just one thing

249
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:08,074
My husband works on the railways
and knows nothing of this

250
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:09,142
As far as he's
concerned

251
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,134
you are from the country and
looking for work in Prague, alright?

252
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:17,751
My son, Ata

253
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:20,587
- Hello
- He studied in the conservatory

254
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:21,655
I'll get you
something to eat

255
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:24,157
Thank you

256
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:27,594
Oh... When you wanna contact
your friends, you tell me

257
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:29,152
- OK
- OK

258
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,672
There are eight streets
leading off the square

259
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:42,108
Which one do you take if you
want to go to aunt Marie's?

260
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:44,678
One by the clock

261
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,509
And St. Nicholas
Cathedral

262
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:55,686
The next one
passed the clock

263
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:12,739
Walk straight past

264
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,474
Don't look side ways

265
00:31:14,474 --> 00:31:16,408
You've seen nothing

266
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:29,322
What's happening?

267
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:31,313
I don't know but
we mustn't stay...

268
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:37,660
Heydrich!

269
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,679
Come away please You
mustn't stand here

270
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:05,182
Josef

271
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:03,283
These are back up
I don't like it

272
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:04,684
Am I not right, eh?

273
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:06,286
You are right

274
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,787
It's funny in English

275
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:09,687
I desire my language

276
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:57,307
It's late

277
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:00,486
I didn't realize father

278
00:37:00,486 --> 00:37:01,587
All well with you?

279
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,489
As usual Is Karel in?

280
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:04,490
Yeah

281
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,082
Good night

282
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:24,777
You're very late, Carl

283
00:37:24,777 --> 00:37:26,446
I had a hard day

284
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:28,381
Panic from the
moment I went home

285
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:31,718
You should have
seen the chaos

286
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:34,120
Cattle trucks

287
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,789
The Germans want
every single one

288
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,125
Cattle trucks

289
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,295
God knows why

290
00:37:42,295 --> 00:37:46,288
On top of all that we got an order
for Heydrich's special train

291
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:49,567
He's going to Berlin
in three days

292
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,730
Heydrich

293
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:58,411
I knew it

294
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:00,480
I knew it was
something important

295
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,815
All those scooters
always works

296
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:05,151
Well?

297
00:38:05,151 --> 00:38:07,244
I don't know

298
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:11,591
I'm not sure

299
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:13,081
I have to
think about it

300
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:19,198
Perhaps we should wait for the
other parachutists to arrive

301
00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:22,602
No We can't
take the risk

302
00:38:22,602 --> 00:38:26,606
We have to do it the day
he leaves for Berlin

303
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:29,542
It might be the only
chance we get

304
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,043
Have you thought
what they will do

305
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:33,045
if you succeed
in killing him?

306
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:34,380
We have our orders

307
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,282
People who gave you those
orders are safe in London

308
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:37,617
They don't have to suffer
what that are priceless

309
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:40,052
Think what they
will do to this country

310
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:42,722
The world would
come down on our heads

311
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:45,124
It's a chance
we have to take

312
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:47,794
My God they send
us children

313
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:50,396
Do you imagine we didn't think
about assassinating Heydrich?

314
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:52,632
Why didn't you then?

315
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:55,401
Because we know the
consequences will be

316
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,737
We are soldiers
This is a war

317
00:38:57,737 --> 00:38:59,728
If you won't help
us we'll do it alone

318
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:04,477
We never said we
would not help you

319
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:06,412
What do you
want us to do?

320
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:09,074
Where is the best
place to kill him?

321
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,470
It's coming

322
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:02,174
So our beloved Führertics
takes time off

323
00:44:02,174 --> 00:44:05,277
from the heads of state
to welcome to Berlin

324
00:44:05,277 --> 00:44:08,114
one of the man who was helping
him in the glorious task

325
00:44:08,114 --> 00:44:09,682
of governing
the third life

326
00:44:09,682 --> 00:44:12,618
SS Overcopen Führer
Reinhard Heydrich

327
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:15,382
Rights protector of
Bohemia and Bohevia

328
00:44:16,622 --> 00:44:20,114
Icefuraskis him love watches
as the presentations are made

329
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:24,463
The Führer and his two
most trusted advisors

330
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:28,300
are to meet in secret conference
at Reich Chancellor in Berlin

331
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,804
before the Führer leaves for
the ceremony at Vegetor's Garden

332
00:44:31,804 --> 00:44:34,140
Decorate out
victorious generals

333
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,077
who have brought honor and glory
to the third life and to the Führer

334
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:40,246
We should have stopped
that other train

335
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:42,806
God if only we can get
accurate information

336
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:47,319
We've got to send those
man from London now

337
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:51,312
Wireless operators to set up
a communications network

338
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,261
Lose of time and energy
and thought and for what?

339
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:56,595
Killing

340
00:44:56,595 --> 00:44:58,264
Christ
we are young

341
00:44:58,264 --> 00:45:01,097
We should be out
enjoying ourselves

342
00:45:03,502 --> 00:45:06,835
If it was peace time
suddenly... now

343
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:10,270
What would you do?

344
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:17,383
I'd go out and
buy a dress

345
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:21,376
A bright red
dress made of silk

346
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:24,290
I'd see a good
football match

347
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,725
Maybe get drunk
afterwards

348
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:30,718
Parties, dancing!

349
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:34,233
It's bad luck to
be over age

350
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:37,469
Yes, bad luck

351
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:39,805
Oh, don't bother to
iron on the back

352
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:42,296
Nobody sees

353
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:49,146
Dance with me?

354
00:45:57,156 --> 00:45:59,658
I... I don't know how to

355
00:45:59,658 --> 00:46:01,594
You don't know
how to dance?

356
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:03,762
No I never
had the chance

357
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,423
Never?

358
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:52,805
Shouldn't you
be leaving?

359
00:47:52,805 --> 00:47:54,466
It's late

360
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:02,470
He's getting
use to you

361
00:50:36,602 --> 00:50:38,604
The messages arrived
from Berlin

362
00:50:38,604 --> 00:50:41,437
which I've been
authorized to translate

363
00:50:42,508 --> 00:50:44,510
For the duration
of war emergency

364
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,779
I hereby appoint you
commissioner and protector

365
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:51,350
for all occupied
territories in Europe

366
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:55,343
Arrange your affairs in order to
arrive in Berlin without delay

367
00:50:56,622 --> 00:50:58,613
Adolf Hitler

368
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:06,625
- Thursday... Are you sure?
- I'm sure

369
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,293
What's happening?

370
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:09,294
Next thursday

371
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:11,797
He didn't give
us much time

372
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:13,632
He must give us time

373
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:14,733
We'll use one to
the New Post

374
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:17,293
No no Curda is right
It's too dangerous

375
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,472
That's for us
to decide

376
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:24,409
It's not for
you to decide

377
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:28,313
There are too many
Czech lives at stake

378
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:30,415
I am gonna stop this

379
00:52:30,415 --> 00:52:33,318
I am gonna
notify London

380
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:36,421
London's orders were
perfectly clear

381
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:39,424
Kill Heydrich
at all costs

382
00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:41,593
We've been here weeks

383
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:43,829
Well I think it's
only in four days

384
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:47,162
Perhaps it's because we've
been looking for a safe way

385
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:51,169
Maybe we're going to
have to risk everything

386
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:53,171
What do you
mean everything?

387
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:55,340
Something we've been thinking
about for some time

388
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,609
He rises at 7 AM

389
00:52:57,609 --> 00:53:01,346
Breakfast, bathes and he's
dressed by his valet

390
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:05,339
7:45 precisely, he usually
says goodbye to his daughter,

391
00:53:05,517 --> 00:53:09,510
gets into his Mercedes, which
is driven by a Chauffeur Glen

392
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:13,624
When the car proceeds
down the drive

393
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:17,129
he's escorted by
armed troop carrier

394
00:53:17,129 --> 00:53:20,465
one jeep and
an armored car

395
00:53:20,465 --> 00:53:24,458
The convoy travels very slowly
at about 40 miles per hour

396
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:28,473
The first part of the journey
is through the country side

397
00:53:28,473 --> 00:53:31,310
Tree lined roads
and small villages,

398
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:35,147
along order of specially constructed
to take him into Prague

399
00:53:35,147 --> 00:53:39,140
He enters the out skirt of
the Prague at this point here

400
00:53:42,487 --> 00:53:45,650
Proceeds around the bended
Vulsavitcha junction

401
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:56,590
And then enters Harry Channy
castle at 8:05 AM precisely

402
00:53:57,669 --> 00:54:01,106
And he's been doing the
same thing every day without fail

403
00:54:01,106 --> 00:54:04,109
It never varies

404
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:05,667
What do you think Jan?

405
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:15,554
There's only one place

406
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:17,055
Here

407
00:54:17,055 --> 00:54:20,225
We kill him there as he comes
around Vulsavitcha junction

408
00:54:20,225 --> 00:54:23,128
But he's heavily
guarded all the time

409
00:54:23,128 --> 00:54:25,063
He slows down

410
00:54:25,063 --> 00:54:26,631
You are gonna
stand there?

411
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:29,735
Pointing your guns a few
feet from Heydrich,

412
00:54:29,735 --> 00:54:31,636
in full view of
his escort?

413
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:33,405
We'll never get
away with it

414
00:54:33,405 --> 00:54:35,574
It's the only place

415
00:54:35,574 --> 00:54:37,565
It's suicide

416
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:36,425
Run!

417
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,398
Alright, you two!

418
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:16,568
Pick him up, put him in the
back of the bakers land

419
01:02:16,568 --> 01:02:19,804
Come on!

420
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:22,295
Be careful

421
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:26,735
Easy, easy

422
01:02:50,668 --> 01:02:53,102
Vlavika hospital quickly

423
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:10,773
I said it was impossible
we should never even have tried

424
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:21,392
It's on the radio
he's still alive

425
01:04:21,392 --> 01:04:24,384
They are offering reward of
ten million crowns

426
01:04:38,142 --> 01:04:40,133
It jammed

427
01:04:41,813 --> 01:04:43,474
I had him!

428
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:48,143
I had him!

429
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,836
Mommy, have you
seen my bicycle?

430
01:05:04,836 --> 01:05:08,673
Oh Christ, I left it
outside of Kinsles

431
01:05:08,673 --> 01:05:10,775
Quickly Jundriska get it
and bring it back here

432
01:05:10,775 --> 01:05:12,210
No I must go

433
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:15,713
No go alone Jundriska
it's safer

434
01:05:15,713 --> 01:05:17,548
Hundreds of splinters
from the grenade...

435
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:20,118
penetrated deeply into
the lumbar region

436
01:05:20,118 --> 01:05:22,220
We removed
what we could

437
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:26,213
but his spleen and kidneys
are seriously damaged

438
01:05:27,558 --> 01:05:29,227
But much more dangerous

439
01:05:29,227 --> 01:05:31,129
is the fine splinters
of horse hair

440
01:05:31,129 --> 01:05:34,799
and material from the car upholstery
had entered the blood stream

441
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,635
We may have to
operate again

442
01:05:37,635 --> 01:05:39,804
No you are not
to touch him

443
01:05:39,804 --> 01:05:40,738
But dear Frank?

444
01:05:40,738 --> 01:05:44,401
The Führer's own surgeons are
coming Keep him alive until then

445
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:47,073
But if blood
poisoning sets in?

446
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:39,230
Oh father of mercy

447
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:43,223
We pray to thee for thy
servant Reinhard Heydrich

448
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:48,061
We remember now who lord his
qualities of his leadership

449
01:06:48,406 --> 01:06:51,242
his sense of service

450
01:06:51,242 --> 01:06:55,235
the inspiration he has
been to all the people

451
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,081
And we pray

452
01:06:57,081 --> 01:07:00,084
that he may long
continue to lead

453
01:07:00,084 --> 01:07:04,077
to serve and
to inspire

454
01:07:04,589 --> 01:07:05,578
Amen

455
01:07:26,277 --> 01:07:28,546
It is only these two?

456
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:31,782
Oh...
sort of...

457
01:07:31,782 --> 01:07:34,051
What do you
mean sort of?

458
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:35,620
Is it or isn't it?

459
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,788
How many will
there be?

460
01:07:37,788 --> 01:07:41,724
Three...
four...?

461
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:46,227
Seven?

462
01:08:01,746 --> 01:08:04,476
- We must go
- Where's Curda?

463
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:07,579
He should have been
here hours ago

464
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:12,190
We have to leave
without him

465
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,592
But we can't leave
without Curda

466
01:08:14,592 --> 01:08:17,195
The longer you stay here
more dangerous it is

467
01:08:17,195 --> 01:08:18,429
You'll have to go

468
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:21,766
No I am sorry We can't
leave without him

469
01:08:21,766 --> 01:08:23,768
Listen to Janak

470
01:08:23,768 --> 01:08:27,371
It's too risky

471
01:08:27,371 --> 01:08:30,608
Talk to him, make
him see sense

472
01:08:30,608 --> 01:08:33,611
Nope, I'm with Jan

473
01:08:33,611 --> 01:08:37,281
Three of us landed together
we are gonna stay together

474
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:39,116
We wait

475
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:41,719
How long for god's sake?

476
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:44,279
We'll give him...
12 hours?

477
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:41,605
Now state secretary
Frank salutes

478
01:10:41,605 --> 01:10:43,674
He has vowed to root
out the criminals

479
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:46,510
who are responsible
for this crime

480
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:50,503
Anyone who assisted them or fail to
give information will be executed

481
01:10:51,182 --> 01:10:54,117
They and their families
until justice is done

482
01:10:57,455 --> 01:10:59,690
Now it is the turn of
proud Heydrich

483
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:03,294
Her face failed to kneel
and kiss the flag

484
01:11:03,294 --> 01:11:06,530
She steps back as the six officers
take up their positions

485
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,866
either side of
the gun carriage

486
01:11:08,866 --> 01:11:12,393
The coffin is raised
the command is given

487
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:16,073
Escort comes to attention

488
01:11:16,073 --> 01:11:19,243
and the sad prosecution makes
its way towards the train

489
01:11:19,243 --> 01:11:21,645
Karel

490
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:23,636
I never lost you for
anything have I?

491
01:11:27,084 --> 01:11:28,642
Don't go now
please?

492
01:11:31,088 --> 01:11:33,324
No I wouldn't

493
01:11:33,324 --> 01:11:34,757
I won't ever
leave you

494
01:11:37,762 --> 01:11:41,163
Where he would be laid to rest
in presence of the Führer

495
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,168
Liditz

496
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:45,430
Liditz?

497
01:12:15,566 --> 01:12:19,468
When he came from the office of
the acting rights protector

498
01:12:20,471 --> 01:12:24,464
In the course of the search for
the murderers of Heydrich

499
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:29,803
it was found that the population
of village of Liditz

500
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:34,084
approximately 20 kilometers
northwest of Prague

501
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:38,077
had helped and cooperated with
the perpetrates of this crime

502
01:12:40,324 --> 01:12:44,261
Accordingly a detachment of
SS division Prikcks Barugie

503
01:12:44,261 --> 01:12:48,254
commanded by SS Overstune
Van Führer Max Roshnov

504
01:12:48,432 --> 01:12:51,424
was dispatched
for Liditz at dawn

505
01:13:10,354 --> 01:13:12,223
All the man have
been shot,

506
01:13:12,223 --> 01:13:15,125
women deported to
concentration camps,

507
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:19,129
the children sent to appropriate
houses for re-education

508
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:22,466
All the buildings of this
village have been destroyed

509
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:26,459
and the name of the village
removed from the land register

510
01:13:27,304 --> 01:13:31,308
The village of Liditz
has seized to exist

511
01:13:31,308 --> 01:13:34,471
And it's name will never
again appear on any map

512
01:16:19,443 --> 01:16:22,546
Come I'll take
you to the others

513
01:16:22,546 --> 01:16:26,539
Father, I want
to confess

514
01:16:48,572 --> 01:16:51,408
I confess father
to murder

515
01:16:51,408 --> 01:16:54,078
Mass murder

516
01:16:54,078 --> 01:16:57,138
The people of Liditz
I am responsible

517
01:16:58,315 --> 01:17:01,418
How were you
responsible?

518
01:17:01,418 --> 01:17:03,754
I killed Heydrich

519
01:17:03,754 --> 01:17:06,154
What happened to Liditz
is because of that

520
01:17:11,261 --> 01:17:13,430
You are wrong

521
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:17,423
By that crackening, I am
just as responsible

522
01:17:17,701 --> 01:17:21,105
Simply for harboring
you here

523
01:17:21,105 --> 01:17:24,541
No, but at war...

524
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:27,544
War is the
greatest evil

525
01:17:27,544 --> 01:17:31,537
In war, no man could hold himself
responsible for the sins of his enemy

526
01:17:32,282 --> 01:17:34,384
But Father

527
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:36,443
I can't help
I feel it

528
01:17:38,455 --> 01:17:41,725
I'll give you a penance
if it's penance you want

529
01:17:41,725 --> 01:17:45,286
Anything father
anything

530
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:58,742
Learn to forgive
your enemy

531
01:17:58,742 --> 01:18:02,079
Pray for them Jan

532
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:03,747
Pray for them

533
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:06,477
and for the souls
of the departed

534
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:14,356
I forgive you in the name of
the father and of the son

535
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:18,085
and of the holy
ghost, Amen

536
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,550
Hi, Josef

537
01:18:45,222 --> 01:18:47,558
Hello

538
01:18:47,558 --> 01:18:51,551
- Hello, Josef
- Hi

539
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:53,397
Isn't Curda with you?

540
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:54,731
No

541
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:57,131
We couldn't
wait any longer

542
01:19:43,714 --> 01:19:46,049
I've got some
information

543
01:19:46,049 --> 01:19:48,118
Yeah?

544
01:19:48,118 --> 01:19:50,552
About the rights
protector

545
01:19:56,727 --> 01:19:59,127
Sit down over there

546
01:20:18,582 --> 01:20:20,584
I got some
cheese for you

547
01:20:20,584 --> 01:20:22,245
Thank you

548
01:20:25,422 --> 01:20:28,325
It could be one guess

549
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:30,160
Don't tell me
don't tell me

550
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,755
- Yeah, sausages
- Sausages

551
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:41,838
Good news

552
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:44,773
Yeah, four aces

553
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:49,846
You'll be out of
here in 24 hours

554
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:53,517
The R.A.F. Is sending a plane
they've given us map reference

555
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:55,285
Marvelous!

556
01:20:55,285 --> 01:20:57,621
You have to be out
of here by day break

557
01:20:57,621 --> 01:21:01,458
We'll make all the
necessary arrangements

558
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:03,794
I want to ask a favor.

559
01:21:03,794 --> 01:21:06,285
I want to go out this
afternoon, Janak

560
01:21:08,198 --> 01:21:10,189
I need to meet Anna

561
01:21:11,702 --> 01:21:13,636
It's only for an hour

562
01:21:15,405 --> 01:21:16,406
Alright

563
01:21:16,406 --> 01:21:18,075
Good

564
01:21:18,075 --> 01:21:22,079
Have her meet me on the embankment
of Charles bridge at 2:30

565
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:23,808
Thank you

566
01:21:25,315 --> 01:21:28,151
Ata, you prepare to bring
in some provisions tonight

567
01:21:28,151 --> 01:21:29,252
OK

568
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:31,421
Yeah, and champagne
and some caviar

569
01:21:31,421 --> 01:21:33,651
we'll have ourselves
a bonvoyage project

570
01:21:36,093 --> 01:21:37,651
Come this way

571
01:22:12,129 --> 01:22:14,231
Name?

572
01:22:14,231 --> 01:22:15,632
Karel Curda

573
01:22:15,632 --> 01:22:18,068
Occupation?

574
01:22:18,068 --> 01:22:22,061
I'm parachutist
dropped by the R.A.F.

575
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:26,571
I understand you wish
to make a statement

576
01:22:27,411 --> 01:22:28,645
Yes

577
01:22:28,645 --> 01:22:30,747
You realize that
whatever you tell us

578
01:22:30,747 --> 01:22:33,648
may not have the
value you put on it

579
01:22:36,253 --> 01:22:40,246
I am a member of the group
that killed Heydrich

580
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:44,161
and I can identify
the others

581
01:22:44,161 --> 01:22:46,096
First you must give
me an insurance

582
01:22:46,096 --> 01:22:50,100
But before we make a...
let's say bargains,

583
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,436
we must find out
what you know

584
01:22:52,436 --> 01:22:55,338
then we will see

585
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:56,339
Oh

586
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:58,330
Please sit down

587
01:23:06,349 --> 01:23:08,452
Who are these men?

588
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:10,353
Can you give us
their names?

589
01:23:10,353 --> 01:23:11,688
Where they are hiding?

590
01:23:11,688 --> 01:23:15,624
Josef Gabcik, Jan Kubis
We were dropped together

591
01:23:19,296 --> 01:23:21,565
Why are you
telling us this?

592
01:23:21,565 --> 01:23:24,301
Is it for the reward?

593
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:28,305
I want to protect
my family

594
01:23:28,305 --> 01:23:32,298
I don't want my wife
and child shot, please

595
01:23:56,433 --> 01:23:57,667
What do you think
you could tell us

596
01:23:57,667 --> 01:24:00,659
about what's found at the
scene of assassination?

597
01:24:13,717 --> 01:24:17,053
This one is Gabcik's

598
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:19,222
Carried his
stun gun in here

599
01:24:19,222 --> 01:24:22,392
Where are these two men?

600
01:24:22,392 --> 01:24:25,228
I don't know Hiding
in Prague somewhere

601
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:28,131
You'll have to do
better than that

602
01:24:28,131 --> 01:24:29,132
Where are they?

603
01:24:29,132 --> 01:24:31,225
I don't know

604
01:24:48,318 --> 01:24:50,479
Mr. Curda

605
01:24:51,655 --> 01:24:54,419
How old is your child?

606
01:25:28,725 --> 01:25:30,060
Who is it?

607
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,620
It's alright
I'll get it

608
01:25:48,812 --> 01:25:51,246
Raise your hands, turn
your face to the wall

609
01:25:55,085 --> 01:25:56,753
What... what
do you want?

610
01:25:56,753 --> 01:25:58,588
Where are they?

611
01:25:58,588 --> 01:26:01,658
What are you doing?
Tell them to stop

612
01:26:01,658 --> 01:26:04,160
I want to know
where they are

613
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,162
Who? Who're you
talking about?

614
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:08,498
Kubis and Gabcik

615
01:26:08,498 --> 01:26:11,601
Assassins
where are they?

616
01:26:11,601 --> 01:26:14,704
Assassins...
there's no one here

617
01:26:14,704 --> 01:26:18,108
Only my wife

618
01:26:18,108 --> 01:26:19,776
Just take me

619
01:26:19,776 --> 01:26:21,607
My husband know
nothing about it

620
01:26:23,046 --> 01:26:24,775
Hey Blashure!

621
01:26:36,293 --> 01:26:37,783
I am sorry

622
01:27:06,423 --> 01:27:07,657
Mommy

623
01:27:07,657 --> 01:27:10,160
Quickly, you
must warn Ata

624
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,494
Go to the
conservator

625
01:27:11,494 --> 01:27:13,196
Tell him he
must not go home

626
01:27:13,196 --> 01:27:15,098
He's to go straight
to the crypt

627
01:27:15,098 --> 01:27:17,362
and you...
Hurry up!

628
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,374
What's the matter?

629
01:27:24,374 --> 01:27:27,377
I haven't any money
for the traffic

630
01:27:27,377 --> 01:27:29,277
There

631
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,090
Mama!

632
01:28:39,115 --> 01:28:40,548
Jundriska!

633
01:28:42,285 --> 01:28:44,048
Papa!

634
01:29:01,404 --> 01:29:03,463
My Evil-

635
01:29:28,097 --> 01:29:31,100
Just tell me
where they are

636
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,602
Why protect them?

637
01:29:32,602 --> 01:29:34,593
Why be so obstinate?

638
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:59,785
You are music
student, I see

639
01:30:00,063 --> 01:30:02,463
Ah yes, you play
the violin

640
01:30:28,324 --> 01:30:29,759
We are leaving
at day break

641
01:30:29,759 --> 01:30:31,427
I know

642
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:32,762
The war will be
over someday

643
01:30:32,762 --> 01:30:34,597
I'll be back

644
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:36,666
Stay with me

645
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:38,434
I can't

646
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:39,435
I'll hide you.

647
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:42,272
You'll be safe We'll leave
Prague and go somewhere else

648
01:30:42,272 --> 01:30:45,341
Anna, it's
not possible

649
01:30:45,341 --> 01:30:46,672
Why?

650
01:30:48,278 --> 01:30:50,109
Try and think
of afterwards

651
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:53,783
That's what I do

652
01:30:53,783 --> 01:30:55,614
When it's over I
think of coming back

653
01:30:57,787 --> 01:30:59,789
Seeing you again

654
01:30:59,789 --> 01:31:03,459
I wish I knew you better
I wish we had more time

655
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:06,796
You're right We don't
know each other at all

656
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:08,865
I know nothing
about you Anna

657
01:31:08,865 --> 01:31:10,628
You don't even
know my real name

658
01:31:13,069 --> 01:31:14,730
It's not important

659
01:31:20,243 --> 01:31:22,412
I never did get
that red dress

660
01:31:22,412 --> 01:31:26,405
No, I never saw
a football match

661
01:31:40,163 --> 01:31:41,596
Curda?

662
01:31:47,837 --> 01:31:50,601
It's pleased to
see you Curda

663
01:31:54,177 --> 01:31:56,441
I... I didn't tell them

664
01:31:57,513 --> 01:32:01,347
about the church...
I didn't tell him

665
01:32:03,286 --> 01:32:05,788
What church Ata?

666
01:32:05,788 --> 01:32:09,781
Sunsils, at the
Slover street

667
01:32:10,126 --> 01:32:12,390
I... I didn't
tell them

668
01:32:13,563 --> 01:32:16,555
I didn't... l...
I didn't tell them

669
01:32:55,838 --> 01:32:57,669
Come back soon

670
01:33:32,809 --> 01:33:35,243
Jan

671
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,481
What happened?

672
01:33:38,481 --> 01:33:39,413
My mother's...

673
01:34:07,844 --> 01:34:09,607
There's nothing
for you here

674
01:35:19,282 --> 01:35:20,613
Kubis

675
01:35:22,285 --> 01:35:22,785
Lieutenant!

676
01:35:22,785 --> 01:35:25,276
- What's the matter?
- They found us

677
01:35:41,404 --> 01:35:43,472
The street is
swarming with them

678
01:35:43,472 --> 01:35:44,574
How did they find us?

679
01:35:44,574 --> 01:35:45,408
Who the hell talked?

680
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,243
What difference
does it make?

681
01:35:47,243 --> 01:35:48,144
Hundreds of them

682
01:35:48,144 --> 01:35:49,645
I could've warn
the others

683
01:35:49,645 --> 01:35:52,248
No, there
isn't time

684
01:35:52,248 --> 01:35:54,739
- Bahtz take cover Bubrich
- follow me

685
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:20,599
Father Patrek?

686
01:36:24,113 --> 01:36:26,377
Father Patrek?

687
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:47,129
Give me a hand

688
01:37:47,129 --> 01:37:48,562
The passage!

689
01:37:51,133 --> 01:37:53,465
Father Patrek thought it
might lead to the river

690
01:38:00,743 --> 01:38:02,734
At least this must go
onto the street

691
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:38,758
They are re-grouping

692
01:40:51,514 --> 01:40:54,347
Jesus christ there's
more bastards up there

693
01:43:19,128 --> 01:43:21,221
Alright, who are
these men?

694
01:43:59,268 --> 01:44:05,507
Are these the
assassins?

695
01:44:05,507 --> 01:44:06,608
No

696
01:44:06,608 --> 01:44:10,601
Who are they then?

697
01:44:10,779 --> 01:44:13,115
Bach...

698
01:44:13,115 --> 01:44:15,718
Bubrich

699
01:44:15,718 --> 01:44:17,447
and Korel

700
01:44:19,788 --> 01:44:21,623
They were
dropped after us

701
01:44:21,623 --> 01:44:23,454
Where are the others?

702
01:44:34,403 --> 01:44:36,472
Come on! It's
our only chance

703
01:44:36,472 --> 01:44:37,573
It's hopeless

704
01:44:37,573 --> 01:44:38,807
The priest was wrong

705
01:44:38,807 --> 01:44:41,139
There is no passage

706
01:45:13,108 --> 01:45:14,541
Here it is

707
01:47:06,588 --> 01:47:08,317
Tell him to
surrender

708
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,361
Jan!

709
01:47:22,704 --> 01:47:24,763
Josef!

710
01:47:26,441 --> 01:47:29,274
Josef, give up!
It's useless

711
01:47:54,136 --> 01:47:55,068
Here!

712
01:49:37,706 --> 01:49:40,776
Josef, Jan!

713
01:49:40,776 --> 01:49:42,539
Listen!

714
01:50:45,507 --> 01:50:47,843
Jusech, help Josef
go up the stairs

715
01:50:47,843 --> 01:50:50,107
Go on!

716
01:51:25,747 --> 01:51:27,305
Josef!

717
01:55:39,634 --> 01:55:41,736
How many you got?

718
01:55:41,736 --> 01:55:43,135
Enough

719
01:56:36,724 --> 01:56:39,561
It's all over
move out

720
01:56:39,561 --> 01:56:41,552
Move out
it's all over
