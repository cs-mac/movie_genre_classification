1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,900
 

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,200
 

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,700
 

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,400
<i>Mr. Adams.</i>

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,800
<i>- Mr. Adams.
- Yes!</i>

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,500
 

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,700
<i>- Man: mr. Adams, sir.
- Yes!</i>

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,700
 

9
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,900
Momentous news, mr. Adams.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,300
The british are defeated.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,700
Look.

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,100


13
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,900
Now,
sir--

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,900
Now, sir, all will be fine.

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,300
All will be fine, sir.

16
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,900
 

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,100
Come.  Come now.

18
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,800
You have struck a great blow

19
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,200
For the american cause, mr. Adams.

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,800
You have turned us all on our heads.

21
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,000
General Washington, at yorktown
did the substance of the work.

22
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,400
Only the form belongs to me.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Our directors have agreed

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,100
To an initial loan of

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,900
5 million
dutch guilders--

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,600
<i>2 million of your
american dollars--</i>

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,500
At a special rate

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,800
Of 5% interest.

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,400
You may consider american credit

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,600
Fully established.

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Well,
i--

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
Well, I thank you, gentlemen.

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,400
I thank you very very much indeed.

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,200
 

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,800
We are very sorry to hear

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,300
That you will leave us so soon.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh yes, well, I am
needed in paris again.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,500
<i>The british have sued for peace,</i>

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
And I intend to see
that we have a treaty

40
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,700
That recognizes our
independence, nothing less.

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,500
You are a most stubborn man, mr. Adams.

42
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,400
Ah, well, thanks be to god
he gave me stubbornness,

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,600
Especially when I know that I am right.

44
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,700
 

45
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,000
 

46
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
<i>John: "my dearest friend,</i>

47
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,400
<i>The peace treaty is done</i>

48
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,200
<i>But the congress have
instructed me to remain in paris</i>

49
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,800
<i>To secure commerce with other nations.</i>

50
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,700
<i>I cannot justify going home,</i>

51
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,100
<i>But what should I do
for want of my Abigail?</i>

52
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,000
<i>There is only one remedy:</i>

53
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,600
<i>Come, my dearest friend.</i>

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,400
<i>Make all arrangements you must</i>

55
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
<i>For the care and
education of our children.</i>

56
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,900
<i>They are old enough now.</i>

57
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,500
<i>Come, my friend."</i>

58
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,400
<i>Madame.</i>

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
Auteuil?

60
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,800
<i>Auteuil, madame, oui.</i>

61
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Adams?

62
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
<i>Monsieur adams a auteuil.</i>

63
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,300
<i>Oui, madame. Bienvenu.</i>

64
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,300
 

65
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,500
<i>Madame.</i>

66
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,400
Mrs. Adams.

67
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,800
Mr. Adams.

68
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Come.

69
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,700
I've taken the liberty of
making this room into my office.

70
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,000
This is not in use.

71
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,400
 

72
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,700
 

73
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,300
I came here

74
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,000
With many harsh words for you, John.

75
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,500
I know you have complained,

76
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,300
And it is very well-Deserved.

77
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,800


78
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Not because you were
absent from my thoughts,

79
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
But...

80
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,100
Because you were too much in them.

81
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,400
To write of my disgrace,

82
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,100
To burden you with my trials here,

83
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,900
Knowing of all of those you had to face

84
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
At home

85
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,600
Alone...

86
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
It sorrows me more than I can say

87
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,700
To think that I may have added to them.

88
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,100
Can you forgive me, Abigail?

89
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,500
Did you think that i
would think less of you

90
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,400
If you spoke of your misadventures here?

91
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,400
No man wants to appear
a fool before his wife.

92
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,900
And now that you are triumphant,

93
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,300
Can you open your heart to me again?

94
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,700
And now my heart was are
triunever closed to you.

95
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,900
Without you to steady me,

96
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,800
Without you

97
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,700
I...

98
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,300
I dismiss my god, I grow weak

99
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,200
And vain.

100
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,900
Then we shall have to relieve
you of such bad habits.

101
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,700
You must stay with me always...

102
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,000
To prevent my ruination.

103
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,500
Jefferson: I understood my role

104
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,500
Was to negotiate free-Trade agreements

105
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,900
With anyone that would listen.

106
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,100
But nobody seems to have
the slightest interest

107
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,400
In either me or my whale oil.

108
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,000
 

109
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Well, there is a lack

110
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,500
Of confidence
in us, Thomas--

111
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
In the whale
oil, perhaps--

112
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
But in the country as a whole.

113
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,200
Do they think that we
will tire of independence?

114
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,600
That our nation is...

115
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,600
Ephemeral?

116
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,400
My experience here has shown

117
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,900
That american affairs are
of very little consequence

118
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
To anyone in europe.

119
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,100
And as long as they are
dealing with 13 separate states,

120
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,900
They can afford to procrastinate.

121
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,800
Ah!

122
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,900
Thomas, allow me to present my wife.

123
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,800
Mrs. Adams is already well known to me.

124
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,400
Your wisdom and your
passion for your country

125
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,900
Is said to inform your
husband's every decision.

126
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,500
 

127
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,600
You do me more credit
than I deserve, sir.

128
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,300
Come.

129
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Tell me, mr. Jefferson,

130
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,100
Are you situated in an
equally grand manner?

131
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,900
Oh, certainly. It's a measure of our
immense significance in the french court,

132
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,300
Where the question is not
how well-Qualified are we

133
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,700
For office, but how many
domestics do we retain.

134
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,600
The british ambassador has 50.
The spanish ambassador has 75.

135
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,400
We consider ourselves
quite impoverished.

136
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,200
We have to make do with fewer than 20.

137
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm sorry, my dear.

138
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,300
Perhaps if we had more servants,

139
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,800
You would be more successful
in your negotiations.

140
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,900
A diplomatic magician.

141
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,400
 

142
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,000
At present I see
scarcely any opportunity

143
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,000
Of doing anything for
the american public

144
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,800
Worth the expense of
maintaining us here.

145
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,300
Mr. Adams, did you invite
your wife across the atlantic

146
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,700
In order to complain
about our business affairs?

147
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,400
Uh, yes, of course I did.

148
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,300
 

149
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,900
I am most used to mr. Adams'
complaints, mr. Jefferson,

150
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,000
On either side of the atlantic.

151
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,700
I'm sure you are, but I for one am

152
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,100
Much more interested in hearing about

153
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,000
Your first impressions of france.

154
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,800
Well, I have been in france
for such a short time.

155
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,900
It would be unfair to pass sentence

156
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
Or form judgment.

157
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,600
Which implies that
you've already done both.

158
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,900
Well, if I had, mr. Jefferson,

159
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,600
I would only offer them
after my further experience

160
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,000
Had shown my wisdom or
the error of my ways.

161
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,300
An admirable caution.

162
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,600
Yes, and highly
uncharacteristic, I assure you.

163
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,900
I am sorry I will not have the
opportunity to meet your children.

164
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,200
As am i, mr. Jefferson.

165
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,600
Johnny has returned and he's
very well along at harvard.

166
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,800
So, uh...

167
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,400
It would not do to distract him.

168
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,700
Let me take this
opportunity, mr. Jefferson, to

169
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,900
Give you my deepest condolences.

170
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,200
You must know that you are
welcome here at any time.

171
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,200
I hope you will use
this as your second home.

172
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,800
You are most gracious. Thank you.

173
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,200
If ever there was a city designed
to distract us from our troubles,

174
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,800
It would be paris.

175
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,000
Good heavens.

176
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
I fear I make an awkward sight.

177
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,900
Oh, no. Without doubt,

178
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,200
You are the fairest
creature in christendom.

179
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,500
It would mortify my soul if i
should be thought to disgrace you.

180
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,100
My dear, you are like
to dazzle them all.

181
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,400
 

182
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,800
I confess I was ashamed
to be seen looking at them.

183
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,100
I am not accustomed to seeing
such intimacy on display.

184
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,600
 

185
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,200
Well, you seemed quite transported.

186
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
- I was.
- Yeah.

187
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,200
I am embarrassed to admit it.

188
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,100
I am resolved to renounce embarrassment

189
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,400
In favor of enjoyment

190
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,200
And a certain elevation of the spirits

191
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,900
Which is occasioned by
witnessing the human body

192
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,000
Liberated from its earthly shackles.

193
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,100
Paris is unique.

194
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Yes, and best enjoyed
in the company of women.

195
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,700
Women would add interest to
many things, mr. Jefferson,

196
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
If men would allow it.

197
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,000
Well, that has been my
experience, s. Adams.

198
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,200
I cannot imagine
monticello without martha.

199
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,200
I cannot imagine

200
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,800
Losing a child and
your wife in one year.

201
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,800
Perhaps the art of life is
the art of avoiding pain.

202
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,800
He is the best pilot who steers clear

203
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,800
Of the rocks and shoals.

204
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
For all of mr. Jefferson's sadness,

205
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,900
There is a great charm about him.

206
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,800
You find him a captivating man, hmm?

207
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,900
He is exceptional.

208
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,400
And am I not exceptional in any way?

209
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,200
Certainly,

210
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,500
Unless you are given
to one of your moods.

211
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm simply reading a book, madam.

212
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,500
<i>Pauline, merci.</i>

213
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,400
Madame.

214
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,100
All this fuss is really quite silly.

215
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,400
I'm perfectly capable of
brushing out my own hair.

216
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Protest if you will, my dear.

217
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,700
The question is whether
it is possible for a lady,

218
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,000
Or even a charming and exceptional man,

219
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,200
Once they have become accustomed
to the manners of europe,

220
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,100
Not to have their little
heads turned by them.

221
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,500
Well, if I am to have a
litany of all my faults,

222
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,000
Then perhaps we should just have it out

223
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,300
And be done with it.

224
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,700
 

225
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,200
John.

226
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,600
John.

227
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,100
Petulant John.

228
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,400
Exceptional John.

229
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,000
- Sleepy John?
- Mmm.

230
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,200
I would not change a
single thing about you.

231
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,400
Good thing for you!

232
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,600
<i>Man: le dr. Franklin, messieurs,</i>

233
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,400
<i>Et la comtesse ligniville d'autricourt.</i>

234
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I have something very
important to deliver.

235
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,200
When I can find it i
will know where it is.

236
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,400
Excellent, excellent.

237
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,500
Madame.

238
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,200
My stones!

239
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,900
Ahem.

240
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,800
Oh, pardon me, mrs. Adams.

241
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,500
It is mrs. Adams, is it not?

242
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,100
It is of course, doctor, yes.

243
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,800
Oh, an honor.

244
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Madam, I shall rise

245
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,200
To apologize for not getting up.

246
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,300
Dr. Franklin.

247
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,200
May I present the comtesse
ligniville d'autricourt,

248
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,300
Madame helvetius?

249
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,500
- Madame.
- Madame.

250
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Franklin asks me to
marry him many times.

251
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,300
Has he indeed?

252
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,600
An inconvenience to
mrs. Franklin, surely.

253
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,800
It is quite tiresome.

254
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,600
I tell him we are too old for romance.

255
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,400
<i>Found it!</i>

256
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,700
From Philadelphia.

257
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,700
<i>Merci.</i>

258
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,200
 

259
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,100
The congress has seen
fit to appoint me minister

260
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,800
To the court of st. James.

261
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,500
I am expected to appear in london

262
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,700
No later than king George's birthday.

263
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,400
Bravo!

264
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,800
Ambassador adams, may
you be the first of many.

265
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,700
Mrs. Ambassador.

266
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,200
We have had our disagreements.

267
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,300
 

268
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,000
But you have always been
an honest collaborator.

269
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,100
I can think of no better choice

270
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,000
To represent the united states

271
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
In great britain than yourself.

272
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,700
The english love an insult.

273
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,100
It's their only test
of a man's sincerity.

274
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,800
Ah. Ahh!

275
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,400
 

276
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,600
My own days abroad are at a close,

277
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,900
But mr. Jefferson will replace me

278
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Here quite well, I'm sure.

279
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I merely succeed you, dr.
Franklin. No one can replace you.

280
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Well, I fear none of us will
taste the bread of idleness.

281
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,100
There is talk of a
convention in philadelphia.

282
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
They are to discuss

283
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,800
A binding constitution.

284
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
I hope to attend, if
only to have an effect

285
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,900
On the style of its prose.

286
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,400
 

287
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,200
I expect that any
constitutional document

288
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,900
That emerges from a

289
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,500
Will be as compromised as our
declaration of independency.

290
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I am increasingly persuaded

291
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,600
That the earth belongs
exclusively to the living

292
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,000
And that one generation
has no more right

293
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
To bind another to
its laws and judgments

294
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,300
Than one independent nation has
the right to command another.

295
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,300
But surely the constitution,

296
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,500
<i>As it did with the ones we
wrote for our own states,</i>

297
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,000
Is meant to establish the stability

298
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,900
And the long-Term legality

299
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,400
Essential to the continuation
of a civilized society.

300
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,100
Yes, possibly.

301
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,200
But I fear it could prove a breach

302
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,400
In the integrity of
our revolutionary ideals

303
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,900
Through which will pour
the forces of reaction.

304
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Doctor, mr. Jefferson's pet topic

305
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,500
Is not the artful arrangement
of political power,

306
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,500
But the cordoning off of a space

307
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,200
In which no power exists at all.

308
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,700
You, sir, you are a
walking contradiction.

309
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,600
- We're all contradictions, mr. Adams.
- Indeed yes.

310
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,000
And what is government ultimately

311
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,500
But the putting into
effect of the lessons

312
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,700
Which we have learned in dealing with

313
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,400
The contradictions
in our own characters?

314
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
You have a disconcerting lack of faith

315
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,600
In your fellow man, mr. A,

316
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,000
And in yourself, if I may say.

317
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,500
Yes, and you display a dangerous excess

318
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,600
Of faith in your fellow
man, mr. Jefferson.

319
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,900
Well, I'm sure we'll all
disagree a great deal.

320
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,000
Our country is founded
on the right to disagree.

321
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,700
<i>Still, we must prevail,</i>

322
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,200
If only to prove
mr. Dickinson wrong--

323
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,400
That we will not tear ourselves asunder

324
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,700
After the defeat of our common enemy.

325
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,900
We've come too far to be
undone by petty rivalries.

326
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,600
<i>Franklin: hmm. It is no small thing</i>

327
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,700
To build a new world, gentlemen.

328
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,200
We have our republic.

329
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,300
We must endeavor to keep it if we can.

330
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,200
 

331
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,600
It will never fly.

332
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,700
It has flown, John, many times.

333
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,200
No, it's pulled up and
down, up and down on a rope.

334
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,100
Let's see what happens
when the rope is released.

335
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,700
Your husband's admirable caution

336
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,900
Sometimes blinds him

337
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,100
To unanticipated
possibilities, mrs. Adams.

338
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,900
This is one of them.

339
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,900
Yes yes, the possibility
that it will never fly.

340
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,300
I should be very sad, John,

341
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,000
If your experience of paris
has left you so unchanged.

342
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,900
I'm consoled only by the thought
that one never really knows

343
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,200
How much one has been touched
by a place until one has left it.

344
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,700
Well, I shall certainly
miss your company, Thomas.

345
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,700
And I shall miss yours, mrs. Adams.

346
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,800
London is not so very
far away, mr. Jefferson,

347
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,600
In the unlikely event you tire of paris.

348
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,700
I believe it shall tire of me first.

349
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,600
 

350
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,800
 

351
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,000
 

352
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,300
 

353
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,800
Well, I stand corrected.

354
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,200
So our umbilical cord to mother earth

355
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,000
Has been severed for the
first time in history.

356
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,300
Mankind floats upon a
limitless plane of air.

357
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,600
Hmm.

358
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,500
Hot air.

359
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,900
 

360
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
Lord carmarthen, the foreign minister,

361
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,700
Will make the official
introduction to his majesty.

362
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,200
And upon being ushered into
the royal presence chamber,

363
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,200
You will make three reverences,

364
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,200
Like so:

365
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,100
One on entering...

366
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,000
A second halfway to his majesty...

367
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,600
And a third as you come
before the royal presence.

368
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,700
Well, if you would, mr. Adams.

369
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
<i>Please.</i>

370
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,300
Well, uh...

371
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
One.

372
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,300
Lower, sir.

373
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,600
<i>Two.</i>

374
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,200
Truly lower, mr. Adams.

375
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,300
An improper reverence
has been the undoing

376
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,900
Of many a foreign ambassador.

377
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,600
Avert your eyes, sir,

378
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,700
Until you come before
the royal presence.

379
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,000
Yes.

380
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,900
May I also suggest that
perhaps a change of attire

381
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,300
Would not be unwarranted, sir?

382
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,700
What would you suggest, sir?

383
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Possibly something a
little more english.

384
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,100
 

385
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,200
 

386
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,000
Mr. John adams.

387
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,800
 

388
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,100
The United States of America--

389
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,200
The United States of America

390
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,400
Have appointed me
minister plenipotentiary

391
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
To your majesty.

392
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,300
I think myself more fortunate

393
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,800
Than all of my fellow citizens

394
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,900
In having
the--

395
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,200
The distinguishing honor

396
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,000
To be the first to stand
in your majesty's presence

397
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,300
In a diplomatic character.

398
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
I shall esteem myself

399
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,800
The happiest of men

400
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,800
If I can be instrumental in restoring

401
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,100
The confidence and affection...

402
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,300
Or in better words, the good old nature

403
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
And the good old humor

404
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,900
Between peoples who,

405
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,500
Though separated by an ocean

406
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,800
And under different governments,

407
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,700
Have the same language,
the same religion...

408
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,000
And kindred blood.

409
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,700
I beg your majesty's permission to add

410
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,600
That though I had been before

411
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,400
Entrusted by my country...

412
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,800
It was never in my whole life

413
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,200
In a manner more agreeable to myself.

414
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,000
The circumstances of this
audience are so extraordinary.

415
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,400
The language you have now held

416
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,000
Is so extremely proper

417
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,900
And the feelings you have

418
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,000
Discovered

419
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,400
So justly adapted to the occasion,

420
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,800
That I not only receive with pleasure

421
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,000
The assurance of the
friendly disposition

422
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,800
Of the united states...

423
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,800
But that I am very glad

424
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,400
That the choice has fallen on you

425
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,300
To be their minister.

426
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,500
I will be very frank with you.

427
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,700
I was the last to consent to separation.

428
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,700
But the separation having been made

429
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,000
And having become inevitable,

430
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,400
I have always said as I say now,

431
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,400
That I would be the first
to meet the friendship

432
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,400
Of the united states

433
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,400
As an independent power.

434
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,900
Thank you, your majesty.

435
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,300
There is an opinion among
some people, mr. Adams,

436
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,600
That you are not the most
attached of all your countrymen

437
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,700
To the manners of france.

438
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,500
 

439
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,500
Yes, well, I avow to your majesty

440
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,100
That I have no attachment

441
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,600
To any country but my own.

442
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,600
An honest man will never have any other.

443
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,700
<i>King George: I pray, mr. Adams,</i>

444
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,700
That the united states
does not suffer unduly

445
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,400
From its want of a monarchy.

446
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,300
Yes, we will strive to
answer those prayers,

447
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,100
Your majesty.

448
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,400
Ah, "an ambassador from america.

449
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,800
Good heavens, what a sound."

450
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,500
Why, they call me a vain imposter

451
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,100
And a pharisee of liberty.

452
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
Idiotic phrase.

453
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,900
"The morning post and daily advertiser."

454
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,200
Ah, they very helpfully
inform their readers...

455
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,000
That I was "so pitifully embarrassed

456
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
As to be very nearly tongue-Tied."

457
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,600
You must pay them no mind, sir.

458
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,500
They accuse me of vanity.

459
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,500
They always accuse me of vanity.

460
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,200
There are many different kinds

461
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,700
Of vanity in this world.

462
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,300
But there is also the vanity that comes

463
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,700
From years spent in the service

464
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,500
Of other men.

465
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,100
And of that I am most certainly guilty.

466
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,200
Guilty as charged.

467
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,000
To deny that would be sheer hypocrisy.

468
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,000
 

469
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,000
Here is someone calling for me

470
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,500
To be hanged!

471
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,400
Colonel smith, remove
these papers at once.

472
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,100
God, what a country!

473
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
Charming!

474
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I am sorry, John.

475
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,000
 

476
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,400
Are you unwell?

477
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,100
Do you remember the old
vassall-Borland estate

478
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,900
<i>Near our farm?</i>

479
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,500
Uh, yeah.

480
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,600
Rather a grand place, I recall.

481
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,600
It has become available.

482
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,800
House, farm buildings--
80 acres for £600.

483
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,300
What has brought this on?

484
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,100
My body is in one place,
my soul is in another.

485
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,400
<i>Besides, I am worried
about the children.</i>

486
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,300
They are adults now, John. They
have been without us for too long.

487
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,700
<i>- And I'm tired of this
weary place. - Mm-Hmm.</i>

488
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,100
There is no pleasure mixing
company where no one cares for you.

489
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,500
You care for no one.

490
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,500
I too feel adrift.

491
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,600
<i>I missed the constitutional convention.</i>

492
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,900
They are to elect a
new federal government,

493
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,000
And here am i,

494
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,500
3,000 miles away.

495
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,600
I will write to the congress and demand

496
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,300
My immediate recall.

497
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,200
I hold this post to be so
inconsistent with my honor and dignity

498
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,500
I can no longer endure it.

499
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,900
I'm finished with pomp and ceremony

500
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,300
And bowing and scraping and wigs

501
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,900
And all other affectations.
I'm finished with it.

502
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,900
Will they grant it?

503
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,700
I hope so.

504
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,200
 

505
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,000
 

506
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,700
 

507
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,600
Make ready!

508
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,600
Present!

509
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,800
Fire!

510
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,900
Father?

511
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,100
Charles!

512
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,100
Good heavens, you--
You look fine, sir.

513
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,800
I trust you had a peaceful journey, sir.

514
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,900
<i>John: oh, yes yes.</i>

515
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,300
 

516
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,500
- Father, this is Thomas.
- Of course.

517
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,800
Thomas. My boy, my goodness.

518
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,000
Well, you've grown into a man, yeah?

519
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,800
- It's been a long time, father.
- Yes indeed.

520
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,600
Yes indeed.

521
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,200
- Welcome home.
- John quincy!

522
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,100
- Father.
- Good! Yeah!

523
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,300
<i>Abigail: my boys.  My boys.</i>

524
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,600
Welcome home, father.

525
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,300
<i>Abigail: I feared that you
my boys. Would not know me.</i>

526
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,200
Nonsense.

527
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,900
On the contrary.

528
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,800
No, I am amazed.

529
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,200
Mother.

530
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,000
Colonel william smith, who
has been my private secretary,

531
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,100
My sons, my daughter nabby.

532
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,100
Colonel smith.

533
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,600
Abigail, shall we? Come.

534
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,800
Nabby.

535
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,900
<i>Charles, Thomas, follow
in the next carriage, yes?</i>

536
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,100
<i>Boy: god bless mr. Adams.</i>

537
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,700
Thank you!

538
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,800
Thank you.

539
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,400
It is too early for you
to speak of retirement.

540
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,800
I have been rollin like
a stone for 30 years,

541
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Never three years in the same place.

542
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,200
No, sir. I intend to
lay fast to my farm,

543
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,200
Here to live, here to die,

544
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,500
Here to lay my bones.

545
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,100
Time has already taken too many of '76.

546
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,700
The new government has my best wishes

547
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,700
And most fervent
prayers for its success.

548
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,400
The constitution was not
ratified without some difficulty.

549
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,100
We need men who will unite us.

550
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,200
<i>Our first election is imminent.</i>

551
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,000
Speculation on your future

552
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,700
Has been overflowing.

553
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,200
<i>Your name has been
mentioned for governor,</i>

554
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,700
Senator, chief justice
of the supreme court,

555
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,300
<i>Vice president,</i>

556
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,100
Even president of these states united.

557
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,100
 

558
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,300
Surely Washington, is the logical choice.

559
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,400
You would not object if i
were to put your name forward?

560
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,100
You were not meant to sit

561
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,900
In the shade of life...

562
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,400
Neither one of you.

563
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,800
If that is
what you wish--

564
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,900
It must at least be vice president.

565
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,800
Anything less would be beneath you.

566
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,100
<i>John: to peacefield,</i>

567
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,100
In honor of our lasting
peace with great britain.

568
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,100
All: peefield.

569
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,500
I could hardly ask your mother to return

570
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,300
To the wren's house of your childhood.

571
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Of course not, not after
the palaces of europe!

572
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,500
I have heard disturbing reports

573
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,000
Of your behavior at
harvard, charles--

574
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,500
Drunkenness and disorderly conduct.

575
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,100
It was only a lark, father,

576
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,900
A momentary effusion
of too much good cheer.

577
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,900
I daresay I am neither the
first person nor the last

578
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,200
To appear naked in harvard yard.

579
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,000
Well, I daresay...

580
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,000
Do not let your companions

581
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,800
Or your amusements get
the better of you, sir.

582
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,800
A scholar is always made alone

583
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,500
And sober.

584
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,300
Studies can be pursued to good purpose

585
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,800
Only by yourself.

586
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,600
Your example is always
before me, father.

587
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,700
Following your graduations,

588
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,400
I will see to it

589
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,800
That you are placed as apprentices
to the most prominent lawyers.

590
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,900
Thank you, father.

591
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,100
Johnny, how goes

592
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,500
Your clerkship with lawyer parsons?

593
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,000
It's a far cry from the
excitement of st. Petersburg.

594
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,400
I'm sure.

595
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,900
And your courtship of mary
frazier, is that not exciting?

596
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,500
How long have you...

597
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,700
Pursued this courtship?

598
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,800
I have known mary for a year now.

599
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,100
A year?

600
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,700
<i>John quincy: she is a lovely girl.</i>

601
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,900
She is intelligent

602
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,300
And well-Spoken.

603
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,800
I find her to be delightful company.

604
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,200
Nothing so like
perfection in human shape

605
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,300
Has been seen since the world began.

606
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,500
May I inquire as to the
age of the young lady?

607
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,800
She is 15, mother.

608
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,600
I will speak frankly with you, John.

609
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,600
You're too young,
you're too unestablished

610
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,600
To form any sort of romantic
attachment whatsoever.

611
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,800
To excel in the field of the law,

612
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,800
Let alone become a man of
position and prominence,

613
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,400
You must work more hours
than exist in the day

614
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,900
And more days than exist in the week.

615
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,400
- I am well aware of the
commit-- - You are not!

616
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,600
Now, I indulge you
more than your brothers,

617
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,700
And there's a reason for that.

618
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,100
Because you have a strong mind

619
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,200
And you have the temperament to succeed

620
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,000
At whatever you set that mind to do.

621
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,300
You've traveled the world, man.

622
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,600
You could achieve distinction.

623
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,600
But you have only to apply yourself.

624
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,100
Now I am willing to s you up

625
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,400
In your own practice as of tomorrow

626
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,400
With an annual stipend of £100.

627
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,000
But you must cut off this
romantic attachment immediately.

628
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,400
I will need some time
to consider your offer.

629
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,100
No! You will decide now.

630
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,200
Very well, as you wish.

631
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,900
Good boy.

632
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,200
Excellent.

633
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,800
You're smiling, miss adams.

634
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,400
Do I not have reason to
be happy, colonel smith?

635
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,200
Our family is so rarely together.

636
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,200
Your brothers seem to
be men of good spirit,

637
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,100
Charles especially.

638
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,000
My brother charles can
be rather incorrigible.

639
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,300
He can be as headstrong as father.

640
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,200
Mr. Adams has the vitality
of a much younger man.

641
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,500
Some days it's all I can
do to keep up with him.

642
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,800
Father says you commanded
a regiment of our army.

643
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,200
Yes, I had the honor to
serve under general Washington,

644
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,000
At long island.

645
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,800
Perhaps you will allow me to divert you

646
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,700
With stories from the campaign,

647
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,400
If you would not find them too dull.

648
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,000
That depends on the telling,
does it not, Colonel Smith?

649
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,700
 

650
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,800
Abigail.

651
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,400
Here's a fine culmination
to all my years of service--

652
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,600
Fewer than half the votes
of the electoral college.

653
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,200
General Washington, is
unanimously acclaimed

654
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,800
President with 69 votes,

655
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,700
Whereas I apparently am scorned
by all but 34 of the electors.

656
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:27,200
John, there are two, four, six, eight,

657
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,600
<i>10 other names here.</i>

658
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,800
You have more votes than
all of them put together.

659
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,200
<i>- And John jay comes in third with
nine. - Nonetheless, I consider--</i>

660
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,600
I consider such a showing
a stain upon my character.

661
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,500
- John!
- I will not and I cannot accept it.

662
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,600
John...

663
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,100
You are vice president now.

664
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,300
Vice president.

665
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,200
I am vice president now, hmm?

666
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,300
Mr. Vice President.

667
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,900
- Mrs. Vice president.
- Vice president adams.

668
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,500
 

669
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,400
<i>Mr. Vice President!</i>

670
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,000
Unaccustomed to refuse
any public service,

671
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
However dangerous to my reputation

672
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,500
Or disproportionate to my talents...

673
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,900
It would have been inconsistent

674
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,600
To have adopted a
different maxim of conduct

675
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,500
At this time.

676
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,100
And yet--
And yet,

677
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,800
I feel a great difficulty

678
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,200
As to how to act.

679
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,700
I am vice president, yes.

680
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,400
And in this I am nothing.

681
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,400
But I may be everything.

682
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,500
 

683
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,900
 

684
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,100
Ah.

685
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,100
Well, general, uh...

686
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,600
Uh, you are--
You are here.

687
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,500
I am, mr. Adams.

688
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,600
Um...

689
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,600
Yes.

690
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,700
Um,

691
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,200
Yes, we, uh, we are

692
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,400
Ready to administer
the oath of office, sir.

693
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,600
I am at your service.

694
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,300
 

695
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,200
 

696
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,100
<i>Boy: thank you, sir.</i>

697
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,400
General, if you will please

698
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,000
Place your left hand on the bible

699
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,500
<i>And raise your right hand.</i>

700
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,900
Repeat after me.

701
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:36,600
I, George Washington,,
do solemnly swear...

702
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,700
I, George Washington, do solemnly swear...

703
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,200
...that I will faithfully execute

704
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,300
<i>The office of President
of the United States...</i>

705
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,300
...that I will faithfully execute

706
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,100
<i>The office of President</i>

707
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,800
Of the United States...

708
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,700
<i>...and will, to the
best of my ability...</i>

709
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:06,000
...and will, to the
best of my ability...

710
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,100
...preserve protect, and defend...

711
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,400
...preserve protect, and defend...

712
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,200
...the constitution
of the United States!

713
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,500
...the constitution
of the United States...

714
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,800
So help me, god.

715
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,400
It is done.

716
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,800
God bless George Washington,

717
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,200
President of the United States!

718
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,100
 

719
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,900
A fine day. A fine day.
