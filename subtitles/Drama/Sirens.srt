1
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,791
The curator agreed to remove
the paintings from the exhibition

2
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:18,588
and sent a letter to the artist
inviting him to submit alternatives.

3
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:21,389
Unfortunately,
the offer was refused point-blank.

4
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:25,986
- He's threatened to go to the press.
- Mr Norman Lindsay, I take it?

5
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:29,187
- You've heard of him.
- Well, I like to keep abreast.

6
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:35,074
The last thing we want is a scandal.
Anyway, here they are.

7
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:38,227
Yes.

8
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:46,830
A case could be made for the
first three. They're merely vulgar.

9
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:50,189
But this one
is certainly blasphemous.

10
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:54,949
- And you want me to talk him round?
- It's on the way to your new parish.

11
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:58,789
I think an outsider has more of
a chance of getting through to him

12
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:00,273
than any of us locals.

13
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,233
I gather you were something
of a progressive at Oxford.

14
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,070
Don't believe everything you hear
but yes, element of truth in that.

15
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:11,119
He's happy to put you
and your wife up for the night.

16
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,438
I think he rather relishes
the idea of a good argument.

17
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:17,361
Well, if his reputation
is anything to go by,

18
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,919
he'd love to shock the <i>socks</i> off
any churchman that goes near him.

19
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:25,478
May I introduce you to my wife?
I don't think you've met.

20
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:31,475
Estella, the Bishop of Sydney.
My wife, Estella.

21
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:33,560
- Welcome to Australia.
- Thank you.

22
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,959
- Morning.
- Tickets, please.

23
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,446
- Do you know if a taxi's waiting?
- Yeah. There's not.

24
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,961
I, um, understand one was booked
to go to Mr Lindsay's place.

25
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,809
Doing a bit of modelling, are yous?

26
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,729
No, I certainly am not.

27
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:47,848
Taxi's been a bit late lately.
You'd be better off down at the pub.

28
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,967
May we leave our baggage here?

29
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,767
I'm about to knock off.
It'll be pilfered.

30
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:57,967
Would you mind giving us
a hand with it, then?

31
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:01,292
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
- I'll forgive you.

32
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:03,804
- Millions wouldn't.
- Oh, dear.

33
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,852
Try the pub.
It's just down the hill.

34
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:39,613
- Morning.
- Get fucked. Get fucked.

35
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,259
Ah, fuck.

36
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,738
Aw, fuck.

37
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,415
Watch the language, everyone.

38
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,660
Gents only in the bar.
Ladies' lounge is through the door.

39
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,901
Yes, we don't want a drink.
We just want a taxi, if there is one.

40
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:07,855
- Reg is at a funeral.
- I see.

41
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,054
- You could be in for along wait.
- Oh, yes?

42
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,095
It's his funeral.

43
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:18,497
Well... Thanks.

44
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,695
Hey! I got my eye on you!

45
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:24,902
- Where yous goin'?
- Out to Mr Lindsay's place.

46
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:32,936
We're goin' out that way.
We can give you a lift.

47
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:36,946
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- After we finish our beers.

48
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:09,144
Anthony?

49
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:18,429
They can't wait forever.

50
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:35,625
Fine. Come on, then.

51
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,908
Thank you.

52
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:27,509
Thanks for the lift.

53
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:29,437
I don't mean to be rude but...

54
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:32,075
you got a bit of food
on the side of your mouth.

55
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:35,352
Thanks.

56
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,430
See ya later.

57
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,842
Sorry about that, Piglet.
You all right?

58
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,440
They swear an awful lot.
They tend to, types like that.

59
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:55,237
- They didn't really say anything.
- Good.

60
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:59,438
- Now, where is everyone?
- Maybe Mr Lindsay changed his mind.

61
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:12,800
Pooh, look, there's something here.

62
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:17,517
Dear visitors, sorry we missed you.
Gone out for a picnic.

63
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:19,558
Make yourselves at home.

64
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,437
Well, I suppose
we'd better not go in.

65
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:28,244
Let's sit over by the pond.

66
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:01,288
- Mrs Campion?
- Hello.

67
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,368
What? Ah! Sorry.

68
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:12,247
I was fast asleep there.

69
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:17,323
You must be Mr Lindsay.
Lindsay Campion, my wife Norman.

70
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,605
- Estella.
- Just out from England?

71
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:23,374
That's it. We arrived
just a couple of weeks ago.

72
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:25,690
So they weren't game to send a local?

73
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:28,090
Well, you...
you're exactly on our way.

74
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:32,651
Oh, well. I'm glad
you got here in one piece.

75
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:35,244
Excuse me, I gotta get back to work.

76
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:39,290
Giddy and Sheela'll show you a room.
You'd probably like to freshen up.

77
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,215
- We'd love to, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

78
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:47,131
- You take that for me...
- This way, ladies and gents.

79
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,611
Maggie.

80
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,973
Thank you. Lovely.

81
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,130
You'll have trouble sleeping.

82
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,173
She sleeps next door
and she snores terribly.

83
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:13,140
- I do not.
- She sounds like two possums mating.

84
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:16,173
That's so horrible and it's not true.

85
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,653
Whereabouts is the, uh...

86
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,139
Take him out to the thunder box.

87
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,061
Just a tick.

88
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,662
I've never snored in my life.

89
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:34,743
I think snoring
can be quite charming, actually.

90
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:37,220
This way.

91
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:41,382
Why do they call it a thunder box?
Cos it's out in the wind and rain?

92
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:45,054
I suppose. But you always need
to keep your shoes on.

93
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:50,179
- Are there stinging nettles?
- Yes, and scorpions and centipedes.

94
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,534
Hell.

95
00:11:51,654 --> 00:11:54,385
- Can you swim?
- Not very well.

96
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:59,820
I'll wake you up. There's
a swimming hole we go to every day.

97
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:03,223
- I'm Sheela.
- Estella.

98
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:09,299
Does he always take the Bible
with him to the dunny?

99
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,216
It wasn't the Bible. He just doesn't
like wasting time, that's all.

100
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:20,307
Well, from the size of it,
he could be there all night.

101
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:25,621
I should've warned him
about the redbacks.

102
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:28,787
- What are they?
- Small spiders with big teeth.

103
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:32,745
- They live under toilet seats.
- How do you know if they're there?

104
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:34,782
By the screams.

105
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,030
Ah, there you are.

106
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:10,951
Mr Lindsay's wonderful, isn't he?

107
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:13,350
He said we're gonna do
The Sirens next.

108
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:15,432
- Do you know about them?
- Certainly.

109
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:19,027
They lived on the island of Atlantis
and sang songs from the cliffs

110
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:22,991
and sailors from passing ships were
driven mad by these gorgeous voices.

111
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:25,949
And the ships would be dashed
against the rocks

112
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,876
and the sailors dragged down
to a blissful death

113
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:33,036
with the voices of the sirens
ringing in their ears.

114
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,196
I think myths
are a bit stupid, really.

115
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:39,070
I'll be wearing this.

116
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:42,714
You know, you could pose, too,
if you like.

117
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:46,230
He always needs more models.
Go on, try it. Please.

118
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:48,589
There's some male ones too.

119
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,552
I don't think that's quite for us.

120
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:54,230
Well, you could always wear a dagger,
strategically placed.

121
00:13:57,109 --> 00:14:02,640
Or a sword. Whichever you need.
And dinner's ready.

122
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,832
Oh, that's right.

123
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:06,918
I was sent to fetch you.

124
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,995
I don't...like people thinking
I'm like the other models.

125
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:16,638
I'm working here as a maid.
Mr Lindsay asked me to pose

126
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:20,154
and I said I would
if I could keep my clothes on.

127
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:24,243
Because I really think it's important
to keep one's mystique,

128
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:26,639
don't you, Mr Campion?

129
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:29,757
Is it Mr Campion
or Father Anthony?

130
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:31,443
It's, uh, it's Tony.

131
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:37,080
Do you think it's a sin...Tony?

132
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:40,198
I don't think there's anything sinful
about the body.

133
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:43,762
There's a tradition of religious
painting featuring the nude.

134
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:48,598
It's a question of...how the artist
uses the body that's important.

135
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:52,766
So, do you think
Mr Lindsay's paintings are rude?

136
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:59,000
Some I think are profane.

137
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,481
Oh, that's good. I'm starving.

138
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,124
I only eat once a day
cos my mother's very fat

139
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,762
and it runs in my family.

140
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:11,041
You should see my grandpa.
He looks like the Michelin Man.

141
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:14,368
You know, the one
with all those tyres around him?

142
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:17,562
He eats like a horse!
He puts tomato sauce on everything.

143
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,204
It was a very enlightened society.
The artists made all the decisions.

144
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,641
That's why there's no record
of warfare

145
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,082
between the Atlanteans
and anyone else.

146
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:30,807
The main question is, where was it?

147
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:33,572
The Mediterranean
is the most likely spot.

148
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:36,048
They're always digging up pottery

149
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,846
that doesn't belong to
any known civilization.

150
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:41,693
How could a complete people
just disappear?

151
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:45,648
Well, a cataclysm. They were all
wiped out in a cataclysm.

152
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:47,811
Whole island sank in an earthquake.

153
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:50,654
So you're a genuine believer
in Atlantis?

154
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:54,132
Well, I lived there
in a former incarnation.

155
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,691
I ask because the cataclysm can be
seen as an image of moral collapse

156
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:03,525
and some think we're going through
a similar period of decay.

157
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:05,807
Do you explore that in your painting?

158
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:10,806
I think people have always
been decaying, whenever they can.

159
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:14,487
He's just a very depraved man,
I'm afraid, Mr Campion.

160
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,177
No one's safe.

161
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,810
I'm bloody bored!

162
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,457
Have you seen those fairies lately?

163
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,617
A couple of them were out
last Friday.

164
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:31,776
- They were not!
- They were too.

165
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:34,459
They always come out
on Fridays round midnight.

166
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:36,253
They do not. Do they, Mummy?

167
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:38,770
Yes, you don't see them
cos you're asleep.

168
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,540
Tonight's Friday,
as a matter of fact.

169
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:44,812
But then you'd be
too bloody bored to see them.

170
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:48,491
No, I'm not, Mummy.
I promise I won't be bored.

171
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,012
- Even bloody bored?
- Promise!

172
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,533
Well, if you're gonna be up
at midnight, get to bed now.

173
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,495
- Say good night to everybody.
- Good night, everybody.

174
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:07,779
- Do they really come, Mummy?
- Fairies only live in books.

175
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,703
The Industrial Revolution
killed the fairies.

176
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:13,180
They were left with nowhere to live.

177
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:17,458
- Except our imaginations.
- Imaginations are a luxury.

178
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,777
- Beg your pardon?
- Most people can't afford them.

179
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:25,104
I don't think imagination
is dependent on economics, is it?

180
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:29,107
In a factory you're doing exactly
the same thing day after day.

181
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:33,345
An active imagination is what allows
people to do that kind of work.

182
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:36,063
Oh, well, you'd know, of course!

183
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:40,737
I just think
that's what you'd have to do.

184
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:43,508
You'd have to be imagining
other things.

185
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:46,588
Please don't tell us
what the working <i>class</i> think,

186
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,746
thanks very much.

187
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,107
I think what the Bishop's
really hoping for

188
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,905
is that we can come to a compromise,

189
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,591
find some other examples
of your work.

190
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,988
The great thing is no... Your chair.

191
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:18,584
- No one wants to see you excluded.
- Now, that is a comfort.

192
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:22,343
I hadn't realised the Church's
interest in contemporary painting.

193
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:25,671
It's just The Crucified Venus
we're uncomfortable with.

194
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:30,543
- Pooh?
- It's me.

195
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:31,869
Come in.

196
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,550
Poor old Piglet.
Pru gave you a bit of a working over.

197
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:43,147
I'll survive.
Did you get anywhere with Mr Lindsay?

198
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:46,474
He insists it's up to the public
to decide for themselves

199
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,110
if they want to see his pictures.

200
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,956
Of course, they have to see them
first to decide,

201
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:53,511
by which time
the damage has been done,

202
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:57,187
but that is a bit of logic
which is lost upon him. Never mind.

203
00:18:58,026 --> 00:19:01,110
I'll have another shot
in the morning before we go.

204
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:04,549
Do you think the pictures
actually damage people?

205
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:08,875
I think that the sexual ones
are just rather childish

206
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:11,753
but I do think
negative images build up

207
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:13,677
and don't any good in the long run

208
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:18,431
and I think The Crucified Venus
is offensive and downright arrogant.

209
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:20,438
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

210
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,994
- Hurry up, stupid!
- I'm running as fast as I can,

211
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,238
you disgusting thing!

212
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,877
My guess is they're tooth fairies.

213
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:32,517
- Shall we?
- Come on, then.

214
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:17,691
- Swimming?
- What's the time?

215
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:21,054
The train doesn't leave until 12.

216
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:22,503
All right.

217
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:31,255
Anthony.

218
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:34,342
What'd you do to him?
He's exhausted.

219
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,537
- Anthony!
- Don't wake him up.

220
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:39,895
Well, he might be dreaming.

221
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:43,257
It's dangerous to wake somebody up
if they're dreaming

222
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:46,218
because you leave part
of your brain behind.

223
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:48,941
If it happens a lot,
you go feeble in the head.

224
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:52,423
Yeah. You're living proof.

225
00:22:55,295 --> 00:22:58,106
All right, I'll join you in a minute.

226
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:24,060
- Are you rich?
- Not very.

227
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,461
- What does your father do for crust?
- Why do you ask?

228
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,585
Well, Pru thinks you're bourgeois,
that's all.

229
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,783
Mine was taken by a shark.

230
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:37,824
God, how awful!

231
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:40,990
There wasn't much left of him.

232
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:44,548
So I was brought up mainly by my mum.
She runs a sweet shop.

233
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:48,792
But I'm quite ambitious all the same.
I was determined to keep my figure,

234
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:52,669
which was hard with chocolate wombats
and toffee apples everywhere.

235
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:56,708
- But as you can see, I succeeded.
- Because you wanted to be a model?

236
00:23:56,823 --> 00:23:59,110
Oh, no.
Modelling is just to get known.

237
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:01,112
I'm going to be a famous actress.

238
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:04,034
People will know me through
Mr Lindsay's paintings,

239
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:06,306
then I'll move on to
stage and screen.

240
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:19,474
They're just doing it to show off.

241
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:22,669
They're very common.
They can't help it.

242
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:25,950
Sheela's got
ten brothers and sisters.

243
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:30,391
She wants to be an artist like Norman
but poor girl, she's hopeless.

244
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:35,318
- And Pru wants to be an aviator.
- Aviatrix.

245
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:39,556
I'm gonna splash you.

246
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:51,198
- Be careful of the water snakes.
- There aren't any water snakes.

247
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:06,161
Quick, someone's coming!

248
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:12,636
- Hide!
- It's all right, he can hardly see.

249
00:25:13,752 --> 00:25:16,233
- Devlin!
- Come and have a swim.

250
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:21,154
Don't get him to come in.
He might...brush against you.

251
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:35,916
Come in.

252
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:49,045
You shouldn't have anything to do
with him. He's a criminal.

253
00:25:49,157 --> 00:25:52,320
- You dream about him, don't you?
- I do not!

254
00:25:52,437 --> 00:25:55,806
You lie on the ground
while he licks your belly button.

255
00:25:55,918 --> 00:25:59,923
You're so disgusting, flaunting
yourselves. You're so cheap!

256
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:02,848
He wouldn't know
if we were dressed or not.

257
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,566
Do you have to carry on
in front of Estella?

258
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,604
- What's wrong with her?
- She'll think we're...barbarians.

259
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,563
We are!

260
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,490
Don't. Don't. Don't.

261
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:29,807
- Morning.
- Morning.

262
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:34,286
The papers got hold of it.

263
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:38,852
"When the exhibition arrives in
London, the English will be convinced

264
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:43,492
"Australia is peopled by degenerates
afflicted with sex mania."

265
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:45,606
Must be why they deported us.

266
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:50,333
The other news is that it seems
we'll be here for another day or so.

267
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:54,131
The train was derailed and a
section of track has to be repaired.

268
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:57,727
Rose is very kindly giving us a ride
into town this afternoon

269
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:00,008
to see how long it's going to be.

270
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,769
These flies are
remarkably persistent.

271
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:07,891
I just...ate one, I think.
Came in on me honey.

272
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:09,771
Made me feel funny...

273
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:12,049
in me tummy.

274
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:26,056
- May I speak?
- Briefly.

275
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:29,855
I just wondered if you'd be
interested in today's editorial?

276
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:32,495
I try to ignore the press
as much as I can.

277
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,217
Isn't it hard
to sustain your vision

278
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:38,494
when it flies so completely
in the face of public opinion?

279
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,220
So the arrows of your detractors
bounce off, do they?

280
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:45,653
Vanity is a formidable armour.

281
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:51,336
Oh, here we go.

282
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:56,141
"The excesses of Lindsay have
long <i>been</i> a <i>source</i> of consternation

283
00:27:56,253 --> 00:27:59,223
"to clean-living citizens
of this country.

284
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:03,134
"He paints people who seem to be
slaves of cocaine or similar,

285
00:28:03,254 --> 00:28:06,861
"which has reduced them to
frenzied and shameless morbidity.

286
00:28:07,774 --> 00:28:12,099
"Today, however, not content with
scorning standards of public decency,

287
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:17,665
"he profanes the most sacred image
of Christianity, the Crucifixion."

288
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:21,222
As if I give a damn about
these Wesleyans, these wowsers.

289
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:25,136
Well, it's quite a lot of people
who hold the Crucifixion sacred.

290
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:28,499
- Anyway, you're busy.
- Mr Campion, I am an artist

291
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:32,622
and I refuse to be compromised by
the scruples of the public!

292
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:36,060
- Scruples or beliefs?
- And this Crucifixion business.

293
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:38,100
When I was a boy,

294
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,745
my mother used to try to instruct us
on the sad story of Jesus,

295
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:43,941
how He died on the <i>cross</i> for us.

296
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,142
My whole being rose in revolt
against the idea!

297
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,662
It's a vile notion
that a god should sacrifice himself

298
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,102
for the sins of mankind,
it's a pestilent notion.

299
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,224
- Well, I couldn't agree with that.
- Hang on.

300
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,868
As for the suffering my poor pictures
will cause a few people,

301
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:05,032
it's nothing compared to
the suffering the Church has caused.

302
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:08,225
The burning of witches,
the Spanish Inquisition,

303
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:10,993
the slaughter of pagan tribes
and so on.

304
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:13,104
Anyway, there we are.

305
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:14,713
Must get back to work.

306
00:29:17,743 --> 00:29:19,791
I don't think the Church
can be blamed

307
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:24,033
for everything done in-in-in-in its
name but we'll take this up later.

308
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:32,034
Well, now, here's a thing.

309
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,991
You see the article in here about
Atlantis? There's a new theory.

310
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:38,714
Off Norway, they reckon.

311
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:42,512
When it sank,
it must've caused a tidal wave,

312
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:45,277
so they're looking at
old Nordic texts

313
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:48,276
to see if there's any evidence
of flooding.

314
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:53,270
You're disgusting, Sheela.
You should be in a sty.

315
00:29:57,987 --> 00:30:04,156
- Watch this. Watch Giddy's skin.
- Don't you dare. Don't, Sheela.

316
00:30:04,988 --> 00:30:06,798
One day, we're gonna tickle you...

317
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,795
and we're gonna keep tickling you
all over.

318
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,752
Stop it.

319
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:15,680
Look at her arms and legs.
Look at the goose pimples.

320
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,315
Sheela. Will you be quiet?

321
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,913
- Do you know who else will do it?
- Shut up.

322
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:24,513
- He'll be tickling you too.
- He will not.

323
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:27,522
He'll tickle you...there.

324
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:32,441
She'd burst.
Her insides would go everywhere.

325
00:30:32,552 --> 00:30:34,156
Sea slugs do that.

326
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:37,116
When they get attacked,
they spit their insides out.

327
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,439
You can eat them and go all night.

328
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:41,920
There are islands
where the women gang up

329
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:44,001
and ambush their favourite men

330
00:30:44,113 --> 00:30:46,924
and feed them
the longest sea slugs they can find.

331
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:49,402
And the men get so incredibly hard,

332
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,724
you can hang heavy clothes and jewels
from their erections.

333
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:57,123
- But doesn't it hurt?
- Excruciatingly.

334
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:59,318
Giddy's guts would be good for that.

335
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:00,880
They would not!

336
00:31:00,995 --> 00:31:05,479
My giblets are pure and innocent,
like my mind.

337
00:31:19,518 --> 00:31:22,522
Let's hope it's good news and
then we can get out of your hair.

338
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:26,644
- A couple heads more doesn't matter.
- That's very kind of you.

339
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,808
I suppose there's no point
in trying to prevail on you

340
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,845
to help persuade Norman just to
withdraw that particular picture?

341
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,770
- Mr Campion...
- Tony.

342
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:42,690
Have you actually seen it?

343
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,883
Yes, very briefly in the gallery.

344
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:49,124
I was the model for it, you see...

345
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:04,454
One, two, three, charge!

346
00:32:09,323 --> 00:32:11,372
Stop it.

347
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,767
Stop it at once!

348
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,568
What do you think you're doing?
Go on, get off! Get off.

349
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,773
Go on, shoo, all of you.
All of you, go away.

350
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:36,214
What on earth was all that about?

351
00:32:36,328 --> 00:32:39,059
They're just acting out
what their parents say -

352
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,172
Norman's the devil incarnate
and we're all witches.

353
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,412
Go on, now, shoo.

354
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:48,738
- You eat sheep poo!
- You disgusting things!

355
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:30,180
- How do I look?
- Very nice.

356
00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:34,619
Can I wear it tonight? Pru and I
are going out with some blokes.

357
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:39,744
I suppose so.

358
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:46,061
Do you often try on other people's
clothes without asking?

359
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:49,306
All the clothes I've ever worn
are other people's.

360
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:56,340
- Is this the ship you came out on?
- Yes.

361
00:33:57,497 --> 00:33:59,148
My dad was a sailor.

362
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:02,661
What does he do now?

363
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:07,783
He's dead.

364
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:12,661
I'm sorry.

365
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:14,463
A shark took him.

366
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,423
They found an arm with his watch.

367
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:19,986
That's what they buried - the arm.

368
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,503
Still used a normal-sized coffin
though, just for appearances.

369
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,511
I hadn't realised sharks were so...

370
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:29,430
Successful?

371
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:38,825
Do you like your husband?

372
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:42,914
Do people usually marry people
they don't like?

373
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:45,469
Quite often, I'd say.

374
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,908
Now, Devlin,
I want you to pose as Ulysses.

375
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:52,550
Is he the chap
you're going out with?

376
00:34:52,664 --> 00:34:55,827
God, no. He just does
odd jobs around the place.

377
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,627
- But he can't see.
- He can't see much.

378
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,509
Norman says it's all a blur.

379
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:05,277
There was a big prizefight
out in the bush.

380
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:08,356
It went on for hours.
Blood everywhere.

381
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:12,358
In the end, they had to stop
cos Devlin was blind.

382
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:15,118
After a few days, he could see a bit,

383
00:35:15,227 --> 00:35:18,436
but he can't hardly recognise
anyone until they speak...

384
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:24,031
...but Giddy thinks
he's the best thing since Valentino.

385
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:28,112
Merely routine for you,
old boy, I would've thought.

386
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:31,073
See ya tomorrow night, all right?

387
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:41,116
For too long,
you've kept sensuality in the gloom.

388
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,837
You've made it furtive and guilty!

389
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:48,434
The Church has never denied that
sex has a supremely important role.

390
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:53,001
"Vaginal pessaries require
a manipulation of her genital organs

391
00:35:53,112 --> 00:35:55,922
"which must be repugnant
to every woman."

392
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,320
See, that's the problem.
God makes us feel so guilty...

393
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:02,437
When Dolly Rogers allowed me
to play with her parts,

394
00:36:02,553 --> 00:36:04,521
I thought I'd be struck by lightning.

395
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:06,954
- One point.
- What's your point?

396
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:09,121
Mr Campion is trying to say

397
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,078
if we give way to our whims,
we're no better than pigs.

398
00:36:12,194 --> 00:36:14,766
- Pigs?
- That's not my point!

399
00:36:16,835 --> 00:36:21,477
If God didn't want us to play with
these parts, why make them fun?

400
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:25,680
So many people can't feed their kids
and the Church says, "Have more."

401
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:27,560
Here come your lovers.

402
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:31,362
Look, Jesus never said anything
about chastity, anyway.

403
00:36:31,477 --> 00:36:34,242
That started with
some old men on an island

404
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:37,247
that suddenly decided
the body was bad for the soul.

405
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:40,520
- Atlantis, was it?
- It's a pity for women it wasn't.

406
00:36:40,637 --> 00:36:43,721
The fact is,
the gloomy God of the Old Testament

407
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,523
still has us by the scruff
of the neck today.

408
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:50,324
When He was invented,
there were a lot of pagan religions

409
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:53,921
that celebrated sexuality
and fertility and so on.

410
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,680
So how is this new religion
to compete with something so popular?

411
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:02,328
By saying that sex was evil and that
women, the embodiment of sexuality,

412
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,491
were responsible for the downfall
of mankind in the Garden of Eden!

413
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:11,368
- So we're second-class citizens.
- Mrs Pankhurst would be proud.

414
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:14,849
- Why can't we be vicars or priests?
- Or popes?

415
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:19,331
Because we're too deafened by the din
of our bodies to hear God's Word.

416
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:22,845
- Here, here.
- May I answer that question?

417
00:37:22,963 --> 00:37:25,091
- May I speak?
- Come in, boys.

418
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:27,968
- Evenin', all. G'day.
- Evening.

419
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:37,253
You're late.

420
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,607
We had to fix up...
a couple of flyblown sheep.

421
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,056
Did you wash your hands?

422
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,176
Twice.

423
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:51,215
- Eww, it's horrible.
- It's only oil, honey.

424
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:54,649
It's sheep poo. You got sheep poo
in your fingernails.

425
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:59,338
It's OK. We'll be wearing gloves.

426
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:04,013
Well...better get going, I suppose.

427
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:05,368
See yous later.

428
00:38:06,648 --> 00:38:09,255
- Good night.
- See ya.

429
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,891
Try one of these.

430
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:19,500
They're Turkish.

431
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:30,662
Don't worry, Giddy.
Your time will come.

432
00:38:42,332 --> 00:38:45,974
- Any luck?
- No.

433
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:50,903
"Is there a Piglet
in the house?" said Pooh.

434
00:38:56,574 --> 00:38:59,225
They're trying to shock us,
aren't they?

435
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:02,782
Well, church-baiting's
always been a popular pastime.

436
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:05,136
I got an awful lot
of it at university.

437
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:09,227
The atheists always think it's funny
to roast the dusty old Christian.

438
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:12,545
The great thing, of course,
is not to be too dusty.

439
00:39:12,656 --> 00:39:17,026
You should have seen Lindsay's face
when I started quoting Joyce at him.

440
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:22,587
Something wrong, Piglet?

441
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:24,109
No.

442
00:39:24,218 --> 00:39:28,428
Those girls are perfect models
for Lindsay's orgies, aren't they?

443
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:33,579
A shame about Giddy.
I think there's hope for her.

444
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:37,863
She was, um...sticking up for me
at dinner. Did you notice?

445
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,670
Oh, dear. I probably shouldn't have
brought you here, should I?

446
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,263
- Pooh...
- Piglet.

447
00:39:53,062 --> 00:39:55,463
I think...

448
00:39:56,582 --> 00:39:59,745
sometimes you have too high
of an opinion of me.

449
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:01,591
What on earth makes you say that?

450
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:06,186
- Oh, I don't know.
- You are a funny little thing.

451
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:15,704
It's freezing. Come on, then.

452
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:29,635
Do you want to?

453
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:31,555
I'm not sure.

454
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:34,796
Well...you don't have to decide now.

455
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:37,308
- You wake me up if you do.
- All right.

456
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:38,872
According to Mr Lindsay,

457
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:42,150
we should both be in a state
of perpetual tumescence.

458
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:57,487
- What are you doing?
- Watching you sleep.

459
00:42:57,604 --> 00:43:01,609
Looks like you both
had another punishing night.

460
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:06,534
I wish you wouldn't creep
into our room every morning!

461
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:08,215
We've just been for a swim.

462
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:11,647
I just wanted to tell you
how nice the water was.

463
00:45:38,704 --> 00:45:41,833
Hello! Stop!

464
00:45:55,826 --> 00:45:59,229
- What happened to you?
- You're a terrible mess.

465
00:45:59,347 --> 00:46:01,394
I went for a walk.

466
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:05,193
- Stupidly...got lost.
- Come on.

467
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,231
Plenty of room.

468
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:20,277
- Here. Put this on.
- I don't want to dress up.

469
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:24,111
You look as if you've been
in an orgy. Who were you with?

470
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,435
No one.

471
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,679
Don't be a spoilsport. Please?

472
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,159
Oh...all right, then.

473
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:44,634
Fuckin' pub.

474
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:48,394
You get fucked. And you too.
You get fucked.

475
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:52,074
And you. You get fucked too.

476
00:46:52,193 --> 00:46:54,844
Go on and get fucked. Get fucked.

477
00:46:54,954 --> 00:46:57,240
Three jugs of beer
and a créme de menthe.

478
00:46:59,074 --> 00:47:03,045
Hello? Hello?

479
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,044
Sorry, lounge is closed.

480
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,841
- What about them?
- Just closed a few minutes ago.

481
00:47:08,955 --> 00:47:12,756
- Well, the main bar's open.
- The main bar's for men.

482
00:47:13,555 --> 00:47:17,925
- Don't worry. Let's go.
- We came here for a drink.

483
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:23,000
Hey, Tom! Lewis.

484
00:47:23,117 --> 00:47:26,007
Get us some drinks, will ya?

485
00:47:31,678 --> 00:47:34,966
Forget 'em. They're pretending
they don't know us.

486
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:38,080
That boil in the
middle of your bum...

487
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:40,520
you should have it
looked at by a doctor.

488
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,326
It might go septic.
Your whole bum might fall off.

489
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,002
- What if we drink outside?
- That's against the law.

490
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:56,284
It's against the law
to be open on a Sunday.

491
00:47:57,962 --> 00:47:59,884
Get fucked.

492
00:48:10,243 --> 00:48:12,689
One, two, three!

493
00:48:14,363 --> 00:48:17,207
- Your mother's a trade unionist?
- Yep.

494
00:48:17,323 --> 00:48:21,090
The sort that'd put people like you
up against a wall and shoot 'em.

495
00:48:21,204 --> 00:48:24,526
- My family aren't wealthy.
- What does your father do?

496
00:48:24,644 --> 00:48:28,286
- He's an antiques dealer.
- Mine was a sailor.

497
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,214
He's dead.

498
00:48:32,046 --> 00:48:34,173
Taken by a shark?

499
00:48:34,285 --> 00:48:36,812
Blown to bits in a battle.

500
00:48:36,926 --> 00:48:39,373
They only ever found his foot.

501
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:43,810
- What's funny?
- I'm sorry.

502
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:14,611
One, two, three!

503
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,098
- Let go of my foot.
- One, two, three!

504
00:49:17,211 --> 00:49:21,421
- Let go of my foot!
- One, two, three!

505
00:49:25,572 --> 00:49:26,983
You haven't caught us yet.

506
00:49:28,572 --> 00:49:32,213
All right, girls. Jiggle your biceps.
This'll be piss easy.

507
00:49:42,134 --> 00:49:44,375
Charge!

508
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:53,583
- Hopeless!
- Pitiful!

509
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:57,299
- Kelly O'Hara!
- Sean Connolly!

510
00:49:57,416 --> 00:50:01,307
- Seamus O'Hurd!
- Patrick O'Shaugnessy!

511
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:25,190
I'm gonna be honest with you. I find
your lustful women preposterous.

512
00:50:25,299 --> 00:50:28,702
- That doesn't surprise me.
- I am married, Lindsay,

513
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,585
so I do have some experience
of the opposite sex.

514
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,070
I can assure you my wife is about
as far from your debauched harridans

515
00:50:36,181 --> 00:50:38,627
as animal is from vegetable.

516
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:40,949
And which is she, Mr Campion?

517
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:46,033
- Sorry.
- Animal or vegetable?

518
00:50:55,703 --> 00:50:57,353
What are you doing, Giddy?

519
00:50:57,463 --> 00:51:00,707
Dancing away all my impure thoughts.
I'm filled with them.

520
00:51:01,624 --> 00:51:02,785
You should be doing it.

521
00:51:02,904 --> 00:51:06,511
You need to more than me.
Oh, not you, Estella.

522
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:09,868
She needs to more than anyone.

523
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:17,110
Ah, the world's going round.

524
00:51:23,986 --> 00:51:26,911
What are you picturing
in your mind, Giddy?

525
00:51:27,027 --> 00:51:28,631
Nothing.

526
00:51:28,747 --> 00:51:33,196
- You're getting slippery.
- What do you mean?

527
00:51:34,668 --> 00:51:39,436
I know somewhere...
where she'd be really ticklish.

528
00:51:39,549 --> 00:51:41,472
Don't.

529
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:21,125
He leaps from rock to rock
with the grace of a mountain goat.

530
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,601
- You all right?
- Rose. Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

531
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,485
- Just a bit out of breath.
- Were you running?

532
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:22,966
Walking.

533
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,412
Briskly.

534
00:53:37,123 --> 00:53:39,808
I think it's time
you paid a visit to Mr Devlin.

535
00:53:39,923 --> 00:53:42,244
I don't chase men.
It's undignified.

536
00:53:45,964 --> 00:53:47,967
What's that in his hand?

537
00:53:49,444 --> 00:53:53,370
- It looks like Estella's hat.
- Yes.

538
00:53:53,485 --> 00:53:57,411
L...l lost it when I went out for
a walk. He must've picked it up.

539
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,688
So that's why you were blushing
in the car.

540
00:53:59,806 --> 00:54:02,093
I was feeling ill, I told you.

541
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:12,335
Let me go.

542
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:14,212
You ticklish?

543
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,378
Excuse me.

544
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:37,096
Would you...please untie me?

545
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:41,261
Please, will you untie me?

546
00:54:45,612 --> 00:54:47,739
My hands are going to sleep.

547
00:55:21,176 --> 00:55:23,019
Thank you.

548
00:55:40,418 --> 00:55:45,220
- That tunic suits you.
- I thought we might go to evensong.

549
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:49,830
All right, I'll go and change.

550
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,502
So must I.

551
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:09,547
- Where were you?
- We went into the town.

552
00:56:09,662 --> 00:56:13,224
You went to the pub.
I can smell it on your breath.

553
00:56:15,463 --> 00:56:18,034
Why are you wearing
that ridiculous outfit?

554
00:56:18,143 --> 00:56:21,625
It's...part of what they've been
using in the latest paintings.

555
00:56:21,743 --> 00:56:23,314
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

556
00:56:23,424 --> 00:56:26,075
Does this mean
you'll be doing some modelling?

557
00:56:26,184 --> 00:56:28,425
There's no need to be offensive.

558
00:56:31,984 --> 00:56:34,590
- Estella, what's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong!

559
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:52,434
In its long history, one of
the enduring strengths of the Church

560
00:56:52,547 --> 00:56:55,471
has been its capacity
to withstand persecution,

561
00:56:55,587 --> 00:56:57,955
insult and ridicule.

562
00:56:58,068 --> 00:56:59,752
Since its inception,

563
00:56:59,868 --> 00:57:04,079
those who have sought to
mock Christians have been legion.

564
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:08,592
Even Jesus Christ Himself
felt their lash -

565
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:13,317
on the street, in the marketplace,
even at the end on the cross.

566
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:17,515
"Where are you now,
you King of the Jews?"

567
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,440
they called out to Him in his agony.

568
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:24,351
In every age,
still more come forward

569
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:29,683
to scorn His name
and to defame His most sacred images.

570
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:33,922
But true Christians,
secure in their faith,

571
00:57:34,032 --> 00:57:37,673
can identify such detractors
for what they are -

572
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:40,524
the disciples of the devil,

573
00:57:40,633 --> 00:57:45,879
the destroyers of all
that is precious in family life,

574
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:50,682
the harbingers of darkness and chaos.

575
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:27,130
Please be seated.

576
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:35,086
- What on earth is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

577
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:40,890
What strange, deluded, conceited
creatures we human beings are.

578
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:45,204
We think we have secrets

579
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,562
but how can we have secrets
from God,

580
00:58:47,681 --> 00:58:53,052
who knows our innermost thoughts
every moment of the day?

581
00:59:03,403 --> 00:59:05,486
Giddy, what's wrong?

582
00:59:06,564 --> 00:59:10,535
He's in the studio.
He's staying there tonight.

583
00:59:11,644 --> 00:59:13,454
I'm going to seduce him.

584
00:59:14,564 --> 00:59:17,011
You're drunk.

585
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:20,335
Did he say anything...
anything about me

586
00:59:20,446 --> 00:59:23,609
- when he untied you?
- No.

587
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:28,094
He's too shy, you see?

588
00:59:28,726 --> 00:59:31,650
I think you should lie down
for a while.

589
00:59:31,766 --> 00:59:34,008
We're so out of touch
with our passions.

590
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:37,927
I mean, I'm such
a bourgeois little thing,

591
00:59:38,047 --> 00:59:41,291
too scared even to reveal myself
to a painter.

592
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:47,657
I'm going to start walking around
without any clothes on

593
00:59:47,769 --> 00:59:51,297
because, well,
clothes are just ost...

594
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:55,380
"ostentatious figments
of middle-class imagination."

595
00:59:55,489 --> 00:59:58,300
That's Pru's nonsense.

596
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:01,062
It's just a bit cold tonight.

597
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:07,455
Well, I'd better go and get ready.

598
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:10,142
This is the first day
of my new life.

599
01:00:10,251 --> 01:00:12,902
No, the first night
of my new life.

600
01:00:51,496 --> 01:00:53,499
She'll have to <i>cross</i> the Arafura Sea.

601
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,699
She'll be here in a few days.

602
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:03,821
What are you trying to do?

603
01:01:03,938 --> 01:01:07,660
Look. This is where Amy Johnson's
got to in her plane.

604
01:01:07,779 --> 01:01:08,985
She was almost eaten by cannibals.

605
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:12,706
What are you trying to do to Giddy?
She'll make a fool of herself.

606
01:01:12,819 --> 01:01:15,823
You've seen her.
She's about to burst out of her skin.

607
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:20,025
- She doesn't know what she's doing.
- Why are you so concerned?

608
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,666
- You jealous?
- Don't be ridiculous.

609
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:27,264
- You like him too, don't you?
- We didn't speak when he untied me.

610
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:32,262
- You didn't need to.
- You're really shocking.

611
01:02:10,546 --> 01:02:14,518
Your characters all seem so ravenous.
Can't love ever be gentle?

612
01:02:15,627 --> 01:02:18,392
Yes, of course it can,
but I'm not painting love scenes.

613
01:02:18,507 --> 01:02:20,748
Sorry, yes - "lust scenes."

614
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:24,589
But there is a fierceness in desire,
isn't there? In lovemaking?

615
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,437
One of life's great conundrums.

616
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:29,200
The only one,
according to your paintings.

617
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:31,437
I admit that the human universe

618
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:34,678
is infinitely richer
than my meagre palette.

619
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:38,715
For instance,
I do absolutely no justice at all

620
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:42,391
to the nervous Nellies and
the shrinking violets, the saints...

621
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,354
You're very contemptuous
of shrinking violets.

622
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:49,556
Dear Estella,
I'm a shrinking violet myself.

623
01:02:49,671 --> 01:02:52,436
I choose to live
not in the real world but in here.

624
01:02:52,551 --> 01:02:55,600
I flee from the real world
into my little studio

625
01:02:55,712 --> 01:02:59,683
and there before me is the
unlimited canvas of my imagination.

626
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:03,923
But your paintings,
they do go out into the real world.

627
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:07,560
While you have a wonderful
imagination, most are stunted

628
01:03:07,673 --> 01:03:10,644
and you have no idea what effect
they'll have on people

629
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:12,802
or what they might
incite them to. Rape?

630
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,759
Mr Campion, in my opinion,

631
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,038
the female body is the most
beautiful thing in the world

632
01:03:19,155 --> 01:03:24,116
and if it turns you into a ravenous
maniac I'd suggest it's a good idea

633
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:28,366
if your wife takes the greatest care
to get undressed behind a screen.

634
01:03:29,637 --> 01:03:33,278
Estella's seen the pictures too.
Are we in danger from her?

635
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:37,288
You're so patronizing, Mr Campion.
Everyone has a rich imagination.

636
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,208
What stunts it
is capitalist exploitation.

637
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:43,288
Go to Soviet Russia
where they've been liberated,

638
01:03:43,398 --> 01:03:45,207
there's an explosion of creativity.

639
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:48,242
Have you been to Soviet Russia, Pru?
Have you?

640
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:53,047
I thought for a moment someone knew
what they were talking about.

641
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:57,643
Communism has exploded every value,
leaving a vacuum of moral anarchy.

642
01:03:57,759 --> 01:04:02,448
- Anarchy is freedom!
- Balls! Sorry. Sorry.

643
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,607
Freedom for the strong
to dominate the weak.

644
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,645
It's exactly as before,
just a different set of bullies.

645
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:12,129
Speaking of bullies, where's Giddy?

646
01:04:31,244 --> 01:04:34,248
- I thought you'd lost that hat.
- Yes.

647
01:04:34,364 --> 01:04:36,970
One of the girls must've found it.

648
01:04:38,085 --> 01:04:42,932
So, um, where was Giddy tonight?

649
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,014
You like her, don't you?

650
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:49,777
"Try one of these, they're Turkish."

651
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:53,614
No, I just...

652
01:04:53,726 --> 01:04:56,809
I just worry about her
with those other two.

653
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:59,738
She's drunk herself into a stupor.

654
01:04:59,848 --> 01:05:01,976
Planning to throw herself at...

655
01:05:03,008 --> 01:05:04,658
that odd-job man.

656
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,490
Yes, he's quite a character,
isn't he?

657
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:13,170
Apparently, he had a dangerous
reputation before he lost his sight.

658
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:16,020
This whole country's dangerous.

659
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:20,055
You know, I've been mulling over
what you said to me the other night

660
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,857
about...about me
thinking too highly of you.

661
01:05:23,971 --> 01:05:28,499
- I don't see either of us as saints.
- That's a relief.

662
01:05:28,611 --> 01:05:33,173
Yes, I've done plenty of things
I'm ashamed of, stretching way back.

663
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:38,696
- What sort of things?
- I remember when I was at school,

664
01:05:38,812 --> 01:05:41,259
we had this
ridiculous initiation ceremony

665
01:05:41,373 --> 01:05:44,104
for the new boys,
the "scum" as we called them.

666
01:05:45,212 --> 01:05:48,899
- I was put through it myself.
- What happened?

667
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:53,224
Well, we used to stand 'em
on a chair, take their trousers down,

668
01:05:53,334 --> 01:05:56,417
whip 'em with wet towels
while they recited Tennyson.

669
01:05:56,534 --> 01:05:59,014
- You know the sort of thing.
- Do I?

670
01:06:00,735 --> 01:06:05,537
Anyway, that's just...
something I wanted you to know.

671
01:06:13,296 --> 01:06:17,541
In view of...today's activities.

672
01:06:19,057 --> 01:06:20,627
What are you talking about?

673
01:06:22,498 --> 01:06:26,025
I think you know,
I'd rather not put it into words.

674
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:56,988
Sorry I'm so noisy.

675
01:06:57,102 --> 01:07:01,949
It's all right.
They'll all be asleep.

676
01:09:56,604 --> 01:09:58,891
You are the Winnie the Pooh
sleeping in today.

677
01:09:59,004 --> 01:10:02,008
- What's the time?
- Nearly three.

678
01:10:02,124 --> 01:10:04,127
Message from your friend Sheela.

679
01:10:04,245 --> 01:10:08,614
She didn't want to wake you for
swimming as you needed your rest.

680
01:10:08,725 --> 01:10:11,730
Seemed quite smug about it, actually.

681
01:10:11,845 --> 01:10:14,497
I might have one now, then.

682
01:10:16,206 --> 01:10:18,574
To wake me up.

683
01:10:18,687 --> 01:10:21,167
Right. Good idea.

684
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:50,659
- How are you feeling?
- Really buggered.

685
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:54,014
I woke in the night with a blanket
stuck to me like a cloak.

686
01:10:54,131 --> 01:10:55,895
I'd spilt that horrible drink.

687
01:10:56,012 --> 01:10:58,013
I looked like a huge emerald mint.

688
01:10:59,772 --> 01:11:01,615
Not that it mattered.

689
01:11:01,732 --> 01:11:04,736
- Why? What do you mean?
- I went to the studio to see him.

690
01:11:04,852 --> 01:11:08,335
He was there doing it
with somebody else.

691
01:11:08,453 --> 01:11:10,455
Who was it?

692
01:11:13,374 --> 01:11:16,184
It was dark.
I suppose it was Sheela or Pru.

693
01:11:17,334 --> 01:11:20,384
They've got absolutely no morals
at all.

694
01:11:20,495 --> 01:11:24,181
I just feel so stupid.
I thought he liked me.

695
01:11:29,775 --> 01:11:32,825
So I'm not going to have
anything to do with men any more.

696
01:11:32,936 --> 01:11:35,701
- I've made a big decision.
- What decision?

697
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:38,058
You'll see. So will Norman.

698
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:07,343
- Change your mind?
- Yes.

699
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,703
Disappointing news.
The organisers have backed down.

700
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:14,030
Exhibition's going ahead
with all the original paintings.

701
01:12:15,341 --> 01:12:19,631
- Still, we did our best.
- I wish we could leave now.

702
01:12:19,742 --> 01:12:21,870
That's the good news.
The track's been repaired.

703
01:12:21,982 --> 01:12:25,703
- We'll get the first train tomorrow.
- Thank goodness.

704
01:12:28,703 --> 01:12:30,785
I'll tell Lindsay.

705
01:12:45,425 --> 01:12:49,225
Sorry, just thought I'd let you know
we'll be off in the morning.

706
01:12:50,346 --> 01:12:52,667
Right.

707
01:12:58,146 --> 01:13:00,070
Right.

708
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:18,553
You're very naughty so I'm not
going to give you this chocolate.

709
01:13:18,669 --> 01:13:22,355
Honey! Honey, come quick.

710
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:31,477
This lamb is absolutely delicious.

711
01:13:31,591 --> 01:13:35,437
Very nearly as good as Welsh lamb
and that's saying something.

712
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:39,320
Well, um...

713
01:13:39,432 --> 01:13:41,912
thank you very much
for your hospitality.

714
01:13:42,032 --> 01:13:43,443
Bottoms up.

715
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,759
We've enjoyed ourselves.

716
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:48,877
I like a little opposition.
It clears the mind.

717
01:13:56,154 --> 01:14:00,796
So, um, I gather
you're a boxer, Mr Devlin.

718
01:14:00,914 --> 01:14:03,805
Yes, I used to do a bit
of boxing myself, actually.

719
01:14:03,914 --> 01:14:06,236
Quite a keen pugilist in one's day.

720
01:14:06,355 --> 01:14:11,486
Lost a huge part of this tooth from
a great haymaker someone gave me.

721
01:14:11,595 --> 01:14:15,885
I expect you've got some
pretty bad <i>scabs</i> to show as well.

722
01:14:16,876 --> 01:14:22,007
Apart, obviously, from the...
eye thing, which is beastly.

723
01:14:27,118 --> 01:14:29,438
Well, unfortunately,
during his last fight,

724
01:14:29,558 --> 01:14:32,607
Mr Devlin was gasping for air
with his tongue hanging out

725
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:36,484
and he got this enormous uppercut
under his chin and lost most of it.

726
01:14:36,598 --> 01:14:39,250
Bulldust, Norman.

727
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:43,049
He makes a brilliant Ulysses, anyhow.

728
01:14:43,159 --> 01:14:46,288
We always call him into the water
and he never comes.

729
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,971
Whoever he was,
you'd try to get him in.

730
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:53,051
- You'd get in the whole army.
- God, you're charming tonight.

731
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,485
Thinking about the Atlantis series,
I'd like to do more research.

732
01:14:57,601 --> 01:15:00,889
I was thinking of mounting
an expedition to go and find it.

733
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:03,402
You might like to come.

734
01:15:04,722 --> 01:15:09,047
- Devlin could be the pilot.
- Giddy could be the navigator.

735
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:11,134
I'm not going if they're going.

736
01:15:11,243 --> 01:15:12,608
- What?
- Why not?

737
01:15:12,723 --> 01:15:14,930
I can't trust you
as far as I could kick you.

738
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:19,493
- Thanks very much.
- What are you talking about?

739
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:21,015
You know!

740
01:15:21,124 --> 01:15:24,207
You always eat cheese
when you're feeling guilty.

741
01:15:24,844 --> 01:15:26,256
Excuse me.

742
01:15:29,045 --> 01:15:32,015
Sorry, I'd better go and see
if she's all right.

743
01:15:36,326 --> 01:15:40,218
- What?
- Nothing.

744
01:15:44,366 --> 01:15:46,176
Piglet? You all right?

745
01:15:46,287 --> 01:15:48,654
Yes, I'm...I'm fine, thank you.

746
01:15:50,408 --> 01:15:52,775
Are you feeling a bit funny?

747
01:15:53,888 --> 01:15:55,413
Probably all that Stilton.

748
01:15:57,129 --> 01:16:00,258
You were packing it down,
weren't you?

749
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:07,620
- Well, I'd better...I'll go back.
- Pooh.

750
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:12,494
I think...we should talk.

751
01:16:14,331 --> 01:16:20,134
- Right you are. What about?
- Ever since we got here, I...

752
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:26,254
Well, now, I think some things
are best left unsaid.

753
01:16:27,692 --> 01:16:31,140
But that means
we'll always be strangers.

754
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,415
No, not really.

755
01:16:35,253 --> 01:16:38,178
- Only small parts of us.
- The bad parts.

756
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:42,025
No, I think it's good
to have a few secrets.

757
01:16:44,414 --> 01:16:46,304
Do you?

758
01:16:49,495 --> 01:16:51,259
That way, in 50 years' time,

759
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:54,982
we'll still be able
to surprise each other.

760
01:16:55,936 --> 01:16:57,540
Perhaps you're right.

761
01:17:04,056 --> 01:17:05,980
I love you, Piglet.

762
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:40,830
- What's the matter?
- You must've been dreaming.

763
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:42,750
When you saw someone with Devlin.

764
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:44,751
You were so drunk.

765
01:17:44,862 --> 01:17:48,344
I looked in here
and you were absolutely sozzled.

766
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:52,149
- But it was so real.
- Dreams always are.

767
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:55,429
The other two swear it wasn't them

768
01:17:55,543 --> 01:17:57,750
and you know how they like to boast.

769
01:17:59,064 --> 01:18:01,305
Do you still like him?

770
01:18:02,504 --> 01:18:07,226
- I suppose so.
- You should go in and see him, then.

771
01:18:07,344 --> 01:18:08,471
NOW?

772
01:18:08,585 --> 01:18:12,670
That's what your dream
was telling you.

773
01:18:14,025 --> 01:18:17,154
Here, put this on.

774
01:18:17,265 --> 01:18:20,315
- But it's your wedding ring.
- It's always brought me luck.

775
01:18:20,426 --> 01:18:22,873
- Has it?
- Always.

776
01:18:22,987 --> 01:18:24,750
Wear these.

777
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:29,711
Try some of this.

778
01:18:34,988 --> 01:18:37,673
We'll have to fix your hair.

779
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,960
Good luck.

780
01:22:01,134 --> 01:22:03,865
I want to wake up now.

781
01:22:17,215 --> 01:22:21,062
- What? It was night...
- You were shouting.

782
01:22:21,176 --> 01:22:23,827
Really loudly.
I heard you from the garden.

783
01:22:23,936 --> 01:22:27,737
But I wanted to tell you about
last night. Oh, it was wonderful.

784
01:22:27,857 --> 01:22:31,100
I mean, I didn't do everything
with him because...

785
01:22:31,217 --> 01:22:33,823
I don't think
he's good enough for me but...

786
01:22:33,937 --> 01:22:37,260
oh, he did some things
which were just...

787
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:40,949
Gosh!

788
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,184
How dare you use her
without permission?

789
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,829
- I don't need permission.
- It infers that she modelled!

790
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:00,143
You cannot just put
someone in your painting!

791
01:23:00,261 --> 01:23:03,743
It's totally compromising.
She'll be outraged. I'm outraged!

792
01:23:03,862 --> 01:23:07,230
- Perhaps we ought to ask her.
- I don't need to. If she wanted...

793
01:23:07,342 --> 01:23:09,629
Anthony? What's the matter?

794
01:23:09,742 --> 01:23:12,712
Mr Lindsay has put you
in his latest painting.

795
01:23:14,063 --> 01:23:16,669
He has to paint over you
or we'll take legal action.

796
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:20,788
He can turn you into someone else.
You'd better have a look.

797
01:23:45,786 --> 01:23:47,789
Well?

798
01:24:10,309 --> 01:24:12,881
It's a good likeness.

799
01:24:49,914 --> 01:24:54,682
Devlin, better get back
to work. Catch.

800
01:26:00,283 --> 01:26:02,889
They're asleep.

801
01:26:03,003 --> 01:26:04,926
For goodness sake!

802
01:26:09,444 --> 01:26:10,810
We'll be arrested.

803
01:26:14,605 --> 01:26:17,176
We'll be excommunicated.
