Well, that's as it should be.

Keep your eyes

Depend on it...
If war comes,

the United States will fight
on the British side.

What you learn
might help postpone that war.

Maybe prevent it.

574
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,752
Of course, you could never
reveal your services,

Yeah? What was wrong
with my old passport?

Very good.

00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,744
But not
as good as you think.

Why won't you do it?

661
00:42:09,082 --> 00:42:13,085
It's dangerous,
as I have reason to know.

662
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,220
That's why people
will eat it up.

663
00:42:14,254 --> 00:42:15,638
And who would catch the bullet?

664
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:18,090
Me.

665
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:20,926
Say another damn word

666
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:23,395
about that bullet catch
and I swear,

667
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,931
I'll leave you behind
in the nearest ditch.

668
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,103
My son...

669
00:42:35,025 --> 00:42:37,359
He died doing the catch.

670
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,398
Did you load the gun?

671
00:42:46,202 --> 00:42:47,169
And pulled the trigger, too.

- You're a liar.
- Come again?

678
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,891
That story's straight
out of Houdin's book.

679
00:43:08,975 --> 00:43:11,560
[Laughs] How he met
a traveling magician, Torrini,

680
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:13,145
who'd killed his son
doing the bullet catch.

681
00:43:13,229 --> 00:43:14,113
You're a liar.

682
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:17,316
Your hero, Houdin,
was a liar, too.

683
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,035
And by the way, it's "who-Dan,"
not "how-din."

684
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:21,987
Houdin never ran
into any magician

00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:24,206
who killed his son,
and that book

687

There's only enough truth in it
to make you believe the lies.

Because that's how magic works.

689
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:33,382
Magicians are liars,

690
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,051

are the best liars.

take a measure of powder,
we pour it down the barrel.
