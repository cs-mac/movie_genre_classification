1
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:14,450
I heard you are
doing another program?

2
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:22,159
Hot, isn't it?

3
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,328
Do you know how to use
a fire extinguisher?

4
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:37,198
Forget it.

5
00:00:41,313 --> 00:00:43,713
I know how to cheer you up.

6
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:47,816
Want to have a drink?

7
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:11,460
-Were you drinking?
-No.

8
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:14,797
You had a lot.

9
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,473
Why did you drink so much?

10
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:28,216
I didn't.

11
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:34,490
You'd better lie down.

12
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:41,192
Are you okay?

13
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:54,008
What?

14
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:10,291
Something's wrong.

15
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:25,668
Are you really okay?

16
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,585
What's wrong?

17
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,554
Something's wrong.

18
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:54,931
Don't cry. Don't cry...

19
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:24,997
Eun-su, come and have some breakfast.

20
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:30,836
Have some breakfast, Eun-su.

21
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:33,477
I'm not hungry. I want to sleep more.

22
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,409
I made something good. Get up, okay?

23
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:43,110
I don't want to.

24
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:50,418
Come on. Get up.

25
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:53,722
Leave me alone! Just go away!

26
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,099
How long have you been
singing ''Arirang''?

27
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:39,905
I started when I was 20...

28
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,773
How long ago is that?

29
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:43,913
60 years.

30
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:46,017
60 years?

31
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:56,253
Ma'am, do you sing
''Arirang'' with him too?

32
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:03,425
That's a ridiculous question.

33
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:07,066
Men do not sing with their wives.

34
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:09,263
Not like these days.

35
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:11,841
Not even once with her?

36
00:06:12,044 --> 00:06:16,743
Men do not sing with their wives.
Not old man like me.

37
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:22,648
Are you ready?

38
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:24,686
Why don't you sing, Ma'am?

39
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:40,463
I put up a thorn fence
to hold in my youth.

40
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:49,104
But it slipped away,
leaving me with grey hair.

41
00:06:49,514 --> 00:07:01,585
The sun must set when it's time comes.

42
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:13,059
I wish my lover
had a good reason to leave.

43
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:24,739
Arirang...Arirang...Arariyo.

44
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:35,690
I follow my love up Arirang Hill.

45
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:48,933
What are you going to do now?

46
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:50,701
We're almost finished.

47
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:54,878
What do you mean?

48
00:07:57,716 --> 00:08:00,913
I mean, we're almost finished.

49
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,192
What's finished?

50
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,635
I said we're almost done.
Didn't you hear me?

51
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:21,763
-What's finished?
-Oh, Jesus.

52
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:33,341
I just wanted to know...

53
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:40,387
what you are going to do
after this project? Okay?

54
00:08:58,476 --> 00:08:59,966
I've got to go somewhere.

55
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,976
Come make me some ramen, okay?

56
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:08,747
Okay?

57
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:12,581
I have work to do.

58
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:14,547
What work?

59
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,693
Something I don't know about?

60
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:20,759
You're going drinking aren't you?

61
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,897
Eun-su.

62
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:32,941
Do I look like your maid?

63
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:35,336
Watch your language.

64
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:51,880
Eun-su, I got you something to eat.

65
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:24,846
This is FM Music Hall
with Han Eun-su.

66
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:34,189
Please feel free to share
all your love stories with us.

67
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:57,412
I loved you with
all my life could bear.

68
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:09,216
I trusted you with such sincerity.

69
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:18,831
I know I shouldn't have loved you.

70
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:28,910
I'd be willing to try it again,

71
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:34,515
but goodbye...

72
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,739
Hurry up. The producer
is going crazy. Okay?

73
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,382
All right.

74
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:11,184
Is this the one?

75
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:14,856
Hello?

76
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,100
Where are you going?

77
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:28,270
Move!

78
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,072
I'm in the sound studio.

79
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:35,639
It's been a while.

80
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:19,623
I have to get back to work.

81
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:22,190
Are you still angry?

82
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:30,162
Are you happy that I came?

83
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,966
Did you miss me?

84
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,214
I should go.

85
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:05,287
Are you asleep?

86
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:09,432
No.

87
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:21,737
Sang-Woo, let's not see
each other for a month.

88
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:33,549
Do you mean you want
to break-up with me?

89
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:38,658
Would you want to?

90
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,492
I don't know.

91
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,863
Grandma! Grandma!

92
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:31,076
It's been a long time since
we had dinner together.

93
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:32,977
Do you normally have your meals
at regular time?

94
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,930
Sang-Woo.

95
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:53,598
Where is your girlfriend? I thought
I told you to bring her home.

96
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:57,237
You have a girlfriend?
Marry her, then.

97
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:59,966
I can't take care of
your family forever.

98
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:01,509
I am tired.

99
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:05,177
-I don't have one.
-You don't?

100
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,351
You should get married while
your grandma is still alive.

101
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,186
And I want a grandson too.

102
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:22,198
You want me to set you up?

103
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,265
I know a nice girl.

104
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:26,025
Don't bother.

105
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,603
I'm full. Can I be excused?

106
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,640
Where are you going?
You haven't finished yet.

107
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,246
I lost my appetite.

108
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:39,416
I bought pork belly just
because you are home.

109
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:43,553
Mother, eat slower, okay?

110
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:45,585
Come on, mom.

111
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,799
Something's going on, isn't it?

112
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:09,938
Nothing's going on.

113
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:26,326
Hang on son.

114
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:54,489
Hi, it's me. How you doing?

115
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,527
You sound busy.

116
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:06,469
Okay. Don't want to bother you.

117
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,072
Seems like we are pretty far away.

118
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:21,745
You scared of me?

119
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:32,157
Drive faster.

120
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,429
Faster.

121
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:04,852
Hello?

122
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:14,765
I said I'd call you. Stop doing this.

123
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:29,748
What are you doing here?

124
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:43,333
Hey.

125
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:44,865
What's up?

126
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:50,799
I don't think
I can continue working here.

127
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,441
Let's go for a drink after work.

128
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:02,950
I'll find someone to replace me.

129
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:10,917
What are you talking about?

130
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:17,093
What's the matter with you?
You know better than that.

131
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:18,792
Aw, fuck!

132
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:22,864
What? Fuck?

133
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,773
I'm sorry.

134
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:27,443
Stay here...

135
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:30,178
Come back!

136
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,558
Let me stay here tonight.

137
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:31,066
Let me stay here tonight.

138
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:39,074
Sang-woo.

139
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:05,860
Eun-su, want to see something funny?

140
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:16,645
Don't act like this.

141
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,490
You want a ride?

142
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:15,033
No, thanks!

143
00:27:18,575 --> 00:27:20,839
I didn't do anything wrong, did l?

144
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:40,686
See you.

145
00:28:10,661 --> 00:28:12,720
Could you stop, please?

146
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:36,082
I want to break up.

147
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:46,596
I'll do better.

148
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:52,468
Let's break up.

149
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:08,444
Do you love me?

150
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:23,732
How could love disappear so fast?

151
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:45,548
Let's break up then.

152
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:13,034
Grandma, let's go.

153
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:20,878
Grandma, come on.

154
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:24,913
I have to wait for your grandfather.

155
00:31:28,392 --> 00:31:30,656
He's gone.

156
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:34,558
He's passed away, Grandma.

157
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:38,834
Let's go.

158
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:44,664
Get a hold of yourself!

159
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:48,738
Get a hold of yourself!

160
00:33:41,191 --> 00:33:44,558
-Hey, how've you been?
-You skip dinner again?

161
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:49,291
I'm eating now.
Want to go to Kang-neung?

162
00:33:57,174 --> 00:33:58,835
Let's have a drink.

163
00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:02,570
Nah. I don't want to drink.

164
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:06,876
Because if I get drunk,

165
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,153
I will feel like
she's waiting for me again.

166
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:17,250
Sang-woo, forget about her.

167
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:21,663
Imagine she's an old woman.

168
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:25,197
Her hair's all gray,
she's got wrinkles.

169
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:28,794
That might help you forget.

170
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:31,903
Just keep that in mind.

171
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:35,542
Right.

172
00:34:37,614 --> 00:34:40,344
I feel kind of sorry
for an old Eun-su.

173
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,954
But I still miss her.

174
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:53,356
Let's go.

175
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:01,831
Stay a little longer.

176
00:36:59,823 --> 00:37:01,791
What are you doing here?

177
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,294
I just wanted to see you.

178
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,127
Are you going somewhere?

179
00:37:14,504 --> 00:37:16,802
Go home. I've got to leave.

180
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:21,907
Do you want a ride?

181
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:04,680
Was it hard to find?

182
00:39:04,814 --> 00:39:05,838
Yeah. You got here early?

183
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:07,482
Yeah, we've been waiting for you.

184
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:11,779
-My friends.
-How are you?

185
00:39:11,988 --> 00:39:14,252
-You must be tired. Let's get inside.
-OK!

186
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:17,579
Sang-woo!

187
00:43:13,563 --> 00:43:15,258
Let it out.

188
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:20,227
Buses and women are all the same.

189
00:43:20,436 --> 00:43:23,337
Once they leave,
they will never stop for you.

190
00:47:33,422 --> 00:47:36,914
-How have you been?
-Very well.

191
00:47:38,728 --> 00:47:40,992
You haven't changed a bit.

192
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,238
Do you remember?

193
00:48:03,886 --> 00:48:05,717
What?

194
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,681
You know...

195
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,331
It's for your grandma.

196
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,474
I heard plants are good for old
people. Take good care of it.

197
00:49:03,212 --> 00:49:05,874
Stay with me today.

198
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,121
What's wrong?

199
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,282
I should go.

200
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,718
Goodbye.

201
00:49:59,602 --> 00:50:01,229
Sang-woo!
