1
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:46,337
Miss?
Miss, can you hear me? Miss?

2
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:19,807
<i>All right,
everybody, let's get it on.</i>

3
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:15,706
Come here.

4
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:44,106
Hey, Frankie!

5
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:46,276
Here you go, sweetheart.

6
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:48,681
Wall Street.

7
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:54,478
Oh, yeah,
princess! Yeah!

8
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,992
- Here you go.
- No holding out.

9
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:26,593
Wall Street!

10
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:28,953
Try reading a newspaper, Hal.
Wall Street's going down!

11
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:31,399
Yeah, and dicks are going up.

12
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,567
Keep 'em coming, Frankie!

13
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:38,160
Let's go, chickies.
Now come on, let's move it.

14
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,410
Shut up!

15
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,713
- Frankie.
- That's pretty sad...

16
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:46,333
Can you believe that sleazy son-of-a-bitch
humping out my leg like a dog?

17
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:49,954
- It's gonna take forever to get this shit off.
- Girl, I'm trying to eat.

18
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:51,523
He tipped me $4.

19
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:53,359
Can you believe that shit?
Four...

20
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,559
Oh, I was just waiting for him
to start counting quarters!

21
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:59,397
I told you working
on the floor is for chumps.

22
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,737
Now if you was a Leo like me,
you'd have figured it out already.

23
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:07,017
I can take one look at their face and
tell who ain't getting no sugar at home.

24
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:09,610
And that's the one got
the most money for Frankie.

25
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,296
I'm a Pisces,
so what does that mean?

26
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:13,286
Charlie,
get down those stairs now.

27
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:17,295
Shit, blame your mama.
I don't know!

28
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:21,759
You through with
the newspaper, sweetie?

29
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,170
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

30
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:24,662
Hey, Frankie?

31
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:26,581
You want some of this?

32
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:28,300
I don't mess with that.

33
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,834
Okay, just tell me something.

34
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:32,271
It gets easier, right?

35
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,874
When I went out there tonight,
I thought I was gonna barf.

36
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:36,876
Here's what I do, baby.

37
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:40,230
I close my eyes and
let the music take me.

38
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,584
Like I'm on the outside,
just watching.

39
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,353
Like I ain't even there.

40
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,791
Like I'm watching myself
from the outside.

41
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:51,759
- Works for me.
- Thanks.

42
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,461
Thanks, Frankie.

43
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:54,964
You did the crossword?

44
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:56,702
No, I didn't.

45
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:01,087
Well, yeah, sweetheart.
Sure looks like you did.

46
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:03,673
No, I didn't.
That ain't even my handwriting.

47
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:06,745
Genius has
done the crossword again.

48
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,780
I'll take that.

49
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,651
What you trying to do, Frankie?
Make us look bad?

50
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,120
Got something to prove?

51
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,436
So, are we going or what?

52
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:52,932

Girl, you're on fire.

65
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,911
What did you think of that?

66
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:02,030
Eight in the corner.

67
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,949
No way. Not happening.

68
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,836
She's gonna fold like a table.

69
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,723
Frankie doesn't have it in her.

70
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,199
Did you see that?

71
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,035
Line 'em up!

72
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:23,025
Frankie, that's some sharp shooting, baby.
Real sharp.

73
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,444
Polyester Molester...
Marry me!

74
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:30,412
Honey, that ain't for real.

75
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:32,181
Hey, how do you know that?

76
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:35,419
Number one, he's white.
Number two...

77
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:37,022
He's white!

78
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:41,092
I know one guy who don't need
no sock in his pants.

79
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:43,092
Who, Cliff?

80
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:46,166
He's so fine,
I'd fuck him for free.

81
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,340
Me too.

82
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,912
Yeah?
Make you feel good? Yeah?

83
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:58,045
What?

84
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:00,182
- Touch me.
- Yeah, baby.

85
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:03,724
Give it to me.

86
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:24,143
Frankie?

87
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,785
What's the problem?

88
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:33,801
Frankie! Hey!

89
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,902
It's all right.

90
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:49,418
Took the kid to her mama's
on Crenshaw, so...

91
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:55,649
Frankie, we good, baby.

<i>Mama, what's wrong?</i>

93
00:10:00,954 --> 00:10:04,256
Come on, baby, you can't leave me hanging
like this. I been really nice to you.

94
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:06,461

Frankie.
Frankie come on, baby.

101
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:33,123
Frankie is not here.

102
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:35,126
What are you talking about?
Come here.

103
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,310
Frankie, come on!

104
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,510
You are hurting me!

105
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,096
- No, I'm not.
- You're hurting me.

106
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:41,202
Okay. Okay. Okay.

107
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:47,408
Frankie, it's me. Okay? It's okay.
I ain't gonna hurt you.

108
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:49,476
Shit!

109
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:52,880
- Damn it!
- Okay.

110
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,217
Frankie!

111
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:57,849
Get your ass back here, Frankie!

112
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,256
I'm going to kill you, girl!

113
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:03,614
I swear to God
I'm going to kill you dead!

114
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:07,197
Shit! Frankie,
get back here!

115
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,621
Get off the road!

116
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:28,621
Watch it!

117
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:44,308
Frankie! Bitch!

118
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:45,759
You're crazy!
You know that?

119
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,119
You're a crazy goddamn bitch!

120
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:48,212
Get out of the intersection,
are you drunk?

121
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:49,915
- Jesus!
- You crazy freak!

122
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:52,417
Man, you're gonna get hit, girl.
What's wrong with you?

123
00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:54,091
How could you do this to me?

124
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:02,762
Hey, Miss?

125
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:04,298
Miss, do you hear me?

126
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,601
Hey, get up!
Come on! Get up!

127
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,153
You think she's on drugs?

128
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,797
Hey!
You listening to me?

129
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,442
Come on! Get up! Get up!

130
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,494
Let's get this junkie
off the road.

131
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:48,756
Watch your head, Miss.

132
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:22,390
<i>Dr. Sawyer to admitting.</i>

133
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,854
<i>Dr. Sawyer to admitting.</i>

134
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:25,793
Sorry.

135
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,275
Dr. Oswald?

136
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:43,813
You're here early.

137
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:51,490
Nurse Shaw.

138
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,461
Do you listen to jazz?

139
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:59,601
A colleague from the faculty
of arts once told me

140
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:03,504
that he'd had the most amazing
results from listening to jazz.

141
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:07,408
He claimed it allowed him full
access to the subconscious state

142
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:11,748
without any need for
hallucinogens or stimulants.

143
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:13,617
I don't experience
anything at all.

144
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:16,120
Well, maybe you're not
listening properly.

145
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,588
Yes, I am.

146
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:21,726
This equipment...
It's absolutely state-of-the-art.

147
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:24,128
Dr. Oswald...

148
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:26,431
Are you free to
handle an admission?

149
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:27,400
A patient?

150
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,080
I looked everywhere
for Dr. Michaelson

151
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,948
but I think he is
somewhere over in trauma.

152
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,604
No.

153
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:37,178
That's not my department and
I have to teach a class in...

154
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,481
Well, several hours.

155
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,783
Well, I'm sure you'll
be through by then.

156
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:44,587
Can't it wait
for Dr. Michaelson?

157
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,155
He's much more
efficient than I am

158
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:49,859
and I don't want to step
on anybody's toes, so...

159
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,297
These tapes will be
here when you get back.

160
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:55,297
Doctor?

161
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:01,605
Miles Davis!

162
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:06,812
Maybe I'll have better
results with Miles Davis.

163
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,549
- Or even Dave Brubeck and...
- Oh!

164
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:13,520
She is somewhat disoriented,
but she doesn't appear drunk.

165
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,456
Her name is...

166
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:17,058
Murdoch.

167
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:18,904
Miss Murdoch?

168
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:30,073
<i>- Dr. Martinez to treatment room four.
- Oh!</i>

169
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:32,442
<i>Dr. Martinez to
treatment room four.</i>

170
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:34,812
Doctor, her file.

171
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:36,812
Oh.

172
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,085
So...

173
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:42,285
Miss F.R. Murdoch.

174
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,058
Nope.

175
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:48,661
- You're not Murdoch?
- No, that's me.

176
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,967
It's just my middle name
ain't R. It's Lucinda.

177
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,204
Lucinda?

178
00:15:56,404 --> 00:16:00,741
Lucinda... From the Latin,
<i>lucidus via lucere, meaning "to shine".</i>

179
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:03,211
An origin it shares
with the word "lucid"

180
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,417
meaning "to think
or see clearly."

181
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,652
It's a beautiful name.

182
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:10,822
Do I know you?

183
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:13,326
No, we've never met.

184
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:16,629
I'm Dr. Oswald.

185
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:19,131
Shit.

186
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:22,803
This one's pretty
bad on my leg...

187
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:25,806
No...
Oh, wait...

188
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:29,676
You don't even know
what you're doing.

189
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:31,878
Oh, yes, I do.
I'm a doctor.

190
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,878
Can you hold that?

191
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:43,259
Why do you think we've met?

192
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:45,761
I don't know.

193
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:48,999
Maybe you came to see
me dance or something.

194
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,252
Oh, you're a dancer?

195
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,236
Yup.

196
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:53,639
Ballet?

197
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,691
Exotic.

198
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,743
Exotic?

199
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:00,548
I'm a stripper.

200
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:03,548
Well...

201
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:07,820
How many times have
you been admitted?

202
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,157
To Pearce or some place like it?

203
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:13,294
You knew your way
to the examination rooms.

204
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:16,632
You thought we'd met,
but you couldn't remember.

205
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:19,570
What else can't you remember?

206
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,570
What happens?

207
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,576
I get a little mixed up,
that's all. Come on.

208
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:28,979
Let's get this
show on the road, Doc.

209
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:30,648
66.

210
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,484
You're in good shape.

211
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:35,887
Well, thank you.

212
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:38,723
What do you mean
"mixed up"? Drugs?

213
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,861
Are you currently
taking any medication?

214
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,696
Any recreational drug use?

215
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,699
That depends what
you talking 'bout, Doc.

216
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,467
Benzodiazepine?

217
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,803
Methaqualone?
That's Valium and Quaaludes.

218
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,438
None of that shit.

219
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,343
Frankie got rules.
No smack, no blow, no speed.

220
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:55,844
LSD?

221
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:57,445
Did you hear what I said?

222
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:58,817
No!

223
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:03,454
I smoke a little reefer...
That's it.

224
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:05,558
Look at my nose.

225
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:14,065
What were you doing
running in traffic?

226
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:15,708
Were you being attacked?

227
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,024
You don't recall, do you?

228
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:28,715
I think we should keep
you here for a while.

229
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:29,917
<i>On what grounds?</i>

230
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:32,755
Blood pressure, normal.
Indications of memory loss.

231
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:33,955
No sign of nystagmus.

232
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,823
Exactly, she was
absolutely reeking

233
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:39,395
of alcohol, and yet,
there was no oscillation at all.

234
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,964
Completely smooth pursuit
at every deviation.

235
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,502
So she can hold her liquor...
Well, that certainly is interesting, Joe.

236
00:18:45,702 --> 00:18:47,238
- Discharge her, please.
- No!

237
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:49,875
Does she pose a significant
threat to others?

238
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:52,711
- No.
- Is she gravely disabled?

239
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:54,445
- No.
- No. So she's out.

240
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:56,249
I'm sorry, Joe.
I don't have the beds.

241
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,251
They found her in
the middle of the street!

242
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,420
She has no recollection
of how she ended up there.

243
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,789
Come on, Joe.
She's a stripper from Watts.

244
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:04,959
She was probably
coked out of her mind.

245
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,694
Then keep her for three days.
Wait for the toxicology report.

246
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:11,499
- Joe.
- Don't you have a class?

247
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,859
Now, I thought you cut right
back on the clinical work.

248
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,238
- Yes.
- Doctor.

249
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:18,474
Look, we will patch her up
and we will send her home.

250
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:20,253
Let the cops handle it, please?

251
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,769
<i>Zuca abra. Se que esta ahí,
déjeme entrar. Vamos abra.</i>

252
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,253
What?

253
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:13,738
Shit!

254
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,331
Oh, hey, Hector.<i>
¿Qué pasa, jefe?</i>

255
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:19,479
Your check bounced.

256
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,082
<i>Cheque rechazado!</i>

257
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:22,716
What?

258
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,086
- No, no, no. I got money in the bank.
- No, you don't.

259
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:28,089
Yes, I do.
You pay now.

260
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,558
You pay now,
or you go find a new place to play crazy.

261
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:32,060
Okay.

262
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,574
Okay, just hold on a minute.
See what I got.

263
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:45,077
Okay.

264
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,346
Here you go,
$20 it's what I got for now.

265
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,265
Give me a couple days.
I'll get the rest. Come on...

266
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:53,184
You know I'm good for it,
Daddy. Come on, you know...

267
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:54,753
You know Frankie good for it.

268
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,322
This is the last time.

269
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,656
- Okay.
- Last time.

270
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,991
<i>Te quiero, papi.</i>

271
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:27,991
What?

272
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:19,089
Oh, Jesus!

273
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:23,126
Again?

274
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:26,796
What?

275
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:28,665
- What?
- Stop!

276
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:31,634
- What's going on?
- Get off!

277
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,466
You got something to say,
you ought to just say it.

278
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,843
You need help!

279
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:41,980
- Come on now, honey. Let's go.
- What's going on, Wanda?

280
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,616
- They say you attacked him, Frankie.
- Who?

281
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:47,252
Cliff! They say you
cut his head wide open!

282
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:48,855
What got into you?

283
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:51,458
He try something on you?
He try to hurt you?

284
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:52,711
Frankie! Talk to me!

285
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:55,227
Frankie!

286
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:00,415
I can't have it, Frankie.

287
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:02,704
I can't.

288
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:04,875
You're out of here.

289
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,299
Fuck you then, Hal.

290
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,070
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Bobby.

291
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,240
Smell good!

292
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,411
When do we eat?

293
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:07,713
Wha...

294
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,073
I just said,
"When do we eat?"

295
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:11,410
I heard what you said.

296
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,962
We gonna eat when she gets here,
not before.

297
00:24:35,078 --> 00:24:37,048
Mama,
this is just like back home.

298
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:42,121
- No, Mama, I can't.
- Oh...

299
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,357
I'm fitting to bust!

300
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:45,959
Look at you girl,
there's nothing to you.

301
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,862
Would you stop that.
Why don't you open your present?

302
00:24:49,062 --> 00:24:50,382
I'll take
a little more cornbread.

303
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:53,366
I hope you saved room
for blueberry pie.

304
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:54,936
Now, you know I did!

305
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:05,714
Oh, Frankie.

306
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:08,853
That's a ruby.
That's my birthstone.

307
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:10,632
And that's amethyst for Maxine.

308
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:13,373
So you think of us.

309
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:14,725
You shouldn't have.

310
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:17,261
You think I don't already?

311
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:20,967
Frankie, you didn't have to go
wasting your money on me like this.

312
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,247
- All right then, I'll take it back.
- No, you won't!

313
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:24,971
I'm gonna put this on right now.

314
00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:27,008
I am never gonna take it off.

315
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:31,881
Must be going pretty good
at the telephone company?

316
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:34,950
They're going real good.

317
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,385
Guess what, Mama?

318
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:39,923
I'm going to night school
to get my degree.

319
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:42,428
Night school.

320
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:47,165
You love it, Mama?

321
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:48,787
Oh, Frankie, it's beautiful.

322
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,368
It's beautiful!

323
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:55,374
Seen the paper today, Frankie?

324
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:56,875
Maxine!

325
00:25:57,075 --> 00:25:58,444
Go fetch that pie in here.

326
00:25:58,978 --> 00:26:01,246
Why?

327
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:05,152
That girl, Paige your dearest friend?
She's getting married.

328
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:06,052
Maxine!

329
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:08,388
Oh, yeah? To who?

330
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:11,161
Some rich guy here in the city.

331
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,931
Right here in LA?

332
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:17,399
Yeah, that's why they
put it in the newspaper.

333
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,838
Works with Governor Reagan some shit.
Should be quite a party.

334
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,723
Maxine Murdoch, where'd you get such
spite in you only the Devil knows.

335
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,958
I'm okay, Mama.

336
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,291
Happy birthday.

337
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:40,961
I'm glad you like your present.

338
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:42,632
I love it.

339
00:26:44,632 --> 00:26:47,468
Y'all got a Paige
Prescott staying there?

340
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:48,669
<i>One moment, please.</i>

341
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:52,976
<i>Hello? Paige Prescott.</i>

342
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:54,976
<i>Hello?</i>

343
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:57,682
<i>Who is this?</i>

344
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:28,899
Oh.

345
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,317
Hey.

346
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:34,357
Hey, Bobby.

347
00:27:34,557 --> 00:27:38,294
I was gonna get some coffee.
Do you want... I should get two?

348
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:39,705
Yeah. Coffee'd be good.

349
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:53,245
<i>Paige, wait!</i>

350
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:55,314
<i>Wait for me, Paige!</i>

351
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:57,582
<i>You can't catch me.</i>

352
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:01,224
<i>You can't catch me.</i>

353
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,894
<i>Come on, Frankie!</i>

354
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:07,696
<i>Frankie? Frankie!</i>

355
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:09,298
<i>Let's play!</i>

356
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:10,498
<i>Frankie.</i>

357
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,172
<i>- Frankie!
- Frankie?</i>

358
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:22,546
Frankie?

359
00:28:26,117 --> 00:28:28,065
<i>Come on, Frankie!
I'm gonna catch you!</i>

360
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,623
Frankie?

361
00:28:30,823 --> 00:28:33,392
No. Don't you touch me.
Don't touch me!

362
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:36,162
<i>- Come back here!
- Frankie...</i>

363
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:38,765
<i>Come on, Frankie!</i>

364
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:43,605
<i>It's not your place!</i>

365
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,575
<i>- I'm gonna catch you!
- It's not your place!</i>

366
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:48,478
<i>Frankie?</i>

367
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:50,079
<i>Come on, let's play!</i>

368
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,780
<i>Francine Murdoch!</i>

369
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,683
Get out!

370
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,551
<i>You and me,
Frankie, friends forever.</i>

371
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:56,551
Frankie?

372
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,192
Frankie?

373
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:02,897
Frankie?

374
00:29:05,897 --> 00:29:07,169
Frankie?

375
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:11,441
<i>Frankie's not here.</i>

376
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,728
Hello, Paige.

377
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:30,732
You look beautiful.

378
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:34,971
I'm sorry, have we met?

379
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:40,058
I'm so angry
I missed the ceremony.

380
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:42,753
Now, I won't bore
you with my reasons.

381
00:30:42,953 --> 00:30:45,001
Not too sure there's
a difference between

382
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:47,250
a reason and a plain
old excuse anyhow.

383
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,819
Well, how are you?

384
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,655
I'm well.

385
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:56,426
Remember, we always said we'd be there
for each other on our wedding day.

386
00:30:56,626 --> 00:30:57,964
I'm here, Paige...

387
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:02,269
And I wish you every happiness.

388
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,638
Frankie?

389
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:08,807
Now is that your
husband back there?

390
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:10,509
I would like to see him...

391
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,583
How could you?

392
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,421
Why would you come here?

393
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:25,678
Paige...

394
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:27,530
Excuse me?

395
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,450
- There seems to be a misunderstanding.
- Well, there certainly does!

396
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:32,587
She seems to think
I'm somebody I'm not.

397
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:34,806
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

398
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:36,540
I will not leave here.

399
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,409
I was invited.

400
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:39,979
Just walk with
me this way, Miss.

401
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:42,248
Take your hands off me, boy!

402
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:45,817
I will have you fired before either
one of us reach that doorway.

403
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,888
You're acting crazy.
Take your hands off of me!

404
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:51,393
Have you lost your natural mind?

405
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:53,795
Easy, there.

406
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,599
I will call the police in here!

407
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,868
Just give it to me.
Give it to me.

408
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,973
Stop her!

409
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,909
Get off of me!

410
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:09,048
Get off of me!
Get off!

411
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:23,263
- Dr. Oswald?
<i>- Yes?</i>

412
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:24,999
It's me, Frankie.

413
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:27,734
<i>Yes?</i>

414
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:30,236
Francine Murdoch?

415
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:32,540
Oh, Lucinda, yes, okay.

416
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,844
<i>Yeah. Look, Doc...</i>

417
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:37,547
I'm locked up.

418
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,326
They fittin' to put me in jail.

419
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:41,317
Yes?

420
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:43,586
<i>They're telling me that,
you know...</i>

421
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:45,655
Because of my history,

422
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:51,261
I could get myself out of here if
I check myself into the nuthouse.

423
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:57,068
<i>Under a 4011, maybe, yes...
Sure, but it depends on an assessment.</i>

424
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,204
Well, is that
something you can do?

425
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:02,675
What has happened?
Did you have another blackout?

426
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:06,680
<i>I don't know, Doc.
I don't know what happened.</i>

427
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,715
'Cause I think what I will do is

428
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:10,953
I will refer you
to Dr. Warren Backman.

429
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:14,855
He's the Chief Attendant Psychiatrist here,
and he's a clinician.

430
00:33:15,055 --> 00:33:16,845
<i>No. It's gonna
have to be you, Doc.</i>

431
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:19,828
But I don't have the time.

432
00:33:20,028 --> 00:33:22,604
I'm a research man.
I have students.

433
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:28,604
Please?

434
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,517
<i>There has to be
certain conditions.</i>

435
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,891
Okay. Shoot.

436
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:48,829
<i>You'll be signing yourself in voluntarily,
under my care.</i>

437
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,898
<i>Okay.
For how long?</i>

438
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:54,635
<i>Let's say,
to begin with, 30 days.</i>

439
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:56,505
<i>30 days!</i>

440
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:58,711
<i>Yeah, to begin with.</i>

441
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:06,283
<i>Okay. I guess it beats
being in jail, don't it?</i>

442
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:10,224
<i>I'm not that familiar with jails,
but, I suppose it does, yes.</i>

443
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,904
<i>I believe there is something
wrong with you, Miss Murdoch,</i>

444
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:27,408
<i>but we don't have any
idea what it could be.</i>

445
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:31,045
<i>Okay, Doc, but look,
you gonna have to be honest.</i>

446
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:33,035
<i>What do you think
is wrong with me?</i>

447
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:37,733
<i>Come over here
and we'll find out.</i>

448
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,105
This doesn't make sense.

449
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:54,610
Are you ambidextrous?

450
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,793
That's kind of personal for the first date.
Don't you think?

451
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:12,861
So look, if I'm gonna
be here for 30 days,

452
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:15,021
you gonna have to help me
out with something, Doc.

453
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,768
Because I'm about to go cold
turkey something fierce.

454
00:35:18,968 --> 00:35:20,208
Oh, I ain't talking about dope.

455
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:21,683
I'm talking about Ding Dongs.

456
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:23,941
- Ding Dongs?
- Yeah.

457
00:35:24,141 --> 00:35:28,746
You know, them little chocolate
cakes with the cream on the inside?

458
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:30,983
Do you know your IQ?

459
00:35:31,983 --> 00:35:33,887
They tell me it's pretty good.

460
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:34,920
Up around 130.

461
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,023
132.

462
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:40,860
Last year in March, when you checked
into Kedren Community Health,

463
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,597
you tested 156.

464
00:35:42,797 --> 00:35:44,682
That's pretty high, ain't it?

465
00:35:44,882 --> 00:35:46,568
Technically, it's genius.

466
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:48,936
What can I say,
my mama ain't raised no suckers.

467
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:51,140
No. You don't understand.

468
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,378
It's not possible to have such
wildly divergent results.

469
00:35:55,578 --> 00:35:59,366
Or if it is,
it's highly irregular.

470
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:03,155
And then a third time,
at Gateways,

471
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:05,657
you scored a little
better than average.

472
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:08,159
Guess they took one
look at a black stripper

473
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:10,262
and decided
she wasn't no Einstein.

474
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:13,265
Left-handed,
right-handed.

475
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:16,269
Nearsighted, 20/20 vision.

476
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:18,905
Blood-pressure,
120 over 80.

477
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:20,590
Hold on, Doc.

478
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,075
Enough about me.

479
00:36:22,275 --> 00:36:24,381
How about we talk
about you for a second.

480
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:29,954
When did she leave?

481
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:31,955
What?

482
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,222
Your wife.

483
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:36,227
When did she leave you?

484
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:40,598
I noticed you got you a tan line on
your ring finger but it's faint.

485
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:44,969
So that tells me you didn't just
take that off before work today.

486
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,205
It's been off.

487
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:47,740
That's very observant.

488
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,943
I grew up in Georgia
in the '50s.

489
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:53,282
You learn to pay
attention to skin color.

490
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:57,985
So how's that
going for you, Doc?

491
00:36:58,185 --> 00:36:59,133
On the way home...

492
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:04,893
Stop by the grocery,
pick you up a tuna on rye,

493
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:06,261
a fifth of whiskey?

494
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:08,129
It's kind of lonely, ain't it?

495
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:11,968
You really don't have
to do this, you know.

496
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:15,739
There's no stigma attached to mental illness.
At least, not here.

497
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:17,518
So you don't have to be afraid.

498
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:22,781
Tell me what do you remember
about your arrest?

499
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:25,451
You were picked up
at the Ambassador Hotel.

500
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:27,620
You got into a fight.

501
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,399
Why were you at the Ambassador?

502
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:33,893
Checked into
the Presidential Suite.

503
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:35,796
Heard it was real nice.

504
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:39,367
Before you went,
did you have any auditory hallucinations?

505
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:41,002
Any what?

506
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:44,202
Voices telling you
what to do? Delusions?

507
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:46,141
- You mean voices in my head?
- Yes.

508
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,611
Like talking to me?

509
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:51,181
Hell, no!
What do you think, I'm crazy?

510
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:53,617
Any feelings of paranoia

511
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:56,153
- or visual hallucinations?
- No.

512
00:37:56,353 --> 00:37:58,301
How long have you
had these blackouts?

513
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:01,259
Waking up in unfamiliar places?

514
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,662
I don't know.

515
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,498
Since your late teens,
early 20s?

516
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:08,035
I don't know.

517
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:10,269
Try to remember...

518
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:13,510
Do you remember what you felt
before you decided to go?

519
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,045
Do you know why you wanted to go to
the Ambassador in the first place?

520
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:19,140
I don't remember!

521
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:24,802
Could you sit
over there, please.

522
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:28,527
I'll check your
ocular responses.

523
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:32,365
Look at me, please.

524
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:37,570
Look at my eyes...
Look at my eyes.

525
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,840
Very good.

526
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Look at me.

527
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:54,322
Miss? Hello, miss,
can you hear me? Miss?

528
00:38:54,522 --> 00:38:55,358
Look at me.

529
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:00,253
Do you have feelings
of dissociation?

530
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,331
<i>Miss?</i>

531
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:04,331
<i>You all right?</i>

532
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:07,608
<i>Miss?</i>

533
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:13,680
Nurse Freeman will
take you to your room.

534
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,952
I need some time alone
with your file.

535
00:39:19,952 --> 00:39:21,854
Shut your face!
Shut it!

536
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:24,559
You never answered my question.

537
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,429
Do you ever have a
feeling of dissociation

538
00:39:29,629 --> 00:39:31,999
of being outside yourself?

539
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:36,547
Watching yourself perform actions
from an objective remove?

540
00:39:44,547 --> 00:39:46,432
Honey,
I picked out clothes for you.

541
00:39:46,632 --> 00:39:48,518
These oughta be
just about your size.

542
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:50,907
Don't you ever dare touch me!

543
00:39:51,107 --> 00:39:53,297
And I choose what I wear.

544
00:39:58,297 --> 00:39:59,297
Miss Murdoch?

545
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:03,518
You left your cigarettes.

546
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,349
I don't ever smoke, Doctor.

547
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:44,320
<i>Tuna, right?
I got tuna for Dr. Oz.</i>

548
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:49,057
What else is good?

549
00:40:49,257 --> 00:40:52,293
Ham salad, very good.
Chicken salad, very good.

550
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:53,757
Cheese salad, very good.

551
00:40:56,297 --> 00:40:57,297
- Tuna?
- Tuna, yes.

552
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,577
<i>If you were to
go to sleep one night</i>

553
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:39,550
<i>and awake to find,
that by some unknown agency</i>

554
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:45,022
<i>you had been transported
to a cold, dark cave,</i>

555
00:41:45,222 --> 00:41:50,164
<i>the rational mind provides for one
of only five possible explanations.</i>

556
00:41:53,164 --> 00:41:55,402
<i>One, "I'm dead."</i>

557
00:41:56,402 --> 00:41:59,506
<i>Two, "I'm dreaming."</i>

558
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:02,045
<i>Three, "Somebody
played a trick on me."</i>

559
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:07,583
<i>Four, "I'm crazy."</i>

560
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,885
<i>Or?</i>

561
00:42:11,085 --> 00:42:12,321
<i>Or, five...</i>

562
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:15,390
<i>"I am in a cave."</i>

563
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,396
Oh, I get it, Doc.
You're trying to say I'm crazy.

564
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:22,133
Or somebody
played a trick on you.

565
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,588
Who?

566
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:26,576
You.

567
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:33,284
If you trust me,
there's something I'd like to try.

568
00:42:38,284 --> 00:42:41,655
Actually,
I spent most of the 1950s,

569
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:45,226
1954 to 1962 to
be exact, on acid.

570
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:46,361
Say what?

571
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:49,231
LSD.
It's a synthetic hallucinogen.

572
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:50,431
I know what LSD is.

573
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:54,672
You just don't seem
like that kind of dude.

574
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:58,908
"Turn on, tune in, drop out."

575
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:01,344
It was nothing like that.

576
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:02,946
I was investigating

577
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:08,487
the phenomenological effects
of LSD-25 on consciousness.

578
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,109
We were among the first
in the world to try it.

579
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:17,333
It was a rigorous study.

580
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,952
We tested over 900 patients.

581
00:43:22,152 --> 00:43:24,571
Yeah, by getting folks high?

582
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:28,044
Well, it was
a scientific experiment.

583
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:32,918
So basically, what you're saying is you
was responsible for the Grateful Dead?

584
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:38,360
I guess I was.

585
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,282
Doc, you got them Ding Dongs?

586
00:43:47,482 --> 00:43:49,362
This is just a mild sedative...

587
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:51,442
To aid with hypnotic suggestion.

588
00:43:55,442 --> 00:43:59,914
I want you to follow
the light with your eyes.

589
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:04,422
And, as you do so,
focus solely on the light.

590
00:44:07,422 --> 00:44:08,864
You're drifting away.

591
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:15,469
There's nothing but the light.

592
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:19,575
You're drifting away.

593
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:24,280
Nothing but the light.

594
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,594
<i>Hey, Frankie.</i>

595
00:45:00,018 --> 00:45:02,454
Frankie?

596
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:04,460
<i>Nod your head
if you can hear me?</i>

597
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,567
<i>Good.</i>

598
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:15,871
There's someone else
I'd like to meet.

599
00:45:16,871 --> 00:45:18,762
Is that possible?

600
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:39,146
Hello.

601
00:45:39,346 --> 00:45:40,731
Hi.

602
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:45,003
You're like that wizard from Oz

603
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:47,840
where Dorothy
fell upon that witch?

604
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,193
You like that film?

605
00:45:50,393 --> 00:45:51,746
I read the book.

606
00:45:52,746 --> 00:45:53,882
I read books.

607
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:56,652
That's good.

608
00:45:58,652 --> 00:46:01,456
How long you going
to keep her here?

609
00:46:01,656 --> 00:46:03,426
Who? Lucinda or Frankie?

610
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:07,931
From the Latin,<i> lucidus via lucere,
meaning, "To shine."</i>

611
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:11,335
An origin it shares
with the word "lucid"

612
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,272
meaning "to think
or see clearly."

613
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,341
I'm not keeping her here.

614
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,541
She's here of her own accord.
I'm just trying to help her.

615
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,585
Nobody ever care about Frankie.

616
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:26,585
Except for Mama.

617
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:29,890
And Mr. Pete.

618
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,563
But you try to
help her, don't you?

619
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:36,766
When I can.

620
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:39,568
What stops you?

621
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,914
It's getting dark in here.

622
00:46:50,914 --> 00:46:52,664
Want me to open the blinds?

623
00:47:04,664 --> 00:47:07,103
Here. Have some water.

624
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,143
Good Lord.

625
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:18,179
Thank you.

626
00:47:24,154 --> 00:47:26,624
May I ask who I'm speaking with?

627
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:31,094
Well, you never end a sentence
with a preposition, Doctor.

628
00:47:31,294 --> 00:47:33,733
Isn't that what
we were taught in school?

629
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:37,672
You know who I am.

630
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:42,577
That puts me at a slight
disadvantage, doesn't it?

631
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:46,751
Yes, it surely does.

632
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:55,123
Maybe Miss Murdoch would be kind enough
to make our introduction next time.

633
00:47:55,323 --> 00:47:57,218
That's quite slippery
of you, Doctor.

634
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:03,934
That is a trait that's
common to your race.

635
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:05,924
You don't deny
that you are Hebrew?

636
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:09,007
No.

637
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:13,644
Well, at any rate,
she won't be able to make an introduction,

638
00:48:13,844 --> 00:48:16,514
because she won't remember
a word of our encounter.

639
00:48:16,714 --> 00:48:18,516
Oh? How's that?

640
00:48:18,716 --> 00:48:20,319
She's weak.

641
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:21,989
She's frightened.

642
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:25,025
She's incapable.

643
00:48:26,025 --> 00:48:29,179
Is there anything
she has trouble accepting?

644
00:48:29,379 --> 00:48:32,534
Something that happened
a long time ago?

645
00:48:32,734 --> 00:48:34,035
In my experience,

646
00:48:34,235 --> 00:48:38,541
doctors are almost
always tiresome bores

647
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:40,844
and frequently drunks.

648
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:41,778
Oh?

649
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:44,855
Which one are you, Dr. Oswald?

650
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:08,978
Are you gonna be working late?

651
00:49:11,813 --> 00:49:13,315
Well, good night.

652
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:14,717
Good night.

653
00:50:07,913 --> 00:50:10,615
Don't you all
wanna watch something good?

654

Schizophrenia?

00:51:01,342 --> 00:51:03,761
Or manic depression, possibly.

669
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:06,180
We might start her on lithium.

670
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,952
I know what it is.
That's not the problem at all.

671
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:12,121
She has a dissociative identity disorder.
It's really quite extreme.

672
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:13,789
MPD?

673
00:51:17,193 --> 00:51:19,597
Under hypnosis
and pentobarbital sedation...

674
00:51:19,797 --> 00:51:22,833
she presented two quite
distinct and consistent alters.

675
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:25,472
Really? Quite a girl.

676
00:51:26,472 --> 00:51:28,607
Yeah.

677
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:31,487
How can you be sure that it wasn't
a transient ego-state phenomenon?

678
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,579
A mood swing?

679
00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:34,715
The girl is a pothead.

680
00:51:34,915 --> 00:51:35,848
I was there.

681
00:51:36,048 --> 00:51:38,719
Might she be responding
to your own suggestion?

682
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:40,498
You know I'm wary of hypnosis.

683
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:43,301
I haven't told her yet.

684
00:51:49,298 --> 00:51:50,869
Multiple personality?

685
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:55,039
Who are they?

686
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:58,141
They're you,
they're aspects of you,

687
00:51:58,341 --> 00:51:59,476
your subconscious.

688
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:02,580
Okay, but why?

689
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,753
Well, that's what
we have to find out.

690
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:09,187
Okay, so what you're saying is

691
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:12,291
I got all these different people livin'
inside me, right?

692
00:52:12,491 --> 00:52:14,127
But I don't know who they are?

693
00:52:14,327 --> 00:52:19,133
Well, we all have different
personalities and different selves

694
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:24,139
"Do I contradict myself?
Very well, then, I contradict myself.

695
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:26,911
"I am large.
I contain multitudes."

696
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:30,314
It's Whitman.

697
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:34,818
Oh, I know who it is.
He was a racist fag.

698
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,896
Well, I don't think
that covers him entirely.

699
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:45,966
Well...

700
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:49,202
At least you ain't been
wasting your time, Doc.

701
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:51,245
'Cause I'm crazy
as a shithouse rat.

702
00:53:12,396 --> 00:53:14,202
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey, Maxine, it's me.</i>

703
00:53:18,202 --> 00:53:19,169
Frankie?

704
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:21,406
<i>Hey, Mama.</i>

705
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:23,909
<i>You still wearing
that necklace I gave you?</i>

706
00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:25,980
Oh, of course I am!

707
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,416
Where have you been?

708
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,454
I needed to take
a little break, Mama,

709
00:53:33,454 --> 00:53:35,023
so I went down to Florida.

710
00:53:36,023 --> 00:53:37,159
<i>Oh.</i>

711
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:40,130
That sounds real nice.

712
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,130
<i>Take care of yourself,
baby, all right?</i>

713
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:46,269
<i>Okay, Mama.</i>

714
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:48,974
<i>I will.</i>

715
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:09,062
Well, Doctor?

716
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:12,233
Again, I find myself unable
to properly address you.

717
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:13,767
<i>No names.</i>

718
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:16,670
<i>A little mystery adds spice,
don't you think?</i>

719
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:19,374
<i>Now, Doctor,</i>

720
00:54:19,574 --> 00:54:22,377
I sincerely hope
I didn't offend you

721
00:54:22,577 --> 00:54:25,115
when I made that
reference to your religion

722
00:54:25,315 --> 00:54:30,688
but I was bewildered by whatever that
was you'd administered that girl.

723
00:54:30,888 --> 00:54:32,328
You feel the effects
of the sedative?

724
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:33,490
Of course!

725
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,429
I suffer every abuse
she inflicts on this body.

726
00:54:37,629 --> 00:54:39,297
Frankie likes to drink,
doesn't she?

727
00:54:39,497 --> 00:54:40,899
She certainly does.

728
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:44,153
At least her taste
runs to bourbon.

729
00:54:44,353 --> 00:54:47,181
It's that vile marijuana
I can't stand.

730
00:54:47,381 --> 00:54:50,010
Do you think it's got
something to do with,

731
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:54,615
something she's trying to cover up,
some bad feelings about the past, or...

732
00:54:54,815 --> 00:54:58,288
Doctor, do we have
to talk about her?

733
00:54:59,288 --> 00:55:01,490
Let's talk about your wife.

734
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,561
Or don't you want
to talk about that?

735
00:55:05,561 --> 00:55:08,300
No, it's fine.

736
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,458
We weren't compatible.

737
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:16,175
Did you learn this from Frankie?

738
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:19,746
Well, that girl does know how to read a man,
I have to give her that.

739
00:55:19,946 --> 00:55:23,048
And she ought to,
considering her occupation.

740
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:25,051
You find her promiscuous?

741
00:55:25,251 --> 00:55:29,190
Well, now that's a fancy
word for an ugly tendency.

742
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,759
But you're different
from her in that respect?

743
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:35,229
Why, Dr. Oswald,

744
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:38,635
whatever do you hope to imply?

745
00:55:40,635 --> 00:55:44,073
I have nothing in common
with that girl...

746
00:55:44,273 --> 00:55:49,748
Except the unfortunate situation
of having to share this body.

747
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:53,450
And we'll see
how long that lasts

748
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:58,257
because I'm getting tired
of having to step in for her.

749
00:55:58,457 --> 00:56:01,361
Suffer her hangovers.

750
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:04,134
The smell of her encounters
still on the sheets.

751
00:56:06,134 --> 00:56:08,802
They actually smell different
from you and me.

752
00:56:09,002 --> 00:56:10,440
Don't you find that?

753
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,307
You mean black people?

754
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:15,784
Negroes... Yes.

755
00:56:21,784 --> 00:56:26,791
Did you know that one of them claimed
in a book that Beethoven was a colored?

756
00:56:29,827 --> 00:56:31,565
Beethoven!

757
00:56:33,565 --> 00:56:38,204
I'd like you to tell me
a little about Paige Prescott.

758
00:56:38,404 --> 00:56:41,742
I tried calling her family,
but they weren't prepared to talk to me.

759
00:56:41,942 --> 00:56:45,780
Well that family has an inflated
sense of its own importance.

760
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,248
But you attended her wedding,
didn't you?

761
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:50,554
At the Ambassador Hotel?

762
00:56:52,554 --> 00:56:55,092
Looks like rain.

763
00:56:56,092 --> 00:56:57,660
All right.

764
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,465
Tell me about Mr. Pete.

765
00:57:01,465 --> 00:57:03,150
Did you know him
back in Georgia?

766
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,240
Did he do something to Frankie?

767
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,125
She wasn't fit
to lick his boots.

768
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,661
So they knew each other?

769
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:28,661
How sad.

770
00:57:33,268 --> 00:57:34,268
I was right.

771
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,322
You're just a bore.

772
00:57:54,393 --> 00:57:55,729
<i>She thinks she's white?</i>

773
00:57:55,929 --> 00:57:58,464
<i>Well, one of her multiples does.</i>

774
00:57:58,664 --> 00:58:00,668
<i>It's the child I want
to try to reach.</i>

775
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:02,336
She's a helper.

776
00:58:03,336 --> 00:58:06,075
She's very smart.

777
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:11,246
The woman, on the other hand,
who thinks she's white,

778
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,184
she's far too strong.
She's a problem.

779
00:58:14,384 --> 00:58:18,254
I thought the county
sent her to us under 4011.6.

780
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:20,657
It says here, the charges
against her have been dropped?

781
00:58:20,857 --> 00:58:22,394
I'm working on having her sign

782
00:58:22,594 --> 00:58:25,496
a 6000 voluntary admission,
but I don't want to rush it.

783
00:58:25,696 --> 00:58:28,984
I don't want any of the alters
to walk out on me.

784
00:58:29,184 --> 00:58:32,472
And you're certain she's
not just making this up?

785
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:35,709
<i>Well...</i>

786
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:38,378
<i>You said it yourself.
She's intelligent, imaginative...</i>

787
00:58:38,578 --> 00:58:40,080
<i>No.</i>

788
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,585
Girl, your head looks
just like a feather bed.

789
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:46,022
Come on.

790
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,258
Pretty girl like you oughta
make something of herself.

791
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:51,938
Come on now, when's the last time
you combed through this hair?

792
00:58:52,027 --> 00:58:53,696
What medication
do you have her on?

793
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:57,250
Nothing. Just the sedative
when I induce hypnosis.

794
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,604
I don't want anything
to interfere with her therapy.

795
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:04,509
The wrong medication could
cause an alter to predominate.

796
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:06,544
Then what happens to Murdoch?

797
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,650
- If an alter predominates?
- Yeah.

798
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,452
She'd no longer be Murdoch.

799
00:59:14,454 --> 00:59:16,289
Sit down.

800
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:17,624
Hi!

801
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:19,260
You ever had a flip?

802
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,261
My friend.

803
00:59:20,461 --> 00:59:23,265
Just bring it down...

804
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:26,501
I'll get my iron, we'll straighten
this out and just flip it back.

805
00:59:26,701 --> 00:59:28,336
That's my friend, Frankie.

806
00:59:28,536 --> 00:59:29,839
That's gonna
look so nice on you.

807
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:32,475
<i>This one goes way back to 1957.</i>

808
00:59:32,675 --> 00:59:35,779
It'll make you
feel better, to do your hair.

809
00:59:35,979 --> 00:59:37,779
You know you got a pretty face.

810
00:59:37,815 --> 00:59:41,052
If I had a face like yours,
you know my hair would be straight.

811
00:59:41,252 --> 00:59:43,042
It's gonna look
a whole lot better.

812
00:59:46,925 --> 00:59:49,695
Afterwards,
it gets tight like this.

813
00:59:57,672 --> 01:00:01,672
I'm gonna get my iron. You're gonna look
real nice. You're gonna feel better.

814
01:00:13,824 --> 01:00:15,936
Shh!

815
01:00:24,936 --> 01:00:26,906
What are you doing?

816
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:28,876
This is my brother!

817
01:00:29,076 --> 01:00:31,577
Get out my house,
you filthy degenerate!

818
01:00:31,777 --> 01:00:34,615
<i>Get out! Get out! Get out!</i>

819
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:36,615
Make you feel good?

820
01:00:41,123 --> 01:00:42,891
Bonnie! Eva!

821
01:00:43,091 --> 01:00:44,463
Peter!

822
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,863
Code green!

823
01:00:48,063 --> 01:00:49,434
Eva, get some help!

824
01:00:56,072 --> 01:00:57,445
Get your filthy...

825
01:01:01,445 --> 01:01:03,115
Stop! Stop!

826
01:01:03,315 --> 01:01:04,518
Stop!

827
01:01:11,492 --> 01:01:14,862
Miss Murdoch!
You're gonna have to control yourself!

828
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:22,704
Subdue her! Subdue her!

829
01:01:38,423 --> 01:01:43,663
"No man could bind him, no,
not with chains..."

830
01:01:43,863 --> 01:01:46,533
Keep the area around her clear!

831
01:01:46,733 --> 01:01:48,652
Miss Murdoch,
I need you to calm down.

832
01:01:48,852 --> 01:01:50,771
"Bound with
fetters and chains..."

833
01:01:50,971 --> 01:01:52,372
Come on, give it to me now!

834
01:01:52,572 --> 01:01:54,608
"The chains
were plucked asunder by..."

835
01:01:54,808 --> 01:01:57,078
Hold her still.
There you go. Okay.

836
01:01:57,278 --> 01:02:00,368
"The fetters torn
him to pieces..."

837
01:02:00,568 --> 01:02:03,659
"Neither could
any man tame him."

838
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:10,394
Is everyone okay?

839
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:12,563
Let's get her back to her room.

840
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:13,563
Everybody, now.

841
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,501
Nurse, please?

842
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:24,944
It was like she was
a whole other person.

843
01:02:25,144 --> 01:02:26,780
<i>She just went off on me.</i>

844
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,832
<i>- What triggered the switch?
- I don't know.</i>

845
01:02:29,032 --> 01:02:30,885
<i>- What made her attack?
- I don't know.</i>

846
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:31,885
<i>Think!</i>

847
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:33,086
<i>We had the radio playing.</i>

848
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:34,555
<i>What was it?</i>

849
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:37,960
<i>It was some old song.
I can't remember.</i>

850
01:02:39,996 --> 01:02:40,996
What?

851
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,070
What is it?

852
01:02:50,007 --> 01:02:51,789
Frankie?

853
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:03,789
Mr. Oz?

854
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:07,559
Mr. Oz?

855
01:03:08,028 --> 01:03:09,065
Hello, Genius!

856
01:03:11,065 --> 01:03:13,601
I hope you don't
mind if I call you that?

857
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:15,321
That's a mighty big name.

858
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:17,041
You're a very smart kid.

859
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:21,845
Now, there's a game
I'd like you to play.

860
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:25,119
I did notice that you have a squint,
so I got you these.

861
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:29,720
It's a writing game.

862
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,756
You like words, don't you?

863
01:03:31,956 --> 01:03:35,726
I want you to think of words
that mean something to Frankie.

864
01:03:35,926 --> 01:03:39,731
I want you to write them down for me.
Can you do that?

865
01:03:39,931 --> 01:03:43,072
Think of words and names,
like Mr. Pete.

866
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:48,477
What?

867
01:03:48,677 --> 01:03:50,328
Did he hurt Frankie?

868
01:03:50,528 --> 01:03:52,179
He hurt her real bad.

869
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:59,656
Ain't nobody ever hurt Frankie
like Mr. Pete did.

870
01:03:59,856 --> 01:04:02,962
What about the woman I've been talking to?
The Southern one?

871
01:04:03,726 --> 01:04:04,726
You know her name?

872
01:04:09,067 --> 01:04:10,904
You know her name?

873
01:04:18,945 --> 01:04:20,780
- Sorry!
- I ain't done with that!

874
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,780
Thank you!

875
01:04:25,085 --> 01:04:27,326
Here. Write her name.

876
01:04:59,326 --> 01:05:00,777
"Alice."

877
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:30,995
<i>"This contract is
an agreement between you,</i>

878

886
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:05,278
She's her usual
charming self this morning.

887
01:06:19,085 --> 01:06:20,655
Coffee?

888
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:24,197
Why, thank you, Doctor.
Just set it right over there.

889
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:31,133
What's the matter?

890
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:33,402
You don't quite seem
yourself this morning.

891
01:06:33,602 --> 01:06:35,705
I want you to
tell me about Pete.

892
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:38,025
I think he hurt Frankie
and I think you know about it.

893
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:39,978
And I want to know how and why.

894
01:06:41,378 --> 01:06:43,180
How sweet.

895
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,251
You've been talking
to that child, I see.

896
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:50,858
Well, I'm sure
I'll take care of that.

897
01:06:51,858 --> 01:06:54,260
You look tired.

898
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:57,166
Were you up all night,
thinking about your wife?

899
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:01,275
Or is it somebody new?

900
01:07:06,275 --> 01:07:10,347
Well, now, I don't mean
to be ungrateful, Doctor,

901
01:07:10,547 --> 01:07:16,186
but why would I waste a second
of my time to help her?

902
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:19,124
What do you mean "ungrateful"?

903
01:07:19,324 --> 01:07:22,295
Well, for all the help
you've given me.

904
01:07:23,295 --> 01:07:25,199
I think it's this place.

905
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:28,001
Poor thing's gettin' tired.

906
01:07:29,001 --> 01:07:33,941
She's findin' it harder
and harder to cope.

907
01:07:34,141 --> 01:07:37,277
I don't know how much longer
she can go on fightin' with me.

908
01:07:37,477 --> 01:07:39,280
Alice...

909
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,417
You gotta see who you are.

910
01:07:41,617 --> 01:07:43,853
You're black, you're not white.

911
01:07:44,053 --> 01:07:45,889
You're her, and she's you.

912
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:49,496
Well, then who am I looking at?

913
01:07:53,496 --> 01:07:57,434
You don't mean to tell me you're
taking the side of a common donkey?

914
01:07:57,634 --> 01:08:00,873
Nobody's taking anybody's sides.
This is not a fight.

915
01:08:01,073 --> 01:08:02,841
It's not a battle you can win.

916
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:07,951
Well, I promise you, Doctor,
it's not a battle I will ever let her win.

917
01:08:10,951 --> 01:08:13,320
I have a contract here,
I want you to sign.

918
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,899
It sets out some provisions...

919
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,935
Doc?

920
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,270
Frankie?

921
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,440
I can hear her in my head.

922
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,440
You can?

923
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:35,247
That's good.

924
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,286
That's fantastic, Frankie.

925
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:42,320
That's fantastic.

926
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,690
We're getting there, Frankie.

927
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:47,060
- We're getting there.
- Yeah.

928
01:09:25,305 --> 01:09:27,406
<i>"I, the patient,</i>

Hello, Martha?
Is this a message machine?

936
01:09:55,606 --> 01:09:59,012
I know it's late,
but I was thinking of something you said...

937
01:10:00,012 --> 01:10:03,149
No, I wasn't thinking,
I was feeling.

938
01:10:03,349 --> 01:10:04,149
I was feeling.

939
01:10:05,019 --> 01:10:07,488
But then, on the one level,
cognitively,

940
01:10:07,688 --> 01:10:09,958
there's very little
to distinguish

941
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:13,161
between the processes of
thinking and feeling, and...

942
01:10:13,361 --> 01:10:14,431
It's Oz.

943
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:19,135
No, I'll start all over again.

944
01:10:20,603 --> 01:10:22,541
What I wanted to say is that...

945
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:28,479
Whoever it is that
you wanted me to be...

946
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:31,650
I think I'm prepared
to be him now.

947
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:34,650
For you.

948
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:48,467
What?

949
01:10:55,278 --> 01:10:56,313
Thank you.

950
01:10:57,313 --> 01:10:59,385
Francine. Good morning.

951
01:11:01,385 --> 01:11:05,088
I am Warren Backman and I am
here to make my evaluation.

952
01:11:05,288 --> 01:11:06,290
Evaluation?

953
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:09,076
Yes, I was hoping
that we might start off

954
01:11:09,276 --> 01:11:11,863
with a few simple tests,
if you don't mind?

955
01:11:12,063 --> 01:11:15,234
Okay, but who the fuck are you?

956
01:11:15,434 --> 01:11:17,576
I'm the Chief Psychiatrist
here. Okay?

957
01:11:22,576 --> 01:11:24,512
Just tell me what you see.

958
01:11:24,712 --> 01:11:26,647
I see a honky
in a piss-ugly suit.

959
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:28,516
Now would you please
go get my doctor.

960
01:11:28,716 --> 01:11:30,185
'Cause he wants me
to sign this shit

961
01:11:30,385 --> 01:11:32,105
and I don't even know
what the hell this is.

962
01:11:32,253 --> 01:11:35,324
Look, Francine.
I'm not obliged to keep you in here.

963
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:38,395
Now, I don't want you out
on the streets causing havoc.

964
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:41,356
And I don't wanna release you if
you're gonna be a danger to yourself,

965
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:43,638
but how am I supposed to judge
the level of care you need

966
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:45,369
if you won't cooperate with me?

967
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:47,404
I got a court order, don't I?

968
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:49,406
I'm supposed to be up in here.

969
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:51,609
Well, no, that's not true.

970
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:53,613
Those charges were dropped.

971
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:56,555
Dr. Oswald should have
explained that to you.

972
01:12:02,555 --> 01:12:04,899
You lied to me!

973
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:37,267
Nurse Shaw!

974
01:13:37,467 --> 01:13:40,070
Love can hurt, can't it?

975
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:43,307
He didn't abuse her.
She loved him!

976
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:44,642
I've been an idiot.

977
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:47,814
Too literal.
Far too literal again!

978
01:13:48,814 --> 01:13:49,814
What?

979
01:13:51,417 --> 01:13:52,618
See how that goes.

980
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:59,293
You discharged a patient
under my care.

981
01:13:59,493 --> 01:14:00,727
You had no right to do that.

982
01:14:00,927 --> 01:14:03,848
Dr. Oswald, maybe this could
wait until later in my office...

983
01:14:04,048 --> 01:14:06,960
She was a patient at this hospital.
She was deep in therapy!

984
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,751
She was an outpatient at this hospital,
Joe, and you knew that.

985
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:12,542
Now, why didn't you tell your
patient that she was free to go?

986
01:14:12,742 --> 01:14:14,742
Because it had to
be handled carefully!

987
01:14:19,449 --> 01:14:22,620
I'd drawn up a contract
I wanted them each to sign.

988
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:26,458
You were waiting for her
multiples to give you the okay?

989
01:14:26,658 --> 01:14:29,762
Well, of course! How else was I
going to get them to cooperate?

990
01:14:29,962 --> 01:14:33,173
Well, did you plan on having
their lawyers look it over first?

991
01:14:35,002 --> 01:14:38,755
That's an incredibly unimaginative
way of looking at it.

992
01:15:01,699 --> 01:15:03,587
Her address is on file.

993
01:15:03,787 --> 01:15:05,675
And her next of kin.

994
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:11,953
Probably too many previous
employments to be any use, but...

995
01:15:46,953 --> 01:15:48,839
Some white guy here.

996
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:50,926
Has something happened?

997
01:15:51,926 --> 01:15:53,695
Is it the police?

998
01:15:55,695 --> 01:15:56,695
I doubt it.

999
01:16:00,101 --> 01:16:02,871
<i>I didn't know
she was seeing a psychiatrist.</i>

1000
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:05,275
How could she afford it?

1001
01:16:05,475 --> 01:16:08,835
Well, technically the State was paying for
her treatment while she was under my care.

1002
01:16:08,836 --> 01:16:11,748
- What's wrong with her?
- There ain't nothing wrong with her.

1003
01:16:11,948 --> 01:16:14,985
She just has these spells and the
child gets agitated sometimes.

1004
01:16:15,185 --> 01:16:18,080
She's been like that, though,
ever since she was a girl.

1005
01:16:19,724 --> 01:16:21,559
I really have to find her.

1006
01:16:21,759 --> 01:16:23,395
We ain't seen her in a while.

1007
01:16:23,595 --> 01:16:25,631
Last I heard,
she was some place down in Florida...

1008
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:26,779
She was just here.

1009
01:16:28,424 --> 01:16:30,003
She flew in here this morning.

1010
01:16:30,203 --> 01:16:32,507
She had one of
her crazy moods on.

1011
01:16:32,707 --> 01:16:35,844
She was asking for money
and saying that we owed her,

1012
01:16:36,044 --> 01:16:37,124
and then she went for Mama.

1013
01:16:37,245 --> 01:16:38,285
Show the man what she did!

1014
01:16:38,286 --> 01:16:39,920
She just wanted the necklace,
that's all.

1015
01:16:40,081 --> 01:16:41,561
She wanted the necklace
and I told her

1016
01:16:41,716 --> 01:16:43,619
she couldn't afford it
when she gave it to me.

1017
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:48,123
Mama, she had her hands around your
throat and she wouldn't let go!

1018
01:16:48,323 --> 01:16:50,560
- Stop it!
- Why do you keep defending her?

1019
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,497
She's my daughter!

1020
01:16:52,697 --> 01:16:56,568
Actually, in a sense, the one who
attacked you is not your daughter.

1021
01:16:56,768 --> 01:16:59,638
Frankie has a very
particular condition.

1022
01:16:59,838 --> 01:17:02,508
It's brought on
by repressed trauma.

1023
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:05,211
I believe it has something
to do with a man she knew.

1024
01:17:05,411 --> 01:17:06,411
A Pete, a Mr. Pete.

1025
01:17:09,283 --> 01:17:10,451
Do you know him?

1026
01:17:10,651 --> 01:17:12,103
He died, Dr. Oswald.

1027
01:17:12,303 --> 01:17:14,146
He died a long time ago.

1028
01:17:14,346 --> 01:17:15,990
That was God's will.

1029
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:18,860
They was trying to live
between two worlds.

1030
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:21,229
Wouldn't have fitted
in neither one.

1031
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:23,536
Are you saying he was white?

1032
01:17:25,536 --> 01:17:26,536
It's over now.

1033
01:17:31,275 --> 01:17:34,378
And now it's time
for you to leave.

1034
01:17:34,578 --> 01:17:37,482
With all respect, it's not over.

1035
01:17:37,682 --> 01:17:39,762
It's not over for Frankie
and I'm trying to help her.

1036
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:40,752
And I'm not?

1037
01:17:42,655 --> 01:17:45,926
I've always tried to do
what was best for Frankie.

1038
01:17:46,126 --> 01:17:48,596
I've only done what was right.

1039
01:17:48,796 --> 01:17:52,935
Whatever happened, this,
her illness, it's not your fault.

1040
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:56,974
If she tries to
contact you again...

1041
01:17:57,974 --> 01:18:00,553
Or if you could tell me
where she last held a job,

1042
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,596
I would appreciate it.

1043
01:18:17,596 --> 01:18:20,167
She works at the phone
company over in Inglewood.

1044
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:22,654
Thank you.

1045
01:18:22,854 --> 01:18:24,342
No, she don't.

1046
01:18:28,342 --> 01:18:31,012
Better get you a pencil
and draw you a map.

1047
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:34,897
You don't look like the kind of man
who would know where this place is.

1048
01:18:36,885 --> 01:18:40,289
Yeah!
You feeling groovy out there?

1049
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:44,061
I never touched the guy!

1050
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,631
What do I look like?
Do I look retarded?

1051
01:18:46,831 --> 01:18:49,333
You were on your knees with
a nice dick in your mouth!

1052
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:51,703
Well I never
touched him with my hand.

1053
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,256
Come on, Hal.
Give her a break.

1054
01:18:53,456 --> 01:18:54,878
- Go on.
- We're outta here.

1055
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:59,111
Ooh!

1056
01:18:59,311 --> 01:19:01,431
Hello, handsome.

1057
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,752
I need a smoke.

1058
01:19:04,752 --> 01:19:06,788
- You Vice?
- No.

1059
01:19:06,988 --> 01:19:09,056
I'm looking for
Francine Murdoch.

1060
01:19:09,256 --> 01:19:10,593
- Who?
- Francine Murdoch.

1061
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:12,162
She works here, or used to.

1062
01:19:15,131 --> 01:19:16,983
I'm her psychiatrist.

1063
01:19:17,183 --> 01:19:18,836
Oh, you mean Frankie.

1064
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:21,538
She was definitely a whack job.

1065
01:19:21,738 --> 01:19:25,243
Good moves, great tits,
but pure psycho.

1066
01:19:25,443 --> 01:19:27,180
Do you know where she might be?

1067
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,349
Can you tell me?
It's important.

1068
01:19:31,549 --> 01:19:33,585
She might be over in Lakewood.

1069
01:19:33,785 --> 01:19:35,622
She might be in Venice Beach.

1070
01:19:35,822 --> 01:19:39,124
She might be in Philly,
taking cookies to her sick grandmother.

1071
01:19:39,324 --> 01:19:43,305
Now, would you mind getting out of my
place of work. I got things to do...

1072
01:19:50,305 --> 01:19:53,109
You looking for Frankie?

1073
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:55,247
You're a doctor?
A head doctor?

1074
01:19:58,247 --> 01:20:00,149
Do you know where
she liked to go?

1075
01:20:00,349 --> 01:20:01,651
Maybe some place unusual?

1076
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:05,090
Someplace she normally
wouldn't be found dead in?

1077
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:07,228
She's sick?
I mean, mentally?

1078
01:20:09,076 --> 01:20:11,129
You're gonna fix her, right?
You better!

1079
01:20:11,329 --> 01:20:15,119
Try to think of a place she might go
when she wasn't acting like herself.

1080
01:20:19,038 --> 01:20:21,275
<i>We like to call
our servants "staff."</i>

1081
01:20:21,475 --> 01:20:24,244
Quite often, we would
treat them like family.

1082
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:28,051
Wait, Alice. Maybe I knew your aunt.
Why, sure I did.

1083
01:20:30,051 --> 01:20:31,051
Jemima?

1084
01:20:33,489 --> 01:20:35,759
Or perhaps it was your uncle.

1085
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:38,229
Did you have an uncle named Tom?

1086
01:20:41,998 --> 01:20:44,985
Thank you for my drinks,
gentlemen, but I...

1087
01:20:45,185 --> 01:20:47,973
Hey hey, Alice, wait.
I was only fooling.

1088
01:20:48,173 --> 01:20:50,013
- Excuse me.
- You haven't finished your drink.

1089
01:20:50,014 --> 01:20:50,895
Sit down.

1090
01:20:51,095 --> 01:20:52,349
Alice!

1091
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:57,085
I'm sorry I'm so late.

1092
01:20:58,085 --> 01:20:59,895
Let's go.

1093
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:08,196
Hey. Hey!

1094
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:10,402
Who's gonna pay for her drinks?

1095
01:21:12,402 --> 01:21:13,704
It's a curious thing,

1096
01:21:13,904 --> 01:21:15,344
but the thought of
breaking your nose

1097
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:18,145
is almost as satisfying
as actually doing it.

1098
01:21:29,087 --> 01:21:30,859
You came for me?

1099
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:34,896
Of course I did.

1100
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:38,211
Thank you.

1101
01:21:50,579 --> 01:21:52,925
You came for me.

1102
01:22:33,029 --> 01:22:35,532
<i>Give that necklace
back to me! It's mine.</i>

1103
01:22:35,732 --> 01:22:38,235
<i>It's mine! Give it back to me!</i>

1104
01:22:38,435 --> 01:22:39,472
<i>Mama!</i>

1105
01:22:41,472 --> 01:22:42,472
No! Mama!

1106
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:50,586
I know he died.

1107
01:22:52,586 --> 01:22:54,218
It's something you have to face.

1108
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:05,502
We was in love,
then a car killed him.

1109
01:23:05,702 --> 01:23:07,707
What else you want to know?

1110
01:23:10,707 --> 01:23:12,918
I don't remember
that much about it really.

1111
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:17,720
Well, maybe she does.

1112
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,856
That's her?

1113
01:23:24,056 --> 01:23:26,729
Does that name
mean anything to you?

1114
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:36,109
But I want to see her.

1115
01:23:41,109 --> 01:23:43,145
Is that something
you can help me do?

1116
01:23:43,345 --> 01:23:44,247
Yeah.

1117
01:23:45,247 --> 01:23:46,247
How?

1118
01:23:51,055 --> 01:23:52,692
Oh, shit.

1119
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:56,465
You don't have no idea, do you?

1120
01:23:59,465 --> 01:24:00,715
You're not alone.

1121
01:24:00,915 --> 01:24:02,166
Well, no shit!

1122
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,086
You lied to me, Doc.

1123
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:22,057
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah. You did.

1124
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:25,529
You ain't tell me that I
didn't have to be here by law.

1125
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:27,331
Well, I withheld
some information.

1126
01:24:27,531 --> 01:24:28,331
Yeah, well...

1127
01:24:31,269 --> 01:24:32,279
That's okay.

1128
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:44,393
If we're gonna keep workin' on this thing,
there's somethin' I'm gonna need.

1129
01:24:52,393 --> 01:24:54,529
Dr. Oz,
is that all?

1130
01:24:54,729 --> 01:24:56,199
Yes. Thank you.

1131
01:24:58,199 --> 01:24:59,569
What's this?

1132
01:25:21,394 --> 01:25:24,264
Where'd you get that from, Doc?

1133
01:25:24,464 --> 01:25:25,517
You steal that shit?

1134
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:29,104
Can you put those away?

1135
01:25:29,304 --> 01:25:30,372
Oh.

1136
01:25:30,572 --> 01:25:31,640
Sorry.

1137
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,176
You should try this though.

1138
01:25:35,376 --> 01:25:36,814
Really good!

1139
01:25:43,854 --> 01:25:47,158
I want you to
concentrate on the light.

1140
01:25:47,358 --> 01:25:48,727
Focus solely on the light.

1141
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,167
There's nothing but the light.

1142
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:57,337
And you're no longer here.

1143
01:25:58,337 --> 01:25:59,908
It's no longer now.

1144
01:26:01,908 --> 01:26:03,677
We're going back
to your youth...

1145
01:26:04,677 --> 01:26:06,582
Going back to Georgia.

1146
01:26:08,582 --> 01:26:10,217
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1147
01:26:10,417 --> 01:26:12,553
<i>This is my brother!</i>

1148
01:26:12,753 --> 01:26:14,890
<i>Get out of my house,
you filthy degenerate!</i>

1149
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:16,225
Get out!

1150
01:26:17,225 --> 01:26:19,201
We had to leave.

1151
01:26:24,201 --> 01:26:27,439
Because of what
happened with Pete?

1152
01:26:27,639 --> 01:26:32,247
He was gonna take me to a
place where nothing mattered.

1153
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:36,699
Not money...

1154
01:26:36,899 --> 01:26:38,351
Not family...

1155
01:26:39,351 --> 01:26:40,523
Not the skin color.

1156
01:26:42,523 --> 01:26:43,523
He loved you?

1157
01:26:50,731 --> 01:26:52,434
You came for me.

1158
01:26:54,804 --> 01:26:56,823
He loved me so much.

1159
01:27:12,925 --> 01:27:14,539
But he died?

1160
01:27:25,539 --> 01:27:27,578
Miss?
Miss, can you hear me?

1161
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,180
<i>His hand,</i>

1162
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,282
<i>I want to touch it,</i>

1163
01:27:33,482 --> 01:27:35,185
but I can't touch it.

1164
01:27:35,385 --> 01:27:37,421
What happened
after the accident?

1165
01:27:37,621 --> 01:27:39,657
After he died, what happened?

1166
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:46,330
Mama.

1167
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:47,865
Your mother? Edna?

1168
01:27:48,065 --> 01:27:48,865
Mama.

1169
01:27:58,645 --> 01:28:01,884
Oh, it hurts, Mama. It hurts!

1170
01:28:07,456 --> 01:28:08,559
Frankie?

1171
01:28:10,559 --> 01:28:12,528
She lied to me.

1172
01:28:12,728 --> 01:28:15,064
She made me a promise
and she broke it.

1173
01:28:15,264 --> 01:28:16,467
What kind of promise?

1174
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:19,337
Why the only promise
that really matters!

1175
01:28:19,537 --> 01:28:20,590
Alice, what promise?

1176
01:28:24,877 --> 01:28:27,445
What's happening, Frankie?
Where are you?

1177
01:28:27,645 --> 01:28:29,354
Can you tell me where you are?

1178
01:28:35,354 --> 01:28:37,425
"With skin and flesh
you clothed me,

1179
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:39,760
"with bones and sinew,
you knit me together.

1180
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,096
"Your hands have
formed and furnished me.

1181
01:28:42,296 --> 01:28:44,265
"Will you then
turn and destroy me?"

1182
01:28:44,465 --> 01:28:46,435
Who wants to destroy you, Alice?

1183
01:28:55,813 --> 01:28:57,714
Mama!

1184
01:28:57,914 --> 01:29:00,318
Is it coming, Mama?

1185
01:29:00,518 --> 01:29:02,021
What is it?
What's coming?

1186
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:05,557
Oh!

1187
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:07,663
Frankie, what's coming?

1188
01:29:10,663 --> 01:29:11,663
Mr. Oz?

1189
01:29:13,567 --> 01:29:15,553
Is that you, Mr. Oz?

1190
01:29:15,753 --> 01:29:17,739
Yes, Genius. It's me.

1191
01:29:18,739 --> 01:29:20,307
She's hurting.

1192
01:29:20,507 --> 01:29:22,645
I know.
I know she's hurting.

1193
01:29:23,645 --> 01:29:25,681
She's hurting!

1194
01:29:25,881 --> 01:29:28,752
- And she's crying!
- Yeah.

1195
01:29:28,952 --> 01:29:30,486
She's crying.

1196
01:29:30,686 --> 01:29:34,060
The pain will go away, Genius.
Frankie will be okay.

1197
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:37,764
It's not Frankie.

1198
01:29:38,764 --> 01:29:40,064
It's not Frankie!

1199
01:29:40,264 --> 01:29:41,365
Then who is it?

1200
01:29:41,565 --> 01:29:44,170
- No, Frankie!
- Who is it, Frankie?

1201
01:29:52,645 --> 01:29:54,197
Mama, is it coming?

1202
01:29:54,397 --> 01:29:55,749
Yes, baby, it's coming.

1203
01:29:55,949 --> 01:29:58,160
Just breathe, Frankie.
Just keep breathing.

1204
01:29:59,087 --> 01:30:00,689
Push...

1205
01:30:01,689 --> 01:30:03,559
It hurts, Mama. It hurts.

1206
01:30:03,759 --> 01:30:04,759
I know. Push, baby.

1207
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,163
Push. Push.

1208
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:15,839
Mama... Is it coming, Mama?

1209
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:17,941
Mama! Please, make it stop!

1210
01:30:18,141 --> 01:30:19,931
All right, baby.
Just come on, now.

1211
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:21,814
Can you see it?

1212
01:30:22,814 --> 01:30:24,249
Tell me what it is!

1213
01:30:24,449 --> 01:30:25,885
Come on. Come on.

1214
01:30:26,085 --> 01:30:27,553
Me and Pete,

1215
01:30:27,753 --> 01:30:30,257
we got names picked out.

1216
01:30:30,457 --> 01:30:33,226
Emmett if it's a boy,
and if it's a girl...

1217
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:37,833
Frankie...

1218
01:30:38,033 --> 01:30:41,637
Okay, baby.
Okay. Thank God.

1219
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:44,742
- Mama, is it out?
- Yes, baby.

1220
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:48,985
Tell me what it is.
Is it a girl?

1221
01:31:20,716 --> 01:31:22,055
What? Mama, what's wrong?

1222
01:31:26,055 --> 01:31:27,761
Mama? What's wrong?

1223
01:31:30,761 --> 01:31:33,768
Mama, why isn't he crying?
Let me see my baby.

1224
01:31:36,768 --> 01:31:38,400
Wait, Mama!
Where are you going?

1225
01:31:40,206 --> 01:31:41,206
No, Mama!

1226
01:31:44,043 --> 01:31:45,313
Mama!

1227
01:31:46,313 --> 01:31:47,653
No!

1228
01:31:51,653 --> 01:31:52,688
Mama!

1229
01:31:53,688 --> 01:31:55,069
Mama!

1230
01:32:06,069 --> 01:32:07,939
<i>"With skin and flesh
you clothed me.</i>

1231
01:32:08,139 --> 01:32:09,940
<i>"With bones and sinew,
you knit me together.</i>

1232
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:12,343
<i>"Your hands have
formed and furnished me.</i>

1233
01:32:12,543 --> 01:32:14,648
<i>"Will you then
turn and destroy me?"</i>

1234
01:32:14,848 --> 01:32:16,953
<i>Who wants to destroy you?</i>

1235
01:32:20,953 --> 01:32:21,953
<i>Mr. Oz?</i>

1236
01:32:23,789 --> 01:32:25,627
<i>Is that you, Mr. Oz?</i>

1237
01:32:26,627 --> 01:32:28,596
<i>It's me.</i>

1238
01:32:28,796 --> 01:32:30,798
<i>She's hurting.</i>

1239
01:32:30,998 --> 01:32:32,455
<i>I know she's hurting.</i>

1240
01:32:32,655 --> 01:32:34,113
<i>And she's crying!</i>

1241
01:32:43,113 --> 01:32:44,080
Frankie...

1242
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,851
I saw a hand move.

1243
01:32:47,851 --> 01:32:50,053
My mama killed it.

1244
01:32:50,253 --> 01:32:52,926
Our memories are not
always trustworthy.

1245
01:32:54,926 --> 01:32:58,198
Maybe the child wouldn't
have survived anyway.

1246
01:32:58,398 --> 01:33:01,737
Perhaps your mother just tried
to protect you from that.

1247
01:33:03,737 --> 01:33:04,737
Protect me?

1248
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:09,345
Every dream I had
was in that baby.

1249
01:33:11,345 --> 01:33:14,926
It's the only thing
I had left of Pete.

1250
01:33:22,926 --> 01:33:25,061
<i>Me and Pete,</i>

1251
01:33:25,261 --> 01:33:26,730
<i>we got names.</i>

1252
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:30,801
<i>If it's a boy,
we gonna name it Emmett...</i>

1253
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:34,743
<i>And if it's a girl...</i>

1254
01:33:37,743 --> 01:33:38,743
Alice.

1255
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:49,368
We were going to call her Alice.

1256
01:33:58,368 --> 01:34:00,877
Do you think my mama killed her?

1257
01:34:06,877 --> 01:34:09,562
I think all of us have to face
something we've done,

1258
01:34:11,048 --> 01:34:12,886
mistakes we've made,

1259
01:34:13,886 --> 01:34:16,890
things we've allowed to happen.

1260
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:20,793
<i>The things that
would've happened anyway.</i>

1261
01:34:20,993 --> 01:34:24,765
<i>But I don't think it's
the blame that's important.</i>

1262
01:34:24,965 --> 01:34:27,936
<i>I think it's the facing of it.</i>

1263
01:34:28,136 --> 01:34:32,945
<i>If we don't, there's no chance
ever for us to become whole.</i>

1264
01:34:35,945 --> 01:34:38,315
<i>Are they gone?</i>

1265
01:34:38,515 --> 01:34:40,685
<i>No.</i>

1266
01:34:40,885 --> 01:34:45,389
<i>But so long as you continue to
experience simultaneous co-presence,</i>

1267
01:34:45,589 --> 01:34:48,226
<i>you have a chance of achieving
successful integration.</i>

1268
01:34:48,426 --> 01:34:49,269
<i>In English, Doc?</i>

1269
01:34:50,028 --> 01:34:52,466
<i>You'll have to
learn to live together.</i>

1270
01:34:53,466 --> 01:34:56,252
Wall Street, Tina baby.
Wall Street.

1271
01:34:56,452 --> 01:34:59,039
I will be
putting it on your mid-term.

1272
01:34:59,239 --> 01:35:02,011
<i>Like a fresh start.
Well, I can work with that.</i>

1273
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:06,213
<i>Is Alice going to let me be me?</i>

1274
01:35:06,413 --> 01:35:08,413
<i>That's between the two of you.</i>

1275
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:11,024
<i>You have to understand,
treatment is indefinite.</i>

1276
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:14,440
<i>And integration is
only the beginning.</i>

1277
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,634
<i>The ultimate goal is acceptance.</i>

1278
01:35:16,834 --> 01:35:18,828
<i>How long will that take?</i>

1279
01:35:19,028 --> 01:35:20,298
<i>Honestly?</i>

1280
01:35:22,567 --> 01:35:24,203
