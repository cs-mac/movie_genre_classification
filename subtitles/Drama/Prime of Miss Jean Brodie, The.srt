1
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:01,183
To Marcel and Jacqueline Pagnol

2
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,851
Papet!

3
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,537
It's me! Ugolin!

4
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,427
It's me.

5
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:39,929
It's you, Galinette!

6
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:41,806
- You're back.
- Yes.

7
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,808
Wait, I'm coming!

8
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:48,229
- Just throw me the key to my house!
- I'll be right down.

9
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,482
What a surprise!

10
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:59,115
- You're out of the army!
- At last!

11
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:01,659
- Come in and eat.
- I'm not hungry.

12
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:04,704
I was out drinking
with friends all night.

13
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,956
Come for supper
and tell me all about it.

14
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,250
Okay, I'll see you later!

15
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:42,945
No, that's enough.

16
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,116
She's asking if you want more.

17
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,415
Thanks.

18
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,760
When I die, you'll live here.

19
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,473
The Soubeyran farm will be yours.

20
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:15,770
Meanwhile, you should fix up
your place up there.

21
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,400
Later, you'll be able
to rent it to a farmer

22
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,693
or leave it to your kids.

23
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:26,280
- For that, I'd need a wife.
- So?

24
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:29,659
There are plenty of girls around here

25
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,453
who'd love to marry a Soubeyran.

26
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:39,460
There's Chabert's daughter.
I bet if you wanted to...

27
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,174
I have no mule,
since I'm using yours.

28
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,803
I have no hens or goats,
since they're too much trouble.

29
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:53,516
I don't wear socks, since they itch.
<i>So</i> why would I need a wife?

30
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,727
What about love?

31
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:01,858
When I'm in Aubagne, I drop in
on those girls. That clears my mind.

32
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:05,820
For 15 francs a month,
I can choose any girl.

33
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,157
That's all I need.

34
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:13,744
You don't want to end up
a bachelor like me.

35
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,165
Before I die I want to see
a child of yours.

36
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,878
Why didn't you ever get married?

37
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,342
Before I think of marriage,
I'd better think of work.

38
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:33,181
Do you have any plans?

39
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,016
Maybe.

40
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,893
I have an idea for you.

41
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,979
I thought it all out.

42
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,024
I figured out everything,
including the costs.

43
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:47,570
- What is your idea?
- To restore the Soubeyran orchard,

44
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,823
the whole Solitaire plateau,

45
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,034
to the way it was
in my father's time:

46
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,704
200 fig trees, 200 plum trees,

47
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,915
200 almond trees.

48
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,375
A thousand trees,

49
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,921
planted in rows, 30 feet apart.

50
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:07,882
It'll be like a cathedral,

51
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:12,887
and every farmer will make
the sign of the cross.

52
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:18,935
Listen, Papet, we already have
too many plums, peaches, apricots.

53
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:22,063
We end up feeding them to the pigs.

54
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,315
I have another idea.

55
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,236
You're my only relative, Galinette.

56
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,073
You can tell me if you need my help.

57
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,536
What is your idea?

58
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,210
It's a secret.

59
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:25,334
- Well!
- Is that you, Papet?

60
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,296
You can't keep living like this!

61
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:32,008
You're holed up like a caveman!

62
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,176
This house is a pig sty!

63
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:39,015
And it stinks like a dung heap!

64
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,851
What's going on?

65
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,352
Tell me!

66
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:47,773
Don't get excited.
I'll show you something.

67
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,335
This is your big secret?

68
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,799
That's how you spend your time?

69
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,640
What'll you give me for them?

70
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,434
Real beauties.

71
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:24,977
They're lmperials.

72
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,437
Good stems.

73
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:27,980
How much?

74
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:31,442
Well, if this was February,

75
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:36,030
I'd have offered you 50 cents.

76
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,326
But the season's almost over.

77
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,872
Still, they're worth 20 cents.

78
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,250
- All right?
- Yes, all right.

79
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,561
You were right, Galinette.
You'll be growing flowers.

80
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,606
Why was it such a secret?

81
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:14,068
I wanted to try it out first,
to see if the soil is right.

82
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,612
Once they bloomed,
I knew you'd be impressed.

83
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:21,450
The flowers didn't impress me.
The florist did.

84
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,873
- What'll it cost?
- 15,000.

85
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,668
- You've got it.
- You're too generous!

86
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,587
Not really. It's not for you.

87
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:37,258
It's for all Soubeyrans,
buried ones and future ones.

88
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,637
If its nose was where its tail is,
it would die!

89
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,097
Like us!

90
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,733
- Something's bothering me.
- What?

91
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,610
- The water.
- What water?

92
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,530
A carnation plant drinks like a man.

93
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:03,492
For my 50 plants,
I shredded my hands hauling water.

94
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,829
Install a cistern with a pump.

95
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,499
It'll be empty in four days
if we water 500 plants.

96
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,627
That is a problem.

97
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,801
We should dig a big reservoir

98
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:23,804
that would collect
all the rain water.

99
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,598
It may not rain one year!

100
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,937
No. We must find a field
near a natural water source.

101
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,357
I wonder...

102
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:39,737
What if we buy Bouffigue's field
and his spring

103
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,113
up at Romarins?

104
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:46,410
Does that spring still have water?
My father said it dried up.

105
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:50,498
It's more than half blocked up.

106
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,418
When I was young
it was a lovely stream.

107
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:59,632
Old Camoins grew cartloads
of vegetables there.

108
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,677
I bet we could unblock it
with a pickaxe.

109
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,514
You think he'd sell his farm?

110
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:11,393
Not the house.
But maybe the field and the spring.

111
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,856
He never uses them.
Maybe if we offer him money...

112
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:33,123
Marius?

113
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,877
- How are you?
- None of your damn business.

114
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:40,172
Why are you nasty? Are you mad at me?

115
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:45,135
Neither mad nor glad.
I've got no use for you.

116
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:50,516
Maybe you feel that way, but I don't,
since I'm here to see you.

117
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,894
If you climbed all this way,
you want something.

118
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:59,066
Right. But I also
want to give you something.

119
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,322
I don't need anything.
Not even talk. It gets on my nerves.

120
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,075
Just listen to me, Marius.

121
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,579
If you sell me your property,
not the house,

122
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:15,332
just the field and the hill...
Just name your price.

123
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,587
What nerve!
You think I'd sell my property?

124
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,424
Look. Thousand-franc bills.

125
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:28,220
Go to hell!
Goddamn you Soubeyran pigs!

126
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,599
Don't yell like that or you'll choke.

127
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:35,853
And don't insult the Soubeyrans
or you'll regret it!

128
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,313
He's only kidding.

129
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,899
Why is that half-wit
getting involved?

130
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:45,321
I'll get down and show you
what I think of the Soubeyrans!

131
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:49,116
Lousy bastards! Pigs! Thieves!

132
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:50,534
Come down here!

133
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,661
Lousy bastard! Come down!

134
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,675
He'd better not croak!

135
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,218
Why not?

136
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,055
Someone could die
by falling off a tree.

137
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,696
So much for my carnations.

138
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:32,159
Too bad. It was a perfect spot.

139
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:36,288
If he doesn't wake up,
his heirs will sell the farm.

140
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,582
We could buy it cheap.

141
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,671
- Let's finish him off.
- No. Maybe someone saw us.

142
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,972
You see, Galinette,

143
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,516
never lose faith in Providence.

144
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,662
Why don't you shave him
in his bed?

145
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,166
I don't shave anyone
who is horizontal. Not even a corpse.

146
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,380
What... Where are those two going?

147
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,719
It's over here. See?

148
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,389
The spring was by the fig tree.
Don't turn around!

149
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,686
Old man Camoins had dug a ditch

150
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:45,024
that led down to the end
of that field there.

151
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:49,570
That way the water just ran
downhill by itself. Understand?

152
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,865
Look.

153
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,285
See the soggy ground
around my foot?

154
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:02,458
The water's blocked, but it's there.
It wouldn't be very hard.

155
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:08,756
To think he threw away
this gold mine.

156
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,014
Wait! Wait!

157
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,936
Once, before he went nuts,

158
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:26,148
he said, "My gun is my only friend.
I want it buried with me."

159
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,817
A man's last wishes are sacred.

160
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,000
Did you check if it's loaded?

161
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,338
I never thought of it.
You can't tell with a hammerless.

162
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,841
I bet it's loaded with buckshot.

163
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:56,970
He always kept it loaded
on account of the wild boars.

164
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,473
It could be dangerous.

165
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:03,519
It has a hair trigger.
A sudden wind could set it off.

166
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,022
- Maybe he set the safety?
- Not him.

167
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:26,208
- So, you're the heir.
- No. We were only distant cousins.

168
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,253
But you will get something.

169
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,548
No. It all goes
to his sister Florette.

170
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,677
- Is she still alive?
- Why not? She's younger than you.

171
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,680
Her husband died, but she's alive.

172
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,348
Who's this Florette?

173
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:44,476
Florette de Bérengére,
old Camoins' daughter.

174
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,936
The pretty one.

175
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:49,314
Your uncle knew her well.
Right, Cesar?

176
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,191
Where is she?

177
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,406
In Crespin. She married Lionel,
who was the blacksmith there.

178
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,783
Were you at her wedding?

179
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:03,745
No, I was far away
in an African military hospital.

180
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,747
I returned a year later.

181
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:09,710
I'll write to tell her
of her brother's death.

182
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,588
If she's alive,
she'll claim the inheritance.

183
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,798
She's the heiress.

184
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,633
Not much to inherit.

185
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:21,430
I don't agree.
The house is still in good shape.

186
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,474
Plus fifty olive trees
from before the war.

187
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,019
They're sick! They're dying out!

188
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,105
They just need a tickle
with the pickaxe.

189
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,816
Sure. Then they'll die laughing.

190
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,444
It never rains on that land.

191
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,363
You hear the storms,
you see the storms,

192
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:42,201
but before the clouds get there,
they split up

193
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,286
and it pours on the other side.

194
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,455
The valley side
only gets a few drops.

195
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,665
Maybe so.

196
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:53,795
You may not know,
but Bouffigue's land has a spring.

197
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:57,716
- It had a tiny spring.
- No, it was a beauty!

198
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:01,261
When I was a kid
my dad showed it to me.

199
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,764
It seemed like a river to me.

200
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:07,351
Either you were tiny,
or it had just rained,

201
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,647
because when I saw it 30 years ago,
it was as thin as my finger.

202
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:15,067
Could a spring like that disappear?

203
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,653
I know all about springs.

204
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,990
They're like pretty girls.
Neglect them, and they're gone.

205
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:26,495
Last year I saw a fig tree there.
That proves there's water.

206
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,456
- There was water.
- But there are new shoots!

207
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,460
You know about mixing drinks,
but you know nothing about springs.

208
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,504
I say this one is dry!

209
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:39,841
I say the olive trees are dead
and the soil is rotten!

210
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,304
And I say I wouldn't take that land
if you gave it to me!

211
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,024
I haven't written for years.

212
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,485
To whom are you writing?

213
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:02,197
- To Grafignette.
- Who's that?

214
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,287
You don't know her.
She left before you were born.

215
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:15,669
When the boys tried to kiss her,
she'd scratch their faces

216
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,881
with her pointed fingernails.

217
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,679
That's how she ended up an old maid.

218
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:32,144
Later she left to work
for the priest at Crespin.

219
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,440
She was Florette's best friend.

220
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,695
She'll be able to tell me about her.

221
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:48,368
I made an important decision.
I'll go see Florette in Crespin.

222
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:53,165
No, you won't.
If she knows you want her land,

223
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,751
she'll triple the price.

224
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,800
And if she knows
it's for us, she'll refuse.

225
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:08,013
- Why?
- That's the way she is.

226
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,556
What can we do?

227
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:11,767
Nothing.

228
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,605
Florette won't come back.

229
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:22,069
As a young woman, she loved money.
She's probably worse now.

230
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:28,408
So she'll sell,
but no local farmer will buy.

231
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:31,745
They own too much land already.

232
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,040
- A stranger might buy it.
- What the hell for?

233
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,793
To grow vegetables
or flowers, like me!

234
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,712
- Without water?
- There's the spring.

235
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:44,549
- What if there was no spring?
- But there is one!

236
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,596
You'll never learn.

237
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,266
Here's my plan.

238
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:58,188
It's already half stopped up.
An accident could shut it completely.

239
00:23:58,397 --> 00:23:59,648
What accident?

240
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:03,610
Suppose you walk by
with a load of cement.

241
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,946
You trip, you fall and... Bang!

242
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,824
Your cement plugs up the opening.

243
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,734
Here it is!

244
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,826
Good God! It's icy!

245
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,206
- God, it's cold.
- Hurry up, you idiot!

246
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,252
Here's the hole! Give me the plug!

247
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,505
No! The little one!

248
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:09,009
- The hammer.
- There's a root stuck here.

249
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:22,981
That's enough.
I'll have to unplug it later.

250
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:40,499
- I heard something.
- Where?

251
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,000
In the house.

252
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,379
That's not Bouffigue's ghost.
It's only rats.

253
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,220
"Dear Cesar.

254
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,890
"You always amaze me.

255
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:01,269
"After some 30 Christmases,
you write asking me about Florette,

256
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:06,733
"and your letter arrived
the day she died.

257
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,237
"I had just been laying her out."

258
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,825
"That's why I didn't answer sooner.

259
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:23,124
"I don't think she left much money.
Her husband died six years ago,

260
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,919
"and she lived on what he left.

261
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:31,049
"In any case, her son will inherit.

262
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,929
"His name is Jean Cadoret
and he must be about 35.

263
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:39,683
"He's a tax collector,
but I don't know where.

264
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:43,311
"The notary will surely locate him.

265
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:48,775
"Tax collectors are never
hard to find. He's married,"

266
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,612
"but unfortunately, by God's will,"

267
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,699
"he's a hunchback."

268
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,786
What if some villager
tells him about the spring?

269
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,332
That's unlikely.

270
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:09,629
The villagers here don't mix
into other people's business.

271
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,217
And the way you wrecked that house

272
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:18,430
would make any farmer
sit down and cry.

273
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:19,639
You're right!

274
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,975
He'll sell it.

275
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,691
A pen makes less blisters
than a pickaxe.

276
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:36,323
A farmer may grow a hump, but
a hunchback rarely becomes a farmer.

277
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:54,174
Who would have thought that Florette
would give birth to a hunchback?

278
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,619
Well, what do you think?

279
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,830
Look at these giant thistles,

280
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:10,458
those olive trees,
that wild rosemary.

281
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:14,045
My God, it's beautiful.

282
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,047
What did I tell you?

283
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,925
It's ancient Provence,
Zola's Paradise!

284
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,386
It's even lovelier than Paradise!

285
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,856
Try sliding it down.

286
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:04,531
Hello, folks!

287
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:08,076
- Hello!
- Would you like some help?

288
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:12,247
And how! We wondered how
to unload this one piece.

289
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,958
- You're very kind.
- Let's give it a try.

290
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,877
Thank you. Are you from Aubagne?

291
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,421
I'm from Bastides, but I live nearby.

292
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:25,009
- You passed my house on the way up.
- So, we're neighbors.

293
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:28,930
- Almost. I'm Ugolin Soubeyran.
- Delighted.

294
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,694
We'll need four men for this!

295
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,237
How did you lift it?

296
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:47,740
We loaded the empty crate,
then put the tools in.

297
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,410
And now we'll do it
the other way around.

298
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:08,219
I have enough tools here
for a nice little workshop.

299
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:38,666
Your wife sings beautifully.
It sounds even better than in church.

300
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,794
She has charmed many listeners.
She sang operas.

301
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:45,548
- In public?
- Yes, in concert halls.

302
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:49,302
That was years ago.
Today my voice is half gone.

303
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,387
It must have been fantastic!

304
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:54,432
Glorious! She triumphed as Manon.

305
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,936
That's why we call
our daughter Manon.

306
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,148
It's a great spot.

307
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:05,818
A tough climb, but it's worth it.

308
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,487
It's heaven on earth.

309
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,198
Is that why you rented this old farm?

310
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,909
- I didn't rent it.
- Did you buy it?

311
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:16,371
I didn't buy it either,
but it's my home.

312
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,336
Are you Jean de Florette?

313
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:27,256
My name is Jean,
and my mother was Florette.

314
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,550
But my name is Jean Cadoret.

315
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,471
If you'd been born here,
we'd call you Jean de Florette.

316
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:37,850
What a lovely title for a song,
or even a light opera!

317
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:39,519
You knew my mother?

318
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:44,732
No, but I knew her brother Bouffigue.
We were good friends.

319
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:52,407
I'll drink to Mother Nature,
to these fragrant hills,

320
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,535
to the cicadas, the breeze,

321
00:33:55,743 --> 00:34:00,665
to the age-old rocks.
I drink to the blue sky.

322
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,335
To your health.

323
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,758
Damn! They always do that to me!

324
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,677
<i>I'll</i> be back <i>tomorrow.</i>

325
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,931
Damn beasts!

326
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:24,814
I guess you folks are here
for a little holiday.

327
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,067
A holiday that will last until I die.

328
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:32,822
I'll live in the shade
of these pines, in peace and bliss,

329
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,283
for as long as God grants me life.

330
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:40,413
That sounds nice,
but how will you get water?

331
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,874
We have a cistern here.

332
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:47,837
It's small. Without rain,
you'll be out of water.

333
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:49,922
I also inherited a spring.

334
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:55,470
- A spring? Where?
- It's marked on a surveyor's map.

335
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,639
I'll show you. Maybe you can help me.

336
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,732
This little circle is a well,
or a spring.

337
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,609
Where's Romarins?

338
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:16,032
Here. The spring is about a mile
away, at the end of that valley.

339
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,617
That's ours, too.

340
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:21,829
I know the place!
It's beyond that hill.

341
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,540
It's a steep climb up to the spring.

342
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:27,710
The water's good, but the stream
is as wide as my thumb.

343
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:31,964
- I hope it's not far.
- At least an hour's walk.

344
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,843
We'd only need to go once a week.

345
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,929
It'll be our Sunday walk!

346
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:42,809
A Piedmontese lumberjack
and his wife live in the grotto.

347
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:46,312
The wife is sort of a witch.
She knows everything.

348
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,941
They're nice, they're clean.

349
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,026
But if it bothers you, they'll leave.

350
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:55,655
God forbid! If they're happy there
I won't chase them away.

351
00:35:56,405 --> 00:36:00,493
We'll go there soon.
This water problem is serious.

352
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:03,496
There's no rush.
Right now my well is full

353
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:07,500
so you can come by
for a bucket or two a day.

354
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,003
A generous offer
that I gratefully accept!

355
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:15,842
You're wondering why
I decided to settle here.

356
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,760
Yes, I'm wondering.

357
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,682
It's because I've decided

358
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,852
that my happiness lies
in returning to nature.

359
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:32,275
I'm here to cultivate the authentic!

360
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,527
The "othentic"?

361
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:38,531
Yes. I want to eat vegetables
from my garden,

362
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:43,035
collect oil from my olive trees
and eggs from my hens,

363
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,204
and drink wine from my vineyard.

364
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:49,041
That'll take time.
The olive trees have grown wild.

365
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,711
They'll need
three years of cultivating.

366
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:54,797
A vineyard, too,
will need three years.

367
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,842
But vegetables
can't grow without water.

368
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,844
We'll see!

369
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:03,890
Thanks to the inheritance
my thrifty mother left me,

370
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:07,393
we have enough to live on
for three years.

371
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,563
Three years from now...

372
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:13,608
Meanwhile, we have big plans!

373
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:22,700
Thanks again.
I must start work at once.

374
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:26,120
I notice the roof
leaks in quite a few spots.

375
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,664
Lots of luck!

376
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,167
We have energy to spare.

377
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:36,589
What type of man is he?

378
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,425
He's a city hunchback type.

379
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,096
- A city type?
- And how!

380
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,767
Watch out. He may be a city chump,

381
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:52,146
but hunchbacks
are often smarter than us.

382
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,150
What will he plant?

383
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,778
"Othentics"!
He'll plant "othentics" everywhere!

384
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,405
What's an "othentic"?

385
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:04,450
Probably a plant that grows in books.

386
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:06,994
"We must be modern," he said.

387
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:11,958
- I bet he mentioned routine.
- Right.

388
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,252
What is that?

389
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,545
It's a city word.

390
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:19,507
It means
that what our fathers taught us

391
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:24,720
is a lot of nonsense,
and that we should be modern.

392
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:32,270
It's pure bullshit.

393
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:38,484
He spoke of three years.
That's a disaster.

394
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,489
Don't always expect the worst.

395
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:49,495
Still, Anglade or Casimir,
who are distant cousins of his,

396
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:52,873
might tell him about the spring.

397
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,167
That would be serious.

398
00:38:55,793 --> 00:39:00,464
No. His mother warned him
to avoid folks from Bastides.

399
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,800
He'll buy his bread in Ruissatel,

400
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:04,885
and nobody must know
he's from Crespin.

401
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,388
But we will tell everyone.

402
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:12,351
We'll say a man from Crespin
bought the farm,

403
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,896
but we won't mention Florette's name.

404
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:21,027
Meanwhile, act friendly,
help him out, lend him my mule.

405
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:25,364
And play up to his wife.

406
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:29,243
A bunch of almonds,
two thrushes, a basket of figs,

407
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:34,874
<i>so</i> that when he leaves, he'll sell
the farm to you, no one else.

408
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:41,547
I told him he could have a bucket
of my well water every day.

409
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,717
But not for that reason.

410
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,470
Why else?

411
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:51,557
Plugging up the spring was no crime.
It was for my carnations.

412
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:55,144
But if they drink the cistern water,
they'll all three die.

413
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:58,272
It would always be on my conscience.

414
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:00,816
You're just like your poor mother.

415
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,611
But you did right.

416
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:08,324
Even so, I'll try to discourage him.
I'll say the soil's rotten,

417
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:11,452
the grasshoppers will eat his crop,
it never rains at Romarins!

418
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,870
Stop it!

419
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:18,459
You'll say that "othentics"
are great, that it rains often,

420
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:22,004
and he should start
his big projects right away.

421
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:28,928
Remember, it's much easier to push
something downhill than uphill.

422
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,099
So, push him in the direction
where he'll fall.

423
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:03,045
Good morning, neighbor.

424
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:05,923
As you see, I'm taking you up
on your generous offer.

425
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:08,259
Fine. Just help yourself.

426
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,345
I've been admiring
the landscape here.

427
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:13,889
I know nothing about landscapes.

428
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:16,183
It's beautiful.

429
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:19,854
It's big, you can see
what the weather will be.

430
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:21,397
That's true.

431
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:26,152
Come on, I'll show you.

432
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:32,032
Do this, or the bucket floats
and comes up empty.

433
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,618
Like that it'll sink.
See? It fills up!

434
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,338
How is your roof?

435
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:49,884
I'm short a few tiles.
I forgot to order them.

436
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:53,929
Unfortunately they'll be new.
That'll spoil the total effect.

437
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:57,558
- Nobody will notice on the roof.
- Still, it's such a pity.

438
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:02,229
Help yourself.
I have some planting to do.

439
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:03,814
A thousand thanks!

440
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:45,105
More furniture?

441
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:49,068
This load's <i>so</i> heavy,
I don't know if I'll make it!

442
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:52,571
A thousand pounds
of pipes and wire fence.

443
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,407
- What kind of pipes?
- Cement pipes.

444
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,701
- Big ones?
- And how!

445
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,704
- How much?
- About 100 feet.

446
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:03,249
- What for?
- Usually it's for water.

447
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:04,708
There's no water!

448
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:09,088
Maybe he'll pipe rainwater
down to his cistern.

449
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:09,838
He said that?

450
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:12,466
He said nothing.
There's also a pump.

451
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:13,675
What will he pump?

452
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:17,054
I don't know,
and I don't give a damn!

453
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:21,475
What'll he do with that fence?

454
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,564
Ready, Papa!

455
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,960
- Hello!
- Hello!

456
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:50,462
See these tiles?

457
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,216
- What are they for?
- For you!

458
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:56,885
I've had them for years!

459
00:43:57,094 --> 00:44:00,097
I thought,
"These will make him happy."

460
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:05,477
Many thanks.
A second favor that I won't forget.

461
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:09,815
I thought about your water problem.

462
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:13,861
The cistern's good for some watering,

463
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,614
but it's small and will dry up fast.

464
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,367
When it rains,
the road is full of water.

465
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:24,496
If you had pipes, large cements ones,

466
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:29,335
you could set up a pipeline
to keep your cistern filled.

467
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:30,878
What a good idea.

468
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:36,008
I just happen to have
some pipes on hand.

469
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:41,639
What did you intend them for?
And the wire?

470
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,392
That's a big secret.

471
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,394
A new fence?

472
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:50,564
Yes, but a special kind.

473
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:55,152
- It'll go two feet underground.
- To keep the rabbits out?

474
00:44:55,361 --> 00:44:59,365
You're close! To keep
the rabbits, yes. But not out.

475
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:02,201
I don't get it.

476
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:08,290
First I'll plant some leeks,
tomatoes, potatoes, chervil.

477
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:10,668
That's an hour's work every day.

478
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:13,045
- A kitchen garden?
- Precisely.

479
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:21,095
Next I'll plant some high-yield crop

480
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:24,973
vital for large-scale
rabbit breeding.

481
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:28,394
Large-scale? You mean big rabbits?

482
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:33,148
What we mean is hundreds of rabbits
a month, if not thousands.

483
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:38,404
No, Aimée,
we'll stay within reasonable limits.

484
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:40,739
Bring me my manual.

485
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:45,786
You've raised rabbits, haven't you?

486
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:48,831
I've got six, and my uncle has 30.

487
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,958
In spite of that,

488
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:54,962
you probably don't realize
how prolific these rodents are.

489
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,047
Here, read this.

490
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,510
I can read,
but I don't understand numbers.

491
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,265
Well, I do. It means that
with one pair of rabbits,

492
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:09,184
a modern breeder can obtain
within three years

493
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:11,603
a monthly yield of 500 rabbits.

494
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,150
But this expert warns
that raising over 5,000 head

495
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,318
becomes a public health hazard.

496
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:21,029
With 1,000 males and 5,000 females,

497
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:25,492
a breeder would be overrun with
30,000 rabbits the first month

498
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:29,830
200,000 by the sixth month
and two million by the tenth month!

499
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:35,335
A province or even a whole country
could be wiped out by famine!

500
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:38,630
- Really?
- Tell him about Australia!

501
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:42,468
That unfortunate continent,
14 times bigger than France,

502
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:46,054
almost perished from
an immigrant's pair of rabbits.

503
00:46:46,263 --> 00:46:49,516
Those rodents stripped
entire fields and prairies bare!

504
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:53,812
They had to build
a 1,200-mile electrified fence

505
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:56,982
and they had to slaughter
millions of them.

506
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:01,153
Are you planning
to raise that type here?

507
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,697
Certainly not.

508
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:08,368
I think the Australian climate
caused the breed's destructiveness.

509
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:12,414
Thank God!
So, you plan on 500 a month?

510
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:14,124
No!

511
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,084
I'm all for moderation.

512
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:19,671
I'll be satisfied
with a fourth of that.

513
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,675
I'm counting on 150 a month
within two years.

514
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:25,928
No more than that.

515
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:28,013
That makes more sense.

516
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:32,935
But just cleaning out the cages
is a big job.

517
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,689
- That's no problem!
- How exactly?

518
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:44,988
I want to see my rabbits run
and hop about!

519
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:49,076
I'll raise them
the modern way, outdoors.

520
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,744
What about the foxes?

521
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:55,374
You forget the fence,
six feet high, galvanized iron!

522
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:58,585
A six-foot fence
won't stop a fox. Never!

523
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:00,671
But galvanized iron might.

524
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:06,009
That's why I plan to use
underground burrows

525
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:09,346
with cement pipe openings.

526
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:14,351
The opening will let a rabbit enter,
but not a fox.

527
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,562
Good idea!

528
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,566
What will your rabbits eat?

529
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,739
- Here's my answer.
- You'll feed them matches?

530
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:39,418
Are those watermelon seeds?

531
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:44,840
- Are they "othentics"?
- Authentic? Of course they are.

532
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:49,177
These are authentic Cucurbita
melanosperma seeds from Asia.

533
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:54,224
The plant grows as quickly
as a snake darts out of its hole.

534
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,978
In the tropics, after the rains,

535
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:02,274
these creeping vines
can grow 30 inches a day!

536
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,653
Of course,
we're not in the tropics here.

537
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:09,865
- Thank God.
- And there's no real rainy season.

538
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:15,454
According to weather statistics
of the past 50 years, we should have

539
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:20,792
six days of rain in April,
five in May, four in June,

540
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:25,339
two in July, three days in August
and six days in September.

541
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:28,425
- That's just an average.
- It sounds about right.

542
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:31,428
Since rainfall is often sporadic,

543
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:35,682
we ought not to expect
this plant's maximum growth.

544
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:40,103
I estimate a reasonable growth
of about six inches a month.

545
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:43,732
Good! You'd have a problem
if they grew any faster.

546
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:47,361
You'd be picking up your squash
by the edge of the village.

547
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,488
Good point.

548
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:53,575
I figure each plant will yield
about 130 pounds of squash.

549
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:57,537
Not bad,
but you only have four seeds.

550
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:01,166
They're hard to get.
Today I have four.

551
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:07,172
But in six months I'll be eager
to stop their proliferation.

552
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:12,594
If your rabbits and squash
get out of control, what then?

553
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:16,974
We'll be rich! We must succeed,
or we're doomed to return

554
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:19,142
to the hell of city life!

555
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,795
- Well?
- Good news and bad.

556
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:50,882
He wants to raise rabbits outdoors,
inside a fence.

557
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:55,053
Rabbits? With a manual?

558
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:58,849
Yes, a book full of numbers.
It says you start with two rabbits

559
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:01,101
and get 1,000 in six months.

560
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:05,981
If they keep breeding, forget it!
That's how they ate up Australia.

561
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:10,110
This isn't Australia.

562
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:14,573
It's easy to make rabbits
multiply on paper.

563
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:20,495
He wants to limit himself
to 150 rabbits per month.

564
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,915
Only 150!

565
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:25,417
Is that all?

566
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:29,755
A toast to the losers!

567
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:32,883
Is that guy renting the farm?

568
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,635
No. He told me he bought it.

569
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:38,221
- He's a farmer?
- No, he's a hunchback.

570
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:43,977
Where does he buy his bread?

571
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:46,146
He buys everything in Ruissatel.

572
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,607
He thinks my bread is poison?

573
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:53,820
No. He avoids the village.
He's from Crespin.

574
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:55,405
From Crespin?

575
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:57,866
That's nothing to brag about!

576
00:51:58,075 --> 00:52:01,036
Nonsense!
Crespin folks aren't all bad!

577
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:02,370
<i>Most are.</i>

578
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:05,916
- What did he do?
- He was a tax collector.

579
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,876
Maybe he'll raise our taxes!

580
00:52:09,086 --> 00:52:10,337
Is he staying long?

581
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:13,757
I don't know. In any case,
he's fixing up his house.

582
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:16,259
- By himself?
- Yeah, with gloves on.

583
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:19,262
Some farmer!

584
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:23,141
A hunchback from Crespin
hiding on the hill, sounds fishy.

585
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:25,977
Leave him alone
and he won't bother us.

586
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:29,981
- Maybe he's a spy!
- What'll he spy on, your chickpeas?

587
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:43,703
I tell you,
the Good Lord sent us a sure loser.

588
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:45,372
Within six months he'll be gone.

589
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,582
He claims he must succeed
in three years.

590
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,709
Easier said than done.

591
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:51,837
But it proves he's got money.

592
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:55,841
Inherited money
burns a hole in your pocket.

593
00:52:56,049 --> 00:53:00,345
In six months he'll be broke
and we'll buy him out cheaply.

594
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:04,266
Meanwhile, let's see what he does
with his Chinese squash

595
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:06,351
and his giant rabbits!

596
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:13,066
Mmm.
Smells like she roasted some squab!

597
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:23,261
He'd better not find the spring.

598
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:30,185
We better keep an eye on him.

599
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:41,488
- Hello, neighbor!
- Hi, Monsieur Jean! Ma'am!

600
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:44,449
How's it going?

601
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,455
What is that contraption?

602
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:53,667
With your pickaxe,

603
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:57,128
you'll knock yourself out
for three months,

604
00:54:57,337 --> 00:55:01,341
while my plough will help us
finish the job in three days.

605
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:07,889
Aimée.

606
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:12,602
The heavens have answered our prayer!

607
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:43,008
It's from his field.

608
00:55:58,273 --> 00:56:03,236
The best soil in the region.
It's worth its weight in gold!

609
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:07,240
Such rich soil! It's killing me!

610
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:12,996
He's a good man.

611
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,292
I don't like him.

612
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,877
Because he's ugly?

613
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:22,088
Manon is afraid of him.

614
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:26,509
Manon, I'm surprised that
you don't like that nice man.

615
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,304
He's ugly. He looks like a toad.

616
00:56:29,763 --> 00:56:32,057
It's your thoughts that are ugly.

617
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:35,060
Ugly exteriors often hide
the purest souls.

618
00:56:40,774 --> 00:56:42,025
Look!

619
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:13,431
Come here, Manon.

620
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:19,104
I'll give you an important job.

621
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:23,233
You'll water these plants
carefully once a day.

622
00:57:55,807 --> 00:57:58,184
Galinette, he's a real joke.

623
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,896
He planted tomatoes
on the north side.

624
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:06,568
Even if they bear fruit,
it won't ever ripen.

625
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:09,779
He pushed his chickpeas
down too deep with a stick.

626
00:58:09,988 --> 00:58:12,574
They won't even yield
a salad-bowlful.

627
00:58:12,782 --> 00:58:16,578
He planted the onions
right under the olive tree!

628
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:22,834
And he didn't plant
the potatoes deep enough.

629
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:26,004
He doesn't sow seeds, he throws them!

630
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:29,716
They'll grow in tufts,
like hair on a mangy dog!

631
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:40,351
If that loony thinks
he can feed a family on that...

632
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,485
When I look at him, I have to laugh,

633
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,738
but it also breaks my heart.

634
00:58:53,031 --> 00:58:55,992
I feel like showing him
how to do it right.

635
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:58,244
Let him do it his way.

636
00:58:58,453 --> 00:59:01,289
It's not the best way,
but it's better for us.

637
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:12,008
Are you going on a picnic?

638
00:59:12,217 --> 00:59:15,011
We're getting drinking water
from the spring.

639
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:18,556
Our cistern is empty
and we mustn't impose on you.

640
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:21,601
Mine's been getting empty, too.

641
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,895
I've a feeling it'll rain tonight.

642
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:26,105
Why? You have rheumatism?

643
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:27,941
No, thank goodness!

644
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:32,111
But in May we only had
three days of rain instead of six.

645
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:37,283
It hasn't rained in June,
<i>so</i> we're owed five days of rain!

646
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:42,372
The heavens have 48 hours
to settle their debt.

647
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:47,919
- What's the shortest way?
- You'd better go the easiest way.

648
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,466
Follow the valley down,
but before you get to the village,

649
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:57,345
turn right and follow
the road to the grotto.

650
00:59:57,554 --> 00:59:59,764
Thank you. See you tonight!

651
01:00:01,933 --> 01:00:04,519
Good-bye, little one.
Good-bye, Madame.

652
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:41,264
It's beautiful!

653
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,356
We're the new owners.

654
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:55,778
But we don't want you to move out.

655
01:00:56,863 --> 01:01:00,450
We just came to fetch water.

656
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:09,667
Don't worry.
They came for <i>some</i> water.

657
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:11,753
They won't throw us out.

658
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:35,902
God bless you!

659
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:33,251
If that spring were near us,
we'd have no problem.

660
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,509
Let's put our faith
in the statistics and in Providence.

661
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:25,720
Hello, neighbor!

662
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:29,348
I'm going to Aubagne.
Can I bring you anything?

663
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:33,811
No, thanks!
Are you buying more seeds?

664
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,482
Even better!
I'm going to get my breeders!

665
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:40,526
Come see them tonight.

666
01:03:40,735 --> 01:03:43,404
Sure! I'd love
to see your first rabbits!

667
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:46,491
I'll bring along snails for Madame.

668
01:03:46,699 --> 01:03:48,367
See you tonight!

669
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:08,012
I chose young females
who've had no litters.

670
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:13,351
That's vital
for creating a new breed.

671
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:16,354
And now the male.

672
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:21,567
Manon, close the door!

673
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:24,695
He's terribly strong.
He might get away.

674
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:27,240
Not from me, he won't.

675
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:31,202
Holy mother! What's that?

676
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:34,580
He's a cross between
a giant rabbit and a ram.

677
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,711
I never saw anything like that!

678
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,882
It's got fur like a dog
and ears like a donkey!

679
01:04:46,092 --> 01:04:48,511
- Was it expensive?
- Very expensive!

680
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:51,389
That's a strange one!

681
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:54,433
He's a breeder.
Not young, but virile.

682
01:04:56,811 --> 01:04:58,604
He looks fierce.

683
01:04:58,813 --> 01:05:01,399
I bet he could eat a steak!

684
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,198
He sure got taken in!

685
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:13,494
What breed did he call it?

686
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:16,414
The Romarins breed.

687
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:33,347
Go, make us some nice
baby rabbits, old man!

688
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:45,568
You're going to start
the Romarins breed.

689
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:09,091
There isn't
much inheritance money left.

690
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:13,137
But I'm sure we'll pull through.

691
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:16,807
Our bills are paid,
and the worst is over.

692
01:06:25,775 --> 01:06:30,279
I want you to manage
the 1,123 francs that's left.

693
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,367
It should last us for a year.

694
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:38,412
In three months, I hope
to start selling my rabbits.

695
01:06:40,373 --> 01:06:43,167
If necessary,
we could sell my necklace.

696
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:47,838
- I was told it was worth 10,000.
- Sell your necklace? Never.

697
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:50,967
I'd sooner go barefoot!

698
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,028
Come quickly!

699
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:15,700
What is it?

700
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,538
Cesar.

701
01:07:59,035 --> 01:08:00,619
Let's measure it.

702
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,961
There's Ugolin's neighbor.

703
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:11,255
He thinks he's <i>some</i> big shit!

704
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,662
You should have aimed for his hump.

705
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,498
That's not funny.

706
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:23,888
Go on! You're too small!

707
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:36,567
Here's a big one!

708
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:45,201
What a beauty! A real Romarin!

709
01:11:06,889 --> 01:11:08,140
Shall we take it?

710
01:11:08,349 --> 01:11:09,349
How much?

711
01:12:03,112 --> 01:12:04,989
It won't last.

712
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,244
It's enough for my vineyard,
but not for his vegetables.

713
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,335
What do I think?

714
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:21,964
I think it's a disaster.

715
01:12:27,928 --> 01:12:29,179
Water!

716
01:12:54,246 --> 01:12:59,877
"Rain on Ascension Day
washes your crops away."

717
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:16,143
Stop worrying-

718
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:22,441
Remember, a wet spring always
brings a scorching summer.

719
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:27,613
In July, his green garden
will be yellow like ripe wheat.

720
01:13:29,114 --> 01:13:32,534
His corn husks will crackle
like patent leather shoes.

721
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:37,956
"Showers in June only bring ruin."

722
01:13:45,798 --> 01:13:47,966
I'm off to sell my vegetables!

723
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:51,470
This is my gratitude
for all your advice.

724
01:13:51,678 --> 01:13:53,889
That rain was a godsend.

725
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:57,851
- You've no potatoes yet?
- Not for another three weeks.

726
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,604
Really? Look at mine!

727
01:14:02,523 --> 01:14:04,441
How do you do it?

728
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:28,966
Amandine!

729
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:41,228
I keep forgetting she's deaf.

730
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:53,866
That's enough! Where's my dinner?

731
01:14:58,454 --> 01:14:59,872
I'm hungry-

732
01:15:01,373 --> 01:15:05,252
What's worse is that now
he gives me advice!

733
01:15:17,014 --> 01:15:18,974
It's all beautiful!

734
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:23,145
But I'm worried.
Summer hasn't started yet.

735
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:28,984
It's July 20th. In two more weeks
we'll get those August storms.

736
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:31,904
Losing all this would be a shame.

737
01:15:32,112 --> 01:15:33,822
My cistern is overflowing.

738
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:38,494
It holds 12 cubic meters,
and I need three every other day.

739
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:41,371
I can hold out another week.

740
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,374
But it may not rain in a week.

741
01:15:46,251 --> 01:15:51,423
"One seed yields an ear
with 400 to 450 kernels."

742
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:56,011
"In theory, the yield
is 400 times the planted seed."

743
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,346
See, Aimée.

744
01:15:57,554 --> 01:16:01,266
Even with a more reasonable
estimate, say, 300,

745
01:16:01,475 --> 01:16:05,729
I planted enough to yield
three tons of corn. That should do.

746
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:07,773
Thank you, sweetheart.

747
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:10,400
We'll also have 20 tons of squash.

748
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:13,111
Even half would be plenty.

749
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,240
The manual suggests
eight tons of feed a year.

750
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:29,253
We only have 720 francs left.

751
01:16:30,629 --> 01:16:34,800
- The money from selling the rabbits?
- That's included.

752
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:37,844
Now, more than ever,
we need God's help.

753
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:55,319
Papa!

754
01:16:56,321 --> 01:16:58,198
There's no more water!

755
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:06,498
There's no more water!

756
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:16,216
I expected this.

757
01:17:17,509 --> 01:17:20,637
I thought we had
a few days' water left.

758
01:17:20,846 --> 01:17:24,224
If it doesn't rain tonight,
we'll figure out something.

759
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:32,274
Luckily we have the spring.

760
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:35,611
Four trips a day
will kill your donkey.

761
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:40,115
We can stock 850 gallons in a week.

762
01:17:40,324 --> 01:17:44,620
- But we need rain within 10 days.
- 10 days, this time of year?

763
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:46,705
Well, you never know.

764
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:49,374
If the heavens let me down,

765
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:52,085
could you rent me your mule?

766
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:54,338
- Sure!
- Thank you!

767
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:56,882
Come on! A little bit more!

768
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:35,355
Galinette, if this beautiful
weather keeps up,

769
01:19:35,564 --> 01:19:38,358
his corn will be wiped out,

770
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,193
along with the rest.

771
01:20:46,218 --> 01:20:47,677
What's wrong?

772
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:06,404
You gave me a scare.

773
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:08,448
It was only a dream.

774
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,598
It's the hunchback!

775
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:36,852
I'm out! I'm not here!

776
01:21:47,863 --> 01:21:50,031
Is Mr. Ugolin here?

777
01:21:51,449 --> 01:21:53,493
Isn't he home?

778
01:21:53,702 --> 01:21:59,082
Ask him if he'll rent me his mule
starting tomorrow.

779
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:01,209
It's urgent!

780
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:04,671
His mule. Tomorrow! Thank you!

781
01:23:21,081 --> 01:23:23,041
My chickpeas are rotting.

782
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:27,379
My apricots dried up.
They're the size of small peas.

783
01:23:27,587 --> 01:23:31,591
My grapes won't make two casks
of wine. What a year!

784
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:37,013
The weather does as it pleases.

785
01:23:39,349 --> 01:23:41,935
It's bad for us, but worse for him.

786
01:23:42,852 --> 01:23:45,063
He needs 250 gallons a day.

787
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:50,694
He can't haul all that with
a donkey and a woman and a hump.

788
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:54,239
Another week of sunshine
and he's finished.

789
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:58,910
He wants to rent my mule.
It'll be hard to refuse.

790
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:02,580
Idiot! Your mule would save him!

791
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:05,166
It can carry 100 gallons a day!

792
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:10,588
You told me to be friendly,

793
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:15,218
so I drank his white wine
and called him Monsieur Jean,

794
01:24:15,427 --> 01:24:17,303
and he's become my friend.

795
01:24:17,721 --> 01:24:20,807
Dummy! You want to grow carnations
or make friends?

796
01:24:21,016 --> 01:24:24,477
What a dope! You sound
just like your poor mother!

797
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:30,525
If you start to strangle a cat,
finish it off!

798
01:24:32,444 --> 01:24:35,947
Believe me, if he makes out
this year, he'll continue,

799
01:24:36,156 --> 01:24:38,033
and next year
he'll start all over again.

800
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:40,785
And he'll be miserable all his life.

801
01:24:41,536 --> 01:24:45,790
With the money I'll gladly pay him,
he can move back to the city.

802
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:51,254
By not lending him the mule,
we're doing him a favor.

803
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:55,550
You're back at last!

804
01:24:55,759 --> 01:24:58,887
Yes, for the grape harvest!
It's our toughest chore.

805
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:01,765
Is everything all right?

806
01:25:01,973 --> 01:25:04,559
No. I'm almost out of water.

807
01:25:04,768 --> 01:25:07,562
It's a bad year. Everyone is hurting.

808
01:25:07,771 --> 01:25:11,566
Even the grapes
are shriveled up like raisins.

809
01:25:12,984 --> 01:25:15,361
Could I use your mule?

810
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:17,989
My uncle's.

811
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:21,159
Not right now. It's harvest time.

812
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:22,744
In two, three days?

813
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:27,999
After my uncle's harvest, Casimir
and the blacksmith use the mule.

814
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,878
We do that every year.
It takes ten days.

815
01:25:32,087 --> 01:25:33,463
But, you know,

816
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:37,592
with this heat wave,
we may get a thunderstorm tonight.

817
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:41,054
Your word in God's ear.

818
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:55,985
Here comes the loony!

819
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:13,753
He'll kill himself.

820
01:26:13,962 --> 01:26:17,549
He can go back to tax collecting,
but his donkey can't!

821
01:26:17,757 --> 01:26:19,634
I pity the donkey.

822
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:07,390
Are mules expensive?

823
01:27:09,767 --> 01:27:13,855
I think I can find one in Aubagne
for about 500 francs.

824
01:27:15,273 --> 01:27:18,151
I'll sell it in the fall
for a profit.

825
01:27:19,277 --> 01:27:20,653
But for that,

826
01:27:22,363 --> 01:27:25,241
I'm asking you to make a sacrifice.

827
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:30,038
That is, a temporary separation

828
01:27:30,955 --> 01:27:33,541
from your necklace. If you agree.

829
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,627
- To sell?
- No.

830
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:40,590
No, just to pawn it.
There's no risk involved.

831
01:27:40,798 --> 01:27:44,844
They'll lend me 2,000 francs for it.
It's worth much more.

832
01:27:45,053 --> 01:27:48,640
The mule will thrive
on the mountain air,

833
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:51,601
and in two months I'll resell it.

834
01:27:51,809 --> 01:27:55,313
Then we'll get the necklace back.

835
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:58,483
That's all right, isn't it, Mama?

836
01:27:58,691 --> 01:28:00,109
Of course.

837
01:28:00,652 --> 01:28:03,947
Time for bed. Tomorrow is a big day.

838
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:17,794
Do you mind giving it up?

839
01:28:22,423 --> 01:28:23,967
I already have.

840
01:28:28,263 --> 01:28:31,557
- What?
- I've already pawned it.

841
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:39,023
- When?
- Last month.

842
01:28:41,609 --> 01:28:44,279
I had no more money.

843
01:28:45,196 --> 01:28:47,365
You bought many things,

844
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:50,743
books, tools, bran for the rabbits.

845
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:56,332
And we drink lots of wine.

846
01:29:00,503 --> 01:29:03,089
- How much did you get for it?
- 100 francs.

847
01:29:03,298 --> 01:29:04,716
100 francs?

848
01:29:04,924 --> 01:29:06,926
The emeralds were fakes.

849
01:29:58,144 --> 01:30:00,813
Please, God, make it rain.

850
01:30:04,317 --> 01:30:07,236
Please, God, make it rain.

851
01:30:54,492 --> 01:30:58,037
In 20 minutes
the cistern will be full!

852
01:30:58,246 --> 01:31:00,248
What a beautiful storm!

853
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:04,877
Manon! I felt the first drop!

854
01:31:06,087 --> 01:31:08,464
Me too, Papa!

855
01:31:08,673 --> 01:31:12,385
I want to feel this
blessed water on my face!

856
01:31:12,593 --> 01:31:14,887
Thank you, God!

857
01:31:25,857 --> 01:31:27,984
But it's raining over there!

858
01:31:34,615 --> 01:31:36,492
The rain is over there!

859
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:44,709
I'm a hunchback!
Have you forgotten that?

860
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:46,461
Do you think it's easy?

861
01:31:46,669 --> 01:31:47,669
Come.

862
01:31:47,795 --> 01:31:49,839
There's nobody up there!

863
01:31:50,381 --> 01:31:52,467
There's nobody up there!

864
01:31:59,432 --> 01:32:01,017
I'm a hunchback!

865
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:06,022
Do you think that's easy?

866
01:32:07,106 --> 01:32:09,025
There's nobody up there.

867
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,560
What is that?

868
01:33:31,983 --> 01:33:33,693
Aimée, come, look!

869
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:38,990
Look!

870
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:41,158
Dear God, what is it?

871
01:33:41,367 --> 01:33:45,746
Awindstorm! I'll run
to the spring for water!

872
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:56,048
I have no time!
Meet me at the spring!

873
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:08,978
Hurry!
It's a matter of life and death!

874
01:34:11,272 --> 01:34:13,149
Papa will get sick!

875
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:14,692
Hurry!

876
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,120
Now I know
why God gave me this hump.

877
01:34:37,048 --> 01:34:39,884
She says
she'll take the sun out of him.

878
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:43,929
She says if we don't
take the sun out, he'll die.

879
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:46,093
All that for some lousy squash.

880
01:36:46,302 --> 01:36:49,597
It's awful to see them work
like slaves in this heat.

881
01:36:51,056 --> 01:36:52,308
Twenty-six.

882
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:55,853
He just didn't plan it right.
Twenty-seven.

883
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:58,731
His squash will never make it.

884
01:36:58,939 --> 01:37:01,442
But he's got a spring at Romarins.

885
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:03,944
It seems to be plugged up.

886
01:37:04,153 --> 01:37:06,322
Maybe it didn't plug up by itself.

887
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:10,201
Maybe one should ask
the Soubeyrans. Maybe...

888
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:12,661
Never mind that.

889
01:37:13,245 --> 01:37:15,915
The Soubeyrans do as they please
and so do we!

890
01:37:16,248 --> 01:37:19,627
It doesn't pay to mind
other people's business!

891
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:21,879
The less talk, the better!

892
01:37:27,551 --> 01:37:29,053
It's time for our move!

893
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:32,431
His fields are a disaster area.

894
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:34,433
He doesn't need to die, though.

895
01:37:34,642 --> 01:37:37,937
Offer him six or seven thousand,
but haggle with him.

896
01:37:38,145 --> 01:37:39,939
Let me kiss you, Papet!

897
01:37:40,147 --> 01:37:43,067
Stop that! Now hurry over there.

898
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:47,196
Wait! Bring him
this bottle of new wine.

899
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:49,740
It'll do him good. Hurry!

900
01:37:54,954 --> 01:37:59,291
Your wine is delicious,
but I have to face the facts.

901
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,418
My ventures failed.

902
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:04,547
It's a disaster.

903
01:38:06,006 --> 01:38:08,259
I could blame it on fate

904
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:10,761
or the unusual weather pattern,

905
01:38:11,971 --> 01:38:15,307
but I'd rather blame
my own stupidity.

906
01:38:16,392 --> 01:38:18,310
My lack of common sense.

907
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:23,357
I thought I was clever,
but, in fact, I was blind.

908
01:38:24,108 --> 01:38:25,943
Blind to my only problem.

909
01:38:27,069 --> 01:38:28,279
Water.

910
01:38:28,487 --> 01:38:31,866
That's right.
Without water it won't work.

911
01:38:34,118 --> 01:38:35,619
That's in the past.

912
01:38:35,828 --> 01:38:38,122
Now, here's what I'm going to do.

913
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:43,544
When I've regained my strength,

914
01:38:44,628 --> 01:38:45,963
I'll dig a well.

915
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:49,216
- Where?
- I'll use a divining rod.

916
01:38:50,134 --> 01:38:51,719
Are you a dowser?

917
01:38:53,304 --> 01:38:54,680
Not exactly.

918
01:38:56,932 --> 01:39:01,937
But I have a special manual
that I'll study carefully.

919
01:39:04,607 --> 01:39:09,111
I'll learn to use the rod
and I'm sure I'll find water.

920
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,405
You know how to make a well?

921
01:39:12,156 --> 01:39:16,076
After all, a well is just
a hole in the ground.

922
01:39:17,328 --> 01:39:21,332
I'll make it 36 feet deep,
and even if I don't hit water,

923
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,292
my problem is solved.

924
01:39:24,335 --> 01:39:26,503
What good is a dry well?

925
01:39:26,712 --> 01:39:29,006
I'll use it as a cistern!

926
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:34,345
A well that size will hold
43 cubic meters of water!

927
01:39:34,553 --> 01:39:36,722
Spring rains will fill it up.

928
01:39:36,931 --> 01:39:41,435
In the summer months,
between this well and our cistern,

929
01:39:41,644 --> 01:39:43,854
we'll have 55 cubic meters.

930
01:39:44,063 --> 01:39:47,650
That gives us 36 days
of worry-free watering.

931
01:39:48,859 --> 01:39:50,945
We've had longer dry spells.

932
01:39:51,779 --> 01:39:55,157
Where does a drought last 36 days?

933
01:39:57,159 --> 01:39:59,411
The Sahara? Maybe!

934
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,872
Or maybe in the Gobi Desert!

935
01:40:02,081 --> 01:40:03,499
But not here!

936
01:40:05,626 --> 01:40:09,129
It's mathematically impossible!

937
01:40:12,466 --> 01:40:13,842
Let's drink!

938
01:40:25,479 --> 01:40:27,398
From what you tell me,

939
01:40:28,315 --> 01:40:30,693
the only good news is that now

940
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:32,987
he drinks red wine.

941
01:40:33,362 --> 01:40:35,030
And the divining rod?

942
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:37,741
That's a nuisance.

943
01:40:38,409 --> 01:40:40,703
Could his book teach him the secret?

944
01:40:41,412 --> 01:40:45,249
Hell, no. It's no secret.
It's a special touch.

945
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:49,712
- He might hire a real dowser.
- You know any?

946
01:40:50,087 --> 01:40:52,423
I knew one in Ombrées.

947
01:40:52,631 --> 01:40:56,885
If he came to Romarins,
he'd locate the spring in a flash!

948
01:40:57,553 --> 01:40:59,263
Is he still in Ombrées?

949
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:02,933
Sure, but luckily
he's in the graveyard.

950
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:06,770
And then, a good dowser is expensive.

951
01:41:07,771 --> 01:41:09,064
Did you talk money?

952
01:41:09,273 --> 01:41:13,110
Not yet. He was drunk.

953
01:41:14,236 --> 01:41:16,405
I think he's got no money left.

954
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:20,242
When it comes to money,
you can never be sure.

955
01:41:42,264 --> 01:41:44,600
Aimée! I think it moved!

956
01:42:11,919 --> 01:42:15,506
- How is it going?
- It's getting harder to dig.

957
01:42:16,757 --> 01:42:19,468
- Tough?
- It certainly is!

958
01:42:19,676 --> 01:42:22,805
I'm down to the white rock
I told you about!

959
01:42:23,013 --> 01:42:25,057
- The Quaternary?
- Exactly!

960
01:42:26,433 --> 01:42:29,937
If there's water under this rock,
I'll reach it in two weeks.

961
01:42:30,312 --> 01:42:33,607
But if it's under
the Quaternary layer,

962
01:42:33,816 --> 01:42:36,151
it'll take six months or more.

963
01:42:53,585 --> 01:42:56,922
Now I know
what a ditch-digger's thirst is.

964
01:42:57,131 --> 01:42:59,007
This hits the spot!

965
01:43:09,852 --> 01:43:12,729
Monsieur Jean,
I have to be frank with you.

966
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:17,359
You may think
this is none of my business,

967
01:43:17,568 --> 01:43:19,319
but the truth is
I feel sorry for you.

968
01:43:19,528 --> 01:43:22,823
All the work you've been doing
for almost two years...

969
01:43:23,031 --> 01:43:25,159
It's madness. It'll kill you.

970
01:43:25,742 --> 01:43:27,911
An interesting introduction.

971
01:43:28,996 --> 01:43:31,039
You won't finish your well.

972
01:43:32,124 --> 01:43:33,876
Even if you do, it's not enough.

973
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:37,171
You need a river
for all your corn and squash!

974
01:43:37,379 --> 01:43:40,424
This is no life for you,
and that's the truth.

975
01:43:43,594 --> 01:43:46,597
Go on. This is all very interesting.

976
01:43:48,223 --> 01:43:50,559
A man like you belongs in the city.

977
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:53,145
You're educated.
You could be a teacher,

978
01:43:53,353 --> 01:43:57,065
or even a mailman
with a nice neat outfit.

979
01:43:57,274 --> 01:43:59,109
That's what you're meant for.

980
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:02,738
If you stay here,
you'll kill yourself.

981
01:44:04,281 --> 01:44:08,493
You're out of money. That's no crime.
But you're skimping.

982
01:44:08,702 --> 01:44:12,414
Eating rabbit and dandelion
leaves you too weak for this work.

983
01:44:13,415 --> 01:44:15,626
Then you drink too much wine.

984
01:44:18,545 --> 01:44:20,756
One day you'll just drop dead.

985
01:44:21,632 --> 01:44:25,761
How will your wife
and daughter manage then?

986
01:44:27,095 --> 01:44:29,848
They haven't been looking
too well lately.

987
01:44:30,307 --> 01:44:31,725
I've noticed.

988
01:44:46,531 --> 01:44:48,200
What's this farm worth?

989
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:50,786
- To rent or sell?
- To sell.

990
01:44:51,203 --> 01:44:53,038
- Papa!
- Just a minute.

991
01:44:54,122 --> 01:44:57,292
It's hard to say.
I hadn't thought about it.

992
01:44:57,709 --> 01:44:59,836
It's no summer residence,

993
01:45:00,045 --> 01:45:02,923
and without water,
it's no use to a farmer.

994
01:45:05,175 --> 01:45:08,178
The second cistern
will add to its value.

995
01:45:08,512 --> 01:45:10,097
Maybe. Maybe.

996
01:45:12,099 --> 01:45:13,642
Seven thousand.

997
01:45:14,601 --> 01:45:15,978
Is that all?

998
01:45:19,314 --> 01:45:21,316
Let's say eight thousand.

999
01:45:21,525 --> 01:45:23,652
You wouldn't sell
your mother's house!

1000
01:45:25,028 --> 01:45:27,197
The price is perfectly reasonable.

1001
01:45:27,406 --> 01:45:32,244
It means I can ask our notary
for a 4,000-franc mortgage!

1002
01:45:32,494 --> 01:45:33,870
Then you're not selling?

1003
01:45:34,037 --> 01:45:35,414
Never!

1004
01:45:35,622 --> 01:45:39,167
I'll never sell the house
where I hope to live forever,

1005
01:45:39,376 --> 01:45:41,044
once we're rich!

1006
01:45:41,253 --> 01:45:44,381
We can manage quite well
on 4,000 francs!

1007
01:45:45,007 --> 01:45:50,220
I'll buy a mule and some
mining tools and dynamite

1008
01:45:50,429 --> 01:45:52,347
to blast this damn rock!

1009
01:45:52,556 --> 01:45:55,684
In a year I'll pay off the mortgage
and we'll be set.

1010
01:46:00,147 --> 01:46:01,898
You know what a mortgage is?

1011
01:46:02,107 --> 01:46:06,194
It's when a notary lends money
to honest people who own property.

1012
01:46:06,570 --> 01:46:08,280
What honest people?

1013
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:11,450
He'll have to sign official papers.

1014
01:46:11,658 --> 01:46:15,954
And if he doesn't pay on time,
they take his farm.

1015
01:46:18,248 --> 01:46:20,500
All right, ten minutes.
Now leave us alone.

1016
01:46:32,554 --> 01:46:35,057
There's something good
and something bad.

1017
01:46:35,891 --> 01:46:38,643
The bad part is,
if he gets 4,000 francs,

1018
01:46:39,394 --> 01:46:41,938
his venture may succeed
next summer.

1019
01:46:42,147 --> 01:46:45,817
On the other hand,
since he's a born loser,

1020
01:46:46,777 --> 01:46:48,737
many things can go wrong.

1021
01:46:50,572 --> 01:46:55,035
And dynamite and drinking don't mix.

1022
01:46:56,745 --> 01:47:00,832
In any case,
whoever owns the mortgage wins.

1023
01:47:01,917 --> 01:47:04,544
So, I'll finance his mortgage myself.

1024
01:47:05,379 --> 01:47:08,173
If he succeeds, he'll pay me interest

1025
01:47:09,341 --> 01:47:11,093
and repay the loan.

1026
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,387
And if he fails,

1027
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:16,181
we'll get the farm.

1028
01:47:17,557 --> 01:47:20,769
You're smart, Papet, real smart.

1029
01:47:21,686 --> 01:47:25,440
I'm smart because I have money.

1030
01:48:59,993 --> 01:49:01,411
It's all set!

1031
01:49:07,501 --> 01:49:09,127
You do the honors.

1032
01:49:24,726 --> 01:49:27,479
Go, get Mama! I want her
to see the water shoot up!

1033
01:49:27,687 --> 01:49:28,687
Go on!

1034
01:50:06,351 --> 01:50:07,351
Jean!

1035
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:30,792
What's wrong?

1036
01:50:32,794 --> 01:50:34,254
Did you have an accident?

1037
01:50:37,757 --> 01:50:42,637
I ran to see the water shoot up,

1038
01:50:42,846 --> 01:50:46,224
but some rocks were blown sky-high

1039
01:50:46,433 --> 01:50:48,518
and landed on my head.

1040
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:52,897
If you can talk, it's not too bad.

1041
01:51:01,865 --> 01:51:03,533
Over here, Doctor.

1042
01:51:05,535 --> 01:51:08,788
It was a small rock, Doctor.

1043
01:51:22,886 --> 01:51:26,556
When he tried to speak before,
he ground his teeth.

1044
01:51:34,022 --> 01:51:37,275
He didn't suffer before going
where we'll all go.

1045
01:51:39,235 --> 01:51:42,405
The rock must have fractured
a cervical vertebra.

1046
01:51:43,657 --> 01:51:46,743
Even if I'd come sooner,
it wouldn't have helped.

1047
01:52:16,773 --> 01:52:20,068
I just stopped the clock
at Monsieur Jean's house.

1048
01:52:23,697 --> 01:52:25,699
Is that why you're crying?

1049
01:52:31,121 --> 01:52:33,081
It's not me that's crying.

1050
01:52:34,624 --> 01:52:36,209
It's my eyes!

1051
01:53:20,003 --> 01:53:21,838
What'll they do now?

1052
01:53:22,046 --> 01:53:25,842
They must have relatives.
And they can sell the farm.

1053
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:29,387
And you might buy it out of kindness?

1054
01:53:29,596 --> 01:53:32,015
It depends. What is it worth?

1055
01:53:32,223 --> 01:53:36,311
Not much. In any case,
it wasn't worth a man's life.

1056
01:54:38,289 --> 01:54:41,292
8,000 francs is more than reasonable.

1057
01:54:41,501 --> 01:54:45,463
If there were a water source,
it would be worth double.

1058
01:54:45,672 --> 01:54:49,634
But there's only one cistern,
and the house is very old.

1059
01:54:50,552 --> 01:54:53,346
Once you pay off your mortgage

1060
01:54:53,555 --> 01:54:55,932
and we deduct interest and fees,

1061
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:59,310
you'll be left with 3,880 francs.

1062
01:55:00,562 --> 01:55:02,438
Sign here, please.

1063
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:05,775
And initial these.

1064
01:55:19,664 --> 01:55:23,585
I must tell you that the buyer
has been very generous.

1065
01:55:23,877 --> 01:55:26,045
You can continue to live here.

1066
01:55:26,963 --> 01:55:31,342
He's renting it to me.
I'll only farm the land.

1067
01:55:31,551 --> 01:55:34,470
This is your home.
I'll never come in without knocking.

1068
01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:37,807
For me, this will always be
Monsieur Jean's house.

1069
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:10,173
I've clowned around enough.
Anyway, they're leaving.

1070
01:56:10,381 --> 01:56:11,716
Let's go.

1071
01:56:54,384 --> 01:56:56,552
Hold on, I think I've got it!

1072
01:56:58,721 --> 01:57:01,599
There must be
plenty of water down there.

1073
01:57:13,611 --> 01:57:16,906
Carnations, Galinette!

1074
01:57:17,115 --> 01:57:19,117
15,000 francs a year!

1075
01:57:19,325 --> 01:57:22,036
It's liquid gold!

1076
01:57:35,258 --> 01:57:36,676
What was that?

1077
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:38,511
Nothing!

1078
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:42,098
Just a hare caught by a buzzard.

1079
01:58:11,461 --> 01:58:14,881
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1080
01:58:15,882 --> 01:58:18,760
I hereby name you King of Carnations!

1081
01:58:27,226 --> 01:58:33,232
End of Part One.
