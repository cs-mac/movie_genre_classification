Hey, Fuke.
- Hey there.

19
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,992
What brings you here?!

20
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,237
I came to see my aunt and uncle.
What's up?

21
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,718
Nothing much.
I'm just going downtown.

22
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,158
See ya...
- Yeah, bye...

23
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,593
Idriz!

24
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,633
Idriz!

25
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,230
Where are you?!
- I hear you. I'm coming.

26
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,951
This is as fast as I can!

27
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,674
Sure! If you hear me,
why don't you answer?

28
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,475
Who is it?

29
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,594
It's me, Fuke.

30
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,992
Who?
- It's me, uncle. Fuke!

31
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,909
Who's there?

32
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,480
What is it that you want?
- Idriz, who is it?

33
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,438
Uncle Idriz, it's Fuke.
Fuad, Zineta's son.

34
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,031
It's you, Fuke.

35
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,670
Hello, my child.
- Hello, uncle.

36
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,280
I thought I knew that voice.
Come in, please.

37
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,599
What's up?

38
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,200
Am I interrupting something?
- Of course not.

39
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,510
I was just arranging some old boxes.

40
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,680
I thought about you this morning,

41
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,240
I wondered how come you never
come by. - As if I sensed that!

42
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
I know, I took ages to come by
and look at that boiler.

43
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,040
Something always comes up.

44
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,474
I know, my son.
You always have things to do.

45
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,240
There's something wrong
with hot water.

46
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,674
It sort of works,
and then it doesn't.

47
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,434
It could be really bad,
deep inside the system.

48
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't worry, we'll sort it out
in no time.

49
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,673
We'll open it up, if necessary.

50
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,756
Right. Come on it.
I'm glad you came.

51
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,750
Sure.

52
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,960
I tried to get you on the phone
a few times.

53
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,758
I think there's something
wrong with the lines.

54
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,238
Really? We've been here
all the time.

55
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,718
Who are you talking to?

56
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,558
Fuke's here.

57
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,758
Really?

58
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,720
Look at him.
- Hello, auntie! - Hello.

59
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,800
Working too hard?

60
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,000
Nothing special.
Just airing the house.

61
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,920
Fuke's here to fix the boiler.
- That's nice.

62
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,592
We can have a chat, too.

63
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,360
I was just saying, I tried
to reach you a few times,

64
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,760
but I just couldn't get through.

65
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,955
As if it's busy all the time.

66
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,600
I probably unplugged the phone
when I was dusting it.

67
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,280
I'm sure that was it.

68
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,759
Please, come in.

69
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,920
Wait. Not those slippers.

70
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,514
Let me get you another pair

71
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,119
These are nice and soft.
Real leather.

72
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,553
Okay, thanks.
- Look at that!

73
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,993
And I searched for them
all over the place.

74
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,669
You don't need new slippers.

75
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,280
My dear, if I'd known
you were coming,

76
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,238
I would've cleaned up
the bathroom a bit.

77
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,709
Sure! It's already
tidy as a pharmacy.

78
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,640
You can speak all you want,
my dear uncle.

79
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,080
She is sort of careful,
but as soon as I leave

80
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,550
she's all over smoked meat
and cheese cream.

81
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,720
She knows she's got high blood
pressure, but she just can't help it,

82
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,240
she loves the heavy stuff!
I keep telling her:

83
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
'Mom, don't eat that,
you know it's bad for you.'

84
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,840
And she goes:'I won't, don't worry!'

85
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,800
As soon as I'm out the door,
she does it again.

86
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,920
What can you do about it,
up there?

87
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,036
I know, my child.

88
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
When your late father was alive,
he and I wondered

89
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,880
how your mother Zineta and Sabira
were so much alike,

90
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,791
as if they're sisters.

91
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,320
Like it or not,
they'll get their way!

92
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,200
Just look at her. Cleaning
the bathroom for you,

93
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,031
as if it could be any cleaner.

94
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,839
She's always been like that,
just like her mother.

95
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,200
But since this thing happened,

96
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,751
almost seven years now
since Emin, God rest his soul,

97
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,560
honest to God, it's twice as bad!

98
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,360
That's what she does all the time,

99
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,080
cleaning, washing, sweeping
and weeping!

100
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,675
She keeps cleaning and airing
rugs and carpets!

101
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,713
No words can describe
what she does!

102
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,637
I can imagine!

103
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,158
Just don't pay attention.

104
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,800
I know it's hard, but try not to.

105
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,440
I keep trying! But she always
frightens me with one of her...

106
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,760
The other day, every time
I laid eyes on her,

107
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,991
she was putting cream
on her hands.

108
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,597
I finally worked out that
she burnt her fingers

109
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,713
with toilet bleach, trying to make
the tub shiny white.

110
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,280
That could be nasty.
How bad was it?

111
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,396
It's okay, just the tips
of her fingers.

112
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,680
I keep telling her,
don't play with chemicals,

113
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,280
you'll burn down the house and
me in it, and she goes:

114
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,555
'People have always used
acid for cleaning.'

115
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,920
It's these bad times,
they keep giving us

116
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,831
really bad imported stuff.

117
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,790
It's all Chinese chemistry!

118
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,470
Chinese chemistry?
- Sure it is.

119
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,110
I don't know.

120
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,400
There, everything's ready.

121
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,073
Shall we have coffee now, or
you want to look at boiler first?

122
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,237
I want to look at that boiler first.

123
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,880
Who was that on the phone?
- It wasn't them.

124
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,720
I didn't think so,
that's not what I asked.

125
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,000
Zineta called, to check
if you arrived alright.

126
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,200
She says be careful and
don't pick up anything heavy,

127
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,668
you don't want to mess up
your back again.

128
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,916
She just has to find something
to worry about.

129
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,030
No, you won't!

130
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,515
Sabira!

131
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,755
Sabira-hanum!

132
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,953
Hello, Begzada-hanum.
- Hello, Sabira.

133
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,877
Why are you standing there?
- Cause your gate is locked.

134
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,356
And I'm in a bit of a hurry anyway.

135
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,720
Idriz must have been
doing something again.

136
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
Wait, I'll go get the key.

137
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,472
Don't, I'm not coming in.

138
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,789
I just came to give you
this piece of cornbread.

139
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,718
Real corn, bright as gold!

140
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,080
It's real cornflower.
Seval and Larisa went to Visoko

141
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,600
and her father went to the mill
to grind it. - Really?

142
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,239
This is your plate. That's why
I brought it!

143
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,437
I thought the pattern
looked familiar.

144
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,080
A visitor? Do tell who it is.

145
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,913
Fuke has come
to look at the boiler.

146
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,034
Great, you'll have hot water again.
- God willing, yes.

147
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,599
How's work?

148
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,080
Okay, most of the time.
The salary's not much,

149
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,799
but when you look at others,
this is just fine.

150
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,593
Just look at all those people
with no work at all.

151
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,714
You're right.

152
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,033
And you were so lucky in the war.

153
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,194
There was very little damage.
- Almost nothing.

154
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,879
And we were one of the first
to start the privatization.

155
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,554
Do Sheila and Aida
ever come to visit?

156
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,315
Watch out, don't let
the water burst out.

157
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,600
It won't.
It's not from the pipes.

158
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,115
It's just what's left
inside the boiler.

159
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,228
Whatever. Just make sure
it doesn't burst!

160
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,075
I'm careful with it.

161
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,160
Remember the mandolin your
late father brought for me

162
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,152
from that seminar in Opatija?

163
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,040
In Zivogosce, you mean?

164
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,112
No, in Opatija. Of course
it wasn't Zivogosce.

165
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,320
Right. He did go to Opatija,
just before the Olympics,

166
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,756
his company sent him.
- That's it.

167
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,475
I got it mixed up for a second.

168
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,475
I found the mandolin.

169
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,351
It's still there?
- Yes, it is.

170
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,791
You'd be surprised,
it still works just fine.

171
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,075
I remember those days,
you sure knew how to play it.

172
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,071
My playing days are long gone.
- Right.

173
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,000
So, what about Sheila and Aida?

174
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,356
What's up with them, where are they?
- They're here.

175
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,354
They went to Tuzla for the weekend,
to see Sheila's brother.

176
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,670
It's Aida's birthday tomorrow.

177
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,592
I forgot all about it.
- May 7th.

178
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,274
Coming on 10, my child.

179
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,075
Doesn't time fly?
- Unbelievable, isn't it?

180
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,757
I saw Aida last week

181
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,471
and I just thought,
hasn't she grown up.

182
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,000
Now that you say that she's
turning 10,

183
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,389
of course she's grown up.

184
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,154
Yes, a big girl.

185
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,360
They're not coming here for
her birthday. That's strange.

186
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,636
They can't. Work is so strict
these days!

187
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,995
I know, I heard someone
bought them.

188
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,194
And you can't mess with
these foreigners.

189
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,720
But it's no good when a woman
is too ambitious,

190
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,029
it's just not right,
and that's that!

191
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,638
When I saw Aida
I could hardly recognize her.

192
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,080
You should see her when
she comes to visit!

193
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,480
Heaven forbid to enter the house
with your shoes on.

194
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,840
She goes: 'Grandpa,
you can't wear same slippers

195
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,638
in the house and in the garden.'
- Really?

196
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,680
That child knows every
single thing in this house,

197
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,468
as if she was born here.
- She was born here.

198
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,873
Yes, but...

199
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,760
See, she knows
where everything is,

200
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,070
every little thing,
as if she lives here.

201
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,473
Uncle...

202
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,000
there's something
I just have to tell you.

203
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,634
Maybe it just seems to me,

204
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,191
but Aida has the same walk
as her late father.

205
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,954
She tiptoes.
It's just like seeing Emin.

206
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,356
You're right.

207
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,719
The image is there...

208
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,116
You say it warms up,
but there's no hot water.

209
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,079
Right!

210
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,360
There was warm water
until two days ago.

211
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,476
It was really nice and warm.

212
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,911
But even that's gone cold now.

213
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,948
I think it could be the heater!
- I think so too.

214
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,160
We'll see when I open it.
Is this 'Gorenje'?

215
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,674
Yes, Slovenian. From Velenje.

216
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,190
It's almost 17 years old!

217
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,480
I think I have a spare heater
in the garage,

218
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,960
but I'm not sure if it's 'Gorenje'.

219
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Are you done with the coffee?
- Ages ago.

220
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,236
You burnt up four cigarettes
in half an hour!

221
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,880
Here's some juice, my child.

222
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,800
I made it a bit sweeter,
'cause you're working.

223
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,518
Thanks.

224
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,678
You must be tired.

225
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,516
No, I'm fine.
- The juice will do you good.

226
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,560
I'll have to go home
and get the heater.

227
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,597
Idriz said right away
that it was the heater.

228
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,874
Are you done painting the walls?

229
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,229
Yes.

230
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,316
And?

231
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,993
Not bad.

232
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,553
She didn't get the color
right again?

233
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,560
The color was right but
the base was real lime,

234
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,199
a total mess for two days.

235
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,599
Zineta likes lime,
and that's that.

236
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,669
She may like it, but
nobody does that any more.

237
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,036
The painter told her himself.

238
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,434
He only agreed to do it as
a special favor to her.

239
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,156
Nothing beats your cakes.

240
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,960
Just enough syrup, not too much,
not too little.

241
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,920
It could have been
just a bit airier.

242
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,388
No, it couldn't!

243
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,554
It could have,
just a little.

244
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,200
I was just telling uncle,
I saw Aida the other day.

245
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,156
All grown up, isn't she?

246
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,120
For your information,
Aida is turning ten tomorrow!

247
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,918
He knows, I told him.

248
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,672
Please play that tape,
when she sings in the choir.

249
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,675
We can't watch that again.

250
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,798
Fuke should see it.
He's never seen it before.

251
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,276
You can't see her well.

252
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,872
There she is, in the middle,
second row.

253
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,872
Next to the blonde girl.

254
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,909
I can see her.
- There she is.

255
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,791
They sure sing well.

256
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,672
Just like one voice.

257
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,068
As if it's not a choir.
- She is grandma's life.

258
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,280
Strange that they didn't call
when they arrived.

259
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,999
They haven't called, that means
they've arrived.

260
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,240
Does she have a mobile?
Want me to call her?

261
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,708
No, don't bother.

262
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,428
There... the end.

263
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,436
Why aren't you eating your cake?
- I will.

264
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,672
I can't just now.

265
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,834
Are you having that
chest pain again?

266
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,560
I'm fine. Never mind that,

267
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,917
let me talk to the man in peace.
- As you wish.

268
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,120
And don't spill the residue,
I need it.

269
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,000
I saw you brought them
into the house again!

270
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,833
So what? They're harmless.
They're in a tin box.

271
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,837
It's cold at night,
they'll die anyway.

272
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,228
Who?

273
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,671
Earthworms, that's who!

274
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,920
Why did you need that
funny little guitar?

275
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,831
Dear God.

276
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,191
Give us the good news now.

277
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,520
What you mean?

278
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,671
I mean, what's up with...
you know...

279
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,036
They say it's not good to ask
about that...

280
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,794
Love, I mean.
- Oh, that...

281
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,790
You just had to ask,
didn't you?

282
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,680
Let me be. You and Zineta
find out everything.

283
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,000
I never get to hear about it.

284
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,991
I feel like an idiot.

285
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,679
And?

286
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,994
Well, Samra is back...

287
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,958
so... you know...

288
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,679
it is...

289
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,878
It is what, my child?

290
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,558
We are... sort of...
dating again.

291
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,200
That's what I want to hear!
- To be honest,

292
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,749
if there was anything,
you'd be the first to know!

293
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,720
Is it serious?
- Well, yes.

294
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,429
We sort of talked about it
the other day, you know,

295
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,035
getting married and stuff.

296
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,240
And all of a sudden she goes:

297
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,920
'I would really like
to live in Rovinj! '

298
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,071
Where?
- In Rovinj.

299
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,874
On the Slovenian coast!
- Rovinj what?

300
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,314
I don't know. They used to go
there for holidays,

301
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,074
so she sort of likes the area,
and the climate,

302
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,758
the sea and clean air
and stuff like that.

303
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,200
That's far. Almost all the way
to Italy! - I know.

304
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,034
I said so too. I sure don't
want to live up there!

305
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,788
And yet...

306
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,959
I was just thinking, I mean...

307
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,760
if that's the only way...

308
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,600
Please be careful!

309
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
You're smart, but do
keep an eye on everything!

310
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,600
She mentioned this Rovinj once,
she sure will again.

311
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,909
I know, auntie, I know...

312
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,711
Then Rijeka, then Pula,
then hop, hop, hop...

313
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,671
All the way up...

314
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,677
Idriz?
- Yes?

315
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,356
Let me get you your medicines.
- No, I'll get them.

316
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,557
Remember where you stopped.

317
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,316
Sabira?
- Yes?

318
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,597
Sabira!
- What?

319
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,195
Where are my pink pills?

320
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,752
In the white box, next to your
shaver. I put them there.

321
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,158
In the white box,
next to the shaver...

322
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,320
Why did you have to take them
out of the box?

323
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,520
It was made that way on purpose.

324
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,193
His heart's gone to Tuzla.

325
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,760
I see that uncle is really
bothered by something.

326
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,000
Bothered and buried alive.

327
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,560
Sheila knows
you want them to come.

328
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,640
What can she do?
She's got so much to do,

329
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,599
she wouldn't manage
even if she had twice the time.

330
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,360
She sets things up
so that she's left no time

331
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,480
to think about things.
- I know, but still...

332
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,393
And this one...
He's killing himself.

333
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,189
You know that Idriz won't let
anyone touch Emin's room.

334
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,160
And Aida keeps going there,
it's her blood,

335
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,631
she keeps finding stuff
and asking us questions.

336
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,948
She's a big girl. Of course
she wants to know.

337
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,120
She should know. It's better
that we tell her about it,

338
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,040
rather than asking other people.
Sheila sort of keeps to herself,

339
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,955
she doesn't want to say no to us,
but I know her heart's on fire,

340
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,440
I can see it,
no one needs to tell me.

341
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,070
Her eyes tell me everything.
I know her inside out.

342
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,038
She brought a child to this world
with our loss.

343
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,880
I wish we could
take everything apart

344
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,394
and just put it back again.

345
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,920
Take what apart?

346
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,600
Emin's room, to fix it.
For Aida,

347
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,149
so it can be her own room,
it's time.

348
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,153
I don't know.

349
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,351
It will soon be seven years
since Emin was killed.

350
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,433
On Thursday.
- Yes.

351
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,837
Seven years,
like seven minutes.

352
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,640
I went to his grave a while ago.
I'll go again on Thursday.

353
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,313
My son, my son...

354
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,473
Auntie, don't...
What can you do now?

355
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,349
I won't, honest, I won't...

356
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,637
If only I could

357
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,712
disappear,
just fly far, far away.

358
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,436
Dear God, it's all up to you!

359
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,473
God's will...

360
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,075
That's all we can say.

361
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,632
God's will...

362
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,510
God's will and the enemy's hand!

363
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,829
Yeah...

364
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,831
Did Zineta buy that gas stove?

365
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,960
I'll look for the heater right away

366
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,680
and I'll let you know if it matches.
If it doesn't,

367
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,200
I'll see where I could find
an original one.

368
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,800
Thanks, my child. Don't take
too much trouble.

369
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,713
No trouble, let's just fix it.

370
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,598
Take some cake to Zineta.
She'll enjoy it.

371
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,639
Thanks.
I was just telling uncle,

372
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,680
I'll let you know as soon as
I find the heater.

373
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,440
Thank you, my dear.
I hope it's not too much trouble.

374
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,680
You've got enough work as it is,
all the time.

375
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,440
Don't worry. We'll sort it out.
Bye now.

376
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,352
Good bye. Do come to visit.
- I'll see you out.

377
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,634
Let me take that.

378
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,309
Can you manage?
- Sure.

379
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,398
Go back inside.
- Never mind.

380
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,955
Drive carefully.
- I will, don't worry.

381
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,473
That doesn't seem to work.

382
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,199
Look at this! It works one minute,
the next it doesn't.

383
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,238
It sounds like a dead battery.

384
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,915
It sounds like there's no
electrical supply.

385
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,035
What can I do in this darkness?

386
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,677
Do you have a flashlight
in the house? - Yes.

387
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,351
Yes, but it doesn't work.

388
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,274
Wait, I'll go and ask Ekrem.

389
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,200
It's all because of
the wheat flower!

390
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,600
Where did you buy it?
At Djulaga's store?

391
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,993
That's strange. That must be
his new supply.

392
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,400
I didn't have the chance,

393
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,517
Idriz asked him while
I was in the kitchen!

394
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,750
Don't say,
summer holidays in Rovinj?

395
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,396
I told him. A smart man would know,
a hint would do.

396
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,514
What?
Of course he's smart enough.

397
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,269
He is smart enough.

398
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,390
Here.

399
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,872
Sorry for the trouble.
- No trouble at all.

400
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,358
These stairs are so steep.

401
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,358
What's up, Fuke?
- It just won't start.

402
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,909
Try it once.

403
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,073
It sounds like a dead battery.
- I think so too. - Me too.

404
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,597
And if we push it a bit?

405
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,080
It's easy to push downhill,

406
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,880
but what if we have to push it
uphill again?

407
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,476
I have charger cables, you know,
that electric thing you just plug in.

408
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,475
How long does it take to charge?
Roughly?

409
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,840
An hour and a half approximately.
An hour should do it.

410
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,196
Go on, plug it in and see
what happens.

411
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,759
Okay.

412
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,240
See how well they
make them now!

413
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,550
It's serious business now.
Aren't they cheap?

414
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,070
That's really cheap.

415
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,633
Around here you can't get them
for less than a hundred.

416
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,795
Any colors other than brown?

417
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,194
Not at the moment.
In a few days.

418
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,559
You've shown me all I need to see.
Light and good quality.

419
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,272
Aren't they soft as cotton?

420
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,040
I'll tell Sheila to stop by
as soon as she comes back.

421
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,917
I haven't seen her in a while.

422
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,239
Are there any leather slippers,
the ones from the last time?

423
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,117
I'll ask. I'm not sure though,
they are really in demand.

424
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,837
Put it over there.

425
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,877
Here! - Let me do it.

426
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,034
I saw Buba earlier.

427
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,633
Great car, congratulations.

428
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,597
That's what we could afford.
- Where does she go?

429
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,239
To school.

430
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,960
She is attending evening
classes for computer training.

431
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,235
Three times a week,
after work.

432
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,520
That's great. I wanted to
do it too.

433
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,960
So did I, but you just
can't find the time.

434
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,554
Work and then
the computer thing.

435
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,116
How about coffee?

436
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,920
We just finished a pot.

437
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,593
A juice will be fine.
- A vitamin drink.

438
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,229
Good evening.

439
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,913
What's up, my dear, honest friend?

440
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,716
All's well, no complaints!

441
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,314
Hello, Muhamed!
- Hi, Fuke. What's up?

442
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,592
We're charging the battery.
I couldn't start the car.

443
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,672
Don't say?
- Yeah, well.

444
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,874
Whose jump-cable is this?

445
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,319
It's mine, of course.

446
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,628
It's really good.

447
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,480
Decent people are in bed now,
and I have to teach kids

448
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,631
how to play table tennis.
Just look at the racket.

449
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,840
I thought I could give you
a quick beating

450
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,434
but this time you're saved
by a car battery!

451
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,033
11:8. Alright.

452
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,759
Acrobat the mighty flyer,
never mind, he trips the wire!

453
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,308
Brick, trick, kick,
Hamed's gone to the nick!

454
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,640
This doesn't count!

455
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,520
Go fetch the ball, Hame.
The ball!

456
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,954
Okay, champ!
- It's not okay, come on!

457
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,952
Acrobat the mighty flyer,
never mind, he trips the wire!

458
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,520
Idriz?
- Yes?

459
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,280
Where on earth have you been?

460
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,000
You went to see the man of
and you disappeared.

461
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,070
I've been with Fuke.
His car wouldn't start.

462
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,310
Is it okay now?

463
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,560
No. He went to Ekrem's
to charge the battery.

464
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,200
He's got one of those
charger things.

465
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,112
Dear God!
Is he coming back here?

466
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,799
I told him to ring us
when they come back.

467
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,994
Where are you going?
The news starts in a minute.

468
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,914
I've had enough, they just keep
spitting at one another.

469
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,874
You had a good team there.

470
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,678
You remember it?
- Of course I do!

471
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,109
Nobody in the world had
a kick like 'Krila'!

472
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,349
Remember when he whacked
the fat guy,

473
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,278
when the ambulance came?
- Down by the school.

474
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,920
Just think about that.
His mom was so worried,

475
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,117
she had to put an ice-bag
on her head.

476
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,357
His mum still says that
he could never go to college

477
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,873
because 'Krila' hit him so bad
that his concentration was

478
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,836
you know... all messed up.
- My foot!

479
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,440
'Krila' was in my class
in primary school.

480
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,480
Even then he could hardly get by.
He was always stealing stuff.

481
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,758
He was only good in crafts!
- You're right.

482
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,671
It's got a really powerful beam.

483
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,949
Dad!

484
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,200
Good evening, Almir!
- Good evening.

485
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,000
What's up?
- Nothing special.

486
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,195
Dad, can I play video games?

487
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,989
You've spent the entire morning
in front of the computer,

488
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,675
your head will just burst.
- Please.

489
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,879
Drop that, go home, straight to bed!

490
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,991
I'll ask mom.

491
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,429
Let me show you.
I've expanded the business.

492
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,040
I have two guys from Mostar,
refugees in Sweden for 6 years,

493
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,999
went to hairdressing school there,
and the customers really like them.

494
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,953
That means real business.
- You bet.

495
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,596
Sit down, try out this chair.

496
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,675
How come Sheila never comes
to see Idriz?

497
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,593
She does. She's just very busy.

498
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,551
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I don't want to interfere,

499
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,872
but everything and everyone's
as close as it can be.

500
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,189
Here you see everything.
Even stuff that shouldn't be seen.

501
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,269
What do you mean?

502
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,236
People see behind the gates,
even Idriz's gate.

503
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,039
Not that I would ever look.
It's the architecture.

504
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,959
So?

505
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,148
I saw Idriz yelling at Sheila.

506
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,154
The entire neighborhood saw it.

507
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,397
There, that's it.
Shit, I had to tell you.

508
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,438
When was that?

509
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,876
Maybe even 6 months ago.

510
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,871
Good that you told me.

511
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,157
Good that you came here.

512
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,150
Why did he yell?
- How would I know.

513
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,629
There was a situation,
I was just walking past,

514
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,071
saw the scene and
it just stuck with me.

515
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,674
It's just for your information,
so you know.

516
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,595
Did you hear that Samra's back?
- Samra who?

517
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,872
You know, the one and only.

518
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,511
Your Samra! - Yes.
- Hey, I had no idea.

519
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,872
Yes, that's recent.

520
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,880
She was a refugee in New York,
she got the passport

521
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,110
and now... she's back.

522
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,117
So, are you, you know...
sort of something...

523
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,193
Yes, sort of something...
again.

524
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,160
Well, congratulations, then.
I'm glad for you.

525
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,800
Never mind that.

526
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,951
People congratulated me once
before, and things went all wrong.

527
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,035
The war turned things all wrong.

528
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,072
It turned things upside down.

529
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,556
We'll see. Let things
come into place a bit.

530
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,792
Tell me honestly, whatever it is,

531
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,274
would you ever
go to live in Rovinj?

532
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,756
To Rovinj?
To live there?

533
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,837
Would you? Yes or no,
just tell me, no matter what!

534
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,030
I don't know. You got me there.

535
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,950
Fucking Rovinj. No idea.

536
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,079
That's it! That's
the issue of my problem.

537
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,640
Did you shake the tablecloth
properly? - Yes.

538
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,791
I don't want any crumbs
sticking to it.

539
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,636
I think it should go in the wash.

540
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,114
I called.

541
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,874
Who?
- Aida, in Tuzla.

542
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,360
Didn't I ask you not to call?

543
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,999
I didn't mean to,
my hand just flew.

544
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,633
What does Aida say?

545
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,040
She was out playing with kids,
I didn't talk to her,

546
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,032
she'll call tomorrow.
I spoke to Sheila.

547
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,031
Yes?

548
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,119
It's done, let's try it!
- I'm coming.

549
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,759
Did you check the fuel?
- What fuel?

550
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,957
Maybe he's out of fuel.

551
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,030
What fuel!? It's not that.

552
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,870
It's more of an
electrical problem!

553
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,675
Fuel!

554
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,709
Try now!

555
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,229
Don't push it any more.
See, it just won't work.

556
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,198
This time it sounded like
something else, not the battery.

557
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,836
Maybe it's the alternator?
- It's the battery.

558
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,640
Never mind, take the cable,

559
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,200
connect it to the battery
and leave it overnight.

560
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,077
I don't think you have
any other choice.

561
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,035
Let's push it, whatever happens.

562
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,314
That's fine, but how do we...

563
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,834
No problem.

564
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,434
If we're going to push it,

565
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,432
you just stand in the street
and watch the traffic.

566
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,640
Drive carefully, make sure
you control it. Go on.

567
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,796
Clutch, clutch, clutch!

568
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,473
Watch out!

569
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,753
Not a chance.

570
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,199
It's dead.

571
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,879
I told you.

572
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,116
Push, push, all together!

573
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,429
If you can't push, just step aside,
don't make a mess for nothing.

574
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,075
Go on, Tarzan!
- Get lost!

575
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,753
Come on, Ekrem!

576
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,793
Straight, Idriz, straight.

577
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,830
Come on... now... hop in...

578
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,034
Never mind the shoes,
take it straight to the bathroom!

579
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,077
Here I am again.
I just won't leave.

580
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,635
That's alright.

581
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,436
That car is really a nuisance.

582
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,913
It's just old.

583
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,269
It needs maintenance
all the time.

584
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,480
It'll be fine, my child.

585
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,755
This could have happened
on the road somewhere.

586
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,038
Great, you made me a pie.

587
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,036
The garlic smells great.

588
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,115
The oven's not that good.
I thought about stuffed peppers,

589
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,310
but I know how much you like
potato pie, so I took a chance.

590
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,759
Take it, it's calling you.

591
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,960
Okay then, I'll take a cab
and go home,

592
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,349
and come back early
in the morning to get the car.

593
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,631
The cab will be a rip-off.
Why don't you sleep here?

594
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,956
There's an empty room.

595
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,951
Tomorrow is Sunday,
you don't work.

596
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,429
I don't know, mum's on her own.

597
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,040
Nothing can happen to her.

598
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,235
I spoke to her a minute ago.

599
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,634
She must be worried.
- No, she isn't.

600
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,197
Did you tell her I couldn't
start the car?

601
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,433
I told her all and
she says you shouldn't drive

602
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,715
until the car's been fixed properly.
That's what she said.

603
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,313
What are you doing?
- Cleaning the fish tank.

604
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,315
At this hour?

605
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,600
What else? I work days,
and at night I wait.

606
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,793
Wait for what?
- Nothing.

607
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,392
I left you a piece of pizza,
if you're hungry.

608
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,432
They are doing overtime too?

609
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,153
Who?

610
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,959
The computers.

611
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,829
Is that supposed to be funny?

612
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,594
In good time!

613
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,520
Here it is, from Sweden.
Zejnil sent it to Idriz,

614
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,193
but it's too big for him,
it'll just fit you well.

615
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,999
Thanks.

616
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,710
This fabric is so soft.
- I told you.

617
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,949
I'll pack it for you tomorrow
before you go.

618
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,120
No. Why should I take it with me?
- Of course you will.

619
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,554
It'll just collect dust here.

620
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,070
How come you came up
with Sweden?

621
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,348
Did he go to sleep?

622
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,159
Yes. A minute ago.

623
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,079
I'll throw that computer away!

624
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,510
Sure you will!
What will I practice with?

625
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,078
What's up with Fuke?
- He's upset about the car,

626
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,439
he has to dish out the money
for a new battery!

627
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,640
Why doesn't Samra buy him one,

628
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,596
I'm sure she has enough
stashed on the side.

629
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,349
Great that she's back. I was so
surprised when he told me.

630
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,068
She's back
only to go away again.

631
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,838
What do you mean?

632
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,200
I heard she had a miscarriage,
with the same guy she ran away with.

633
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,040
She's here only to sell
the shop in the old town.

634
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,759
Money in her pocket and Samra's off!

635
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,832
How can you know that?

636
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,040
She came to my agency.

637
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,749
To see if she could extend her
return ticket... to New York.

638
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,520
Don't tell me you're on her side?
- I'm not on anybody's side,

639
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,115
I just know Fuke loves her.
It's not easy for him.

640
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,238
If only...

641
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,673
B&H ARMY OFFENSIVE
ENDS IN A BLOODBATH

642
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,028
Fuke?

643
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,595
Uncle.

644
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,639
Here's an apple,
if you feel like it.

645
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,754
Thanks.

646
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,754
Look... It fits you nicely.

647
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,918
Just look at this.

648
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:19,110
It's really the one...
It looks smaller now.

649
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,273
You've grown...

650
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,320
One string is missing.
I tried to find it,

651
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,914
but nobody in this neighborhood
has a mandolin.

652
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,718
There's a music shop in the center,
they should have it.

653
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,874
I didn't mean to fix it for real,
it's just for fun.

654
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,357
It's fine without the string,
it has been for years.

655
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,429
Let me see.

656
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,433
You can put any wire off a roll.

657
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,913
What roll?

658
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,676
Any roll. From any engine.

659
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,076
My nails can't handle this.

660
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,353
Uncle.
- Yes?

661
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,718
You should really look after
yourself a bit more.

662
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,598
I do look after myself.

663
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,473
I mean, you should...
get it out of your mind.

664
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,590
You can't tell your mind
what to do...

665
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,390
I mean... you could talk to Sheila.

666
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,272
She neglected my child.

667
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,311
How can that be, uncle?
- Just like that.

668
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:29,159
If she wants to marry again,
nobody can stop her,

669
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,269
nobody can stop anybody!

670
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,278
At least...

671
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,753
...for Aida's sake.

672
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,839
He walked her to the house,
the entire neighborhood saw them.

673
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,432
There can be no such infidelity
in my house!

674
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,040
I know how you feel, I know it all...

675
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,312
but tell me: What Sheila can do?

676
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,638
She can't spend entire life
mourning and living with memories.

677
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:14,000
She can't marry another,
she never left Emin!

678
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,160
Get it?

679
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,469
She's still married to him.

680
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,713
She never left my son.

681
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,516
That's not right.

682
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,111
Do you want me to call her?
To talk to her?

683
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,228
Whatever, I don't care what you do.

684
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,318
You took my happiness away,

685
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,677
But my heart knows no other love,

686
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,599
Sorrow is the only thing I feel,

687
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,519
And this endless pain is all I have.

688
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,152
I'll love nobody else
in a hundred lives,

689
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,112
I cry, but tears don't come
to my eyes,

690
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,998
My pain has no end, I cry,
but my tears are dry.

691
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,798
Sheila, it's Fuke.

692
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,148
We don't need any more firewood.
It's spring.

693
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,071
We need the force, mother.
The force.

694
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,592
Pick up some eggs on the way.

695
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,680
How can I jog with eggs?
- Slowly.

696
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,398
No eggs, no cakes.

697
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,309
Good morning, grandma.
- Good morning to you too.

698
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,672
It's fully charged,
but you can't say

699
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,510
if the situation is okay
with the electrics.

700
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,838
It must be something...
- I'll just set it on fire.

701
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,435
When did you fill it up?

702
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,035
I filled it up... last month.

703
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,114
Sabira said it must be the fuel.

704
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,040
No more for me.

705
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,235
Have another one,
while it's still hot.

706
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,557
Just a drop.

707
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,753
Some more for you?
- Okay, just a bit.

708
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,720
What's that? Somebody
left a car running outside?

709
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,680
Fuke left his car running,
to charge the battery.

710
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,240
Someone could steal it.
- No way,

711
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,672
not here.

712
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,953
I guess not.

713
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,556
Yes?

714
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,919
Is Ekrem there?
- Yes, come in, he's here.

715
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,311
Depends on who's wants to know!

716
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,598
Good morning.
- Good morning to you too.

717
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,070
Buba, come in...
- Thanks, I'm in a hurry.

718
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,160
Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Fuke.

719
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,230
I see the car's okay.
- Yes, finally.

720
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,630
Sorry to be rude.

721
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,592
Ekrem, what on earth are you doing?

722
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,280
What am I doing?

723
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,920
Don't make me tell you in front
of all these people.

724
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,831
Didn't we agree to go shopping?

725
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,994
We'll go, don't make a fuss
for nothing. What's the problem?

726
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,074
It's 10.30 already and you're
not even dressed... nothing?

727
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,915
How can you be so irresponsible?

728
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,080
What do you mean 'nothing'?
I'm dressed!

729
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,120
You're not coming with me
dressed like that!

730
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,759
In that tracksuit, you look like
a Montenegrin mobster!

731
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,548
You always have something
against Montenegrins!

732
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,995
They're people too.
Right, Fuke?

733
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,511
Sure they are.

734
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,271
And you just had to
agree with him.

735
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,469
Have a quick cup and then go.

736
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,797
Okay then, with milk,
I've got heartburn.

737
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,670
What kind of behavior was that?
- Why? I didn't... I just...

738
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,280
He left it running like that?
It will only get stolen.

739
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,556
Who would steal it?
- Fuke is such a sucker.

740
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,114
Samra, it's me.

741
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,714
I was just messing about
with the car.

742
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,759
Let me tell you...

743
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,875
I mean... I wanted to
tell you something... It's...

744
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,998
It doesn't matter where you live,
what matters is who you live with!

745
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,832
That's what I think.

746
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:15,119
Who... right, who you live WITH!

747
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,389
Right.

748
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,830
No, I haven't gone nuts...
Why would I...

749
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,313
What's up with you?

750
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,428
Go on now.

751
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,316
There, as if you haven't
been away at all.

752
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,794
You let them go?

753
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,919
Why not?
They would have just died.

754
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,755
They can't live on
coffee residue forever.

755
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,958
They better go while the earth
is still damp.

756
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,317
My dear Begzada,

757
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:23,870
summer draughts are coming
any day now, no transition time.

758
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,109
Right.

759
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,789
Thanks.

760
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,072
It's the same cake from yesterday.
What are you doing now?

761
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,560
I just want to give him
two fresh pieces.

762
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,836
These went dry in the night.

763
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,480
How could they go dry?

764
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,360
It's not the middle of the summer,
nights are not that warm.

765
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,557
On the contrary, the atmosphere
is sort of fresh in the evening.

766
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,675
Where did this plate come from?
I've almost forgotten all about it.

767
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,520
Begzada gave it to me a minute ago.
- My God...

768
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,840
This must be the new fashion,
sending candy to each other!

769
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,149
Does it really matter?

770
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,240
Should I return the bowl to Begzada?

771
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:36,028
Not until I'm done.
You'll just mix up the plates again.

772
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,636
I'll look for the heater right away
and I'll let you know if it matches.

773
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,960
If it doesn't, I'll see
with guys at work

774
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,560
where I could find an original one.

775
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,200
Thank you, my child.
Don't take too much trouble.

776
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,715
No trouble at all.
Let's fix it finally.

777
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,511
Take this cake to Zineta, please.
She'll enjoy it.

778
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,960
Thanks.
I was just telling uncle,

779
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,800
I'll call you as soon as I've found
the heater for your boiler.

780
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,598
Thank you. Don't let us
trouble you too much.

781
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,680
You have so much to do anyway,
all the time.

782
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,910
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

783
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,640
There. Bye now.

784
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,596
Bye. And do come to visit.

785
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,956
And please, be very, very careful
about that Rovinj thing!

786
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,551
Don't worry, I will.

787
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,798
Good bye.

788
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,635
Idriz!

789
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,471
Idriz!
- Yes?

790
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,759
Is Fuke gone?

791
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,316
Yes. Didn't you see him leave?

792
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,030
I forgot to give him the pajamas.

793
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:25,159
I packed it and tried not to
forget it and look at this now.

794
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,760
You'll give it to him
next time he comes.

795
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,680
Now I feel bad about this.

796
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,035
He'll be back as soon
as he finds the heater.

797
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,553
You're making a draft again.
- I just wanted to air it a bit.

798
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,793
Air or no air, it's just a draft!

799
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,948
What is it? Did the window rip
the curtain again?

800
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,239
No, it's fine.

801
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:16,878
I think someone
tried on Emin's uniform.

802
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,709
Fuke. Who else?

803
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,233
Idriz!

804
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,638
Who's that?

805
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:30,240
How do I know? I can't see
through walls.

806
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,400
Maybe Fuke remembered
the pajamas.

807
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,356
Open the door and you'll know.

808
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:47,678
It's great that you came back,
she's killing me with the pajamas.

809
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,273
Aida's here.

810
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,955
There's grandpa.

811
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,349
Grandpa's... everything.

812
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,720
Did you see this?
- Does it work?

813
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,314
Of course it does.
Fuke sorted out the...

814
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,080
This is Izudin. My boss.

815
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,389
He drove us from Tuzla.
- Hello.

816
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,191
Please, come in.

817
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,271
Yes, please do.

818
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,271
What do we do now?

819
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,752
Will this be okay?

820
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,233
Yes, it will.

821
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,277
Let grandpa take that.

822
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,999
Look at this idiot.
They wouldn't park here

823
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,393
only if I put a sign that
it's mined!

824
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,314
My God, Sheila is here.

825
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,069
Give us the instrument, dad.

826
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,593
Sing that song
that gives me pain

827
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,551
I can't stand this kind of music.
- Fine.

828
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,792
My love for you
seems to be in vain

829
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,112
In this world
you're all I have

830
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,112
The peace of my soul
only you can save

831
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,832
The peace of my soul
only you can save

832
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,032
Days fly so fast,
alone you should not be

833
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,792
Nights fly so fast,
waiting is too long for me

834
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:30,039
Let us not cause each other pain,
or our lives will have gone in vain.

835
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,557
Is this a company car or his own?

836
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,950
Not you too. Just let me be.
- Why?

837
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,719
Don't leave it too thin.
- Okay.

838
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,916
Sing that song
that gives me pain

839
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,710
My love for you
seems to be in vain

840
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,356
Hard and cruel and cold,
this world will live on

841
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,276
but you and I, my love,
we will be gone

842
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,356
but you and I, my love,
we will be gone.

843
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,476
Days fly so fast,
alone you should not be

844
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:04,076
Nights fly so fast,
waiting is too long for me

845
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:14,028
Let us not cause each other pain,
or our lives will have gone in vain.

846
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,553
Where did this come from?

847
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,275
I thought someone
might come by.

848
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,956
Would you like one?
- No, thanks, I'm driving.

849
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,750
Let me ask you something.
You should know.

850
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:07,111
Is Rovinj in Croatia now,
or in Slovenia?

851
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,152
In Croatia. It's always been
in Croatia. - Thanks.

852
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,671
Is it the battery?

853
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,237
It's not the battery.

854
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,076
The whole system collapsed!
