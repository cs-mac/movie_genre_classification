1
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,192
- Bonjour, madame.
- Bonjour.

2
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,435
I want a small suite, please. Must be quiet.

3
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,994
I have a very charming one
facing the courtyard.

4
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,270
Will Madame please sign her name?

5
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,278
Merci, madame.
To save inconvenience later,

6
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,471
- will you kindly leave your passport here?
- Passport?

7
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,150
- I showed my passport at the airport.
- I'm sorry, but it's a government regulation.

8
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,997
Oh.

9
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,278
Travelling's becoming
quite complicated, isn't it?

10
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,515
Merci, madame. S'il vous plaît.

11
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,074
- Bonjour, madame.
- Will you show madame to 54?

12
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,111
Par ici, s'il vous plaît.

13
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,832
Is there anything wrong?

14
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,555
Not at all.
Everything will be all right, I assure you.

15
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,280
- Mrs Brown.
- Thank you.

16
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,433
- Trente-cinq francs.
- Don't you speak English?

17
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,471
Pas Anglais, monsieur.

18
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,590
Merci, monsieur. Merci.

19
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,269
- Don't I get anything back?
- Merci, monsieur. Merci.

20
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,312
No, no, money. Er... change.

21
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,069
- Er... back.
- Merci, monsieur. Merci beaucoup.

22
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,997
Oh, don't rub it in.

23
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,473
You want me to wait?

24
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,671
Merci beaucoup.

25
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,916
Amazing! You know,
I'm going to like Bolshevism.

26
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,030
Why, could you earn your own living?

27
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,595
No, that's the bad part about Bolshevism.
But it has merit.

28
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,110
Without the Revolution,
the Grand Duchess would be in Russia

29
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,628
instead of providing such a delightful salon.

30
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,478
And perhaps I should never have met you.

31
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,511
One for Your Highness.

32
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,073
- Who is this Mr Halton?
- I've never seen him before.

33
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,749
I think, an Englishman. He brings
best regards from Captain Buckler.

34
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,519
Captain Buckler? Oh, yes.

35
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,394
Let him wait in the reception room.
I'll be a few minutes.

36
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,952
The Grand Duchess will be delighted
to see you, but it will be a few moments.

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,833
If you will be so kind as to step in here.

38
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,948
- Rue de la Tour, 314.
- Pardon, madame.

39
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,833
- Oh, Rue de la Tour, trois quatorze.
- Ah, oui, madame.

40
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,189
Whom may I announce, madame?

41
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,231
Oh... Just say an old friend.

42
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,759
Listen, my man, this is very important.

43
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,837
How can I reach Miss Field?
What's that you say?

44
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,678
3467. What is it you want?

45
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,756
- Pardon me.
- Who's playing the piano?

46
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,791
- The Englishman.
- I'd forgotten him.

47
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,149
Pardon me.
There is a lady waiting to see you.

48
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,156
- Who is she?
- She said, an old friend.

49
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,476
Tell her to leave her address
and don't let her in again.

50
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,557
All I want is a cup of tea and a sandwich.

51
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,520
- Now!
- Mm-hm.

52
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,909
- It isn't possible.
- It is I.

53
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,951
Oh!

54
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,198
You look marvellous. You know, I haven't
seen you, not since I opened the salon.

55
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,630
- And I haven't heard from you in...
- In six years, Anna.

56
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,035
Six? Why didn't you write to me?

57
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,799
You know I always like
to keep track of my friends.

58
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,149
That's why I didn't write to you.

59
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,872
Oh! Oh.

60
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,559
Well, now, tell me everything.
How was Rome?

61
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,433
Rome? I haven't been in Rome for years.

62
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,471
Has your husband been transferred?

63
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,318
Husband? Oh, you mean Savoldi?

64
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,715
- That's right.
- Oh, I didn't marry him.

65
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,637
- I broke the engagement.
- Why?

66
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,071
- Forgotten.
- Oh.

67
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,955
- What are you doing now?
- At the moment, I'm in Paris.

68
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,952
By the way, I'm not in Paris. Can I trust you?

69
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,319
I swear.

70
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,390
Anna... I’m in a rather difficult situation.

71
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,954
- Serious?
- Very.

72
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,070
I really came to Paris to ask your advice.

73
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,476
- You know I always give sensible advice.
- Yes, I know.

74
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,990
Driving up here, I realised that
I don't want any sensible advice.

75
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,838
I want no sense, no logic, no reason.

76
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,871
It can't help me at the moment.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,070
- What's going on in Paris?
- Well...

78
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,714
Will you excuse me?

79
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,351
Hello. Hell...

80
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,629
Oh, it's you.
Look, may I call you back in ten minutes?

81
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,717
- Do you want me to go out?
- Just a moment.

82
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,311
You're so understanding.

83
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,915
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

84
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,436
So kind of you to see me.

85
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,358
I bring you best regards
from Captain Buckler.

86
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,073
- Captain Buckler?
- You remember Willy Buckler.

87
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,588
He always talked so much about you, and...

88
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,838
He told me, "If you want an amusing time
in Paris, go to the Grand Duchess and..."

89
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,438
And... here I am.

90
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,471
And there you are.

91
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,349
- So you want an amusing time in Paris.
- Well...

92
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,597
Well, we must see
that you have a very amusing time.

93
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,312
Sit down, please.

94
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,954
- Have you been in Paris before?
- Not since the war.

95
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,992
- How exciting for you.
- Yes, I'm thrilled.

96
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,470
And I'm so glad to meet you.

97
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,875
Thank you.

98
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,911
Be seated, please.

99
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,513
- You're going to see Paris at its best.
- I'm so glad.

100
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,755
Let me think. What could I suggest?

101
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,512
Oh, first of all,
you would like to see the Louvre museum.

102
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,109
The what?

103
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,516
One of the most interesting
picture galleries in the world.

104
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,835
You've heard of the Mona Lisa.

105
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,190
Er... yes, I, er... I believe I have.

106
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,470
Oh, you don't care for pictures?

107
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,080
Oh, I know. The Eiffel Tower.

108
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,755
You mean that...
that steel thing, stuck up in the air?

109
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,677
Do you know what I'm afraid of?

110
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,632
- What?
- I'm afraid you'll suggest Notre Dame.

111
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,079
I was just coming to that.

112
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,319
Madame. Even if you could give me
the history of each stone separately,

113
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,312
- I'm still not interested.
- Oh.

114
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,955
I've found, through life,
the days take care of themselves.

115
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,788
- It's the evenings that are so difficult.
- Oh, how stupid of me.

116
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,992
You want me to arrange a party for you.
A nice, large party.

117
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,111
- Not too large.
- Six?

118
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,232
Four?

119
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,077
Two?

120
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,197
Two is the best suggestion.

121
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,877
Why do you stare at me like that?

122
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,876
He's completely off his head.

123
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,151
What are you talking about?

124
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,794
Buckler. He described you
as "hard as nails".

125
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,799
Much older, and, erm... beginning to, er...

126
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,559
- Beginning to spread.
- How unkind of him.

127
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,239
I hope you don't think the description fits me.

128
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,953
If he'd said
one of the loveliest women in the world,

129
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,230
I'd have recognised you anywhere.

130
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,874
Encouraging. Thank you.

131
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,909
Now, I wonder which one of my friends
you would like.

132
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,315
- May I make a suggestion?
- Please.

133
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,591
It would make our mutual friend Buckler
very happy if, er...

134
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,870
- if you would dine with me.
- I'm engaged.

135
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,957
Oh. Well, then, don't bother any more.

136
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,630
I'll have a couple of boiled eggs,
a detective story, and go to bed.

137
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,673
Madame. Have you ever been
at the mercy of loneliness?

138
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,518
Have you ever been a stranger
in a strange city?

139
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,755
- Often.
- What did you do?

140
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,631
I cried.

141
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,871
Well, that's what I shall do.

142
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,471
Café Danube. Nine o'clock.

143
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,789
Eight-thirty.

144
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,831
Nine o'clock.

145
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,796
But, Your Highness...

146
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,718
Oh, by the way, I'm not the Grand Duchess.

147
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,909
What?

148
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,231
Quarter to nine.

149
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,876
Mr Halton.

150
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,990
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

151
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,395
- You are the Grand Duchess Anna.
- Yes.

152
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,399
Captain Buckler described you so accurately
I would have known you anywhere.

153
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,556
Oh, thank you so much.

154
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,991
Captain Buckler. I imagine he wants me
to arrange something for you.

155
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,873
Who would you like to meet?
What would you like to do?

156
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,831
Er...

157
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,189
I'd like to see the Louvre museum.

158
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,800
- The what?
- Yes, the Louvre,

159
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,877
the Eiffel Tower,
oh, and most of all, Notre Dame.

160
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,037
Are you sure you're a friend
of Captain Buckler's?

161
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,034
Mm-hm.

162
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,559
Well, well, well.

163
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,995
Afraid I can't do anything for you.

164
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,270
Oh, yes, you can.

165
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,993
Tell me the name of the lady
who was here a moment ago.

166
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,873
Lady? I don't know.

167
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,832
- Was there a lady here?
- Come, come, you know there was.

168
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,553
Really, I don't know. I swear.

169
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,919
All right.

170
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,871
Goodbye, Your Highness.

171
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,911
Mr Halton.
Why do you want to know her name?

172
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,550
Because I'm dining with her
at a quarter to nine.

173
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,994
You are a friend of Captain Buckler's.

174
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,632
What a lovely song. What's the name of it?

175
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,356
It has no name.
I just made it up for you, madame.

176
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,597
- And for you, monsieur, thank you.
- Thank you.

177
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,273
You must have been
very successful with women.

178
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,639
What makes you say that?

179
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,434
Nobody could order such a delicious dinner
who wasn't.

180
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,471
Am I a success with you?

181
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,391
Tremendous.

182
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,395
- I wonder if I am.
- Why do you doubt it?

183
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,319
Because, here we are at the dessert
and we know nothing about each other.

184
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,318
You won't tell me your name
or even let me tell you mine.

185
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,353
Oh dear. Didn't we settle all that at the soup,
and again at the salad?

186
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,437
Why spoil such a
perfect evening with names?

187
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,471
I don't want to know your name.

188
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,312
Whatever it is, I know it wouldn't suit you.

189
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,351
Thank you.

190
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,391
I should hate to risk it.

191
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,312
Besides, I know all about you.

192
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,272
You do?

193
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,915
Providence gave you
grey eyes, brown hair...

194
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,756
a charming smile.

195
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,831
Great attraction.

196
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,150
Everything else is unimportant.

197
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,559
I'm content.

198
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,631
You're married?

199
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,831
Back to the soup and the salad.

200
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,149
Why be so curious?

201
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,191
Jealous.

202
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,435
Just terribly jealous.

203
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,472
I thought we were going to have
an amusing evening

204
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,511
but now it's become serious.

205
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,031
Desperately.

206
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,234
Who are you? I must know.

207
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,628
- Isn't it obvious?
- Not to me.

208
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,558
- We meet at the Grand Duchess's house.
- Why were you there?

209
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,357
You meet me at five o'clock. And at ten
minutes past five, I agree to dine with you.

210
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,197
A complete stranger.

211
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,718
The shortest story in the world.

212
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,318
Now tell me the true one.

213
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,511
Very well, then. Perhaps it's dangerous
for you to be with me.

214
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,279
Perhaps I have a husband
who'll come in and shoot you.

215
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,190
Perhaps I'm a spy. A thief.

216
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,435
The police may come in and arrest me.

217
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,471
Both of us.

218
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,511
You're none of those things.

219
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,110
If you were, it wouldn't matter.

220
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,550
Now, or any other time.

221
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,791
I must have done something very nice
in my life to be so beautifully rewarded.

222
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,911
Do you really mean that?

223
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,837
And so much more.

224
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,991
You're an angel.

225
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,629
Angel, that's what I shall call you.

226
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,197
Angel.

227
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,995
You're cold.

228
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,190
Frightened.

229
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,800
- Of me?
- Much more serious.

230
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,631
I'm frightened of myself.

231
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,472
What a strange evening.

232
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,671
I dined with you to be amused, to laugh.

233
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,712
To laugh at you. And...

234
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,752
- And what?
- And say goodbye.

235
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,551
Could you?

236
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,799
I don't know. You must give me time.

237
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,591
Please, a fortnight. A week.

238
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,553
Next Wednesday at five o'clock
at the Grand Duchess.

239
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,639
Wait for me. If I come, I won't ask any
questions. I'll go wherever you ask me to.

240
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,240
- And if you don't come?
- Then you must forgive me.

241
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,669
Never look for me. Forget that I ever existed.

242
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,359
Swear.
Promise that you'll do that for me. Please.

243
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
If I did, it would be a promise I couldn't keep.

244
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,468
I don't care who you are or what you are.

245
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,358
- All I know is...
- What?

246
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,551
I love you.

247
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,034
You'll never go out of my life.

248
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,071
I'll never let you go.

249
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,591
Er... Merci beaucoup.

250
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,117
Angel!

251
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,751
Angel!

252
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,431
Angel.

253
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,718
- No other statement, Sir Frederick?
- No other statement, no.

254
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,548
- How's everything, Wilton?
- The Foreign Secretary is on the telephone.

255
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,876
Get me the minutes of Thursday's meeting.
Article 6, section 5b.

256
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,276
Also of Friday's meeting,
all of article, erm... 2.

257
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,512
Well, Mr Wilton? How are you?

258
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,835
- Glad to see you back, Graham.
- Thank you.

259
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,075
- How's everything at Geneva?
- Oh.

260
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,192
- Is there going to be a war?
- Well...

261
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,118
It looks as if Europe is going to have peace.

262
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,469
At least, for the next three weeks.

263
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,670
We had rather a hard fight, you know.

264
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,269
21 nations lined up against us. But we won.

265
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,232
- I hear France was making difficulties.
- Well...

266
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,238
- What can you expect from the French?
- Yes.

267
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,511
You realise the French delegate
hasn't even a manservant?

268
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,959
Appalling.

269
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,354
But the Russians
were the surprise of my life.

270
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,436
We had two Soviet delegates to dinner.

271
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,995
You may not believe it, but I assure you
they were properly dressed.

272
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,158
- Tail coats. White ties.
- Well, well, well.

273
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,476
- Maybe the Russians are going places.
- Oh, well, I...

274
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,431
wouldn't come to hasty conclusions.

275
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,948
They still dunk.

276
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,797
- I shan't need you any more tonight.
- Good night, sir.

277
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,832
Graham!

278
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,316
It would be outrageous,
you can't disturb the master at this time.

279
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,635
The telegram may contain matters of state.

280
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,070
But how would you justify it
if it were only a personal matter?

281
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,315
You'd be criticised very harshly.

282
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,796
My dear Mr Wilton, may I remind you
of what our master always says?

283
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,150
A statesman must have
the courage to be unpopular.

284
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,229
- What is it?
- A telegram, m'lady.

285
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,031
Oh, thank you.

286
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,630
- Oh!
- Aah!

287
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,478
Who's that? Who's that?

288
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,837
Oh!

289
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,871
Hello, darling.

290
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,195
I didn't want to wake you up.

291
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,710
You were sleeping so peacefully,
I hadn't the heart to disturb you.

292
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,830
You're always so considerate.

293
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,710
Oh, I watched you for a long time.

294
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,638
- You had the loveliest expression.
- I was dreaming.

295
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,148
- About me?
- Oh, naturally, of course.

296
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,113
I dreamt you were a great success
at the League of Nations.

297
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,039
Well, I was! Sweetheart,
your husband defeated 21 nations.

298
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,355
Oh. You must be worn out.

299
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,358
- Not at all. I feel better than ever.
- Good.

300
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,634
- What else did you dream about?
- Let me see.

301
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,114
Oh, yes. I came into the League of Nations,

302
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,720
dressed in the most striking Paris gown.

303
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,433
All the delegates rose to their feet,
staring at me.

304
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,950
But I walked straight to you.
I wanted to kiss you.

305
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,197
But you were talking. So I walked out.

306
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,152
I went to Egypt,
and from Egypt I went to China,

307
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,758
from China I went to Arabia.

308
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,438
I circled the whole globe.

309
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,392
Finally, I came back
to the League of Nations.

310
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,749
But you were still talking.

311
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,439
So I took you away. I took you to Paris.

312
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,914
We walked in the park at night.

313
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,599
You had your arm around me.

314
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,710
Suddenly, I sat down on a bench.

315
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,915
I was cold. Frightened.

316
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,951
- Of me?
- Huh?

317
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,629
Oh. I got mixed up.

318
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,671
I dreamt that yesterday.

319
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,280
Now, let me see. Oh, I have it.

320
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,596
I lost you in Paris.

321
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,030
Next thing I remember, we were here
at home and you were beating me.

322
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,196
Oh! What did you do?

323
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,991
I'm afraid to tell you.

324
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,350
I liked it. And then you started to kiss me.

325
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,475
And you liked that too?

326
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,670
Better than ever before.

327
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,950
You carried me upstairs.

328
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,514
- And?
- There was a knock at the door. I woke up.

329
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,313
- Oh. How cruel.
- No, how wonderful.

330
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,351
It's true the dream is over.

331
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,595
But it doesn't have to be.

332
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,279
Oh, I'm so glad you're home, my darling.

333
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,957
- Tell me, who knocked at the door?
- Oh, Graham.

334
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,717
- At this time of the night? Why?
- A telegram.

335
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,435
- Was it so important?
- I didn't open it, it was for you.

336
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,989
- Where is it?
- There on your table.

337
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,071
Bad news?

338
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,431
Very disturbing.

339
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,551
What's worrying you?

340
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,830
- France?
- No.

341
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,751
Yugoslavia.

342
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,559
- I hope you don't mind, I...
- That's all right, dear. I understand.

343
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,556
I understand perfectly.

344
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,955
- Night, dear.
- Good night, dear.

345
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,075
Good morning, sir.

346
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,111
Morning.

347
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,830
How's the weather today?

348
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,871
Not bad, sir.

349
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,039
Why, Wilton!

350
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,792
Darling, some thrilling news
from Mrs MacGillicuddy.

351
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,389
Wilton, this is the nicest thing
you've ever brought to the table.

352
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,351
- My congratulations.
- Thank you.

353
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,436
- And mine.
- Thank you, m'lady.

354
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,471
What a pretty girl.

355
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,273
All her friends think
she ought to act in the films.

356
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,392
You see, sir, she once was photographed in
a newsreel

357
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,431
at the funeral of Admiral Bennington.

358
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,677
She was standing on the pavement
just as the hearse went by.

359
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,836
I hope I don't seem disrespectful, sir,

360
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,236
but in my opinion, she stole the show
from the late Admiral.

361
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,033
- That's love.
- I'm sure she loves you just as much.

362
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,071
Oh, she worships me, sir.

363
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,636
But it was by no means an easy conquest.

364
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,990
The young lady didn't believe
in the institution of marriage.

365
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,996
- But you persuaded her.
- Oh, no.

366
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,635
Begging your pardon, sir, it was you, sir.
And you, m'lady.

367
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,874
- We?
- We?

368
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:26,074
I took the liberty of citing you both as an
example of how beautiful marriage can be,

369
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,111
and that convinced her.

370
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,599
- Did you hear that?
- Maybe we should stage a rousing quarrel,

371
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,790
so we won't feel quite so responsible.

372
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,593
- That's a lovely idea.
- What shall we quarrel about?

373
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,110
Well, I might say I'm a neglected wife.

374
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,631
No, darling. I'm afraid we couldn't quarrel
about that because I'd agree with you.

375
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,830
Oh, anyway, it's bad.

376
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,189
Complaining wives are such a bore.

377
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,117
We can find something better.

378
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,596
I have it. You're jealous.
A very charming woman is in love with me.

379
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,835
- I could believe that.
- Thank you.

380
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,757
But I wouldn't quarrel about it.

381
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,396
I would do just the opposite. I would try to be
twice as charming as the charming lady.

382
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,149
I'm sure it wouldn't be difficult for you.

383
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,509
- Oh, you're an angel.
- Thank you.

384
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,558
- Frederick?
- Yes, dear?

385
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,795
Someone is in love with me.

386
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,990
I'm crazy about him.

387
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,669
I've decided to leave you.
I'm already packed.

388
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,591
I wonder what you would do.

389
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,633
I certainly wouldn't quarrel.
It would be too late.

390
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,229
Darling, isn't it a shame?
Here we are, two intelligent people,

391
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,669
and we can't find anything to quarrel about.

392
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,075
- We're complete failures.
- Perhaps we are.

393
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,112
I'm sure we are.
We might just as well face it.

394
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,312
We're a hopelessly happy married couple.

395
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,592
Hm.

396
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,319
- What's that?
- Oh...

397
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,158
Just... just something I made up.

398
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,112
That's nice.

399
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,470
It's beautiful. Darling,
I didn't know you had so much talent.

400
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,829
- Let's hear the rest of it.
- Oh, no, no.

401
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,552
- Come on. Don't be timid.
- No.

402
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,716
- Let's hear it.
- I'm not in the mood.

403
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,194
- Temperamental artist, eh?
- No, not exactly.

404
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,118
But you see, I don't know
what the end is going to be.

405
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,720
You've certainly found a lovely beginning.

406
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,399
- Almost too lovely.
- Oh, you must finish it.

407
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,637
It's not so easy. Well, I don't know.

408
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,911
The beginning is so beautiful,
I wonder if the end matters.

409
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,028
It's an old tune, but it's still good.

410
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,548
Of course, I play it badly.

411
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,160
But you danced divinely.

412
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,078
- I'm not such a good dancer.
- You were a rotten dancer.

413
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,237
You stepped on my toes
and you ruined my shoes.

414
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,595
But still, I say you danced divinely.

415
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,631
Ah.

416
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,910
What's the matter?

417
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,951
You took me back to Vienna.

418
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,273
Now, was that nice?

419
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,310
What was the name of that little hotel?

420
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,319
Hm. I don't remember the name
or how we got there.

421
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,397
- All I remember is...
- It was glorious, wasn't it?

422
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,556
- And what a hotel.
- Let's forget it.

423
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,751
Oh! Oh, no. I could never forget it.

424
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,872
The service was too awful.
They had every inconvenience.

425
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,879
Do you realise there was no lift?
We climbed four flights of stairs.

426
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,911
Sometimes two at a time.

427
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,554
What a hotel.

428
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,717
And when we got to the top of the stairs,
what did we find?

429
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,910
Two small, badly-furnished rooms.

430
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,868
- Were there two?
- Certainly, there was a sitting room, darling.

431
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,671
Oh, Christopher, I'm so excited.
This is the thrill of my life.

432
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,996
I don't wanna miss a thing.
You must tell me who everybody is.

433
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,316
- Afternoon, Mr Breckinbridge.
- Oh! Is that Mr Breckinbridge?

434
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,157
- Yes, yes indeed.
- Oh, my.

435
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,795
Very modest man. You wouldn't dream
he's Lord Straighton's butler.

436
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,876
How do you do, Mademoiselle Maupois.

437
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,878
- Lady Fellingham's personal maid.
- You don't say.

438
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,310
This is so fascinating,
seeing all these people in the flesh.

439
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,032
- Love me?
- Insanely.

440
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,275
Hello, John. Interesting case.

441
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,630
He was Lord Aldergate's valet for 20 years,
but it didn't last.

442
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,750
They differed in their political views.

443
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,032
Situation finally became impossible when
Lord Aldergate joined the Labour Party.

444
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,230
- Hello, George.
- Hiya, Toots.

445
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,475
Oh, hello!

446
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,557
- Who's that?
- Er... an American chauffeur.

447
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,829
Now, let's see if I can find Lady Barker.

448
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,074
There she is.

449
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,509
In the black dress,
in front of the staircase.

450
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,834
What has happened?
She seems a bit upset.

451
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,471
- It's nothing serious?
- No, no.

452
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,432
- Just a headache, but it's annoying.
- I'll go with you.

453
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,153
No. I'll lie down for an hour and be all right.

454
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,668
- You go back to your guests.
- Pardon me. May I?

455
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,676
- It's for Consolidated Press.
- Yes.

456
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,278
- Thank you.
- I'd rather not.

457
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,799
- One second.
- Please, no.

458
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,434
- I'm sorry. Some other time.
- Thank you, sir. Yes.

459
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,472
I hope you don't mind
but I'm not in the mood for a picture.

460
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,114
- I know I don't look well.
- That's all right.

461
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,151
Are you sure I can't take you home?

462
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,191
Positive. You stay and have a good time.

463
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,915
- Take her Ladyship home. Drive carefully.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,151
- Oh, how is your wife?
- She'll be all right. Just a headache.

465
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,430
- Don't forget Saturday.
- No. One o'clock.

466
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,549
One o'clock. Right.

467
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,275
- There's your ticket, old man.
- Oh, thank you, Tony.

468
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,312
- I wonder if you're right about Landslide.
- I think she's the best bet of the day.

469
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,955
Oh, I'm getting a lot of interesting fellows
together for Saturday.

470
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,230
Good. Which one is Landslide?

471
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,271
Oh, yes. There she is.

472
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,471
- Who's going to be there on Saturday?
- The Duke of Amesbury,

473
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,876
Earl of Avonborough, Argentine
ambassador, about 20 of us.

474
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,911
Pleasant luncheon?

475
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,428
Yes, very nice, very nice indeed.

476
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,792
I'm glad of this opportunity
to meet you, Sir Frederick.

477
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,798
- I've been looking forward to it.
- Thanks.

478
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,599
I've a feeling you and I might find
some very interesting things to talk about.

479
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,077
I'm quite sure we could.
Yes, these are very exciting times.

480
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,111
- Sir Frederick...
- Yes?

481
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,031
I wonder if you know who I am.

482
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,789
Well, certainly. Devon's told me
about you. You're his house guest.

483
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,912
- You were in India for quite a while.
- Right.

484
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,793
I still wonder if you know who I am.

485
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,035
Mr Halton, aren't you?

486
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,640
Yes. Doesn't that name
mean anything to you?

487
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,989
I'm sorry. I'm at a complete loss.

488
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,671
Sir Frederick, you once deliberately
stole my overcoat.

489
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,838
- I beg your pardon?
- But I helped myself to a pair of your gloves.

490
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,189
This... sounds like a mystery story.

491
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,231
No, no, just a war anecdote.

492
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,760
Oh! What was your regiment?

493
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,271
- I was in the Warwickshire. 10th Battalion.
- I was Leicesters. Machine guns.

494
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,039
I don't think the two regiments
ever came together.

495
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:23,438
Neither did we. But during 1916 and 17,
you went to Paris several times on leave.

496
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,948
Yes, that's right, I did.

497
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,230
You were very young.

498
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,475
- And she was charming.
- Who?

499
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,271
Paulette.

500
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,031
Do you mean...

501
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,071
Paulette Fouchardière?

502
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,231
Paulette Fouchardière.

503
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,032
Modiste. Third floor.

504
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,710
Hem stitching and embroidery.

505
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,871
Are you Poochie?

506
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,634
Yes, Schnoogie.

507
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,240
Well!

508
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,271
Let me have a look at you.

509
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,039
- You didn't have a moustache then.
- No.

510
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,991
Your picture was on the small table...

511
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,873
- Next to the little silver box...
- With the bird on top.

512
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,038
- And when you opened it...
- It played O Sole Mio.

513
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,355
Ah, she was lovely, wasn't she?

514
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,437
- Paulette Fouchardière.
- Mm.

515
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,917
Oh... what a rotten trick Napoleon
played on her great-great-grandfather.

516
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,155
Mm. If Napoleon had kept his promise...

517
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,749
- After the Battle of Valenciennes...
- Which Grandpapa really won.

518
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,678
Grandpapa would have
married the Duchess of Parma.

519
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,793
And Paulette would have become
the Princess of Naples.

520
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,990
I wonder whatever became of her.

521
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,868
To the Princess of Naples.

522
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,319
The Princess.

523
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,798
That's very kind of you, Lady Burnstead.
We'd love to come.

524
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,311
Your parties are always so delightful. But,
you see, we intend to leave next Saturday.

525
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,511
Yes, I'm terribly excited.
It's our first trip in ages.

526
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,073
Well, thank you so much.

527
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,318
My compliments to Lord Burnstead
and little Beatrice. Goodbye.

528
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,391
- May I come in?
- Of course.

529
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,348
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello, darling.

530
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,517
- Dressing already?
- The opera starts at eight, doesn't it?

531
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,028
- Oh, the opera, huh?
- Darling, you promised.

532
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,631
And I'm going to keep my promise. You love
opera, I hate opera, why shouldn't we go?

533
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,352
Have a nice luncheon?

534
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,439
I discussed the naval situation
with the French attaché. It looks promising.

535
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,871
You must have taken the navy all around the
world and discussed each ship separately.

536
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,593
Why? What time is it?

537
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,200
Oh, good heavens!

538
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,870
I meant to leave right after lunch, but...
Oh, I've lots of amusing things to tell you.

539
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,992
I met an old friend.
We were in the war together.

540
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,156
We began reminiscing.

541
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,715
We had a couple of drinks.
Good old Poochie.

542
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,799
- Good old what?
- Erm... Poochie, dear, Poochie.

543
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,513
Huh! What a curious name!

544
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,314
That's what we used to call him in the war.
Poochie Halton.

545
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,794
His real name is Anthony.

546
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,435
He once practically saved my life.
Great fellow, great fellow.

547
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,439
Don't you think you'd better get dressed?
We don't want to miss the overture.

548
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,552
Oh, no, we don't want to miss the overture.

549
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,033
We might as well see the whole thing
through from the bitter beginning.

550
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,833
Quite a fellow, this Halton.

551
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,359
Oh...

552
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,110
I say, did you ever hear of
a Grand Duchess Anna... Dmitrievna?

553
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,678
Anna Dmitrievna?

554
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,269
She's a Russian emigrée. Lives in Paris.

555
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,993
Yes, I've heard of her. Why?

556
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,918
This fellow Halton
told me the most fantastic story.

557
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,350
He's an extraordinary fe...
Isn't this my nailfile?

558
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,868
- I don't know, darling.
- It is, dear. It is.

559
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,629
- How do you suppose it got here?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

560
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,434
Graham, would you be good enough
to hand me my nailfile?

561
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,036
- You're going to the opera, sir?
- Yes, that's where I'm going.

562
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,709
If I may say so, sir, my favourite opera
is Cavelleria Rusticana.

563
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,910
It's only one act, but it has everything.

564
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,193
Love, jealousy, hate, murder,
and all in 35 minutes. I timed it once.

565
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,710
The one where the husband suspects
his wife of singing with another man?

566
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,355
And catches them.
Right in the middle of a beautiful duet.

567
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,631
- He kills her, doesn't he?
- Not immediately, no, sir.

568
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,638
- He joins them in the most exquisite trio.
- Naturally.

569
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,275
After Cavelleria Rusticana,
my favourite is The Barber Of Seville.

570
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,835
- The barber's song is particularly beautiful.
- How does it go?

571
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,111
Dee, da da da, da da da, da da da, ta ta

572
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,912
Tiddly-ya, tiddly-ya, tiddly-ya

573
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,872
Ta, ta ta ta, ta ta ta, ta ta ta ta ta!

574
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,595
Tiddly-ya, tiddly-ya, tiddly-ya,
tiddly-ya, tiddly-ya, tiddly-ya...

575
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,270
Graham, whoever persuaded you to become
a valet must have been a music lover.

576
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,629
Oh, thank you, sir.

577
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,439
- Shall I draw your bath, sir?
- Please.

578
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,591
You were saying something a while ago
about this Grand Duchess Anna.

579
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,952
Yes. Well, this fellow Halton's
gone completely mad over a woman.

580
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,754
A very nice fellow. Lived four years in India,
some fine government work.

581
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,078
The man has a splendid career ahead of
him. I hope he doesn't do anything foolish.

582
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,238
- You mean because of this woman?
- He can't seem to get her out of his mind.

583
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,273
Do you know where he met her?
At this Grand Duchess's salon.

584
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,510
Remember the novel,
An Afternoon In Paris?

585
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,836
- Yes.
- It's undoubtedly the same kind of place.

586
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,071
Oh, I see.

587
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,231
And that's where he met the woman?

588
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,670
Gives you a pretty accurate picture
of a lady. Obvious, isn't it?

589
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,154
Oh, it's probably just an adventure.

590
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,479
Not with him. Why, that man's been looking
for her in every possible place in Paris.

591
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,909
What's more, he's going back again.

592
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,236
His mind is made up.
Nobody can talk him out of it.

593
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,110
Dear, Mary Glenbrook over there.

594
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,432
Hmm, everybody seems to be here tonight.

595
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,989
Everybody seems to be looking at us.

596
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,031
At you, rather.

597
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,590
Do you suppose your friend is here?

598
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,077
Halton? No, he couldn't come.
He's telephoning tomorrow.

599
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,715
He's trying to cancel an engagement
and have lunch with us. All right?

600
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,719
- Yes, why not?
- They certainly are looking at you.

601
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,233
You know, a man shouldn't take a woman
seriously unless he can be proud of her.

602
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,317
At least she should be fit
to sit at the head of his table.

603
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,272
Not someone you just meet in Paris
in the afternoon,

604
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,393
and the same evening
she dines at your apartment.

605
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,556
- She went to his apartment?
- Certainly.

606
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,957
Darling, look. The Duchess of Loganshire,
over there to your left.

607
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,276
Naturally, he didn't say that.
He tried to romanticise the story.

608
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,711
A night in the park, a bouquet of violets.
The lady disappears.

609
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,270
Hello, old boy. So glad to see you.

610
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,598
It's been a long time since I've had
as many drinks as I had yesterday.

611
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,359
As a matter of fact,
I had a few too many myself.

612
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,278
I'm awfully glad
you got out of that other engagement.

613
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,197
You know...

614
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,109
Well, it's funny. I... I’ve only known you
since yesterday, and... yet I...

615
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,390
I feel the same way. It is funny, isn't it?

616
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,071
Well, come on, let's sit down.

617
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,118
I've been following your career
in the papers, old man.

618
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,355
I admire what you've done.

619
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,997
I admire your courage, your wit, and the
daring with which you tackle your problems.

620
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,315
I'm...

621
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,271
I'm proud to be in your house.

622
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,311
Thanks.

623
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,515
You know,
I've been thinking about you a great deal.

624
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,677
Now, I hope that little story of mine
hasn't worried you.

625
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,109
It's an unusual story.

626
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,720
I shouldn't mind reading it in a novel.

627
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,228
But I'd hate to be the hero of it.

628
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,953
Or even have...

629
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,991
...have a friend of mine...

630
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,471
Well, thanks, Barker.

631
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,399
Believe me, a man shouldn't go out of
his way to create handicaps for himself.

632
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,876
I imagine that's what Brutus told Caesar,
when Caesar said,

633
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,710
"Brutus, I've just met a little
Egyptian girl by the name of Cleopatra.

634
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,551
"She's driving me crazy."

635
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,910
If I remember my history correctly,
Caesar got over it.

636
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,953
Right. But my dear man,
Cleopatra wasn't Angel.

637
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,870
If Caesar had ever met Angel, it would have
changed the history of the Roman Empire.

638
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,309
It would have collapsed 200 years earlier.

639
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,035
Well, what are 200 years in history?
25 pages.

640
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,957
But one hour with Angel...

641
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,991
60 minutes.

642
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,154
3,600 seconds.

643
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,239
Well, I give up. It's always ridiculous
to reason with a man in love.

644
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,748
And I'm afraid you are a man in love.

645
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,351
I don't know. It may be more than love,
or less than love.

646
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,868
Well, man, make up your mind. What is it?

647
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,310
It's... It's a certain feeling.

648
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,593
It's a secret that belongs to two people,
and to those two people alone.

649
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,914
Something you can't...

650
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,191
Good heavens, haven't you ever
lost your head over a woman?

651
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,279
Haven't you ever felt that at last
you can stop searching? You've found it.

652
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,678
Yes, I have.

653
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,517
And you're going to meet her.

654
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,836
Halton, I'm afraid you and I
expect different things from love.

655
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,757
Probably from life.

656
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,315
I don't measure in terms of seconds,
but of years.

657
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,238
- How about a gin and tonic?
- Not a bad idea.

658
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,557
- It's a charming place you have here.
- Like it?

659
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,630
I say, that's a lovely picture.

660
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,073
- That's your wife's photograph, I suppose?
- Naturally.

661
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,397
- Mr Halton has arrived, m'lady.
- Thank you.

662
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,316
- Here...
- How do you do, Mr Halton?

663
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,873
How do you do?

664
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,914
My husband told me so much about you.
Won't you sit down?

665
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,471
- Cigarette?
- Thank you.

666
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,431
Thank you, dear.

667
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,518
- I hope I didn't come down too soon.
- Of course not.

668
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,155
Reunion of two old friends.
Are you sure I didn't interrupt?

669
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,760
We'd just finished
a most interesting discussion.

670
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,872
The newest subject in the world. Love.

671
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,876
Oh. Love.

672
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,878
- But we disagreed completely.
- Really?

673
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,435
Yes, we see the same thing,
but with entirely different eyes.

674
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,359
It's amazing.
It's like two men looking at the same lamp.

675
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,756
One says the shade is blue.
The other one swears it's green.

676
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,631
- You forget, Barker...
- Frederick.

677
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,477
Oh, I'm sorry. Frederick.

678
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,188
We both could be right, you know.

679
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,913
Perhaps the lamp shade is blue.

680
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,351
But when you light it up,
it may be the greenest green in the world.

681
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,473
- Don't you think so, Lady Barker?
- Gentlemen, the sun is shining so brightly.

682
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,399
Don't you think it's rather early in the day
to be talking about lamps?

683
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,476
I'd rather talk about you, Mr Halton.

684
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,954
- You have been in India?
- Yes.

685
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,834
- Are you going to stay in England?
- He's going back to Paris in a day or so.

686
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,599
- Oh.
- Well, I may have to change my plans.

687
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,077
- That's interesting. When did this happen?
- Oh, as a matter of fact, today.

688
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,190
Yes, I may have to stay a little longer.

689
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,597
How fortunate for you to be here at the best
part of the year. There's so much going on.

690
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,679
There's the ballet, and next week
there'll be the Wimbledon tennis.

691
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,076
Oh, darling, I am afraid
we are going to miss the matches.

692
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,078
- Frederick and I are taking a little trip.
- Oh.

693
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,157
Did you make up your mind, dear,
where you want to go?

694
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,830
- Mmm, I've several very interesting ideas.
- I'm dying to hear them.

695
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,711
And now, shall we have lunch?

696
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,876
Mr Wilton, what do you think
of this fellow Halton?

697
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,356
Oh, nice fellow, but I should say a trifle dull.

698
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,076
He talks about Paris, Paris, Paris,
and again Paris.

699
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,836
- Give me the crumb tray.
- What is it?

700
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:05,398
The crumbs at her Ladyship's place.
She seems to be playing with the bread.

701
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,194
- Her Ladyship seems to be a bit nervous.
- No, merely bored.

702
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,677
And how this Halton brags! He knows a man
who knows every stone in Notre Dame.

703
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,790
Would you call that an accomplishment?

704
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,355
And who cares
how high the Eiffel Tower is? Do you?

705
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,473
Mr Wilton, we're used to
such brilliant conversation in this house,

706
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,637
that sometimes I wonder
if we're not a little spoiled.

707
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,879
Yes, quite true. There's always the danger
of one's becoming blasé.

708
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,716
Sir Frederick told a delightful joke.

709
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,876
The Scotchman who wanted to buy a piano?

710
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,753
- And ended up by humming.
- Good. He tells it superbly.

711
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,155
Things seem to be brightening up. I'm glad.

712
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,158
They must be finished.

713
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,038
Hello? Oh, it's you, Emma.

714
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:04,310
Well, we're at luncheon.
I'm pretty busy just now.

715
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,920
Yes, I am angry. Frankly, I'm furious.

716
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,989
Unless you can explain where you learned
the rumba, I'm through. Goodbye.

717
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,393
- Whose plate is this?
- Her Ladyship's.

718
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,877
Hardly touched. Can there be
anything wrong with the meat?

719
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,471
I hardly think so, Mr Wilton.
Perhaps she just had a late breakfast.

720
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,115
- Whose plate is this?
- Mr Halton's.

721
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,755
But he hasn't eaten, either.
It's obvious that he tried.

722
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,519
Maybe there is something wrong.

723
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,674
Let's see Sir Frederick's plate.

724
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,396
No, it's not the meat.
I tell you, Mr Halton talked so much...

725
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,635
Or maybe he doesn't like veal.

726
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,353
That's quite possible.
At any rate, make a note.

727
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,712
- If Mr Halton should come again, no veal.
- Very well, Mr Wilton.

728
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,317
- Splendid. Don't you think so, darling?
- Yes, beautiful.

729
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,920
- Thank you.
- The fact I like it doesn't mean anything.

730
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,349
- But Maria, she's a composer.
- Frederick!

731
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,868
- She composed the loveliest song.
- Please!

732
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,831
- Play it, darling.
- Why don't you?

733
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,155
Don't make us coax you.

734
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,672
All right. Now, let me see, how does it go?

735
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,790
You know, I think I've forgotten it.

736
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,071
Oh, that's too bad. It really was very nice.
Now, how did it go?

737
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,271
I heard a delightful tune in Paris.

738
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,197
I wonder if I remember it.

739
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:35,276
Gentlemen, you're both working too hard.
I insist that you relax, please.

740
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,754
I'll play you something even better.

741
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,791
Oh, Frederick went out.

742
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,990
It's a lovely waltz, isn't it?

743
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,316
First time I heard it,
I was dancing with Frederick.

744
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,157
Takes me right back to Vienna.

745
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,350
It was our first dance together.

746
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,671
I think it has a beautiful melodic quality,
don't you?

747
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,039
Hello, Angel.

748
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,313
- I beg your pardon?
- Angel.

749
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,240
What do you mean, Mr Halton?

750
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,831
- It seems incredible.
- What seems incredible?

751
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,393
That I should find you here, in this house.

752
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,151
His wife.

753
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,038
It's like a dream.

754
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,954
I still don't understand you, Mr Halton.

755
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,711
I don't understand you.

756
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,475
We're alone, Angel. Darling,
how long are you going to keep this up?

757
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,790
Mr Halton, you're obviously confusing me
with another woman.

758
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,831
Oh, no, I'm not.

759
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,030
There can't possibly be two of you.

760
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,196
I'm afraid there must be.

761
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,710
I haven't been in Paris for...
Oh, for the last six months.

762
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:33,878
- You haven't been in Paris for six months?
- I told you so. That should satisfy you.

763
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,316
It seems to be a terrific coincidence. The
lady with whom you had your adventure...

764
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,636
- Wasn't it more than that?
- Maybe it was.

765
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,990
- At least I thought so.
- Maybe the lady thought so, too.

766
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,397
But it's impossible for me to read the mind
of a woman I never saw nor heard of.

767
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,313
In other words, to you it was.
Just an adventure.

768
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,873
Now, Mr Halton, I insist that we settle this,
once and for all.

769
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,275
Look at me.

770
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,436
Look at me carefully.

771
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,029
And I'm sure that you will realise
as clearly as I do,

772
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,196
that I am Lady Barker,

773
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,356
and nobody else.

774
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:23,633
The resemblance is amazing.
I could have sworn it was you.

775
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,351
You have exactly her hair.

776
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,273
Her eyes.

777
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,231
Her skin.

778
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,149
Her lips.

779
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,471
But when I listen to you...

780
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,431
...I begin to see the difference.

781
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,432
You're not Angel.

782
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,234
I am greatly relieved.

783
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,633
- Will you forgive me?
- Naturally.

784
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,436
You know, Mr Halton, this resemblance will
always create embarrassment between us.

785
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:16,918
It's unfortunate, but for my own comfort
and peace, and certainly for yours,

786
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,714
don't you think you might find some excuse
not to come here any more?

787
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,948
You have a lovely home, Lady Barker.
It's in exquisite taste.

788
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,909
I suppose this is the kind of house
every woman dreams of having.

789
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,554
And you're the wife
of a charming and famous man.

790
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,674
- You must be very happy, Lady Barker.
- I am.

791
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,874
Don't be afraid. I won't play it.

792
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,991
I shall never play it.

793
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,480
I hope I never hear it again.

794
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,309
Thank you.

795
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,311
Maria...

796
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:40,189
I told you in Paris never to look for me, never
to recognise me wherever you find me.

797
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,392
- The whole thing must be forgotten.
- I told you I'd never keep such a promise.

798
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,149
All I know is that I love you,
and I'll never let you out of my life.

799
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:54,433
I will fight with everything at my command
if you should try to destroy my home.

800
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,677
Why did you ever come to Paris?
Tell me, why?

801
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,959
Why did you leave me and go back
to London? It doesn't seem to make sense.

802
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,515
None whatsoever. But it's the privilege
of a woman not to make sense.

803
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,552
Men who expect women to be logical
are failures in love.

804
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,636
Have you ever been in love?

805
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,949
Not with you. I never told you I loved you.
Never.

806
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,550
Can't you remember what I said?

807
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,311
Every word.

808
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,191
Every syllable.

809
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,351
You said you had grey eyes.

810
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,792
Brown hair.

811
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,351
Charming smile.

812
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,751
Great attraction.

813
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,277
You still have. That's why I want you to go.

814
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,915
Oh, go. Please, go. Every moment
you are here, my home is in danger.

815
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,394
Go, I beg you, I tell you.

816
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,431
Maria...

817
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,871
Angel...

818
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,190
Come in.

819
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,797
- Wilton, will you find Sir Frederick?
- Yes, m'lady.

820
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,638
At the present moment,
I am definitely against it.

821
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,875
Is Hamilton with you?

822
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,069
Come in.

823
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,838
Has he sent the papers over?

824
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:27,034
Good. No, I'm not disturbed,
but I'd rather worry now than later.

825
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,071
Right, thank you. Goodbye.

826
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,680
- I beg pardon, sir...
- Just a moment.

827
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,158
- What is it?
- Her Ladyship is asking for you, sir.

828
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,589
Oh, all right.

829
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,271
I'm expecting a call from Mr Hamilton.
Let me know immediately.

830
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,392
- I'm very sorry. Just one of those things.
- Darling.

831
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,113
- Hmm?
- I'm afraid Mr Halton has to leave.

832
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,159
Is it so late?

833
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,432
I'm terribly sorry, Tony. I was called
to the telephone. Do you really have to go?

834
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,072
Well, I don't know...

835
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:07,352
- How about another drink?
- I tried to persuade Mr Halton to stay.

836
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,152
But I'm a complete failure.

837
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,156
Failure? Lady Barker, really, I...

838
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,115
I had an engagement but now I must stay,
long enough to turn failure into success.

839
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,151
Good.

840
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,349
- I would like to have a drink, too.
- You? Whisky, darling?

841
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,951
Just a little. Just enough
to drink to our friend, Mr Halton.

842
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,949
Thank you, dear.

843
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,478
Here's to you, Mr Halton. And to Angel.

844
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,073
Mr Halton told me the most amazing thing
that happened to him in Paris.

845
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,395
Everything I told you. Do you mind?

846
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,591
Not at all.
Always good to get a woman's point of view.

847
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,394
It's a thrilling story and I listened
to every word with great suspense.

848
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,319
Mr Halton, you described every detail
with such love and care.

849
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:06,433
Yet you omitted the most important part.
You failed to describe the woman.

850
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,474
- Yes, what does she look like?
- It's difficult to find the exact words to...

851
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,317
Now, I think you are being unfair.

852
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:19,435
You can't leave us like the daily instalment
of a newspaper serial. To be continued.

853
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,277
You have aroused our interest.

854
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,630
Frederick and I are entitled
to know a lot more about the lady.

855
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,717
Now, I insist, Mr Halton.
What did she look like?

856
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,150
She was radiant... Exciting.

857
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,317
- These are generalities.
- You're talking like a poet.

858
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:41,312
I see. You want the matter-of-fact
description of, shall we say, a detective?

859
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,351
That's exactly what we want.

860
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,710
Well, then...

861
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,279
Her eyes were brown.

862
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,471
And her hair was dark.

863
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,919
May I be permitted to change your toast?

864
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,635
To the most charming hostess.
Yourself, Lady Barker.

865
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,671
Thank you.

866
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,593
Well, I must be going.

867
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,394
Thank you for a lovely afternoon.
Goodbye, Lady Barker.

868
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:18,513
Mr Halton, since I've had the privilege
of enjoying your confidence,

869
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,233
may I indulge in a little advice?

870
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,271
Do.

871
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,434
- Mr Hamilton on the telephone?
- Yes, sir.

872
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,631
Yes, Hamilton?

873
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,671
Yes, will you read it to me.

874
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,430
You wanted to give me some advice,
Lady Barker.

875
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,789
I'm afraid Angel is far from blameless.

876
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,276
But I think you should forget her,
and perhaps even forgive her.

877
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,153
- I've already forgiven her, but...
- But what?

878
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,590
- Paris. I'll be in Paris next Wednesday.
- It'll be useless.

879
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,518
- If there's one chance in a million...
- There's not.

880
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,597
- I'll wait at the Grand Duchess's.
- Torturing yourself.

881
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,792
I'll be there Wednesday at five o'clock.
I'll be there hours before.

882
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,910
All right, Hamilton. Goodbye.

883
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,389
- Well, goodbye.
- I'll see you out.

884
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,111
Goodbye, Tony.

885
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:23,075
- These papers came from Mr Hamilton, sir.
- Oh, good.

886
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,236
By the way, I'm going to Geneva.

887
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,273
- Didn't you tell me Mr Hamilton is going?
- I've changed my mind.

888
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,198
Oh, I thought
it was only a sub-committee meeting.

889
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:38,552
It is, and I'm sure Mr Hamilton would
handle it, but you know me, Greenwood.

890
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,991
- I'd be uncomfortable if I didn't go myself.
- I see, sir.

891
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,430
In that case, you won't require
the other reservations.

892
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,110
- Which other reservations?
- For your trip with Lady Barker.

893
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,878
I'd forgotten all about it.

894
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:06,390
- Frederick, you're not working, are you?
- I'm sorry, but something unexpected...

895
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,316
Frederick! Is this where we are going?

896
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,239
Why, that's wonderful!
Oh, darling, I can hardly wait.

897
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,875
Let's have a glorious time.
Let's be foolish again.

898
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,990
Oh, I can't tell you how much...

899
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,915
Why, what's the matter?

900
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,030
Well, dear...

901
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,152
Don't tell me. Don't tell me we are not going.

902
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,270
- Don't tell me now.
- You see... I don't know... You see...

903
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,230
- It's all right.
- You must understand...

904
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,512
Don't explain. It's very clear.
You have to do your duty.

905
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,836
- You know...
- I know. I know very well. Too well.

906
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:54,918
I can recite all the reasons.
I know them by heart.

907
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,675
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- It's all right, Mr Greenwood. Come in.

908
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,029
You go back to work.
Don't let me disturb you.

909
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,071
Thank you, darling.

910
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,995
- About the reservations, sir.
- Oh, yes?

911
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,955
The Geneva plane stops in Paris only 20
minutes. You'll require at least four hours.

912
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,833
More. I've a good many things
to discuss at the embassy.

913
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,668
I thought so, sir. The airways people
suggest a private plane.

914
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,951
They can put one of their newest machines
at your disposal,

915
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,197
the same plane
that Lady Barker chartered last week.

916
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,790
Lady Barker chartered a plane?

917
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,831
That's what they said, sir.

918
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:38,157
It, er... It must have been Wednesday.
You were in Geneva.

919
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,949
Yes, of course, I remember.
That's all right, I'll let you know later.

920
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,991
Very good, sir.

921
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,951
Give me Croydon 2046.

922
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,396
Is that Imperial Airways?
I want to speak to the manager.

923
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,431
Sir Frederick Barker.

924
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,315
Oh, good evening.

925
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,351
About that private plane.

926
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,398
Is it the same one that Lady Barker took?

927
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,392
Mm-hm.

928
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,431
She says it's not so fast.

929
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,396
Oh, you say it made Paris
in one hour and forty minutes?

930
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,391
That's very good.

931
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,549
I'll take it. All right, thank you.

932
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,511
Finished your work?

933
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,878
Quite.

934
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,950
- Frederick?
- Yes?

935
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,550
When are you leaving for Geneva?

936
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,513
On Wednesday morning, by plane.

937
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,229
Doesn't the plane stop in Paris?

938
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,078
Yes, I believe it does.

939
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:46,551
Couldn't you take me along as far as Paris,
and pick me up on your way back?

940
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,114
That's an excellent idea.

941
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,599
I really need some new clothes. I haven't
done any shopping for quite a while.

942
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:02,634
Besides, it'll do you good to get away
from London. Be a change for you.

943
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,508
Yes, it would.

944
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,712
I shall make arrangements for Wednesday,
shall I?

945
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,751
Thank you.

946
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,239
Hello? Oh, Sir Frederick.

947
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,510
Are you? Geneva?

948
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,630
When are you leaving?

949
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,033
Mm.

950
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,316
Yes? Yes, this is Lord Davington's house.

951
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,795
You wish to speak to Mr Halton?
Who's calling, please?

952
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,990
Just one moment, Sir Frederick.

953
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,116
- Attendez.
- Oui, monsieur.

954
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,830
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Bonjour.

955
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,874
I'd like to see the Grand Duchess,
if you please.

956
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,911
Thank you, monsieur.

957
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,911
Come in.

958
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,398
I'll come in a moment.

959
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,000
Now, Mr Halton, I wouldn't be impatient.

960
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,238
If a lady makes an appointment for five
o'clock, you shouldn't expect her until six.

961
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:19,070
The kind of lady who comes on time
really wouldn't be worth waiting for.

962
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:24,398
If you get bored, there's the cocktail bar.
You might find some interesting people.

963
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,876
- Thank you. I'll wait here.
- Just as you like.

964
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,992
You may be sure we'll let you know
the moment she arrives.

965
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,157
Angel. Charming name, Mr Halton.

966
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,952
Bravo.

967
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,957
- Sir Frederick.
- Yes.

968
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,072
I am the Grand Duchess Anna.
How do you do?

969
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,190
Will you step this way, please?

970
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,950
- Will you sit down?
- Thank you.

971
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,639
To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?

972
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,948
Well, at a party a few days ago,
your name was mentioned.

973
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,309
And the charm and glamour of your salon.

974
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,670
Oh, thank you very much.
I hope you won't be disappointed.

975
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:16,679
It's after five. You might find some
interesting people at the cocktail bar.

976
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,915
- No, I think not.
- Or a little roulette?

977
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,430
Or if you've no plans,
I might arrange a little dinner.

978
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,914
You're very kind, Your Highness.

979
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,111
But, you know, at this party I just referred to,

980
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,674
a certain young lady was mentioned...

981
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,553
and her description roused my curiosity.

982
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,879
I'd be glad to do anything I can to arrange an
introduction, if you give me the lady's name.

983
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:42,595
That's the difficulty.
Her name seems to be rather a mystery.

984
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,154
But I wonder if this might give you a clue.

985
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:48,988
The person describing her
referred to her... as Angel.

986
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:55,036
Angel? Angel, that's a strange name.
Rather charming. But I'm afraid...

987
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:59,915
Erm... look here, Your Highness. Is there any
way in which I might refresh your memory?

988
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:05,114
Really, I have an excellent memory, but
I don't seem to remember that name at all.

989
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,515
Perhaps this might help, Your Highness.

990
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:11,951
I would contribute generously
to any charitable institution you might name.

991
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,592
Oh. Well... l... er...

992
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:17,633
Or perhaps it would be better if the
contribution were placed at your disposal.

993
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:22,708
Oh, that's very kind of you. We always have
the needy with us, but unfortunately...

994
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,318
Come in.

995
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,999
Pardon me, Your Highness.
Your Aunt Sonya is here.

996
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,349
Always these interruptions!

997
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,789
- Well, she'll have to wait. I'm sorry.
- Yes.

998
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,991
Just a moment, Gregori.
Perhaps I'd better see her.

999
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,793
She's an elderly lady. Would you mind?

1000
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,400
- I'll be back in a moment.
- Not at all.

1001
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,508
- Hello, Frederick.
- Hello, Maria.

1002
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:33,639
- Strange place to meet you, isn't it?
- Rather strange.

1003
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,877
- May I ask what you are doing here?
- Curiosity.

1004
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,478
The lady known as Angel
caught my imagination.

1005
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:45,275
You mean you stayed in Paris? You
actually missed the conference in Geneva?

1006
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,437
Merely to find out if Angel is a brunette.

1007
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,950
Well, Frederick, that's marvellous.
I can hardly believe it.

1008
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,470
You let all Europe wait
just to find out if a woman is a brunette.

1009
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,511
Or a blonde.

1010
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,279
As a matter of fact, she is a blonde. You
remember Mr Halton described the lady?

1011
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:07,677
- Yes, he seemed rather uncomfortable.
- Shall I tell you why?

1012
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,393
Before you came in,
he described her differently.

1013
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,193
- Would you like to know what he said?
- Very much.

1014
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,395
He said she had blonde hair, blue eyes,

1015
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,149
my figure and a slight foreign accent.

1016
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,475
Sounds like a description of you.

1017
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,511
It does, doesn't it?

1018
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:31,268
It annoyed me that there should be
another woman who looks exactly like me.

1019
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:35,836
It disturbed my vanity. You know how
women are. So I came here to find out.

1020
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,598
Did you see her?

1021
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,918
Oh, yes.
As a matter of fact, she's in the next room.

1022
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,111
And does she look like you?

1023
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,798
Exactly.

1024
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,912
You were in Paris last Wednesday.

1025
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,793
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you ask me?

1026
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,877
Did you ever ask me what I do
when you go to Geneva,

1027
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,388
and you have your conferences,
your committees?

1028
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,355
- Did you ever ask me anything?
- How many times have we been here?

1029
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,392
- Are you interested?
- What life have you been leading?

1030
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:09,238
- What kind of woman are you?
- Does it really worry you?

1031
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,032
As much as Yugoslavia worries you?

1032
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,356
How many times
have you been here before? Answer me.

1033
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,356
Frederick, you're getting nervous.

1034
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,313
To think that my wife, whom I trusted,
whom I was proud of,

1035
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,629
to think you could come to a place like this...

1036
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,830
Frederick, you're jealous.

1037
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,676
Angel. You are Angel.

1038
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,713
Now, why should I be Angel?
Why should I be so foolish?

1039
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,637
Why should I do such a thing?

1040
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,193
Don't I have a lovely home,

1041
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:41,392
a celebrated husband, the best servants,
every comfort, social position?

1042
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,238
Is there anything more a woman could ask?

1043
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,477
Why should I be Angel?
What reason could I have?

1044
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,156
Perhaps you can think of one.

1045
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,480
Frederick?

1046
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,075
Now, Frederick, if you go into that room,

1047
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,759
I'm afraid our marriage is over.

1048
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:14,190
If you find Angel in there,
you'll be happy that I'm not Angel,

1049
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:17,277
and you'll want to continue our old life.

1050
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,959
That would not be satisfactory to me.

1051
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,514
And if I don't find Angel?

1052
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,950
In that case, you'll want to see
your lawyer as soon as possible.

1053
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,798
On the other hand, if you don't go in at all,

1054
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,794
you'll be a little uncertain,
you won't be quite so sure of yourself.

1055
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,229
Or of me.

1056
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,350
And that might be wonderful.

1057
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,677
- Did you tell Mr Halton the lady was here?
- No, Your Highness.

1058
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,870
He must have seen her come out of the taxi.

1059
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,274
Who told you I came?

1060
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,595
I understand Frederick's here.

1061
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,677
He's in the other room. Or maybe he's gone.

1062
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,632
I don't know. Anyway, it's all over.

1063
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:45,598
Silly how upsetting a little thing like
saying goodbye to one's husband can be.

1064
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,431
Silly, isn't it?

1065
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,917
- Hello, Tony.
- Hello, Frederick.

1066
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:39,239
You know the... that story you told me
about Angel interested me so much

1067
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,397
that I couldn't resist coming here.

1068
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,718
Well... I’ve met her.

1069
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:55,630
You see, Maria, in the last few moments,

1070
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,831
I've thought more about our married life

1071
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,599
than in all the years we've been together.

1072
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:06,475
And all I know is...
the train to Vienna leaves at ten.

1073
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:13,954
I... I don't know how you feel about... Vienna.

1074
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,840
You've plenty of time to think it over.

1075
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,598
Well...

1076
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,108
I say goodbye to Angel.

1077
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:28,909
And so must you, Maria,
if you decide to meet me at the station.
