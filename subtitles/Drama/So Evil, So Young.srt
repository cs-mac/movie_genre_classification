1
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:56,884
My name is Ash,
and I am a slave.

2
00:00:57,093 --> 00:00:59,887
- Aah !

3
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:02,723
Close as I can figure it,
the year is 1300 A.D.,

4
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:05,351
and I'm being
dragged to my death.

5
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,187
It wasn't always
like this.

6
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:12,108
I had
a real life once.

7
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:14,527
A job.

8
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:19,490
Ash to price check four.

9
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,076
Um, hardware, aisle 12.

10
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:24,245
Shop smart.
Shop S-mart.

11
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:29,125
I had a wonderful
girlfriend, Linda.

12
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,256
Together, we drove to
a small cabin in the mountains.

13
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,761
It seems an archaeologist
had come to this remote place...

14
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,764
to translate and study
his latest find,

15
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:47,101
"Necronomicon Ex Mortis,"

16
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,230
"The Book of the Dead."

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,901
Bound in human flesh
and inked in blood,

18
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,447
this ancient Sumerian text
contained bizarre burial rites,

19
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:04,702
funerary incantations
and demon resurrection passages.

20
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:07,830
It was never meant
for the world of the living.

21
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,169
The book awoke
something dark in the woods.

22
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,635
It took Linda.

23
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:23,679
- And then it came for me.

24
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:26,849
It got into my hand
and it went bad.

25
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:29,477
So I lopped it off
at the wrist.

26
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,361
But that didn't stop it.
It came back.

27
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,156
- Big time.

28
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,825
Ah !

29
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:48,579
Aah !

30
00:02:57,713 --> 00:03:01,008
My God !

31
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:03,052
How do you stop it ?

32
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:01,861
- Surround the stranger !

33
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:07,700
All right,
you men, fall in !

34
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:14,582
All o' ya, keep a pace !

35
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,835
Where in the hell--

36
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,802
Stand fast, hellhound !

37
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,306
No, no.
Easy now, chief.

38
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:32,266
Uh, I don't know
how I got here,

39
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:36,771
- and, uh, uh, I'm not
looking for any trouble.

40
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:43,236
What a piece of armor this is !

41
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:45,905
- Wise man !
- Fall back ! Come on, all you men.

42
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:49,492
Back on your horses.
Come on !

43
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,913
My lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.

44
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:56,415
He who's prophesied to fall
from the heavens...

45
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:59,418
and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.

46
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:01,212
What, that buffoon ?

47
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,756
Likely...

48
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:05,800
he's one
of Henry's men !

49
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:09,929
- Kneel, rapscallions !

50
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,807
I say
to the pit with him !

51
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:16,978
You shall soon
learn the horrors of the pit.

52
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:20,523
- To the pit !
- You miserable bast--

53
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:25,778
- Get him !
- Get off of me !

54
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:29,198
- Let me go !
- Chain him !

55
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:33,828
Ah, you're gonna have
a little bit of wee fun, mate.

56
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:39,792
To the castle !

57
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,963
Pick up your feet !
Stop draggin' your feet !

58
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:46,299
Come on !
Move along !

59
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:48,467
Come on, now.

60
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:51,512
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this !

61
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,731
You men got something
to look forward to...

62
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:05,443
when you get back to the castle.

63
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:07,445
Lord Arthur approaches !

64
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:10,531
Raise the portcullis !

65
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,871
Lord Arthur !
Lord Arthur approaches !

66
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,710
That's lovely, isn't it ?
Move it in.

67
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,672
Move it,
you worthless--

68
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:30,384
- Get on !

69
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:48,486
Move it up, boys.
God save the king !

70
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:51,447
God save the king.
We love him !

71
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:57,036
Arthur !
He's back !

72
00:06:57,245 --> 00:07:01,874
Lord Arthur, where is my brother ?
Did he not ride with you ?

73
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,043
Aye,
and fought valiantly.

74
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:07,630
But last night he fell in battle
to Duke Henry's men.

75
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,882
I'm sorry, Sheila.

76
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:11,759
Come on.

77
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:15,221
You cretin !
Ah, stop it, you bastard !

78
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:19,392
You barbarian !

79
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,436
- Oh, no ! Stop it ! Stop it !

80
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,814
Get outta here,
you little brat !

81
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:32,697
Foul thing !
A pox on you, brute !

82
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:35,825
Thou art a murderer !
A black murderer !

83
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:42,957
My brother's death
shall be avenged !

84
00:07:57,722 --> 00:08:01,350
Company, halt !

85
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,106
Get that yoke off 'im !

86
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:10,443
Kill them !

87
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:12,528
Put them into the pit !

88
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:23,581
You, sir,
are not one of my vassals.

89
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:26,000
Who are you ?

90
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:28,961
Who wants to know ?

91
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,130
I am Henry the Red,

92
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:35,676
Duke of Shael, Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

93
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:39,805
Well, hello,
Mr. Fancy Pants.

94
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:42,850
I got news for you, pal. You ain't
leadin' but two things right now--

95
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,895
Jack and shit,
and Jack left town.

96
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:47,230
Shut your bleedin' hole !

97
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:48,814
Shut your bleedin' hole !

98
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:52,610
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur !

99
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:02,453
There is an evil
awakened in this land,

100
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:06,207
and while my people fight
for their very souls against it,

101
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:09,210
you, Henry the Red,
wage war on us !

102
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:13,422
Charlatan !
Aah !

103
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:16,342
It was you who first turned
your swords on us !

104
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:19,428
And this evil has befouled
my people as well !

105
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:22,431
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...

106
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,559
that lies in the bowels of that pit.

107
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,520
Right, you're no better.

108
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:30,064
May God
have mercy upon your souls.

109
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:49,542
God's name !
What hell-spawned thing lurks there ?

110
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:57,091
Into the pit with those
bloodthirsty sons of 'hores !

111
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,512
No ! No !

112
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:04,557
No, no ! Aah !

113
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:35,421
Oh ! Heavenly God !

114
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,383
He's escaping !

115
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:43,262
- Hold to !
- Hold him !

116
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,503
- Who's next ?
- It's him. Aye, he trembles !

117
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:19,048
They don't look
so clever now, do they ?

118
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:23,594
He's frightened !
He's frightened white !

119
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:25,972
Whoa ! Whoa !

120
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,933
Wait a minute. Hold it.

121
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:33,521
W-Wait a minute.
You gotta understand, man.

122
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:36,190
I never even saw
these assholes before.

123
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,359
- Get him in there !
- He trembles !

124
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:40,486
He's begging !

125
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:43,155
- What are you waitin' for ?
- Henry !

126
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,199
You gotta tell him
you don't know me.

127
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:49,620
We never met.
Tell him.

128
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,375
I do not think
he'll listen, lad.

129
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:55,710
Look.

130
00:11:55,918 --> 00:12:00,673
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

131
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:13,352
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

132
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:17,148
Uh, wh-whoa.

133
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:19,692
- Aah !

134
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:12,870
How do you like the pit ?
Isn't the pit wonderful ?

135
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:28,094
- Hai-ya !

136
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:32,223
- Why, you--

137
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,976
Ha !

138
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:37,019
Spikes.

139
00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:41,691
Hey ! He says, "Spikes."
Give him spikes !

140
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:58,457
Make way !
Strange one !

141
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:11,179
- Strange one !

142
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:16,559
Yaaah !

143
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:20,646
Yes !

144
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:36,579
Damn you.
Damn you !

145
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:05,209
You know,
your shoelace is untied.

146
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:17,263
All right.

147
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:20,183
Who wants some ?

148
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:23,853
Who's next, huh ?

149
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,938
How 'bout it ?

150
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:28,524
Who wants some, huh ?

151
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:32,612
Who wants
to have a little ?

152
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:39,911
You.
You want some more ?

153
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:43,414
Huh ?

154
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:47,168
You want a little ?

155
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:50,463
Do ya ? Do ya ?
Do ya want some more?

156
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:54,842
Huh ? Huh ?

157
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:11,776
Now get on those horses
and get outta here.

158
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:17,031
Let 'em go !

159
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:40,888
- Halt !

160
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:44,350
Thank you, generous hosts !

161
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,979
Sword boy !

162
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:59,365
For that arrogance,
I shall see you dead.

163
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:10,543
Yeah.

164
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:14,589
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

165
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:16,966
See this ?

166
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:21,846
- This is my boom stick !

167
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:24,390
It's a 12-gauge,
double-barreled Remington.

168
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,475
S-mart's
top of the line.

169
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:29,604
You can find this in
the sporting goods department.

170
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:33,107
That's right. This sweet baby
was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

171
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:36,611
Retails for about $109.95.

172
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:41,532
It's got a walnut stock,
cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger.

173
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:45,036
That's right, shop smart.

174
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:48,289
Shop S-mart.
You got that ?

175
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:50,291
- Yes, sir. Right.
- Yes, sir.

176
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:52,502
Now I swear,

177
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,796
the next one
of you primates...

178
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:59,675
even touches me--

179
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:31,457
Now, let's talk about
how I get back home.

180
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:04,490
I prithee to forgive me,
m'lord.

181
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:07,368
I believed thee
one of Henry's men.

182
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:11,581
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

183
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:14,166
Blow.

184
00:20:16,627 --> 00:20:19,755
So what's the deal ?
Can you send me back or not ?

185
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:22,508
Only the Necronomicon
has the power.

186
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,844
An unholy book
which we also require.

187
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:28,639
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

188
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:32,643
Only you, The Promised One,
can quest for it.

189
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:36,105
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit.

190
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:41,527
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto, today, chop--

191
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:52,496
- You shall die !

192
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:02,423
You shall never obtain
the Necronomicon !

193
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:06,928
We shall feast
upon your souls !

194
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:13,893
Oh !

195
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:32,078
- It's a trick. Get an axe.

196
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:40,294
- Guards, stop it !

197
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:42,964
- Catch the witch !
- Death to the witch !

198
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:45,091
Have some porridge !

199
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,469
Ah, my eyes ! I'm blind !
Oh, God, I'm blind !

200
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,515
No, don't !

201
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:59,856
Yo, she-bitch.

202
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:02,817
- Let's go.

203
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,610
Ya-hoo !

204
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:06,988
Hee-ya !

205
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:10,616
- Hee-ya !

206
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:26,591
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites,

207
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,468
all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.

208
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:33,389
Now will thou
quest for the book ?

209
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,447
That one.

210
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,968
Hee-ya !

211
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:17,725
Groovy.

212
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:32,281
What's the matter ?
You raised in a barn ? Shut the door.

213
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,703
Probably was raised in a barn
with all the other primitives.

214
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:49,507
The wise men say that
thou art The Promised One.

215
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:55,137
'Tis said that thou wilt journey
for the book to help us,

216
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:57,598
and that thou wilt lead
our people against the evil.

217
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:03,145
The only reason I'm going
to get the book is to get home.

218
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,777
I believe that thou wilt be
leaving in the morning.

219
00:24:09,986 --> 00:24:12,029
Don't touch that, please.
Your primitive intellect...

220
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:14,115
wouldn't understand
alloys and compositions...

221
00:24:14,323 --> 00:24:19,161
and things with
molecular structures in the--

222
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:22,832
What are you
doin' here anyway ?

223
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,543
I wanted to say
that all of my--

224
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:28,087
all of my hopes and
prayers go with you,

225
00:24:28,296 --> 00:24:31,132
and I made this
for thee.

226
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,760
Good, I could use
a horse blanket.

227
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:59,577
Gimme some sugar, baby.

228
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:12,465
Hyah ! Come on, boy !

229
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,219
Hyah !

230
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,603
Hyah !

231
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:34,195
- Steady now. Whoa.

232
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:41,536
What ? What is it ?

233
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:44,330
This path will lead you
to an unholy place.

234
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:49,836
A cemetery. There,
the Necronomicon awaits.

235
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:55,883
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words,

236
00:25:56,092 --> 00:25:58,886
"Klaatu barada nikto."

237
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:02,682
Klaatu barada nikto.
Okay.

238
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,892
Well, repeat them.

239
00:26:05,101 --> 00:26:08,354
- Klaatu barada nikto.
- Again !

240
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:11,899
I got it, I got it !
I know your damn words, all right ?

241
00:26:12,108 --> 00:26:14,610
Now you get this straight,
the both of you.

242
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:17,697
If I get that book,
you send me back.

243
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:20,199
After that,
I'm history. Hyah !

244
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:02,658
What is it, boy ?

245
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,758
Hyah ! Come on !

246
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,352
Hyah ! Come on !

247
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:37,276
Aah ! Come on !

248
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:40,613
Come on, you !

249
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:28,513
Hey, let's scare
this guy good ! Come on.

250
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:32,016
Ramming speed !

251
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:39,899
Ooh !

252
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:42,902
Ready, aim, fire !

253
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,780
- Ooh !
- Get away !

254
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:47,907
Whoa !

255
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:50,076
- Oh, God ! Oh, no !
- Oh--

256
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:53,496
- Oh !
- You lousy little--

257
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:55,790
Oh, no !

258
00:29:55,998 --> 00:29:57,583
Ooh, no ! Oh, my !

259
00:29:57,792 --> 00:30:00,086
Uh, ooh, aah !

260
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:04,006
- Lift up !
- Oh, ooh-hoo-ha !

261
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:08,261
- Ooh, aah !

262
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:13,724
Aah-ha-ha !

263
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:22,942
Heh heh heh-heh--
Whoa !

264
00:30:23,276 --> 00:30:25,361
## London Bridge
is falling down #

265
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,447
# Falling down #

266
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:31,450
# Falling down #

267
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:34,370
- # My fair lady ## Ha !

268
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:44,964
Ooh !

269
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:47,717
Is he up ?
How is he ?

270
00:30:47,925 --> 00:30:51,470
Hey,
he's gettin' up.

271
00:30:55,183 --> 00:31:00,438
Hmm,
what a horrible nightmare.

272
00:31:00,813 --> 00:31:04,942
Wait a minute.
Oh, God !

273
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,028
I can't move !

274
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:12,867
Aah !

275
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:16,245
- And go !
- Open wide.

276
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:22,835
Geronimo !

277
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:25,046
- Hooray !
- Hooray !

278
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,905
- Ah !

279
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:55,368
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate, huh ?

280
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:08,840
How'd you like
the taste of that, huh ?

281
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,967
How'd you like the ta--

282
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:17,431
Aah, uh, ugh, oh !

283
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,352
Ah ! Oh !

284
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,523
Let me out !

285
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,404
Oh, dear God,
it's growing bigger !

286
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:51,799
Ooh, ooh, I'm blind.
I'm blind. Bleh.

287
00:32:55,469 --> 00:32:58,764
Yip, yip, yah !

288
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:04,437
Oh, hey ! Where are you takin' me ?
Uh, oh, ooh !

289
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:12,486
What are you ?

290
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:14,989
Are you me ?

291
00:33:15,198 --> 00:33:18,618
I'm bad Ash,
and you're good Ash.

292
00:33:18,826 --> 00:33:20,661
You're goody
little two-shoes.

293
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,874
## You're goody little two-shoes
goody little two-shoes #

294
00:33:25,082 --> 00:33:27,668
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

295
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:32,548
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

296
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:36,260
- Ow !

297
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:38,804
# Little goody two-shoes ##

298
00:33:42,892 --> 00:33:46,395
Aah !

299
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,988
Good, bad.
I'm the guy with the gun.

300
00:34:55,756 --> 00:35:01,387
That'll teach you.
Yeah, that'll teach you.

301
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:04,599
You shall never retrieve
the Necronomicon !

302
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:07,894
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it !

303
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:12,732
- What's that you got on your face ?
- Huh ?

304
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,652
I'll come back for you !

305
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:26,746
- Hyah !

306
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:30,416
Come on, boy !

307
00:35:37,673 --> 00:35:41,427
Hyah !

308
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:49,620
Three books ?

309
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,834
Wait a minute.
Hold it.

310
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:59,547
Nobody said anything
about three books.

311
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:01,549
L-Like what
am I supposed to do ?

312
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:08,306
Take one book,
or all books, or, or what ?

313
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:12,018
Well.

314
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,741
Whoa. Wrong book.

315
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:45,319
Ow !

316
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:52,660
Aah ! Ooh !

317
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,922
Ooh ! Ooh, you !

318
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:08,843
I'll get back to you.

319
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:10,052
Well...

320
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:11,345
Well...

321
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:14,974
seems fairly obvious.

322
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:23,191
Ooh, wait a minute. The words.
All right, all right, all right.

323
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,819
Say the words.

324
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,200
Klaatu... barada...

325
00:39:32,408 --> 00:39:35,953
Iu--

326
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,293
necktie.

327
00:39:42,502 --> 00:39:45,546
Nectar, n-- nickel.

328
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:48,341
Noodle.
It's an "N" word.

329
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:52,637
It's definitely
an "N" word.

330
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:57,225
It's definitely
an "N" word.

331
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:12,198
Klaatu barada n--

332
00:40:26,212 --> 00:40:31,050
Okay, then.
That's it.

333
00:40:40,726 --> 00:40:43,229
Hey. Wait a minute.

334
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:47,567
Everything's cool.
I said the words. I did !

335
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:53,406
- Oh ! Oh ! No, wait ! Oh !

336
00:40:58,995 --> 00:41:03,332
You people, seek cover !
To the parapet !

337
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,459
Seek your children !

338
00:41:05,668 --> 00:41:09,130
- Steady the horses !

339
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:12,925
Something's wrong.
Something's amiss.

340
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:48,836
Where'd you go ?
Where'd you g--

341
00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:14,487
Oh, oh, aah !

342
00:42:16,697 --> 00:42:18,658
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

343
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:26,999
Ow ! I'll crush ya !
I'll mash ya into paste, you bony cre--

344
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:50,439
- Hyah !

345
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:54,694
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part.

346
00:42:54,902 --> 00:42:58,531
Now I want back,
like in the deal. Hyah !

347
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,087
I... live...

348
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:16,883
again.

349
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:30,771
There ! The Promised One !
The Promised One's returned !

350
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,651
Raise the portcullis !

351
00:43:37,403 --> 00:43:42,909
Welcome home !
We're saved !

352
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:47,121
- The Necronomicon !
- Truly he is The Promised One !

353
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,790
- He's brought the Necronomicon !
- How are ya ?

354
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:52,960
- He's brought the book !
- Yeah, great, great.

355
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:55,046
- Good boy !
- Get the fuck outta my face !

356
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:06,432
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon ?

357
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:10,520
- Yeah, it's, it's just that--
- Just what ?

358
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:14,273
Nothin'.
Here.

359
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:22,198
Now send me back.
Like in the deal.

360
00:44:22,406 --> 00:44:27,245
When you removed the Necronomicon from
the cradle, did you speak the words ?

361
00:44:27,453 --> 00:44:30,122
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words ?

362
00:44:30,331 --> 00:44:32,917
Look, maybe I didn't say every
single, little tiny syllable,

363
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:36,045
- no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
- Dung-eating fool !

364
00:44:36,254 --> 00:44:39,882
Thou hast doomed us all !
When thou misspoke the words,

365
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:42,009
the army
of the dead awoke !

366
00:44:42,218 --> 00:44:44,428
Now, whoa, whoa,
right there, spinach chin.

367
00:44:44,637 --> 00:44:47,723
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.

368
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:51,394
You said there was a passage that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.

369
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:53,980
It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back,

370
00:44:54,188 --> 00:44:55,982
but to us
it is useless !

371
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,651
The evil has a terrible hunger
for the Necronomicon,

372
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,654
and it will come here
to get it.

373
00:45:01,863 --> 00:45:04,407
We had a deal.

374
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:07,326
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for ya.

375
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:09,495
I did my part,
now you send me back.

376
00:45:09,704 --> 00:45:12,248
Very well.
As we are men of our word,

377
00:45:12,456 --> 00:45:16,294
we shall honor
our bargain.

378
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:20,381
The wise men shall return you
to your own time.

379
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,341
Yeah ?

380
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,719
- I thought he was the one.
- Yeah, right.

381
00:45:24,927 --> 00:45:26,804
'Cause that
was the deal.

382
00:45:27,013 --> 00:45:29,348
So when do you think
we can...

383
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:32,351
start with all
the thing and the--

384
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,395
He's nothin'
but a traitor, he is !

385
00:45:34,604 --> 00:45:36,397
When do you
think we can start...

386
00:45:36,606 --> 00:45:40,026
with all the, uh,
ceremony and, uh--

387
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:42,069
Agh ! Wretched excuse
for a man !

388
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:47,033
The wise men were fools
to trust in you.

389
00:45:47,241 --> 00:45:49,035
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

390
00:45:49,243 --> 00:45:51,913
We put our trust in him.

391
00:45:52,121 --> 00:45:54,874
I still believe
that thou wilt help us.

392
00:45:55,082 --> 00:46:00,505
Oh, Sheila,
don't you get it ? It's over.

393
00:46:00,505 --> 00:46:04,467
I didn't have
what it took.

394
00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:08,304
So long.

395
00:46:10,515 --> 00:46:12,308
But what of the things
that we've shared ?

396
00:46:12,517 --> 00:46:15,895
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private ?

397
00:46:16,103 --> 00:46:18,564
Aw, well--

398
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:22,777
Well, that's just what we call
"pillow talk," baby. That's all.

399
00:46:22,985 --> 00:46:26,405
It was more than that.

400
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:29,242
I still have faith
in thee.

401
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:34,539
I still believe that thou
wilt stay and save us. I--

402
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:42,046
Coward !

403
00:46:43,005 --> 00:46:44,966
- Look there ! A demon !

404
00:47:01,482 --> 00:47:04,485
Ash ! Help me !

405
00:47:04,694 --> 00:47:07,196
Sheila !

406
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:14,370
Yaaah !

407
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,503
- Shoot the bloody thing !
- Hold your arms ! You'll hit the girl !

408
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:30,553
Uh, me sword !

409
00:47:30,678 --> 00:47:33,347
Yaaah !

410
00:47:33,556 --> 00:47:35,141
Damn you !

411
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:58,122
Dig, damn you !
Dig faster !

412
00:47:58,331 --> 00:48:01,334
I shall command every
worm-infested son-of-a-bitch...

413
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:03,336
- that ever died in battle !
- Thank you, sir !

414
00:48:03,544 --> 00:48:05,588
- You there, handsomely now.
- Aye, my liege.

415
00:48:05,796 --> 00:48:08,216
We shall storm their castle
and get my book !

416
00:48:08,424 --> 00:48:12,678
Hoist,
you damnable varlets !

417
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:19,060
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

418
00:48:19,268 --> 00:48:22,855
Now pick up a shovel
and get digging !

419
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:28,152
- Bring on the wench !

420
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:43,334
- Gimme some sugar, baby.

421
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:45,878
Well.

422
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:50,466
Now, ain't you
a sweet little thing ?

423
00:48:50,675 --> 00:48:53,094
Don't touch me,
you foul thing !

424
00:48:53,302 --> 00:48:55,471
Come on.

425
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,392
That's it.

426
00:49:00,852 --> 00:49:04,897
We got plans for you, girly-girl.
Move !

427
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:09,277
Have you lost your bones,
you decomposed gobs ? Get thee hence !

428
00:49:18,327 --> 00:49:21,747
A scout approaches !

429
00:49:26,794 --> 00:49:29,755
- Whoa !
- Hey, get his horse.

430
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:31,757
Arise.

431
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:33,801
My lord, an army of the dead
gather in the wilderness.

432
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,262
- They approach the castle.
- How far from here?

433
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,805
But two days' ride.

434
00:49:38,014 --> 00:49:39,891
These winged ones
are only the first of them.

435
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:41,934
Perhaps we should leave
as soon as possible.

436
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,936
- We could be safe in the mountains.
- Yes, the mountains.

437
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:46,522
- We must flee !
- It is written. It has been foretold.

438
00:49:46,731 --> 00:49:48,900
- They'll take our souls.
They'll swallow our souls.
- I'm afraid !

439
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:52,236
- I don't want to die !

440
00:49:52,445 --> 00:49:56,782
That's it.
Go ahead and run.

441
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,785
Run home
and cry to mama !

442
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:05,291
Me ?
I'm through runnin' !

443
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:09,128
I say we stay here
and fight it out.

444
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:13,758
Are all men from
the future loudmouthed braggarts ?

445
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:18,804
Nope. Just me, baby.
Just me.

446
00:50:19,013 --> 00:50:23,351
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls ?

447
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:26,229
How will you fight that ?
More words ?

448
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:28,231
Most of our people
have already fled.

449
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:31,025
We are but 60 men.

450
00:50:31,234 --> 00:50:36,155
Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.

451
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:43,246
Now... who's with me ?

452
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,846
I'll stand by ya.

453
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:02,557
You can count on my steel.

454
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:04,600
I'll offer up my courage.

455
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:08,354
- Me sword's by his side.
- I'm with you !

456
00:51:08,563 --> 00:51:11,023
- I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.
- And mine !

457
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,486
We'll stay !

458
00:51:15,695 --> 00:51:18,698
Hail ! Hail !
Hail ! Hail !

459
00:51:18,906 --> 00:51:25,705
Hail ! Hail ! Hail !

460
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:35,214
Well, my dear,

461
00:51:35,423 --> 00:51:39,510
say hello to the boys.

462
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:48,019
- There's a sight for sore bones.

463
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,107
I may be bad,

464
00:51:53,316 --> 00:51:56,611
but I feel... good.

465
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:59,447
- Who rules ?
- To you, my lord.

466
00:51:59,655 --> 00:52:01,490
You, sir. To the castle.

467
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:05,203
The castle !

468
00:52:05,953 --> 00:52:07,830
Hurry up now.

469
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:10,416
The castle ! Let's push.

470
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:15,004
Heave-ho.
Good. Yeah.

471
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,939
Ha ! Hoo !

472
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:16,941
Hai-ya !

473
00:53:17,149 --> 00:53:20,361
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

474
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,990
Yeah !

475
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,579
They're coming !
The Deadites approach !

476
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:49,015
There's so damn
many of 'em.

477
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,560
Maybe--

478
00:53:52,768 --> 00:53:57,773
Just maybe my boys can stop 'em
from gettin' the book.

479
00:54:00,985 --> 00:54:02,820
Yeah.

480
00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:05,489
And maybe
I'm a Chinese jet pilot.

481
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:42,735
Battle stations ! All right, get those
rocks up, mister, on the double !

482
00:54:42,944 --> 00:54:49,200
Ready the catapults !
By God, let's give 'em what for.

483
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:58,459
And halt !

484
00:54:58,668 --> 00:55:03,714
- Company, halt !
- Company, halt !

485
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,265
I'll rip his balls off.

486
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:49,218
Bring forth the scout !

487
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,470
Whoa.

488
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:54,432
My lord, we are positioned
on both fronts.

489
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,977
Fine, fine, fine.
Where are they keeping my book ?

490
00:55:58,186 --> 00:56:00,980
There, my lord,
beyond the wall.

491
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:04,400
The parapet. That would be
the most likely place.

492
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:08,988
Right. Bring me forth
into that castle !

493
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:11,991
- Forward !
- Forward !

494
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,996
Cry havoc and let loose
the dogs of war !

495
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:19,790
To the castle !

496
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:23,461
Fly, mate ! Fly !

497
00:56:23,669 --> 00:56:27,965
Death to the mortals !

498
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:30,343
Arrows.

499
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:34,180
Torch boy !

500
00:57:08,047 --> 00:57:10,883
Steady.

501
00:57:16,264 --> 00:57:19,851
Fire !

502
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:26,023
- Advance, you beasts, advance !

503
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:37,410
Oh ! Oh !

504
00:57:38,828 --> 00:57:43,040
Yeah, baby !

505
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:50,464
- All right !

506
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:54,927
Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.

507
00:57:55,136 --> 00:57:59,599
Ram the gate !

508
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,811
Catapults.

509
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,147
Catapults out !

510
00:58:14,322 --> 00:58:16,657
Yeah !

511
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:20,786
Fire !

512
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:27,168
Look there !

513
00:58:31,047 --> 00:58:34,008
Yeah !

514
00:58:34,217 --> 00:58:37,553
- Seek cover !
- Watch out !

515
00:58:37,762 --> 00:58:41,307
- Make way !

516
00:58:50,149 --> 00:58:51,984
Oh !

517
00:58:52,193 --> 00:58:54,820
Oh, you miserable
bags of bones !

518
00:58:55,029 --> 00:58:57,865
Pick yourselves up
and sally fo...

519
00:59:00,076 --> 00:59:02,036
Sally for--

520
00:59:02,245 --> 00:59:05,706
Sally forth.

521
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:10,461
Come on,
you miserable wretches.

522
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:13,172
Lower.

523
00:59:13,381 --> 00:59:17,552
Heave !

524
00:59:21,222 --> 00:59:24,851
Forward !

525
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:29,313
Buttress the door, now !

526
00:59:38,281 --> 00:59:42,368
Hold fast !

527
00:59:44,287 --> 00:59:46,873
- Back !
- Stone these creatures !

528
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:50,835
Damn you !

529
00:59:51,752 --> 00:59:53,754
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

530
00:59:53,963 --> 00:59:56,382
Go, you creatures !
Arrows !

531
00:59:56,591 --> 01:00:00,011
Load !
Fire !

532
01:00:02,597 --> 01:00:05,933
- Heave ! Put your...

533
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:09,270
backbones into it.

534
01:00:09,478 --> 01:00:11,731
We've broken through !
The castle is ours !

535
01:00:17,153 --> 01:00:21,741
Kill the mortals !

536
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:27,496
- Get it achieved and fast !

537
01:00:40,968 --> 01:00:45,014
Their ranks are broken !
Have at them !

538
01:00:45,306 --> 01:00:50,311
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

539
01:00:55,608 --> 01:00:58,611
Pull back !
Man the parapet !

540
01:00:58,819 --> 01:01:00,613
Protect the book.

541
01:01:00,821 --> 01:01:04,575
God save us all.

542
01:01:08,037 --> 01:01:11,082
Say hello
to the 21st century. Yeah !

543
01:01:23,845 --> 01:01:27,098
Come on !
I got plenty for everybody !

544
01:01:27,306 --> 01:01:29,433
Look out !

545
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:32,436
- Whoo !

546
01:01:35,147 --> 01:01:39,110
- Bye-bye.

547
01:01:39,694 --> 01:01:43,364
It's the one in the cart we want !
Get him !

548
01:01:43,573 --> 01:01:47,994
- Yaaah !

549
01:01:53,749 --> 01:01:55,501
Yaaaaah !

550
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,359
Sheila ?

551
01:02:42,715 --> 01:02:45,426
- We've secured the courtyard, my lord.

552
01:02:45,635 --> 01:02:49,055
Excellent.

553
01:03:00,399 --> 01:03:03,861
Ooh ! Hey ! Look out !

554
01:03:09,408 --> 01:03:12,370
- Hey, you're mine, sweetie.

555
01:03:12,578 --> 01:03:15,998
Get off of her !

556
01:03:18,668 --> 01:03:20,461
Gotcha !

557
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:24,048
Damn you !

558
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:28,636
- My lord.
- Stay with the book.

559
01:03:28,845 --> 01:03:33,099
The book's where we are.

560
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:39,897
The Red ! The Red !
Duke Henry and his men have come !

561
01:03:41,065 --> 01:03:43,693
Blows, blood...

562
01:03:43,901 --> 01:03:48,239
and death !

563
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:52,493
Duke Henry ! Ha-ha !

564
01:03:58,124 --> 01:04:01,919
Die !

565
01:04:02,879 --> 01:04:07,925
Onward, valiant cousins !
Their ranks are broke !

566
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,975
Oops !

567
01:04:16,184 --> 01:04:20,438
Hello !

568
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,486
There ya go.

569
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:31,365
The book is mine.

570
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:41,334
I'll cut your gizzard out.

571
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:44,962
- Hey, where'd he go ?

572
01:04:54,096 --> 01:04:56,933
Come to papa.

573
01:04:57,141 --> 01:05:00,645
Get him !

574
01:05:25,378 --> 01:05:28,256
Oh, you crazy bitch,
get off of me !

575
01:05:28,464 --> 01:05:31,884
Ha !

576
01:05:34,595 --> 01:05:38,015
Right.

577
01:05:42,645 --> 01:05:45,439
You found me beautiful once.

578
01:05:45,648 --> 01:05:48,860
Honey, you got real ugly.

579
01:06:05,835 --> 01:06:09,255
There we are.

580
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:18,431
So you wanna
play rough, eh ?

581
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:22,685
Okay.

582
01:06:23,311 --> 01:06:28,107
Oh.

583
01:06:28,649 --> 01:06:33,112
All right, all right.

584
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:38,242
Prepare to die !

585
01:06:50,004 --> 01:06:52,590
You're going down !

586
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:56,719
- I'm goin' up.
- I'm comin' for ya.

587
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:08,564
Come on !

588
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,537
- Oops. Excuse me.
- Come on.

589
01:07:22,745 --> 01:07:25,665
All right !

590
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:31,045
You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch !

591
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:52,525
I'll spoil
those good looks.

592
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:56,362
Back-stabber !

593
01:07:58,823 --> 01:08:02,201
Hold still !

594
01:08:12,211 --> 01:08:14,672
Tallyho !

595
01:08:16,299 --> 01:08:19,719
- We can't hold the battlements!

596
01:08:19,927 --> 01:08:22,847
We will hold !
We must protect the book !

597
01:08:35,318 --> 01:08:37,153
I got a bone
to pick with you.

598
01:08:37,361 --> 01:08:41,365
Come on.

599
01:08:46,078 --> 01:08:49,582
Slice that gizzard open.

600
01:09:04,514 --> 01:09:08,351
Now you're mine.

601
01:09:08,809 --> 01:09:13,189
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

602
01:09:27,703 --> 01:09:31,749
At last, the book.

603
01:09:35,545 --> 01:09:37,755
I possess the Necronomicon.

604
01:09:37,964 --> 01:09:41,467
I've crushed your pathetic army.
Now I'll have my vengeance.

605
01:09:41,676 --> 01:09:45,304
Buckle up, bonehead,
'cause you're goin' for a ride.

606
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:49,225
Huh ?

607
01:10:00,236 --> 01:10:04,949
Victory's ours !

608
01:10:05,491 --> 01:10:10,997
- Retreat ! Retreat !
- Let's get the hell out of here !

609
01:10:35,813 --> 01:10:37,607
- Oh.
- Tricky ones, they are.

610
01:10:37,815 --> 01:10:40,026
If it's a fight you want--

611
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:45,156
Watch 'em, lads.
They're an untrust worthy lot.

612
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:32,286
Move yourself, lad !

613
01:11:32,495 --> 01:11:34,497
- Your hand, man. Godspeed !
- Hey, Henry. Yeah, nice goin'.

614
01:11:34,705 --> 01:11:36,499
- My lady.
- Arthur.

615
01:11:36,707 --> 01:11:39,794
- Well won, my friend.
- We've won the day.

616
01:11:40,002 --> 01:11:43,548
- Yeah !
- Yeah !

617
01:11:46,676 --> 01:11:52,223
We're brothers
and a new kingdom shall be born !

618
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:56,769
The book tells us that
once you drink this liquid...

619
01:11:56,978 --> 01:12:01,107
and recite the words,
"Klaatu barada nikto,"

620
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:05,611
thou shalt awaken
in thine own time.

621
01:12:06,153 --> 01:12:11,909
Remember, you must
recite the words exactly.

622
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:44,650
Hyah !

623
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:04,587
I thought about staying.

624
01:13:04,795 --> 01:13:09,383
They offered me the chance to lead them,
to teach them, to-- to be king.

625
01:13:09,592 --> 01:13:12,512
- Uh-huh.
- But my place is here.

626
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:17,183
- So I swallowed the juice,
said the words and here I am.
- Did you say...

627
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:19,936
the words
right this time ?

628
01:13:20,144 --> 01:13:23,231
Well, maybe I didn't say every
single, tiny little syllable, no,

629
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:27,151
but basically
I said 'em, yeah.

630
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,821
Basically.

631
01:13:32,114 --> 01:13:34,825
You know that story about
how you could've been king ?

632
01:13:35,034 --> 01:13:37,995
I, uh, I think
it's kind of cute.

633
01:13:38,204 --> 01:13:42,416
Yeah.

634
01:13:59,559 --> 01:14:04,063
- Die !

635
01:14:14,991 --> 01:14:18,286
Lady, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave the store.

636
01:14:18,494 --> 01:14:20,788
Who the hell are you ?

637
01:14:20,997 --> 01:14:23,624
Name's Ash.

638
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:25,751
Housewares.

639
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:48,983
I'll swallow your soul.

640
01:14:49,192 --> 01:14:53,362
Come get some.

641
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:14,926
Sure, I could've
stayed in the past.

642
01:15:15,134 --> 01:15:18,804
Could've even been king.

643
01:15:19,013 --> 01:15:21,557
But in my own way,

644
01:15:21,766 --> 01:15:24,769
I am king.

645
01:15:24,977 --> 01:15:28,648
Hail to the king, baby.
