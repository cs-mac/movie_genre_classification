1
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:10,994

2
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,372
<i>Liar!</i>

3
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,003
<i>All Liar!</i>

4
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,263
Liar!

5
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,941
<i>What's going on?</i>

6
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,611
<i>Courgette!</i>

7
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,991
<i>Courgette, answer when mama calls!</i>

8
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,326
<i>Hey, Courgette!</i>

9
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,086
Yes Mama.

10
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,839
<i>Who is going to clean it up? Mama?</i>

11
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,287
<i>Courgette!</i>

12
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,594
I didn't do it on purpose.
I'm sorry.

13
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,668
<i>What am I gonna do with you?</i>

14
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,723
<i>You'll regret this!</i>

15
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,468
- Please no, mama!
<i>- This is gonna hurt!</i>

16
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,712
No!

17
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,973
How old are you, son?

18
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,110
Nine.

19
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,114
Was your mama nice to you?

20
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,088
She drank a lot of beer.

21
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,342
She made good mashed potatoes
and sometimes we had fun.

22
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,835
Yes.

23
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,705
And sometimes not?

24
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,217
OK. Where is your father?

25
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,923
There.

26
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,096
And that's his chicken.

27
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,851
Mama always said,
he liked chicks too much.

28
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,158
Fine.

29
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,410
I'll take you to a place

30
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,287
with other children like you.

31
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,282
Without papas and mamas.

32
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,365
But I have a mama.

33
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,879
Your mama's gone, Icare*.
(Icarus)

34
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,506
My name is Courgette*!
(Zucchino)

35
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,250
Courgette...

36
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,246
Is that what your mama called you?

37
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,760
I'm Raymond.

38
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,821
Is that what your mama called you?

39
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:20,222
Yeah.

40
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,570
How about flying your kite?

41
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,552
Come on, big guy.

42
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,643
Good morning, Monsieur.

43
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,476
Good morning, Madame Principal.

44
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,274
May I present, Icare.

45
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,237
But, I think he prefers
to be called, Courgette.

46
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,155
Courgette?

47
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:03,584
That's what his mother called him,
and it seems important to him.

48
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:07,455
Isn't that so, buddy?
OK, come on.

49
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,396
Welcome to Les Fontaines,

50
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,514
Courgette.

51
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,259
Don't worry, you'll be fine here.

52
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,232
I'll come to visit you.

53
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,564
- Au revoir, Madame.
- Au revoir, Monsieur.

54
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,997
Shall we go?

55
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,503
Rosie will show you to your room.

56
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,089
There's a big drawer
where you can store all your stuff.

57
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,181
I'll leave you to it.
This is your bed.

58
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,723
You all right?

59
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,980
I'll let you put your stuff away
and wait in the hall.

60
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,776
Good morning, Madame!

61
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,315
Children, this is
your new classmate, Icare.

62
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,710
- Courgette.
- Ah, yes, pardon me.

63
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,990
Your new classmate, Courgette.

64
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,376
- I'd say, Potato-head!
- Simon, that's enough!

65
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,834
Calm down, children!

66
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,466
Well, I'll leave you to it.

67
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,047
See you later, Monsieur Paul.

68
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,182
Take a seat, big guy.

69
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,054
So, I'll resume...

70
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,199
<i>As I was saying,
the cow is a ruminant.</i>

71
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,576
<i>This means that she ruminates.</i>

72
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,829
<i>That is, first she swallows the grass,</i>

73
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,125
<i>without chewing it,
then brings it up later</i>

74
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,528
<i>and calmly chews it.</i>

75
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,914
<i>We don't exactly know why cows...</i>

76
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,675
Welcome to prison, Potato-head!

77
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,875
<i>Ooh, look out, hot Potato!</i>

78
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:23,592
You must have room in your nose,
from your excavations!

79
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,729
Stop it, Simon!

80
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,449
Shove over!

81
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,164
So, Potato-head, why are you here?
Huh? C'mon, tell me!

83
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,208
Why'd they bring you here?

84
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,344
Hold on, you got potatoes
on your plate.

85
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,188
Potato-head eating potatoes!

86
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:48,267
How bizarre!
Guys, Potato-head is a cannibal.

87
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,560
Enough, Simon!

88
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,886
If you're here it's because your parents
rejected you. They got rid of you.

89
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,653
A rotten potato...
for the compost heap!

90
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,406
Stop it! Shut your mouth!

91
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,866
Look, guys,
Alice has the shakes again.

92
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,868
What's with the band-aids?

93
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,221
Rosie put them on,
'cause I had a headache.

94
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,822
Stop, I'm fed up with your fork!

95
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,122
I'll soon find out why you're here.

96
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,833
I'll get it out of you!

97
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,835
Another autistic head case!

98
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,904
<i>C'mon, bedtime.</i>

99
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,948
<i>Everyone to their room</i>

100
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,284
<i>Good night, sweet dreams.</i>

101
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,562
<i>Straight to bed, tonight, guys!</i>

102
00:13:51,114 --> 00:13:53,691
<i>Shh! Courgette is already asleep.</i>

103
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:58,795
<i>- Ahmed, did you pee?</i>
<i>- Um, I think so.</i>

105
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,995
<i>- You think so, or are you sure?
- I think so.</i>

106
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,800
<i>You're a real dope, Ahmed.</i>

107
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,802
<i>Yeah, you're a real dope, dude!</i>

108
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:10,807
<i>- Ahmed is a bed wetting little girl!
- Stop it, now! - Come on! - He hit me.</i>

110
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,576
<i>Shh, good night kisses for everyone,
then it's lights out!</i>

111
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,819
<i>- Good night!
- Thank you.</i>

112
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,822
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

113
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,955
<i>Is Potato-head sleeping?</i>

114
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,918
No, Potato-head's not sleeping.

115
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,996
And he won't sleep the rest of the night.

116
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:26,787
<i>- C'mon, run, run!
- It's not flying yet.</i>

117
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,245
<i>- Faster!
- Yeah, you did it!</i>

118
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,347
<i>It's super high!</i>

119
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,126
<i>Let me have a go, please!</i>

120
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,011
Wow, see how it flies?

121
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,313
Let go of that!

122
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,191
Oh yeah?
What're you gonna do if I don't?

123
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,319
Take out your magic wand,
like Harry Potato-head?

124
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,697
Harry Potato-head!
That's so random!

125
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,450
<i>Fight, fight, fight!</i>

126
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,160
<i>Smash his face!</i>

127
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,953
<i>Kung-Fu-Courgette!</i>

128
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,698
Never touch my kite, got it?

129
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,291
No, I didn't quite get it.

130
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,669
Touch my stuff again,
and I break your arm!

131
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,171
Courgette has guts!

132
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,041
<i>- He's nuts!
- The guy's strong, huh?</i>

133
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,796
We were playing soccer, then he
came up, behind, and jumped me.

135
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,426
Courgette? Not saying anything?

136
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,974
I wanna go home to my mama.

137
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,308
Could you leave us, Simon?

138
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,701
That's impossible, Courgette.

139
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,411
She's gone.
Your mama is in heaven.

140
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,540
But, you'll be fine, here.

141
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,919
I promise.

142
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,010
Hey, Potato-head!

143
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,148
Courgette!

144
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,997
My parents took drugs.

145
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,616
Both of them.

146
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,574
All the time.

147
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,447
So, I was brought here.

148
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,402
Won't you tell me why
you're here?

149
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,509
I could tell you about the others.

150
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,841
I know their cases by heart.

151
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:48,058
You see, Bea?
Her mother was deported.

152
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,236
Shipped her back to Africa,
while Bea was in school.

153
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:58,927
Jujube's mother spends her time
opening and closing the fridge.

154
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,204
Click-clack, click-clack,
all the time.

155
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,524
Or she cleans the toilet for weeks.

156
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,501
She's totally sick.

157
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,629
C'mon, over here. Shoot!

158
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,533
<i>Ahmed's father did a hold-up.</i>

159
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,303
<i>Can you imagine?!
He held-up a gas station,</i>

160
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,389
<i>to buy him some Nike's.</i>

161
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,308
Want me to get Rosie?

162
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,839
<i>Alice's father did creepy things
to her, disgusting stuff.</i>

163
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,965
<i>Dunno exactly what.</i>

164
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,807
<i>But Alice had nightmares every night.</i>

165
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,315
He's in prison, now.

166
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,445
I think,
I may have killed my mama.

167
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,917
But I didn't mean to.

168
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,210
I didn't do it on purpose.

169
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,960
We're all the same.

170
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,530
We have no one to love us.

171
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,372
<i>Well... in the mornings,
we get up.</i>

172
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:37,126
<i>And there's Ahmed,
who wet his bed again.</i>

173
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,254
<i>Then we wash.</i>

174
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:47,261
<i>All except Simon.
He only pretends to wash.</i>

175
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,273
<i>And Jujube eats toothpaste.</i>

176
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,068
<i>'Cause his mom said it's healthy.</i>

177
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,070
There's the orangutan.

178
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,814
The Gorilla.

179
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:03,819
<i>At school, M. Paul tells us about
people who came before us.</i>

180
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,080
<i>They lived before soap even existed.</i>

181
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,358
<i>They never showered.</i>

182
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,501
<i>Like Simon.</i>

183
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,778
<i>Monsieur!</i>

184
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:17,366
<i>And then Jujube asks
to go to the nurse's office.</i>

185
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,368
<i>Because of the toothpaste.</i>

186
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:20,787
OK, Jujube.

187
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,055
<i>In the meantime we play
at being Cro-Magnon men.</i>

188
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,947
Well, that's all great.
Sounds fun.

189
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,066
Yeah, it's fun.

190
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,695
What is it, big guy?

191
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,579
It'll be less fun
when you stop coming.

192
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,932
You think I come
because I feel obliged to?

193
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,468
I dunno, it's your job.

194
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:06,295
No, it's not my job.
I come to see you because I like you.

195
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,050
I like you, too.

196
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,483
I don't think they like cops, much.

197
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:20,013
Especially, Ahmed. He thinks
you put his father in prison.

198
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,734
Good morning, Madame!

199
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,660
Mama!

200
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,734
<i>What does she want from me?</i>

201
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,374
<i>Come on, wake up!</i>

202
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,135
Move it, I have stuff to do.

203
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,624
Well, she's about as pleasant
as a prison gate!

204
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:52,611
Oh, no!

205
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,655
<i>She's probably in her room.</i>

206
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,914
<i>My poor little darling!</i>

207
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,166
<i>It's hard. Hard.</i>

208
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,419
<i>No, she's not here.</i>

209
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,551
<i>Then, she must be in the yard.</i>

210
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,095
- My name is Camille.
- Mm, mmph.

211
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,311
I'm Courgette.

212
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,821
Hey, new girl,
tell us why you're here.

213
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,829
- Ah, you're the boss, are you?
- Exactly.

214
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,487
- And we gotta do everything you say?
- Voila, you got it!

215
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:06,789
That's how to talk to girls.

216
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,587
All right.

217
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,557
I'm here

218
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,225
because my mother,

219
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,048
every morning,

220
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,405
made me...

221
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,608
go to school,
dressed as a dinosaur.

222
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,885
Oh, yeah?

223
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:26,426
Hey, you yanking my chain?

224
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,615
Watch it, I wouldn't laugh,
if I were you!

225
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,073
Anyway, I really like dinosaurs.

226
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,988
Bunch of lameo's!

227
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,874
Bye, boss!

228
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:50,863
Boss, boss, boss...

229
00:24:02,116 --> 00:24:05,043
- Hey, Simon!
- What is, squirt?

230
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:09,228
Can I ask you something?
You know, about how to do stuff.

231
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:12,684
- What stuff?
- The stuff that girls and boys do.

232
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:16,271
I know that stuff by heart,
my parents had films.

233
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,541
It's really weird stuff.
You move like so...

234
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,244
Then the girl moves, too,
and then... Pow! You see?

235
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:27,500
Waddaya mean, 'pow'?!
Your wiener explodes?

236
00:24:27,504 --> 00:24:30,998
- Yeah, it explodes.
- Seriously, Simon!

237
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,055
Well, you end up exhausted.

238
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,933
- Sooo, wiped out!
- And what does it do for the girls?

239
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,628
They totally sweat a lot
and they keep agreeing to stuff.

240
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:43,673
"Oh, yes, yes, yes!" like that.

241
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,233
Ah!

242
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,228
Nothing to say, Courgette?

243
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,196
<i>Courgette!</i>

244
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,975
<i>Oh, no, he has a crush,
that's what.</i>

245
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,736
<i>Oh, yeah? Got a crush?</i>

246
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,578
Totally random!

247
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,994
<i>Sure, you can see it, a mile away!
You're in love with Camille.</i>

248
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,329
I'd just like to know,
why she's here.

249
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:11,840
But... we know, why she's here.
Because of that dinosaur thing.

250
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:15,364
<i>I know why she's here.</i>

251
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:18,800
Do you REALLY wanna know
why she's here?

252
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,018
- Are you sure?
- Shh!

253
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,652
- What if we get caught?
- You wanna find out, or not? - Yes.

254
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,362
Hold this.

255
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,582
Ah, got it!

256
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,137
Now, then...

257
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,758
<i>Interesting.</i>

258
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:05,063
It's because she killed a guy.

259
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,512
- Because he was in love with her.
- What?

260
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,516
I'd be careful, if I were you.

261
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,822
And she has it in for guys
named after vegetables.

262
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,021
The guy's name was Carrot.

263
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,187
- Oh, stop it!
- Scared-ya, huh?

264
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,750
Actually, in fact,
her father killed her mother.

265
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,279
Because she loved another guy.

266
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,119
And then...

267
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,409
- he committed suicide.
- Show me.

268
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,919
It says, here,
Camille saw the whole thing.

269
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,672
Here, look.

270
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,793
Oh, yeah.

271
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,261
You can see it in her eyes.

272
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,847
You can see, that she saw it all.

That's what you call preliminaries.
If Rosie and M. Paul were in bed,

Rosie would sweat ten times more

- No, he's just in love.

Er... Is your wiener in good shape?

Well, if his wiener explodes,

00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:50,822
Everything would be so clear
<i>♪ alles wär' so klar. ♪♪</i>

326
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,054
<i>Hey, are you sleeping?</i>

327
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,395
No.

328
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,312
And you? Are you sleeping?

329
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,903
No.

330
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,369
And you?

331
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,290
Not yet.

332
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,923
Shh! Come.

333
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:08,235
I have something for you.
For your birthday.

334
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:13,233
- My birthday's passed.
- I know, but we hadn't met 3 months ago.

335
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,943
So I couldn't give you a gift. Here.

336
00:33:23,173 --> 00:33:24,823
Wow!

337
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,706
How do you know
my birthday was 3 months ago?

338
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,460
I snooped in Madame Papineau's office.

339
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,849
Then you know everything.

340
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,727
Uh... yeah.

341
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:55,149
When my parents died,
I went to live with my aunt.

342
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,903
The one who brought me the other day.

343
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,486
She's a real witch, for sure.

344
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,493
When we're alone,
she yells at me all the time.

345
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:11,375
Now, at the Foster Home it's fine.

346
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:20,463
Sometimes I dream I'm grown up
and still with my mother.

347
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:24,880
She still talks to herself
as she drinks beer.

348
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,932
And I drink a lot, too.

349
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,430
I'm happy, knowing that
this will never happen.

350
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:40,688
If they hadn't brought me here,
I'd have never known you.

351
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,264
Where'd you guys go?

352
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,641
- Did you explode your wiener?
- Be quiet, Jujube.

353
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,853
We were enjoying the snow,
because tomorrow we go back.

354
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:09,607
Oh, no, I don't wanna leave
it was my dream to see snow.

355
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,601
And ride horses.

356
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,313
C'mon, snowball fight!
Girls against boys!

357
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,070
<i>We've run out of ammunition.</i>

358
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,277
<i>Hello, Raymond,
everything's fine around here.</i>

359
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,913
<i>You know what?
A great thing happened.</i>

360
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:10,334
Ahmed, put your hand on it very gently
and you'll feel something.

361
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,627
<i>Rosie is expecting a baby.</i>

362
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,212
- Feel that?
- Yeah.

363
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,866
<i>All because of
Monsieur Paul's wiener, I think.</i>

364
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,125
<i>We feel miserable
'cause she'll go away.</i>

365
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,388
<i>But she says, we'll all have
a little brother.</i>

366
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,712
<i>We decided to call him Spiderman.</i>

367
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,605
Spiderman! Spiderman!

368
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,800
<i>I'm really looking forward
to seeing you again.</i>

369
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,941
<i>Oh, yeah, I meant to tell you
one more thing.</i>

370
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,811
<i>The new girl is called Camille.</i>

371
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:42,647
362, 363, 364, 365...

372
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,853
366, 367...

373
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,706
- What's your record?
- My record is 747.

374
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,166
- You're good.
- Someday I'll reach 1000.

375
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,546
I read in a book that
the world record is 27,075.

376
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,917
The girl skipped for 13 hours.

377
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,794
Oh, yeah? Not bad.

378
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,798
<i>347, 348, 349...</i>

379
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:07,709
350, 351...

380
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,211
3, 2, 1.

381
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,965
- Mama!
- 354, 355...

382
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:19,261
356, 357, 358, 359, 360.

383
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,935
What's SHE doing here?

384
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,953
Camille?

385
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,824
I don't understand.
She absolutely refuses to see you.

386
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,554
- I saw you, lame brains!
- What're you doing?

387
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,972
Nothing.

388
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,091
What's that letter?

389
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,799
A letter from my mother.

390
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,395
Why don't you open it?

391
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,015
I like opening letters,
give it here.

392
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,281
- Wow, an MP3 player!
- Oh, you ARE lucky!

393
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,855
- Is there a letter?
- No.

394
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,612
Sorry, dude.

395
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,256
<i>I'm sorry, she's traumatized and doesn't
want to betray her poor mother.</i>

396
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,752
<i>Yes, possibly.</i>

397
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:26,595
<i>This tragedy must've been
a terrible shock. Be patient.</i>

398
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:31,502
<i>But, I'll give her all the time she needs,
if she just comes to live with me.</i>

399
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,050
<i>Let's first try it for one weekend.</i>

400
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,801
- Ah, disgusting!
- That's mean!

401
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,186
Come on, guys.

402
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,532
What is it, guys?

403
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:51,307
We've just seen Camilles's aunt.
I tell you, up close, she's scary!

404
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,903
Poor Camille. I wouldn't wanna live
with a woman like that.

405
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:59,662
- <i>Fortunately she's not going to.</i>
- She will! Madame Papineau said so.

406
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,290
What?

407
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,358
There's something I don't understand.

408
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,184
Why does she want you to live with her,
if she doesn't like you?

409
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,313
For the money.
If I live with her, she gets loads of cash.

410
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,955
You know, if I have to go,
I'll kill myself.

411
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,949
Or I'll kill her.

412
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,956
I won't let you go.

413
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,468
Mama!

414
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,471
Are you ready? Shall we go?

415
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:04,851
Ohhh!

416
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,613
- Sorry...
- Yeah, they don't like cops, I know.

417
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,893
All right, wait here.
I tell Madame Papineau we're going out.

418
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,377
- It's heavy!
- Really heavy!

419
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,075
Hurry up!

420
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,829
Next time I'm gonna kick their butts!

421
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,757
Your bag is huge.

422
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,752
All right, we're off!

423
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,567
So, nothing new to tell?

424
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,703
Say, that girl, you mentioned.

425
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,196
What's she like?

426
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,748
Not bad.

427
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,416
Just, not bad?

428
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,627
You were more enthusiastic
in your letter.

429
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,530
She has hair.

430
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,923
She has soft hair.

431
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,167
It's long.

432
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,420
And she has eyes that make
your stomach clench.

433
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,502
What colour are they?

434
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,209
- What's this nonsense?
- I wanted Camille to come with us.

435
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:22,479
- You only had to ask!
- Her aunt wouldn't let her!

436
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,107
- We're turning back.
- No!

437
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,432
If we go back I must go live
with my aunt and she'll hit me.

438
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,935
All right, fine.

439
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,851
I still have to call The Home.

440
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,238
Yes?

441
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,570
Yes, very well.

442
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,194
Yes, Monsieur, very well.

443
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,409
I take it up with her aunt.

444
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,593
<i>You all right, Courgette?</i>

445
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,891
That's my house.

00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,887
Wanna go have a look?

447
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,932
<i>What's this?</i>

448
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,271
That's where my mother measured me.

449
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,058
Here I was wearing my riding helmet.

450
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,444
Here is when my father left.

451
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:04,066
And here... I don't remember.

452
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,402
Well, you've grown a lot, huh?

453

00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,462
Careful, Raymond!

Watch your head!

I'd have made a lousy cowboy.

Lemme have that.

Wow, you're too cool!

460
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,960
- We had a pistol at home.
- Like in the Westerns?

461
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,667
My father taught me to shoot.

I mean, with Icare and the policeman.

A courgette, a policeman?
What's all this nonsense?

Look I'm really sorry,
she hid in the car...

A policeman who steals children?
Would you call that a fine man?!

She hid in his car!
He didn't know.

474
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:54,191
She clearly did not want
to spend the weekend with you.

475
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,818
Camille MUST spend the weekend with me!

- Be reasonable, Madame.

Respect Camille's will.

Come off it,
children have no will!

00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,870
What's that thing?

483
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,006
Her lucky charm.

484
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,750
She forgot it.

485
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,549
Oh, her lucky charm!
That changes everything.

486
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:31,187
Yes!

487
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,181
Is that you when you were young?

488
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:41,731
- No, it's my son.
- You have a son?

489
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,689
Yes, but he lives far away.
I don't see him anymore.

490
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:51,115
Sometimes it's children
who abandon their parents.

491
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,656
Shall we continue the tour?

492
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:58,856
Wow!!

493
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,961
- It's a jungle, here!
- I love growing stuff.

494
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,878
Are we sleeping here?

495
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,640
- Is that all right?
- Yes!

496
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,488
Stop it!

497
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:44,706
You know, on the bus...

498
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,214
I wasn't asleep.

499
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,575
Not in bed, yet!

500
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,827
And doing naughty stuff, too!

501
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,572
Come, dearie, we're going home!

502
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,790
Kidnapped by a cop, no less!

503
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,158
<i>Lemme go!</i>

504
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,544
<i>- Ah, it's you! - Let her go!
- I'm gonna report you.</i>

505
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,797
<i>Camille didn't want to go to your house.
I think she has her reasons.</i>

506
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:26,551
<i>I'll file a formal complaint!
Come along. - Don't wanna!</i>

507
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,750
<i>The judge will vindicate me.</i>

508
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:11,213
I don't think it was a good idea.
I'm getting hallucinations.

509
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,215
These fries are talking to me.

510
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:18,144
And what are they telling you?
"Eat me, eat me, Fatso!"

511
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,013
What's going on here?

512
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,523
You're not eating?

513
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,971
Isn't it good?

514
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,612
We're on a hunger strike,
until Camille returns.

515
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,141
Camille will come back.

516
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:35,146
She's coming to see the judge who'll
decide, if her aunt may keep her or not.

517
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,372
<i>Dear Camille,</i>

518
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,501
<i>since you left,
it hasn't been much fun.</i>

519
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:53,756
<i>We tried having a hunger strike,
but it didn't work.</i>

520
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,009
<i>The Beatrice's mother came.</i>

521
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,388
<i>She hid herself in Rosie's arms.</i>

522
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,810
<i>I wanna stay with you.</i>

523
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,432
<i>And Ahmed peed the bed again.</i>

524
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,787
What...

525
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,673
<i>One, two... One, two.</i>

526
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:40,101
<i>This is Simon.
If you can hear me, raise your arm.</i>

527
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,812
<i>No, the other one.</i>

528
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,090
<i>Sorry, I couldn't resist the gag.</i>

529
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,976
<i>Everything's going very badly.</i>

530
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,730
<i>So, listen carefully...</i>

531
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,989
You're just like your mother,
you little slut.

532
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,950
But your nonsense suits my purposes,
you know? - It's Camille!

533
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,327
The judge won't like it.

534
00:50:06,595 --> 00:50:10,064
You've dug your own grave,
you poor excuse for a girl.

535
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,271
Your Honor, I'll give her
an excellent education,

536
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:29,393
a healthy environment, comfort
and above all, love.

537
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,475
I love her like my own daughter.

538
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,025
<i>And Camille and I,
get along so well!</i>

539
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,845
She doesn't seem
wildly enthusiastic.

540
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:44,499
You must understand her.
After the tragedy which struck her,

541
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,894
she must have the impression
of betraying her poor mother.

542
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:56,254
Camille, what do you think?
Would you like to live with your aunt?

543
00:50:56,262 --> 00:51:00,124
You can see, after this incident,
why I have concerns

544
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:04,670
about her safety in this place,
whose lax methods leave much to be desired.

545
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,772
<i>You're just like your mother,
you little slut.</i>

546
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,066
<i>Running off with a boy
at your age, ! For shame!</i>

547
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,935
<i>The foster home is unable
to supervise you.</i>

548
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,778
<i>The judge won't like that.</i>

549
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,904
Gimme that!

550
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,057
Stop, stop!

551
00:51:17,183 --> 00:51:20,461
<i>You've dug your own grave,
you poor excuse for a girl.</i>

552
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,535
- What are you dressed up as, Alice?
- As a pirate.

553
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,788
- What about you?
- As a Mummy.

554
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,141
- What are you dressed up as, Beatrice?
- As Camille.

555
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:46,352
So, Super Zucchini, what are your superpowers?
Do you make vegetables grow fast?

556
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,105
What are you dressed as?
As a lame brain?

557
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,554
Remind me again, who saved you?

558
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,735
He's dressed up as a cop.

559
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:56,309
Careful, Monsieur,
I still don't like cops.

560
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,731
But I'll keep the hat.

561
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,044
- When will you come back?
- Soon.

562
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,088
How soon?

563
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,718
You know, Courgette,
I spoke to the judge.

564
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:31,515
I spoke to him because I'd like to be
your host family...

565
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:34,302
you and Camille.

566
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,600
- Does that mean we're your guests?
- Yes.

567
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,532
And you'll be like our family,
Even though you're all alone?

568
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,650
That's it.

569
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:46,037
You'll come live at the house.

570
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:48,486
My home. I mean YOUR home.

571
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,484
If you want to.

572
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:55,872
- Does Camille know?
- Yes, the judge spoke to her.

573
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,957
What did she say?

574
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:05,014
I don't know. But you have time
to think about it.

575
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,713
You and Camille. Hm?

576
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,259
Voila. See you soon, big guy.

577
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,262
<i>See you soon, Raymond.</i>

578
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:37,038
I want to thank you all,
for saving my life.

579
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,792
Especially Simon. Thank you.

580
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:44,171
I never thought,

581
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:49,058
life could be so cool.
With you it's really cool.

582
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,228
- We'll be together, all our lives!
- Cool!

583
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,106
No, it's not true. We won't
be together, all our lives.

584
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:58,852
Camille and Courgette are splitting.
And with the cop, too!

585
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,085
Hey, Simon.

586
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,589
Simon.

587
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,878
We won't leave, Simon.

588
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:36,094
We wanna stay here.

589
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:41,770
It wouldn't be right to leave.
We're fine here, all together.

590
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,649
Simon...

591
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,736
You must go away.

592
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:04,331
You've no idea how rare it is
for people to adopt kids as old as us.

593
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:09,005
- But...
- No. You must go, for our sake.

594
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,549
Understand?

595
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,449
A cop and a superhero hugging!

596
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,693
Kinda creepy, no?

597
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:37,030
Simon, a bit further left!

598
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,651
Voila.

599
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,913
<i>OK... don't move...</i>

600
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,121
Cut the clowning!

601
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,547
This'll be a proper photo, huh?

602
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:54,301
Watch out, smile...

603
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,092
YEAAAHHH!

604
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:43,225
All right,
Cast-off, Super-Zucchini.

605
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,899
<i>Good bye!</i>

606
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,840
Let's have a race. Last one in,

607
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,585
washes my underpants
till the end of his life.

608
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,803
Allez, go!

609
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,155
That, is the day you became my children.

610
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,546
Like it?

611
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,455
- You all right, Camille?
- Yes.

612
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,700
I dunno why I'm crying.

613
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,034
Sometimes people cry
because they're happy.

614
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:32,038
Right, Raymond?

615
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,460
Yeah...

616
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,523
<i>Dear Simon,</i>

617
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:52,100
<i>you said The Home was a place for those
who had no one to love them.</i>

618
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:57,400
<i>I think you're wrong, because
we haven't forgotten you.</i>

619
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,028
<i>And we haven't forgotten the others.</i>

620
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,684
He opened his eyes.

621
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,936
Hey, he won't let go.

622
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,272
- What's his name, then?
- Antoine.

623
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,567
- Nice name.
- Still, Spiderman was better.

624
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,141
Will he live here with us?

625
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,571
No.

626
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,324
- Unless, you abandon him.
- I WON'T abandon him!

627
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,951
Even... Even if he's ugly?

628
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,703
Even if he smells of poop?

629
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,288
Even if he cries all the time?

630
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,041
- Even if he pees the bed?
- Or lousy at school?

631
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,794
- Even if he's stupid?
- Even if he eats like a pig?

632
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,914
Even if he forgets his name
and his feet stink?

633
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,675
Even if he's unbearable
and screams all the time?

634
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,427
Even if he farts?

635
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,002
- Even if he draws on the walls?
- Even if he wants to be a cop?

636
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,678
- Even if...
- Even if he has a long giraffe neck?

637
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,589
Even if he's a punk?

637
