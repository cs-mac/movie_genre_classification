2
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,710
Taylor have you had breakfast?

3
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,930
- No I'm not hungry.
- Not acceptable!

4
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,470
Gotta go figure out what.

5
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,360
The latest public relations
crisis is today.

6
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,430
Who are you calling a brat?

7
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,530
Private!

8
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,270
What you do online isn't exactly private.

9
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,460
Oh! I almost forgot.

10
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,290
It's your birthday!

11
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,830
Mmm! Don't forget
to get me a present!

12
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,040
I'm gonna tie a string around my finger.

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,240
Good.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,090
Eric!

15
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,730
Don't you dare miss your bus again!

16
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,460
It wasn't my fault last time!

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,760
Hey did you see my bag?
I need my bag.

18
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,730
What you need is a brain.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,020
You can't hit me on my birthday!

20
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,790
Why does everybody think
I should have a party?

21
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,570
Turning 17 doesn't mean anything.

22
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,090
You're crazy. A party means
presents money bling.

23
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,950
If your dad left 3 months ago
you wouldn't want a party.

24
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,210
I don't care about that.

25
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,940
We should do what you did
for your 11th birthday party.

26
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,400
We just got our nails done.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,830
The smell was so bad we all got sick.

28
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,120
I'm pretty sure Julie bryson threw up.

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,750
Did you hear Julie's pregnant?

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,510
What? How would you know?
She moved to Florida.

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,540
Clicksters. Hello!

32
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,180
Oh yeah of course.

33
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,330
...You were upset.

34
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,680
What did you say in health
that got Lindsay so pissed off?

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,590
Nothing! I just said it's
better to wait until you're 18.

36
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,970
Before you go all the way.

37
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,830
She's been doing it since 9th grade.

38
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,990
You basically called her a slut.

39
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,020
- Yeah!
- I did not!

40
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,000
It was a class discussion.
I wasn't talking about her.

41
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,040
My brother wears shoes like that.

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,420
He's 10.

43
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,310
- Don't you love High School?
- So great.

44
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,140
Best years of our lives.

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,590
- Wonderful.
- Amazing.

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,670
Uh definition of "contrarian"?

47
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,980
Me. Definition
of "lazy": You.

48
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,570
Do your own homework.

49
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,020
Look at you!

50
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,410
Taylor you're a "brainiac".
You should know.

51
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,820
Let's have it.

52
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,540
Oh the definition of "lust".

53
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,380
When I look at him my throat swells up.

54
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,330
You do know that Scott
is just a dumb jock right?

55
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,720
- No he's not!
- Ok!

56
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,820
If you were on clicksters.

57
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,500
You could send him a hot metre quiz.

58
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,790
And find out if he likes you.

59
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,920
Stop!
That is so 6th grade.

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,700
Even if I wanted to I couldn't.

61
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,690
My mom stands over
my shoulder the whole time.

62
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,950
She has computer-
monitoring software.

63
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,280
She goes on all the sites I've been on.

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,010
There's no way.
See you later.

65
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,010
- Bye.- Bye.

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,900
Her mom is so backwards.

67
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,450
She can't even have Internet on her phone.

68
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,840
Ah! How does
she live?

69
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,280
On this day in history the
great bard William Shakespeare.

70
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,770
Took his first breath in 1564.

71
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,540
The very first motion picture
was shown in 1896.

72
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,400
Theodore Roosevelt delivered
his man in the arena speech.

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
In 1910.

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,320
Also on this day in history.

75
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,870
Just a little closer to home

76
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,010
Taylor hillridge was born.

77
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,690
Happy Birthday Taylor.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,350
Happy Birthday.

79
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,610
Thanks.

80
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,480
Today's my dad's birthday too.

81
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,040
Cool.

82
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,440
All right class.

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,970
If you would open your books
to unit 11 page 773.

84
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,330
We'll look at a turbulent time.

85
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,760
I swear when he touched my shoulder.

86
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,170
There was like electricity.

87
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,170
Oh please.

88
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,580
No I'm serious!
I felt a tingle.

89
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,490
You think he'd ask me to the spring fling?

90
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,070
- No!
- Why?

91
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,580
Scott ozsik is not the romantic type.

92
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,990
He's a basketball player
on the same team as Charlie.

93
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,760
Ok he's not like Charlie.

94
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,340
He is exactly like Charlie.

95
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,770
And I would know
because I hung out with them.

96
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,180
Yeah once.

97
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,140
Yeah. Charlie hooked
up with me.

98
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,950
He got what he wanted And he never spoke
to me ever again.

99
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,920
I know. I'm sorry.
I know how much that sucked.

100
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,560
He's not like Charlie.

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,020
He is exactly like Charlie.

102
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,800
And it's stupid for you to lose your head.

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,280
Over something silly like this.

104
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,520
Remember it was your dad who left you guys.

105
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,850
For a 25-year-old girl.

106
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,180
If that doesn't tell you
how scummy guys are...

107
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,420
Hey leave my dad out of it ok?

108
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,050
It's so late.

109
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,020
Thank you.

110
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,460
My own computer?

111
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,840
Aw lucky!

112
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,680
Wait hang on.

113
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,510
No there has to be a catch like uh...

114
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,970
I can only use it in the kitchen

115
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,750
I can't use it
after 1:00.

116
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,180
Or you have to share it with me.

117
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,040
No stop.
There's no catch.

118
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,420
It's all yours private.

119
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,460
You can use it wherever
you want if you follow my rules.

120
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,690
No inappropriate sites and no
giving out personal information.

121
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,280
I know the rules but you're
trusting me? Are you feeling ok?

122
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,840
You're funny. I know you think
I'm overprotective.

123
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,480
But the word is "responsible".
Try "suffocating".

124
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,040
I'll let that one slide.

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,190
You wanna be a journalist.

126
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,800
And I want you to write
to your heart's content.

127
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,170
Thank you thank you thank you thank you!

128
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,190
I'm gonna go hook it up.

129
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,020
I'll come help!

130
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,700
You touch you die.

131
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,530
Do you know if your father
called Taylor today?

132
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,440
Don't think so.

133
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,570
She told him she didn't want to
speak to him ever again so...

134
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,640
Ok.

135
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,550
What is my favourite body part?

136
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,460
I have to answer these
questions on my profile?

137
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,390
Just say "eyes".
Everybody says "eyes".

138
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,980
- I said "butt".
- You can get away with it.

139
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,340
Everybody knows you are
all talk and no action.

140
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm putting "eyes".

141
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,330
- Shut up!
- Ah!

142
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,680
Hang on. What kind of
underwear am I wearing now?

143
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,920
Oh my God!
Just say "pink".

144
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,300
Everybody says "pink".
I said "black".

145
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,510
- You don't own black underwear!
- Black?

146
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,550
Seriously what's the point of
answering these questions.

147
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,030
If they're all untrue?

148
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,370
Fine! Tell everybody about
your virginal white undies.

149
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,420
They're not all white!

150
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,510
You're not gonna get
cute guys talking to you.

151
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,040
You'd be surprised how many guys
ask me about my black underwear.

152
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,400
- What?
- Now do you get it?

153
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,560
- Ok all right.
- It makes sense?

154
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,690
- But I'm not putting "black".
- Or "white".

155
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,500
I'll put "blue".
I'll put "blue". That's good.

156
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,590
What was that?
It just beeped.

157
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,920
Friend request.
Click there.

158
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,050
Ok... Oh!

159
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,690
- Ooh!
- It's Scott.

160
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,270
Ok now when you post your answer.

161
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,760
He'll be picturing you in your underwear.

162
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,270
I'm friends with Scott!

163
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,360
Hello?

164
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,260
Yeah thanks for calling.

165
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,970
Listen I'm looking over the numbers.

166
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,390
And what you gave me on line 56...

167
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,820
Hey!

168
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,980
Lindsay commented on our photo.

169
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,590
Oh Lindsay!

170
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,020
Hang on.

171
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,050
Oh that's not very nice.

172
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,040
I don't even know which one
I'm supposed to be.

173
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,990
Lardo or dogface.

174
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,220
I guess I'll be dogface.

175
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,030
What if I wanna be dogface?

176
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,170
Well fine.
Then I'm lardo.

177
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,770
I could always lose a little bit of weight.

178
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,560
You however will always look like a dog.

179
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
Thanks.

180
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,510
Maybe it was a freudian slip.

181
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,050
You know maybe you don't like history.

182
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,640
So you accidently dropped your book.

183
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,840
Get it?

184
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,550
I don't know.
I like history.

185
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,900
Oh me too.

186
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,710
Oh!

187
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,260
It's my favourite.

188
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,680
Caleb's kind of a weird dude huh?

189
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,790
Yeah a little bit.

190
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,880
So I saw you're on clicksters now.

191
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,030
I like it better
than facebook. A lot more raw.

192
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,570
Yeah I noticed.

193
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,780
So maybe I'll talk to you on there tonight?

194
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,290
Uh yeah. You mean like
instant message or something?

195
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,910
There's actually a chat
room just for the school.

196
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,590
I hang out there sometimes when I'm bored.

197
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,570
People talk trash.
It's kind of funny so...

198
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,910
Ha! Ok I'll look for it.

199
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,330
- Cool.
- Ok.

200
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,620
Oh what? Now I'm a loser?

201
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,960
That's true.

202
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,150
What?

203
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,870
Is that clicksters?

204
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,340
Can you make me an account?

205
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,670
- No!
- Please just don't... why?

206
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,050
- No! Get out of my room you little worm!
Go! - Aw! I hate you!

207
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,990
It has been decided.
I am officially lardo.

208
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,910
Thanks to the queen
of mountain High School.

209
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,800
Why does she call herself
lindsayluv online?

210
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,140
It's a contradiction.

211
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,960
Does she have bionic hearing or what?

212
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,070
Oh! Sorry!

213
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,020
Taylor hey.

214
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,910
Um I was actually reading
your page last night and...

215
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,160
- Oh!
- You're a really good writer.

216
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,530
Oh! Well
thank you.

217
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,100
But I do think you
need a few more pictures.

218
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,730
Maybe a bikini shot or something.

219
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,030
Ok I'll think about it.

220
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,070
- See you later.
- Bye.

221
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,120
A bikini shot? Come on!

222
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,420
- He was joking!
- You are so naive!

223
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,790
I can think of at least 2 girls.

224
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,450
He's hooked up with in the past month.

225
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,680
If you count just kissing
then I can think of 3 girls.

226
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,180
Whatever he's popular!

227
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,630
Wait hang on. Don't turn.
Drop me off first.

228
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,670
Why? We always go
to the mall on Friday.

229
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,030
I wanna go home and see
if Scott goes online.

230
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,250
Ok you're now officially pathetic.

231
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,530
I think it's cute.
Let her be in love.

232
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,250
It's not love!

233
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,550
I'm sorry but waiting for a guy to type:

234
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,080
"hey baby.
Send me a bikini shot"

235
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,310
Is not love!

236
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,110
Then what is?
Sleeping with a guy.

237
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,260
The 2nd time you guys go out.

238
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,780
And then wondering why he never
talks to you again?

239
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,460
Get out.

240
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,150
What?

241
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,380
- You can't be serious?
- Out.

242
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,740
Samantha gets so intense.

243
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,730
Yeah I know.
It's fine.

244
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,520
She'll be all right tomorrow.

245
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,510
Besides it was totally worth it.

246
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,810
Scott talked to me for like half an hour.

247
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,040
He sent me 13 messages.

248
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,390
Wow! You think
he likes you?

249
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,160
I don't know.
Probably not.

250
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,200
I know he talks to a lot of girls.

251
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,240
Oh hang on.
Maybe this is him.

252
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,350
Huh! No it's a friend request.

253
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,360
From some guy named James.

254
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,280
Whoa Cheyenne this guy's
like totally gorgeous.

255
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,640
Says he's 17 and he goes to ridgeway.

256
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,250
Oh my cousin goes there.

257
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,430
Whoa listen to this.

258
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:25,030
"read your poem about hiking Mount Maynor.
Was there last summer and felt like the wind was talking to me too"

259
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,300
"heard its voice in my soul
just like you said.

260
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,460
"made me wonder if talking to you
"would be the same kind of thing."

261
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,770
So he has a brain.

262
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,730
Yeah and a soul!

263
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,600
Should I write him back?

264
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,580
Um if you don't I will.

265
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,670
Eric it's your turn.

266
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,570
What you learn today?

267
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,280
Stuff.

268
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,620
Like?

269
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,430
Dad's in California.

270
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,320
You talked to him?

271
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,630
Yeah he called me.

272
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,580
Maybe he called me.

273
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,360
What is it?

274
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,920
Look! Somebody figured
out my password.

275
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,470
And they hacked my profile!

276
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,390
- How do you know? - Look what they wrote.
Look at the status!

277
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,850
"I'm a naughty bad girl.
Someone should spank me."

278
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,460
Someone has a sick sense of humour.

279
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,200
You gotta change your password.

280
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,030
No one should look at this.

281
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,770
It's too late.

282
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,100
- You ok?
- No!

283
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,650
Who do you think changed your status?

284
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,820
Who knew your password?
I don't know! I don't know!

285
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,140
I made Samantha and Cheyenne
look away when I set it up.

286
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,020
I looked around this website.

287
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,080
It's inappropriate for someone your age.

288
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,590
There are no boundaries.

289
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,810
You need to shut down
your profile.- Come on!

290
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,180
Look at you!

291
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,430
You're in tears after one day!

292
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,220
Just shut it down.

293
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,920
It's not worth it.

294
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,940
Honey it's not worth it.

295
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,070
Hello?

296
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,220
Hey.

297
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,520
Hey are you still in a "pissy" mood?

298
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,690
Shut up and come over.

299
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,960
You can put what happened
in your status right?

300
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,640
And then you change your password.
Not to something easy like your birthday.

301
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,540
It wasn't my birthday before.

302
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,270
Or like anything anyone could've guessed.

303
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,000
God all those things
people were saying about me.

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,250
How am I gonna face going
to school on Monday?

305
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,780
Don't be a wuss.

306
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,950
You can't take that stuff seriously.

307
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,930
Besides nobody's even gonna
remember it by Monday.

308
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,200
Hey one good thing
happened on clicksters today.

309
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,370
I talked to this guy named James.

310
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,670
What? You should've seen
what he wrote me.

311
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,950
It was like really smart and funny.

312
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,600
Oh! Let's not
talk about boys.

313
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,710
We can rent a movie you can sleep over.

314
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,450
Ok fine.

315
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,940
Hello!

316
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,690
Good morning.

317
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,770
What's going on?

318
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,300
Eric.

319
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,210
Tell her.

320
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,410
Me and my friend Cooper were the ones
that Changed the status on your profile.

321
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,160
What?

322
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,950
- You used the old Cat's name for your password.
- I'm gonna kill you!

323
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,700
Taylor come back here.

324
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,060
- I can't believe he did that to me!
- Taylor!

325
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,390
Look it I am really upset with him too.

326
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,230
I've grounded him for a month.

327
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,210
But I'm really upset with you too.

328
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,790
- What did I do? - I looked to see
if you took down your profile.

329
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,180
I never said I'd do that.

330
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,760
Well on your page you posted a
comment And called someone a bitch.

331
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,640
Whoa! Now you're
spying on me?

332
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,810
When you put something online
it's no longer private.

333
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,040
Everyone can see it and you know my rule.

334
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,640
You can't use the Internet to be
insulting or call anyone names.

335
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,050
- What about what they called me?
- I know it's terrible.

336
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,470
But that's no excuse to be ugly
to someone online or anywhere.

337
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,630
Fine. I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

338
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,610
- To make sure you won't do it again I'm
taking away your laptop. - Oh come on.

339
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,660
Going on the Internet Means
responsibility and consequences.

340
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,860
You'll get it back in 3 days.

341
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,260
Wonderful.

342
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,540
Eric!

343
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,530
Taylor behave yourself!

344
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,690
I can't believe your own
brother did that to you.

345
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,690
It's disgusting. It's gross.
I'm never going to forgive him.

346
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,300
"I'm not going to your graduation.

347
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,340
"I'm not going to your wedding.

348
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,400
"I might go to your funeral."

349
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,310
Damn! Tayhill actually
came to school today.

350
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,220
I owe you 5 bucks.

351
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,060
What's your problem?

352
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,970
Oh I don't have a problem.

353
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,590
You do little miss
I'd-never-go-all-the-way.

354
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,090
Such a hypocrite.

355
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,900
How many guys did you
hook up with this weekend?

356
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,720
Ten? Twenty?

357
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,790
- You should have
a drive-thru.

358
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,410
You said everyone was
gonna forget it by Monday.

359
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,600
- Ok people have been posting really stupid
stuff On your page all weekend. - What?

360
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,600
They're saying you sleep around.

361
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,130
Why didn't you tell me?

362
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,130
Well Samantha didn't want
to freak you out and...

363
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,540
I honestly thought it would
die down by now.

364
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,050
I have to see. Give me your phone.
I have to see what's going on.

365
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,420
You don't have to see it right now.

366
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,500
Yeah I have to see it right now.
If everyone's seen it then Scott has seen it.

367
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,390
Please can I use your phone?
No I'm not gonna give you my phone.

368
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,400
I saw what people were
saying about you online.

369
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,640
I don't know why they have to do that.

370
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,580
It sucks.

371
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,150
How would you know?

372
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,830
You serious?

373
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,950
You've been called
a slut and a whore? Really?

374
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,690
I guess you've never been on my page.

375
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,890
There's fairy...

376
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,410
Fruit homo.

377
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,370
Too gay to live.

378
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,140
Yeah but I mean it's not
really the same thing.

379
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,870
I mean you really are gay.

380
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,040
What they're saying about me isn't true.

381
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,900
You really don't get how messed up it is.

382
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,150
I sit behind you
in algebra. You smell weird.

383
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,030
That's what skanks smell like.

384
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,200
What like puke?

385
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,750
Jealous much?
She's smarter than you.

386
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,410
"then why doesn't she know
she's a loser?"

387
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,430
And then James wrote: "haters suck.
The girl is more cool than you."

388
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,440
He defended me.

389
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,260
He is a gentleman.

390
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,070
Ah I'm gonna write him
back And say thank you.

391
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,790
Ask him if he knows my cousin.

392
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,020
You all finished?

393
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,830
Then back to your room.

394
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,860
- You're gonna keep me
a prisoner for a month?- Yeah she is.

395
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,960
Taylor!

396
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,410
Honey you really need to go to your room.

397
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,850
Dad would've never let you ground
me For something this stupid!

398
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,400
I get my laptop back tomorrow right?

399
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,140
Yeah. You gonna take
your profile down?

400
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,960
Are you saying I have no choice?

401
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,770
No I'm saying I'm trusting
you to make the right choice.

402
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,110
Well who says that's the right choice?

403
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,640
You know everyone at
my school is on that site.

404
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,080
I was just having fun.

405
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,980
It was Eric who messed it all up for me.

406
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,370
You know I wish
you wouldn't fake-trust me.

407
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,780
I wish you would just actually do it.

408
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,100
It's the seedy underbelly.

409
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,440
Oh my God!

410
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,390
- I know! Look at her!
- Ah!

411
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,560
I'm not gonna let it bother me.

412
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,350
You know I don't care what they think.

413
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,020
That's what James told her.

414
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,840
I let her borrow my phone.

415
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,530
Look what he said.

416
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,800
"even though we've never met
I feel like I know you.

417
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,820
"you make me melt."

418
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,990
Is this guy for real?

419
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,900
I can't believe
I'm actually encouraging this.

420
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,720
Yeah why are you encouraging this?

421
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,850
For you to see the difference Between
a guy that is genuinely nice.

422
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,210
And a guy that just wants
to hook up with you.

423
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,870
You don't like Scott anymore?

424
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,320
Like that was ever gonna happen.

425
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,430
Why not?
Thirteen messages.

426
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,530
That's a lot of messages.

427
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,050
But Scott was this fantasy guy.

428
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,110
That might like me if I was different.

429
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,980
But James likes me for who I am.

430
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,970
Now I just need my computer back.

431
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,490
So I can write him back.

432
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,230
- That sounds like love.
- It might be.

433
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,430
Oh I need ketchup.
Hang on.

434
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,110
- Oh! Sorry.
- Sorry.

435
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,340
I was just going to get ketchup.

436
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,890
Oh me too.

437
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,320
I was actually gonna come
look for you after lunch.

438
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,190
- You were? - Yeah I heard
somebody hacked your profile.

439
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,630
It happened to me once.
Sucked really bad.

440
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,880
My brother did it.
That's what's even worse.

441
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,790
- Oh man your brother? Really?
- Yeah.

442
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,960
Should I have a chat with him?
Straighten him out?

443
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,430
Please yes.

444
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,410
No but seriously I was gonna come find you.

445
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,210
I wanted to see if you wanna go To
the spring fling dance with me.

446
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,290
You're asking me to the dance?

447
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,360
If you're already going with
someone That's totally cool.

448
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,190
Oh no! I mean yes!

449
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,250
I mean no I'm not going with anyone.

450
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,160
And yes I will go with you.

451
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,960
Yeah?

452
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,300
- Yeah.
- Ok cool.

453
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,200
Why don't you send me a message
give me your number.

454
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,610
Ok sure. Ok.

455
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,960
Why did you tell him
you weren't going with anyone?

456
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,430
The 3 of us were gonna go together.

457
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,170
Why can't you be happy for her?

458
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,740
I'd be happy for you if
someone you liked asked you.

459
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,590
A minute ago you liked James.

460
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,540
I don't know if I would like him in real life.
I've never met him.

461
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,680
- Ketchup?
- Oh yeah. Thank you.

462
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,390
Ketchup?

463
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,670
You wanna know about Scott?

464
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,710
Charlie told him about
some stuff he and I did.

465
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,450
And you know what Scott did?

466
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,590
He laughed.

467
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,450
You're gonna get hurt Taylor.

468
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,760
I mean just 'cause you got
dumped Doesn't mean I will.

469

Why are you so excited?

477
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,170
Scott ozsik asked me to the spring fling.

478
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,770
That's wonderful sweetheart.

479
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,620
So can I have my laptop back now?

480
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,850

What are you guys doing here?

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,170
Cheyenne made me drive her.

483
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,090
You haven't seen it yet?

484
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,990
- No. What?
- Your wall.

485
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,440
No I just got my computer back.
What did Lindsay post more stuff?

486
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,370
Um not Lindsay.

487
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,300
That James guy you thought was so nice.

488
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,050
He's saying he slept with you...

489
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,850
That you gave him an std.

490
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,960
No big surprises she's nasty!

491
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,720
Can smell clap on her

492
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,190
bet you big money has herpes too.

493
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,480
No wonder she reeks.

494
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,020
She's always made me want to throw up.

495
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,440
She's a loser.

496
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,170
I sit behind you in
algebra. You smell weird.

497
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,490
- The clap.
- Skanky whore.

498
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,840
Gross! Don't breathe
around her.

499
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,720
You'll get infected.

500
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,400
I don't get it

501
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,450
God why would he say that he slept
with me Or got an std from me?

502
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,190
I never even met him!

503
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,710
I'm so sorry.

504
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,440
I knew it.

505
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,390
I told my cousin to look at James's profile.
And see if she recognized him.

506
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,080
She says there's no such guy at ridgeway.

507
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,800
Maybe she's just never met him.

508
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,760
There's 300 people there.

509
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,280
She'd recognize him if he went there.

510
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,950
What so he's fake?

511
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,800
Well he's full of crap so yeah he's fake.

512
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,700
I bet you 100 bucks someone
just put up that fake profile.

513
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,310
Oh Lindsay!

514
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,320
Yeah Lindsay would totally
do something like that.

515
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,020
Oh God! All the stuff
that I told him.

516
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,380
I told him my dad cheated on my mom!

517
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,120
Like all kinds of personal stuff.

518
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,270
What if he posts it?

519
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,890
Almost dinner.
Time to go soon girls ok?

520
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,120
Thanks.

521
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,160
No. No I'm not
gonna tell her.

522
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,920
No I just got my laptop back.

523
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,630
Wanna try?

524
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,400
No I might look slutty.

525
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,710
Is that why you're wearing
all those baggy clothes?

526
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,940
Did you see what people were
saying about me last night?

527
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,730
You're not even in the
neighbourhood of being a slut.

528
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,300
And your status says
that you never slept with James.

529
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,500
I don't understand what I did wrong.

530
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,700
Should've brought the disinfectant.

531
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,180
Don't wanna use these sinks
after the skank patrol.

532
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,510
Sick.

533
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,780
Calling me a skank now too?

534
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,930
Yeah I know.
It sucks.

535
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,970
I've never been called a name at school.

536
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,060
You know what they say.
Sticks and stones may break your bones...

537
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,110
Don't make a joke about this.
Don't you dare!

538
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,140
Just stop following me ok?

539
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,980
She blames me for what Lindsay said?

540
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,720
I'll go talk to her.

541
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,790
Scott hey.

542
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,370
Hey what's up?

543
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,920
Uh nothing.

544
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,800
Look I know that a lot of people
Are saying stuff about me online.

545
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,810
This stuff's totally not true.

546
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,710
And I guess I just want to make
sure... - It's not a big deal.

547
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,500
Well it kind of is...

548
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's really gross stuff and...

549
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,170
Look I haven't slept with
anybody or anything and...

550
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,060
I'll see you in history.

551
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,990
You can come in you know.

552
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,340
Just let me ask you one thing.

553
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,940
Are you still my friend?

554
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,640
Yeah I guess.

555
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,320
What does that mean? My friend
everywhere except school?

556
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,280
Look I don't know what you expect.

557
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,590
None of this is my fault.

558
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,680
Samantha's standing by me.
Why can't you?

559
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,630
Why can't you not flirt
with people you don't know?

560
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,610
You didn't have to talk to that James guy.

561
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,750
You think all this is my fault?

562
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,730
You called Lindsay a bitch online.

563
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,350
Of course she was gonna come after you.

564
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,840
I made spaghetti for dinner
if you'd like some.

565
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,340
Hello.

566
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,070
Hi kris? This is Darren
mortenson Cheyenne's father.

567
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,790
Oh hi Darren.
How have you been?

568
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,800
Kris I don't know...

569
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,940
Are you aware of what's
been happening with Taylor?

570
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,960
Show me your clicksters page now!

571
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,950
Why didn't you shut this down
when I asked you to?

572
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,920
And why would you subject yourself to this?

573
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,100
Shut it down Taylor.
You have no choice anymore.

574
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,410
Oh look mom!
A new comment!

575
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,130
I'm so popular!

576
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,970
No this one's from lindsayluv.
She's my favourite.

577
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,920
Yeah she says that James told her

578
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,060
I took all my clothes off for 5 bucks.

579
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,080
Did you change your mind
about going to school?

580
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,310
You said I could have one day to stay home.

581
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,790
I just don't want you To get in the
habit of avoiding your problems.

582
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,680
Sometimes the best thing is to face
things head on Don't you think?

583
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,240
Maybe you should just walk into your school
With your head high and tell those kids.

584
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,360
They shouldn't believe everything
they see On the Internet.

585
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,370
That's gonna be a big help.

586
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,260
I'm gonna stop by your school
and tell your principal.

587
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,220
Great.

588
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,300
Hi you've reached Brett.

589
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,990
I can't get to the phone right now.

590
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,860
Please leave a message.

591
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,860
Hey dad.
It's me Taylor.

592
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,400
I know you probably didn't pick up Because
you think I'm still mad at you but um...

593
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,950
Ok I take back what I said About
never wanting to speak to you again.

594
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,710
Uh... You...

595
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:51,070
I just feel so alone right now And I
don't know if you care or not but um...

596
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,790
Just call me back.

597
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,400
You're preaching to the choir.

598
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,420
I know bullying over
the Internet is a problem.

599
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,500
It's given me a headache.

600
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,100
I still can't figure out
what to do about it.

601
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,990
Well why wouldn't you treat a
cyberbully like any other bully?

602
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,070
Well I can't control the Internet Or what
students do on their own computers at home.

603
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,720
And this kind of bullying.

604
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,870
Well it happens using anonymous user names.

605
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,930
You can't tell who's who
and who started what.

606
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,040
But the kids know who's who.
They can tell you.

607
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,500
Well maybe but unless
I can get the school board.

608
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,060
To give me some guidelines That
allows me to compel them to do so...

609
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,200
Well you must have some kind of policy.

610
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:44,590
A vague one created by insurance companies
To protect the school from liability.

611
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,300
Half the time I don't know
where I stand legally.

612
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,930
I keep asking the school board
to give me some policies.

613
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,460
That has some teeth that I can use
To bite down on these kids but...

614
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,440
Hey.

615
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,170
Look I promised my mom I wouldn't
go on clicksters on my computer.

616
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,680
Can I use yours?

617
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,750
Sure.

618
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,390
Now they're saying I missed
school because I'm pregnant.

619
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,540
And I'm some kind of prostitute.

620
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,340
- Nobody believes that stuff.
- Maybe Cheyenne was right. I was asking for it.

621
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,950
Cheyenne's stupid.

622
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,250
No I told all that personal stuff To James.

623
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,770
Ha! I didn't
even know him.

624
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,800
Taylor this is really hard...

625
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,340
You know Scott reads that stuff.

626
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,260
I mean what if he believes it?
What if he thinks I'm pregnant?

627
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,110
Wait that's what you're
worried about right now? Scott?

628
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,730
Yeah! Yeah I'm
worried about Scott.

629
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,140
Who cares what he thinks Taylor?

630
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,440
Where has Scott been?
Nowhere!

631
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,580
You even said yourself
he's been ignoring you!

632
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,290
Now all of a sudden
you care what he thinks?

633
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,010
Hey stop yelling at me!

634
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,450
I can't take it if you're against me too.

635
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,420
I'm sorry.

636
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,210
I'm so sorry Taylor.

637
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,420
None of this should've happened.

638
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,640
Maybe we should forget school today.

639
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,450
You wanna ditch?
I'll ditch with you?

640
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,160
No I wanna talk to Scott.

641
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,280
Of course.

642
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,080
Look you should just get Scott
to give you a ride home too.

643
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,580
Because I'm done trying to be your friend.

644
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,180
Have a nice life Taylor.

645
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,340
Hey Scott.

646
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,080
Hey.

647
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,190
Hey I know I haven't
talked to you in a while.

648
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,850
Um I was just wondering.

649
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,370
If we were still going
to the dance tonight?

650
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,710
Um listen Taylor.

651
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,480
My mom pissed me off last night And
said I have to go with marnie fox.

652
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,750
Her mom's best friends with my mom and...

653
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,410
Yeah.

654
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,430
So you're taking marnie?

655
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,170
I'm sorry. It's not
exactly my choice but...

656
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,930
I don't know what else to do.

657
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,920
Ok.

658
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,180
Just...

659
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,000
Oh! She's crying.

660
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,430
She must've seen the video.

661
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,520
Everyone's seen it.

662
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,370
500 views last time I checked.

663
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,260
You guys have all seen it right?

664
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,790
Isn't it hysterical?

665
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,840
What video?

666
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,690
Just wait till you see it.

667
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,540
I'm Taylor hillridge.
Wanna have a good time?

668
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,360
5 bucks all it takes!

669
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,140
You smell like a bit of a sewer.

670
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,650
You ever take shower?

671
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,240
How about 2 bucks...
Or $1? 50 cents?

672
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,930
How about I pay you to show me a good time?

673
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,710
Ew! Gross!

674
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,850
I act like I'm the most Holy
And pure thing at school.

675
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:54,400
But I'm really The dirtiest little whore.

676
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,500
I'm the real Taylor hillridge.

677
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,630
And I don't know why
everybody hates me so much!

678
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,920
But maybe I do.

679
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,960
Because now I hate me too.

680
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,250
And right now

681
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,590
I really don't see the reason for trying...

682
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,830
...Or for talking.

683
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,490
Or for breathing.

684
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,350
I'm just done.

685
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,180
So that's it I guess.

686
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,750
Bye.

687
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,260
Pick up the phone Taylor.

688
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,190
Pick up the phone Taylor!

689
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,780
Taylor?

690
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,170
This is kris.

691
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,630
It's Samantha. Something's
wrong with Taylor.

692
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,570
She posted a video online.
Now she's not answering the phone.

693
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,070
And I'm really freaking out.

694
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,080
Slow down.
I can't understand you.

695
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,220
I think she's trying to kill herself.

696
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,570
Oh my God!

697
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,100
Oh my God!

698
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,410
Taylor?

699
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,190
Taylor?

700
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,930
Where's Taylor?

701
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,680
How should I know?
I'm grounded.

702
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,290
Taylor?

703
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,880
Taylor? Taylor!

704
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:40,970
Taylor?

705
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,750
Taylor?

706
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,920
I can't get the cap off!

707
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,550
No!

708
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,130
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

709
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,370
Taylor?

710
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,330
Taylor let go!

711
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,130
What did you do?

712
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,910
Sit down sit down
sit down. Back up.

713
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,400
It's ok.

714
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,630
I got you.

715
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,700
Baby it's ok.

716
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,660
Please.

717
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,880
I wanna die. No!

718
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,970
I wanna die!

719
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,070
You're awake. You ok?

720
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,460
Yeah. I feel funny.

721
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,350
I'm sleepy.

722
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,160
That's the sedative.
It's starting to wear off.

723
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,490
Hey Sammi.

724
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,930
I'm ok.

725
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,640
I don't understand how this happened.

726
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,330
Did she tell you she was so depressed?

727
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,610
Uh I don't know. Maybe.

728
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:47,560
Did this happen because
this James kid turned on her?

729
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,140
Do you know who he is?

730
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,290
Taylor found out that he wasn't real.

731
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,950
What does that mean?

732
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:02,940
Someone posed as James to torture her?

733
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,730
Um look I gotta go.

734
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,470
My mom's gonna be worried.

735
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,980
Just have Taylor call me whenever.

736
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:35,220
I've talked to Taylor and
I'd like to keep her overnight.

737
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,030
Make sure she's stable.

738
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:40,120
You can take her home in the morning But
you'll have to keep a sharp eye on her.

739
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,250
I'm keeping her out of
school for the next week.

740
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,730
And I'm taking a week off of work.

741
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,400
Good. If she starts talking about
Harming herself again call me.

742
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,320
This is an appointment card For her
next one-one-one session with me.

743
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,210
And this is a teen support group I run.

744
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,490
It's twice a week.

745
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:01,610
We talk about assertiveness
bullying other things.

746
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,140
I think it might help her.

747
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:07,660
And finally a prescription
for a mild tranquilizer.

748
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,100
One tablet every 6 hours
for the next few days.

749
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,460
Or until you feel her mood has evened out.

750
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,040
It'll make her want to sleep
but that's a good thing.

751
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,900
I'm doing such a great job on my own.

752
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,590
Taylor mentioned you were divorced.

753
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,610
I'm sure that's a factor
But being bullied online.

754
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,370
That can push a kid over the edge.

755
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,780
It's like a group assault very traumatic.

756
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,010
Anyone with a computer can see it.

757
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,320
It's always there 24/7.

758
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,160
Makes the victim feel even more trapped.

759
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,010
Unable to escape from it.

760
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,690
I almost lost her.

761
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,880
Check in on Taylor every 10 minutes.

762
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,820
And call me if she wakes up.

763
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,900
Ok.

764
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,710
Eric I'm serious.

765
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,050
I didn't un-ground you So that you
could play video games all day.

766
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,300
Keep an eye on your sister.

767
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,660
I don't want it to happen to her either.

768
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,520
Thank you.
I'll be back in an hour.

769
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,260
Oh and your dad might call.
He left a message on Taylor's cell.

770
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,000
Just don't say anything.

771
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,930
I haven't figured out
what I'm gonna tell him.

772
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,110
Ok.

773
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,090
Where you going?

774
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,980
I'm gonna find out who that James is.

775
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,210
You're such an ass Scott.

776
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,320
Such an ass.

777
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,580
Thank you for letting me come over.

778
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,150
I'm really sorry Taylor's
having such a hard time.

779
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,860
You know the way they're
all ganging up on her.

780
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,610
It's pretty rough stuff.

781
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,900
It's gone.

782
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,810
James's profile it was here yesterday.

783
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,690
And now it's deleted.

784
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,380
I should've printed it out
when I had the chance.

785
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,750
Does Taylor hate me?

786
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,820
Of course not Cheyenne.

787
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:44,070
Do you think that this
James person could be a fake?

788
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,690
Well his profile says that he
goes to ridgeway and he doesn't.

789
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,370
Do you have any idea who
could've created this profile?

790
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:07,740
Can I help you?

791
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,520
Uh Mr. Fordyce.

792
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,450
Lindsay's father?

793
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:12,360
Yes I am.
What's this about?

794
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,690
Our daughters go to school together.

795
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,700
And I was wondering if I could
speak to you and your wife.

796
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,460
About some things that have been happening.

797
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,390
My wife passed away a few years ago.

798
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:22,570
So you'll have to deal with me.

799
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,110
I heard my name.

800
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,570
I'm Taylor's mother
and I was just wondering.

801
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,000
If you created a fake profile online.

802
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,390
- What? No!
- Lindsay go back inside.

803
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:35,780
You and your friends have been
harassing my daughter for weeks.

804
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:40,420
My daughter tried to commit suicide
Because your daughter was bullying her.

805
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,930
You should know you're
speaking with an attorney.

806
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,560
Before you slander my daughter.

807
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,890
It's not slander.
It's fact.

808
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:49,480
I have posts from lindsayluv
your daughter mocking Taylor.

809
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,570
If my daughter expressed
her opinion about anything...

810
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,250
Demeaning insulting opinions.

811
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:57,720
That's her right at least
according to the constitution.

812
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,930
Excuse me? You're going
to defend her?

813
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,410
It's called freedom of speech.

814
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,000
It's the first amendment.

815
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,830
You might want to give it a read.

816
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,360
Why are you staring at me?

817
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,270
Mom said I have to call her
when you wake up.

818
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,340
No you don't have to call her.

819
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,600
But you do have to get me
that water over there.

820
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,700
Were you really gonna do it?

821
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,560
I would've been mad if you did.

822
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,910
No you would've loved being an only child.

823
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,390
No I wouldn't!

824
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,620
If you hadn't put that video up

825
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,590
I could've been the one finding you all...

826
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,470
Dead in the bathroom you know?

827
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,210
God I bet they're saying
all kinds of things about me.

828
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,840
Eric go get the laptop. I have
to see what they're saying.

829
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,200
Fine I'll get it.

830
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,290
No it's fine.
I got it I got it.

831
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,120
Do you really think that's a good idea?

832
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,050
I don't know why you're making me do this.

833
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,480
This isn't a punishment Taylor.

834
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,900
It's a support group a place to help you
talk about What you've been through.

835
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,640
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Then don't talk about it. Just go and listen.

836
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,580
We can't pretend that this didn't happen!

837
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,360
It happened and you need help!

838
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,320
And there's nothing wrong
with asking for help!

839
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:59,200
It's really hard to see you
in this much pain.

840
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,940
And I am scared that
you're gonna try this again!

841
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,760
You've put so much into your life.

842
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,370
Your life is so precious.

843
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,730
Please.

844
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,660
Fine. Ok I'm going.

845
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,960
Before we had to stop unfortunately.

846
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,870
We interrupted your story Kate.
Then we're gonna talk...

847
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,630
Oh Taylor!

848
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,200
Glad you could make it.

849
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,930
Come sit down.

850
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:16,640
Uh...

851
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:19,750
Ok.

852
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,290
Awkward.

853
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,140
I printed out what
these kids are saying to her.

854
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,580
They're calling her terrible
names and saying she has stds.

855
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,080
Has she been physically threatened?

856
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,660
I can do something about that.

857
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:39,710
They're calling her dirty And saying
she's sleeping with boys for money.

858
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,520
Isn't that harassment?
If they said it to her face yes.

859
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,930
But online there's no law
against that in this state.

860
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:49,470
Other States have laws that are particular
To the Internet but not this one.

861
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,530
How can that be?
I'm trying to get help.

862
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,870
I've gone to the school school board And door
after door keeps getting slammed in my face.

863
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,480
It's not that I don't want to help you.

864
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,960
But unless a law is broken...

865
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,620
I can only enforce the laws
I can't write them.

866
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,490
In elementary school it was like:

867
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:09,130
"hey there goes jelly donut"
you know stuff like that.

868
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,780
And it sucked right?

869
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,170
But at least I could go home
to get some peace.

870
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:17,280
Now it's like I can't even post
pictures on my own profile

871
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,990
'cause people are gonna be telling me.

872
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:23,510
How fat or disgusting I am.

873
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,620
This stuff follows me home.

874
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,060
I hate that.

875
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:37,090
But the worst is when people
resend stuff you said to them.

876
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,170
There was this guy I liked.

877
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,530
I thought he liked me.

878
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,300
He really didn't.

879
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:58,400
But I told him personal stuff and...

880
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,640
And he sent it to a bunch of people.

881
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,450
And now at school
there's this bunch of guys.

882
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:09,300
And they act out the stuff
I said right in front of me.

883
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:12,580
They call it
the gay-boy show.

884
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,440
No wait.
That's not the worst.

885
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,680
You were right.
The worst is when it goes home with you.

886
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,520
And they pile on and pile on.

887
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,780
And you think: "I don't even
know who that person is.

888
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,020
"how can he say that
he despises that I exist?"

889
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,120
Caleb I'm really sorry.

890
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,430
You told me people were picking on you And I
didn't say anything and I'm really sorry.

891
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,380
You should post crap about those guys too.

892
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,570
You know that's what I'd do.

893
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:55,460
It's not about getting mad.
It's getting even.

894
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,600
Well that's one option.
Become the bully yourself.

895
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:02,740
Right? How many of you
have ever decided to get even.

896
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:07,280
Posted mean comments online About
someone you felt was being mean to you.

897
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,010
No one else?

898
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,100
You never called someone a name online.

899
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,420
Or said they were stupid or ugly?

900
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:31,680
I called Lindsay fordyce a bitch.

901
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,310
Thank you.

902
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:53,490
Scott!
Hey.

903
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:57,230
You must be feeling really
happy with yourself.

904
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,100
Is your ego all puffed up and feeling good?

905
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,200
Excuse me?

906
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,210
I'm Taylor's best friend.

907
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:07,580
I was sitting there when you
invited her to the spring fling.

908
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,310
So you're gonna blame me Because she
had some sort of mondo meltdown?

909
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,370
Like you even care about her!

910
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,110
Wait. Wait.

911
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:18,390
So is she doing ok?

912
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:21,360
- Give me a break Scott!
- I'm serious. I wanna know.

913
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,770
I actually really did like her.

914
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,480
- Right.
- You don't give a crap do you?

915
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:29,740
You just think I'm an ass which...

916
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,280
...Is probably true.

917
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,840
So why don't you tell me huh?

918
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:38,800
What's it like to be so perfect That you
don't have to feel bad about anything.

919
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,300
- Yeah I got your message.
- Oh that's good.

920
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:56,270
I saved the one where you said you started
To call like 50 times on my birthday.

921
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:57,910
I should've just called.

922
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:59,910
You know I care
about you a lot.- Yeah.

923
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:01,870
Yeah I know you care.

924
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:03,730
I do really.

925
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,000
Well I'll see you in a few weeks then.

926
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,750
Ok honey.

927
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,940
Ok. Hey dad wait.

928
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:15,950
Thanks for calling.

929
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:17,510
I'm really glad I did.

930
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,420
Bye.
Bye.

931
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,760
Here's your pill.

932
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,510
Do I have to take it?

933
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,890
You don't want it?

934
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:41,280
I don't know. They make me so sleepy.
I kind of want to wake up.

935
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:44,700
Dr. Rilke said you can stop
when you feel better.

936
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,240
You've been so nice to me.

937
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:52,300
I never used to think you were nice.

938
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,100
What?

939
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,190
I don't know.
I guess I just always thought.

940
01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:01,310
You were so strict and
overprotective and mean.

941
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:03,420
And here I thought you adored me.

942
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,680
Well that too.

943
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,740
You're in a funny mood.

944
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,640
I don't know. I just
felt so alone you know?

945
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:19,560
When all those people started saying
stuff about me I felt like such a freak.

946
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,550
Like I was the only one.

947
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:25,080
Like there had to be something
wrong with me For them to do that.

948
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,950
But today I found out this
happens to a lot of people.

949
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,160
Like these really normal people.

950
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,480
I don't know.
I wish I'd known that.

951
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,600
I wish I'd known you weren't against me.

952
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,830
Oh Taylor!

953
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,130
I should've talked to you.
I don't know why I didn't.

954
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,340
I'm sorry.
I should've talked to you.

955
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,620
I made it hard to talk to me.

956
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,860
I was so busy telling you what to do
That I wasn't listening to how you felt.

957
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:01,230
I'm sorry you thought
that I was against you.

958
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,270
I would never be against you.

959
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,390
I know.

960
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,610
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

961
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,910
I'm glad I'm not dead.

962
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,170
Me too.

963
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:20,910
Was that my phone?

964
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,420
Oh it's in my purse.

965
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,850
Oh it's Samantha.

966
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:32,960
Ok.

967
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,140
Thanks.

968
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,630
Hey!

969
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,290
Come inside.

970
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,130
I can't.

971
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:57,510
Why not?

972
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:00,870
Because you're gonna hate me
after I tell you this.

973
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,660
You're scaring me.

974
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,050
I don't know how to tell you
this So I'm just gonna say it.

975
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,930
I'm the one who created
the James profile...

976
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,640
I pretended to be him.
I talked to you.

977
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,930
Told everybody you gave him an std.

978
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,980
I know you're lying.

979
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:30,820
You wouldn't do that.

980
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,330
I did.

981
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,170
I really wish I hadn't but I did.

982
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,660
I'm sorry.

983
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,920
I'm really sorry Taylor.

984
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,720
Samantha?

985
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,930
What is it?
What's going on?

986
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,360
I did something really bad mom.

987
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,230
And worse...

988
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,220
Now everybody knows.

989
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,800
Yeah I mean I guess I'm feeling better
But I haven't been going to school.

990
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,460
And I know I'll eventually have
to go back and face everyone.

991
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:02,940
And that scares me.

992
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,730
Hey if I can do it you can do it.

993
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:08,170
But I feel like I can't go
back until I go online.

994
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,250
And I don't know if I can handle that.

995
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,530
I think it's gonna be bad.

996
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,320
It's ok.

997
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:20,190
Hon...

998
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:22,750
It is gonna get better ok?

999
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,280
I'm fine.
Thank you.

1000
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,640
Ok.

1001
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:03,770
This seems like a good time to
talk about how to handle it.

1002
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,330
When you run into unpleasant
comments about you online.

1003
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:09,890
You mean besides getting
even going all bully on them?

1004
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:12,900
Which only adds fuel to the
fire makes everything worse.

1005
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:39,590
I don't know what to do When I read that stuff.
I just fall apart.

1006
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:42,050
It's fine to fall apart For a little while.

1007
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:44,510
It's fine to acknowledge that it hurts.

1008
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:47,340
But there are things that
you can do that you should do.

1009
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,950
- Like print out everything?
- Yes.

1010
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,790
You see something negative
about you print it out.

1011
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:54,950
Save the evidence.
What else?

1012
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:58,160
Block 'em. You know
block the sender.

1013
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,430
You know you don't wanna see What
crap they're saying about you.

1014
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,020
Took me for damn ever to figure that out.

1015
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:06,720
God I never thought of that.

1016
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,000
Now there's one more thing you can do.

1017
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,210
Probably the most important thing.

1018
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,360
Anyone?

1019
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,820
Speak up man.
Tell someone.

1020
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,880
- Exactly.
- Tell who? Your mom?

1021
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,070
My mom kind of knew although
I did kind of hide it from her.

1022
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:32,980
Sure start with your parents
but don't stop there.

1023
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:37,170
Your favourite teacher
your principal. I don't know.

1024
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:40,080
You can report it to The bully's
Internet service provider.

1025
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,040
Sometimes they'll shut down
the bully's account.

1026
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,100
You're kidding.

1027
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,580
Cyberbullies keep going.

1028
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:47,640
Because they think no one
will do anything about it.

1029
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,750
But if you call attention to it.

1030
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,380
There's a chance you can stop it
from spiralling out of control.

1031
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,270
- But you can't totally stop it.
- Don't know unless you try.

1032
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,340
Don't hide behind your fear.

1033
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,200
Do what it takes to stand up for yourself.

1034
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,750
And for each other.

1035
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:11,640
I've looked into it and most
States have passed laws.

1036
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,340
Against harassment on the Internet.

1037
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:16,080
Remember Tina meier?
Her daughter committed suicide.

1038
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,790
I remember that.
How tragic. Tragic.

1039
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,970
After that Missouri passed a law.

1040
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,560
I mean do we have to wait
for somebody to die first?

1041
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,990
Couldn't you introduce a bill?

1042
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:26,270
I don't want to try to
legislate the Internet.

1043
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:28,710
I don't go online myself if I can help it.

1044
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,780
My staff does that for me.

1045
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:32,070
But these kids are
on the Internet all the time.

1046
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:35,280
And they're vulnerable to these bullies
That are hiding behind anonymous usernames.

1047
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,970
But no one's making them
go online are they?

1048
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:41,680
- Excuse me? - They do have
delete buttons on computers.

1049
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:44,570
I thought that too until
I almost lost my daughter.

1050
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,310
You can't keep these kids off
the Internet. It's their world.

1051
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,560
If you can't understand that.

1052
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,640
Maybe somebody on your staff could help me.

1053
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,380
- I can't allocate
man-hours to that.

1054
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,860
In a middle of a budget wrangle.

1055
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:56,120
Why don't you try me again next session?

1056
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,200
Thanks so much for coming in.

1057
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,270
Take the fries off...

1058
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:26,940
You good?

1059
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,590
I hope you don't think it's
weird that I came here.

1060
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,960
I don't know if it is or not.

1061
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,140
Why are you here? Because
if it's about the dance...

1062
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,520
No it's not about the dance.

1063
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:44,010
I'm sorry anyway
for ditching you like that.

1064
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,020
It's ok. Thanks.

1065
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,210
Look I'm here because...

1066
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:53,880
I just wanna know if...

1067
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,770
Did you see the video that I posted?

1068
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,830
Well yeah.
Everyone saw it.

1069
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:04,490
Yeah I just wanna make sure you know that.

1070
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:06,280
That was not because...

1071
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,130
- Because of me?
- Yeah.

1072
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,050
I mean yeah I thought that at first.

1073
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:13,080
And it was like too much.

1074
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:13,810
It freaked me out.

1075
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,670
Oh my God! It was not
because of you.

1076
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:19,610
I know. Even my mom was like:
"dude check your ego.

1077
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:21,640
"there's a lot more
going on here."

1078
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:26,210
Yeah. There was
a lot going on.

1079
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,100
All that crap coming down on you online.

1080
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:33,910
Yeah it was really bad.

1081
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,420
I see that kind of thing
happen all the time.

1082
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,080
And I never say anything.

1083
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,720
And then I saw it happen to you
and it made me feel sick but...

1084
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,800
But...

1085
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,960
I still didn't say anything.
And I really wanted to. I just...

1086
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:47,620
I don't know.

1087
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:52,310
I'm really sorry
that it got so bad for you.

1088
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,210
That's really nice to hear.
Thank you.

1089
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,860
Yeah well it's wrong.

1090
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:00,070
What Lindsay and her stupid
friends were doing to you.

1091
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,100
It's not right that they get away with it.

1092
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,520
Yeah.

1093
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,870
There you are.
I was worried about you.

1094
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,250
You ok?

1095
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,570
I don't want us to give up
on trying to get a law passed.

1096
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,110
Well we can always try
and find a new senator.

1097
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:23,270
No I wanna try something else.

1098
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,750
Dr. Rilke says we have
to call attention to it.

1099
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,540
So I wanna call attention to it.

1100
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,520
Are you sure that's what you wanna do?

1101
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,030
Someone's gotta do something about this.

1102
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,520
Yeah Jay P will do.

1103
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,550
Uh-huh

1104
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,580
St email it to me.

1105
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:45,740
Ok thanks.

1106
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:49,350
Sorry. I spend
more time chasing photos.

1107
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:51,190
Than I do writing the story.

1108
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,320
Ok. So where were we?

1109
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,160
We were talking about how
um kids are getting hurt.

1110
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,270
And adults can't see it
because it's happening online.

1111
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:02,080
And the government isn't doing anything.

1112
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,040
So we need public pressure.

1113
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,340
I won't argue that.

1114
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,410
But as far as your story goes
well it's not news.

1115
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:12,100
I doubt my editor will let me run with it.

1116
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,630
Although...

1117
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:17,640
You said your friend Samantha
made a fake identity.

1118
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,100
And posted things about you
that weren't true?

1119
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:21,510
Yeah.

1120
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:23,790
Now that could be an interesting angle.

1121
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:26,580
I do an interview with
the bully and the bullied.

1122
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:28,390
Think she'd talk to me?

1123
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,840
Uh no. Why would she?

1124
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,980
Lots of people don't wanna
talk to me but lots do.

1125
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,660
Why don't you give me her number?

1126
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,600
I'll give her a call invite her down.

1127
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,050
She might just go for it.

1128
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:41,590
Uh I don't think she'd wanna talk about it.

1129
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,480
Um here's her mother's number.

1130
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,140
Um her name is Karen caldone.

1131
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:50,300
Samantha may be leaving for school.

1132
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,180
Why did you do that?

1133
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:59,240
I'm sorry. I should
have asked you first.

1134
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,920
You know she's gonna think
I'm after her and I'm not.

1135
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:05,460
Honey it's not a bad idea for Samantha.

1136
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,200
To face the consequences of her actions.

1137
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,180
Yeah but not like this.

1138
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,350
Her mother said Samantha agreed to do it.

1139
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:16,130
They'll be here in half an hour.

1140
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:28,330
Go on in.

1141
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:32,470
Hey.

1142
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:34,860
Samantha you can sit by Taylor.

1143
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:38,930
We want you sitting together So we can
take a few shots while we talk ok?

1144
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:44,000
All right Samantha.

1145
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,950
Taylor told me a pretty wild story.

1146
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,160
That you her best friend.

1147
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,950
Tricked her into believing
you were someone else online.

1148
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:53,890
And then as that alternate person.

1149
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:57,100
You spread rumours about her
in an online community.

1150
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,280
Is that true?

1151
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:00,990
Yes.

1152
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:05,130
She didn't think you'd wanna admit it.

1153
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,870
Yeah. Why are
you doing this?

1154
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:12,840
I hate what I did but...

1155
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,400
I'm not gonna pretend I didn't do it.

1156
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,210
Well why?
You pretended just fine before.

1157
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,620
It sounds like you're
still pretty upset at her.

1158
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,190
She has every right to still be mad.

1159
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,480
What I did was horrible.

1160
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:33,100
And I've never been more
sorry in my entire life.

1161
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,690
Well why do it then?

1162
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,980
I had reasons that made sense at the time.

1163
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,120
I thought I was protecting her from a guy.

1164
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,950
I was hurt angry...

1165
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,210
I don't know jealous.

1166
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:57,620
But the reasons didn't matter
once I'd realized I'd hurt her.

1167
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:02,840
So what was going on through your mind.

1168
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,250
When you were doing it the cyberbullying?

1169
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,420
It's hard to picture myself like that.

1170
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:13,410
You know I'd always thought of bullies.

1171
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:16,920
As people at school who pick on you.

1172
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,300
But when you do it online You don't
even realize that you're doing it.

1173
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:27,110
You can't see the other people.

1174
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:31,060
And... and you can
do or say anything.

1175
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,690
And it doesn't seem to matter.

1176
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:38,030
It doesn't feel real.

1177
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:44,540
But it's real when you're
the one getting bullied.

1178
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:48,380
I know because everyone's turned on me now.

1179
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,770
And Taylor I am so sorry That I
ever made you feel anything...

1180
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,280
Wait...

1181
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,480
Lindsay and them they're after you now?
I didn't know that.

1182
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:03,670
It doesn't matter.

1183
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:06,110
I deserve it.

1184
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,630
No you don't.

1185
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,160
Taylor?

1186
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:38,320
I hope this can be the first
step For you and Samantha to...

1187
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,300
Mom please let's just go.

1188
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,580
Hey Samantha wait.

1189
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,300
Thanks for doing this.

1190
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:58,240
They... they wouldn't have run
the story unless you did it too.

1191
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,980
It's fine.

1192
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,400
If it's happening to you now.

1193
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,600
They have support groups
for that kind of thing.

1194
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,900
And it's actually really been helping me.

1195
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,160
Thanks.

1196
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:10,700
I'll think about it.

1197
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,520
I think that went really well don't you?

1198
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,500
I'm ready to go back to school.

1199
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,430
Thank you.

1200
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,790
I wish I could go in.

1201
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,520
Go to class with you
go to lunch with you...

1202
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,160
I'm gonna be fine.

1203
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,560
All this group has been saying Is how I
can't let them have power over me anymore.

1204
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,620
So that's what I'm gonna do.

1205
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:52,670
- When did you
get all grown-up?

1206
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:57,040
Oh my God!
Are you serious?

1207
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,360
I better go.

1208
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,560
Bye.
Bye.

1209
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:36,760
Hey.

1210
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:41,160
I didn't know you'd be coming back today.

1211
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,730
Yeah I didn't either.

1212
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,220
Maybe we can sit together.

1213
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,930
You really want to?

1214
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,220
I don't know if we can ever
be friends in the same way.

1215
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,170
But I'm willing to try.

1216
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,750
I've really missed you.

1217
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,970
Well let's go in then.

1218
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:20,000
Hey over here!

1219
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,830
Oh look it's the psycho twins.

1220
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,810
Just ignore her.

1221
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:37,690
No I'm not gonna ignore it anymore.

1222
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,200
Hey Lindsay?

1223
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,150
I know you think you're being funny.

1224
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:46,510
But you should know
your words actually hurt.

1225
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:49,320
And I think you should stop
attacking people online.

1226
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,310
Get her linds.

1227
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:56,020
No she's right.
You guys should stop.

1228
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:58,140
You're making everyone
around you miserable.

1229
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,030
Aw the twins are
sticking up for each other.

1230
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:02,320
How cute.

1231
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,300
Yeah because that's what friends do.

1232
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:07,440
Stop attacking people on cliquesters.

1233
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,250
You're making it so no one
wants to go on there anymore.

1234
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:12,690
Yeah you seem to me
just like any other bully.

1235
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,350
Spreading hate wherever you go.

1236
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,310
- Oh!
- Yeah man.

1237
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:19,580
I've gotta say the way that
you guys need to hurt people.

1238
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:22,580
Maybe you need to talk
to someone and get some help.

1239
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:35,340
Get out of my face losers.

1240
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:40,510
Get out of here!

1241
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,980
Ok I've dreamed about something like that.

1242
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:44,940
Only a hundred times.

1243
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,060
Hope it was good for you Taylor
'cause it was awesome for me.

1244
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,240
Yeah.

1245
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:59,810
Well you finally stood up.

1246
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:02,870
I'm sorry I took
so long. I just...

1247
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,440
You know things got so intense and...

1248
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,940
It's ok. I know.

1249
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:09,250
I'm sorry.

1250
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:14,180
Well I am starving.
Let's go get some food.

1251
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:15,710
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

1252
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:16,990
It's ok.

1253
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:24,580
So you said something this time.

1254
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,850
You were inspiring.
I was impressed.

1255
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:29,880
Really? 'Cause I think
I'm still shaking.

1256
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:33,980
I'm really glad you're back.

1257
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:35,670
Me too.

1258
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,120
So could I maybe sit
and eat lunch with you?

1259
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:43,660
Maybe I can be the one
who gets the ketchup.

1260
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,020
Yeah I think I'd like that.

1261
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,120
This is kris.

1262
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,020
Hi. Terry dunley
down at the paper.

1263
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:02,880
I just wanted to tell you That I called sen.
Evans to get a comment from him.

1264
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,800
About shooting you down on
sponsoring the cyberbully bill.

1265
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,860
- Oh really?
- Oh yes.

1266
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:10,190
And he said you misunderstood him.

1267
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:12,710
He said his staff is already
working on a proposal.

1268
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,130
To make a new law.

1269
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:18,210
That will make it illegal To harass
minors online in this state.

1270
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:21,100
And he's talking to the school
board To get their input.

1271
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,140
That's terrific.

1272
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,540
