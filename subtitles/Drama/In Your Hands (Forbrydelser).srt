Idle_Hands_(1999) ,BR_MKV_H264_AC3[5.1](Columbia,Eng,Sub) 1280x696

2
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,544
Did you blow 
 the candles out downstairs?

3
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:42,381
Yeah.

4
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,927
Look at this.

5
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:49,639
A Thanksgiving cornucopia 
 made of pie plates and spackle.

6
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:51,933
What the heck is a cornucopia?

7
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,143
It's like a horn of plenty.

8
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,854
Oh, dear, can't it wait?

9
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:59,607
We just finished decorating 
 for Halloween.

10
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:05,780
-Well, good night. 
 -Night.

11
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,385
Go look!

12
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:45,111
Just a prank, that's all. Anton.

13
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,658
Our little Scooter would 
 never do something like that.

14
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,826
Quit calling him that baby name.

15
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:57,457
Anton would not scoot his behind 
 off the couch if the house was on fire.

16
00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:01,252
God knows he didn't help me 
 with the Halloween decorations.

17
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:08,342
Did you hear that? 
 I heard something downstairs.

18
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,886
Well, the dog's out in the yard.

19
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:13,639
It's probably just the cat.

20
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:18,728
Well, go see!

21
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,412
Hey, Bones.

22
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:29,048
Gary?

23
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:58,953
Anton?

24
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:20,015
Gary, you said you--

25
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:24,436
The house could burn down!

26
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:45,999
Wake up!

27
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:49,587
Anton, is that you?

28
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,328
If you'd like to make a call, 
 hang up and try again.

29
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:26,540
If you need help, hang up 
 and then dial your operator.

30
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:32,064
Hey, Mom! We're out of milk!

31
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:40,781
Mom, we're out of dog food!

32
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,011
Murder in Bolan.: Aa Special Report.

33
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:06,640
Four bodies have been found. 
 The killer is still at large.

34
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:08,642
Bolan is gripped with fear.

35
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:11,186
The killings spread 
 from a postal route...

36
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:14,815
... to the bowling alley and 
 now to our own Burger Jungle.

37
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:17,025
With Halloween only one day away...

38
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:20,987
...Bolan officials have set 
 a 9 p.m. curfew for all teenagers.

39
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:46,138
Hey. What's up, man?

40
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,515
-What's up with you? 
 -I'm dry.

41
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:51,977
-So? 
 -So why don't you bring me a dimer?

42
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,438
This ain't Domino's, you lazy bitch. 
 Come over and get it.

43
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:57,983
Come on, man. I'm comfortable.

44
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:00,944
Hello?

45
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,423
What's up, Anton?

46
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,677
Nice outfit!

47
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,565
Yeah? If your mom had teeth, 
 she wouldn't suck dick so well.

48
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:40,150
What's your point?

49
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,194
What's up, Anton?

50
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:45,822
How's it going, brother?

51
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:47,907
Nice boxers.

52
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:50,911
Pass the chronic.

53
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:53,705
I'm sorry, man. 
 This bong is cashed.

54
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:56,041
You said he was holding.

55
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,877
l didn't say what I was holding.

56
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,719
That's messed up.

57
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:11,223
I hear if you combine nutmeg and 
 oregano, you can get pretty wasted.

58
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,433
All you do is smoke pot...

59
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:15,018
...and watch TV all day.

60
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:18,146
Don't get me wrong. 
 That's what life is all about.

61
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,691
But don't you think you should 
 have some ambition, a goal?

62
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,195
Yeah. I mean, 
 my dream life would be...

63
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:30,325
...to lie around and watch TV 
 while some hot broad delivers me food.

64
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,286
Until your parents 
 kick your oily ass out.

65
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:36,956
I haven't seen my parents 
 in a few days.

66
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,917
Maybe they're dead. 
 Party at Anton's.

67
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:41,503
What are you doing?

68
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:44,464
With a killer loose, 
 you can't rule out murder.

69
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:45,716
What killer?

70
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:47,509
Don't you watch the news?

71
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:49,427
I hate that fucking show.

72
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,263
Our little town is 
 in the national spotlight.

73
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,098
Local mailman, iced.

74
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:56,809
Barmaid at the bowling alley, iced.

75
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,854
You haven't heard about the twins?

76
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:02,065
They were jerking off 
 in the milkshake-maker again?

77
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,611
lced times two. Last night, when 
 they were working at Burger Jungle.

78
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:08,571
Damn.

79
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,076
Anton, here comes your woman.

80
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,997
He's got serious problems.

81
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:30,134
Molly's lived across the street 
 for, like, what, ever?

82
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:32,804
Tell her about your 
 obsession with her.

83
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:36,975
-Start by telling her your name. 
 -Yeah, man. She's waiting for you.

84
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,810
She's not waiting for me.

85
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,064
Would you stop being such a puss 
 and go, like, ask her to the dance?

86
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:44,440
What dance?

87
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:47,402
If you'd been to school recently, 
 you'd know.

88
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:49,320
Halloween thing in the gym?

89
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,074
9:00 curfew? 
 No trick-or-treating allowed?

90
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:54,493
Dumb-ass dance is the only option.

91
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:55,744
You guys going?

92
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:58,913
Hell, no. Can you see us 
 in stupid-ass costumes?

93
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:00,665
Grooving to Hanson and Jewel?

94
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:03,459
What do we look like, 
 total losers, man?

95
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:07,756
I see your point.

96
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,010
She dropped her lyrics book.

97
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:15,722
She'll catch you reading that 
 over her shoulder in biology.

98
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:18,933
Her songs are badass. 
 She's like a poet or something.

99
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:23,604
Go bring it back to her. 
 Be like a knight in shining armour.

100
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:28,026
She'd be all grateful, invite me in, 
 offer me a drink, I'd accept.

101
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:29,819
She'd rip your clothes off...

102
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,072
...and make sweet love to you, 
 Red Shoe Diary-style.

103
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:36,617
-Right. 
 -Could happen.

104
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,328
Just go talk to her, man!

105
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:42,666
Maybe she'll think you're funny 
 or something.

106
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,751
You know what?

107
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:46,628
I think I'm going to.

108
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,130
You want to borrow some pants, chief?

109
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:51,132
First impressions and all.

110
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:52,634
You're a bud.

111
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,305
Think he's gonna do it?

112
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:00,517
So you gotta reach.

113
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,605
You're getting Cheezy Poofs everywhere.

114
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:07,899
You gotta open your mouth, man.

115
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:11,194
Lookie what I found.

116
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:12,862
I thought you were dry.

117
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:14,071
I guess not.

118
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,868
Fire me up.

119
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,196
These are great.

120
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:12,505
My book!

121
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:14,674
Thank you so much...

122
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:16,676
...for returning it.

123
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:42,994
You're certain this is the right man?

124
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:46,039
Well, I'll tell you, 
 Sister Liquor--

125
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:48,583
That's LeCure.

126
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,003
-Debi's fine. 
 -All right, Sister Debi.

127
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:54,005
He's right here.

128
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:02,263
It's gone!

129
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:04,140
Shit!

130
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,434
Missed it again.

131
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:11,480
Where did it go?

132
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:29,665
Beaver.

133
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:39,425
Bolan.

134
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:46,891
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

135
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:01,322
Holy shit!

136
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:46,242
Don't move!

137
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,036
Roll over!

138
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:49,787
Roll over!

139
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,542
Anton Tobias.

140
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:57,795
You got a reason 
 for prowling around here?

141
00:17:58,045 --> 00:17:58,962
l live here.

142
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:01,508
Since when is it illegal 
 to grocery shop?

143
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:03,593
Hey, I know you guys.

144
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:07,305
You guys were seniors 
 when I was a freshman.

145
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:09,348
Let's talk about high school.

146
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:12,685
You and your stoner friends 
 zipping around on skateboards.

147
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:14,645
Thought you were too cool for us.

148
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:18,316
Did you even once invite us 
 to get high behind the gym?

149
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,151
You were dorks.

150
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:28,325
Either of you holding?

151
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:29,618
What?

152
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:32,913
I'm desperate. I know you can 
 get in the evidence room--

153
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:36,626
You asshole! 
 You're trying to score from a cop?

154
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:40,171
That's it. 
 Complete personal-effects search.

155
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:43,883
What's this?

156
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,594
Stupid, that's an asthma inhaler.

157
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:51,014
Empty your pockets, boy.

158
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:52,349
They're not my pants.

159
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:53,768
Let's go!

160
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:01,942
George found a new home.

161
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:06,071
What have we here?

162
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:08,115
Officer?

163
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,661
Smells like marijuana to me.

164
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:12,912
Write it up, Ruck.

165
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:14,288
What? It's empty.

166
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:17,500
You can't cite me 
 for possession of a baggie.

167
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:21,879
Littering.

168
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:23,797
Maximum fine.

169
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:27,635
Two hundred dollars.

170
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:30,555
Right.

171
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:00,203
Oh, shit! The killer's here!

172
00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:02,748
The killer's in my house!

173
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:35,280
Okay, Dukey.

174
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:39,452
Everything's gonna be okay. 
 Come on, come on.

175
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:44,623
Everything's going to be fine.

176
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:46,542
Yes, it is.

177
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,148
All right, boy.

178
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:16,739
He's not dead!

179
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,877
Duke! Come on, lay down!

180
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:31,295
Get down, Duke!

181
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:34,381
All right.

182
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:45,016
Hold on, Duke. Hold on.

183
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:48,687
Where's the phone?

184
00:23:57,028 --> 00:23:58,613
Run, Duke, run!

185
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:00,865
He's under the bed!

186
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:15,714
Mom?

187
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:21,303
Dad?

188
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:41,907
What's the matter? 
 Bad shrooms?

189
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:44,493
You got a fever? Here you go.

190
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:46,620
I'm going to show you.

191
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:56,672
Oh, man!

192
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,010
I love this video. I didn't think 
 they could show it anymore.

193
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:04,137
Guys!

194
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:07,641
Someone killed my parents!

195
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:09,059
This is the best part.

196
00:25:12,938 --> 00:25:14,106
Shake them, baby.

197
00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:18,694
Look! Look!

198
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:22,113
-Shit! 
 -Yeah, you see?

199
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:28,161
Mr. Tobias?

200
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:29,537
Miss T.?

201
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:37,796
Is this some kind of Halloween gag? 
 Your parents always go all out.

202
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:43,760
What the fuck are you doing? 
 That's my dad!

203
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,888
CPR, man. I saw it on Baywatch.

204
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:57,357
Check it out.

205
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:02,570
A clue.

206
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,488
"Ant"? They were killed by ants?

207
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,740
Please, don't be stupid.

208
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,575
Do you have an evil aunt?

209
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,578
Holy shit!

210
00:26:56,124 --> 00:26:57,209
Are those ears?

211
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:59,378
Ear rings?

212
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:00,962
They're both lefts.

213
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:04,591
You know what that means.

214
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:07,469
Feldstein twins.

215
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:27,572
The killer was wearing your shirt.

216
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:33,704
The killer was wearing me.

217
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,459
I'm the killer.

218
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:45,089
I'm gonna call 911.

219
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:47,258
What's the number?

220
00:27:53,515 --> 00:27:55,725
There's something wrong 
 with my friend.

221
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,686
I think he took 
 some nutmeg or something.

222
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,483
Mick, buddy.

223
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:07,904
- I would remember something like that. 
 -You would.

224
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:10,073
I'm not the killer. You know?

225
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:13,993
Yeah, I know. But if O.J. 
 could get off, then I'm sure--

226
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,038
Do you want a beer?

227
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:18,664
-No, thanks. 
 -You sure?

228
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,601
Talk to me!

229
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:44,608
What the hell is happening to me?

230
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:53,116
Pnub, man.

231
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,451
I didn't do it.

232
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,415
Okay, I did it. 
 But it was an accident.

233
00:29:00,624 --> 00:29:02,917
I can't believe 
 you told me to smoke that shit!

234
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:07,088
Okay, Anton. 
 I have to leave now.

235
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:09,841
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

236
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:30,569
It's the basement! 
 You can't get out that way!

237
00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:45,126
Why are you doing this?

238
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:46,669
I don't know!

239
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,171
It's me, Pnub! Your buddy!

240
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:53,176
l know who you are. 
 I don't want to hurt you.

241
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:54,511
Then don't!

242
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:58,473
It's not me!

243
00:29:58,723 --> 00:29:59,891
It's my hand!

244
00:30:00,183 --> 00:30:02,560
It's like I have no control 
 over my hand!

245
00:30:08,817 --> 00:30:11,194
I don't know how long 
 I can hold it. Run!

246
00:30:11,402 --> 00:30:12,570
Get out of my way!

247
00:30:12,862 --> 00:30:13,696
Just go!

248
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:19,660
It's going to be okay. 
 I won't tell anybody.

249
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:21,037
I swear.

250
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,997
Everything will be cool.

251
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:24,249
Everything will be...

252
00:30:37,178 --> 00:30:38,721
...cool.

253
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,680
What have I done?

254
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:24,225
What have I done?

255
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:19,321
Get out of here, Bones!

256
00:32:20,948 --> 00:32:22,116
Git!

257
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,009
Bones?

258
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,354
Here, kitty, kitty.

259
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,513
Aren't you a little old 
 for ding-dong ditch?

260
00:33:28,182 --> 00:33:29,975
Sorry about your bush.

261
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:35,940
No problem.

262
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,987
What were you doing out there anyway?

263
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:49,578
Jesus, look at you!

264
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,334
I was looking for my cat.

265
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:56,836
We got in a fight.

266
00:33:57,837 --> 00:33:59,505
You sure got your ass kicked.

267
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:01,757
I did okay.

268
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:06,929
So you ran and hid in my bush.

269
00:34:10,808 --> 00:34:12,435
I shouldn't be here.

270
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,562
I'm not myself today.

271
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,439
I'm someone completely different.

272
00:34:18,566 --> 00:34:20,317
You're so shy.

273
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:21,735
It's okay. I get it.

274
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:25,572
So let's skip this chickening-out, 
 sneaking-around stage.

275
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:28,868
No, you don't understand. I'm--

276
00:34:33,414 --> 00:34:35,874
Do you want to come inside and talk?

277
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:49,305
You never gave me a chance to thank you. 
 That book is important to me.

278
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:55,269
So...

279
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:59,189
...nothing cooler than 
 a chick bass-guitar player.

280
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:02,568
Especially one that writes 
 her own lyrics.

281
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:04,362
You read them?

282
00:35:06,197 --> 00:35:09,408
I couldn't help looking in the book. 
 They're amazing.

283
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:12,327
Look, I even got 
 my favourites memorized.

284
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:14,329
Devil girl with nothing to lose

285
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,960
She got wind in her hair 
 Aand gum on her shoes

286
00:35:22,129 --> 00:35:23,964
I was 13 when I wrote that.

287
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:25,633
Yeah, well...

288
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,343
...they're amazing.

289
00:35:27,676 --> 00:35:28,927
Thanks.

290
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:47,070
I should not be here, Molly.

291
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:51,158
Safer in here than on the streets. 
 There's a killer out there.

292
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,664
That's exactly what I'm saying. 
 I'm dangerous.

293
00:35:57,164 --> 00:35:58,165
Oh, yeah?

294
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,417
How dangerous?

295
00:36:02,419 --> 00:36:03,587
I'm not kidding.

296
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,797
I've done stuff, you know?

297
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:18,560
I'm impressed.

298
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:22,939
I never would've thought you'd have 
 the balls to just grab me like that.

299
00:36:24,524 --> 00:36:25,775
Me either.

300
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:20,289
You're kinky.

301
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:23,250
That's me.

302
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:42,561
Move it, people! Let's go!

303
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:44,938
Some of us are 
 on serious missions here.

304
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:49,276
There's evil out there, 
 and I gotta kick its ass!

305
00:37:57,076 --> 00:38:00,996
Shit, my parents are home. 
 We'll have to pick this up later.

306
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:04,916
My parents might take offense to some 
 bloody boy banging their daughter.

307
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,293
Tomorrow.

308
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,920
-You want to see me? 
 -Come by at 7.

309
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:14,760
The curfew's annihilated our options, 
 but we can go to the dance.

310
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,721
I thought you said 
 the streets weren't safe.

311
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:20,223
I'll protect you.

312
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,379
Dearly beloved...

313
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:54,591
...we're gathered here today 
 because you're all dead.

314
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:57,135
And it's my fault.

315
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,388
Mom, Dad...

316
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:03,559
...what can I say? I mean...

317
00:39:04,184 --> 00:39:06,228
...you brought me into this world...

318
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:10,399
...you put a roof over my head, 
 you fed me until I killed you.

319
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,654
If you look at it that way, I haven't 
 been a good son, but I'm really...

320
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,073
...really, really sorry.

321
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:21,285
And wherever you are...

322
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:25,372
... I just want you to forgive me...

323
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:27,999
...because I'm gonna try to change.

324
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:34,756
Mick...

325
00:39:35,048 --> 00:39:36,466
...Pnub, guys....

326
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:41,513
You guys were the greatest. 
 I'm never going to forget...

327
00:39:41,722 --> 00:39:46,852
...the way we sat around all day, 
 watched TV and got really stoned.

328
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:49,646
And all those other times 
 where we just....

329
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:55,736
I guess that's all we did.

330
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:02,325
Amen.

331
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,216
Over here.

332
00:40:19,843 --> 00:40:21,428
Anton, help me.

333
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:26,140
Come on, man. 
 I can't breathe down here.

334
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:35,192
Anton, can you hear me?

335
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:37,819
Yeah, man, Mick.

336
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:40,155
Now get me out of here.

337
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:42,532
You're dead.

338
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:43,616
No, I'm not.

339
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:47,579
You conked my head pretty good. 
 I must've been unconscious.

340
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:52,501
-You think? 
 - I know, fucker. Now dig me up!

341
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,388
Stay where you are, Mick!

342
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,305
Please don't kill me.

343
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:51,351
Watch it, man!

344
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:13,665
What did I take last night?

345
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:18,086
That dream was intense.

346
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:21,548
Intense.

347
00:42:28,304 --> 00:42:31,016
-Turn it up. Check it out. 
 -Yeah, I'm watching.

348
00:42:32,392 --> 00:42:33,226
Did you see?

349
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:34,686
-Guys! 
 -That's funny.

350
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:38,606
Thank God you're alive, because 
 I had this dream that I killed--

351
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:46,781
Shit!

352
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:51,161
Sorry about that thing 
 with the shovel.

353
00:42:51,953 --> 00:42:53,830
-You're dead. 
 -Easy, tiger.

354
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:56,040
Undead, actually.

355
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:58,501
You said you were unconscious. 
 You lied.

356
00:42:58,751 --> 00:43:02,421
You killed me, all right? 
 Try and keep this thing in perspective.

357
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,801
I was bitter about the 
 getting-killed-by-my-best-friend thing.

358
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:07,511
But I got over it.

359
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,109
So why you here?

360
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:23,777
We need a place to kick it.

361
00:43:24,027 --> 00:43:26,821
Don't be selfish. 
 No one else's parents are dead.

362
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,699
No, not why are you " here" here. 
 I mean...

363
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:33,661
...are you flesh-eating zombies 
 back from hell to exact revenge?

364
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:35,329
Is that it?

365
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:37,623
Why would we go to hell?

366
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:38,708
We're not bad.

367
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:42,462
It's not like we're good, 
 but at least we don't kill people!

368
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:44,839
I didn't kill anybody on purpose.

369
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,634
Yeah, well, we weren't in hell.

370
00:43:47,884 --> 00:43:50,928
There was this bright light 
 at the end of a long tunnel.

371
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:54,348
There were all these chicks' voices. 
 And that music.

372
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,474
Music?

373
00:43:55,808 --> 00:43:58,478
Kind of uncool music, like Enya.

374
00:43:58,728 --> 00:44:00,397
And these chicks were saying...

375
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:03,483
..." Come to us. 
 Come towards the light."

376
00:44:06,194 --> 00:44:07,570
So what happened?

377
00:44:07,904 --> 00:44:09,447
We figured, fuck it.

378
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:11,574
I mean, it was really far.

379
00:44:17,747 --> 00:44:19,958
I've got to ask. 
 What's with the hand?

380
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:24,462
It doesn't obey me at all.

381
00:44:24,754 --> 00:44:28,007
The only thing I can come up with is, 
 it's possessed.

382
00:44:29,216 --> 00:44:32,387
Do you guys know anything 
 about Satan or evil or...?

383
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:33,972
No.

384
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:38,226
But we know somebody who does.

385
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:11,926
Did you know them well?

386
00:45:12,802 --> 00:45:14,554
Not really.

387
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,055
You?

388
00:45:17,056 --> 00:45:19,183
Yeah, they were great.

389
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:23,855
I just feel really bad, you know, 
 because I was always so mean to them.

390
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:28,860
Like this one time, they asked me 
 to go on a double-date...

391
00:45:29,152 --> 00:45:32,905
...and I thought they were 'tards, 
 because there's only one of me.

392
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:36,617
So I told them to go blow each other.

393
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:41,039
Did they?

394
00:45:47,128 --> 00:45:48,379
The way you treated them...

395
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,382
...the guilt must be making you feel 
 like shit inside.

396
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,217
Randy!

397
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:55,302
You're still in high school?

398
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:58,181
Yeah, me, I got out 
 about three years ago.

399
00:45:58,431 --> 00:45:59,808
I need your help.

400
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:03,186
What are you playing, 
 a little two-ball?

401
00:46:04,145 --> 00:46:07,356
I gotta talk to you. 
 There's serious stuff going on.

402
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:11,193
Anton, can't you see I'm getting 
 a little action over here?

403
00:46:15,865 --> 00:46:19,369
Oh, man. I can't believe 
 you cock-blocked me like that.

404
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,662
I thought we were buds.

405
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:23,247
Randy, wait!

406
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,334
I didn't mean to mess you up. 
 Listen.

407
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:28,210
I need your help.

408
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:33,508
Piss off!

409
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:52,235
Fresh tomatoes....

410
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,405
Hey! Who are you?

411
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,657
New. Drive-thru duty.

412
00:46:57,907 --> 00:46:59,075
Excuse me.

413
00:47:00,534 --> 00:47:01,619
Sorry.

414
00:47:12,964 --> 00:47:14,840
-Break time. 
 -All right.

415
00:47:15,675 --> 00:47:18,552
Give me the Big Five with 
 the Spicy Safari Fries...

416
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:20,888
...the African Apple Turnover...

417
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,140
...and the Raspberry Rainforest Shake.

418
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,935
Slap some extra mustard 
 on that Jungle Burger.

419
00:47:26,227 --> 00:47:28,521
Tell me everything you know 
 about the devil.

420
00:47:30,398 --> 00:47:32,316
Aare you out of your fucking mind?

421
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:36,820
You listen to satanic music. 
 You must've picked up something.

422
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:39,740
Look, it's just music.

423
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:42,785
Like Mozart and that other fag....

424
00:47:44,537 --> 00:47:45,538
Keep it clean.

425
00:47:46,622 --> 00:47:47,999
Who, Beethoven?

426
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:51,544
That's the guy. It's just like 
 their music, only louder.

427
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:53,337
You gotta know. 
 I'm desperate.

428
00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:54,922
Oh, man!

429
00:47:58,426 --> 00:47:59,594
Here!

430
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,387
Asshole!

431
00:48:04,724 --> 00:48:07,852
It's my hand. It's like it's got 
 a mind of its own.

432
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,521
It makes me do things 
 I don't want it to do.

433
00:48:11,272 --> 00:48:12,606
I used to be like that.

434
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,234
Get into all kinds of stupid shit.

435
00:48:15,527 --> 00:48:16,611
Look, the trick is...

436
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:18,696
...to keep yourself busy.

437
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:21,240
That's why I'm always 
 working on the Ford.

438
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:23,409
Keeps me out of trouble.

439
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:26,787
Idle hands are the devil's playground.

440
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:29,123
Keep my hands busy.

441
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,752
Yeah, that actually makes sense.

442
00:48:33,044 --> 00:48:34,295
Thanks. 
 You're the coolest.

443
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,312
So do you, like, knit now?

444
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:54,982
Don't take this the wrong way, 
 but you look queer doing that.

445
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,318
Randy broke it down for me.

446
00:48:57,943 --> 00:49:00,821
" Idle hands are the devil's playpen." 
 So I'm thinking...

447
00:49:01,447 --> 00:49:03,741
...keep my hands occupied, right?

448
00:49:04,116 --> 00:49:06,493
Man, that saying's not literal.

449
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,079
It's more like...

450
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:09,789
...you know....

451
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,666
Metaphorical?

452
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,376
Right.

453
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:28,599
This is the noise complaint.

454
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:31,268
Ain't this the Tobias residence?

455
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:41,445
Holy shit! It's Anton. 
 He's the killer!

456
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:43,990
- I better call for backup. 
 -Are you crazy?

457
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:47,868
And let the feds get the credit? 
 If we collar him, we'll be heroes.

458
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,745
We can't go in without a warrant.

459
00:49:49,995 --> 00:49:52,206
Piss on the Bill of Rights! 
 We got just cause.

460
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:54,708
Freeze!

461
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,210
Yeah, freeze!

462
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,174
Guys...

463
00:50:02,508 --> 00:50:03,426
...what do I do?

464
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:05,886
I think you--

465
00:50:11,183 --> 00:50:13,560
I was gonna say to do 
 what they tell you...

466
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,312
...but now I changed my mind.

467
00:50:15,562 --> 00:50:17,190
You should just kill them.

468
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:20,401
-They're alive! 
 -They are not!

469
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:22,820
You shot one in the head! 
 They're morgue-meat.

470
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:26,365
Look, guys. I don't want 
 to kill anybody else.

471
00:50:28,117 --> 00:50:30,244
You don't want to go to jail, though.

472
00:50:30,577 --> 00:50:33,038
Jail. That's it!

473
00:50:33,288 --> 00:50:36,709
They'll throw me in a rubber room. 
 I can't hurt anybody else.

474
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:38,294
Cuff me!

475
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:40,796
Okay. Just...

476
00:50:42,548 --> 00:50:44,258
...drop the knitting needles.

477
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,803
That's not a good idea. 
 Why don't you just cuff me?

478
00:50:48,303 --> 00:50:51,307
Drop the needles 
 and put your hands on your head!

479
00:50:51,557 --> 00:50:52,642
I can't!

480
00:50:53,142 --> 00:50:55,269
Put down the needles 
 and come quietly.

481
00:50:55,561 --> 00:50:57,938
-Cuff me! 
 -Put the needles down now!

482
00:50:58,272 --> 00:50:59,940
-Cuff me! 
 -Put them down!

483
00:51:00,232 --> 00:51:01,650
-Put them down! 
 -Cuff me!

484
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,390
Go, go, Buffalo!

485
00:51:36,852 --> 00:51:38,020
Stop!

486
00:51:38,812 --> 00:51:40,689
I didn't do it. It was my hand.

487
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:43,693
It's like, the knitting 
 didn't help at all.

488
00:51:43,943 --> 00:51:46,946
I told you that saying 
 was more, like, metaphorical.

489
00:51:55,871 --> 00:51:58,165
I can't keep doing this!

490
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,627
I'm losing my mind.

491
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:18,978
Get your head.

492
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:30,155
No way.

493
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,991
It's the only thing I can think of.

494
00:52:33,325 --> 00:52:36,704
Once that hand is gone, 
 how will you cut off the other one?

495
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,289
The left one's a keeper.

496
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:40,833
I mean, I guess it wasn't idle enough.

497
00:52:41,542 --> 00:52:42,543
Are you sure?

498
00:52:43,669 --> 00:52:47,714
I use it for a lot of things. 
 I light up, I change the remote...

499
00:52:48,256 --> 00:52:50,342
... I relieve a little tension.

500
00:52:50,842 --> 00:52:52,887
This is the answer. I know it.

501
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:55,931
Those things won't even cut my bagel.

502
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:00,060
Shit!

503
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,318
Grab the carver.

504
00:53:14,366 --> 00:53:15,617
Look at me!

505
00:53:15,868 --> 00:53:17,703
I'm Leatherface!

506
00:53:19,913 --> 00:53:20,914
Thanks, Mick.

507
00:53:24,209 --> 00:53:26,169
I'll just use this one.

508
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:29,006
I can't watch.

509
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:51,069
You missed.

510
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,196
Pnub...

511
00:53:54,322 --> 00:53:55,407
...bite down.

512
00:53:55,782 --> 00:53:57,117
Don't cut me, man!

513
00:54:07,794 --> 00:54:09,588
You scream like a girl.

514
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:14,134
What the hell are you doing?

515
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:20,349
I gotta stop the blood flow. 
 Don't you watch ER?

516
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:26,146
Look at that nasty thing. 
 That's gonna be infected for sure.

517
00:54:26,438 --> 00:54:28,398
You got any antiseptic, Anton?

518
00:54:28,648 --> 00:54:29,649
I don't know.

519
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:32,902
Pnub's got some in a first-aid kit 
 in his house.

520
00:54:33,194 --> 00:54:34,279
And burritos.

521
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:36,448
You'll be okay, buddy.

522
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:39,243
We'll be back in a sec 
 to fix you up, Anton.

523
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:46,583
Catch you on the flip-flop.

524
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,437
Oh, shit!

525
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:30,377
Anton, are you home?

526
00:55:34,172 --> 00:55:36,383
Don't come in! 
 Just stay there, okay?

527
00:55:37,175 --> 00:55:38,802
Very funny, Anton.

528
00:55:39,052 --> 00:55:40,595
Stay out there, Molly!

529
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:42,805
I'm freezing my butt off.

530
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,114
Anton, we're gonna be late.

531
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:09,040
Anton, I can hear you in there!

532
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:11,001
Stay outside!

533
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:14,045
Come on, Anton!

534
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:22,804
Let's go! 
 We're gonna be late!

535
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:37,027
We're gonna miss the band.

536
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:44,409
Fry!

537
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:50,790
Gross.

538
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:53,126
Anton, I'm coming in.

539
00:56:57,798 --> 00:56:58,632
Wait!

540
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:10,351
You look incredible.

541
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,521
Thanks. But you should've called.

542
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:16,399
If you needed more time with your 
 costume, fine. But I hate waiting.

543
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:19,152
So what are you supposed 
 to be, anyway?

544
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:22,864
I'm...

545
00:57:23,656 --> 00:57:26,868
...a fast-food employee that 
 cut off his own hand.

546
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,244
Cute.

547
00:57:35,293 --> 00:57:36,294
Come on!

548
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:41,883
Anton, we're back!

549
00:57:42,675 --> 00:57:45,804
We got antiseptic 
 and adhesive bandages!

550
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:47,806
The ouch-free kind!

551
00:57:52,727 --> 00:57:56,231
" Microwave for three minutes 
 and enjoy."

552
00:57:57,148 --> 00:57:59,150
That's really getting on my nerves.

553
00:58:10,078 --> 00:58:11,830
What are you doing?

554
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:14,874
Could you...?

555
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:16,292
This way.

556
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:17,668
Easy.

557
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,425
Yeah. That's better.

558
00:58:26,678 --> 00:58:27,762
All right.

559
00:58:33,184 --> 00:58:34,435
Thanks, man!

560
00:58:39,274 --> 00:58:40,525
Gross!

561
00:58:41,276 --> 00:58:43,278
Maybe we should clean it first.

562
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:47,532
Hey, yeah! And while we're at it, 
 we can clean the whole house.

563
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,367
This ain't our mess.

564
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:12,891
Look, I can't go to the dance yet, 
 okay? I'm sorry.

565
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:16,144
My parents will be home 
 in a few minutes.

566
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:19,063
If they see the mess I made, 
 they'll kill me.

567
00:59:19,814 --> 00:59:21,941
Look, I won't be too long.

568
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,568
I'll meet you there.

569
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:26,445
Is something wrong?

570
00:59:26,654 --> 00:59:28,406
You need to go there now...

571
00:59:28,614 --> 00:59:33,161
...and you can't stop till you're 
 inside with everyone else, okay?

572
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,538
You wouldn't stand me up, would you?

573
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,666
Not a chance, babysnakes.

574
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:48,677
I'll get the next one.

575
00:59:56,434 --> 00:59:58,352
Shit! I bit my tongue.

576
01:00:06,027 --> 01:00:07,112
That's disgusting.

577
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:13,409
I bet I can fix that for you.

578
01:00:25,713 --> 01:00:26,631
Hold still.

579
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:31,177
That's better.

580
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,846
Burrito, burrito

581
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:38,476
Wait, wait! Don't open it!

582
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,646
I'm sorry, there were only two.

583
01:00:41,896 --> 01:00:44,274
No! You let the hand out!

584
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,236
We brought you a first-aid kit.

585
01:00:49,695 --> 01:00:52,490
-Where did it go? 
 -What? You mean the hand?

586
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,824
Of course, the hand.

587
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,912
Try looking up your ass.

588
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:13,636
Damn.

589
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,415
Hey, foxy.

590
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:44,875
Looking for a ball?

591
01:01:45,084 --> 01:01:49,005
Because I could help you find one 
 that's the right size for you.

592
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:51,090
What the hell?

593
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:52,717
Try and keep up.

594
01:01:53,134 --> 01:01:55,970
I'd be happy to keep up 
 with you, sweet thing.

595
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:01,058
Don't you have a dance to go to?

596
01:02:01,725 --> 01:02:04,353
That's right. 
 We gotta do our costumes.

597
01:02:04,561 --> 01:02:07,023
-You coming, Randy? 
 -No.

598
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:09,233
I think I can find myself a ride.

599
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:10,735
All right.

600
01:02:14,113 --> 01:02:15,990
So what brings you to Bolan?

601
01:02:17,825 --> 01:02:19,159
You don't want to know.

602
01:02:19,618 --> 01:02:22,330
No, seriously. 
 I'm interested.

603
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:23,706
Really?

604
01:02:26,751 --> 01:02:28,294
Here it goes.

605
01:02:29,253 --> 01:02:33,007
I'm a Druidic priestess sworn 
 to fight a certain evil force...

606
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:36,260
...that possesses the laziest 
 fuckup it can find.

607
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,138
It will kill as many people 
 as possible...

608
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,642
...and then drag a free soul 
 into the Netherworld.

609
01:02:45,019 --> 01:02:47,229
That's some weighty shit there.

610
01:02:47,688 --> 01:02:48,856
Here's the kicker.

611
01:02:49,106 --> 01:02:52,526
I have the one thing 
 that can stop this from happening.

612
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:56,530
I just need to find the bastard 
 whose hand is possessed.

613
01:02:57,198 --> 01:02:58,283
Weird.

614
01:02:58,533 --> 01:03:02,703
Earlier today, this guy, Anton, 
 told me his hand was doing stuff...

615
01:03:02,954 --> 01:03:05,039
...that he didn't want it to do.

616
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,500
Don't you fuck with me!

617
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,376
Ease up, there, kitten.

618
01:03:09,627 --> 01:03:12,713
I'm telling you the truth. 
 This guy was freaked!

619
01:03:13,172 --> 01:03:14,841
Show me where he lives.

620
01:03:27,936 --> 01:03:30,230
Left! Turn left!

621
01:03:51,544 --> 01:03:54,338
Guys! We gotta go to the dance.

622
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,091
The hand, it's after Molly.

623
01:03:57,758 --> 01:04:00,219
Let's check out the dance. 
 I'll win Best Costume.

624
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,555
Chicks dig winners. 
 I'll probably hook up.

625
01:04:03,805 --> 01:04:08,060
Yeah, because severed heads are 
 one of the top 10 big turn-ons.

626
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:12,523
It kills me to see you stressed out.

627
01:04:12,732 --> 01:04:15,985
You cut off your hand 
 in the interest of others.

628
01:04:16,235 --> 01:04:17,403
It's not your problem anymore.

629
01:04:17,778 --> 01:04:21,615
So what I want you to do 
 is take a little Anton-time.

630
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:25,286
Just relax and kick back, my man.

631
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:27,413
No, no. You know what?

632
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:31,208
Not this time, okay?

633
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:34,795
I'm through with that. 
 All I do is sit around.

634
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:37,714
I veg out, I watch TV, 
 I smoke pot--

635
01:04:37,923 --> 01:04:40,551
No Kevin Costner speeches. 
 Let's just go.

636
01:04:45,306 --> 01:04:46,390
Come on!

637
01:04:55,816 --> 01:04:57,275
Let's go! Come on, come on!

638
01:04:57,484 --> 01:04:58,820
That's him!

639
01:04:59,403 --> 01:05:02,573
-They're getting into my Ford! 
 -Wait here. He's dangerous.

640
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:05,701
Wait. 
 Don't let him steal my Ford.

641
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:07,786
Trust me. 
 I know what I'm doing.

642
01:05:11,081 --> 01:05:12,249
That's lucky.

643
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:14,418
Shit.

644
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:16,420
Couldn't be automatic.

645
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,214
Want me to drive?

646
01:05:18,464 --> 01:05:19,715
No, just shift for me.

647
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,558
Anton! Wait!

648
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,444
What was that?

649
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:41,737
Who cares?

650
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:55,167
Get back here!

651
01:06:22,569 --> 01:06:24,614
Who's got the barf breath?

652
01:06:47,928 --> 01:06:50,055
Damn! 
 It's hot in here.

653
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:52,766
So are you, babe.

654
01:06:56,269 --> 01:06:59,231
I'm sweating my costume off, Curtis.

655
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,236
Better?

656
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,210
Help me get this off.

657
01:07:40,147 --> 01:07:41,940
Right there.

658
01:08:23,356 --> 01:08:24,357
It's here.

659
01:08:25,276 --> 01:08:27,319
You guys go protect Molly.

660
01:08:27,653 --> 01:08:28,904
I'll go after the hand.

661
01:08:31,698 --> 01:08:33,825
-What a waste. 
 -You didn't like Curtis.

662
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:35,911
I'm talking about that ass!

663
01:08:36,161 --> 01:08:37,954
Well, at least he died happy.

664
01:09:05,065 --> 01:09:06,483
What's bugging you?

665
01:09:06,733 --> 01:09:08,151
Just thinking.

666
01:09:08,902 --> 01:09:10,487
And I know who about.

667
01:09:10,987 --> 01:09:12,781
Just thought he'd be here by now.

668
01:09:13,656 --> 01:09:15,241
He'll be here.

669
01:09:17,703 --> 01:09:20,247
I'll go get some punch. 
 You want some?

670
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:22,666
Okay, I'll be right back.

671
01:09:48,441 --> 01:09:50,360
You guys look great!

672
01:09:51,152 --> 01:09:52,863
Who did your makeup?

673
01:09:54,406 --> 01:09:57,617
- I guess Anton did. 
 -Based on my design, though.

674
01:09:58,660 --> 01:09:59,578
You want to dance?

675
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,787
Hell, yeah!

676
01:10:03,998 --> 01:10:06,084
-We should find Molly. 
 -Quit being a skirt.

677
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:09,797
We'll look for her while we dance. 
 There's plenty of chicks here.

678
01:10:10,547 --> 01:10:12,925
-Careful, it's on kind of loose. 
 -Cool!

679
01:10:38,283 --> 01:10:41,703
Don't put me on hold again. 
 I want to talk to your supervisor.

680
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:43,162
What?

681
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:45,874
Yes, of course.

682
01:10:49,377 --> 01:10:52,339
What's taking so long? 
 Is this the supervisor?

683
01:10:53,506 --> 01:10:56,134
What do you mean 
 my credit card is no good?

684
01:10:56,593 --> 01:10:59,053
Well, you must have 
 the wrong number.

685
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:02,683
No, it's 8-4-6-8.

686
01:11:09,856 --> 01:11:11,024
That's good.

687
01:11:12,233 --> 01:11:14,944
I think you've been a bad girl...

688
01:11:15,903 --> 01:11:19,324
...and I want to spank you 
 with my ruler.

689
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:22,953
Oh, yes, that's nice.

690
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:24,621
That is nice.

691
01:11:27,248 --> 01:11:28,500
Now I'm hot.

692
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,627
I'm hot.

693
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:35,591
You got me so hot, it's like 
 I can feel you touching me.

694
01:11:39,803 --> 01:11:42,013
I can feel you touching me.

695
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,084
Bingo!

696
01:12:24,097 --> 01:12:26,390
Come on! We got to find Anton!

697
01:12:27,684 --> 01:12:29,352
And kick his ass!

698
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:50,749
Are you Anton?

699
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,877
If you're a teacher, 
 we'll discuss my attendance later--

700
01:12:54,085 --> 01:12:56,129
I found you! 
 My name is Debi LeCure.

701
01:12:56,379 --> 01:12:58,756
I know what's happening. 
 I could stop it.

702
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:00,508
Really, how?

703
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:03,845
Die!

704
01:13:15,982 --> 01:13:17,233
Yeah, fuck him up, Debi!

705
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:20,821
The host of evil must die!

706
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:28,244
Isn't that knife 
 a little extreme, kitten?

707
01:13:40,715 --> 01:13:45,511
You're not going anywhere, evil-hosting 
 fuck-stick. Nobody touches my Ford!

708
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:46,804
Come on, Debi.

709
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:47,972
Give him what for.

710
01:13:48,306 --> 01:13:49,807
Wait, wait! I'm not a host.

711
01:13:50,141 --> 01:13:51,309
Okay, look.

712
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,687
The evil was in my hand, all right?

713
01:13:55,814 --> 01:13:57,482
I cut it off. Okay?

714
01:13:59,484 --> 01:14:00,235
Oh, shit!

715
01:14:00,485 --> 01:14:01,819
You let it loose?

716
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,863
That was probably a mistake.

717
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:07,241
No kidding. And now it's 
 after my girlfriend.

718
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:09,285
-You got a girlfriend? 
 - I gotta stop it.

719
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:12,372
-It's out for blood. 
 -That ain't all it's out for.

720
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:15,542
If your girl's the one it's after, 
 then at midnight...

721
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:17,502
...it's taking her to hell.

722
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:19,253
Hell?

723
01:14:20,671 --> 01:14:23,382
It's not even 9:00 yet. 
 We got some time.

724
01:14:24,675 --> 01:14:25,509
It's actually...

725
01:14:26,802 --> 01:14:29,806
...six minutes till midnight, 
 druid time.

726
01:14:30,724 --> 01:14:32,142
Druid time.

727
01:14:32,475 --> 01:14:33,309
Right.

728
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,394
Let's go!

729
01:14:43,152 --> 01:14:44,236
Oh, God!

730
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:45,906
That's disgusting.

731
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:49,409
Come on, man. You're dead.

732
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:52,662
You know, think about it. 
 It's illegal.

733
01:15:17,311 --> 01:15:18,896
Move! Look out!

734
01:15:24,777 --> 01:15:27,572
Everybody, go home! 
 There's a psycho killer here!

735
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:40,752
I cut off my hand, 
 and it'll kill you all.

736
01:15:41,002 --> 01:15:42,503
Get off the stage!

737
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,634
It's true. 
 His hand killed us yesterday.

738
01:15:48,926 --> 01:15:51,220
Yeah, it sliced me up real good.

739
01:15:51,637 --> 01:15:54,014
-Molly, you out there? 
 -Get out of here, kid!

740
01:15:55,683 --> 01:15:58,311
You had your fun! 
 Now it's time--

741
01:16:08,821 --> 01:16:09,822
Shit!

742
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,143
-God! Did you see that thing? 
 - I have to get Anton!

743
01:16:39,393 --> 01:16:42,521
No, screw him! 
 I mean, he'll be fine!

744
01:16:44,773 --> 01:16:45,774
Come on!

745
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:49,570
In there?

746
01:16:49,821 --> 01:16:53,241
You want to stay out here and 
 get killed as you're trampled?

747
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,498
I was going to get some.

748
01:17:02,374 --> 01:17:04,335
I really doubt it.

749
01:17:11,425 --> 01:17:13,969
Pnub's a lot more creative 
 than I thought.

750
01:17:14,178 --> 01:17:16,388
l mean, he's actually kind of cool.

751
01:17:16,722 --> 01:17:19,433
-He had that costume-- 
 -Maybe we should go faster.

752
01:17:19,683 --> 01:17:21,352
I don't know if he did it or--

753
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:23,396
-Wait, wait! 
 -What, what--?

754
01:17:25,898 --> 01:17:26,816
Go!

755
01:17:36,658 --> 01:17:39,037
Oh, shit! We're trapped in here!

756
01:17:39,329 --> 01:17:41,873
-It's going to get me! 
 -It's not going to get you!

757
01:17:42,123 --> 01:17:44,083
It's not going to get you!

758
01:17:48,629 --> 01:17:51,840
We can't go through the blade! 
 We'll be pulverized!

759
01:17:52,091 --> 01:17:53,509
Give me your shoe!

760
01:18:23,956 --> 01:18:25,791
What are you going to do?

761
01:18:28,293 --> 01:18:31,005
No, no. 
 Oh, God, it's too far!

762
01:18:31,255 --> 01:18:33,216
I can't drop that far!

763
01:18:34,217 --> 01:18:35,635
We'll die in this vent!

764
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:37,720
-We won't die. 
 -We'll die here.

765
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:41,807
The rats are gonna eat us, 
 and nobody's gonna find us.

766
01:18:44,059 --> 01:18:45,435
Okay, we're good.

767
01:18:49,482 --> 01:18:51,692
-Be careful. 
 -All right, let's go!

768
01:18:58,324 --> 01:19:01,451
This would be more comfortable 
 if your ass wasn't so wide.

769
01:19:01,702 --> 01:19:03,912
-This is dumb. 
 -Anton needs our help.

770
01:19:04,162 --> 01:19:07,333
The best thing about being dead 
 is zero responsibility.

771
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:09,960
That's Tanya. Let's save her. 
 Come on!

772
01:19:11,796 --> 01:19:15,299
-Hurry up. She needs me. 
 -She needs you like a fish needs--

773
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:22,140
Okay, this sucks.

774
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:30,022
Grab the cord and come down!

775
01:19:30,689 --> 01:19:33,484
I can't. I can't. I'm scared!

776
01:19:33,984 --> 01:19:35,652
Do it, Tanya! Come on!

777
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:37,738
I can't. It's here.

778
01:19:37,988 --> 01:19:39,657
It's in here. I know it.

779
01:19:41,033 --> 01:19:42,827
Why'd you pull the rope up?

780
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:45,704
I didn't pull the rope up.

781
01:19:48,874 --> 01:19:51,001
Tanya, where are you? 
 I can't see you!

782
01:19:51,668 --> 01:19:53,337
Tanya, talk to me, please!

783
01:19:53,587 --> 01:19:55,088
Just jump! Just jump!

784
01:19:59,802 --> 01:20:02,096
Tanya, grab the rope!

785
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:04,348
Get it off!

786
01:20:37,172 --> 01:20:40,926
I'm not going through all this Tanya. 
 Go back that way.

787
01:20:42,344 --> 01:20:44,888
-Now you really won't get any. 
 -It's unfair.

788
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,807
You can go back if you want 
 to get a piece.

789
01:21:19,631 --> 01:21:21,132
Fucking hand, I got you now!

790
01:22:00,297 --> 01:22:01,674
Who's your daddy now, bitch?

791
01:22:02,966 --> 01:22:04,134
Who's your fucking--

792
01:22:07,512 --> 01:22:09,431
We're here for you. 
 Don't worry.

793
01:22:11,808 --> 01:22:13,518
- I made that ashtray! 
 -Really?

794
01:22:13,768 --> 01:22:15,104
You let it go again!

795
01:22:15,604 --> 01:22:16,438
Fuck you, then.

796
01:22:16,689 --> 01:22:18,315
Fine, then! You know what?

797
01:22:18,565 --> 01:22:20,359
You aren't crashing at my house.

798
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:22,069
Did you guys hear that?

799
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,867
Help! Help!

800
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:35,916
Help me!

801
01:22:45,008 --> 01:22:47,010
Bet she wins Best Costume.

802
01:22:47,844 --> 01:22:48,928
Help me!

803
01:22:52,808 --> 01:22:54,143
The hand's raising the car!

804
01:22:56,103 --> 01:22:57,354
Help me!

805
01:22:58,897 --> 01:23:00,899
Don't worry. We got it under control!

806
01:23:01,149 --> 01:23:02,484
The fucker's got a grip.

807
01:23:09,033 --> 01:23:10,492
Hurry, please!

808
01:23:16,832 --> 01:23:20,126
Those auto-shop boys 
 are true artistes.

809
01:23:22,087 --> 01:23:23,881
It's Mighty Joe Bong!

810
01:23:25,591 --> 01:23:26,675
I need me spinach.

811
01:23:31,096 --> 01:23:32,347
I made that.

812
01:23:32,681 --> 01:23:35,642
The ashtray, I'd almost believe. 
 But this? No way.

813
01:23:40,438 --> 01:23:42,816
Molly's about to get squished, 
 you bastards!

814
01:23:43,108 --> 01:23:45,569
This is important. For strength.

815
01:23:57,872 --> 01:23:59,124
There you go.

816
01:24:00,959 --> 01:24:02,794
Now you're taking Anton-time.

817
01:24:03,587 --> 01:24:07,174
You're getting stoned with 
 your friends? Unbelievable!

818
01:24:39,956 --> 01:24:41,875
That's some one-hit shit there!

819
01:24:43,209 --> 01:24:44,044
Don't worry.

820
01:24:44,627 --> 01:24:45,462
I'll get you down.

821
01:25:12,531 --> 01:25:13,365
That's it?

822
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,370
That's it? 
 No explosions, no hellfire, no--?

823
01:25:20,455 --> 01:25:21,831
I'm glad everyone's all right.

824
01:25:22,081 --> 01:25:23,791
But that was weak.

825
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:26,336
Well, my work here is done.

826
01:25:26,587 --> 01:25:29,381
Time for the ritualistic sex. 
 You coming?

827
01:25:30,632 --> 01:25:32,717
You are a pistol.

828
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:37,013
Hello? I'm still up here.

829
01:25:40,308 --> 01:25:41,559
Thanks, Mick.

830
01:25:42,853 --> 01:25:44,104
You're a bud.

831
01:26:00,787 --> 01:26:01,872
Come here.

832
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,218
As usual...

833
01:26:15,468 --> 01:26:18,847
...marijuana saves 
 an otherwise disastrous day.

834
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:27,230
I never got a hit. Light me.

835
01:26:37,699 --> 01:26:39,284
Sweet Jesus!

836
01:26:39,534 --> 01:26:41,036
That wasn't my fault!

837
01:26:41,286 --> 01:26:43,997
That thing should've come down 
 a lot slower!

838
01:26:54,841 --> 01:26:56,301
What the hell.

839
01:26:56,509 --> 01:26:57,761
Don't forget my bong.

840
01:26:58,011 --> 01:27:00,013
You did not make that bong.

841
01:27:00,263 --> 01:27:01,264
I arc welded it.

842
01:27:01,514 --> 01:27:02,682
You don't take auto shop.

843
01:27:02,932 --> 01:27:04,392
Fuck you!

844
01:27:06,018 --> 01:27:07,687
You coming, Anton?

845
01:27:23,452 --> 01:27:25,037
I can't even believe it.

846
01:27:25,288 --> 01:27:27,749
You blew off heaven 
 to kick it with me.

847
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:29,042
You are the coolest.

848
01:27:29,251 --> 01:27:32,754
You taking care of me 
 beats the shit out of heaven.

849
01:27:33,004 --> 01:27:33,838
Really?

850
01:27:38,176 --> 01:27:39,677
Time for your meds.

851
01:27:48,144 --> 01:27:50,438
Guys! You blew off heaven too?

852
01:27:50,772 --> 01:27:53,149
No, we're your guardian angels.

853
01:27:54,484 --> 01:27:57,403
Poor thing has delirium. 
 Visiting hours are over.

854
01:28:00,699 --> 01:28:02,534
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

855
01:28:09,082 --> 01:28:11,542
So the deal is, 
 we're supposed to monitor you...

856
01:28:11,793 --> 01:28:14,503
...and make sure you don't revert 
 to your evil ways.

857
01:28:14,712 --> 01:28:16,547
But you seem fine now.

858
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:20,218
Let's hit the Snack Master in the hall. 
 You want anything?

859
01:28:20,468 --> 01:28:22,846
Get me Crunch Nuggets. 
 They're awesome.

860
01:28:27,058 --> 01:28:28,810
Thanks, you guys.

861
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:33,856
Hit the light.

862
01:28:43,241 --> 01:28:46,119
Mick! Pnub! 
 Come guardian me!

863
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:54,669
You're right. 
 Anton screams like a girl.

864
01:28:55,003 --> 01:28:57,547
Think we should tell him 
 we painted that?

865
01:28:58,464 --> 01:29:00,591
Fuck it. 
 Let's go walk through a nurse.

866
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,177
Watch it! Some of them are guys.
