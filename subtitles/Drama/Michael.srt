00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:10,141
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

2
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,143
¶ heaven is my home ¶

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,444
¶ ooh ooh ¶

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,646
¶ heaven is my home ¶

5
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,180
¶ ooh ooh ooh ¶

6
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:20,783
¶ now this sweet world
is precious to me ¶

7
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:22,718
¶ ooh ¶

8
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:37,964
¶ I have traveled
down this road before ¶

9
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:41,801
¶ on a journey for a friend ¶

10
00:00:41,803 --> 00:00:46,237
¶ been away,
but now I'm back for more ¶

11
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,605
¶ going down this road again ¶

12
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,376
¶ you know
he answers every prayer ¶

13
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:58,646
¶ but you better do your part ¶

14
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:02,516
¶ his spirit's
all around you everywhere ¶

15
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:05,385
¶ but you gotta open up
your heart ¶

16
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:09,755
¶ you've gotta open up
your heart ¶

17
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:21,532
¶ you're alone when
you come in this world ¶

18
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:24,535
¶ you're alone when you go ¶

19
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:29,673
¶ and it doesn't matter
who you are ¶

20
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:33,543
¶ doesn't matter who you know ¶

21
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:38,514
¶ keep on listening
for that choir, boys ¶

22
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,516
¶ that's the way to start ¶

23
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:46,154
¶ the door is open,
but you have a choice ¶

24
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:48,822
¶ you've got to open up
your heart ¶

25
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,959
¶ you've gotta open up
your heart ¶

26
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:02,734
¶ oh, this world
is dear to me ¶

27
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:06,303
¶ heaven is my home ¶

28
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,507
¶ this is where I long to be ¶

29
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:14,942
¶ heaven is my home ¶

30
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:19,378
¶ when your life seems gloomy ¶

31
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:23,848
¶ teardrops start to fall ¶

32
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:28,985
¶ send the word back to me ¶

33
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:31,320
¶ that I'll be there ¶

34
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:33,855
¶ when you call ¶

35
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:38,492
¶ I've been down
this road before ¶

36
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:41,327
¶ heaven is my home ¶

37
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,930
¶ not coming back here ¶

38
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,398
¶ anymore ¶

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,067
¶ heaven is my home ¶

40
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,568
¶ yeah ¶

41
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,871
¶ heaven is my home ¶

42
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:23,097
Good night now.

43
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,498
Good night.

44
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:06,404
¶ Sleigh bells ring ¶

45
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:08,506
¶ are you listening? ¶

46
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,407
¶ in the land ¶

47
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,909
¶ snow is glistening ¶

48
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,543
¶ a beautiful sight ¶

49
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,645
¶ we're happy tonight ¶

50
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:19,447
¶ walking in
a winter wonderland... ¶

51
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,048
Right here is fine.

52
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,816
Think this is bleak enough?

53
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:26,485
My ears are frozen,
my feet are frozen.

54
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:28,286
This is as far as it goes.

55
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:30,721
Malt's not going to like this.

56
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:32,489
What's he not going to like?

57
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:34,290
He'll find something not to like.

58
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,758
Besides us, you mean?

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,626
Yes, besides us.

60
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:39,127
Huey...

61
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:40,428
You sit in the sled.

62
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:47,301
Santa, Sparky, presents...

63
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:48,468
Reindeer...

64
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,770
Fake snow...
What are we missing?

65
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:51,771
Children.

66
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:53,839
Oh, yeah.

67
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,073
Let them out!

68
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:56,907
Let them out!

69
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:03,346
Now what do I do?

70
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,514
You know what to do.

71
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:09,050
When they handed out the parts,
you got the heart.

72
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:10,718
That's right, I got the heart.

73
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
You got the brain.
Is that what you're saying?

74
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:16,690
I'm saying that between the two of us,
you've got the heart.

75
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm saying that together,
we make a person.

76
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:21,261
It's Santa!

77
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:22,862
It's Sparky!

78
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:25,063
¶ And we're walking ¶

79
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:27,464
¶ In a winter ¶

80
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:32,635
¶ wonderla-a-and ¶

81
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:38,607
What is this, Craddock, a joke?

82
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:39,407
No.

83
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,409
Who was in charge here?

84
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,743
Me. I was.

85
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:44,344
That's right, mr. Malt.
This was Quinlan's baby.

86
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,079
Quinlan...

87
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:47,380
Let me ask you a question.

88
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:50,716
You was a big-shot
investigative reporter

89
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,217
for the<i> Chicago Tribune.</i>

90
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,851
Won some prizes.

91
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,254
Give him a biscuit.

92
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:01,757
Now, what do these
look like to you?

93
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,925
They're Indians dressed up as eskimos.

94
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,661
Indians, eskimos...
What's the difference?

95
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:07,928
That's what we thought.

96
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,829
Shut up, Driscoll.

97
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:12,331
You know the only prize
I ever got, Quinlan?

98
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,499
It's out there on the walls.

99
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:18,002
I got 4.5 million people

100
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,637
who buy the<i> National Mirror</i> every week.

101
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,374
Do you know how many of
those 4 1/2 million readers

102
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:27,276
are Indians or eskimos
or eskimo-Indians?

103
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,044
I told him. American children.

104
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:32,514
Americans want to see
pictures of Americans.

105
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,048
They are Americans.

106
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,885
Americans! Is that too much
to ask for Christmas?

107
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:42,655
No, sir, and I will
get someone right on it.

108
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:44,890
Aw, did you do that again?

109
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,495
If you don't teach
that dog some manners soon,

110
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,597
somebody else
is going to have to,

111
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,165
won't they, hmm?

112
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,800
How long were you in
Elizabeth Taylor's pool, ma'am?

113
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:59,803
Reincarnation.
Miss Uffler speaking.

114
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,238
Were you on the bed
when it levitated?

115
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,007
So you're saying
he's living in your refrigerator?

116
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,641
Uh-huh.

117
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,376
Uh-huh.
You know what?

118
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,311
Can I put you on
hold for a second?

119
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,213
I'm going to go to my desk
and take this call there.

120
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:14,414
Yes. Now, don't let him out.

121
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,082
Ok. Hold on.

122
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,433
Oh.

123
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:35,834
Oh, no, no, no.

124
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,935
Here's something interesting.

125
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:42,639
Ay yi yi.

126
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:50,712
Malt sent you for the tree this year,
didn't he? I forgot.

127
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:52,313
I found it in Montana.

128
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:54,114
Now, the second
I see this tree,

129
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:57,083
I know that it's too big
to fit on the truck.

130
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,552
Then I think, what if someone else
sees the same tree

131
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:01,520
while I'm out trying
to find something

132
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,089
that will fit on the truck?

133
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:05,323
Then Malt...

134
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:08,959
Gets the second biggest
Christmas tree in America,

135
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,393
and I'm screwed.

136
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:12,261
Yeah, well, that's good thinking.

137
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:14,062
So I cut the top off.

138
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:15,563
You did that?

139
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:17,998
How was I supposed to know
it was going to be such a major problem

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,367
to put the top part of the tree
back on the bottom?

141
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,469
He is never going
to fire you, Huey.

142
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:26,606
Look at the walls.
Look, look at the walls.

143
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,742
He's got millions of dollars
tied up in that dog,

144
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,745
and the dog belongs to you.

145
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:35,180
Hold on to that dog, Huey.

146
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,821
What?

147
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,889
Driscoll?
Driscoll!

148
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:48,624
Driscoll!
Come in here!

149
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:52,995
We're going together, Sparky.

150
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:59,834
"Dear mr. Quinlan, I'm a great
admirer of your... prose

151
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:02,469
"and can tell you have
a sensitive nature.

152
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:08,874
"I have had an angel
named... Michael...

153
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:11,610
"Living with me for almost 6 months now.

154
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:13,878
"He's extremely polite.

155
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,580
"I have enclosed a photograph to prove to you

156
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:20,150
"that I have not lost my wits.

157
00:09:20,152 --> 00:09:23,019
"I know that you and Sparky travel all over

158
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,487
"reporting on your stories.

159
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:26,889
"That one about the coconut
with the wedding ring inside

160
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:30,025
"was very, very nice,

161
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,960
and I think you should visit Iowa..."

162
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:38,298
"And see us for yourself.

163
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,001
Sincerely, Pansy Milbank."

164
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:45,370
Mm-hmm.

165
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,038
Yeah.

166
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,640
Did your mother drop you?

167
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:53,310
What was going on
in that pea brain

168
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:58,280
that lets you take this superb creation
of the lord almighty

169
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:00,215
and chop it in half?!

170
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:02,584
Whatever I'm paying you,
it's too much!

171
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,018
How much does Fred make?

172
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,953
What, the janitor?
Oh, mr. Malt,

173
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,655
I cannot survive on a janitor's salary...

174
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:09,989
Kill the dog.

175
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:11,357
Quinlan, did someone
invite you to this meeting?

176
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:13,459
Take him outside
and let him go on the highway.

177
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:14,460
Wait a minute...

178
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:15,794
what kind of person are you?

179
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:17,162
Who is this?

180
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:19,464
This is miss Dorothy Winters.
She works here.

181
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,098
I do?
I got the job?

182
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,667
Yes! You won't regret this, mr. Malt.

183
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:28,171
Do you know what that is?

184
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:32,408
That is an angel.

185
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,543
That is a genuine angel.

186
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:37,579
Huey discovered it.

187
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:39,180
Is this for real?

188
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:40,948
Absolutely.

189
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,116
You're going to go
get me this angel.

190
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:46,486
That's exactly
what we're going to do.

191
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,955
We'll put it on the front page, bold.

192
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:51,556
Some white fluffy clouds...

193
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:53,591
There you go.

194
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:55,192
A drift of sky...

195
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:56,426
You got it.

196
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:57,827
And some musical notes!

197
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,028
Yeah. Yeah.

198
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,029
Yeah!

199
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:00,829
Poetry.

200
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:02,497
Don't play with me, Quinlan.

201
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:07,168
You really are going to go
and fetch me this angel for Christmas,

202
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,738
or... I fire the two of you,

203
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,307
and I keep the dog. Yeah?

204
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,274
Deal.

205
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,576
A little conference with my colleague.

206
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:19,711
You cannot live on Fred's salary.

207
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,712
You cannot.

208
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,080
That's a deal.

209
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,882
Don't you worry about a thing, mr. Malt.

210
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,950
We'll leave tomorrow.

211
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,986
We're taking Sparky with us.

212
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:31,754
And you're taking miss Winters.

213
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:32,821
They are?

214
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:34,255
Why are we taking her?

215
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:35,289
She's an expert.

216
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,290
In what?

217
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,058
Angels.

218
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,594
Miss Winters is
an expert in angels.

219
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:46,631
I have something to tell you.

220
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,432
I won't be taking care of you anymore.

221
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:51,868
Your parents will find
someone else and...

222
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,669
Stop looking at me like that.

223
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,304
I have this wonderful new job.

224
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:59,106
The only problem is, I have to pretend
to be an angel expert

225
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:01,241
for a few days on this trip.

226
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:03,343
It'll be fine.

227
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:05,678
I'll be fine.

228
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,613
And so will you.

229
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:09,615
Good dogs.

230
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,283
Good dogs.

231
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,600
Have you ever had
an encounter with an angel?

232
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:08,601
No.

233
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:09,802
Yes.

234
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:10,803
Maybe.

235
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,371
Have you ever met an angel?

236
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:13,605
Yeah, once.

237
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:15,039
I got a flat tire

238
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,874
on the side of a deserted country road.

239
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,442
There was no food, no water,

240
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:19,776
108 degrees temperature,

241
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:22,678
and a man in a white robe

242
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,146
suddenly appeared
on the horizon

243
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:26,681
with a spare and a jack.

244
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:27,815
You're kidding.

245
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:29,383
Yes, I am.

246
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:31,251
Bradley used to tease.

247
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:32,752
Who is Bradley?

248
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,420
My ex-husband.

249
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:38,056
Oh, ho.
You better watch it, Quinlan.

250
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,757
I think we should start over.

251
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,091
You know, when something
isn't going well,

252
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:42,692
it's best just to start over.

253
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:43,759
I'll go first.

254
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,760
Ok.

255
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:46,194
Where'd you get Sparky?

256
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:47,328
Oh, no.

257
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,730
He comes up to Huey
in a parking lot one day.

258
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,231
Huey was eating a donut,

259
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,733
and he's trying to kick the...
trying to kick him away.

260
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:56,268
You were trying
to kick the dog?

261
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,103
I wasn't trying to kick him.

262
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,172
I was trying to shoo
him away very gently.

263
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,775
When Malt comes out the door,
he looks at the dog,

264
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,009
he stops dead in his tracks.

265
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:09,311
It turns out that Malt
was once a child

266
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:11,713
who had had a dog
just like that one.

267
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:14,916
Oh, that's so sweet.

268
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:17,785
Anyway, Malt's eyes get all teary,

269
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:21,388
and he pours out this story
all about his dog Sparky,

270
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,924
which ended up underneath a tractor tire!

271
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,625
Ha ha ha!

272
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:28,326
And you know what Huey did?

273
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:29,593
Huey turns to Malt,
and he says,

274
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:31,695
"Mr. Malt, that is amazing!

275
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:34,330
This dog's name is Sparky, too!"

276
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,799
Ha ha ha!

277
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:40,002
In no time at all,
the dog is famous.

278
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,336
He's got his own column.

279
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,438
He must've saved Huey's neck
a hundred times.

280
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:46,340
Milk bottle hotel.
Here, here, here!

281
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:47,341
Milk bottle hotel!

282
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:05,449
Looks like your angel checked out.

283
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:12,087
Somebody's here.

284
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,699
Mrs. Milbank?

285
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:32,436
Mrs. Milbank,
I'm Frank Quinlan

286
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:35,605
from the<i> National Mirror.</i>

287
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:38,307
About your letter?

288
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:39,274
Um...

289
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:42,410
This is my associate mr. Hugh Driscoll.

290
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:43,677
H-how are you?

291
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,845
And this is Dorothy Winters,

292
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:49,648
who is an expert in... various things.

293
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,449
And this is...

294
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:53,583
Sparky.

295
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,253
Oh! Oh!

296
00:16:58,255 --> 00:17:03,957
Oh, you're just as handsome
as in the pictures!

297
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:04,958
Aww...

298
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,893
Oh, I think he's cold.

299
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:07,960
I wouldn't know why not.

300
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:11,229
We better get him inside.
Oh...

301
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,502
Sparky, here you are.

302
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:21,203
Oh, ha ha!

303
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:24,372
Mmm. What's that
wonderful smell?

304
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:26,240
You must be baking.

305
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:34,980
Well, it was nice
of you to come.

306
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,531
Ohh!

307
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,433
Mrs. Milbank?

308
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:03,005
Don't shake me, mr. Quinlan!

309
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:05,474
I'm contemplating my death.

310
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:08,243
Are you with the angel?

311
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:15,615
Do you see an angel?

312
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,417
I don't think I do.

313
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,719
Then how could I be with him?

314
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:25,623
Well, we don't know exactly
how it works with angels.

315
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,890
"How it works"?

316
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:32,128
If he's in the room,
then you're with him.

317
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,729
If he's somewhere else,

318
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:35,163
then you're not.

319
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:38,132
And that's why we
can't see him now.

320
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:40,000
He's not here.

321
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:45,304
Are you impaired in some way
that I haven't noticed, miss?

322
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:47,606
Miss Winters has
probably never heard

323
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,275
of an angel living in a motel.

324
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:52,043
Ha ha ha!

325
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,978
You think I'm full of shit.

326
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,846
No, no, nothing like that.

327
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,381
I don't judge these things, mrs. Milbank.

328
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:00,816
It's not for me to decide
what's real and what's not.

329
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:02,784
I've seen too many things myself.

330
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:06,720
We once heard there was
a werewolf in South Jersey.

331
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:07,887
We went there.

332
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:09,188
To locate the, uh, werewolf.

333
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,723
Yeah. In that particular case,

334
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:13,524
that person was...

335
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:17,060
Utterly convinced that the werewolf
was in the room with us.

336
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:20,163
They could see it, although
mr. Quinlan and myself...

337
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:21,464
We couldn't see the werewolf,

338
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:23,666
but that doesn't mean
it wasn't there.

339
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:25,300
Michael!

340
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:30,238
Michael? Are you coming down, dear?

341
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,673
Yeah...

342
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:34,474
Be right down.

343
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:36,476
Just gotta find my smokes.

344
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:40,346
They're beside the bed,
next to my cortisone.

345
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:42,815
Did you find them?

346
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:45,551
He'll be down directly.

347
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,953
That smell is so familiar.

348
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,822
It's like something
from childhood.

349
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:19,880
Ohh...

350
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:34,627
Michael, look who's come to visit us.

351
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,061
It's Sparky.

352
00:20:50,443 --> 00:20:52,443
How do you do?

353
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:13,529
You'll have to excuse Michael.

354
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:15,864
He's not good at suffering fools,

355
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:19,067
but he'll be better in the morning.

356
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:43,456
It's freezing!

357
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,059
Whoa!

358
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:51,495
Where is the thermostat in here?

359
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:53,463
Are we talking
about an angel here?

360
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:55,364
We can't be talking
about an angel.

361
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:56,765
There is no...

362
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:58,867
Such thing such thing as an angel.
As an angel.

363
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:01,469
That is definitely the weirdest thing
I have ever seen.

364
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:03,337
It's like some great big bird

365
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:04,705
made love to that guy's mother.

366
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:08,108
Yes! And we... we reap the benefits!

367
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,509
I'm set for life!

368
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:11,210
I mean, I could even get a raise!

369
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:13,312
I thank you!
Thank you, Jesus!

370
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:14,479
¶ Thank you, Jesus ¶

371
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:15,613
¶ I thank you, Jesus ¶

372
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:17,648
¶ I thank you, Jesus ¶

373
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:21,351
¶ thank you, Jesus,
thank you, Jesus, I thank you, Jesus ¶

374
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:24,987
¶ I thank you, jes... ¶

375
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:26,121
What?

376
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:27,822
That is not an angel.

377
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:29,290
It is too!

378
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,758
It is not!

379
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:34,761
I will handle this.

380
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:38,931
Where... has he been?

381
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:39,865
Meaning what?

382
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:42,400
Meaning if he were
a man with wings,

383
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,235
which is the alternative here,

384
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,502
we would've heard about him.

385
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,203
He didn't just show up
at his age with wings.

386
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:50,139
There would've been a story
about him in the papers.

387
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:51,240
In the<i> National Mirror.</i>

388
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:53,675
Exactly. "Baby born with wings."

389
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:55,710
Yeah, "Birdman of Iowa."

390
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:58,112
It is not angel vs. man with wings.

391
00:22:58,114 --> 00:22:59,980
There are other possibilities.

392
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:01,614
Like what?

393
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:05,317
It's fairly obvious, isn't it?

394
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,119
He's a younger man.
She's an older woman.

395
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,553
He's after her money.

396
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,255
A gigolo with wings?

397
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,256
A gigolo!

398
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,824
What money is he after?

399
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,526
The milk bottle motel fortune?

400
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:18,960
You don't have to have money

401
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:22,129
to have someone try
to take it away from you.

402
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:24,498
Lord! Oh...

403
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,066
Is it so hard for you to imagine

404
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:29,468
that a man would be
after a woman's money?

405
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,002
Is this, uh,

406
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:33,004
is this Britely or Brinkley
or whatever, what's his name?

407
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:34,038
Bradley.

408
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,639
Is this Bradley we're
talking about here?

409
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:37,040
Actually, no.
It's Myles.

410
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,074
Who's Myles?

411
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:39,275
My second husband.

412
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:40,276
Ah.

413
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:42,144
Myles was a wild man.

414
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:43,345
It only lasted a week.

415
00:23:43,347 --> 00:23:44,646
You left him?

416
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:47,248
No. He left me in my Camaro.

417
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,783
Ahh!

418
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:51,184
I see.

419
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:52,952
I'll bet he racked up $5,000

420
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:54,753
on your visa bill, too, didn't he?

421
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:55,787
Didn't he?

422
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:58,456
Oh, you just know everything, don't you?

423
00:24:00,193 --> 00:24:02,026
Angels don't smoke!

424
00:24:03,963 --> 00:24:05,228
I'm going to sleep.

425
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,029
Good night.

426
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,566
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

427
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,834
That is a horrible expression.

428
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,738
It is not... an expression.

429
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:54,603
Ooh, is that good?

430
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:56,504
Oh... Ha ha!

431
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:58,939
You're so hungry.
Ha ha!

432
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:04,410
Ok... Ha ha!

433
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:07,179
Aww... Ha!

434
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:08,613
Good boy.

435
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:12,216
Oh, what a sweet doggy.

436
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:14,284
Ha ha ha!

437
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,754
How would you like your eggs,
mr. Quinlan?

438
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:20,355
Oh, Sparky's look good.

439
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:22,156
Over easy!

440
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:40,573
You know, last night
we were discussing your wings.

441
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:43,876
Would you mind if
I took a closer look?

442
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:46,545
Let them look at your wings, Michael.

443
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,480
They're from the<i> National Mirror.</i>

444
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:50,048
Thank you.

445
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:53,851
They're not bad.
Compared to what?

446
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,385
Well, I've...
I've seen birds.

447
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:59,222
Would you mind if I touched... oh!

448
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,590
I'd rather you didn't.

449
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,358
Hey, well...

450
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,359
Ha ha!

451
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,626
We'd just like to take a look

452
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:07,095
to see how you have
these things attached.

453
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:09,363
Why don't you pull on your pecker

454
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:10,764
and see how that's attached?

455
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:13,233
Watch your language, mister.

456
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:14,367
Pecker.

457
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:16,369
An angel that says "pecker."

458
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:19,672
Language, gentlemen!

459
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:21,640
And how would you like your eggs, miss?

460
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:23,508
Is there something in the oven

461
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,942
that smells so delicious?

462
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:27,544
We are serving eggs this morning,
and that's that.

463
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,313
Over easy would be just fine.

464
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:32,415
Over easy!

465
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,251
I thought angels were...

466
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:37,252
Cleaner.

467
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,687
She doesn't mean to offend.

468
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:40,821
It's...

469
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:43,390
Miss Winters is an angel expert,

470
00:26:43,392 --> 00:26:44,991
and she gets kind of...

471
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:45,958
Literal.

472
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,326
What she probably
wants to know is...

473
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,929
Can you fly?

474
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:53,397
I do not want to know if he can fly.

475
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:54,798
I know he can't fly.

476
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,299
Only little angels can fly
because their wingspan...

477
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:57,633
Says who?

478
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:59,534
I just thought...

479
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:00,601
Halos?
Yes.

480
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:02,502
Inner light?
Yes.

481
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:05,705
I'm not that kind of angel.

482
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,440
What kind of angel are you?

483
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:09,708
Michael is an archangel.

484
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,109
He battled Lucifer

485
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:14,011
and threw him out of heaven.

486
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:15,912
<i>Revelation</i> 12, verse 7.

487
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:17,647
That was a long time ago.

488
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:20,616
He smote a bank for me!

489
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:22,150
A bank?

490
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:24,218
I knew it. Money was involved, wasn't it?

491
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,687
Oh, I should say so.

492
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:28,221
After Elmer died...

493
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:29,255
Who's Elmer?

494
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:30,556
My husband.

495
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,025
After he died,
they built the highway

496
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,727
and stole all my truckers.

497
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:40,764
And then the bank came
to take the milk bottle,

498
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:44,566
and I prayed for help

499
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:47,035
until God sent me Michael.

500
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:49,470
Well, she was persistent.

501
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:51,772
You came... down...

502
00:27:51,774 --> 00:27:53,106
and smote the bank?

503
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:54,507
Eh, a branch.

504
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:55,875
First Iowa bank of commerce.

505
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,276
It was lovely.

506
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:59,678
He walked into the manager's
office and said...

507
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,513
what was that you said?

508
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:02,747
Moneychanger!

509
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,949
Moneychanger!

510
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:07,484
I shall turneth this earthly den

511
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,386
into a parking lot!

512
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,653
Come on.
Did I say that?

513
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:12,920
I didn't say that.

514
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:14,521
They didn't believe us,

515
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:16,256
so Michael flattened it.

516
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:17,657
You did that?

517
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:18,658
Had to.

518
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,059
Into a parking lot?

519
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:23,228
Well, they said
it was a tornado.

520
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,931
This town doesn't really
need a parking lot,

521
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:32,068
but it's, uh, more, uh... cosmopolitan.

522
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,003
And what about the money?

523
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:37,139
We never heard another
word about it, did we?

524
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:38,340
Nope.

525
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:42,710
You look like you must eat
a robust breakfast.

526
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:44,478
How would you like your eggs?

527
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,916
Poached?

528
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:53,152
Uh, that's... poached is fine.

529
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:54,819
Poached.

530
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:15,705
The Lord is my shepherd.

531
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:17,106
I shall not want.

532
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:20,342
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

533
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:23,378
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

534
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,312
Look, she's...

535
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:26,981
she's happier where she is, right?

536
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,316
Heaven?

537
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,785
She's happier up there, right?

538
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:35,654
It isn't my area.

539
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:44,728
You hardly knew her.

540
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,263
She died cooking us breakfast.

541
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:52,234
She died making breakfast.

542
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:02,476
What is it that you keep
writing in that book?

543
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:04,344
Lyrics.

544
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,679
To what?

545
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:09,348
I write country-western songs.

546
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,049
It's my hobby.

547
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:13,751
Earth to earth,

548
00:30:13,753 --> 00:30:15,919
ashes to ashes,

549
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,554
dust to dust.

550
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:20,455
The Lord bless and keep you

551
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:22,423
and give you peace.

552
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:25,159
Justine?
It's Quinlan.

553
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:26,627
Put me straight through.

554
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:28,228
What you got?

555
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,696
Wings.

556
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:30,830
Real wings.

557
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:33,165
Don't play with me, Quinlan.

558
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:36,368
This guy is about 6 feet tall,

559
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,435
and his wings

560
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:40,371
reach from his shoulders to his knees.

561
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:41,305
He's filthy, though.

562
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:42,306
We're gonna have to clean him up

563
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,573
and put him in a white robe.

564
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,375
Get Craddock to dig up
some of those sandals.

565
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,443
You know, the ones with those straps
that go up your legs.

566
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:50,912
It's too bad he's not
blond, all right.

567
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:51,979
Angels is supposed to be blond.

568
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:53,413
But<i> Oprah,</i> Barbara,

569
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:56,015
the<i> Today</i> show, <i>Hard copy,</i>

570
00:30:56,017 --> 00:30:57,750
book the works.

571
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,118
Then let's don't mess this one up.

572
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,020
I want that guy on the first plane to Chicago...

573
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:04,355
or does the birdman fly himself?

574
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:08,025
I don't know if he
actually uses the wings,

575
00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:09,793
but, God, wouldn't that be a draw?

576
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:12,462
Anyway, don't worry,
he's in safe hands.

577
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:14,764
Yeah, and I'm the queen of England.

578
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:16,832
Don't fret, Malt.

579
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,035
He's in safe hands.

580
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:22,603
In view of this development,

581
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:23,837
should we call the girl off?

582
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,673
No, no.
Leave her where she is.

583
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:29,075
I'm in a no-lose situation.

584
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:31,310
Heh heh heh heh!

585
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:40,918
Hey ya, Mike.

586
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,319
Michael.

587
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:48,857
Have you, um...

588
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:50,258
Have you ever seen

589
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,860
the world's biggest ball of twine?

590
00:31:52,862 --> 00:31:54,061
No.

591
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:55,429
Listen, we have to get back.

592
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:58,565
I once saw the world's
biggest cannonball.

593
00:31:58,567 --> 00:31:59,699
Mesopotamia.

594
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,333
I wonder if it's still there.

595
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,068
Mesopotamia isn't still there.

596
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,970
Ohh! Nothing lasts.

597
00:32:05,972 --> 00:32:08,806
Listen, I have to ask a favor.

598
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:10,207
Huey and I,

599
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:13,676
we're on a little bit
of a losing streak.

600
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:15,511
Quit.

601
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:16,912
We can't quit.

602
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:18,313
He's got a mortgage.

603
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:20,048
He's got 3 kids in a soccer camp.

604
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,049
He's got a wife.

605
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:22,483
God knows he loves her,

606
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:24,318
but she's burning
a hole in his pocket.

607
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,186
And I...

608
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,620
Well...

609
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:30,288
Love to fight.
Like me.

610
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,555
We'll drive.

611
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:32,722
Where?

612
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:34,757
Chicago. That's where
you want to go, isn't it?

613
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,758
Yes!

614
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,159
Yeah. I know.

615
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:38,360
That's why I wrote you.

616
00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:39,961
<i>You</i> wrote?
I thought...

617
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:41,562
Yeah. My idea.

618
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:42,696
Ah.

619
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:44,097
Why are we driving?

620
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,400
I mean, why don't we fly?

621
00:32:47,402 --> 00:32:49,201
I mean, all of us,

622
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:51,069
together, in a plane.

623
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,670
It's safer, much safer.

624
00:32:52,672 --> 00:32:54,071
Nobody believes it,

625
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:57,574
but, statistically, it's true,

626
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,576
and the paper will pay.

627
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:00,977
Nope. We need time.

628
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,679
Time for what?

629
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:03,813
Smokes.

630
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,814
Smokes. Ah.

631
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,949
Besides... I will get to see

632
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,818
the world's largest ball of twine.

633
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,819
It's on the way.

634
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,153
Great. Great.

635
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:13,621
One one condition:
you will owe me something.

636
00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:16,223
Money. Yeah. I can't quote a figure,

637
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:18,225
but there will be plenty of money,

638
00:33:18,227 --> 00:33:20,360
I promise you that,

639
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:22,595
once the world sees pictures of these babies.

640
00:33:22,597 --> 00:33:24,964
No. You will owe me an apology.

641
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,799
An apology for what?

642
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:28,901
Oh, yeah, sure.
I apologize.

643
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:30,002
Whatever.

644
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:31,737
Not now.
When I say so.

645
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:32,604
And no pictures.

646
00:33:32,606 --> 00:33:35,273
No pictures?
Are you kidding me?

647
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:38,442
Not until we get to Chicago.

648
00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:39,876
Deal?

649
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:41,077
Deal.

650
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,645
Hmm...

651
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,652
I like your coat better.

652
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,687
It's yours.

653
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:18,444
The world's biggest ball of twine

654
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:20,179
is less than 2 hours from here.

655
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:21,680
I would like to see it
before the sun sets.

656
00:34:21,682 --> 00:34:24,282
Michael, they are going to exploit you.

657
00:34:24,284 --> 00:34:26,150
You have to know that.

658
00:34:26,152 --> 00:34:27,151
I'm going.

659
00:34:27,153 --> 00:34:29,953
Well, I'm not, for your sake.

660
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:31,354
Yes, you are,

661
00:34:31,356 --> 00:34:33,622
or I'll have to tell them
the truth about you.

662
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:34,789
What?

663
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,624
I know why you're here,

664
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:39,660
and it has nothing
to do with angels.

665
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,895
How do you know?

666
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:44,497
I pay attention.

667
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,172
Also...

668
00:34:54,174 --> 00:34:55,840
I would like you to sing.

669
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:57,007
A song?
Of course.

670
00:34:57,009 --> 00:35:00,710
Fine. I'll sing.

671
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:01,977
Now?

672
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:03,111
No.

673
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:04,846
When I tell you to.

674
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,931
¶ Hoo! ¶

675
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:28,634
¶ there's a place up ahead,
and I'm goin' ¶

676
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:32,403
¶ just as fast
as my feet can fly ¶

677
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:34,405
¶ come away, come away ¶

678
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:36,073
¶ if you're goin' ¶

679
00:35:36,075 --> 00:35:39,976
¶ leave the sinkin' ship
behind ¶

680
00:35:39,978 --> 00:35:43,112
¶ come on the risin' wind ¶

681
00:35:43,114 --> 00:35:46,915
¶ we're goin' up
around the bend ¶

682
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,983
¶ hoo! ¶

683
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:52,786
¶ bring a song and a smile
for the banjo ¶

684
00:35:52,788 --> 00:35:56,356
¶ better git
while the gittin's good ¶

685
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:00,159

687
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:07,298

688
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,700
¶ we're goin' up
around the bend... ¶

689
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:11,601
In financial news,

690
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:14,370
hog futures are down
1/4 in Chicago

691
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,638
and selling down 1/8 in Sioux City.

692
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,772
Hog futures.

693
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:18,873
Ha ha ha!

694
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:19,974
What?

695
00:36:24,914 --> 00:36:28,582
Hog futures are down 1/4.

696
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,984
Hey. What's
the opposite of white?

697
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:31,985
Black.

698
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:33,586
Wrong. Yolk.

699
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:39,590
What?

700
00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:41,592
What is that,
like, an egg joke?

701
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:43,827
Hey, Michael, when we stop to eat,

702
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,795
are you going to put your coat back on?

703
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:46,796
Why?

704
00:36:46,798 --> 00:36:47,797
Your wings, Michael.

705
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:49,532
People are going
to see your wings.

706
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:52,033
Are you afraid they'll
think less of you?

707
00:36:53,636 --> 00:36:54,735
No.

708
00:36:54,737 --> 00:36:56,703
Just they won't know
what to think, you know?

709
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:59,939
A lot of people aren't
as sophisticated as me and Huey.

710
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,073
Oh.

711
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:02,407
You know, we don't
want any trouble.

712
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:04,275
We just want to get to Chicago.

713
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:05,476
Mm-hmm.

714
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:06,610
He's worried that
somebody will see you

715
00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:08,078
and try to steal his story.

716
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,212
I am not worried.

717
00:37:09,214 --> 00:37:10,379
Yes, you are worried.

718
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:12,948
Hey! Hey!
Look what Pansy left us.

719
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,116
Car bingo.

720
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:17,184
Oh. Dig the propaganda.

721
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:18,585
"The Miles will fly,

722
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:21,254
"and your children won't cry

723
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:22,822

724
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:23,756
Car bingo.

725
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:25,624
All right. Everybody gets one.

726
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,926
Here we go.
Hand them out.

727
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:29,928
So, what do we do?

728
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,195
Here are the pencils.

729
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:32,462
Instead of writing down a number,

730
00:37:32,464 --> 00:37:35,531
you write down what you see on your trip.

731
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:37,866
Ok. Dog. One point for me.

732
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:39,100
No. That's not fair.

733
00:37:39,102 --> 00:37:40,367
You've played this before.

734
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:41,634
It's not fair to me.
I'm driving.

735
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:43,235
Deal with it.
Bird on a wire.

736
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:44,603
Picket fence.

737
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:45,637
Policeman.

738
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,705
Where? Where?

739
00:37:53,846 --> 00:37:55,645
Ah, that was good.

740
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:56,646
Oh-ho.

741
00:37:56,648 --> 00:37:59,615
Oh. You gotta learn to laugh.

742
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:02,751
It's the way to true love.

743
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:07,222
¶ Come on the risin' wind ¶

744
00:38:07,224 --> 00:38:11,458

745
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:15,060

746
00:38:16,997 --> 00:38:18,662
¶ do do doo-doo... ¶

747
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:32,374
"The world's largest ball of twine

748
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,142
has a circumference of 45 feet."

749
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:35,743
What's the excuse?

750
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:37,811
Well, it's just going to take
a little longer than we thought

751
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:39,279
because we have to stay
off the main highway.

752
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,313
Fly.

753
00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:41,914
He won't fly.

754
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:42,848
Why?

755
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,316
Because he can't fit
in coach seats.

756
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:46,117
His wings take too much space.

757
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,651
Wanna pay first class?

758
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:48,618
Drive.

759
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,553
"Eventually, it was
transported here.

760

762

Battle.

763
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:08,467
We'll be there.
Don't worry.

764
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:09,469
What can happen, you know?

765
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,069
Trust me.
Nothing.

766
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,303
Michael?

767
00:39:12,305 --> 00:39:15,272
Don't fret, Malt.

768
00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:16,339
Quinlan!

769
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:17,606
Michael!

770
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:20,141
Michael!

771
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:23,844
What are you doing!?

772
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,684
Battle!

773
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,829
Michael.

774
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:47,497
Michael.

775
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:49,632
Michael, you know what that is?

776
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:52,935
Battle!

777
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,509
Michael. Don't.

778
00:40:20,228 --> 00:40:21,794
Michael.

779
00:40:28,435 --> 00:40:29,934
Michael.

780
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,268
Ha!

781
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,004
I am completely happy.

782
00:40:34,006 --> 00:40:35,271
Are you all right?

783
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:36,872
Can you feel your legs?

784
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:37,873
Whooo.

785
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,307
Ha ha ha.

786
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:44,277
No injuries.
6,360 battles.

787
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:45,544
Can you sit up?

788
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:47,812
Of course I can sit up.

789
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,349
Ah. Now that...

790
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,118
That is my nature.

791
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,119
Yes.

792
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,087
I am a grass roller,

793
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,089
but I'm doomed to live in one place

794
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,723
and crave the pleasures of another.

795
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,624
But don't you feel sorry for me, no.

796
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:05,359
Why would we feel sorry for you?

797
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:06,660
Because this is my last blast.

798
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:08,261
26. That's all we get.

799
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:09,862
Thank you, Quinlan.

800
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:10,963
For what?

801
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:13,532
I think he's saying
there's no sex in heaven.

802
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:15,033
Is that what he's saying?

803
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:17,502
You know, it's really not polite

804
00:41:17,504 --> 00:41:19,170
to talk about someone
in the third person

805
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:20,104
when that person is here.

806
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:22,139
I know. I'm very sorry.
Sparky!

807
00:41:22,141 --> 00:41:25,275
What do you mean...

808
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,676
"Last blast"?

809
00:41:26,678 --> 00:41:29,345
Only so many visits allowed.

810
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:35,883
I'm going to miss
everything so much.

811
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:37,551
Ooh...

812
00:41:40,155 --> 00:41:41,220
Mmm!

813
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:50,095
Why are you here?

814
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:53,598
Why are you saying
it has anything to do with me?

815
00:41:57,903 --> 00:41:59,869
The sun was having an argument
with the north wind:

816
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:02,004
Who was smarter,
who was stronger.

817
00:42:02,006 --> 00:42:04,272
The north wind pointed out a man
walking down the street.

818
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:07,608
"I bet I can make that man
take off his coat, and you can't."

819
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,643
"I'll take that bet," said the sun.

820
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:11,311
The north wind blew
and blew and blew,

821
00:42:11,313 --> 00:42:12,745
and the more that wind blew,

822
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:14,580
the tighter that man
held that coat around himself.

823
00:42:14,582 --> 00:42:18,216
And then the sun
came out and smiled,

824
00:42:18,218 --> 00:42:19,984
and it became warmer.

825
00:42:19,986 --> 00:42:21,819
The man took off his coat.

826
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:30,459
What is that supposed to mean?

827
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:32,160
Did you make a bet about me?

828
00:42:32,162 --> 00:42:34,729
Well, I had to get
back here somehow.

829
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:37,397
Hey, watch the wings there, buddy.

830
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:51,509
¶ sittin', thinkin' ¶

831

834
00:42:58,382 --> 00:43:00,348
That's not how you eat a lemon.

835
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,883
How do you eat a lemon?

836
00:43:03,652 --> 00:43:05,985
You cut it in half...

837
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:08,754
Put salt on it.

838
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:09,821
That is how <i>you</i> eat a lemon.

839
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:10,955
That's how you eat a lemon.

840
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:12,690
Oh, is this a rule?

841
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,792
Hey.

842
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,727
Hey to you, too.

843
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:24,164
Thank you.

844
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:26,032
Do you have pie?

845
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:31,136
Do you have pie?

846
00:43:31,138 --> 00:43:32,937
No.

847
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:43,413
I'm a writer, too.

848
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:44,414
Oh, really?

849
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:45,548
What did you write?

850
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,149
<i>Psalm 85.</i>

851
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,385
It wasn't called<i> psalm 85</i> when I wrote it.

852
00:43:51,387 --> 00:43:52,786
I had no idea

853
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:55,789
they were going to be
collected and numbered.

854
00:44:01,128 --> 00:44:02,760
Yeah. Yeah.

855
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:04,128
It was right around the time

856
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,130
I invented standing in line.

857
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:07,798
You invented standing in line?

858
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,467
Before that, everybody
just milled around.

859
00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:11,668
It was a mess.

860
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,670
So one day I said,
"why not make a line?"

861
00:44:13,672 --> 00:44:14,704
A line for what?

862
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:16,105
To get in.

863
00:44:16,107 --> 00:44:18,674
Why don't you ask him
what you want to know?

864
00:44:18,676 --> 00:44:20,142
What do I want to know?

865
00:44:20,144 --> 00:44:22,844
He wants to know why angels
don't solve big problems.

866
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:24,679
That is what I want to know.

867
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:27,815
Why don't angels
solve big problems?

868
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:31,551
You can't change
the nature of the world.

869
00:44:31,553 --> 00:44:32,952
What can you do?

870
00:44:32,954 --> 00:44:35,554
Small miracles.
Only so many.

871
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:37,556
Some angels aren't so smart.

872
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:41,592
They use them up in stupid ways.

873
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:43,727
Like the "parking space" angel?

874
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:46,029
I don't like to criticize other angels.

875
00:44:49,701 --> 00:44:51,634
I'll, uh, be with you in a minute.

876
00:44:51,636 --> 00:44:53,836
Yup.

877
00:44:55,105 --> 00:44:58,572
This is how you eat a lemon.

878
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:00,340
Hey.

879
00:45:02,477 --> 00:45:03,609
Excuse me.

880
00:45:03,611 --> 00:45:04,910
They want me.

881
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:08,113
Now, remember what
John and Paul said.

882
00:45:08,115 --> 00:45:08,913
The apostles?

883
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,581
No. The Beatles.

884
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,849
All you need is love.

885
00:45:12,851 --> 00:45:14,984
Hello, ladies.

886
00:45:22,025 --> 00:45:24,291
Do you believe in angels?

887
00:45:24,293 --> 00:45:25,292
Absolutely.

888
00:45:25,294 --> 00:45:26,993
Have you ever,
ever heard of an angel

889
00:45:26,995 --> 00:45:28,594
that was interested in sex?

890
00:45:28,596 --> 00:45:29,995
Of course not.

891
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:31,763
Angels do not have sex.

892
00:45:31,765 --> 00:45:33,431
But is there one?

893
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:36,066
And I suppose he invented
standing in line.

894
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:37,033
Sparky,

895
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,602
I'm going to take you for a walk.

896
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,003

Awoo!

I invented the hole in the
coffee cup, you know.

947
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:59,273
When you get coffee to go,

948
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:02,809
I was the first person

949
00:48:02,811 --> 00:48:04,343
to rip that little hole in the lid

950
00:48:04,345 --> 00:48:06,111
so you could drink it in the car.

951
00:48:06,113 --> 00:48:07,946
Could've made a fortune.

952
00:48:07,948 --> 00:48:09,280
It's weird.

953
00:48:09,282 --> 00:48:10,114
What?

954
00:48:10,116 --> 00:48:12,316
She's an angel expert, but....

955
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:13,116
What?

956
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,218
Battle!

957
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:21,621
Come on!

958
00:48:26,193 --> 00:48:27,792
For God's sake.
Michael.

959
00:48:27,794 --> 00:48:29,260
Stop.

960
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,266
Hey. You.

961
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:47,809
Battle.

962
00:48:47,811 --> 00:48:49,410
You'd better believe it.

963
00:48:49,412 --> 00:48:50,611
Over here!

964
00:49:18,006 --> 00:49:19,005
It's caramels.

965
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:20,606
He smells like caramels.

966
00:49:20,608 --> 00:49:22,007
It's cotton candy.

967
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:23,008
It's cookies.

968
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,409
He smells like cookies,

969
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:26,711
and the smell gets stronger
when he's in heat.

970
00:49:53,872 --> 00:49:55,271
Eee-yah!

971
00:50:01,112 --> 00:50:03,512
You're a great fighter.

972
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:05,013
I certainly am.

973
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:06,614
I'm cold.

974
00:50:06,616 --> 00:50:07,715
My head hurts.

975
00:50:07,717 --> 00:50:10,017
You folks from the<i> National Mirror?</i>

976
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:12,285
I got a 2-headed
chicken in my yard,

977
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:13,452
if you're interested.

978
00:50:13,454 --> 00:50:14,920
What are we being held for?

979
00:50:14,922 --> 00:50:16,788
Destruction of property,

980
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,790
assault, battery,

981
00:50:18,792 --> 00:50:20,358
and disturbing the peace.

982
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,193
Magistrate will be here in the morning.

983
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:23,627
Your honor, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

984
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:24,628
Good night.

985
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,029
Hey. Hey, hey.

986
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:28,397
We have a phone call coming to us.

987
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:30,765
Hey.

988
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:35,201
Wah-yaaah.

989
00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:37,336
Woo woo-woo.

990
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,476
Ralph got thrown in jail,

991
00:50:45,478 --> 00:50:48,212
but at least he had the decency
to keep me out of it.

992
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:50,847
I don't want to spend the night here.

993
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:52,248
I hate you.

994
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,817
You hate me?
Not you.

995
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:56,819
You hate me?
Not you.

996
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:58,220
The process of elimination.

997
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,955
Who is Ralph?

998
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:03,224
Another husband...

999
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,959
Has popped up.

1000
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,761
Maybe Sparky can get us out.

1001
00:51:07,763 --> 00:51:08,762
Hey.

1002
00:51:08,764 --> 00:51:09,629
Sparky?

1003
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:13,298
Go in the drawer
and get the key.

1004
00:51:14,067 --> 00:51:15,733
Sparky.

1005
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,169
Go in the drawer

1006
00:51:19,171 --> 00:51:21,771
and get the key.

1007
00:51:23,975 --> 00:51:25,441
Dorothy can make him do it.

1008
00:51:25,443 --> 00:51:27,042
Dorothy's good with dogs.

1009
00:51:27,044 --> 00:51:29,677
I have noticed this.

1010
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:32,246
Dogs don't talk.

1011
00:51:32,248 --> 00:51:34,248
They don't shave.

1012
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,385
They don't run off in your Camaro.

1013
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,520
When you want them to take a bath,

1014
00:51:40,522 --> 00:51:42,922
you just make an appointment.

1015
00:51:42,924 --> 00:51:43,923
Sit.

1016
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:44,924
Stay.

1017
00:51:44,926 --> 00:51:46,425
Roll over.

1018
00:51:46,427 --> 00:51:48,359
No.

1019
00:51:49,995 --> 00:51:51,527
Now.

1020
00:51:53,731 --> 00:51:54,996
What?

1021
00:51:54,998 --> 00:51:56,597
Apologize.

1022
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:58,165
Say you're sorry.

1023
00:51:58,167 --> 00:51:59,599
To her?

1024
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:01,467
Be serious.

1025
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:03,869
Or...

1026
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:06,137
I'm not going to...

1027
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:07,738
¶ Chicago ¶

1028
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,005

¶ you'll love it ¶

1035
00:52:22,616 --> 00:52:23,748
Sorry.

1036
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:45,969
I'm sorry.

1037
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,306
I'm sorry.

1038
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:57,044
I didn't mean it...

1039
00:52:57,046 --> 00:52:58,477
Ok?

1040
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:02,413
Dorothy.

1041
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,722
You cold?

1042
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:19,058
Here.

1043
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,726
Take my blanket, ok?

1044
00:53:39,746 --> 00:53:41,345
I'm going to sleep.

1045
00:53:43,082 --> 00:53:44,748
Me, too.

1046
00:54:39,202 --> 00:54:41,001
All rise, all rise.

1047
00:54:41,003 --> 00:54:43,870
The court of bickle county
is now in session.

1048
00:54:43,872 --> 00:54:46,072
The honorable judge
Esther Newberg presiding.

1049
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,339
Please rise.

1050
00:54:51,677 --> 00:54:52,776
Ahem.

1051
00:54:52,778 --> 00:54:53,943
Be seated.

1052
00:54:57,214 --> 00:54:58,947
Now...

1053
00:54:58,949 --> 00:55:01,082
You are charged with...

1054
00:55:01,084 --> 00:55:02,216
Disturbing the peace,

1055
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:03,850
destruction of property...

1056
00:55:03,852 --> 00:55:05,184
$1,200 worth.

1057
00:55:05,186 --> 00:55:06,485
I know.
I spoke to Jenny.

1058
00:55:06,487 --> 00:55:08,954
Who's, uh, Jenny?

1059
00:55:08,956 --> 00:55:10,221
That's his wife.

1060
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,455
She told me

1061
00:55:11,457 --> 00:55:13,356
that sweet little painting
above the bar...

1062
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:15,358
uh, 2 moose hunters in a canoe...

1063
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,826
smashed to smithereens.

1064
00:55:16,828 --> 00:55:18,093
That is so sad.

1065
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:19,194
Yep.

1066
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:21,362
Isn't this a conflict of interest?

1067
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:22,896
Did I say you could speak?

1068
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:27,099
I know someone who can restore paintings.

1069
00:55:27,101 --> 00:55:28,500
I told Jenny, "stop crying.

1070
00:55:28,502 --> 00:55:30,235
I will take care of it."

1071
00:55:30,237 --> 00:55:31,469
Now...

1072
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:34,738
Who can tell me
exactly what happened l...

1073
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,839
Last night?

1074
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:36,840
I can.

1075
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:38,107
Anyone else?

1076
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:39,942
We were having dinner...

1077
00:55:39,944 --> 00:55:41,710
Not you.

1078
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:42,510
If I may...

1079
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:44,245
put your hand down.

1080
00:55:44,247 --> 00:55:45,713
You.

1081
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:46,847
Please.

1082
00:55:47,783 --> 00:55:50,116
In chambers.

1083
00:55:50,118 --> 00:55:53,119
All rise, all rise.

1084
00:55:53,121 --> 00:55:54,520
The court of bickle county,

1085
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:56,121
judge Esther Newberg presiding,

1086
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:57,722
is now in recess.

1087
00:55:57,724 --> 00:55:58,522
Please rise.

1088
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:15,837

00:57:33,297 --> 00:57:34,696
Hey! Wait a minute.

1138
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:36,898
Wait, wait. Meadsboro 1 mile.

1139
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,299
So?

1140
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:40,701
So that's where the world's 
largest non-stick frying pan is.

1141
00:57:40,703 --> 00:57:42,302
Oh, no, Michael.

1142
00:57:42,304 --> 00:57:43,703
We are not stopping

1143
00:57:43,705 --> 00:57:46,305
to see the world's largest 
non-stick frying pan.

1144
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:47,306
Why not?

1145
00:57:47,308 --> 00:57:48,473
Because we have to get back.

1146
00:57:48,475 --> 00:57:50,074
Well, me, too,

1147
00:57:50,076 --> 00:57:51,508
but before that happens,

1148
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,377
I would like to see the world's 
largest non-stick frying pan.

1149
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:55,544
It<i> is</i> on the way.

1150
00:57:55,546 --> 00:57:56,545
Every time we stop somewhere,

1151
00:57:56,547 --> 00:57:57,812
he gets us in trouble.

1152
00:57:57,814 --> 00:57:59,547
But he also gets us out of trouble.

1153
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:01,148
Huey!
Huey!

1154
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,149
What?

1155
00:58:02,151 --> 00:58:03,483
Well, he<i> does.</i>

1156
00:58:03,485 --> 00:58:06,552
I mean, look, that judge just took
one look at him and...

1157
00:58:06,554 --> 00:58:07,719
what is that?

1158
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:09,554
What is it about you?

1159
00:58:09,556 --> 00:58:10,821
What?

1160
00:58:10,823 --> 00:58:13,356
As a woman, could you
explain that to me?

1161
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:16,559
How should I know?
I'm not the least bit attracted to him.

1162
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:18,561
No offense, Michael, but I'm not.

1163
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:20,296
I put a block on you.

1164
00:58:20,298 --> 00:58:21,297
Oh, sure.

1165
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:22,298
I did.

1166
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,700
All right, to continue...

1167
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,668
"Presumably...

1168
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,970
"This frying pan was coated with teflon

1169
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,572
"to save a wee bit on
the amount of cholesterol

1170
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,974
"ingested by the town
of meadsboro every year

1171

00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:37,710
Michael, we're not stopping.

1173
00:58:37,712 --> 00:58:40,245
You have 10 seconds
to change your mind.

1174
00:58:41,181 --> 00:58:42,580
10-hippopotamus.

1175
00:58:42,582 --> 00:58:44,315
9-hippopotamus.

1176
00:58:44,317 --> 00:58:45,582
8-hippopotamus.

1177
00:58:45,584 --> 00:58:47,584
How much more attractive
is he than I am?

1178
00:58:47,586 --> 00:58:48,585
7-hippopotamus.

1179
00:58:48,587 --> 00:58:49,586
Be honest with me.

1180
00:58:49,588 --> 00:58:51,220
Huey, this is not healthy.

1181
00:58:51,222 --> 00:58:53,255
5-hippopotamus

1182
00:58:53,257 --> 00:58:54,889
4-hippopotamus.

1183
00:58:54,891 --> 00:58:56,023
3, 2, 1!

1184
00:59:26,484 --> 00:59:27,883
There's no jack!

1185
00:59:27,885 --> 00:59:29,584
Of course there is no jack!

1186
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:31,586
Just ask him to fix it.

1187
00:59:31,588 --> 00:59:33,588
He blew it, he can fix it!

1188
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:36,157
Fix this tire!
Come back here this instant

1189
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:37,591
and fix this tire!

1190
00:59:37,593 --> 00:59:39,859
No can do.

1191
00:59:52,773 --> 00:59:55,373
I miss my wife.

1192
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:58,175
I don't miss any of my husbands.

1193
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,744
Although Bradley
<i>was</i> handy with a jack.

1194
01:00:00,746 --> 01:00:02,345
He had to be.

1195
01:00:02,347 --> 01:00:05,114
I don't wanna ask why.

1196
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:07,282
His tires were bald.

1197
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,823
His tires were bald.

1198
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:17,858
So was his head.

1199
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:22,061
I wish he'd call,
but now he's dead.

1200
01:00:24,565 --> 01:00:26,865
He's not dead,
and he wasn't bald.

1201
01:00:27,701 --> 01:00:29,434
Poetic license.

1202
01:00:29,436 --> 01:00:31,969
¶ His tires were bald ¶

1203

¶ that ¶

1207

Maybe you could write
a song about my wife.

1208
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,182
Do you love her?

1209
01:00:48,184 --> 01:00:49,583
Oh-ho.

1210
01:00:49,585 --> 01:00:51,585
Hey, she drives me wild.

1211
01:00:51,587 --> 01:00:52,786
Mmm.

1212
01:00:52,788 --> 01:00:54,721
What about her?

1213
01:00:57,592 --> 01:00:59,592
She had her lips done.

1214
01:00:59,594 --> 01:01:02,194
Had little bits of fat

1215
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:04,229
squeezed into them.

1216
01:01:04,231 --> 01:01:07,398
Now my wife has lips
like a blowfish...

1217
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:10,200
But in a good way.

1218
01:01:10,202 --> 01:01:11,267
Mmm.

1219
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:14,202
¶ My wife ¶

1220
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:15,336

1222
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,607
I... I don't see it,

1223
01:01:20,609 --> 01:01:22,609
but you know, I could be wrong.

1224
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:24,410
If I had any talent
as a country singer,

1225
01:01:24,412 --> 01:01:27,012
I wouldn't be sitting
on the side of the road

1226
01:01:27,014 --> 01:01:28,880
in the middle of nowhere.

1227
01:01:34,186 --> 01:01:36,619
¶ Sittin' on the side

1228

¶ in the middle of nowhere ¶

1229
01:01:40,758 --> 01:01:43,125
Sounds awfully familiar.

1230
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:45,894
Mmm. But it's good, though.

1231
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:53,033
This is one godforsaken road.

1232
01:01:53,035 --> 01:01:56,302
I'll bet you no one ever comes down it.

1233
01:02:08,048 --> 01:02:10,915
Yeah, well, they won't stop, though.

1234
01:02:18,257 --> 01:02:19,389
Hi there.

1235
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,225
Bet you need a jack.

1236
01:02:24,529 --> 01:02:26,529
I spun around,

1237
01:02:26,531 --> 01:02:28,063
and the next thing that happened

1238
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:30,065
was he came as 100 mouths,

1239
01:02:30,067 --> 01:02:31,466
open and stinking with decay,

1240
01:02:31,468 --> 01:02:34,469
and he tore at my flesh
from every angle of heaven.

1241
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:37,238
So I grabbed beelzebub's
blue tongue in my fist.

1242
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:37,938
Whoa, man.

1243
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,940
Who's beelzebub?

1244
01:02:39,942 --> 01:02:42,208
Beelzebub is Satan.

1245
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:43,576
Oh.

1246
01:02:43,578 --> 01:02:44,843
Satan.

1247
01:02:45,579 --> 01:02:48,179
Michael, get in the car.

1248
01:03:01,392 --> 01:03:03,725

01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:09,597

1253
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,599
What'll it be, folks?

1254
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:14,601
Do you have pie?

1255
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:16,402
Do we have pie?

1256
01:03:16,404 --> 01:03:19,271
Buddy, you're in the 
pie capital of America.

1257
01:03:19,273 --> 01:03:21,206
Well, we want...

1258
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,473
We want pie.

1259
01:03:22,475 --> 01:03:23,740
What have you got?

1260
01:03:23,742 --> 01:03:25,274
I got them memorized.

1261
01:03:25,276 --> 01:03:26,074
Ok, ready?

1262
01:03:26,076 --> 01:03:28,076
We got apple, of course,

1263
01:03:28,078 --> 01:03:30,011
banana cream, coconut cream,

1264
01:03:30,013 --> 01:03:31,612
sour cream raisin...

1265
01:03:31,614 --> 01:03:33,614
Chocolate cream?

1266
01:03:33,616 --> 01:03:36,216
Definitely chocolate cream.

1267
01:03:36,218 --> 01:03:37,850
And...

1268
01:03:37,852 --> 01:03:39,451
strawberry-rhubarb pie

1269
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:41,753
and cherry

1270
01:03:41,755 --> 01:03:43,887
and lemon meringue...

1271
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:48,624
We want 2 slices of everything.

1272
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:51,226
And vanilla ice cream on the side.

1273
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:52,627
You got it.

1274
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:53,761
Thank you.

1275
01:04:01,336 --> 01:04:02,735
¶ Crazy ¶

1276
01:04:02,737 --> 01:04:03,869

1280
01:04:09,743 --> 01:04:11,342
Mmm. Chocolate.

1281
01:04:11,344 --> 01:04:12,343
Mmm. Ooh.

1282
01:04:12,345 --> 01:04:13,744
Ahh. Bliss.

1283
01:04:13,746 --> 01:04:15,178
Bliss.

1284
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,546
That's banana cream
and that's coconut.

1285
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:19,015
Everybody get out of
my banana cream pie.

1286
01:04:19,017 --> 01:04:20,016
Mmm.

1287
01:04:20,018 --> 01:04:21,417
That's... that's the pie.

1288
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:23,285
What's is this?
What is this pie?

1289
01:04:23,287 --> 01:04:25,186
This is sour cream-raisin.
Very underrated pie.

1290
01:04:25,188 --> 01:04:26,787
Lemon meringue pie.

1291
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:29,022
This is the key lime.

1292
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:30,523
Mm-mmm. Lemon meringue.

1293
01:04:30,525 --> 01:04:32,091
What is it about pie?

1294
01:04:32,093 --> 01:04:33,492
It's pretty, you know?

1295
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,160
There's nothing prettier than pie,

1296
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,162
with the little scalloped edges around the sides

1297
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,164
and little slits in the top
for the heat to escape.

1298
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,765
Pie gives you the sense

1299
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:42,366
that you're a four-square person

1300
01:04:42,368 --> 01:04:44,434
living in a four-square country.

1301
01:04:44,436 --> 01:04:45,768
Well, pie says home.

1302
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,069
As american as apple pie.

1303
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:48,537
I wish I invented pie.

1304
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:50,438
I did.

1305
01:04:53,776 --> 01:04:55,442
I'm just kidding.

1306
01:04:56,778 --> 01:04:58,410
That was a good one.

1307
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,881
God's in his heaven,
and all's right with the world.

1308
01:05:02,883 --> 01:05:05,783
Mmm. My mother made a great...

1309
01:05:05,785 --> 01:05:08,051
Blueberry pie.

1310
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:10,786
Yes.

1311
01:05:10,788 --> 01:05:12,687
So do I.

1312
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:14,822
I have to say I like cream pie

1313
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:16,590
more than fruit pie.

1314
01:05:16,592 --> 01:05:17,791
Me, too.

1315
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:19,793
That is so wrong.

1316
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:21,661
I like them all.

1317
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,262
I like you.

1318
01:05:23,264 --> 01:05:24,329
Mmm.

1319
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:27,198
Dorothy...

1320
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,600
Sing your song about pie.

1321
01:05:30,803 --> 01:05:33,469
You have a song about pie?

1322
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:36,071
Actually, I do.

1323
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:38,406
Sing, Dorothy.

1324
01:05:38,408 --> 01:05:40,240
Now.

1325

Ohh.

1339
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:14,833
It's, um, it's in B-flat.

1340
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:16,167
It's pretty basic,

1341
01:06:16,169 --> 01:06:19,369
but watch out for the guitar
down there, ok?

1342
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,439
Ahem.

1343
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:24,573
Oh.

1344
01:06:25,576 --> 01:06:26,741
Ahem. Hi.

1345
01:06:26,743 --> 01:06:27,742
I'm nervous.

1346
01:06:27,744 --> 01:06:29,376
Oh, this is, uh...

1347
01:06:29,378 --> 01:06:31,378
you'll have to forgive me.

1348
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,246
It's a work in progress.

1349
01:06:33,248 --> 01:06:34,847
Don't apologize, Dorothy.

1350
01:06:34,849 --> 01:06:35,848
Ok.

1351
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:36,849
Ok.

1352
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:39,351
1, 2, 3

1353
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:44,889
¶ I'm sittin' by the side of the road ¶

1354
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:48,225
¶ in the middle of nowhere ¶

1355
01:06:49,528 --> 01:06:52,262
¶ I don't know where I'm going ¶

1356
01:06:52,264 --> 01:06:54,864
¶ but I hope I know it ¶

1357
01:06:54,866 --> 01:06:57,233
¶ when I get there ¶

1358
01:06:57,235 --> 01:06:58,867
¶ thinkin' about ¶

1359
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:01,269
¶ how love never works out ¶

1360
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:04,272
¶ I guess that's the way it goes ¶

1361
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:07,408
¶ and how this story ends ¶

1362
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,711
¶ only heaven knows ¶

1363
01:07:12,047 --> 01:07:14,013
¶ I always thought ¶

1364
01:07:14,015 --> 01:07:16,281
¶ there was an angel ¶

1365
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:19,651
¶ watchin' over me ¶

1366
01:07:19,653 --> 01:07:21,886
¶ but even angels ¶

1367
01:07:21,888 --> 01:07:24,421
¶ sometimes make mistakes ¶

1368
01:07:24,423 --> 01:07:26,856
¶ as you will see ¶

1369
01:07:26,858 --> 01:07:28,891
¶ 'cause I've had my share ¶

1370
01:07:28,893 --> 01:07:30,893
¶ of bad love affairs ¶

1371
01:07:30,895 --> 01:07:31,894
¶ in fact ¶

1372
01:07:31,896 --> 01:07:33,896
¶ I married 3 ¶

1373
01:07:34,665 --> 01:07:37,298
¶ so here's my little story ¶

1374
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,733
¶ about Myles ¶

1375
01:07:39,735 --> 01:07:42,335
¶ Ralph and Bradley ¶

1376
01:07:42,337 --> 01:07:45,438
¶ Myles made me smile ¶

1377
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,307
¶ till he stole my Camaro ¶

1378
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:52,642
¶ Ralph made me laugh ¶

1379
01:07:52,644 --> 01:07:55,710
¶ till I cried ¶

1380
01:07:56,913 --> 01:07:58,913
¶ and Bradley ¶

1381
01:07:58,915 --> 01:08:02,649
¶ oh, I loved him madly ¶

1382
01:08:03,918 --> 01:08:06,318
¶ but his tires were bald ¶

1383
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,986
¶ and they went flat ¶

1384
01:08:07,988 --> 01:08:09,921
¶ so did our love ¶

1385
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:12,690
¶ and that was that ¶

1386
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:15,926
¶ now I'm sittin' in the middle of nowhere ¶

1387
01:08:15,928 --> 01:08:18,828
¶ by the side of the road ¶

1388
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:22,330
¶ one of these days ¶

1389
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,165
¶ I'll find true love ¶

1390
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:26,867
¶ and learn how to say no ¶

1391
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:29,936
¶ I know in the past ¶

1392
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:31,737
¶ my love didn't last ¶

1393
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:34,673
¶ as I guess this story shows ¶

1394
01:08:34,675 --> 01:08:38,076
¶ where was
my angel then? ¶

1395
01:08:38,078 --> 01:08:40,745
¶ only heaven knows ¶

1396
01:08:42,348 --> 01:08:45,581
¶ where was
my angel then? ¶

1397
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:49,551
¶ only heaven ¶

1398
01:08:49,553 --> 01:08:52,587
¶ knows ¶

1399
01:08:57,159 --> 01:08:58,625
Yeah!

1400
01:08:58,627 --> 01:09:00,059
Whoo!

1401
01:09:00,061 --> 01:09:01,160
Whoo!

1402
01:09:17,377 --> 01:09:19,977
And then when I went 
to college I was published.

1403
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:21,378
You were published?

1404
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:22,979
Yeah, I was published.

1405
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:24,013
Well, kind of.

1406
01:09:24,015 --> 01:09:25,581
It's was like a yearly thing.

1407
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:26,582
Poems, you know?

1408
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:27,583
That's great.

1409
01:09:27,585 --> 01:09:28,584
That's great.

1410
01:09:28,586 --> 01:09:29,384
Uh-huh.

1411
01:09:29,386 --> 01:09:30,985
That's really great.

1412
01:09:30,987 --> 01:09:31,986
Ahh, it's cold.

1413
01:09:31,988 --> 01:09:32,987
Yeah.

1414
01:09:32,989 --> 01:09:34,388
I'm in there.

1415
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:36,256
This is Huey's room.

1416
01:09:36,992 --> 01:09:38,224
Where are you?

1417
01:09:38,226 --> 01:09:40,593
I'm in 4.

1418
01:09:40,595 --> 01:09:41,994
Where is that?

1419
01:09:41,996 --> 01:09:43,762
It's up there.

1420
01:09:44,998 --> 01:09:45,997
Where exactly?

1421
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:47,398
On the corner.

1422
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,999
On the corner right there?

1423
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:50,100
Directly over my room?

1424
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,634
Uh...

1425
01:09:51,636 --> 01:09:52,968
Mm-hmm.

1426
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:56,037
Um...

1427
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:58,039
You were great.

1428
01:09:58,041 --> 01:09:59,640
Really great.

1429
01:09:59,642 --> 01:10:01,041
Um...

1430
01:10:01,043 --> 01:10:02,042
Ahem.

1431
01:10:02,044 --> 01:10:03,043
It was...

1432
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:04,644
Good night.

1433
01:10:04,646 --> 01:10:06,312
Yeah. Good night.

1434
01:10:07,048 --> 01:10:08,313
Ahem.

1435
01:10:09,649 --> 01:10:11,315
It was...

1436
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:13,450
Mm-hmm.

1437
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:18,187
¶ Something in your eyes ¶

1438
01:10:18,189 --> 01:10:21,723
¶ makes me want to lose myself ¶

1439
01:10:23,059 --> 01:10:26,593
¶ makes me want to lose myself ¶

1440
01:10:28,229 --> 01:10:30,996
¶ in your arms ¶

1441
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:35,867
¶ something in your... ¶

1442
01:10:35,869 --> 01:10:38,669
What are... what are...
what are you doing tonight?

1443
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:40,070
Not much.

1444
01:10:40,072 --> 01:10:42,072
Do you wanna come to my room?

1445
01:10:42,074 --> 01:10:44,674
Why don't you come to mine?

1446
01:10:44,676 --> 01:10:46,075
That's...

1447
01:10:46,077 --> 01:10:47,476
That's a good idea.

1448
01:10:47,478 --> 01:10:49,878
¶ The rest of my life ¶

1449
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:54,481
¶ if you knew ¶

1450
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:57,184
¶ how lonely ¶

1451
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,319
¶ my life ¶

1452
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:01,054
¶ has been ¶

1453
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,189
¶ and how low ¶

1454
01:11:03,191 --> 01:11:04,590
Whew.

1455
01:11:04,592 --> 01:11:06,792
¶ I've felt ¶

1456
01:11:06,794 --> 01:11:09,727
¶ so long ¶

1457
01:11:11,197 --> 01:11:13,597
¶ if you knew ¶

1458
01:11:13,599 --> 01:11:16,933
¶ how I wanted someone ¶

1459
01:11:16,935 --> 01:11:21,203
¶ to come along ¶

1460
01:11:21,205 --> 01:11:23,605
¶ and change... ¶

1461
01:11:23,607 --> 01:11:25,807
I have to tell you something.

1462
01:11:25,809 --> 01:11:26,808
I know.

1463
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:27,775
I'm not...

1464
01:11:27,777 --> 01:11:29,810
Ever falling in love
with anyone again.

1465
01:11:29,812 --> 01:11:30,610
I know.

1466
01:11:30,612 --> 01:11:33,212
¶ Feels like home ¶

1467
01:11:33,214 --> 01:11:34,613
¶ to me ¶

1468
01:11:34,615 --> 01:11:38,215
¶ feels like home ¶

1469
01:11:38,217 --> 01:11:39,616
¶ to me ¶

¶ feels like ¶

1471

¶ I'm all the way back ¶

1472
01:11:43,622 --> 01:11:47,490
¶ where I come from ¶

1473
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,327
¶ feels like home ¶

1474
01:11:52,329 --> 01:11:53,961
¶ to me ¶

1475
01:11:53,963 --> 01:11:56,830
¶ feels like home ¶

1476
01:11:56,832 --> 01:11:58,364
¶ to me ¶

1477

¶ feels like I'm ¶

1478
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:03,234
¶ all the way back ¶

1479
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:07,037
¶ where I belong ¶

1480
01:12:20,384 --> 01:12:21,983
Ok, ok.

1481
01:12:21,985 --> 01:12:23,250
Ohh.

1482
01:12:23,252 --> 01:12:25,085
Ok, ok.

1483
01:13:16,903 --> 01:13:18,302
Come on, Sparky.

1484
01:13:18,304 --> 01:13:19,303
Come on.

1485
01:13:19,305 --> 01:13:21,305
Come on, boy.

1486
01:13:21,307 --> 01:13:22,906
Yes.

1487
01:13:22,908 --> 01:13:24,908
Wings?

1488
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:26,910
Far out!

1489
01:13:26,912 --> 01:13:28,311
Ha ha!

1490
01:13:28,313 --> 01:13:29,845
Some angel.

1491
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:41,522
¶ I see trees ¶

1492
01:13:41,524 --> 01:13:43,657
¶ of green ¶

1493
01:13:43,659 --> 01:13:46,126
¶ red roses, too ¶

1494
01:13:47,129 --> 01:13:49,729
¶ I see them bloom ¶

1495
01:13:49,731 --> 01:13:53,332
¶ for me and you ¶

1496
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:56,734
¶ and I think to myself ¶

1497
01:13:58,204 --> 01:14:02,005
¶ what a wonderful world ¶

1498
01:14:04,743 --> 01:14:06,342
¶ what a wonderful world ¶

1499
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:08,277
¶ I see skies ¶

¶ of white ¶

1503
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:16,483
¶ the bright blessed days ¶

1504
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:19,752
¶ from the dark sacred nights ¶

1505
01:14:19,754 --> 01:14:24,322
¶ and I think to myself ¶

1506
01:14:24,324 --> 01:14:28,893
¶ what a wonderful world ¶

1507
01:14:32,398 --> 01:14:37,934
¶ and I think to myself ¶

1508
01:14:38,736 --> 01:14:41,103
¶ What a wonderful ¶

1509
01:14:41,105 --> 01:14:43,038
¶ world ¶

1510
01:14:47,978 --> 01:14:50,044
I needed the job.

1511
01:14:56,385 --> 01:14:58,084
Good morning.

1512
01:14:58,086 --> 01:15:02,054
What exactly are we
talking about here?

1513
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:04,189
At the paper.

1514
01:15:04,191 --> 01:15:06,791
That's what I was trying
to tell you last night.

1515
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,392
That's why I'm here.

1516
01:15:08,394 --> 01:15:10,394
I don't make excuses
for working there.

1517
01:15:10,396 --> 01:15:13,063
There's no reason for you to.

1518
01:15:17,268 --> 01:15:19,401
Here's a confession.

1519
01:15:19,403 --> 01:15:21,403
You wanna hear a confession?

1520
01:15:21,405 --> 01:15:22,804
Yours?

1521
01:15:22,806 --> 01:15:25,873
I needed the job, too.

1522
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:26,807
Huh.

1523
01:15:26,809 --> 01:15:28,809
No one would go near me

1524
01:15:28,811 --> 01:15:30,544
after what happened at the<i> tribune.</i>

1525
01:15:30,546 --> 01:15:32,913
What did happen?

1526
01:15:32,915 --> 01:15:34,080
Oh.

1527
01:15:35,249 --> 01:15:38,216
I hit the managing editor.

1528
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:39,750
Why?

1529
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:42,753
He fired this really sweet old guy

1530
01:15:42,755 --> 01:15:45,355
who'd been there
for, like, 27 years.

1531
01:15:46,091 --> 01:15:47,557
Really?

1532
01:15:47,559 --> 01:15:49,225
Nope.

1533
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:53,361
He changed my lead.

1534
01:15:53,363 --> 01:15:55,563
You hit him...

1535
01:15:55,565 --> 01:15:58,566
Because he changed your lead?

1536
01:15:58,568 --> 01:16:00,234
No.

1537
01:16:01,737 --> 01:16:05,104
It was late.
I was drunk.

1538
01:16:07,575 --> 01:16:08,707
The way I see it,

1539
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:10,575
it makes no difference where I work.

1540
01:16:10,577 --> 01:16:12,577
That's what I call a lie.

1541
01:16:12,579 --> 01:16:14,712
I bet you have a half-finished novel

1542
01:16:14,714 --> 01:16:17,281
in the second drawer of your desk.

1543
01:16:17,283 --> 01:16:19,116
She got the desk.

1544
01:16:20,119 --> 01:16:22,919
Are you keeping something from me?

1545
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,957
I'm not ethical.

1546
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:31,559
Just because you write about angels

1547
01:16:31,561 --> 01:16:33,827
for a supermarket tabloid?

1548
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:43,201
Are you keeping some 
angel experience from me?

1549
01:16:44,537 --> 01:16:47,203
If you are, I forgive you.

1550
01:16:48,539 --> 01:16:50,805
I could forgive you anything.

1551
01:16:54,677 --> 01:16:56,343
This was not a mistake.

1552
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,812
Don't say that you think
this was a mistake.

1553
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:00,213
I couldn't bear it.

1554
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,426
¶ We're here ¶

1555
01:17:14,428 --> 01:17:16,828
¶ because we're here ¶

1556
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:19,564
¶ because we're here ¶

1557
01:17:19,566 --> 01:17:22,833
¶ because we're here ¶

1558
01:17:25,571 --> 01:17:27,703
It's going well.

1559
01:17:29,973 --> 01:17:32,573
It's a difficult case, though,

1560
01:17:32,575 --> 01:17:35,709
to give a man back his heart.

1561
01:17:40,315 --> 01:17:42,315
Mmm.

1562
01:17:42,317 --> 01:17:44,016
Listen.

1563
01:17:45,352 --> 01:17:49,387
Ooh... Listen to the earth.

1564
01:17:57,196 --> 01:17:58,595
Mmm.

1565
01:17:58,597 --> 01:18:01,731
I'm going to miss
everything so much.

1566
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:13,474
You got to remember, Sparky,

1567
01:18:13,476 --> 01:18:15,476
no matter what they tell you,

1568
01:18:15,478 --> 01:18:18,145
you can never
have too much sugar.

1569
01:18:32,227 --> 01:18:33,626
Dorothy.

1570
01:18:33,628 --> 01:18:35,160
Quinlan.

1571
01:18:36,897 --> 01:18:39,230
Good morning, Michael.

1572
01:18:39,232 --> 01:18:41,265
Good morning, Sparky.

1573
01:18:48,706 --> 01:18:49,971
Sparky, no!

1574
01:18:52,108 --> 01:18:53,841
No!

1575
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:56,843
Ohh!

1576
01:19:04,051 --> 01:19:07,252
Oh, he's all right.
He's all right.

1577
01:19:07,254 --> 01:19:08,786
Ohh!

1578
01:19:11,257 --> 01:19:13,323
He's all right.

1579
01:19:13,325 --> 01:19:15,058
No.

1580
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,260
Ohh.

1581
01:19:17,262 --> 01:19:19,662
Oh, I killed him.

1582
01:19:19,664 --> 01:19:21,263
It's not your fault.

1583
01:19:21,265 --> 01:19:22,664
It's all my fault.

1584
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:24,332
I'm so sorry, Huey.

1585
01:19:30,072 --> 01:19:32,172
I'm so sorry.

1586
01:19:42,617 --> 01:19:45,517
You didn't do anything wrong.

1587
01:19:58,298 --> 01:20:00,364
Do something.

1588
01:20:00,366 --> 01:20:02,299
It isn't my area.

1589
01:20:02,301 --> 01:20:05,835
What is your area?
Explain it to me.

1590
01:20:05,837 --> 01:20:11,106
Would somebody tell me
exactly what is his area?

1591
01:20:11,108 --> 01:20:13,241
I don't know anything
about his area.

1592
01:20:13,243 --> 01:20:16,110
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1593
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:17,311
What?

1594
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:20,314
I don't know anything about angels.

1595
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:24,551
I'm a dog trainer.
That's why I was hired.

1596
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:28,487
To train Sparky?

1597
01:20:28,489 --> 01:20:29,488
And then...

1598
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:30,755
then after...

1599
01:20:30,757 --> 01:20:35,392
We screw up with the angel,
and Malt gets the dog...

1600
01:20:36,828 --> 01:20:39,361
I get Huey's job.

1601
01:20:41,531 --> 01:20:43,430
I didn't know you.

1602
01:20:46,768 --> 01:20:49,568
I'm sorry.

1603
01:20:50,704 --> 01:20:52,670
I'm sorry, too.

1604
01:20:56,242 --> 01:21:00,143
Now bring him back to life.

1605
01:21:00,145 --> 01:21:02,879
And don't give me any of that 
"it isn't my area" stuff.

1606
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:05,381
Bring him back to life

1607
01:21:05,383 --> 01:21:09,118
or go back where you came from.

1608
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,386
Bring him back...

1609
01:21:14,457 --> 01:21:16,256
Angel.

1610
01:23:46,403 --> 01:23:49,570
I don't have much longer.

1611
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:24,704
Ohh.

1612
01:24:25,773 --> 01:24:27,572
Ohh.

1613
01:24:39,618 --> 01:24:41,150
Ohh.

1614
01:24:45,055 --> 01:24:46,220
Ohh.

1615
01:25:04,472 --> 01:25:06,872
We're here, Michael.
We're here.

1616
01:25:17,084 --> 01:25:19,884
Michael, look up.

1617
01:25:22,622 --> 01:25:26,623
"The sears tower in Chicago 
is the world's tallest building.

1618
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:29,959
"It stands 1,454 feet above street level,

1619
01:25:29,961 --> 01:25:35,197
contains enough concrete
for an 8-Lane highway."

1620
01:25:37,401 --> 01:25:38,800
Ohh.

1621
01:25:38,802 --> 01:25:41,269
Ohh.

1622
01:25:42,405 --> 01:25:43,737
Ahh.

1623
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:47,106
Quinlan, I'm so sorry.

1624
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,908
I didn't do what I came for.

1625
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:52,877
I didn't finish.

1626
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,680
I'm so sorry.

1627
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:02,783
Um...

1628
01:26:04,086 --> 01:26:05,819
Good-bye.

1629
01:26:05,821 --> 01:26:07,554
Good-bye, Michael.

1630
01:26:07,556 --> 01:26:09,556
Thank you for everything.

1631
01:26:09,558 --> 01:26:12,492
Thank you for letting me have a little fun.

1632
01:26:12,494 --> 01:26:16,095
Good-bye, my battling friend.

1633
01:26:16,097 --> 01:26:18,697
Good-bye, world's biggest angel.

1634
01:26:18,699 --> 01:26:21,099
Godspeed.

1635
01:26:21,101 --> 01:26:23,000
Ohh.

1636
01:27:43,915 --> 01:27:45,014
You're late.

1637
01:27:45,016 --> 01:27:46,181
I know.

1638
01:27:46,183 --> 01:27:47,582
Where's the angel?

1639
01:27:47,584 --> 01:27:50,051
Yeah, it was a hoax.

1640
01:27:50,053 --> 01:27:51,252
A hoax?

1641
01:27:51,254 --> 01:27:52,686
A hoax.
Definitely a hoax.

1642
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:54,187
He had detachable wings.

1643
01:27:54,189 --> 01:27:56,189
And a halo made out of pipe cleaners.

1644
01:27:56,191 --> 01:27:58,157
And he smelled of cookies.

1645
01:27:58,159 --> 01:27:59,158
Just kidding.

1646
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,760
So, I win.

1647
01:28:01,762 --> 01:28:03,962
You're fired,

1648
01:28:03,964 --> 01:28:06,364
and I get the dog.
Ha ha.

1649
01:28:06,366 --> 01:28:07,965
Come here, Sparky.

1650
01:28:07,967 --> 01:28:09,967
Come on, my little sausage.

1651
01:28:09,969 --> 01:28:11,501
You come to your daddy.

1652
01:28:11,503 --> 01:28:13,169
Come on... ow!

1653
01:28:13,171 --> 01:28:14,336
Bastard!

1654
01:28:14,338 --> 01:28:16,237
Sparky, come on.

1655
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:17,438
Listen, Sparky...

1656
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,472
Sparky!

1657
01:28:18,474 --> 01:28:21,208
Don't hate me.
I love you... ow!

1658
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:22,609
Oh, gee.

1659
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:24,611
Hey, listen, get the mutt out, will you?

1660
01:28:24,613 --> 01:28:26,613
Oh, right. 
Like that dog could be gotten out,

1661
01:28:26,615 --> 01:28:28,014
like that dog can do anything.

1662
01:28:28,016 --> 01:28:29,982
That is the worst dog
I think I've ever met.

1663
01:28:29,984 --> 01:28:31,917
I thought you said
you could train any dog.

1664
01:28:31,919 --> 01:28:33,251
She was wrong.

1665
01:28:33,253 --> 01:28:36,020
Are you saying I'm stuck with 
these two because of a dog?

1666
01:28:36,022 --> 01:28:39,023
You're stuck with Mr. Driscoll, not with me.

1667
01:28:39,025 --> 01:28:42,359
We met a guy with a 2-headed chicken
outside of cedar rapids.

1668
01:28:42,361 --> 01:28:44,394
Yeah. Yeah.

1669
01:28:44,396 --> 01:28:45,995
Hey, where are you going?

1670
01:28:45,997 --> 01:28:47,997
Hey! Quinlan!

1671
01:28:47,999 --> 01:28:49,965
Hey! Hey, Quinlan!

1672
01:28:49,967 --> 01:28:51,833
Where are you going?

1673
01:28:51,835 --> 01:28:53,968
Hey! Get off of me!

1674
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:56,370
Get... get back!

1675
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:58,472
Listen, Quinlan, forget
what I said. Don't...

1676
01:28:58,474 --> 01:29:00,240
don't take it personally.

1677
01:29:00,242 --> 01:29:02,108
You're the best reporter I have.

1678
01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:03,509
I'm out of here.

1679
01:29:04,345 --> 01:29:05,811
Hey!

1680
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:13,251
So you're just going to leave?

1681
01:29:13,253 --> 01:29:15,119
You don't want to talk about it?

1682
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:16,353
Nope.

1683
01:29:16,355 --> 01:29:18,755
Hey, come on, talk to me, eh?

1684
01:29:18,757 --> 01:29:21,657
Well, disagree with me.
Argue me out of it.

1685
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:23,392
All right, let's have a fight.

1686
01:29:23,394 --> 01:29:25,193
Come on, fight me, eh?

1687
01:29:25,195 --> 01:29:29,396
Hey, Quinlan, you're the only one
that ever fought with me here.

1688
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:31,631
Well, who am I going to fight with?

1689
01:29:31,633 --> 01:29:33,232
You got to help me out here.

1690
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:35,067
It isn't my area.

1691
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:36,468
Wait!

1692
01:29:44,877 --> 01:29:46,276
I'm sorry.

1693
01:29:46,278 --> 01:29:48,678
Please stop.

1694
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:52,682
Please stop and talk to me.

1695
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:56,152
I appreciate what you said up there.
I thank you.

1696
01:29:56,154 --> 01:29:57,353
I'll see you around.

1697
01:29:57,355 --> 01:29:58,520
You said...

1698
01:29:58,522 --> 01:30:01,890
You said you could
forgive me anything.

1699
01:30:01,892 --> 01:30:03,892
I forgive you.

1700
01:30:03,894 --> 01:30:05,827
We had a good time.

1701
01:30:05,829 --> 01:30:08,029
What are you so upset about?

1702
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:10,031
Oh.

1703
01:30:10,033 --> 01:30:11,865
It's you.

1704
01:30:13,902 --> 01:30:15,635
I remember you.

1705
01:30:15,637 --> 01:30:17,903
I thought you were gone.

1706
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:39,321
¶ I took a trip on a train ¶

1707
01:30:39,323 --> 01:30:41,456
¶ and I thought about you ¶

1708
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:43,858
Come on in, Rhoda.

1709
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,794
¶ I passed a shadowy Lane ¶

1710
01:30:46,796 --> 01:30:51,130
¶ and I thought about you ¶

1711
01:30:52,066 --> 01:30:56,968
¶ 2 or 3 cars parked under the stars... ¶

1712
01:30:56,970 --> 01:30:58,970
Uh, good evening. <i>Buona sera.</i>

1713
01:30:58,972 --> 01:31:03,740
Um, for our specialties tonight, we... 
we have angel hair pasta

1714
01:31:03,742 --> 01:31:06,743
with a pomodoro sauce,

1715
01:31:06,745 --> 01:31:11,213
uh, cappellini primavera,
a melange of vegetables

1716
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:13,515
over angel hair pasta,

1717
01:31:13,517 --> 01:31:18,486
and finally, a light sauce
with lemon and parsley

1718
01:31:18,488 --> 01:31:21,955
tossed with angel hair pasta.

1719
01:31:21,957 --> 01:31:22,889
Anything else?

1720
01:31:22,891 --> 01:31:25,958
Yes, we want one
pumpkin nut muffin,

1721
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,492
and...

1722
01:31:27,494 --> 01:31:29,894
A piece of angel food cake.

1723
01:31:29,896 --> 01:31:33,363
They don't have angel food cake, do you?

1724
01:31:33,365 --> 01:31:34,530
No.

1725
01:31:34,532 --> 01:31:36,532
¶ And what did I do? ¶

1726
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:40,235
¶ I thought about you ¶

1727
01:31:45,775 --> 01:31:49,176
¶ and I thought about you ¶

1728
01:31:54,249 --> 01:31:57,516
¶ and I thought about you ¶

1729
01:31:57,518 --> 01:32:00,852
¶ there were 2 or 3 cars ¶

1730
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:03,387
¶ parked under the stars ¶

1731
01:32:03,389 --> 01:32:06,056
¶ a winding stream ¶

1732
01:32:07,059 --> 01:32:09,259
¶ the moon shining down on ¶

1733
01:32:09,261 --> 01:32:10,793
¶ some little town ¶

1734
01:32:10,795 --> 01:32:13,162
¶ and with each beam ¶

1735
01:32:13,164 --> 01:32:16,130
¶ the same old dream ¶

1736
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:23,803
¶ so I thought about you ¶

1737
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:30,041
¶ and I really felt good ¶

1738
01:32:30,043 --> 01:32:33,044
¶ and then I'd peek through the crack ¶

1739
01:32:33,046 --> 01:32:35,780
¶ and I looked in that track ¶

1740
01:32:35,782 --> 01:32:39,383
¶ the one going back to you ¶

1741
01:32:39,385 --> 01:32:42,652
¶ and what did I do? ¶

1742
01:32:44,722 --> 01:32:49,991
¶ I thought about you ¶

1743
01:32:54,062 --> 01:32:57,930
So, did you ever
tell anyone about, uh...

1744
01:33:01,135 --> 01:33:02,701
I was going to.

1745
01:33:02,703 --> 01:33:06,704
Oh, I couldn't wait to get home to tell Valerie.

1746
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:09,940
And then I opened my mouth,

1747
01:33:09,942 --> 01:33:12,742
and the words wouldn't come out.

1748
01:33:12,744 --> 01:33:17,313
I'd take a breath, I... I... 
I even opened my mouth a second time.

1749
01:33:17,315 --> 01:33:19,348
Nothing.

1750
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:23,551
As far as I'm concerned,
it never happened.

1751
01:33:23,553 --> 01:33:25,286
Oh, but we saw it.

1752
01:33:25,288 --> 01:33:26,453
We were there.

1753
01:33:26,455 --> 01:33:28,588
It never happened.

1754
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:30,957
So what are you up to?

1755
01:33:30,959 --> 01:33:33,092
I'm back on the novel.

1756
01:33:34,962 --> 01:33:37,329
If it didn't happen, where's your raincoat?

1757
01:33:37,331 --> 01:33:39,531
"If it..." what is this?
"If it happened?"

1758
01:33:39,533 --> 01:33:40,932
If it happened, you know what?

1759
01:33:40,934 --> 01:33:42,800
Then I've got to believe that someday

1760
01:33:42,802 --> 01:33:44,234
I'm going to be walking down the street

1761
01:33:44,236 --> 01:33:48,871
and some unknown force is
going to make me turn right

1762
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,139
instead of turning left,

1763
01:33:51,141 --> 01:33:56,143
and, at that moment, a car is going 
to come around the corner

1764
01:33:56,145 --> 01:33:58,345
with the woman of my dreams in it

1765
01:33:58,347 --> 01:33:59,946
and blow a flat...

1766
01:34:03,117 --> 01:34:06,885
Right there, next to where I'm standing.

1767
01:34:08,922 --> 01:34:10,922
No.

1768
01:34:14,594 --> 01:34:16,393
It never happened.

1769
01:34:47,856 --> 01:34:50,623
Ha ha ha ha.

1770
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,224
You need any help?

1771
01:34:52,226 --> 01:34:53,225
No, thanks.

1772
01:34:53,227 --> 01:34:54,526
No, we're cool.

1773
01:34:54,528 --> 01:34:56,127
Ha ha ha ha.

1774
01:36:33,758 --> 01:36:35,257
Michael!

1775
01:36:48,772 --> 01:36:50,505
Michael, wait!

1776
01:36:59,248 --> 01:37:00,580
Ohh!

1777
01:37:09,557 --> 01:37:11,089
What are you doing here?

1778
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:14,858
I live here. I live 2 blocks from here.

1779
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,727
I was on my way home and...

1780
01:37:17,729 --> 01:37:20,029
I thought I saw...

1781
01:37:20,031 --> 01:37:21,630
He came around this corner.

1782
01:37:21,632 --> 01:37:24,065
That corner.

1783
01:37:35,611 --> 01:37:37,911
I love you, Dorothy.

1784
01:37:39,814 --> 01:37:42,347
I love you.

1785
01:37:45,685 --> 01:37:47,618
Marry me.

1786
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:50,120
No.

1787
01:37:51,123 --> 01:37:52,856
Marry me, please?

1788
01:37:52,858 --> 01:37:54,557
No.

1789
01:37:54,559 --> 01:37:57,293
Marry me, Dorothy.

1790
01:37:57,295 --> 01:37:58,427
No.

1791
01:37:58,429 --> 01:38:00,095
Ha ha ha ha.

1792
01:38:00,097 --> 01:38:02,964
Oh, my darling Dorothy,
will you marry me?

1793
01:38:02,966 --> 01:38:05,499
Yes. Yes.

1794
01:38:14,976 --> 01:38:17,109
Let's go home.

1795
01:38:34,127 --> 01:38:37,594
You know, Pansy,
I invented marriage.

1796
01:38:37,596 --> 01:38:38,728
Michael.

1797
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:40,262
Well, I did.

1798
01:38:40,264 --> 01:38:42,530
Before that, you should have seen it.

1799
01:38:42,532 --> 01:38:45,132
Everybody was so mixed up,
they didn't know what to do.

1800
01:38:45,134 --> 01:38:48,335
So I said: "have a ceremony."

1801
01:38:48,337 --> 01:38:50,337
Hmm.

1802
01:38:50,339 --> 01:38:52,272
Let's go home.

1803
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:08,020
¶ From the dark end of the street ¶

1804
01:39:08,022 --> 01:39:10,022
Do you smell something?

1805
01:39:10,024 --> 01:39:11,424
There's a bakery near here.

1806
01:39:11,425 --> 01:39:14,292
¶ To the bright side of the road ¶

1807
01:39:16,562 --> 01:39:19,195
¶ we'll be lovers once again ¶

1808
01:39:19,197 --> 01:39:22,531
¶ on the bright side of the road ¶

1809
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:30,538
¶ little darlin', come with me ¶

1810
01:39:32,909 --> 01:39:35,709
¶ won't ya help me share my load? ¶

1811
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:41,181
¶ from the dark end of the street ¶

1812
01:39:41,183 --> 01:39:44,317
¶ to the bright side of the road ¶

1813
01:39:47,455 --> 01:39:51,022
¶ and into this life we're born ¶

1814
01:39:52,825 --> 01:39:55,225
¶ baby, sometimes ¶

1815
01:39:55,227 --> 01:39:58,427
¶ sometimes we don't know why ¶

1816
01:39:59,596 --> 01:40:03,330
¶ and time seems to go by so fast ¶

1817
01:40:05,067 --> 01:40:08,601
¶ in the twinkling of an eye ¶

1818
01:40:10,938 --> 01:40:13,338
¶ let's enjoy it while we can ¶

1819
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:16,341
¶ let's enjoy it while we can ¶

1820
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:19,210
¶ won't ya help me share my load? ¶

1821
01:40:19,212 --> 01:40:21,612
¶ help me share my load ¶

1822
01:40:21,614 --> 01:40:24,615
¶ from the dark end of the street ¶

1823
01:40:24,617 --> 01:40:27,751
¶ to the bright side of the road ¶

1824
01:40:30,889 --> 01:40:32,889
¶ oh, we'll be ¶

1825
01:40:32,891 --> 01:40:35,291
¶ lovers once again ¶

1826
01:40:35,293 --> 01:40:38,560
¶ on the bright side of the road ¶

1827
01:40:47,869 --> 01:40:49,835
¶ We were dreamin' ¶

1828
01:40:49,837 --> 01:40:51,970
¶ on a park bench ¶

1829
01:40:51,972 --> 01:40:56,240
¶ about a broad highway somewhere ¶

1830
01:40:56,242 --> 01:40:58,242
¶ when the music ¶

1831
01:40:58,244 --> 01:41:00,244
¶ from the carillon ¶

1832
01:41:00,246 --> 01:41:04,380
¶ seemed to hurl your heart out there ¶

1833
01:41:04,382 --> 01:41:09,251
¶ that's the scientific darkness ¶

1834
01:41:09,253 --> 01:41:13,254
¶ that's the fireflies that float ¶

1835
01:41:13,256 --> 01:41:15,256
¶ to an angel ¶

1836
01:41:15,258 --> 01:41:21,862
¶ bending down to wrap you
in his warmest coat ¶

1837
01:41:21,864 --> 01:41:23,430
¶ and you ask ¶

1838
01:41:23,432 --> 01:41:26,032
¶ what am I not doing? ¶

1839
01:41:26,034 --> 01:41:30,135
¶ he says your voice cannot come in ¶

1840
01:41:30,137 --> 01:41:34,873
¶ but in time, you will move mountains ¶

1841
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:38,276
¶ it will come ¶

1842
01:41:38,278 --> 01:41:41,412
¶ through your hands ¶

1843
01:41:47,286 --> 01:41:51,554
¶ so whatever your hands
find to do ¶

1844
01:41:51,556 --> 01:41:55,691
¶ you must do
with all your heart ¶

1845
01:41:55,693 --> 01:42:00,595
¶ there are thoughts enough
to blow men's minds ¶

1846
01:42:00,597 --> 01:42:04,465
¶ and tear great worlds apart ¶

1847
01:42:04,467 --> 01:42:08,701
¶ there's a healin' touch
to find you ¶

1848
01:42:08,703 --> 01:42:13,038
¶ on that broad highway
somewhere ¶

1849
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:17,575
¶ to lift you
high as music flyin' ¶

1850
01:42:17,577 --> 01:42:21,312
¶ through the angel's hair ¶

1851
01:42:21,314 --> 01:42:25,315
¶ so don't ask
what you are not doin' ¶

1852
01:42:25,317 --> 01:42:30,053
¶ because your voice
cannot come in ¶

1853
01:42:30,055 --> 01:42:34,056
¶ in time, you will move mountains ¶

1854
01:42:34,058 --> 01:42:38,059
¶ it will come ¶

1855
01:42:38,061 --> 01:42:44,765
¶ through your hands ¶

1856
01:42:50,604 --> 01:42:52,604
¶ Now, ain't it a shame ¶

1857
01:42:52,606 --> 01:42:56,740
¶ all the tears
that people cry? ¶

1858
01:42:56,742 --> 01:43:01,677
¶ we ain't got it right
in all of these years ¶

1859
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,345
Sorry, man.

1860
01:43:03,347 --> 01:43:05,947
¶ There must be a way ¶

1861
01:43:05,949 --> 01:43:09,750
¶ to live a better life ¶

1862
01:43:09,752 --> 01:43:14,954
¶ and break all these chains
and get out of here ¶

1863
01:43:14,956 --> 01:43:18,223
¶ you've got to love God ¶

1864
01:43:18,225 --> 01:43:21,460
¶ you've got to love yourself ¶

1865
01:43:21,462 --> 01:43:25,463
¶ you've got to
love your brothers ¶

1866
01:43:25,465 --> 01:43:27,865
¶ and everybody else ¶

1867
01:43:27,867 --> 01:43:30,868
¶ you've got to walk that walk ¶

1868
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:34,471
¶ you can't just talk that talk ¶

1869
01:43:34,473 --> 01:43:38,341
¶ you've got to love God ¶

1870
01:43:38,343 --> 01:43:42,077
¶ and everybody else ¶

1871
01:43:42,079 --> 01:43:44,479
¶ heard some people say ¶

1872
01:43:44,481 --> 01:43:48,482
¶ that all we need is love ¶

1873
01:43:48,484 --> 01:43:50,484
¶ it sounds so simple ¶

1874
01:43:50,486 --> 01:43:53,620
¶ but it's true ¶

1875
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:57,490
¶ well, maybe today ¶

1876
01:43:57,492 --> 01:44:01,493
¶ we will rain down love from above ¶

1877
01:44:01,495 --> 01:44:05,896
¶ and wash us clean
and make us new ¶

1878
01:44:05,898 --> 01:44:09,899
¶ but you've got to love God ¶

1879
01:44:09,901 --> 01:44:12,768
¶ you've got to love yourself ¶

1880
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:17,105
¶ you've got to love,
love, love, love God ¶

1881
01:44:17,107 --> 01:44:20,108
¶ and everybody else ¶

1882
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:23,111
¶ hey, I want to believe ¶

1883
01:44:23,113 --> 01:44:24,378
¶ I got to believe ¶

1884
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:25,512
¶ want to be true ¶

1885
01:44:25,514 --> 01:44:27,514
¶ I want to be true ¶

1886
01:44:27,516 --> 01:44:29,516
¶ I want to see a miracle ¶

1887
01:44:29,518 --> 01:44:34,120
¶ I want you to see it, too ¶

1888
01:44:34,122 --> 01:44:36,122
¶ now ¶

1889
01:44:36,124 --> 01:44:37,523
¶ love God ¶

1890
01:44:37,525 --> 01:44:40,526
¶ I want to love my neighbor ¶

1891
01:44:40,528 --> 01:44:44,529
¶ you've got to love God ¶

1892
01:44:44,531 --> 01:44:49,233
¶ and everybody else... ¶
