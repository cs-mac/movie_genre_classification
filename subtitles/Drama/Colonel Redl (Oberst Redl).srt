1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,100
COLONEL REDL

2
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,700
Colonel Redl's story...

3
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,100
is not based on
authentic documents.

4
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
Actions of the characters
are entirely fabricated.

5
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,200
This film was inspired
by John Osborne's play
"A Patriot for Me"...

6
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
and by historical events
of our century.

7
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,900
Your grandfather was friend
of his majesty, The Emperor.

8
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,100
The Emperor once
asked him...

9
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,900
"Well, my friend,
what's new?"

10
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,600
Like the dew
from heaven sent...

11
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,500
May on him
be blessings spent.

12
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,700
May they give the strength
for all of his deeds.

13
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,000
In all lands
may he glory earn...

14
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,800
our welfare
is his one concern.

15
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,900
Woe to those
who dare reject...

16
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,300
his hand of peace,
so circumspect.

17
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,800
His holy wrath
shall strike them now...

18
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,900
with laurels
to adorn his brow.

19
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,300
Very nice, young Redl.
Sit down.

20
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,900
Maybe you'll become a great
poet of our motherland.

21
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,400
l haven't heard
such a glorious poem...

22
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,500
about His Majesty
for a long time.

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,900
Sir, this is the boy,
Alfred Redl.

24
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,700
l humbly ask
for your support...

25
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,100
to help him enter...

26
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,000
the Imperial and Royal
Cadet School.

27
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Always remember to keep
a straight posture.

28
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,800
We will be
so proud of you.

29
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,300
And we shall never forget
what the Emperor...

30
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,200
has done for us.

31
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,700
How wonderful
it would be...

32
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,100
if you would return
as an officer.

33
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,200
What an honour.

34
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,200
Your grandpa was just
a poor peasant.

35
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,800
And you suddenly
get this honour.

36
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,900
Never forget that the Emperor
made this possible.

37
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,600
Always be grateful.

38
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,400
Up, down, up, down,
up, down...

39
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,400
Hands behind your head!
Jump in place!

40
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,700
Up and in position.

41
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,200
Get ready!
Attack, defence, go!

42
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,800
Redl, Kubinyi! Be careful.

43
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,100
You'll get a beating
if you break your weapons.

44
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,600
Third grade,
stop the drill!

45
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Line up in two ranks
for punishment!

46
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,300
Redl, Kubinyi, shirts off!

47
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,900
See Redl, it's snowing.

48
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,400
Christoph Kubinyi
reporting to his grandma...

49
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,700
would like to introduce
a friend.

50
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,800
Harry! Come here, Harry!

51
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,400
Don't worry, he just wants
to make friends. Good dog.

52
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,300
Sit down! Sit down!

53
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,200
Tell me Redl, our Monarch's
empire is so vast...

54
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,100
I've a hard time telling...

55
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,500
which of the many people
of our Majesty you belong to.

56
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,300
- l was born in Galicia.
- Polish?

57
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,100
No, my father is Ukrainian,
partly of German descent.

58
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,200
l believe my mother's
grandfather was Hungarian.

59
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,500
Yes, they were Hungarians.

60
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,900
The family was noble
but lost everything.

61
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,400
Their entire estate.

62
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,300
But later His Majesty
helped them...

63
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,800
and gave them a position
in the Civil Service.

64
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,000
Fine.

65
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,500
Then you certainly have
Hungarian blood in you.

66
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Yes, my mother would always
sing a Hungarian song.

67
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,100
A Csitari Hegyek Alatti.

68
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,100
He is very nice!

69
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,000
He doesn't speak
French, grandma.

70
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
He has to learn it,
sweetie.

71
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,100
It's as important
as horseback riding.

72
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,300
But horses are the most
important, aren't they?

73
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,100
He is charming,
your little friend.

74
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,800
Come on up, Christoph,
it's a good view.

75
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,600
Yes, but do l have to
climb the tree for that?

76
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,100
You smell good, soldier,
like a foal.

77
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,700
Are you ticklish?
Let's see.

78
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,500
One, two, three, four...

79
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,400
five, six, seven...

80
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,900
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

81
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,300
Could you please help me?

82
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,900
Katalin!

83
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,900
What can we expect
from civilians...

84
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,800
if soldiers act like
animals? Is this a zoo?

85
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,700
Class raise!

86
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,100
- Are you the orderly?
- Yes, sir.

87
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,800
Who was it? File a report,
l want names.

88
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm sorry, Colonel,
l don't know who it was.

89
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,100
But l do, Cadet Redl.

90
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,500
l know the name.
Christoph von Kubinyi.

91
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Sir, I'm sure
it wasn't him.

92
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,300
- Who then?
- l don't now, l was singing.

93
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,000
Redl, report. Are they
the usual gentlemen?

94
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,700
Von Freyberg, Galliena,
von Gencsy, von Kubinyi?

95
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,500
No, it wasn't
Kubinyi, sir.

96
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,600
Who then? Redl,
I'm losing my patience.

97
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,000
Then l am forced to expel
all four of then...

98
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,400
led by Baron Kubinyi...

99
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,900
because of this
outrageous incident.

100
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,100
- l think it was von Gencsy.
- Very good, Redl.

101
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,500
You'll be a loyal soldier
to His Majesty.

102
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
You are a bright
peasant boy.

103
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,500
Dismissed!

104
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,900
Judas!

105
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,700
l am a Judas.
l am not a soldier.

106
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,000
Those over there
are soldiers.

107
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,400
l am a treacherous peasant.

108
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,700
Colonel Feldhauer wants to
see Cadet Redl in his office.

109
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,500
Well... l have to
tell you something.

110
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,800
Redl, you father has died.
Here's the telegram.

111
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,700
You'll get leave of course.
lf you should need anything...

112
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,900
money for the journey or
a wreath for the grave...

113
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,300
please tell me.
You can count on me.

114
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Colonel, may l ask for
permission to stay here...

115
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,000
l want to take part
in His Majesty's...

116
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
name-day celebration.

117
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:46,800
Now that Emperor
Franz Josef the First...

118
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,200
has become your godfather
and by the bond...

119
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,200
of our Holy Church,
you have become his sons.

120
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Our Father, Franz Josef.

121
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,400
You may call him that
from this day forward...

122
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,400
with humble pride
and the right to do so.

123
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,000
By the sacrament
of confirmation...

124
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,700
you're accepted
as his sons.

125
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,500
This will make the bond
between you all...

126
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,400
between you and the army...

127
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,400
between you and His Majesty
even more indissoluble.

128
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,300
May your filial gratitude,
your filial loyalty...

129
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:39,300
preserve this bond
with the Lord God...

130
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,800
with your Emperor and your
Motherland for all eternity.

131
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,100
Why has Detachment D...

132
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,100
still not rejoined
the main troop?

133
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,200
Lt. Schorm! Send an adjutant
to find out the reason.

134
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
l want a report.

135
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,400
The medical personnel
is still in the valley!

136
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,000
Lt. Hidegkuti! l ordered
the reserves into action...

137
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,500
to break through the enemy
lines and occupy section QX.

138
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,400
QX, yes sir.

139
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,100
Alright, then.

140
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,800
Colonel, the enemy lines have
been attacked and taken.

141
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Good, Redl.

142
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,400
You have executed this tactical
exercise perfectly.

143
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,400
This is a command post,
not the Officer's Club...

144
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,900
Where we smoke and watch
friends play pool.

145
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,400
Lt. Schorm.

146
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
The other ranks out there
may not smoke either.

147
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,100
Smoking is forbidden
on manoeuvres. Carry on.

148
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,900
Lt. Schorm, give the order
to finish.

149
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,600
Yes sir, order to finish.

150
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,100
Colonel, l gave Lt. Schorm
permission to smoke.

151
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,200
That was an error, Captain.

152
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,400
Self-control always
and everywhere.

153
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,900
We shouldn't have
compromised...

154
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,000
with the Ungarians in 1867.

155
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,400
Why not take
the whole country...

156
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,800
as the English did Ireland?

157
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,600
Without that, Austria wouldn't
be a great power now.

158
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,300
Vienna curbed us,
thanks to our politicians.

159
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,100
Kubinyi's lamenting the fate of
oppressed Hungarians again.

160
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,300
But he forgets
that Hungary, too...

161
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,800
oppresses it's
neighbouring peoples.

162
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,100
Everything has its price.

163
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,400
Arad and Haynau, generals
executed like criminals!

164
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
Come on, Kubinyi...

165
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,500
The compromise
was a great deed.

166
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,300
Redl, you look so sad.

167
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,600
- Perhaps because of you.
- Don't be sad because of me.

168
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,400
Let's drink to the health
of Captain Redl.

169
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,000
- Let's drink to it!
- Do you like him?

170
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
- Yes, he's very nice.
- You hear, old man?

171
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,500
She likes you, so drink!

172
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,800
Drink from the bottle.

173
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,400
What l put in my hand,
l put in my mouth.

174
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Should l hold it?

175
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,900
This Redl was born
in Lemberg, wasn't he?

176
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,400
And you in Pomerania.

177
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,900
- You think it's all the same?
- It damn well is!

178
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Oh, you are a cosmopolitan.

179
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,200
No, Hungarian. Secondly,
an officer and Redl's friend.

180
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,500
What did His Majesty say?

181
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,100
"The Hungarians,
a beloved nation!"

182
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,400
Are you trying
to provoke me?

183
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,000
No, why should l?

184
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,300
Let's go.

185
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,400
Baron, are you being
unfaithful to me?

186
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,000
Indeed.

187
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,200
Jealous?

188
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,400
l don't know you yet,
but it can soon be arranged.

189
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,200
Do you wanna come with me,
or prefer to sit and stare?

190
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,700
Have you ever done it?

191
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,000
Or is your biggest thrill
to shout at you soldiers?

192
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,600
What's special about Kubinyi
that make you all crazy?

193
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,200
He not only knows how to do,
he likes doing it.

194
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,200
- What?
- Everything.

195
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,600
- Then teach me, too.
- You can't teach that.

196
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,900
- You have it, or not.
- Kubinyi is handsome.

197
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,300
And wonderful.

198
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,900
What do you like best?
His hairy behind?

199
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,400
Yes. He has a lovely
little rock-hard bottom.

200
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,100
And muscular thighs.
Just like a little boy.

201
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,200
One has something
to hold on to.

202
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,700
- The scar on his knee?
- Yes, l like that, too.

203
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,500
How does he do it?
Quickly? Slowly? Rough...

204
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,000
- or gentle?
- Is he gentle?

205
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,300
No, he comes in, grabs hold
of me and my breasts...

206
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,100
and he bites.
And l bite him, too.

207
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,200
So, he bites?

208
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,900
And you?

209
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,000
How do you want to do it?

210
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,300
Are you really related?

211
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Then watch how your
big brother does it.

212
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,100
It happens during a parade.

213
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,400
I'll rode up
to colonel von Roden...

214
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,100
and report to him
on horseback.

215
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,900
l said: "One, my mother's
parents were Jewish.

216
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,300
Two, my father was
a Jew from Budapest."

217
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,200
Just imagine
von Roden's face.

218
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,900
At a parade,
with all sorts...

219
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,000
of distinguished
people present.

220
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Consuls, Attachés
and the Goszleth.

221
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,800
Daughters,
Dominika and Daniela.

222
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Alfred, I'll tell it
to them straight one day.

223
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Don't you think they know
you're a Jew?

224
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,900
I'm not just a Jew.
I'm a Hungarian Jew.

225
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,900
We can talk about it,
not just in whispers.

226
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,900
My father fought for Hungarian
freedom and was exiled.

227
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,300
My father played cards with
the Rabbi of Lemberg.

228
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,400
They were good friends.

229
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,700
How about becoming a Jew?
It would be much simpler.

230
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,500
All right, then I'm a Jew.
It's all the same.

231
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,300
You know, l think your
holidays are beautiful.

232
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,800
Yom Kippur, Passover...

233
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Redl, I'm very fond of you.
You're so wildly ambitious.

234
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,500
Let's fight about
the Goszleth daughters.

235
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,200
Would you please
look at these drawings.

236
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,700
Who do they represent?
Or it's hard to identify?

237
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,100
You're famous for your
observation.

238
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,000
This one? Lt. Beatz?

239
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,100
- No.
- But?

240
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,600
- Captain Tannhoffer.
- And this handsome face?

241
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,200
- Kubinyi.
- And him?

242
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,900
That's myself.

243
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,100
- Continue please.
- Dr. Sonnenschein.

244
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,100
- Jaromil Schorm.
- Schorm? Jaromil?

245
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,000
Tell me, this lieutenant
here, is he a invert?

246
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
Excuse me?

247
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,400
- l mean homosexual.
- Not that l know.

248
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,900
Bohemian? Jew?

249
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,900
Major, l suggest you
to ask him yourself.

250
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,100
A straight question
will get a straight answer.

251
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,900
Your an idealist.

252
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,500
This is about debt-ridden
officers.

253
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,000
Who will protect the army
in the event of war?

254
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,600
This article appeared
in a Prague newspaper...

255
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,900
written by one "senior."

256
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,000
Do you know who hides
behind this name?

257
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Your direct inferior,
Jaromil Schorm.

258
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,600
He belongs to the army,
but talks about us.

259
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,300
Corruption, debt, cards,
booze, whores!

260
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,900
He writes that,
in the event of war...

261
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,300
the army would need
protection.

262
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,200
Schorm.
Senior... Senior!

263
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,400
Well...

264
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,400
tell me Captain, do you
still play the piano?

265
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,800
At Cadet school l took
lessons with Captain Ruzek.

266
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,100
Alright.
Keep an eye on Schorm.

267
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,300
In due time,
l want a report.

268
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,500
Tell me...

269
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,100
can you make me a list,
by this afternoon...

270
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,400
of the officers'
local contacts?

271
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,500
This Schorm!

272
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Keep him out of my sight!
He will be fired!

273
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,100
A disgusting object!

274
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,500
Outside the Club other day!
This look, this deceit...

275
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,900
And you supported him.

276
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,600
He provokes me
in my own regiment.

277
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,300
We absolutely
cannot afford...

278
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,800
to be exposed
to attacks like this!

279
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,100
l detest traitors, Captain.
Making me sick!

280
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
Kick him out...

281
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,100
or let him go voluntarily.
Just get him out of here!

282
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,800
You will do that.

283
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,100
And one more thing, Redl...

284
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,200
tell your friend Kubinyi,
to stop his '48 tirades.

285
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,400
l don't want any criticism
of the compromise, alright?

286
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Why does he always mention
Haynau when he drinks?

287
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,200
Haynau's been dead
for years!

288
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Haynau is not the Monarchy.
We are the Monarchy!

289
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,900
And so is Kubinyi.

290
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,900
We couldn't object to the
articles if they were true.

291
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,300
But they are false.

292
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:41,200
I'm ashamed that an officer
express himself in this way.

293
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,700
He lives among us,
accepts the privileges...

294
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,500
of uniform and rank,
laughs and swears like us...

295
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,000
and then it turns out,
he's not one of us.

296
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,300
Instead of talking to us,
he spies on us secretly...

297
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,300
and denounces us
under a false name.

298
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Schorm must face
the consequences...

299
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,000
and leave those
he's betrayed.

300
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Taking notes, Schorm?
l could dictate for you.

301
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,200
Gentlemen,
in my own name...

302
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,600
and that of the
officers regiment...

303
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,000
l suggest that Lt. Schorm,
at his own request...

304
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,700
should leave the
regiment and the army.

305
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,500
Schorm, l...

306
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,700
Go voluntarily. You can
state the reasons yourself.

307
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,900
Yes.

308
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:44,500
Gentlemen, is this a big
moment or a small one?

309
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
l can't tell.

310
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,400
- This is not a cabaret!
- You're right, doctor.

311
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Brief and soldierly.

312
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,600
What's going on? Has our
Bohemian gone crazy?

313
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,100
Schorm, if you expect
a certificate...

314
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,300
saying that you've
gone insane...

315
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,300
which l personally agree,
you're mistaken. No!

316
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,200
Lieutenant,
name your seconds.

317
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,700
l consider the desecration
of His Majesty uniform...

318
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,500
a personal insult.

319
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,900
l therefore challenge you
to a duel!

320
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,600
Shooting?
You're near-sighted.

321
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Want to fence?

322
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,100
But don't confuse fencing
with an appendectomy.

323
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,500
Don't take this personally,
but everybody knows that...

324
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,700
doctors who join the army
aren't the best ones.

325
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,300
Summa cum laude, you jerk.
Who will be my seconds?

326
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,100
I'm not fighting you.

327
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,500
I'm the third-best shooter
in the regiment.

328
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,700
Allow me to send
for my civilian clothes.

329
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,700
The duel takes place
at dawn.

330
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,500
I'll choose my seconds
among you.

331
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Sonnenschein,
l said there won't be a duel.

332
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,900
l will take off my uniform.

333
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,300
But l can't duel
with a Jewish doctor.

334
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,100
You're not from whom one
may expect satisfaction.

335
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,700
And me, Schorm?

336
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,300
Do l meet your
high requirements?

337
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,800
Baron Kubinyi...
yes, you do.

338
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,200
But gentlemen,
this is really...

339
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,600
Done!
Tomorrow at dawn.

340
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,200
With a bullet, since you're
such a fine shooter.

341
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,600
3 steps, 3 exchanges.
Redl, you're my second.

342
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,400
Excuse me.
l hate early rising.

343
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,700
I'd prefer noon
or afternoon.

344
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,400
But honour come first.

345
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,900
Pistols at dawn, then.

346
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,500
- Those articles, Schorm...
- I'm sorry.

347
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,100
You were such
an excellent soldier.

348
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,300
The duel is nonsense.

349
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,400
- Let it go.
- l didn't force it.

350
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,600
- Then I'll lock you up.
- It's too late, Captain.

351
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,300
I'm duelling as a civilian
with Kubinyi.

352
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,100
Lock him up, if you fear
for his life.

353
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,100
The army is not
dismissing you.

354
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
You are leaving the army.

355
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,400
- In two or three years...
- Two or three years?

356
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,700
Where will
this army be then?

357
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,400
It will be at its post
and so will l.

358
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,200
Do you know what l hate
most about this army?

359
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,400
Getting up so damned early.

360
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,400
- Who's there? Who is it?
- Redl.

361
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
It's you, Schorm.

362
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,200
l thought it was you.
Sorry.

363
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,800
- You're here early.
- Yes.

364
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,800
l couldn't sleep.

365
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,000
- Could you?
- l never sleep well.

366
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
Kubinyi probably
sleep like a dog.

367
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,300
Don't underestimate him.
Cigarette?

368
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,600
No, thanks.

369
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,100
He overestimates himself.

370
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,700
- You are full of energy.
- And you?

371
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,900
l don't belong with you.

372
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,300
What do you mean?

373
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,200
l want to remain
Jaromil Schorm.

374
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,800
l don't understand.

375
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,400
l can't take leading
a double life...

376
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,000
everyone playing
their part perfectly.

377
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,700
Sickening. All of it.

378
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
l still don't understand.

379
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Tell me, Schorm...

380
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,300
are you really
a anti-Semite?

381
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,300
My grandmother is Jewish.
l hope that's sufficient.

382
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,700
l shouldn't have
insulted him.

383
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,700
l just enjoyed keeping
that Jew at a distance.

384
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,300
- Very possible.
- Not really my style.

385
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,500
- You play with people.
- No, you do.

386
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,900
Me?

387
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,300
Why me?

388
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,600
You're demanding
too much of yourself.

389
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:36,500
- What else can l do?
- Well, you might be right.

390
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,600
Maybe we haven't talked
enough to each other.

391
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,000
- Why couldn't you sleep?
- l don't know.

392
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,700
l think l had a dream.

393
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,500
- Do you believe in dreams?
- No.

394
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Or do l?

395
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,100
It is cold.

396
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,000
Yes.

397
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,800
- The weapons?
- Here they are.

398
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,800
- Redl will tell his dream.
- That's not of interest now.

399
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,700
- Gentlemen...
- Please, go on.

400
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,800
l ask you to discuss
your disagreement...

401
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,400
and use your weapons
symbolically.

402
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,200
l guarantee
complete secrecy.

403
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,200
Until then, l shall leave
the gymnasium.

404
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,900
Redl, stay!

405
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,200
Gentlemen, l am ready.

406
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,800
l think we must
get the doctor.

407
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,900
Yes.

408
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,500
- Was Schorm your friend?
- No, Colonel.

409
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,000
lf your part in this incident
is known...

410
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
- it will harm your career.
- I'm aware of my position.

411
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,100
We have decided to act
discreetly.

412
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,600
Thank you, Colonel.

413
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,900
With Kubinyi, it's
a different story.

414
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,400
He's been in trouble
before.

415
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,100
However, he survives such
incidents more easily.

416
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,100
Redl, l must say...

417
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,800
you were only a second,
but that was a grave error.

418
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,400
Never get involved in
anything like this again.

419
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,700
Yes, Colonel.

420
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,800
Do you think an officer
without family connections...

421
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,800
remains unnoticed?
Is that your opinion, Redl?

422
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,500
I'm convinced the army
seldom allows merit...

423
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,200
to go unacknowledged.

424
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,700
Correct, Redl,
and for obvious reasons.

425
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,400
The future of the Monarchy
and Europe...

426
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
- depends on the army.
- I've noticed that...

427
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,600
officers who complain
about privilege...

428
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,700
are of average ability,
mostly below that.

429
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,900
Exactly. A good soldier
always recognizes another.

430
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,500
That's the basis
of comradeship.

431
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,800
Redl, as a Commander...

432
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,200
l must inform
to the War Ministry...

433
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,100
about officers
of outstanding merit.

434
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,400
Your merits have surpassed
your present rank.

435
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,900
Here's your promotion
to Major.

436
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,500
And here's your order
to report to Vienna.

437
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,600
His Majesty has
appointed you...

438
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,600
second-in-command
of a garrison.

439
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:06,000
It's a pity, it had to arrive
on this unfortunate day.

440
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,900
Nevertheless,
congratulations.

441
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,100
Thank you, Colonel.

442
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:15,100
It means a great deal to me.
After all, l trained you.

443
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,700
That's the way it is.

444
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:27,700
A wallet and a briefcase.
l had them made in Vienna.

445
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,300
A.R.

446
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,300
l grew very fond of you,
my son.

447
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,500
Dismissed!

448
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,200
Colonel...

449
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,300
I'd like to take
Lt. Von Kubinyi with me.

450
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,700
He's a good soldier.

451
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,000
An odd team, you two.

452
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm not sure it will
help you, but...

453
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,800
It can be arranged
through his...

454
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,100
family connections
in Vienna.

455
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,700
- Katalin, did you see him?
- Who?

456
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,800
The Emperor,
admiring the view?

457
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,900
He has a hunting
lodge here.

458
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,300
The Emperor!

459
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,900
What if we'd stopped
to greet him?

460
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,600
What would you have said?

461
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,200
"Major Redl
begs to report?"

462
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,200
I'd have wished him good
health and a long life.

463
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,300
Wait, turn in to the Inn.

464
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,700
I'm tired, Major.
We'll take a room.

465
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,900
l can't believe l saw
the Emperor today.

466
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,300
Come here.

467
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,900
Horse and saddle,
a fine soldierly smell.

468
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,700
Christoph never smells
like a soldier.

469
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,400
Do you smell
the soldier on him?

470
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,300
Me?

471
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,700
Here you are, madam.

472
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,900
Soldier,
uncork the champagne.

473
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,000
I've made a lovely,
big bridal bed for us.

474
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,700
What will your husband say
if you don't come home?

475
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,500
I'm sleeping at my mother.
You're my witness.

476
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,300
I've neither time
nor inclination...

477
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,500
to be a gracious
society hostess.

478
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,800
l like riding,
eating, drinking.

479
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,500
Why don't you have
any children?

480
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,600
We just don't.

481
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,300
l can't stand
my husband anymore.

482
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,800
Shall l marry you? Do you
want a pretty Kubinyi?

483
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,000
You deserve it.

484
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,800
Let's drink.

485
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,500
Why do you close your eyes?

486
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,600
l don't know.

487
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,500
Are you thinking of
someone else?

488
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,000
Yes.

489
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,200
- Christoph?
- Yes.

490
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,600
Were you always
thinking of him?

491
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,000
Whom do you love more?
Whom?

492
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,300
- I'm very fond of you both.
- And now?

493
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:42,000
l feel fine, but l don't
know for how long.

494
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
You know,
Christoph and l...

495
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,100
we're...

496
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,400
actually,
I'm afraid of him.

497
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,000
- But now you're over him.
- No.

498
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,500
You're wonderful Katalin.
l like touching you.

499
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,100
l have nobody l can
embrace, just you.

500
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Don't forget, you're here
in Galicia...

501
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,600
not by the Adriatic.

502
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,500
We have many Poles, Jews,
gypsies, thieves and whores.

503
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,200
Be on your guard.

504
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,800
Many of them smuggle vodka
across the border.

505
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,200
We are right at the border,
not Bad Ischl or Alt-Ausee.

506
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,600
There's so little to do...

507
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,300
the officers
go hunting for chamois.

508
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,000
You get my meaning.

509
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,100
Lt. Ehrlich reporting.

510
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,500
Manoeuvres proceeding
according to plan.

511
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,000
Major, Lt. Mészaros
reporting.

512
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,300
Manoeuvres proceeding
as planned.

513
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,700
Throw grenades!

514
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,700
Up!

515
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,400
Fire! Throw grenades!

516
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,200
Up! Stop! Go back!

517
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:13,000
Didn't you instruct your men
in the use of grenades...

518
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,900
unexploded grenades
or those falling short?

519
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,800
Assemble the platoon!

520
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:27,500
Throw away your cigarette.
Repeat the regulations.

521
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,900
I'm sorry, l don't know
them all.

522
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,400
Not all? Item one?

523
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,400
Item two? Three? Five?

524
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,100
Your order, officer?

525
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:48,200
- A schnapps, please.
- Coming right up, Major.

526
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,300
You get many officers here,
don't you?

527
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,300
- How did you guess?
- You knew my rank.

528
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,000
You recognize ranks when
you're as old as me...

529
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,200
but you never know people.
I'll get your drink.

530
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,200
- And vodka?
- No, that's contraband.

531
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,200
Maybe a glass of aquavit?

532
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,800
We're serving His Majesty
on the Russian border.

533
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:23,800
We're not here to impress
or chase the women...

534
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,700
play pool and get drunk,
on duty or on manoeuvres.

535
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,100
I'm referring
to Lt. Schinszky.

536
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,100
Our men blow
themselves up...

537
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,500
due to a lack of
grenade instruction.

538
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,300
Lt. Mészaros is not here
to fall off his horse...

539
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,900
drunk at 11 am.

540
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,900
Contraband vodka,
drunk at the Inn...

541
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,900
where you go to keep warm,
while your men train outside.

542
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,200
And by noon you are kept in
the saddle by their horses.

543
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,800
We are not here to dishonour
the Emperor's uniform...

544
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,800
by making deals
with civilians...

545
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
like Kferrer and Halmi...

546
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
getting involved
in God knows what.

547
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,700
We're not here to seduce
a girl a week...

548
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,200
meaning raping her
in the woods.

549
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,200
Like a poor servant-girl
who dares not say a word...

550
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,300
for everyone would believe
the almighty officer.

551
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,300
Almighty officers, indeed!

552
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,300
Officers of the Monarchy...

553
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,100
must set a good example
so the people trust us...

554
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,000
and know the Emperor
will protect them.

555
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,700
My question is,
does the Monarchy...

556
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,800
need each one of you
personally...

557
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,400
here in this garrison?

558
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,800
Answer the question
yourselves. I'm waiting.

559
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,600
lf you think your presence
here has a meaning...

560
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:07,500
then you know
that with your rights...

561
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,400
you have certain
obligations.

562
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,000
Only then can you
claim privileges.

563
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You need not be
Imperial Army officers.

564
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,700
The post office
or the railways...

565
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,500
guarantees a pension.

566
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,600
Colonel Ruzitska wishes to
see you in the conservatory.

567
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,500
Colonel?

568
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,500
l have bad news
for you, Redl.

569
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,000
When did you
last see Mészaros?

570
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,100
This afternoon,
during the manoeuvres.

571
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,300
- He has deserted.
- Really?

572
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,200
To the Russians.

573
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,000
Tonight at six he appeared on
the other side of the barrier.

574
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,500
And shouted
to our soldiers...

575
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,900
"Say 'hello' to Mr. Ruzistka
and Redl for me!"

576
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,700
And then he did this.

577
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,000
I've had enough of
the Russians border.

578
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,700
I'm applying
for retirement.

579
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,700
I'd like to recommend you
as District Commandant.

580
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,300
You have a great future.

581
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,800
l was no more than a troop
commander. That's fate.

582
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,300
One doesn't necessarily have
to be on the General Staff.

583
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,200
These damned Habsburgs!

584
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,000
l hate this Habsburgs,
do you hear? l hate them!

585
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,200
What do you think of them?

586
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,600
Maybe you think
they're wonderful.

587
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:17,200
But I'm drunk tonight,
so l must tell you honestly.

588
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,100
You can have them.
l hate them!

589
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,500
Galicia and Cracow would
join Poland so fast...

590
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,900
Vienna would be left
gasping.

591
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,900
And our Monarchy?

592
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,300
It would vanish
from the map of Europe.

593
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,300
This Empire can only
be saved by war.

594
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,700
But after so many
lost battles...

595
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,300
the senile Emperor
has to go first.

596
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,100
Are you crazy?

597
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,900
Trying to play switchman,
are you?

598
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:52,700
I'm forced to put you on
increased duty for one week.

599
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,500
Dismissed.

600
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,200
- Yes.
- It's Alfred.

601
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,300
Are you busy?

602
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,500
- What do you want?
- To talk.

603
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,500
I'm expecting someone
who wouldn't like to see you.

604
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,000
Duty inspection.

605
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,100
- Major, the password please.
- "Schenitterin ruht."

606
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,900
- Who is the duty officer?
- Lt. Kubinyi, sir.

607
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,000
Where is he? Where?

608
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,800
He fell asleep
in the cafeteria.

609
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,700
- Why didn't you wake him?
- l did.

610
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:59,000
- Why isn't he here then?
- He said, sir...

611
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,800
he told me to go to hell.

612
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,700
I'll take over.

613
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,000
A serious breach of duty.

614
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,900
At war, you would be
court-martialled.

615
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,600
- Understood, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Colonel.

616
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,500
I'm now forced to
transfer you.

617
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:20,000
Within 24 hours you'll report
to Helmut Haynert...

618
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,700
at the War Ministry.

619
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,900
He already knows.

620
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,600
Your future
will be decided in Vienna.

621
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,800
Oh, you fools.
Dismissed.

622
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,200
A farewell drink.

623
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm almost sorry for you.

624
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,300
l wonder if Redl's a Jew...

625
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:52,200
but instead of a caftan,
he wears uniform.

626
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,400
A great camouflage.

627
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,300
Redl will soon be
on the General Staff.

628
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,000
A Jew on the General Staff?.

629
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,600
Our top moron already is
in the hands...

630
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,200
of the Rothschild family.

631
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,800
l didn't thank Redl
for this trip.

632
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:10,400
Watch him, he might be
useful to us.

633
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,100
Go away.

634
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,400
Get lost!

635
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,300
Go!

636
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,700
Go away!
What do you want from me?

637
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,900
What do you want from me?

638
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,200
Major, may l ask you,
are you also a Jew?

639
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,600
Through your mother?

640
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,500
Several people have say so.

641
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,900
l also heard, you don't like
to mention it.

642
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,200
Maybe you're right.

643
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,600
l won't tell anyone.
My heart's just overjoyed.

644
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,400
- May l sit down, Major?
- Please.

645
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:56,000
lf you excuse me, Major...

646
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,700
my wife would like to
invite you...

647
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,700
to our Friday night supper.

648
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:08,000
Lt. Ehrlich feels quite
at home with us, too.

649
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,500
A large family and
beautiful children, Major.

650
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,100
Don't!
Don't touch me!

651
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,500
l have to warn you,
Lt. Ehrlich...

652
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,000
and all other gentlemen,
including our doctor...

653
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,100
that close contact with
the Jews is to be avoided.

654
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,300
Our supreme Commander,
His Majesty...

655
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,700
allows Jewish soldiers...

656
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,000
to entry into the Officer
Corps of the Royal Army.

657
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,600
lf most comfortable with
junk merchants in a caftan...

658
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,600
you shouldn't be
in uniform.

659
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,800
There's something else.

660
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,100
Some of the Jews here...

661
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,700
no, let's say
most of the Jews here...

662
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:08,400
have trading connections
with Jews across the border.

663
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,400
Vodka, fabrics, God knows
what else is being smuggled.

664
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,900
We suspect that information
is traded as well...

665
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,600
gathered from some
officer during...

666
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,400
the family's
gefilte fish dinner.

667
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,600
We must decide.

668
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,100
Either you're an officer
of the Imperial Army...

669
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,900
or a Slovak...

670
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,400
or a Ukrainian...

671
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,700
or a Jew.

672
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,500
Dear Sonnenschein,
old doctor.

673
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,400
l haven't hear from you
for awhile.

674
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:53,100
A woman wants to see you.
She said she's your sister.

675
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,600
- What does she look like?
- She's elderly.

676
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,900
- Tell her I'm busy.
- Yes, sir.

677
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:09,600
Hold on! Send her in.

678
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,300
- Alfred?
- Soferl!

679
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,000
Soferl, what are you
doing here?

680
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Mother sends her love.
We heard you were here.

681
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,400
- From whom?
- A soldier, Schilhanek's son.

682
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:35,700
Yes, mother sends her love.
Ilse and the children, too.

683
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,600
Magda has moved
with her husband.

684
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:46,500
- Are there any problems?
- No more than usual.

685
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,400
Something important
to tell me?

686
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,600
No.

687
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,000
Please. You need money?

688
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,600
- No.
- Take it.

689
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:59,000
l can give you every month.
I'll send it to you...

690
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
or I'll bring it myself.
l don't mind.

691
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,600
Here.

692
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,800
Please don't ever
come here again.

693
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,700
You can't do that.
These are barracks!

694
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,300
This isn't like
a post office.

695
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:21,200
You shouldn't come here
using my name.

696
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,300
No.

697
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,600
Now l have to...

698
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,200
Take it. Put it away.

699
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,500
- Christoph is really hurt.
- I'm the one that's hurt.

700
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,800
He said and did things
l couldn't accept...

701
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,400
as an officer
or his friend.

702
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:15,200
Alfred, don't be ridiculous.
Stop lying to me.

703
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,100
Stop pretending
for your own sake.

704
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,700
The concept of the Monarchy
is good.

705
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:25,400
l can't imagine anything
better in its place.

706
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,400
The Emperor's old
and makes mistakes.

707
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,100
Some reforms are due.

708
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:35,200
But l must show
that from where l stand...

709
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,000
The Monarchy isn't
crumbling, but strong.

710
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,600
lf a few others
felt like me...

711
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,300
things wouldn't depend on
the old man alone.

712
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,800
Then we could save
this Monarchy.

713
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,500
Everything l can do,
l shall do.

714
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,700
And what do you
want to do?

715
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,000
And you wonder
why people hate you?

716
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,100
l know everything...

717
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,500
everything about them.

718
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,700
l can strike them down
whenever l like.

719
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:16,500
Gentlemen, will you please
line up according to rank.

720
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:22,000
By rank, l don't necessarily
mean military rank.

721
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,100
l assume you know your
closeness to Vienna...

722
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,800
although that can change.

723
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:36,200
The lower ranks should
line up according to height.

724
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,600
Short people first.
There's no disgrace.

725
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,800
The Heir-Apparent
isn't tall, either.

726
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:48,000
Neither am l, so obviously
no disadvantage here.

727
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
When the Archduke enters,
we stand to attention.

728
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,100
Receive decorations,
head high.

729
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,600
At his handshake,
bow your head.

730
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,600
You won't lose it just yet.

731
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,100
Line up now according to
your rank and position...

732
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,800
facing the door.

733
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,900
They're coming.

734
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,600
I'm glad l did transfer
you here. l really trust you.

735
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,700
The decisive factor was
you not belonging...

736
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,200
to any fraction.

737
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:30,200
We must do our duty,
independently...

738
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,100
and do the best
of our ability.

739
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:37,400
Your task is to modernize
military intelligence.

740
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,600
You've done excellent work,
but largely as an amateur.

741
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,300
From now on, you're
the number one specialist.

742
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:51,000
lf you have any problems,
come to me and I'll help.

743
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And when you become
War Minister...

744
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,100
I'll let raise my pension.

745
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,000
Just one more advice.

746
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,600
Choose subordinates
who have...

747
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,500
reason to look up to you.

748
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,700
Men who are grateful to you,
because you selected them.

749
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,800
l welcome you as members
of this newly formed office.

750
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,700
Please get to know
each other.

751
01:10:55,700 --> 01:11:00,000
Don't be bothered that you
speak different tongues.

752
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,200
Your task will be
in the provinces...

753
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,800
with people whose language
you know.

754
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,400
Our mutual task is
to preserve and protect...

755
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,200
the strength
of the Monarchy.

756
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:15,200
Whatever we say or don't say
in order to reach our goal...

757
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,800
is not lie,
but our mission. Duty.

758
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,900
We must know everything
about everyone.

759
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:24,300
The smallest town
holds people we need.

760
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,800
It's up to us entirely
to find them.

761
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,600
Suitable types abound, nearly
everyone is susceptible.

762
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:38,500
Details of our work
are strictly confidential.

763
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,700
lf you are successful...

764
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,900
you'll be praised by
nobody but me.

765
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,900
Mistakes, nobody will defend
you, the same goes for me.

766
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,500
But we belong to a group...

767
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,700
whose hand is on the pulse
of the Monarchy...

768
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:58,700
and can make decisions
in its interest.

769
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:02,600
This trust, after long
and careful consideration...

770
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,600
was lent to you.
Lent, not given.

771
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,000
As hard as it was to gain
this trust...

772
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:15,100
as easy it is to lose it.
To lose everything.

773
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,500
That's power.

774
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,700
Note everything about
every officer.

775
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:26,600
Who was he with? Where?
What did they talk about?

776
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,200
How much they spend, what
they like, their passions.

777
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,300
Which officers are
regular customers.

778
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,800
Name, rank and garrison.

779
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,400
Redl, Albert.

780
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,700
Career driven, concerned
only with his own welfare.

781
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:52,000
Likes to be considered
an aristocrat.

782
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,600
Admires power
and often stresses...

783
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,100
his gratitude
to the Habsburgs.

784
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,600
No contact with
his family...

785
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,200
and sister,
resident in Lemberg.

786
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,900
Poses.

787
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,800
Poses.

788
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,800
Insincere.

789
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,400
It's not pleasant for me
to repeat this question...

790
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:20,700
but Marshall Korad asked me
if you're homosexual.

791
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:25,100
And if l think it odd...

792
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:28,200
that even the Archduke
has made inquiries.

793
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,800
What do you say?

794
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:35,000
They're plotting
against you already.

795
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,100
Unless it's a plot
against me.

796
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:42,100
They don't dare touch me,
so they starting with you...

797
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:45,400
because they know
that I'm backing you.

798
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,800
That's the world around you.
Take stock of it.

799
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:54,700
I've got the impression
you make enemies easily.

800
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,300
Avoid that
whenever possible.

801
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,600
For my sake, too.

802
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,100
You should marry.
That would calm people down.

803
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,500
I'll introduce you to a girl
from a good Viennese family.

804
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,700
Or we'll pack our bags
and go to America.

805
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,300
Should we?

806
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,300
We may face an offensive
in the Balkans.

807
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,000
The Emperor wants peace.

808
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,500
He knows what war would do
to the Monarchy.

809
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,800
Yet he makes bad mistakes.
He puts in key positions...

810
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,600
men who represent
everything he fears.

811
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,800
The Archduke works
openly against him...

812
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,700
and he pretends
not to notice.

813
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,700
When the Emperor dies...

814
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,800
the Monarchy
will fall to pieces.

815
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,100
Look at this here,
from an earlier empire.

816
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,400
What does remain?

817
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,000
Stop that!

818
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,300
That civilian suit is the
greatest lie in your life.

819
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:09,900
l know.

820
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,400
Are you coming?

821
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,600
Of course.

822
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,300
Alfred.

823
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,500
Yes, I'm coming.

824
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,700
Welcome, Lt. Colonel.

825
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:48,100
May l check your uniform,
according to regulations?

826
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:53,500
Colonel, your sword, please.
Thank you.

827
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,600
Kindly wait a moment.

828
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,000
- Kubinyi.
- Hello, Redl.

829
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,400
l thought you were
in St. Petersburg.

830
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,400
I'm now on General Staff
for Hungarian affairs.

831
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,900
lf you need anything
from that area...

832
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,700
please come to me first.

833
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,300
And if l can do anything...

834
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,800
l don't snoop
on fellow officers.

835
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,600
Take care.

836
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,800
Lt. Colonel, His Imperial
Highness is expecting you.

837
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,500
Imperial Majesty...

838
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,000
Colonel Alfred Redl
begs to report.

839
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,900
Colonel Redl. I'm glad
we can have a talk.

840
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,200
I've heard so much
about you.

841
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,700
How do you like
your position?

842
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:19,000
Thank you, Imperial Highness.
l have a lot to do.

843
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,900
And l like to work.

844
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:25,500
Do you enjoy the power
in your hands?

845
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,100
Sometimes?
Just for a moment?

846
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:33,100
What l feel rather
is the weight of my task.

847
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,800
They say your loyalty
is unshakeable...

848
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,100
and based on gratitude.

849
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,600
You want to serve and
prove yourself, am l right?

850
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:46,100
l am deeply honoured,
if they say that about me.

851
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,900
You're a good
toll-collector, then.

852
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,900
You won't side with those
who've gained eminence...

853
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,300
by their noble blood.

854
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,800
Are you Catholic?

855
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,400
Yes.

856
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,100
We understand each other.

857
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,200
People say things
about me, too.

858
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:13,700
I've read your reports.
You write very well.

859
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:18,600
Or rather, convincingly.

860
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,700
You like to work hard...

861
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,400
like in Galacia, where
you proved your ability.

862
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,100
We'll see whether you are
just as talented here.

863
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:34,100
We have to focus on the
interests of our Manarchy.

864
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,200
World becomes dangerous.
Army morale is shaky.

865
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,500
The Imperial Army has begun
to resemble a casino...

866
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:43,200
playing pool, drinking
and chasing women, right?

867
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,000
Yes, unfortunately.

868
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,300
The spirit of liberalism
undermines everything.

869
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,500
Please, sit down.

870
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,900
In such a situation...

871
01:20:55,900 --> 01:21:01,300
one has to make a clean
sweep to restore order.

872
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,500
Don't stand there,
sit down.

873
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:13,000
The army must be as rock-hard
as ice on a frozen lake.

874
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,800
Your Highness,
fish swim under the ice.

875
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:23,000
We must take
lasting examples...

876
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,600
as your previous
activity proved.

877
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:31,100
We must arrange some actions
that will shake the army...

878
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:38,300
to take clear to all that
the liberalism must end.

879
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,700
The Emperor must see that
an effective army...

880
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,000
needs a new spirit.

881
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,800
In my view, the people
of the Monarchy...

882
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:51,800
must be shown a distinct
face of the enemy.

883
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:54,000
The picture of
a common enemy...

884
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,600
who threatens them.

885
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,400
The feeling of fear,
you see...

886
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,400
is the only thing
that makes an army tough.

887
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,900
Think it over, Colonel.

888
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:09,900
Check your files and submit
a suggestion to me, soon.

889
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,300
It should relate
to the Balkan...

890
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:16,300
and the action
of Russian forces.

891
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,500
Or possible French.

892
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,700
You have full authority.

893
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:28,400
How long have you known
Colonel von Komjathy?

894
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,300
Since l was in the 32nd
Maria Theresia Regiment.

895
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:37,800
Cognac? Grappa? Liquor?
What would you like?

896
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,200
Cognac, please, if l may.

897
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:45,700
Who are the confidants
of Colonel von Komjathy?

898
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:51,300
Komjathy?
I'm sorry, l can't remember.

899
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,900
Thank you.

900
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,500
l thought you were
a bright peasant boy.

901
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,600
Think it over.

902
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,700
Will one afternoon
be sufficient...

903
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,700
to give me
an accurate list...

904
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,700
of officers relations
in your garrison?

905
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,400
The building material
contract...

906
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,700
for the Przemysl fortress
was signed by Ullman.

907
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:56,100
The engineer responsible
was Worowka.

908
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,000
To whom did you pass
on the material?

909
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:05,300
Whom did you hand
the material? Where?

910
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
And how?

911
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,900
There are five cases at our
disposal, unfortunately...

912
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:16,900
each case amounts to
high treason.

913
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,600
l suggest
we remove a case...

914
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,900
from the military court
and make it public.

915
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,900
With special reference...

916
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:27,900
to the equality
guilty environment.

917
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,600
We do it so spectacularly...

918
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,900
that it creates tension
throughout the army...

919
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,300
and among the civilian
population.

920
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:41,100
l suggest a public trial
with press coverage...

921
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,100
and many witnesses.

922
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,000
The idea is excellent,
Redl.

923
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,800
It all depends on
the person accused.

924
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,800
l suggest either the case
of Max von Dornheim...

925
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:58,400
or Colonel György von
Komjathy, from Budapest.

926
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,600
Please.

927
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,600
Look, Lt. Colonel.

928
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,100
This trial must show
the army and the officers...

929
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,200
that the enemy's
in our ranks...

930
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,400
and that we'll
strike down anyone...

931
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,000
who neglects his duty.

932
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,500
At the same time, we must
show the whole world...

933
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,200
a united and strong
Austro-Hungarian army.

934
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,200
That's politics.

935
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,800
So, the accused
cannot be Austrian...

936
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,000
certainly not
Austrian aristocrat.

937
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,200
It'd weaken the trust
in the leadership.

938
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,000
He cannot be Hungarian...

939
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,400
since we live
in a dual Monarchy.

940
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,900
We don't want to irritate
the enemy within.

941
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:45,300
Also cannot be a Czech.
They keep demonstrating.

942
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,800
Too many
independence movements.

943
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,600
They would see
as a provocation.

944
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,900
It certainly can't be
a Jew.

945
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,200
The Dreyfus affair
enraged all of Europe.

946
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:05,100
We'd stir up an international
storm of indignation...

947
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:08,600
and upset the Emperor's
important links...

948
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,000
with the Rothschild bank.

949
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,900
And finally...

950
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:17,100
no Serb or Croat.

951
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,700
That zone is too hot and
must be tackled otherwise.

952
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:26,200
You have Hungarian
blood in you?

953
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,100
Ukrainian.

954
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,700
That's what we need,
a Ukrainian.

955
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,600
Look for a duplicate
of yourself, Redl.

956
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,200
I'd have to search Galicia.

957
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,600
Then look there.

958
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,500
Similar background,
career and connections.

959
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,500
That can't be a problem
for you.

960
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,800
You have files
on everyone...

961
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,000
with your
wide network of agents.

962
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,100
What happened?

963
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,600
I'm included in the
Archdukes schemes.

964
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,600
The bullets are whistling
past my ears.

965
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,000
Colonel, we have
the answer for you.

966
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,400
Dismissed.

967
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,200
Salapska! Salapska!
Were you asleep?

968
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:01,600
l need a special train
from the Ministry...

969
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,100
and notify
Commandant Lemberg...

970
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:06,400
to put Victor Ullman
under surveillance.

971
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,200
But not open action before
my arrival. Immediately.

972
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,200
Good evening.

973
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,800
- Are you Victor Ullman?
- Yes. How can l help you?

974
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,700
l must speak to you
in private.

975
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,100
- Why?
- Please come.

976
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,600
- This way.
- Go ahead.

977
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,900
Excuse me.

978
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,200
- Salapska.
- András!

979
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:09,200
Give me the keys to the
safe and your desk.

980
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:13,000
- May l have an explanation?
- l am searching the premises!

981
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:20,100
l could fabricate evidence
and nobody would ever know.

982
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,900
But l don't want to.
The key.

983
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,600
- l won't tolerate this!
- Give me the key. Major...

984
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,200
take Mr. Ullman next door.
I'll interrogate him later.

985
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:31,200
By the way, where's
the engineer Worowka?

986
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,100
l don't know.
In Vienna, l presume.

987
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,500
András!

988
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,700
Take him away.

989
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:49,900
Przemysl.

990
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:56,100
Major, make a list of
all firms, all engineers...

991
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,100
and their army partners.

992
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:02,100
Possible private contacts
aside from business relations.

993
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:06,100
But first a telegram
to the Vienna police.

994
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,900
"Find and arrest
engineer Worowka."

995
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:23,100
- Put it back, please.
- Leave me alone.

996
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,700
I'll have to handcuff you,
if you don't.

997
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,200
Stop! Don't move.

998
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:04,100
Stop!

999
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,800
Get a doctor, quick!

1000
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,600
Heir-Apparent.

1001
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,100
"Christoph Kubinyi,
St. Petersburg."

1002
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:36,300
Turn right, please.
Right, l said.

1003
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,500
Announce me to the General.

1004
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:19,500
The General is retired
since yesterday.

1005
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:23,000
The chief of the General Staff
handles all open cases.

1006
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,100
Understand.

1007
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,800
l understand.

1008
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,800
Please allow me,
Imperial Highness...

1009
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,300
to question
Major Christoph Kubinyi.

1010
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,500
What about?

1011
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,900
I'm sure that
engineer Worowka...

1012
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,300
and army supplier
Victor Ullman...

1013
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:58,000
conspired to pass plans
of the Przemysl fortress...

1014
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,600
to Petersburg.

1015
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,500
Galicia again.
Have you arrested them?

1016
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,200
No. Ullman
committed suicide...

1017
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,700
and Worowka
was murdered in Vienna.

1018
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:10,900
Once you go into action,
death follows.

1019
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:14,300
Przemysl. What do you want
to know from Kubinyi?

1020
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:19,000
lf Ullman had any military
diplomatic contacts.

1021
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,600
Tell me, Redl...

1022
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,500
are you a cruel man?

1023
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:31,900
Imperial Highness,
l am doing my duty.

1024
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:34,900
- What faith?
- As l told you, I'm Catholic.

1025
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:39,400
- Do you like children?
- Yes, but my wife is ill.

1026
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,200
Excuse the questions.

1027
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:45,700
l just wonder why Roden
always backed you.

1028
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:48,700
Because you graduated
with honours...

1029
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:51,400
and you're
a good mathematician?

1030
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,800
l see no point
in you interrogating...

1031
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,100
members of the
General Staff...

1032
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,000
or harassing our
most reliable men.

1033
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,500
But this concerns
high treason.

1034
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,900
l shall decide
who is the traitor!

1035
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:08,200
Przemysl is of minimal
military importance.

1036
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:12,100
The guilty have sentenced
themselves. Case closed.

1037
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:15,000
You haven't succeeded
this time.

1038
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,800
A dead duplicate
is no duplicate.

1039
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,200
Spin your web better
and do it faster...

1040
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:24,500
or will von Kubinyi
replace a Ukrainian?

1041
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:27,600
- He's not like you.
- But you misunderstand me.

1042
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:31,500
l don't misunderstand you.

1043
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:34,600
Open your eyes when you
look for the enemy, Redl.

1044
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,300
You're not senile yet...

1045
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,000
like this Roden with
his watery eyes.

1046
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Whom we finally managed...

1047
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,400
to put into well-earned
retirement.

1048
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:53,200
You admired him, or not?

1049
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:00,400
Your Highness, he indeed
was a bit emotional.

1050
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,900
Look, Redl.

1051
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,200
The Emperor's Waltz
isn't danced anymore.

1052
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:14,400
War is coming.
Can we avoid it? Maybe.

1053
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,100
However, the Monarchy
needs a spectacular case.

1054
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:20,900
A bit of a fright.

1055
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:25,900
A few days of threat and
fear, then a quick victory.

1056
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,600
War, then?

1057
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,800
A retaliation for some
assassination.

1058
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:38,300
Then a small, local war
for a couple of weeks...

1059
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:42,300
to save what can be saved.

1060
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:56,400
Mr. Redl. This profile
an extremely ruthless type.

1061
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:01,000
But something about it
suggests sensuality.

1062
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,600
- Slavic face.
- Yes, the cheekbones.

1063
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:10,300
Looking at this photo,
clearly a brutal personality.

1064
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,500
Lt. Colonel Redl.

1065
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:18,700
First we'll promote him.

1066
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:21,900
The whole thing
is monstrous treason.

1067
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:27,000
The Archduke plans a military
coup, to seize power himself.

1068
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,300
He doesn't believe
in the old Monarchy.

1069
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:32,900
The only one who does
is the Emperor.

1070
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:36,700
l hate politics!
l hate politicians!

1071
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,900
My world, yes, my world.

1072
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:45,200
Today l wish it would
fall apart.

1073
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,700
A quick hero's death. Done.

1074
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:50,400
Then we're even,
the Monarchy and l.

1075
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:55,200
I'm forty. Do l admit that
I've been on the wrong side...

1076
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,100
when all other possibilities
are just as miserable?

1077
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,000
Nothing matters, Alfred,
only life itself.

1078
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:11,700
To breathe this wonderful
morning air.

1079
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,900
It's no sin to be involved.
It's a sin to remain involved.

1080
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,300
Montaigne.

1081
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,400
l learned it
in my French Class.

1082
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,800
Why do you keep this?

1083
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:31,000
- l wanna know what he thinks.
- About you?

1084
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:37,600
l can't prevent
what's brewing up.

1085
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:41,500
What l wanted to defend
doesn't exist.

1086
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,000
l dreamt my father
sat on my shoulders...

1087
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,900
pressing me into the earth.

1088
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,500
You no more about me
than anyone else.

1089
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,500
lf you ever misuse that...

1090
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:05,400
I'll shoot you.

1091
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,000
Colonel,
it's a masked ball.

1092
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,400
Even for me?

1093
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,300
Yes, until midnight,
for everyone.

1094
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:12,300
Colonel Redl, whom we all
tear. And your wife?

1095
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,900
Unfortunately,
in a sanatorium.

1096
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:17,200
- May we ask why?
- A shadow on the lung.

1097
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:19,600
l wish her
a speedy recovery.

1098
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,200
Good evening.

1099
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,600
lf there were an explosion
in this room now...

1100
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:27,200
it'd be the solution
for Europe.

1101
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,900
And would we be
inside or outside?

1102
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:35,000
Trieste will fall to the
Italians, so don't buy it.

1103
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Every battalion's safe
has an envelope...

1104
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,600
with the secret
mobilization order.

1105
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:52,000
Colonel Redl?

1106
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,000
What do you say to that?

1107
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,600
l heard that Austria-Germany,
not Hungary...

1108
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,600
will save the Habsburgs.

1109
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,900
Katalin, dear...
excuse me.

1110
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:15,900
Would you introduce that
Esterhazy to my daughter?

1111
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,800
We'll meet later.

1112
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:23,600
Yes, but the Germans are
in Silesia.

1113
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,600
The Ukrainians will join
the Russians.

1114
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,000
They prefer the Tsar.

1115
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,600
l couldn't think of any
other reaction from them.

1116
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,700
Pardon me.

1117
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:45,300
Long live to the Habsburgs,
even it might not be long.

1118
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,500
And to the army of course.

1119
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,000
It is midnight.
All masks are falling!

1120
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:05,100
Alfred, may introduce
our new guest.

1121
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:08,100
- Tenente Velocchio.
- Alfredo Velocchio.

1122
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,900
Redl.

1123
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,200
The most important thing
for me is...

1124
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,100
that you love me...

1125
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:18,300
protect me and trust me.

1126
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:25,500
All my life I've been weak.
l need your help.

1127
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,400
Tell me what to do.

1128
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:33,400
Tell me how to be.
Cynical, maybe?

1129
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,900
Why cynical?

1130
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:40,500
You don't believe in the
whole thing, but you go on.

1131
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,800
You said war is coming,
but you'll lose it anyway.

1132
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,100
Am l supposed
to seize power?

1133
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:51,600
Enough officers
share my views.

1134
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:55,900
Should we support
the Emperor...

1135
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:58,500
who is old
and may be dying?

1136
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:03,700
It's the war we should stop.

1137
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,400
Or...

1138
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:13,700
a bullet from this pistol
might be the solution.

1139
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,800
No, there is a better way.

1140
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,000
- Who sent you?
- Excuse me?

1141
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,300
Who sent you?

1142
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:28,300
The Italians? Russians?
French? English?

1143
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:29,700
Who?

1144
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,400
l don't know who.

1145
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,900
I'm getting 12,000 crowns
for it.

1146
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:37,500
For what?

1147
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,800
I'm supposed to get
military secrets from you.

1148
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:46,600
They're most interested in
the plans to attack Russia.

1149
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,400
Over.

1150
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,300
The code letter for war
with Russia is "R".

1151
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,800
Yes. R.

1152
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:17,400
On the northern front
there are 788 battalions.

1153
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,200
377 cavalry squadrons.

1154
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:25,500
379 batteries
with 2,222 guns.

1155
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,400
69 technical companies.

1156
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:33,400
6 companies of bicyclists,
1,234 machine guns.

1157
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:36,200
Understood?

1158
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,900
In the fortresses Lemberg,
Cracow, Przemysl...

1159
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,600
22 battalions.

1160
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,800
7 cavalry regiments.

1161
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,400
1 battery with 6 guns.

1162
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:53,900
83 artillery regiments.

1163
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,500
And now get lost.

1164
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:36,100
From where did you know
Alfredo Velocchio?

1165
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:40,100
l didn't. l met him
that night in October.

1166
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,900
Who introduced him to you?

1167
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:44,300
- l forgot.
- Think.

1168
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:49,700
Who was it? Who told you
to introduce him to me?

1169
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:52,700
- Excuse me?
- Who commissioned you?

1170
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:56,400
No one. He asked me
to introduce him.

1171
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,700
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

1172
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:01,200
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

1173
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,000
You're lying!

1174
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:09,000
l swear,
he mentioned Christoph.

1175
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,900
Why don't they arrest me?

1176
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:30,000
What are they waiting for?

1177
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,500
They need a Ukrainian.

1178
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,300
Our Father...

1179
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:26,400
who art in Heaven...

1180
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:40,100
Perhaps l should have
tried this earlier.

1181
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:53,000
Thank you.

1182
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:54,000
Salapska. Colonel,
we must speak to you.

1183
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,600
Come in.

1184
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,000
We have orders to disarm
and arrest you.

1185
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:16,300
Which is
Colonel Red's room?

1186
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:18,400
First floor, number 71.

1187
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,700
He has officers visiting
already.

1188
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:41,000
Major Salapska reporting.
This way.

1189
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:27,100
You'll be court-martialled
for passing military secrets.

1190
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:31,500
The court-martial will decide
your fate in an open hearing.

1191
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:34,700
- I've been provoked.
- No, we were!

1192
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:39,800
Since you were in Fiume,
you've been a traitor.

1193
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:43,100
The Archduke chose me
because our friendship...

1194
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:45,600
and your relations
with my sister...

1195
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:47,800
make you part of our family.

1196
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,100
He asked me to deliver his
message to you personally.

1197
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:57,600
Behave properly in court
and admit the charges...

1198
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:00,300
then the sentence
will be light.

1199
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:06,700
Or you'll be sentenced
for treason and betrayal.

1200
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:09,400
Betrayal.

1201
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:13,500
Is a national
virtue nowadays.

1202
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:17,400
I'm sorry we're meeting
again like this.

1203
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,700
lf it's any consolation,
some people know...

1204
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:22,900
and I've told them...

1205
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:28,600
no officer has been
more reliable than you.

1206
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,400
Alfred, l really would like
to have your child.

1207
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,700
Do what you're
expected to...

1208
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:54,200
and nothing will happen
to you.

1209
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:59,500
Haven't you noticed
that no one's on your side?

1210
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:03,400
Nobody but me.

1211
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:06,700
Children?

1212
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:13,200
Now...

1213
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,200
l don't like children
anymore.

1214
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:35,000
They telegraphed me
to come here from Fiume.

1215
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:38,200
May l?

1216
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:44,000
How do they know
we were friends?

1217
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,400
They know everything.

1218
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:50,100
- Did you betray secrets?
- Not the way you heard.

1219
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:54,100
Then stand up in court
and defend yourself.

1220
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:57,900
The court only accepts
evidence that can be proved.

1221
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:01,900
The Emperor would never
allow an unjust verdict.

1222
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:06,000
lf the charge is false,
they can't take the uniform.

1223
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,700
They'll take yours, too,
if it suits them.

1224
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:14,000
They might need
a better scapegoat soon.

1225
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Then it'll be your turn.
The Jews.

1226
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,000
The simplest solution.
Popular, too.

1227
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,400
None of us will be wearing
this uniform much longer.

1228
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:28,700
l converted to Christianity,
you know that.

1229
01:59:29,700 --> 01:59:31,500
And what shall l do?

1230
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,400
My grandfather...

1231
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:36,800
Doctor Ignaz Sonnenschein,
always said...

1232
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:42,700
"Lord, you didn't make me
Moses or an Emperor.

1233
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:46,100
So you can only hold me
accountable...

1234
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:51,900
for being Doctor Ignaz
Sonnenschein all my life".

1235
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:58,100
Tell them what
they want to hear.

1236
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:00,200
It's just
another year or two.

1237
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:03,900
l dreamed about you.

1238
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:09,400
l walked in darkness and
you showed me the way out.

1239
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,800
We should live together.

1240
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:16,200
We're talking about
the head of Intelligence.

1241
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:21,200
He was the head, Captain.
Is that clear?

1242
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:24,600
Yes, sir. But Colonel Redl
was my superior.

1243
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:28,500
Didn't you ever notice
anything about his behaviour?

1244
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:31,100
Yes, Colonel.
His will to work.

1245
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:34,200
He rarely slept or ate,
just kept working.

1246
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:37,100
Gentlemen...

1247
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:40,300
Remain seated. How are
the trial preparations?

1248
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:44,300
He won't cooperate.
I'd have this traitor shot.

1249
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,700
The paper could call it
an accident.

1250
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:50,300
He was run over or fell out
of a hotel window.

1251
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:52,300
Then a military funeral.

1252
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:56,300
I'm not sure yet what's best
for the Monarchy.

1253
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,500
No other aspect matters.

1254
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:03,000
Well, gentlemen.

1255
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:08,000
Solution 1:
an open hearing.

1256
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,700
But Redl won't cooperate.

1257
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:15,000
- Correct?
- Yes, Your Highness.

1258
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Not to mention that Redl
has a lot of information...

1259
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:22,700
which he might disclose
at the trial...

1260
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:25,400
with unpleasant results.

1261
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:27,300
Solution 2:
a closed hearing.

1262
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:30,800
Sentence made public
after execution...

1263
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,100
in such detail that it
alarms the whole army...

1264
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:40,900
and also the whole civilian
population. Do you agree?

1265
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:47,600
Whoever agrees
should raise his hand.

1266
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,300
Lt. Colonel Kubinyi,
you don't agree?

1267
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:02,900
Imperial Highness,
l beg to reply, no.

1268
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:07,900
What do you suggest?

1269
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:12,900
Redl should have the chance
to decide his own fate.

1270
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:15,700
You were his school friend,
hence prejudiced.

1271
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:18,100
Principally, you're right.

1272
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:20,500
How can Redl decide
his own fate?

1273
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:23,600
He won't even agree
to a public trial.

1274
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:26,100
We're speaking of a traitor.

1275
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:29,400
One can only deal with
a traitor when he's dead.

1276
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:32,600
l won't inquire
how this man...

1277
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:36,500
managed to get
into the Ministry.

1278
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:39,900
Who backed him,
or whom he deceived.

1279
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:42,800
These questions will be
answered later.

1280
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:48,900
For the people
of the Monarchy...

1281
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:51,000
we're dealing
with an officer...

1282
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,600
in the Imperial
War Ministry.

1283
02:02:54,600 --> 02:03:00,500
So, l suggest he should be
allowed to end it himself.

1284
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:03,700
And we can publish the
version acceptable to us.

1285
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:06,200
A third solution.

1286
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,600
What is the public told
in this case?

1287
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:13,600
He picked a certified letter,
two detectives saw him...

1288
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:16,500
he was captured
trying to escape...

1289
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:18,200
and committed suicide.

1290
02:03:19,700 --> 02:03:21,000
Yes?

1291
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,500
Your Highness,
in this case...

1292
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:26,600
journalists will insist
on details.

1293
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:29,900
He might have torn
the envelope...

1294
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:33,100
and mislaid the pieces
or left it in a car.

1295
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:36,000
Or his penknife he used
to open the envelope...

1296
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,000
or the penknife case.

1297
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:43,000
Very good. It should be
published like this.

1298
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
l suggest it's not published
like that. It should leak out.

1299
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:48,600
But not in Vienna.

1300
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:51,300
In Lemberg,
Budapest, or Prague.

1301
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:54,000
Let some bright reporter
uncover it.

1302
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,300
We just plant the clues
that lead to Redl.

1303
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:01,200
We should check a list of
all journalists in Prague.

1304
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,600
Any counter-suggestions,
gentlemen?

1305
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:07,400
l also think this is
the best solution.

1306
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:09,600
Lt. Colonel Kubinyi...

1307
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:13,200
your opposition
led to this solution.

1308
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:16,100
You'll visit Redl,
as an old comrade...

1309
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:19,700
and hand him
your service revolver.

1310
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:23,300
Your Highness, l can't
perform this task.

1311
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:27,200
An officer cannot take
action against a superior.

1312
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:39,600
By the grace of the Emperor
and by my own decision...

1313
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:43,200
l promote
Lt. Colonel Kubinyi...

1314
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:46,500
to Colonel of the
Austro-Hungarian Army.

1315
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:51,000
My orders takes effect
immediately.

1316
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,500
Colonel...

1317
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:28,900
you know how to use
the weapon.

1318
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:32,900
You will have a moment,
but please be brief.

1319
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,800
Then there is no trial.

1320
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,900
Is there anyone you wish
to say goodbye to?

1321
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:18,700
Make sure you get
out of here, quickly.

1322
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:48,200
A briefcase and matching
wallet, leather...

1323
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:52,200
with the monogram A.R.
Eighty crowns.

1324
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,600
One bid for eighty.

1325
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:59,400
- Ninety.
- One hundred.

1326
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:01,500
- One hundred...
- A hundred twenty.

1327
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:05,900
One hundred and twenty.
Going once, twice, sold!

1328
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:21,600
Next a child's poem,
handwritten.

1329
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:24,500
"Dedicated to our
Emperor and King.

1330
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:26,600
Like the dew
from Heaven sent...

1331
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:28,800
may on him
be blessings spent.

1332
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,400
May they give the strength
he needs...

1333
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:34,900
for all of his
majestic deeds.

1334
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:38,100
Alfred Redl, elementary
school pupil."
