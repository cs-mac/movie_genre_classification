Miss. Kelty.

00:03:42,800 -> 00:03:44,677 
Miss. Kelty. 

3 
00:04:19,120 -> 00:04:22,430 
You do not need me, Sr. Baring. 
Made me waste any time.

00:04:24,040 -> 00:04:27,237 
Knows where they are and nothing 
Fast dancing 

5 
00:04:29,720 -> 00:04:31,756 
Do you think I should take 
hospital? 

6 
00:04:31,880 -> 00:04:33,552 
No, ma'am. 

7 
00:04:33,680 -> 00:04:38,879 
To those people, and 'better not to approach 
if not they pay you. 

8 
00:04:39,000 -> 00:04:42,675 
Your father 87 years Janet

9 
00:04:42,800 -> 00:04:45,951 
Do not worry I'm not going anywhere 

10 
00:04:46,080 -> 00:04:49,117 
I've searched everywhere, Jerry. 

11 
00:04:49,240 -> 00:04:51,037 
Farewell 
- See 

12 
00:04:51,160 -> 00:04:53,799 
And thanks for the visit of Pope ' 
- Nothing 

13 
00:04:58,960 -> 00:05:03,670 
The discovery has Billy Fisher 
the boy who brings the food. 

14 
00:05:03,800 -> 00:05:06,758 
He lived like a hermit. 

15 
00:05:07,600 -> 00:05:10,273 
He spoke in a strange way, not 
I type ..... 

16 
00:05:12,760 -> 00:05:16,912 
He had half his face paralyzed, try 
you talk with half his mouth. 

17 
00:05:17,040 -> 00:05:21,113 
- So you saw her?

18 
00:05:21,240 -> 00:05:25,791 
- I think are doing well. 
- Of course he lived as he pleased. 

19 
00:05:36,800 -> 00:05:39,553 
Possible that people can 
live so isolated? 

20 
00:05:39,680 -> 00:05:42,797 
People do not. Only Miss Kelty. 

21 
00:05:50,680 -> 00:05:53,148 
God and 'beautiful here. 

22 
00:05:55,280 -> 00:05:59,910 
Look, you and 'put down peaceful 
and crossed her arms and 'dead. 

23 
00:06:00,040 -> 00:06:03,953 
There seems dead 
long time! 

24 
00:06:04,080 -> 00:06:08,358 
No, I would feel if he were already dead 
by more 'than a day. 

25 
00:06:09,160 -> 00:06:12,277 
It 'a thing that I need to take care of it? 

26 
00:06:12,400 -> 00:06:13,992 
No really. 

27 
00:06:14,120 -> 00:06:16,793 
It seems that never left 
their homes for a while. 

28 
00:06:16,920 -> 00:06:21,516 
I think I too, will be a year 
who could not see down in the village. 

29 
00:06:25,960 -> 00:06:28,520 
But how 'possible? 

30 
00:06:28,640 -> 00:06:32,918 
No electricity, no telephone 
no running water. 

31 
00:06:44,040 -> 00:06:46,270 
And lived here all alone and? 

32 
00:06:46,400 -> 00:06:50,712 
Hermits and 'that's what they do, 
live alone and die alone. 

33 
00:06:54,000 -> 00:06:55,479 
Peterson calls Robinsville. 

34 
00:07:01,800 -> 00:07:04,268 
Come, all right, covers. 

35 
00:07:04,400 -> 00:07:06,436 
We return to civilization. 

36 
00:07:10,520 -> 00:07:13,193 
Billy was found when 
brought supplies? 

37 
00:07:13,320 -> 00:07:16,471 
- Sure. 
- Go ahead'll join you. 

38 
00:08:20,200 -> 00:08:22,156 
Come. 

39 
00:08:29,360 -> 00:08:31,555

40 
00:08:38,760 -> 00:08:40,796 
- Turn away. 
"But who the devil and '? 

41 
00:08:42,640 -> 00:08:44,710 
- Turn away. 
"But who the devil and '? 

42 
00:08:44,840 -> 00:08:47,912 
- Put away the gun. 
- Do not touch the gun. 

43 
00:08:48,040 -> 00:08:51,316 
- E 'scared. 
- You are 'scared? 

44 
00:08:53,000 -> 00:08:54,513 
But Christ of God 

45 
00:09:01,240 -> 00:09:05,791 
- Did you know that there was someone else here? 
- No, I never knew. 

46 
00:09:05,920 -> 00:09:08,992 
- Are you all right? 
- Sí. 

47 
00:09:11,080 -> 00:09:14,595 
Then we take a step at a time. 
Stay here, I now went back in. 

48 
00:09:14,720 -> 00:09:17,439 
I can not bring back Jerry does not know 
even who it is 

49 
00:09:17,560 -> 00:09:20,916 
It 'a human being, and' 
terrified 

50 
00:09:21,040 -> 00:09:24,555 
- What would you do? 
- Talking. 

51 
00:09:24,680 -> 00:09:26,636 
If I can. 

52 
00:09:46,920 -> 00:09:48,876 
Please do not be afraid 

53 
00:10:10,760 -> 00:10:16,392 
"The Lord has pruned stranger here 
Take care of my Nell. " 

54 
00:10:16,840 -> 00:10:19,832 
"In the child, the Lord protect you." 

55 
00:10:19,960 -> 00:10:24,397 
Did you see that? The old woman was crazy 
mistress of half the forest. 

56 
00:10:25,080 -> 00:10:28,755 
The first is that the daughter 
should even take care of them? 

57 
00:10:28,880 -> 00:10:31,758 
- What would you then you

59 
00:10:36,320 -> 00:10:39,995 
Do not want the lord

60 
00:10:40,120 -> 00:10:42,509 
The last time I had to 
do with the Lord

It 'been in my marriage, and

What do I inform the service 
Welfare? 

64 
00:10:52,800 -> 00:10:57,590 
Not need a social worker 
here we want the asylum. 

65 
00:10:57,720 -> 00:11:00,473

72 
00:11:37,360 -> 00:11:38,554

And this girl speaks only 
an unknown language?

00:12:13,280 -> 00:12:16,989 
The mother had a facial palsy 
perhaps due to a stroke 

82 
00:12:17,120 -> 00:12:20,430 
It 'possible that the child has assimilated 
its problems of expression 

83 
00:12:20,560 -> 00:12:23,313 
Problems elocution, not

- It 'a beautiful day. 
- What and 'happened to that woman? 

109 
00:15:27,400 -> 00:15:31,188 
For everything and anything 
you happen sometimes 

110 
00:15:31,320 -> 00:15:33,914 
- There are obvious cause? 
- Do you want a list? 

111 
00:15:34,040 -> 00:15:36,110 
The life and 'hard. 

112 
00:15:36,600 -> 00:15:41,390 
E 'luckier than others, if only

E 'ready to face the jungle? 

114 
00:16:23,120 -> 00:16:25,315 
See how you can 'reduce a child Christ. 

115 
00:16:25,440 -> 00:16:27,954 
But does so when 
There 'people. 

116 
00:16:28,080 -> 00:16:31,390 
- Outsiders frightened. 
- But how do you know? 

117 
00:16:31,520 -> 00:16:34,114 
It 'a bit' that I observe. 

118 
00:16:38,380 -> 00:16:41,509 
E ', islands, and' definitely 
retardation 

119 
00:16:41,640 -> 00:16:45,918 
Blood examinations for possible inefficiencies

120 
00:16:46,040 -> 00:16:47,996

Moves. 

126 
00:17:30,080 -> 00:17:32,071 
If you're right and I repeat "if" 

127 
00:17:32,200 -> 00:17:35,431 
if he never left his cabin 
or rather that part of the forest, 

128 
00:17:35,560 -> 00:17:39,712 
if he only knew his mother, if 
never had contact with the outside world 

129 
00:17:39,840 -> 00:17:43,276 
Never seen a car a TV 
a weapon a carton of chocolate 

130 
00:17:43,400 -> 00:17:45,470 
never heard of rock ... 

131 
00:17:45,600 -> 00:17:49,354 
- How does he tell me who can speak. 
- Yes but it 'a kind of language of its creation. 

132 
00:17:49,480 -> 00:17:53,314 
Are not real wild child 
more than 60 years 

133 
00:17:53,440 -> 00:17:54,839 
Not 'a wild child. 

134 
00:17:54,960 -> 00:17:58,316 
- It 'only a brief period. 
- It is not 'even a child. 

135 
00:17:58,440 -> 00:18:01,398 
And that makes her a unique case. 

136 
00:18:01,520 -> 00:18:03,476 
This is not 'his field know, however, 

137

How does a personality? 
Do not know. 

139

Because there is' innate? and how to acquire? 
do not know. 

140 
00:18:13,200 -> 00:18:15,509 
Arises as the difference 
sex? do not know 

141 
00:18:15,640 -> 00:18:19,633 
You can not take a child and do 
grow in the laboratory, by monitoring 
and controlling it .... 

142 
00:18:19,760 -> 00:18:22,035 
Wants to grow in the surgery? 

143 
00:18:22,160 -> 00:18:24,958 
Develop in the laboratory? No. 

144 
00:18:25,080 -> 00:18:29,710 
At Dr. Lovell believes that thou 
make a Frankenstein experiment. 

145 
00:18:31,520 -> 00:18:35,718 
Allow me a question, Dr Lovell: 
Could survive alone? 

146 
00:18:39,960 -> 00:18:42,758 
- I do not know. 
- Then we say that it might not. 

147 
00:18:42,880 -> 00:18:45,792 
Person in charge? you?

Who Volunteers? 

150 
00:18:49,600 -> 00:18:53,718 
I can say only this, they will be 
someone with an ulterior motive 

151 
00:18:53,840 -> 00:18:57,469 
Anyone in the world to take care of the next 
always has an ulterior motive 

152 
00:18:57,600 -> 00:19:02,151 
Mother Teresa of Calcutta she wants 
its existence has been helpful to others. 

153 
00:19:02,280 -> 00:19:05,955 
Just like me. Excuse me. 

154 
00:19:26,640 -> 00:19:28,631 
CHILD GAZZELLE 

155 
00:19:28,760 -> 00:19:30,716 
A CHILD JUST ONE .....

No it does not matter I had to get up

I've got a court order

What do you mean?

- Can you give me a little 'time? 
- I can not handle it right after lunch.

I am sorry, Jerry.

We came to take charge.

Tell him, Don. 

178 
00:22:10,600 -> 00:22:16,357 
I've got a court order that says 
if that does not have the consent of Nell, 
she violates his rights 

179 
00:22:16,480 -> 00:22:21,110 
And if she does so I dragged 
the Supreme Court. 

180 
00:22:25,160 -> 00:22:29,472 
Not 'able to give his consent? 

181 
00:22:29,600 -> 00:22:31,670 
Not even speak our language. 

182 
00:22:31,800 -> 00:22:36,078 
If you do not speak our language from him 
through an interpreter. 

183 
00:22:36,200 -> 00:22:38,839 
And what interpreter? and 'madness

There 'no one in the world 
speaks the language

00:22:42,600 -> 00:22:45,876 
Then I'll have 
someone learns 

186 
00:23:01,640 -> 00:23:05,076 
According to Dr. Lovell his natural habitat 
and 'a shed ... 

187 
00:23:05,200 -> 00:23:07,839 
in the heart of the forest 

188 
00:23:07,960 -> 00:23:10,269 
I take a different view 

189 
00:23:10,400 -> 00:23:13,915 
I see a victim of abuse 
and ignorance 

190 
00:23:14,040 -> 00:23:18,477 
I see a woman deprived of 
half of his life 

191 
00:23:18,600 -> 00:23:22,559 
His mother has never met 
and Dr. Lovell is not doing the same? 

192 
00:23:22,680 -> 00:23:25,114 
Hides in the forest as a 
pet owned?

cited by some academic relations, 

196 
00:23:33,920 -> 00:23:37,196 
and eventually the rest of 
life in an institution, 

197 
00:23:37,320 -> 00:23:42,553 
abandoned by those same doctors 
who claimed to assist 

198 
00:23:42,680 -> 00:23:47,993 
Has a house in a life 
not asking for help to anyone 

199 
00:23:48,120 -> 00:23:52,636 
Be sure that needs it 
before the help stifle the 

200 
00:23:52,760 -> 00:23:55,752 
If you must get out of that shack 
will need to know that at the moment ... 

201 
00:23:55,880 -> 00:23:59,555 
- Who knows if it will agree to leave the cabin? 
- And that is' the best life we can give her? 

202 
00:23:59,680 -> 00:24:03,992 
- Who are we God for giving life to someone 
- We must help each other, not there 'nothing 
obliges us .... 

203 
00:24:04,120 -> 00:24:06,953 
Okay so I just realized 
situation 

204 
00:24:07,080 -> 00:24:11,312 
So I do this, I refer the 
My decision to three months 

205 
00:24:11,440 -> 00:24:14,955 
and then you allow a period of 
Observation and Assessment 

206 
00:24:15,640 -> 00:24:19,952 
I hope that at the end the court will have 
better information 

207 
00:24:49,800 -> 00:24:52,519 
Will to survive 
this life lasts? 

208 
00:24:54,000 -> 00:24:59,074 
Here I see air conditioners 
can breathe air is not treated? 

209 
00:25:03,720 -> 00:25:08,271 
Ohhh. Who pays for this building 
float? 

210 
00:25:08,400 -> 00:25:11,039 
My department, the 
program and 'best interests of 

211 
00:25:11,160 -> 00:25:13,116 
Course I believe you 

212

And as you hold? 

213 
00:25:17,600 -> 00:25:19,238 
Three months. 

214 
00:25:21,080 -> 00:25:25,392 
- But he has a life of her? 
- Do not have time. 

215 
00:25:26,960 -> 00:25:29,633 
And what is she staying? 

216 
00:25:29,760 -> 00:25:33,070 
- I do not know. 
- And his patient how they fare? 

217 
00:25:33,200 -> 00:25:37,432 
I quickly found a replacement 
none and 'essential 

218 
00:25:37,560 -> 00:25:41,109 
I bet you want to get to 
Professor climbing up here? 

219 
00:25:41,240 -> 00:25:43,196 
Sure why not? 

220 
00:25:49,720 -> 00:25:52,029 
I feel I have to find a job 

221 
00:25:52,160 -> 00:25:54,993 
And all to help me 
find it for me and 'welcome

223 
00:25:57,120 -> 00:26:01,238 
I would be grateful if you do not send 
everything whores

What's this'? 

225 
00:29:09,160 -> 00:29:12,914 
- What do you think that '? 
- We never talked about cameras. 

226 
00:29:13,040 -> 00:29:17,079 
- And 'the least intrusive method of observation. 
- How did you mount it? 

227 
00:29:17,200 -> 00:29:20,317 
The girl was sleeping, 
sleeps most of the day 

228 
00:29:24,640 -> 00:29:26,437 
It allows me to dress? 

229 
00:30:03,320 -> 00:30:04,753 
I'm Jerry. 

230 
00:30:17,080 -> 00:30:19,150 
You are Nell. I am Jerry. 

231 
00:31:58,840 -> 00:32:01,274 
"MI". You understand. Jerry. 

232 
00:32:03,640 -> 00:32:05,312 
You, Nell. 

233 
00:32:09,360 -> 00:32:11,715 
Perfect.

Has developed an ego objective 
and a subjective ego ... 

236 
00:32:58,080 -> 00:33:00,389 
But I have never seen un'estromissione 
so perfect. 

237 
00:33:00,520 -> 00:33:04,433 
That 'and' "may" - I - in the mirror. 
Thinks it's the opposite 

238 
00:33:04,560 -> 00:33:08,712 
but that's' "me" in the mirror 
like if you see from the outside. 

239 
00:33:08,840 -> 00:33:10,717 
Has done some analysis? 

240 
00:33:10,840 -> 00:33:13,149 
Only the blood. Normal. 

241 
00:33:13,280 -> 00:33:16,556 
We should evaluate its ability 
intellectual before the hearing but ... 

242 
00:33:16,680 -> 00:33:19,592 
I find that it is too early 

243 
00:33:19,720 -> 00:33:23,998 
- I want you to hear the language they speak. 
- The gesture means what? 

244 
00:33:24,120 -> 00:33:26,839 
I do not know and 'a kind of self encouragement 

245 
00:33:26,960 -> 00:33:29,155 
He did this when he said "may". 

246 
00:33:29,280 -> 00:33:32,750 
Should explain that the language 
degraded and 'misleading. 

247 
00:33:32,880 -> 00:33:39,718 
Indeed. The mother had aphasia, 
but the verb forms are aberrant ... 

248 
00:33:39,840 -> 00:33:42,195 
Judge for yourself. 

249 
00:33:53,440 -> 00:33:54,634 
Incredible. 

250 
00:34:09,760 -> 00:34:11,159 
Nell. 

251 
00:34:29,400 -> 00:34:31,630 
Do you mind if I speak? 

252 
00:34:35,040 -> 00:34:39,795 
I like it here, and 'calm. 

253 
00:34:41,640 -> 00:34:44,473 
You're right, Nell. 

254 
00:34:45,040 -> 00:34:47,759 
If you live with people coming problems. 

255 
00:34:47,880 -> 00:34:52,396 
Before you fuck life 
and then you let go right? 

256 
00:34:57,080 -> 00:34:59,116 
Do not you ever feel alone, Nell? 

257 
00:35:04,800 -> 00:35:07,951 
Even I had 
brothers or sisters. 

258 
00:35:08,080 -> 00:35:10,833 
Very unusual for an Irish family, 
Dr. Lovell. 

259 
00:35:10,960 -> 00:35:12,996 
A and 'real' that way. 

260 
00:35:13,120 -> 00:35:17,079 
The family next door, the Connor, 

261 
00:35:17,200 -> 00:35:20,590 
They had 7 children 7. 

262 
00:35:21,240 -> 00:35:24,516 
Shouting and screaming, and 
enjoyed a world 

263 
00:35:24,640 -> 00:35:28,474 
I'm looking at the hedge 
the window 

264 
00:35:29,640 -> 00:35:34,509 
I hear music, and 'a band. 
A parade that marches through the street 

265 
00:35:35,520 -> 00:35:41,072 
I am the door I grabbed Jamie Connor 
and drags me down the street. 

266 
00:35:41,200 -> 00:35:43,031 
And my heart goes bang bang ... 

267 
00:35:43,160 -> 00:35:45,116 
The band is ....... 

268 
00:35:47,240 -> 00:35:49,549 
As I was excited. 

269 
00:35:49,680 -> 00:35:51,910 
Jamie takes me to 
hand and began to walk. 

270 
00:35:52,040 -> 00:35:55,077 
Another takes my other hand. 
The band behind us 

271 
00:36:01,720 -> 00:36:04,712 
if I had heard a band I 
understand. 

272 
00:36:04,840 -> 00:36:08,230 
and marched me and the other children 
I was no longer 'only 

273 
00:36:08,360 -> 00:36:10,555 
you know what I'm saying? 

274 
00:36:10,680 -> 00:36:13,035 
We were not just talking about .... 

275 
00:36:13,160 -> 00:36:17,517 
only the pleasure of being together 

276 
00:37:00,320 -> 00:37:02,117 
Idu? 

277 
00:37:10,240 -> 00:37:14,119 
Je'y b'en anjaga'da, ito? 

278 
00:37:17,240 -> 00:37:19,708 
Anjaga'da. 

279 
00:37:40,200 -> 00:37:42,555 
- Did you see? 
- Has seen right. 

280 
00:37:42,680 -> 00:37:46,116 
He spoke with me, he holds out his hand 

281 
00:37:46,240 -> 00:37:52,236 
I did not ask, and 'was her 
"Je'y b'en anjaga'da. 

282 
00:37:52,360 -> 00:37:56,353 
You know that means? - No 
- Ok then I'll tell 'you something. 

283 
00:37:56,480 -> 00:38:00,268 
- Nell speaks our language. 
- She says, or we go. 

284 
00:38:00,400 -> 00:38:06,509 
Almost always, here is here: 
"De'pe yo goes v'ene anjaga'da. 

285 
00:38:06,640 -> 00:38:08,358 
Is there a word in whether this 
sentence. 

286 
00:38:08,480 -> 00:38:11,517 
Let's play linguistics 
experimental. 

287 
00:38:11,640 -> 00:38:14,712 
"Ha'ba" speaks. "De'pe" later. 
Lack of consonants. 

288 
00:38:14,840 -> 00:38:17,718 
But what does "chickabee? 

289 
00:38:17,840 -> 00:38:20,752 
She says "spike chickabee. 
What is' "spike"? 

290 
00:38:21,680 -> 00:38:23,079 
I do not know? 

291 
00:38:23,200 -> 00:38:26,192 
When he says fear 
"nanny" that means? 

292 
00:38:26,880 -> 00:38:28,836 
Not sure yet 

293 
00:38:30,840 -> 00:38:32,319 
Where is' gone? 

294 
00:39:25,000 -> 00:39:27,150 
O my God! 

295 
00:39:33,080 -> 00:39:35,833 
- It's not looking so good. 
- Why not? 

296 
00:39:35,960 -> 00:39:41,512 
- Why and 'naked. 
- So what? I find it beautiful 

297 
00:39:45,280 -> 00:39:49,319 
Do you think want to abuse 
doctor-patient relationship? 

298 
00:39:49,920 -> 00:39:51,672 
- Would you do it? 
- No. 

299 
00:39:52,720 -> 00:39:56,679 
The fact that you'll discover not mean 
who wants to go to bed. 

300 
00:39:56,800 -> 00:39:58,870 
I'm fine too, but ... 

301 
00:39:59,960 -> 00:40:02,872 
- Thanks 
- He understood very well 

302 
00:40:03,000 -> 00:40:04,115 
Forget 

303 
00:40:04,240 -> 00:40:08,631 
- No, I feel ... 
- It's not 'the case are cresciutella. 

304 
00:40:18,520 -> 00:40:21,159 
because it affects so much to Nell? 

305 
00:40:26,280 -> 00:40:30,876 
And 'as if it were alone in the world 

306 
00:40:34,680 -> 00:40:38,673 
As if he needed 
nobody 

307 
00:40:45,120 -> 00:40:50,592 
You can live like a lifetime 
not become crazy at the end? 

308 
00:41:51,520 -> 00:41:54,239 
I do not understand you, Nell. WHAT ' "spike"? 

309

326 
00:45:04,560 -> 00:45:08,348 
- It's called silly

347 
00:48:36,840 -> 00:48:40,594 
If your only encounter with a man

348 
00:48:40,720 -> 00:48:44,759 
She would tell her daughter that the men

- Market.

Perhaps what prevents her from leaving 
the light of day and 'phobia

356 
00:49:05,960 -> 00:49:08,190 
Because the risk of rape and ' 
more days? 

357 
00:49:08,320 -> 00:49:10,675 
Not rape, to be 
seen by someone during the day.

Nell has his own special way 
doing things 

427 
00:59:39,080 -> 00:59:42,993 
could also succeed 
to fend for itself at the bottom

So let's write together 
look at its future Paula.

the story of the wild girl 

431 
00:59:55,120 -> 00:59:57,156 
and it will attract reporters here

"His name is Nell?" 

457 
01:02:58,280 -> 01:03:01,511 
But why not leave her in peace and 
live like the devil do you think? 

458

No. 

561 
01:16:48,840 -> 01:16:53,277 
According to research children who see 
their parents have a good life

What 'wrong? 

568 
01:17:18,480 -> 01:17:23,793 
My father went away I had 13 years 
My mother does not know why 

569 
01:17:23,920 -> 01:17:27,549 
She was always cheerful and smiling 

570 
01:17:27,680 -> 01:17:31,593 
It seemed that we were all happy 

571 
01:17:32,640 -> 01:17:36,872 
He liked people happy, and she 
appear to be happy

01:17:37,920 -> 01:17:41,674 
e. ....... 

573 
01:17:43,360 -> 01:17:46,158 
Do you know what 'I did not go down? 

574 
01:17:46,280 -> 01:17:48,350 
we are all ... 

575 
01:17:50,200 -> 01:17:53,431 
slaves of these patterns that 
run in the same way 

576 
01:18:05,360 -> 01:18:08,955 
You do not give the impression of repeating 
always the same patterns 

577 
01:18:09,080 -> 01:18:10,798 
Or some 

578 
01:18:10,920 -> 01:18:16,358 
I do run them in reverse? 
I do not go to suffer ever so ... 

579 
01:18:17,400 -> 01:18:22,030 
Do not remove the brake to the feelings 
even when I would gladly 

580 
01:18:48,520 -> 01:18:50,272 
Nell and 'something happened?

Something happened?

01:19:20,600 -> 01:19:22,830 
I'm not crying 

583 
01:19:41,960 -> 01:19:44,076 
No, devil take me? 

584 
01:20:33,920 -> 01:20:36,514

587 
01:21:11,320 -> 01:21:14,073 
In the wild girl 
found in the woods 

588 
01:21:14,880 -> 01:21:18,953

"The wild has never spent a dollar 
yet in his life is worth millions. " 

591 
01:21:25,280 -> 01:21:27,510 
But where to take 
this crap? 

592 
01:21:28,520 -> 01:21:30,954 
We have to take it away 

593 
01:21:36,320 -> 01:21:38,276 
Hospital? 

594 
01:21:39,520 -> 01:21:42,990 
And 'the only place must not 
may harm 

595 
01:22:43,120 -> 01:22:45,554 
To hell with you and 
Your cameras 

596 
01:22:49,280 -> 01:22:51,316

Nell and 'about to begin 
a perilous voyage. 

669 
01:35:31,040 -> 01:35:33,110 
We can drive 
that journey 

670 
01:35:33,240 -> 01:35:36,073 
But we can not turn back 
clock 

671 
01:35:36,200 -> 01:35:38,156 
Can not return 
to be a girl 

672 
01:35:39,120 -> 01:35:43,910 
But we are not here to choose from 
new life or an ancient life

To me in these 3 months, no 
made progress 

680 
01:36:06,720 -> 01:36:09,075 
Your lawyer will have the opportunity to question 
Professor ...

She and Dr. Olsen have established 
an emotional relationship with the patient 

686 
01:36:23,520 -> 01:36:25,590 
Not 'my patient, 
Nell is not 'sick

During the crisis comes to slamming 
head against the wall 

688 
01:36:28,360 -> 01:36:31,477 
- It was a wall of glass she has not seen

Presents various symptoms of 
Asperger syndrome ...

Was scared 

696 
01:37:33,880 -> 01:37:36,872 
Everyone always afraid 

697 
01:37:37,000 -> 01:37:41,198 
The good God wipes tears 
so many tears 

698 
01:37:49,840 -> 01:37:55,551 
In this world there is' so people in

He knew little things 

709 
01:39:10,280 -> 01:39:14,319 
I love people

I know that everybody goes 

711

You're right

No fear for Nell.

Not weep for Nell.

736 
01:42:26,960 -> 01:42:29,838 
and the baby crying on the sidewalk Harris 
at the gate ... 

737 
01:42:49,880 -> 01:42:51,552 
Good.
