1
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:57,511
Fucking God!

2
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:05,507
- A phone token, please.
- No tokens. At the end, on the left.

3
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:57,954
Maman? Yes, it's Jeanne.

4
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:01,548
I've found a flat to rent in Passy.
I'm going to see it.

5
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:05,148
Then I've got to go to the station
to meet Tom. I promised him.

6
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,590
OK, see you later. Bye!

7
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:14,891
I've come to see the flat. I saw the sign.

8
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:17,775
- The sign?
- Yes.

9
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:21,417
It's always the same!
Nobody ever tells me anything.

10
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:23,897
- I'd like to see it.
- You want to rent it?

11
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:27,139
- I don't know yet!
- They rent, they leave

12
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,492
and I'm the last to know.

13
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,375
Do you think that's right?

14
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,378
If you want to go up alone,

15
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,857
go on. I'm afraid of spiders.

16
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,898
The key is missing.

17
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:43,978
Strange things happen.

18
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,133
They drink six bottles a day.

19
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:57,779
Wait! Don't go! There must be a duplicate.

20
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:06,974
Here it is.

21
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:09,058
You must be very young.

22
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,178
Let go of me!

23
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:22,138
She's crazy!

24
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,718
Who are you?

25
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:21,475
You gave me a fright.
How did you get in?

26
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:26,917
- Through the door.
- Oh, yes. I left it open.

27
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,998
I didn't hear you come in.

28
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:32,837
- I was already here.
- Sorry?

29
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:37,078
Oh, it was you who took it.

30
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:39,553
I had to bribe the concierge.

31
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:46,676
These old houses are fascinating.

32
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:55,639
An armchair by the fireplace
would look good.

33
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,238
The armchair should go

34
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:02,878
in front of the window.

35
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,958
Are you American?

36
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:09,752
You've got an American accent.

37
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:06,112
- Are you going to take it?
- Are you?

38
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,398
I don't know.

39
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,638
What are you doing?

40
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:47,638
Oh là là!

41
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:26,918
Do I answer it or not?

42
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:29,638
Oh!

43
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:32,557
Hello? Hello?

44
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:34,593
Hello.

45
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,440
Hello!

46
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,518
There's no-one here.

47
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:40,598
There's no-one!

48
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,558
I don't know.

49
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:29,235
So you're going to take it?
You've decided?

50
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:35,512
I had already decided.

51
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,878
But I'm not sure now.

52
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:43,678
Do you like it?

53
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:46,038
Do you like it?!

54
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:48,835
I don't know.
I shall have to think about it.

55
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:58,118
Think fast.

56
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,198
I thought you'd left.

57
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,783
Aah... Oh, God.

58
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,464
Oh, Jesus... Oh...

59
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,666
Oh, Christ.

60
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,426
Oh, God.

61
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:36,529
- Watch out!
- Have they taken us for someone else?

62
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:38,694
We're in a film. We're in a film.

63
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:40,774
If I kiss you,

64
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:42,297
it might be cinema.

65
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,374
If I stroke your hair,

66
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,170
it might be cinema.

67
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,732
What's going on? Do you know them?

68
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,930
It's a long story.
In short, Portrait of a Girl.

69
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:56,017
It's been accepted for television!
And the girl is you. It's you!

70
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:58,652
You're mad!
You might have asked me first.

71
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,008
Yeah, but I wanted...

72
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:04,767
I wanted to start with shots of Jeanne
at the station meeting her fiancé.

73
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:06,854
Yes, I know them. They're my crew.

74
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:08,934
So you kissed me,

75
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:11,014
and you knew it was being filmed.

76
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:14,138
You're a bastard! Traitor!

77
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:16,852
No, you'll see. It will be a love story.

78
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:22,813
Tell me, Jeanne, darling.
What did you do while I was away?

79
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:25,930
I thought of you day and night,
and I cried.

80
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:28,253
Darling, I can't live without you!

81
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:30,812
Wonderful! Cut! That was perfect!

82
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:41,847
I'd have finished by now,

83
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:44,568
but the police
wouldn't let me touch anything.

84
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:48,733
They didn't believe it was suicide.
There was so much blood everywhere.

85
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:54,367
They had fun
making me do a reconstruction.

86
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,730
"She went there."

87
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:08,370
"She came through here."

88
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:14,010
"She opened the curtain."

89
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:16,364
I copied all her actions.

90
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:18,724
The guests were awake all night!

91
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:21,729
The hotel was crawling with cops!

92
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:25,008
They enjoy playing around with blood.

93
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:38,250
They were all spies!

94
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,807
Asking if she was sad, if she was happy,

95
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,845
if you fought,

96
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:48,365
how long you'd been married,
why you didn't have any children.

97
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:51,570
Pigs!

98
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:56,284
They got familiar right away!

99
00:19:56,574 --> 00:20:00,010
They said, "Your boss is a bit unstable."

100
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:04,850
"Do you know that he was a boxer?"

101
00:20:04,974 --> 00:20:06,930
So?

102
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:10,770
"lt didn't work out,

103
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:13,565
so he became

104
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:16,128
an actor."

105
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:19,490
"Bongo player,

106
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:27,291
revolutionary in South America,

107
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:29,370
journalist in Japan."

108
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:32,364
"One day, he lands in Tahiti,

109
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:35,250
hangs around,

110
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:37,930
Learns French."

111
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:42,169
"Then he comes to Paris. There...

112
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:50,173
he meets a woman with money,
marries her and..."

113
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:53,730
"Since then what has your boss done?"

114
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:55,810
"Nothing."

115
00:20:57,774 --> 00:21:01,164
I say, "Can I clean up now?"

116
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:05,049
"No! Don't touch anything!"

117
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:08,652
"Do you really think she killed herself?"

118
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:13,052
He pushed me into a corner
and tried to paw me...

119
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:16,805
Turn the tap off now.

120
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:19,687
They'll be doing the autopsy right now.

121
00:21:23,454 --> 00:21:25,524
Why won't you turn the tap off?

122
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:28,327
They told me to give you your razor back.

123
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:33,812
It's not mine.

124
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:37,643
They said they don't need it any more.
The investigation is over.

125
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:41,405
Yes, she had cuts there...

126
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,490
and on the neck, too...

127
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,876
Excuse me,
where shall I put this?

128
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,677
- You could have rung the bell.
- The door was open. I'll put it there.

129
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:05,518
In front of the fireplace.

130
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:10,038
- Careful, madame.
- There.

131
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:18,718
- What about the table?
- How do I know? He'll decide.

132
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,397
- This is a king-size!
- It won't fit.

133
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:30,391
Well, your husband has no idea.
All this in an hour... It's not long.

134
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,078
What a mess!

135
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:40,234
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

136
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:51,400
The armchair goes in front of the window.

137
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:53,319
Like that.

138
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:55,797
But I only came to return the key.

139
00:23:55,922 --> 00:23:58,516
- To return it to you.
- I don't care about the key.

140
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,598
Take your coat off.

141
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:04,312
Take your coat off and help me.

142
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:07,158
OK.

143
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,632
Get those chairs and bring them here.

144
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:17,278
Put them on the other side.

145
00:24:18,562 --> 00:24:20,518
Take that, too.

146
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:22,838
That's it.

147
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,878
You didn't waste any time.

148
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:34,033
Listen, monsieur!

149
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:35,914
I've got to go.

150
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,998
Look, sir! I've got to go.

151
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,265
The bed is too big for the room.

152
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,146
I don't know what to call you.

153
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,226
I don't have a name.

154
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,705
- Do you want to know mine?
- No, no! I don't.

155
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,786
I don't want to know your name.

156
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,347
You don't have a name and I don't
have a name either. Not one name.

157
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,222
You're crazy!

158
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,581
Maybe I am, but I don't want
to know anything about you.

159
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,588
I don't wanna know where you live
or where you come from.

160
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,462
I wanna know nothing.

161
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,546
- You scare me.
- Nothing.

162
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,786
You and I are gonna meet here

163
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,789
without knowing anything
that goes on outside here.

164
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,226
OK?

165
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,306
But why?

166
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,387
Because...

167
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,388
Because we don't need names here.

168
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,186
Don't you see?

169
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,386
We're gonna forget...

170
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,070
everything that we knew. Every...

171
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,547
All the people,... all that we do,...
wherever we live.

172
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,666
We're going to forget that,
everything, everything.

173
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,626
But I can't.

174
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,186
Can you?

175
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,506
I don't know.

176
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,506
Are you scared?

177
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,586
No.

178
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,706
Come.

179
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:51,358
- I thought you'd be here.
- I expected you later.

180
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,038
I took the first train.

181
00:27:00,882 --> 00:27:03,476
Oh, Paul! How awful! How awful, Paul!

182
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:28,756
Papa is in bed with asthma.

183
00:27:32,562 --> 00:27:35,156
The doctor wouldn't let him come.

184
00:27:35,282 --> 00:27:37,671
It's better like that.

185
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:40,032
I'm stronger.

186
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:02,511
What are you looking for?

187
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,951
Something that would explain...

188
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:07,078
- A letter, a clue.
- Nothing.

189
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:12,839
I told you, there's nothing, nothing at all.

190
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:21,392
My little Rosa wouldn't have...

191
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:24,480
Nothing for her mother. Not a word.

192
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,832
It's useless to keep on searching.

193
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:31,478
Not even for you, her husband!

194
00:28:39,882 --> 00:28:41,838
You need to rest.

195
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:46,516
I think room 12 is free.

196
00:29:13,682 --> 00:29:15,638
With a razor?

197
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:23,238
What time did it happen?

198
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:28,195
I don't know. In the evening.

199
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:32,639
And then?

200
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:37,517
Then l...
I already told you on the phone...

201
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:39,878
When I found her,

202
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,038
I called the ambulance.

203
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:48,877
After you called,

204
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:51,914
Papa and I stayed up all night,

205
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,351
talking about Rosa and you.

206
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:57,038
Papa kept whispering,

207
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:01,156
as if it had happened in our house.

208
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:02,797
Paul!

209
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:18,915
- Where did it happen?
- In one of the rooms.

210
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,760
Did she suffer?

211
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:23,680
Ask the doctors.
They're doing the autopsy.

212
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:25,758
The autopsy.

213
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,315
I already had some announcement cards.

214
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,558
I've seen a lot of death.

215
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:03,038
I think of everything.

216
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:08,681
I'll prepare her
a beautiful room with flowers.

217
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:13,998
The cards,

218
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,472
clothes, relatives, flowers.

219
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:20,955
You've got everything in that suitcase.

220
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:23,353
You didn't forget anything.

221
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,918
But I don't want any priests here.

222
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,919
- But...
- No priests.

223
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,998
- But, Paul...
- Understand?

224
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:34,634
- We have to. Funerals must be religious.
- No!

225
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:37,438
Rosa didn't believe.

226
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,679
Nobody believes in
the fucking God here!

227
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:45,150
Paul, don't shout.
Don't talk like that.

228
00:31:48,202 --> 00:31:50,636
The priest doesn't want any suicides.

229
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:53,720
The Church doesn't want any suicides,
do they?

230
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:56,754
They'll give her absolution.

231
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,875
Absolution and a nice mass.
That's all I ask, Paul.

232
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,438
Rosa...
Rosa is my little girl, do you understand?

233
00:32:04,562 --> 00:32:07,952
Rosa... Why did she kill herself?

234
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:12,597
Why? Why did she commit suicide?

235
00:32:15,282 --> 00:32:17,238
Why?

236
00:32:26,762 --> 00:32:28,718
You don't know?

237
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:31,638
You don't know.

238
00:34:09,822 --> 00:34:11,778
Ah...

239
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:15,180
Now...

240
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:18,055
Let's... Let's just look at each other.

241
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:30,575
It's beautiful without knowing anything.

242
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:47,298
Maybe...

243
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:50,496
Maybe we can come without touching.

244
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:54,498
Come without touching?

245
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,698
OK.

246
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:04,296
Are you concentrating?

247
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:06,652
- Did you come yet?
- No.

248
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:09,742
- It's difficult!
- I didn't either yet.

249
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:13,212
You're not trying hard enough.

250
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:22,456
I shall have to invent a name for you.

251
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:25,779
A name? Oh, Jesus Christ!

252
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:31,381
Oh, God, I've been called
by a million names all my life.

253
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:36,212
I don't want a name. I'm better off
with a grunt or a groan for a name.

254
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,058
Do you wanna hear my name?

255
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,018
- It's so masculine.
- Yeah.

256
00:35:47,142 --> 00:35:49,098
Listen to mine.

257
00:35:54,942 --> 00:35:56,694
I didn't get the last name.

258
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:44,893
You shouldn't have done that to me.

259
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:48,534
It's not a wig, it's my hair.

260
00:36:55,978 --> 00:36:59,288
Doesn't it suit me?
Tell me, don't you like it? Tell me.

261
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,329
Of course I like it.

262
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,813
Listen, you know...

263
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:06,494
I don't know.

264
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:09,411
You have changed, and yet you haven't.

265
00:37:09,898 --> 00:37:11,854
I can see the shot now.

266
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:14,334
The camera is up high.

267
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:17,178
It descends slowly and follows you.

268
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:19,812
You come forward,
and it moves in on you.

269
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:22,374
There's music, too.

270
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:27,248
It gets closer and closer to you.

271
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:30,254
I'm in a hurry. Let's start.

272
00:37:31,658 --> 00:37:33,614
But...

273
00:37:33,938 --> 00:37:36,088
..can't we talk a little first?

274
00:37:36,978 --> 00:37:38,934
Tonight we improvise.

275
00:37:39,138 --> 00:37:41,094
You follow.

276
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:54,734
He was my childhood friend.

277
00:37:55,258 --> 00:37:58,933
He used to watch me for hours and hours.
I think he understood me.

278
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:02,607
Dogs are worth more than people.
Much more.

279
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:06,094
Meet Olympia, my nanny.

280
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:09,255
Mustapha could always tell
the poor from the rich.

281
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:13,212
If someone well-dressed came in,
he never stirred.

282
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:17,297
But if someone scruffy came in,
you should have seen him! What a dog!

283
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:20,490
The colonel trained him
to recognise Arabs by their scent.

284
00:38:20,618 --> 00:38:23,974
- Olympia, open the front door.
- Give me a kiss.

285
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,930
Go and open it.

286
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:30,492
Olympia is a compendium
of domestic virtues.

287
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:32,848
Faithful, admiring, and racist.

288
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:40,009
After Papa died, we moved back
to the family home for a while.

289
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:42,368
My childhood was made up of smells.

290
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:45,137
Musty smells,
the smell of walls and rooms.

291
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:49,217
Children used to come and play
in my jungle, all day long.

292
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,653
Growing old is a crime.

293
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:54,734
That's me there.

294
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:58,376
And that's Mademoiselle Sauvage,
the teacher.

295
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,807
She was very strict... and very religious.

296
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,168
She was too good. She spoilt you.

297
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:05,974
That's Christine,

298
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:08,054
my best friend.

299
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:10,772
She married the pharmacist
and has two children.

300
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:13,287
It's like a village here.
We all know each other.

301
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:15,374
I couldn't live in Paris.

302
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,854
We're safe here.

303
00:39:18,978 --> 00:39:21,776
- It's odd looking at the past.
- Cut!

304
00:39:21,898 --> 00:39:25,334
Why is it odd? It's you!
It's fantastic, it's your childhood.

305
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:27,733
It's everything I was looking for.

306
00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:30,691
What are you up to? Move it! Move it!

307
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:34,333
Who are these zombies who are
always following you around? Scoot!

308
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,018
Go on! The door, the door...

309
00:39:37,138 --> 00:39:39,094
I'm opening the door.

310
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:41,534
I'm opening all the doors.

311
00:39:41,658 --> 00:39:44,616
- What are you doing?
- Setting up my shot.

312
00:39:44,738 --> 00:39:47,332
There it is! That's it! I've found it.

313
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:50,174
Reverse gear!

314
00:39:50,298 --> 00:39:52,687
What are you doing there?

315
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:54,456
Beat it!

316
00:39:54,578 --> 00:39:57,775
That's it. Into reverse. Yes!

317
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:02,608
Do you see?
Like a car, you go into reverse gear.

318
00:40:03,378 --> 00:40:05,573
That's it. Close your eyes.

319
00:40:05,698 --> 00:40:08,496
Start reversing. Close your eyes.

320
00:40:09,018 --> 00:40:12,249
That's it, come on.
Come on backwards.

321
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,497
That's it.
Go back to your childhood.

322
00:40:15,618 --> 00:40:17,768
- Papa?
- You're soaring.

323
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:22,130
- Take off and return to your childhood.
- In full uniform.

324
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:24,726
Don't be afraid. Overcome the obstacles.

325
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:26,814
Papa in Algeria.

326
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,210
You're 15.

327
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:31,294
14,

328
00:40:31,418 --> 00:40:33,488
13,... 12,

329
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:36,610
11,... 10,... 9.

330
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:41,092
- We're there.
- My favourite route when I was eight.

331
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:49,014
My old notebook.

332
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:54,775
French homework.
Theme: the countryside.

333
00:40:54,898 --> 00:40:58,095
Exposition:
the countryside is cow country.

334
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:00,573
The cow is all dressed in leather.

335
00:41:00,698 --> 00:41:03,974
The cow has four sides:
the front, the back,

336
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:07,934
the top and the bottom.

337
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:09,969
- Isn't that good?
- Beastly!

338
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:13,408
Here are my cultural sources.
Le GrandLarousse.

339
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,494
I just copied from it.

340
00:41:16,138 --> 00:41:18,857
Menstruation. Noun.

341
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:23,377
Physiological function
comprising the discharge of menses.

342
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:25,454
Penis. Noun.

343
00:41:25,578 --> 00:41:29,366
Male copulation organ,
measuring five to forty centimetres.

344
00:41:29,498 --> 00:41:31,409
That's Le PetitRobert.

345
00:41:31,538 --> 00:41:33,654
Tom! Tom!

346
00:41:33,778 --> 00:41:36,212
Tom! Look!

347
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:39,730
- Who's that?
- My first love.

348
00:41:39,858 --> 00:41:42,452
- Who?
- My cousin Paul. My first love.

349
00:41:43,098 --> 00:41:45,168
- But his eyes are closed.
- What?

350
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:48,813
- His eyes are closed!
- He played the piano divinely.

351
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,769
That's how I remember him.

352
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:52,854
Sitting at the piano...

353
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,128
His fingers would skim the keys.

354
00:41:55,258 --> 00:41:57,214
He played for hours and hours.

355
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:02,494
At the bottom of the garden,
there were two big trees.

356
00:42:02,618 --> 00:42:04,688
A plane tree and a chestnut tree.

357
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,611
After mass on Sundays,
we used to sit there,

358
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:10,694
each under our own tree.

359
00:42:11,538 --> 00:42:14,894
It was wonderful.
We sat gazing into each other's eyes.

360
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:18,169
Aren't my trees beautiful?
They were my jungle.

361
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:22,607
- What are you doing?
- Having a shit.

362
00:42:22,738 --> 00:42:24,456
No, we're doing a poo.

363
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:28,173
- Shame on you, doing it in my jungle!
- Watch out! Run for it!

364
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:31,734
Oh, these dirty little Arabs!
Go and shit in your own country!

365
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,449
Keep filming. Keep filming!

366
00:42:36,698 --> 00:42:38,689
Don't stop, whatever you do!

367
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:47,934
- Did you get it?
- Everything.

368
00:42:48,058 --> 00:42:52,495
Olympia was great. It'll give a good idea
of race relations in the suburbs of Paris.

369
00:42:52,618 --> 00:42:54,574
It's a real jungle here.

370
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,654
So, tell me about your father.

371
00:42:56,778 --> 00:42:59,008
- I thought we'd finished.
- Five minutes.

372
00:42:59,138 --> 00:43:02,175
- I'm meeting someone for work.
- But the colonel...

373
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:07,356
The colonel had green eyes
and shiny boots.

374
00:43:08,078 --> 00:43:10,034
I worshipped him.

375
00:43:10,158 --> 00:43:12,353
He was so handsome in his uniform.

376
00:43:12,478 --> 00:43:14,833
What a steaming pile of horseshit.

377
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:17,794
What? Don't...

378
00:43:21,798 --> 00:43:23,754
All uniforms are bullshit.

379
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:26,631
Everything outside this place is bullshit.

380
00:43:27,678 --> 00:43:32,354
Besides, I don't want to hear about
your stories, about your past, and all that.

381
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:34,634
He died in Algeria in '58.

382
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:38,951
Or '68 or '28 or '98.

383
00:43:39,078 --> 00:43:41,956
'58. And don't joke about things like that.

384
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:46,629
Why don't you stop talking
about things that don't matter here?

385
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,874
What the hell's the difference?

386
00:43:48,998 --> 00:43:50,954
OK.

387
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:55,754
So what do I have to say?
What do I have to do?

388
00:43:57,238 --> 00:43:59,194
Come on the good ship...

389
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:00,831
Lollipop...

390
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:21,068
Why don't you go back in America?

391
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:32,834
I don't know.

392
00:44:34,398 --> 00:44:36,354
Bad memories, I guess.

393
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,634
Of what?

394
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:44,314
Oh...

395
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,674
My father was a...

396
00:44:50,158 --> 00:44:52,114
..a drunk.

397
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:58,108
Tough. Whore-fucker, bar-fighter.
Super-masculine.

398
00:44:59,878 --> 00:45:01,834
And he was tough.

399
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:05,034
My mother was very...

400
00:45:06,478 --> 00:45:08,434
Very poetic.

401
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:10,794
And also a drunk.

402
00:45:12,598 --> 00:45:14,395
And...

403
00:45:14,518 --> 00:45:18,193
one of my memories, when I was a kid,

404
00:45:19,278 --> 00:45:21,712
was of her being arrested nude.

405
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:23,794
We lived in this small town.

406
00:45:24,078 --> 00:45:26,592
Farming community. We lived on a farm.

407
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:31,673
And I'd come home after school

408
00:45:34,158 --> 00:45:36,114
and she'd be gone.

409
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:39,068
In jail... or something.

410
00:45:41,558 --> 00:45:43,514
And...

411
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:49,994
I used to...

412
00:45:50,118 --> 00:45:52,109
I used to have to milk a cow

413
00:45:52,238 --> 00:45:55,594
every morning and every night
and I liked that.

414
00:45:57,918 --> 00:45:59,874
I remember...

415
00:46:00,518 --> 00:46:03,237
one time I was all dressed up

416
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:07,594
to go out and take this girl
to a basketball game.

417
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:13,274
And I started to go out and my father
said, "You have to milk the cow."

418
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:16,231
I said, "Would you please milk it for me?"

419
00:46:17,398 --> 00:46:20,231
And he said, "No, get your ass out there."

420
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:25,793
So I went out and I was in a hurry and
didn't have time to change my shoes.

421
00:46:25,918 --> 00:46:29,274
And I had cowshit all over my shoes.

422
00:46:29,798 --> 00:46:33,950
And on the way to the basketball game,
it smelled in the car.

423
00:46:41,638 --> 00:46:43,594
I don't know.

424
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:48,233
I-l can't remember very many good things.

425
00:46:50,118 --> 00:46:52,074
Not one?

426
00:46:52,198 --> 00:46:54,154
Yeah. Some.

427
00:46:55,878 --> 00:46:58,312
There was a farmer, a very nice guy.

428
00:46:58,438 --> 00:47:00,588
Old guy, very poor,
and worked real hard.

429
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:05,633
I used to work in a ditch,
draining land for farming.

430
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,514
And he wore overalls
and he smoked a clay pipe.

431
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:15,595
Half the time
he wouldn't put tobacco in it.

432
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:17,954
And I hated the work.

433
00:47:18,278 --> 00:47:20,234
It was hot and dirty and...

434
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:23,275
it broke my back.

435
00:47:23,398 --> 00:47:25,354
And...

436
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:30,029
all day long I'd watch his spit
which would run down the pipe stem

437
00:47:30,158 --> 00:47:32,194
and hang on the bowl of the pipe.

438
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:37,910
And I used to make bets with myself
on when it was going to fall off.

439
00:47:38,038 --> 00:47:39,994
And I always lost.

440
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:42,074
I never saw it fall off.

441
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:47,391
I'd just look around and it'd be gone
and then the new one would be there.

442
00:47:47,518 --> 00:47:49,588
And then we had a beautiful...

443
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:52,634
My mother...

444
00:47:52,758 --> 00:47:54,828
My mother taught me to love nature.

445
00:47:56,278 --> 00:47:58,234
And...

446
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:00,952
I guess that was the most she could do.

447
00:48:03,078 --> 00:48:05,034
And... we had...

448
00:48:05,158 --> 00:48:09,595
In front of our house
we had this big field... meadow.

449
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:12,876
It was a mustard field in the summer

450
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:15,990
and we had a big black dog
named Dutchy.

451
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:19,988
She used to hunt for rabbits in that field

452
00:48:20,118 --> 00:48:22,313
but she couldn't see them.

453
00:48:22,438 --> 00:48:27,034
So she'd have to leap up in this mustard
field and look around very quickly

454
00:48:27,158 --> 00:48:29,513
to see where the rabbits were.

455
00:48:29,638 --> 00:48:31,594
And it was...

456
00:48:31,718 --> 00:48:33,754
very beautiful.

457
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:36,713
And she never caught the rabbits.

458
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:38,794
You have been had!

459
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:40,874
Oh, really?

460
00:48:40,998 --> 00:48:46,231
I don't wanna know anything
about your past, baby!

461
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:48,394
You think I was telling you the truth?

462
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,914
Maybe.

463
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:55,752
Maybe.

464
00:49:04,266 --> 00:49:07,064
I'm a Red Riding Hood
and you're the wolf.

465
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,742
What strong arms you have!

466
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:21,019
The better to squeeze a fart out of you!

467
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,579
What long nails you have!

468
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:28,900
The better to scratch your ass with.

469
00:49:33,066 --> 00:49:35,057
Oh, what a lot of fur you have!

470
00:49:38,346 --> 00:49:41,463
The better to let your crabs hide in.

471
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:49,901
Ooh, what a long tongue you have!

472
00:49:51,546 --> 00:49:53,298
The better to...

473
00:49:53,426 --> 00:49:56,418
to stick in your rear, my dear.

474
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:10,262
What's this for?

475
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:14,581
That's your happiness and my...

476
00:50:15,586 --> 00:50:17,542
my ha-penis.

477
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,258
Peanuts?

478
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:21,297
Schlong.

479
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:23,382
Wienerwurst.

480
00:50:24,546 --> 00:50:26,343
Cazzo.

481
00:50:26,466 --> 00:50:28,855
Bitte. Prick! Joint!

482
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:35,166
It's funny.

483
00:50:35,294 --> 00:50:38,047
It's like playing grown-ups
when you're little.

484
00:50:38,974 --> 00:50:41,044
I feel like a child again here.

485
00:50:42,054 --> 00:50:44,010
Did you have fun as a kid?

486
00:50:44,134 --> 00:50:46,090
It's the most beautiful thing.

487
00:50:46,214 --> 00:50:49,172
It's beautiful to be made
into a tattletale

488
00:50:49,854 --> 00:50:52,049
or forced to admire authority

489
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,449
or sell yourself for a piece of candy.

490
00:50:54,574 --> 00:50:57,327
- I wasn't like that.
- No?

491
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,410
I was writing poems.

492
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:03,288
I was drawing castles,...
big castles with tower.

493
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:05,890
A lot of tower.

494
00:51:07,974 --> 00:51:11,171
- You never thought about sex?
- No. No sex.

495
00:51:11,294 --> 00:51:13,649
- "No. No sex."
- Tower.

496
00:51:15,414 --> 00:51:17,848
You were probably in love
with your teacher.

497
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:21,410
- My teacher was a woman.
- Then she was a lesbian.

498
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:24,207
- How did you know?
- That's classical.

499
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:26,290
But anyway.

500
00:51:26,894 --> 00:51:29,249
My first love was my cousin Paul.

501
00:51:29,374 --> 00:51:30,932
No!

502
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:34,683
I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid
if you keep telling me names.

503
00:51:34,814 --> 00:51:39,330
No names. I don't mind if you tell
the truth, but don't give me the names.

504
00:51:39,454 --> 00:51:42,969
Sorry. Sorry.

505
00:51:44,974 --> 00:51:47,408
Well, go on. Tell the truth.

506
00:51:48,254 --> 00:51:50,131
What else?

507
00:51:50,254 --> 00:51:53,246
I was 13. He was dark, very thin.

508
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:58,523
I can see him. Big nose! A big romance.

509
00:51:58,654 --> 00:52:02,408
I fell in love with him
when I heard him playing piano.

510
00:52:02,534 --> 00:52:05,173
You mean when he first
got into your knickers.

511
00:52:05,294 --> 00:52:08,411
He was a child prodigy.
He was playing with both hands.

512
00:52:08,534 --> 00:52:10,411
I'll bet he was.

513
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:12,809
Probably getting his kicks.

514
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:14,890
We were dying of heat.

515
00:52:15,014 --> 00:52:18,370
Oh, yeah.
Good excuse. What else?

516
00:52:19,174 --> 00:52:22,962
In the afternoon,
when the grown-ups were napping...

517
00:52:23,094 --> 00:52:25,688
- You started grabbing his joint.
- You're crazy!

518
00:52:25,814 --> 00:52:28,009
- Well, he touched you.
- I never let him!

519
00:52:28,134 --> 00:52:29,692
Oh!

520
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:33,568
Liar, liar, pants on fire,
nose as long as a telephone wire.

521
00:52:33,694 --> 00:52:35,446
No, I'm not.

522
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:40,090
Look me straight in the face and say,
"He didn't touch me once."

523
00:52:40,214 --> 00:52:43,490
- Huh?
- He touched me, but the way he did it.

524
00:52:43,614 --> 00:52:46,651
Aha! The way he did it.

525
00:52:46,774 --> 00:52:48,730
OK, what did he do?

526
00:52:48,854 --> 00:52:51,049
Behind the house, there were two trees.

527
00:52:51,174 --> 00:52:53,130
A plane tree and a chestnut.

528
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:57,008
I sat under the plane tree
and he sat under the chestnut.

529
00:52:57,134 --> 00:53:00,365
And one, two, three...
We each began to masturbate.

530
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:02,450
The first who came...

531
00:53:02,574 --> 00:53:04,530
won!

532
00:53:10,214 --> 00:53:12,569
Why aren't you listening to me?

533
00:53:14,174 --> 00:53:16,768
When did you first come?
How old were you?

534
00:53:17,454 --> 00:53:19,410
The first time?

535
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:22,568
I was really late for school.

536
00:53:22,694 --> 00:53:25,572
I started running and it was downhill.

537
00:53:26,854 --> 00:53:30,130
All of a sudden,
I felt a strong sensation here.

538
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:32,651
So I ran and ran

539
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:34,685
and I came as I ran.

540
00:53:34,814 --> 00:53:37,806
The faster I ran, the better it was
and the more I came.

541
00:53:38,454 --> 00:53:41,366
A couple of days later,
I tried to do it again,

542
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:43,450
but no luck.

543
00:53:49,054 --> 00:53:51,204
Why aren't you listening to me?

544
00:53:52,494 --> 00:53:56,203
Why do I feel like I'm talking
to a brick wall when I talk to you?

545
00:53:56,334 --> 00:53:58,290
Your solitude weighs on me.

546
00:53:58,414 --> 00:54:00,769
It isn't indulgent. It isn't generous.

547
00:54:00,894 --> 00:54:02,850
You are selfish!

548
00:54:07,054 --> 00:54:09,204
I can be by myself, too, you know!

549
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,597
I can't sleep with this music.

550
00:56:53,207 --> 00:56:56,916
I came to this hotel a long time ago,
to spend one night.

551
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,003
And I stayed for five years.

552
00:56:59,407 --> 00:57:01,762
When Papa and I had the hotel,

553
00:57:01,887 --> 00:57:03,878
people came here to sleep.

554
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,963
Now, there's all sorts.

555
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:11,005
They can hide, take drugs, play music.

556
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:18,043
Take your hand away.

557
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:20,522
You're not alone, Paul. I'm here.

558
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:27,644
You're crazy!

559
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:29,758
I'm starting to understand.

560
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:32,242
Do you want me to make them shut up?

561
00:57:34,007 --> 00:57:36,885
OK. I'll make them shut up.

562
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,082
- What are you doing, Paul?
- I'm afraid!

563
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:43,244
What's the matter, Mother?
Are you upset? Don't be.

564
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:45,323
There's nothing to be upset about.

565
00:57:45,447 --> 00:57:47,563
It takes so little to make them afraid.

566
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:49,643
I'll tell you what they're afraid of.

567
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,997
They're afraid of the dark. Imagine that!

568
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,357
Come on, Mother. Meet my friends.

569
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:55,636
Put the light on!

570
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:58,201
You should meet
a few clients of the hotel.

571
00:57:58,327 --> 00:58:01,205
Hey, folks.
I'd like you to say hello to Mom.

572
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:03,921
Mom, this is Mr Juicehead Junky here.

573
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,639
And...

574
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:09,476
Mr Saxophone, he's...
He's our connection, Mom.

575
00:58:09,607 --> 00:58:12,121
He gives us some hard stuff
once in a while.

576
00:58:12,247 --> 00:58:15,922
And right here
is the beautiful Miss Blowjob 1933.

577
00:58:16,047 --> 00:58:19,323
She still makes a few points
when she takes her teeth out.

578
00:58:19,447 --> 00:58:20,880
The light, Paul.

579
00:58:21,007 --> 00:58:23,157
Say hello, Mom! This is Mom!

580
00:58:23,287 --> 00:58:25,323
Oh! You afraid of the dark, Mom?

581
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:28,166
She's afraid of the dark. Oh, poor thing.

582
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:32,565
All right, sweetheart. I'll take care of you.
I'll give you a little light.

583
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:35,485
I'll give you a little light.
Don't you worry.

584
00:58:56,251 --> 00:58:58,811
- Good evening, madame.
- Good evening.

585
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:05,127
Good evening, Marcel.

586
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,127
Goodnight, Paul.

587
00:59:18,971 --> 00:59:20,927
Who's that?

588
00:59:21,051 --> 00:59:22,882
Do you like him?

589
00:59:23,011 --> 00:59:24,967
He was Rosa's lover.

590
00:59:58,247 --> 01:00:01,637
What am I doing
in this apartment with you?

591
01:00:01,767 --> 01:00:03,519
Love?

592
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:05,319
Well...

593
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:08,405
Let's say we're just taking a flying...

594
01:00:08,527 --> 01:00:10,722
a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut.

595
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:14,363
So you think I'm a wore.

596
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:17,684
I think you're a what? A what? A wore?

597
01:00:17,807 --> 01:00:19,763
- A wore.
- You mean whore.

598
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:21,923
Yes, a whore. Whore.

599
01:00:22,047 --> 01:00:25,960
No, you're just a good old-fashioned girl...
trying to get along.

600
01:00:26,087 --> 01:00:28,203
I prefer to be a whore.

601
01:00:29,327 --> 01:00:31,841
Why were you going through
my pockets?

602
01:00:31,967 --> 01:00:33,923
To find out who you are.

603
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:37,883
- To find out who you are.
- Yes.

604
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:42,239
Well, if you look real close,
you'll see me hiding behind my zipper.

605
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:47,196
Well, we know that he buys clothes
in some big store.

606
01:00:48,087 --> 01:00:50,043
That's not much.

607
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:52,123
But it's a beginning.

608
01:00:52,247 --> 01:00:55,080
That's not a beginning, that's a finish.

609
01:00:55,207 --> 01:00:57,880
Well, OK. Let's forget it.

610
01:00:58,767 --> 01:01:01,998
- How old are you?
- I'll be 93 this weekend.

611
01:01:02,127 --> 01:01:05,085
- Oh, you don't look it!
- Thank you.

612
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:08,761
- Have you been in college?
- Oh, yeah.

613
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:11,923
Yeah. I went to...

614
01:01:12,767 --> 01:01:14,723
the University of Congo.

615
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:16,803
- Studied whale-fucking.
- Wow!

616
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,476
Barbers don't usually go to university.

617
01:01:22,807 --> 01:01:25,640
Are you telling me
that I look like a barber?

618
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:27,997
No, but that's a razor's barber.

619
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:30,723
That's a barber's razor.

620
01:01:31,127 --> 01:01:33,083
Barber's razors, yes.

621
01:01:33,927 --> 01:01:35,883
Or a madman's.

622
01:01:38,847 --> 01:01:40,803
So you want to cut me up?

623
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:43,564
No.

624
01:01:43,687 --> 01:01:46,520
That would be like
writing my name on your face.

625
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:48,603
Like they do to slaves?

626
01:01:48,727 --> 01:01:51,560
Slaves are branded on the ass
and I want you free.

627
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:53,643
Free?! I'm not free!

628
01:01:54,687 --> 01:01:56,643
You want to know why...

629
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:59,565
why you don't want to know
anything about me?

630
01:01:59,687 --> 01:02:02,565
- Because you hate women.
- Oh, really?

631
01:02:02,687 --> 01:02:04,837
What have they ever done to you?

632
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:10,965
Well,... either they always
pretend to know who I am

633
01:02:11,087 --> 01:02:13,681
or they pretend
I don't know who they are

634
01:02:13,807 --> 01:02:15,763
and that's very boring.

635
01:02:18,327 --> 01:02:20,204
I'm not afraid to say who I am.

636
01:02:20,327 --> 01:02:21,442
I am 20 years old...

637
01:02:21,567 --> 01:02:22,966
No! Jesus Christ!

638
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:25,043
Don't... Where is your brain?

639
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:27,123
State zitta.

640
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:29,397
Halt's Maul, Schweinehund.
Shut up.

641
01:02:31,607 --> 01:02:33,563
Get it?

642
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:39,036
I know it's tough
but you're gonna have to bear it.

643
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:42,884
You know, these sinks are really beautiful.

644
01:02:43,687 --> 01:02:46,804
They're very rare,
you don't find them any more.

645
01:02:46,927 --> 01:02:50,363
I think it's these sinks
that let you stay together.

646
01:02:51,607 --> 01:02:53,563
Don't you think?

647
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,877
What's that? What's all this?

648
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,963
Mad? Mad?

649
01:03:00,087 --> 01:03:01,236
Mad? Mad?

650
01:03:08,927 --> 01:03:10,883
I think I'm happy with you.

651
01:03:14,367 --> 01:03:16,164
Again!

652
01:03:16,287 --> 01:03:18,243
Do it again!

653
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:20,244
Again!

654
01:03:23,407 --> 01:03:25,637
I'm coming! I'm ready.

655
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:28,803
Shall we leave together?

656
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:38,439
Bastard!

657
01:03:38,567 --> 01:03:40,637
He's a git! Not even goodbye!

658
01:04:15,447 --> 01:04:19,042
- Tom!
- Jeanne!

659
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:22,239
What are you doing there?
I'm coming! I'll fly!

660
01:04:23,127 --> 01:04:27,040
- Wait! I've got to talk to you.
- Why didn't you speak on the phone?

661
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,486
What's up?

662
01:04:28,607 --> 01:04:30,563
- You must find someone else.
- For what?

663
01:04:30,687 --> 01:04:32,643
- For your film.
- Why?

664
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:36,080
Because you're taking advantage of me.

665
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:39,563
Because you make me do things
I've never done.

666
01:04:39,687 --> 01:04:41,757
Because you're taking up my time.

667
01:04:41,887 --> 01:04:44,117
You make me do whatever you want.

668
01:04:46,647 --> 01:04:48,399
The film is over!

669
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,403
I'm tired of being raped!

670
01:05:47,387 --> 01:05:48,456
Come in!

671
01:05:48,587 --> 01:05:51,101
You wanted to talk to me. Go on, then.

672
01:05:53,067 --> 01:05:56,104
You know I haven't come
to cry with you?

673
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:59,497
Do you mind if I carry on working?

674
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:04,944
It helps me a lot
after what has happened.

675
01:06:08,027 --> 01:06:09,983
Identical.

676
01:06:10,107 --> 01:06:12,063
Rosa wanted them identical.

677
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:14,018
Our bathrobes?

678
01:06:14,147 --> 01:06:17,776
You can't tell me anything
I don't already know?

679
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,057
Same colour, same pattern.

680
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:23,699
Yes, yes, yes.

681
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:27,743
You're meticulous.

682
01:06:29,387 --> 01:06:34,017
I've always wondered why
you save newspaper clippings.

683
01:06:35,467 --> 01:06:37,423
Is it work? Or a hobby?

684
01:06:37,547 --> 01:06:40,539
Hobby? I don't like that word.

685
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:44,342
Let's say it's some extra cash.
I do it for an agency.

686
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,981
Oh, so it's serious.

687
01:06:47,627 --> 01:06:49,583
It's a job that makes you read?

688
01:06:49,707 --> 01:06:51,663
Very educational.

689
01:06:53,027 --> 01:06:54,983
Be honest.

690
01:06:55,107 --> 01:06:57,667
You didn't know
we had the same bathrobes.

691
01:06:59,427 --> 01:07:01,383
Marcello.

692
01:07:03,347 --> 01:07:05,702
We've got a lot of things in common.

693
01:07:08,347 --> 01:07:10,417
Marcello, I know everything.

694
01:07:12,267 --> 01:07:14,861
No, Rosa often talked to me about you.

695
01:07:17,507 --> 01:07:21,386
I don't think there are
many marriages like that.

696
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:24,823
It's strange.

697
01:07:28,027 --> 01:07:29,983
I'm thirsty.

698
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:37,340
- Would you like a shot of bourbon?
- Hold on.

699
01:07:47,547 --> 01:07:49,503
Here's the bourbon.

700
01:07:54,627 --> 01:07:56,982
Was that a present from Rosa, too?

701
01:07:58,947 --> 01:08:01,097
I don't really like bourbon,

702
01:08:01,227 --> 01:08:04,822
but Rosa wanted me
to keep a bottle here in my room.

703
01:08:11,867 --> 01:08:14,301
I was asking myself this question.

704
01:08:15,987 --> 01:08:18,217
If, with these little things,

705
01:08:18,347 --> 01:08:20,702
unimportant things,

706
01:08:22,147 --> 01:08:26,186
we could go back over things,
and understand together.

707
01:08:26,307 --> 01:08:28,138
Together?

708
01:08:28,267 --> 01:08:30,223
It's almost a year that Rosa and l...

709
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:33,339
Not passionately, but regularly...

710
01:08:34,107 --> 01:08:36,667
I thought I knew her
as much as you can know...

711
01:08:36,787 --> 01:08:39,221
- Your mistress.
- For example,

712
01:08:40,267 --> 01:08:44,897
a while ago, something happened
that I still don't understand.

713
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:49,583
Do you see there, on the wall?

714
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:54,341
She had climbed onto the bed

715
01:08:56,147 --> 01:08:59,776
and she was trying to tear at the walls
with her hands.

716
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:04,983
I stopped her because
she was breaking her nails.

717
01:09:06,427 --> 01:09:10,420
She had a strange... violence about her.

718
01:09:11,827 --> 01:09:14,057
I'd never seen her like that.

719
01:09:16,307 --> 01:09:18,263
Our room is painted white.

720
01:09:19,227 --> 01:09:23,186
Rosa wanted it to be different
from the other rooms in the hotel.

721
01:09:23,307 --> 01:09:25,263
To make it look like...

722
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:28,663
a more normal home.

723
01:09:29,227 --> 01:09:30,785
But...

724
01:09:30,907 --> 01:09:32,898
it had to be changed here, too.

725
01:09:34,227 --> 01:09:36,582
I think she started with the wall.

726
01:09:40,987 --> 01:09:43,342
A cold sore. I don't know. Shit.

727
01:09:47,147 --> 01:09:49,103
You're lucky?

728
01:09:50,027 --> 01:09:53,815
You were...
You must have been very handsome...

729
01:09:53,947 --> 01:09:55,903
..20 years ago.

730
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,983
Not as much as you.

731
01:10:01,907 --> 01:10:04,057
You've still got all your hair.

732
01:10:04,267 --> 01:10:07,100
My hair... I have to have it trimmed often.

733
01:10:07,227 --> 01:10:09,821
And wash it. I wash it nearly every day.

734
01:10:10,387 --> 01:10:12,343
Don't you have massages?

735
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,623
Yes, I do.

736
01:10:15,747 --> 01:10:17,703
You're in good shape.

737
01:10:18,467 --> 01:10:21,823
What do you do for... your stomach?

738
01:10:21,947 --> 01:10:23,903
That's my problem.

739
01:10:24,947 --> 01:10:28,496
For that... I have a secret.

740
01:10:28,627 --> 01:10:30,583
Tell me!

741
01:10:37,907 --> 01:10:41,616
Are you leaving us?
I saw your suitcase was packed.

742
01:10:41,747 --> 01:10:44,181
Ah... America.

743
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:46,457
Why was she unfaithful to you?

744
01:10:46,587 --> 01:10:48,543
You can't believe that Rosa...

745
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:50,623
killed herself.

746
01:10:53,827 --> 01:10:55,783
It's hard for me to...

747
01:10:55,907 --> 01:10:58,023
believe, too.

748
01:11:00,107 --> 01:11:02,063
This is my secret!

749
01:11:02,907 --> 01:11:05,341
Thirty times every morning.

750
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:14,823
Really, Marcello,

751
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:21,101
I wonder what she ever saw in you.

752
01:11:26,124 --> 01:11:28,080
Are you in?

753
01:11:30,844 --> 01:11:32,800
Is anyone here?

754
01:11:43,324 --> 01:11:45,280
Hi, monster.

755
01:11:58,444 --> 01:12:00,400
Is something wrong?

756
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:03,755
- There's butter in the kitchen.
- So you're here?

757
01:12:03,884 --> 01:12:06,637
- Why didn't you answer?
- Go get the butter.

758
01:12:06,764 --> 01:12:09,039
I have to hurry. I have a cab waiting.

759
01:12:09,164 --> 01:12:11,120
Go get the butter.

760
01:12:22,764 --> 01:12:24,720
It makes me crazy!

761
01:12:24,844 --> 01:12:28,359
That you're so damned sure
that I'm coming back here.

762
01:12:29,164 --> 01:12:31,120
Do you really think

763
01:12:31,244 --> 01:12:34,600
that an American sitting
on the floor in an empty flat

764
01:12:34,724 --> 01:12:37,716
eating cheese and drinking water
is interesting?

765
01:12:39,804 --> 01:12:42,682
There's something under here.
Can you hear it?

766
01:12:42,804 --> 01:12:44,283
It's hollow.

767
01:12:44,404 --> 01:12:46,201
Can you hear it?

768
01:12:46,324 --> 01:12:49,077
- It's hollow.
- That's a hiding place.

769
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:56,959
- Don't open it!
- Why not?

770
01:12:57,444 --> 01:12:59,400
I don't know. Don't open it.

771
01:13:00,444 --> 01:13:02,753
What about that? Can I open that?

772
01:13:09,004 --> 01:13:10,562
Wait a minute.

773
01:13:10,684 --> 01:13:12,834
Maybe there's jewels in it.

774
01:13:14,884 --> 01:13:16,840
Maybe there's gold.

775
01:13:20,004 --> 01:13:21,756
- Are you afraid?
- No.

776
01:13:21,884 --> 01:13:23,840
No?

777
01:13:27,244 --> 01:13:29,200
You're always afraid.

778
01:13:31,404 --> 01:13:34,953
No, but... maybe there is
some family secrets inside.

779
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:37,600
Family secrets?

780
01:13:39,524 --> 01:13:41,879
I'll tell you about family secrets.

781
01:13:43,604 --> 01:13:45,356
What are you doing?

782
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:48,643
I'm gonna tell you about the family.

783
01:13:53,684 --> 01:13:55,640
That holy institution

784
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,198
meant to breed virtue in savages.

785
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,160
I want you to repeat it after me.

786
01:14:04,284 --> 01:14:06,514
No and no!

787
01:14:07,244 --> 01:14:09,200
- No!
- Repeat it.

788
01:14:09,924 --> 01:14:11,960
Say, "Holy family."

789
01:14:13,404 --> 01:14:15,315
Come on, say it.

790
01:14:15,444 --> 01:14:17,514
Go on. Holy family.

791
01:14:18,164 --> 01:14:20,120
Church of good citizens.

792
01:14:20,244 --> 01:14:22,200
Church...

793
01:14:24,004 --> 01:14:26,154
- Good citizens.
- Good citizens...

794
01:14:29,844 --> 01:14:31,800
Say it. Say it!

795
01:14:31,924 --> 01:14:35,633
The children are tortured
until they tell their first lie.

796
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:37,720
The children...

797
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:39,721
are tortured...

798
01:14:41,684 --> 01:14:43,640
Where the will is broken

799
01:14:44,484 --> 01:14:46,440
by repression.

800
01:14:46,564 --> 01:14:50,000
Where the will... broken... repression.

801
01:14:50,124 --> 01:14:52,080
Where freedom...

802
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:55,157
Free... Freedom!

803
01:14:55,284 --> 01:14:57,240
..is assassinated.

804
01:14:57,364 --> 01:15:00,003
Freedom is assassinated by egotism.

805
01:15:05,204 --> 01:15:07,160
Family...

806
01:15:07,484 --> 01:15:08,883
Family...

807
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,960
You...

808
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:13,960
You...

809
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:17,363
You... You f...

810
01:15:18,084 --> 01:15:20,040
You...

811
01:15:20,164 --> 01:15:22,120
fucking...

812
01:15:23,284 --> 01:15:25,957
fucking... family.

813
01:15:28,164 --> 01:15:30,120
You fucking...

814
01:15:30,724 --> 01:15:32,680
family!

815
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:36,202
Oh, God... Jesus.

816
01:15:37,004 --> 01:15:38,960
Oh, you...

817
01:15:41,084 --> 01:15:42,961
Oh...

818
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:15,837
Shit!

819
01:16:19,484 --> 01:16:21,236
Hey, you!

820
01:16:22,684 --> 01:16:24,640
Yes, you!

821
01:16:26,284 --> 01:16:28,559
I've got a surprise for you.

822
01:16:29,684 --> 01:16:33,199
- What?
- I've got a surprise for you!

823
01:16:34,484 --> 01:16:36,440
That's good.

824
01:16:37,484 --> 01:16:39,440
I like surprises.

825
01:16:52,364 --> 01:16:53,763
What is it?

826
01:16:53,884 --> 01:16:56,478
Music. But I don't know how to work it.

827
01:17:06,924 --> 01:17:08,880
Do you enjoy that?

828
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:49,161
Do you know why I sent the others away?

829
01:17:49,284 --> 01:17:52,356
Because you're angry,
or you want to be alone with me?

830
01:17:52,484 --> 01:17:54,600
And why do I want to be alone with you?

831
01:17:54,724 --> 01:17:57,238
You have something
really serious to tell me.

832
01:17:57,364 --> 01:18:00,117
I have something really very serious
to tell you.

833
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:04,040
- Is it happy or sad?
- It's a secret.

834
01:18:04,164 --> 01:18:06,758
So it's happy.
What sort of secret?

835
01:18:06,884 --> 01:18:09,921
- A secret...
- Speak up! I can't hear anything.

836
01:18:10,044 --> 01:18:13,116
- ..between a man and a woman.
- Is it dirty or is it about love?

837
01:18:14,164 --> 01:18:16,120
About love. But that's not all.

838
01:18:16,244 --> 01:18:18,883
A secret about love, but which isn't love.

839
01:18:19,004 --> 01:18:20,960
What is it?!

840
01:18:23,404 --> 01:18:25,838
That in a week I'm marrying you.

841
01:18:25,964 --> 01:18:27,841
- What?
- I'm marrying you.

842
01:18:28,164 --> 01:18:30,120
- What?!
- I'm marrying you!

843
01:18:30,244 --> 01:18:31,802
- You're marrying me?
- Yes!

844
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:33,596
- We're getting married?
- Yes.

845
01:18:33,724 --> 01:18:34,793
- No?
- Yes.

846
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:35,874
- No!
- Yes.

847
01:18:36,004 --> 01:18:36,834
- Yes?
- Yes.

848
01:18:36,964 --> 01:18:38,841
- No.
- Yes.

849
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,317
- Yes?
- No.

850
01:18:40,444 --> 01:18:42,878
- Are we getting married or not?
- I don't know.

851
01:18:43,004 --> 01:18:44,437
- So, yes, then?
- Yes!

852
01:18:44,564 --> 01:18:45,713
- No!
- Yes!

853
01:18:45,844 --> 01:18:47,721
- Yes.
- No.

854
01:18:47,844 --> 01:18:49,721
Yes or no?

855
01:18:57,795 --> 01:19:00,309
Of course,
I'll send everything to the country.

856
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,266
What do you think, Jeanne?

857
01:19:02,395 --> 01:19:04,351
Olympia will be happy.

858
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:07,345
I went there yesterday with Tom.

859
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:12,230
She's preparing a family museum.

860
01:19:13,955 --> 01:19:18,187
Of course, I'm not sending the boots.
I'm keeping them with me.

861
01:19:18,995 --> 01:19:21,384
I get strange shivers when I touch them.

862
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:30,151
All these military things never age.

863
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:34,309
When I was little, it seemed really heavy

864
01:19:34,435 --> 01:19:36,391
when Papa taught me how to shoot.

865
01:19:36,515 --> 01:19:38,267
I'm keeping that here.

866
01:19:38,395 --> 01:19:41,831
In a respectable household,
it's useful to have a weapon.

867
01:19:41,955 --> 01:19:43,513
You don't even know how to use it.

868
01:19:43,635 --> 01:19:47,674
The important thing is to have one.
It makes an impression.

869
01:19:51,755 --> 01:19:54,349
You really kept everything of Papa's.

870
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,110
Who's that? His orderly?

871
01:19:59,155 --> 01:20:01,271
- A fine example of a Berber.
- Oh.

872
01:20:01,395 --> 01:20:06,310
A strong race. I tried to employ them
as servants, but it was disastrous.

873
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:09,950
I'm glad I decided to send everything
to the country.

874
01:20:10,075 --> 01:20:12,714
All his things were piling up and piling up.

875
01:20:12,835 --> 01:20:15,827
Don't worry.
You'll soon have all the space you want.

876
01:20:15,955 --> 01:20:17,866
What does that mean?

877
01:20:17,995 --> 01:20:19,747
Nothing.

878
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:23,907
Madame, the colonel's lady,

879
01:20:24,035 --> 01:20:25,866
I announce...

880
01:20:25,995 --> 01:20:29,146
What? What?

881
01:20:29,275 --> 01:20:31,231
On this solemn day...

882
01:20:31,835 --> 01:20:33,791
What? What solemn day?

883
01:20:33,915 --> 01:20:35,985
I'm getting married in a week!

884
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:39,873
- What did you say?
- To Tom! In a week!

885
01:20:39,995 --> 01:20:42,350
- Pardon?
- Tom!

886
01:20:42,475 --> 01:20:44,272
- In a week!
- What are you doing in a week?

887
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:49,036
Five... two!

888
01:20:51,327 --> 01:20:53,887
Move into shot! We're shooting!

889
01:20:57,607 --> 01:21:00,565
So,... how do you see marriage?

890
01:21:01,447 --> 01:21:03,119
- Marriage?
- Yes.

891
01:21:03,247 --> 01:21:05,602
I see it everywhere. All the time.

892
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:07,683
What do you mean, everywhere?

893
01:21:07,807 --> 01:21:11,766
- On walls. On buildings.
- Walls and buildings?

894
01:21:11,887 --> 01:21:15,197
Yes, on advertising hoardings.
What are they selling?

895
01:21:15,327 --> 01:21:19,081
Cars. Tinned meat. Cigarettes.

896
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,596
No. They're all about young couples.

897
01:21:21,727 --> 01:21:23,922
Before marriage, no children.

898
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:26,880
Then the same couple,
married with children.

899
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,599
In short, marriage.

900
01:21:28,727 --> 01:21:31,116
The perfect, ideal, successful marriage.

901
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:33,602
It's no longer the preserve of the Church.

902
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:37,402
The husband was burdened with
responsibilities and the wife nagged.

903
01:21:37,527 --> 01:21:39,597
Now, weddings in advertising smile!

904
01:21:39,727 --> 01:21:42,480
They smile. On posters.

905
01:21:42,607 --> 01:21:46,759
On posters, of course. But why
not take poster marriage seriously?

906
01:21:46,887 --> 01:21:48,843
Marriage... Pop marriage!

907
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,840
Pop? That's the formula.

908
01:21:54,407 --> 01:21:57,797
For pop youth, pop marriage!

909
01:21:57,927 --> 01:22:01,761
But... what if the pop marriage
doesn't work?

910
01:22:01,887 --> 01:22:04,560
Then you have to fix it
like you would a car.

911
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:07,406
The spouses are two workers in overalls

912
01:22:07,527 --> 01:22:09,518
bending over an engine to fix it.

913
01:22:09,647 --> 01:22:13,196
And in case of adultery
what happens to the pop marriage?

914
01:22:13,327 --> 01:22:15,921
In that case,
there are three or four workers.

915
01:22:16,927 --> 01:22:18,883
What about love?

916
01:22:19,007 --> 01:22:20,804
Is love pop?

917
01:22:20,927 --> 01:22:22,724
No. That's not. Love isn't pop.

918
01:22:22,847 --> 01:22:24,917
Love isn't pop. So what is it?

919
01:22:26,367 --> 01:22:28,676
The workers retire to a secret flat,

920
01:22:28,807 --> 01:22:32,482
take off their overalls
and become men and women again

921
01:22:32,607 --> 01:22:34,325
and make love.

922
01:22:46,447 --> 01:22:48,403
You're wonderful.

923
01:22:48,527 --> 01:22:50,483
It's the dress that makes the bride.

924
01:22:52,087 --> 01:22:54,396
You're better than Rita Hayworth.

925
01:22:54,527 --> 01:22:56,483
Better than Joan Crawford!

926
01:22:57,527 --> 01:22:59,643
Better than Kim Novak!

927
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:01,723
Better than Lauren Bacall!

928
01:23:01,847 --> 01:23:03,803
Better than Ava Gardner

929
01:23:03,927 --> 01:23:06,282
when she was Mickey Rooney's lover!

930
01:23:06,407 --> 01:23:09,717
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop, but keep filming!

931
01:23:09,847 --> 01:23:13,078
Why aren't you filming in the rain?
You're crazy!

932
01:23:22,687 --> 01:23:25,201
- Where's Jeanne?
- She must have run off.

933
01:23:25,327 --> 01:23:27,283
When? ln the rain?

934
01:23:27,407 --> 01:23:29,284
Jeanne!

935
01:23:29,407 --> 01:23:33,082
Jeanne! Jeanne!

936
01:23:34,407 --> 01:23:36,762
Jeanne!

937
01:23:57,007 --> 01:23:58,963
Please forgive me!

938
01:23:59,087 --> 01:24:01,043
Forgive me!

939
01:24:02,687 --> 01:24:05,201
I wanted to leave you and I couldn't.

940
01:24:07,647 --> 01:24:10,081
I wanted to leave you and I couldn't.

941
01:24:10,207 --> 01:24:12,084
I can't.

942
01:24:12,207 --> 01:24:14,801
I can't leave you, do you understand?

943
01:24:14,927 --> 01:24:16,883
Do you still want me?

944
01:24:23,807 --> 01:24:25,559
Bang!

945
01:24:45,027 --> 01:24:46,983
Voilà!

946
01:24:48,787 --> 01:24:52,223
Oh, there once was a man

947
01:24:52,347 --> 01:24:54,702
And he had an old sow

948
01:24:56,347 --> 01:24:59,020
Ow! Hi-diddle-dow...

949
01:25:00,307 --> 01:25:02,696
You're wet.

950
01:25:21,227 --> 01:25:23,183
A rat.

951
01:25:23,307 --> 01:25:25,263
Only a rat.

952
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:27,617
There are more rats in Paris than people.

953
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:29,703
Yum, yum, yum.

954
01:25:30,227 --> 01:25:32,183
- I want to go!
- Wait, wait!

955
01:25:32,307 --> 01:25:35,856
Don't you want a bite first?
You don't want to run and eat.

956
01:25:35,987 --> 01:25:37,943
This is the end!

957
01:25:38,587 --> 01:25:42,341
This is the end, but I like to start
with the head. That's the best part.

958
01:25:42,467 --> 01:25:44,423
Are you sure you won't have any?

959
01:25:44,547 --> 01:25:45,775
OK.

960
01:25:48,827 --> 01:25:52,581
- What's the matter? You don't dig rat?
- I wanna go!

961
01:25:52,707 --> 01:25:56,143
I can't make love in this bed any more.
I can't.

962
01:25:56,267 --> 01:25:58,656
It's disgusting! Nauseating!

963
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:01,062
Well, we'll fuck on the radiator

964
01:26:01,187 --> 01:26:03,143
or standing on the mantel.

965
01:26:03,267 --> 01:26:07,146
I gotta get some mayonnaise for this.
It really is good with mayonnaise.

966
01:26:11,427 --> 01:26:13,497
I'll save the asshole for you.

967
01:26:15,947 --> 01:26:18,302
Rat's asshole with mayonnaise!

968
01:26:18,427 --> 01:26:21,100
I want to get out of here. I want to go.

969
01:26:21,707 --> 01:26:23,777
I can't stand it here any more.

970
01:26:25,467 --> 01:26:27,423
Yes. I'm going.

971
01:26:28,747 --> 01:26:30,703
I'm not coming back...

972
01:26:30,827 --> 01:26:32,783
ever.

973
01:26:34,827 --> 01:26:36,783
Quo vadis, baby?

974
01:26:39,147 --> 01:26:41,297
I forgot to tell you something.

975
01:26:41,427 --> 01:26:43,383
I fell in love with somebody.

976
01:26:43,507 --> 01:26:45,463
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

977
01:26:47,107 --> 01:26:50,577
You know, you're going to have
to get out of these wet duds.

978
01:26:50,707 --> 01:26:52,663
I'm going to make love with him!

979
01:26:55,947 --> 01:26:57,903
Well,

980
01:26:58,387 --> 01:27:00,901
first you have to take a hot bath.

981
01:27:04,747 --> 01:27:08,456
Cos if you don't,
you're gonna get pneumonia, right?

982
01:27:09,747 --> 01:27:11,703
Huh?

983
01:27:11,827 --> 01:27:13,783
And then you know what happens?

984
01:27:13,907 --> 01:27:16,375
You get pneumonia,
then you know what happens?

985
01:27:16,507 --> 01:27:18,463
You die.

986
01:27:18,587 --> 01:27:21,704
And then,
you know what happens when you die?

987
01:27:21,827 --> 01:27:23,783
I get to fuck the dead rat.

988
01:27:31,295 --> 01:27:32,489
I'm in love.

989
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:34,651
You're in love? How delightful.

990
01:27:35,455 --> 01:27:37,013
I'm in love!

991
01:27:37,815 --> 01:27:39,771
I'm in love, you understand?

992
01:27:39,895 --> 01:27:42,853
I'm in love, I'm in love! Oh!

993
01:27:42,975 --> 01:27:44,727
I'm in love!

994
01:27:47,615 --> 01:27:49,571
You know, you're old!

995
01:27:49,695 --> 01:27:52,653
- You're getting fat.
- Fat, is it? How unkind.

996
01:27:52,775 --> 01:27:54,731
Half of your hair is out

997
01:27:54,855 --> 01:27:57,574
and the other half is almost white.

998
01:27:57,695 --> 01:28:00,448
In ten years, you'll be
playing soccer with your tits.

999
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:03,487
What do you think of that?
You know what I'm gonna be doing?

1000
01:28:03,615 --> 01:28:06,288
You will be on a... wheelchair!

1001
01:28:06,415 --> 01:28:08,371
Well, maybe.

1002
01:28:08,655 --> 01:28:10,008
But, you know...

1003
01:28:10,135 --> 01:28:13,093
I'll be smirking and giggling
all the way to eternity.

1004
01:28:13,215 --> 01:28:14,807
How poetic.

1005
01:28:14,935 --> 01:28:17,449
But please, before you go, wash my feet.

1006
01:28:17,895 --> 01:28:19,851
OK.

1007
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:22,851
Noblesse oblige.

1008
01:28:26,695 --> 01:28:29,209
You know, he and l, we make love.

1009
01:28:30,135 --> 01:28:33,332
Oh, really? That's wonderful.

1010
01:28:33,455 --> 01:28:35,810
- Is he a good fucker?
- Magnificent.

1011
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:40,331
You know, you're a jerk.

1012
01:28:40,455 --> 01:28:44,733
Cos the best fucking you're gonna get
is right here in this apartment.

1013
01:28:44,855 --> 01:28:46,811
Stand up.

1014
01:28:49,735 --> 01:28:51,691
He is full of mysteries.

1015
01:28:53,135 --> 01:28:55,091
Give me the soap.

1016
01:28:55,215 --> 01:28:57,365
Listen, you dumb dodo.

1017
01:28:57,495 --> 01:29:01,852
All the mysteries that you're ever
gonna know in life are right here.

1018
01:29:01,975 --> 01:29:05,934
He is like everybody but...
at the same time he's different.

1019
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:09,011
You mean, like everybody.

1020
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:11,774
Yeah, but... even he fright me.

1021
01:29:11,895 --> 01:29:13,851
Even he frightens me.

1022
01:29:13,975 --> 01:29:15,966
What is he, your local pimp?

1023
01:29:16,095 --> 01:29:18,245
He could be. He looks it.

1024
01:29:18,695 --> 01:29:20,651
You know why I'm in love with him?

1025
01:29:20,775 --> 01:29:22,413
I can't wait.

1026
01:29:22,535 --> 01:29:26,130
Because he know. He know how
to make me fall in love with him.

1027
01:29:26,255 --> 01:29:29,292
You want this man you love
to protect and take care of you.

1028
01:29:29,415 --> 01:29:30,768
Yeah.

1029
01:29:30,895 --> 01:29:34,012
You want this golden,
shining, powerful warrior

1030
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:37,172
to build a fortress
where you can hide in.

1031
01:29:37,295 --> 01:29:39,286
So you don't have to ever... have...

1032
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:41,371
You don't ever have to be afraid.

1033
01:29:41,495 --> 01:29:43,645
You don't have to feel lonely or empty.

1034
01:29:43,775 --> 01:29:45,891
- That's what you want, isn't it?
- Yes.

1035
01:29:46,015 --> 01:29:49,325
- Well, you'll never find it.
- But I find this man.

1036
01:29:49,455 --> 01:29:53,289
Then it won't be long until he'll want you
to build a fortress for him

1037
01:29:53,415 --> 01:29:56,088
out of your tits
and your cunt and your hair

1038
01:29:56,215 --> 01:29:58,206
and your smile
and the way you smell.

1039
01:29:58,975 --> 01:30:03,332
And... and some place where he can
feel comfortable and secure enough

1040
01:30:03,455 --> 01:30:06,811
so that he can worship
in front of the altar of his own prick.

1041
01:30:06,935 --> 01:30:09,927
- But I find this man!
- No, you're alone.

1042
01:30:10,055 --> 01:30:11,773
You're all alone.

1043
01:30:11,895 --> 01:30:14,534
You won't be free
of that feeling of being alone

1044
01:30:14,655 --> 01:30:16,850
until you look death right in the face.

1045
01:30:16,975 --> 01:30:19,569
I mean, that sounds like bullshit,

1046
01:30:19,695 --> 01:30:21,651
some romantic crap,

1047
01:30:21,775 --> 01:30:24,892
until you go right up
into the ass of death.

1048
01:30:25,655 --> 01:30:29,284
Right up in his ass...
till you find the womb of fear.

1049
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:32,131
And then,... maybe...

1050
01:30:33,055 --> 01:30:35,444
Maybe then, you'll be able to find him.

1051
01:30:35,575 --> 01:30:37,531
But I find this man.

1052
01:30:37,655 --> 01:30:40,328
He's you! You are that man!

1053
01:30:49,275 --> 01:30:51,231
Get me the scissors.

1054
01:30:51,355 --> 01:30:54,188
- What?
- Get me the fingernail scissors.

1055
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:03,111
No. I want you to cut

1056
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:06,673
the fingernails
on your right hand, these two.

1057
01:31:14,755 --> 01:31:16,711
That's it.

1058
01:31:21,635 --> 01:31:23,626
I want you to put your fingers up my ass.

1059
01:31:23,755 --> 01:31:24,585
What?

1060
01:31:24,715 --> 01:31:27,468
Put your fingers up my ass,
are you deaf?

1061
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,191
Go on.

1062
01:31:35,315 --> 01:31:37,271
I'm gonna get a pig...

1063
01:31:37,395 --> 01:31:40,432
and I'm...
I'm gonna have the pig fuck you.

1064
01:31:41,075 --> 01:31:43,384
I want the pig to vomit in your face

1065
01:31:43,515 --> 01:31:45,870
and I want you to swallow the vomit.

1066
01:31:45,995 --> 01:31:47,951
Are you gonna do that for me?

1067
01:31:48,075 --> 01:31:49,633
- Yeah.
- Huh?

1068
01:31:49,755 --> 01:31:50,983
Yeah!

1069
01:31:51,115 --> 01:31:53,026
I want the pig to die while...

1070
01:31:53,155 --> 01:31:55,066
while you're fucking him.

1071
01:31:55,195 --> 01:31:57,106
Then you'll have to go behind him.

1072
01:31:57,235 --> 01:31:59,795
I want you to smell
the dying farts of the pig.

1073
01:32:01,035 --> 01:32:02,991
Are you gonna do all of that for me?

1074
01:32:03,115 --> 01:32:04,867
Yes, and more than that!

1075
01:32:04,995 --> 01:32:06,587
And worse!

1076
01:32:06,715 --> 01:32:08,671
And worse than before.

1077
01:32:17,175 --> 01:32:19,769
You look ridiculous in that make-up.

1078
01:32:19,895 --> 01:32:22,045
Like the caricature of a whore.

1079
01:32:25,575 --> 01:32:28,089
A little touch of Mommy in the night.

1080
01:32:34,735 --> 01:32:37,329
Fake Ophelia drowned in the bathtub.

1081
01:32:44,175 --> 01:32:47,212
I wish you could see yourself.
You'd really laugh.

1082
01:32:49,535 --> 01:32:51,890
You're your mother's masterpiece.

1083
01:32:59,015 --> 01:33:00,971
Christ!

1084
01:33:01,095 --> 01:33:04,883
There are too many fucking flowers
in this place. I can't breathe.

1085
01:33:08,255 --> 01:33:10,485
You know on the top of the closet?

1086
01:33:10,615 --> 01:33:13,288
The cardboard box, I found all your...

1087
01:33:13,415 --> 01:33:15,975
I found all your little goodies.

1088
01:33:16,095 --> 01:33:18,051
Pens, keychains,

1089
01:33:19,495 --> 01:33:23,124
foreign money, French ticklers,
the whole shot.

1090
01:33:24,735 --> 01:33:26,691
Even a clergyman's collar.

1091
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:31,886
I didn't know you collected
all those little knick-knacks left behind.

1092
01:33:35,335 --> 01:33:37,326
Even if the husband lives

1093
01:33:38,495 --> 01:33:40,451
200 fucking years,

1094
01:33:41,695 --> 01:33:45,449
he's never going to be able
to discover his wife's real nature.

1095
01:33:45,575 --> 01:33:47,452
I mean, l...

1096
01:33:47,575 --> 01:33:50,851
I might be able
to comprehend the universe,

1097
01:33:50,975 --> 01:33:52,931
but...

1098
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:57,971
I'll never discover the truth
about you. Never.

1099
01:33:59,215 --> 01:34:01,206
I mean, who the hell were you?

1100
01:34:03,655 --> 01:34:05,611
Remember that day,

1101
01:34:05,735 --> 01:34:07,691
the first day I was there?

1102
01:34:08,695 --> 01:34:12,813
I knew that I couldn't
get into your pants unless I said...

1103
01:34:13,575 --> 01:34:15,531
What did I say?

1104
01:34:16,135 --> 01:34:17,488
Oh, yeah.

1105
01:34:17,615 --> 01:34:21,608
"May I have my bill, please?
I have to leave."

1106
01:34:22,735 --> 01:34:24,691
Remember?

1107
01:34:28,535 --> 01:34:30,491
Last night...

1108
01:34:31,975 --> 01:34:34,808
I ripped off the lights on your mother.

1109
01:34:36,015 --> 01:34:38,370
And the whole joint went bananas.

1110
01:34:41,295 --> 01:34:44,048
All your... guests...

1111
01:34:44,175 --> 01:34:46,131
as you used to call them...

1112
01:34:49,735 --> 01:34:52,772
Well, I guess that includes me, doesn't it?

1113
01:34:54,735 --> 01:34:57,010
It does include me, doesn't it?

1114
01:34:57,135 --> 01:35:02,368
For five years, I was more a guest
in this fucking flophouse than a husband.

1115
01:35:02,495 --> 01:35:04,451
With privileges, of course.

1116
01:35:05,335 --> 01:35:07,769
And then, to help me understand you,

1117
01:35:07,895 --> 01:35:09,886
you let me inherit Marcel.

1118
01:35:10,015 --> 01:35:13,610
The husband's double,
whose room was the double of ours.

1119
01:35:13,735 --> 01:35:15,691
And you know what?

1120
01:35:15,815 --> 01:35:18,090
I didn't even have the guts to ask him.

1121
01:35:18,215 --> 01:35:21,810
Didn't have the guts to ask him
if the same numbers you and I did

1122
01:35:21,935 --> 01:35:24,290
were the same numbers
you did with him.

1123
01:35:24,415 --> 01:35:27,930
Our marriage was nothing more
than a foxhole for you.

1124
01:35:28,535 --> 01:35:33,086
And all it took for you to get out was
a 35-cent razor and a tub full of water.

1125
01:35:33,215 --> 01:35:36,651
You cheap, goddamn, fucking,
godforsaken whore.

1126
01:35:36,775 --> 01:35:38,731
I hope you rot in hell.

1127
01:35:38,855 --> 01:35:43,849
You're worse than the dirtiest street pig
anybody could find, and you know why?

1128
01:35:43,975 --> 01:35:46,125
You know why? Because you lied.

1129
01:35:46,255 --> 01:35:49,088
You lied to me and I trusted you.
You lied.

1130
01:35:49,215 --> 01:35:51,171
You knew you were lying!

1131
01:35:52,335 --> 01:35:54,326
Go on, tell me you didn't lie.

1132
01:35:54,855 --> 01:35:57,415
Haven't you got anything
to say about that?

1133
01:35:57,535 --> 01:36:00,732
You can think up something, can't you?

1134
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:03,608
Go on, tell me something!
Smile, you cunt!

1135
01:36:05,615 --> 01:36:08,254
Go on, tell me... tell me something sweet.

1136
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:11,128
Smile at me and say I just misunderstood.

1137
01:36:13,335 --> 01:36:15,007
Go on, tell me.

1138
01:36:15,135 --> 01:36:17,091
You pig-fucker!

1139
01:36:18,055 --> 01:36:21,889
You goddamn, fucking, pig-fucking liar.

1140
01:36:26,495 --> 01:36:28,451
Rosa,

1141
01:36:31,415 --> 01:36:33,371
I'm sorry...

1142
01:36:35,495 --> 01:36:37,213
I just can't...

1143
01:36:37,335 --> 01:36:39,291
I can't stand it...

1144
01:36:39,575 --> 01:36:43,329
to see these goddamn things
on your face.

1145
01:36:50,535 --> 01:36:52,491
You never wore make-up.

1146
01:36:52,935 --> 01:36:56,723
This fucking shit.
I'm gonna take this off your mouth.

1147
01:36:57,975 --> 01:36:59,931
This lipstick...

1148
01:37:01,335 --> 01:37:04,213
Rosa... Oh, God!

1149
01:37:08,415 --> 01:37:10,371
I'm sorry.

1150
01:37:11,295 --> 01:37:13,251
I don't know why you did it.

1151
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,851
I'd do it too, if I knew how.

1152
01:37:18,695 --> 01:37:22,085
I just don't know how.

1153
01:37:28,575 --> 01:37:30,725
I have to... I have to find a way.

1154
01:37:31,415 --> 01:37:33,645
Is anyone there?

1155
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:36,331
What?

1156
01:37:36,735 --> 01:37:38,691
There was a noise in there!

1157
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:43,211
All right, I'm...

1158
01:37:43,335 --> 01:37:45,291
I'm coming.

1159
01:37:48,935 --> 01:37:50,891
I have to go.

1160
01:37:51,935 --> 01:37:55,291
I have to go, sweetheart, baby.
Somebody's calling me.

1161
01:38:00,535 --> 01:38:02,491
Well? ls anyone there?

1162
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:05,331
Yeah. I'm coming.

1163
01:38:08,575 --> 01:38:10,566
Here he is. Hurry up!

1164
01:38:11,335 --> 01:38:13,291
Wake up!

1165
01:38:13,415 --> 01:38:16,009
- Open up! Open up!
- It's four in the morning.

1166
01:38:16,135 --> 01:38:18,126
I need room four for a while.

1167
01:38:19,535 --> 01:38:22,129
Half an hour? Yes, that'll do.

1168
01:38:22,255 --> 01:38:23,847
Yes, half an hour.

1169
01:38:23,975 --> 01:38:26,443
- We're full.
- That's not true.

1170
01:38:26,575 --> 01:38:29,294
When you're full, you put a sign outside.

1171
01:38:29,415 --> 01:38:31,167
I know the hotel.

1172
01:38:31,295 --> 01:38:34,446
I'm sick of arguing out on the street.

1173
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:36,452
Call the owner.

1174
01:38:36,575 --> 01:38:40,090
What are you waiting for?
The owner has never made a fuss.

1175
01:38:40,215 --> 01:38:42,490
Rosa and I are old friends.

1176
01:38:43,735 --> 01:38:45,691
Open up.

1177
01:38:52,215 --> 01:38:54,729
Don't make any trouble
or I'll tell your boss.

1178
01:38:54,855 --> 01:38:56,811
Come in, it's all sorted...

1179
01:39:00,855 --> 01:39:02,811
You've won. He's taken off.

1180
01:39:03,815 --> 01:39:05,771
I'm very sorry.

1181
01:39:05,895 --> 01:39:08,614
Hurry up! He can't be far away.

1182
01:39:11,495 --> 01:39:15,329
Make him come back.
Tell him he can't just walk off.

1183
01:39:58,015 --> 01:40:00,848
Oh,... please don't tell her you found me.

1184
01:40:00,975 --> 01:40:03,569
I don't fancy it any more.
Did you see her face?

1185
01:40:03,695 --> 01:40:05,651
Once, my wife satisfied me.

1186
01:40:05,775 --> 01:40:08,767
But now she's got a skin disease.
It's like snakeskin.

1187
01:40:08,895 --> 01:40:12,171
- Put yourself in my place.
- Come. Come with me.

1188
01:40:12,295 --> 01:40:14,525
But... Let go of me!

1189
01:40:17,815 --> 01:40:19,134
You're crazy!

1190
01:40:20,215 --> 01:40:23,093
Let go of me! Let go!

1191
01:40:24,575 --> 01:40:27,248
Get the fuck out of here!

1192
01:40:28,495 --> 01:40:30,451
Faggot!

1193
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:12,233
No!

1194
01:41:58,077 --> 01:42:01,433
Try and remember!
The man from the fourth floor.

1195
01:42:01,557 --> 01:42:03,513
He moved in a few days ago.

1196
01:42:03,637 --> 01:42:05,787
I told you, I don't know anyone.

1197
01:42:05,917 --> 01:42:09,705
They come and go. The man on
the fourth, the woman on the first.

1198
01:42:09,837 --> 01:42:11,793
What do I know?

1199
01:42:14,517 --> 01:42:17,270
Where did they take the furniture to?
It's empty.

1200
01:42:17,397 --> 01:42:20,309
Where do you send his mail?
Give me his address.

1201
01:42:20,437 --> 01:42:22,189
I don't have it.

1202
01:42:24,837 --> 01:42:26,793
I don't know these people.

1203
01:42:27,437 --> 01:42:29,871
- Not even his name?
- Nothing!

1204
01:42:31,757 --> 01:42:33,509
Mam'zelle!

1205
01:42:43,877 --> 01:42:45,833
I've found a flat for us.

1206
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:49,033
1, rue Jules Verne.

1207
01:42:50,357 --> 01:42:52,313
Yes. In Passy.

1208
01:42:54,077 --> 01:42:57,228
Come quickly! You'll come now?

1209
01:42:58,397 --> 01:43:00,353
Do you know where it is?

1210
01:43:01,357 --> 01:43:03,348
I'll wait for you. Come over.

1211
01:43:25,178 --> 01:43:27,134
Come in, it's open.

1212
01:43:29,178 --> 01:43:31,134
Do you like our flat?

1213
01:43:31,498 --> 01:43:33,454
It's very light.

1214
01:43:33,578 --> 01:43:36,775
There's a tiny room, too.
It's too small for a double bed.

1215
01:43:37,338 --> 01:43:39,294
It would be fine for a child.

1216
01:43:39,418 --> 01:43:41,648
Fidel. That's a nice name for a boy.

1217
01:43:41,778 --> 01:43:43,734
Fidel, as in Castro.

1218
01:43:43,858 --> 01:43:45,894
But I'd like a girl, too.

1219
01:43:46,018 --> 01:43:48,532
Rosa. As in Rosa Luxemburg.

1220
01:43:48,658 --> 01:43:50,933
Less famous, but I like it.

1221
01:43:51,938 --> 01:43:53,894
You know,

1222
01:43:54,578 --> 01:43:56,808
I wanted to film you every day.

1223
01:43:57,178 --> 01:43:59,453
In the morning, when you wake up,

1224
01:43:59,578 --> 01:44:01,933
in the evening, when you sleep.

1225
01:44:02,058 --> 01:44:04,014
When you first smile,

1226
01:44:05,978 --> 01:44:08,128
and I didn't film any of that.

1227
01:44:08,938 --> 01:44:10,894
Here.

1228
01:44:14,298 --> 01:44:16,448
Today is the last day of shooting.

1229
01:44:16,578 --> 01:44:18,534
The film is finished.

1230
01:44:18,658 --> 01:44:21,570
I don't like things that finish,
things that end.

1231
01:44:21,698 --> 01:44:24,292
You have to start
something else right away.

1232
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:31,094
This flat is huge!

1233
01:44:31,218 --> 01:44:33,174
- Where are you?
- I'm here!

1234
01:44:33,298 --> 01:44:37,007
- It's too big! We'll get lost!
- Stop it! Don't start!

1235
01:44:37,138 --> 01:44:40,175
- How did you find this flat?
- By chance.

1236
01:44:40,298 --> 01:44:43,210
- We'll change everything!
- Everything!

1237
01:44:43,338 --> 01:44:45,249
We'll change chance to destiny.

1238
01:44:45,378 --> 01:44:47,255
Go on, Jeanne. Take off!

1239
01:44:47,378 --> 01:44:50,529
Fly away, you're in heaven!

1240
01:44:50,658 --> 01:44:52,649
You're soaring, you're in heaven!

1241
01:44:52,778 --> 01:44:55,167
Come down, take a nose dive,
come down!

1242
01:44:57,098 --> 01:44:59,168
Make three turns, come down.

1243
01:44:59,338 --> 01:45:02,808
Jeanne, what's happening?
There's an air pocket.

1244
01:45:02,938 --> 01:45:04,894
What's happening?

1245
01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:09,688
The patches of turbulence are over.

1246
01:45:10,938 --> 01:45:13,657
We can't play like children
any more, Jeanne.

1247
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:20,052
- We're adults.
- Adults? That's awful!

1248
01:45:20,858 --> 01:45:22,814
Yes. It's awful.

1249
01:45:24,978 --> 01:45:26,934
What do adults do?

1250
01:45:27,058 --> 01:45:29,014
I don't know.

1251
01:45:29,138 --> 01:45:32,494
We'll have to invent
the gestures and the words.

1252
01:45:32,858 --> 01:45:34,814
For example, adults...

1253
01:45:41,778 --> 01:45:43,928
But there's one thing I do know.

1254
01:45:44,058 --> 01:45:47,050
Adults are calm, serious,

1255
01:45:47,178 --> 01:45:50,136
Iogical, measured, level-headed.

1256
01:45:50,258 --> 01:45:51,407
Yes.

1257
01:45:51,538 --> 01:45:54,894
- And... they face up to problems.
- Yes, yes. Yes, yes.

1258
01:45:55,018 --> 01:45:58,135
You see, Jeanne,
this flat won't work for us.

1259
01:45:58,258 --> 01:46:01,011
This flat, it won't work for us, Jeanne.

1260
01:46:01,538 --> 01:46:04,132
- Where are you going?
- To look for a flat.

1261
01:46:04,298 --> 01:46:06,254
What kind of flat?

1262
01:46:06,378 --> 01:46:08,334
A flat we can live in.

1263
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:10,414
We can live here.

1264
01:46:10,538 --> 01:46:13,450
It's squalid. It smells. It makes me sick.

1265
01:46:13,578 --> 01:46:15,534
- Are you coming with me?
- No, no.

1266
01:46:15,658 --> 01:46:19,731
I've got to close the windows
and return the key. There's a lot to do.

1267
01:46:24,658 --> 01:46:26,614
OK.

1268
01:46:26,738 --> 01:46:28,694
- Bye.
- Bye.

1269
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:33,307
It's me again.

1270
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:36,346
It's over. It's over.

1271
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:38,700
It's over, then it begins again.

1272
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:42,584
What begins again?
I don't understand anything any more.

1273
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:45,668
There's nothing to understand.
We left the apartment.

1274
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:48,429
Now we begin again
with love and all the rest of it.

1275
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:50,506
- The rest?
- Yeah, listen.

1276
01:47:51,190 --> 01:47:53,146
I'm 45.

1277
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:57,104
I'm a widower.
I've got a little hotel, a kind of a dump.

1278
01:47:57,230 --> 01:47:59,790
But it's not completely a flophouse.

1279
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:03,539
And... I used to live on my luck,
and I got married.

1280
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:06,265
My wife killed herself.

1281
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:08,346
But you know, what the hell.

1282
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:10,700
I'm... no prize.

1283
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:13,503
I picked up a nail
when I was in Cuba in 1948

1284
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:16,861
and now I got a prostate
like an Idaho potato.

1285
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:20,949
But I'm still a good stick man,
even if l can't have any children.

1286
01:48:21,950 --> 01:48:23,747
Let's see.

1287
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:27,829
I don't have any stomping grounds.
I don't have any friends.

1288
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:31,065
I suppose if I hadn't met you,

1289
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:34,626
I'd probably settle
for a hard chair and a hemorrhoid.

1290
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:37,662
Anyway, to make a long,
dull story even duller,

1291
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:42,102
I come from a time when a guy like me
would drop into a joint like this

1292
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:46,269
and pick up a young chick like you...
and call her a bimbo.

1293
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:56,226
I'm awfully sorry to intrude

1294
01:48:56,350 --> 01:48:58,705
but I was so struck with your beauty

1295
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:01,822
that I thought I could offer you
a glass of champagne.

1296
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:03,827
Is this seat taken?

1297
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:06,225
- No.
- May l?

1298
01:49:06,350 --> 01:49:08,306
If you'd like to.

1299
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:15,546
Garcon!

1300
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:19,589
You know, the tango is a rite.

1301
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:22,506
Do you understand "rite"?

1302
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:25,190
And you must watch
the legs of the dancers.

1303
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:56,106
Oh, no!

1304
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:58,983
You haven't drunk your champagne
because it was warm.

1305
01:49:59,110 --> 01:50:02,944
And then I ordered you a Scotch
and you haven't drunk your Scotch.

1306
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:16,505
Come on. Just a sip for Daddy.

1307
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:23,188
Now, if you love me, you'll drink all of it.

1308
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:25,266
OK, I love you.

1309
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:27,182
Bravo!

1310
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:29,266
Tell me about your wife.

1311
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:38,466
Let's talk about us.

1312
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:41,227
OK.

1313
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:43,341
But this place is so pitiful.

1314
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:46,346
Yes, but I'm here, aren't l?

1315
01:50:48,070 --> 01:50:50,026
Monsieur Maitre d'Hôtel.

1316
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:53,186
That's rather nasty.

1317
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:56,060
Anyway, you dummy, I love you.

1318
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:59,266
And I want to live with you.

1319
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:01,506
In your flophouse?

1320
01:51:04,630 --> 01:51:07,269
In my flophouse.
What the hell does that mean?

1321
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:09,984
What the hell difference does it make

1322
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:12,578
if I have a flophouse
or a hotel or a castle?

1323
01:51:12,710 --> 01:51:14,940
I love you.
What the fuck does it matter?!

1324
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:39,226
The jury has chosen

1325
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:41,784
the following ten best couples:

1326
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:43,502
No.3!

1327
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:45,109
7!

1328
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:47,664
8,... 9,

1329
01:51:47,790 --> 01:51:50,429
11,... 12,

1330
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:52,506
13,... 14,

1331
01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:54,706
15... and 19!

1332
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:59,466
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
good luck for the last tango!

1333
01:52:14,956 --> 01:52:16,912
Give me some more whisky.

1334
01:52:17,556 --> 01:52:19,990
Oh, I thought you weren't drinking.

1335
01:52:20,116 --> 01:52:23,028
But I'm thirsty now
and I want some more drink.

1336
01:52:23,156 --> 01:52:26,307
All right.
I think that's a good idea.

1337
01:52:26,436 --> 01:52:28,392
Wait a minute.

1338
01:52:28,836 --> 01:52:32,670
Because you're really beautiful.
Wait a minute.

1339
01:52:33,476 --> 01:52:35,432
I'm sorry.

1340
01:52:36,076 --> 01:52:40,115
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to spill my drink.

1341
01:52:43,716 --> 01:52:45,672
Let's have a toast

1342
01:52:45,796 --> 01:52:47,752
to our life in the hotel.

1343
01:52:47,876 --> 01:52:50,071
No! Fuck all that! Come on.

1344
01:52:50,196 --> 01:52:52,152
Hey, listen.

1345
01:52:52,276 --> 01:52:55,712
Let's drink a toast
to our life in the country. Huh?

1346
01:52:55,836 --> 01:52:58,396
You're a nature lover?
You didn't tell me.

1347
01:52:58,516 --> 01:53:00,472
Oh, for Chr... I'm a nature boy.

1348
01:53:00,596 --> 01:53:03,952
Can't you see me with the cows
and the chickenshit all over me?

1349
01:53:04,076 --> 01:53:05,828
Oh, yeah.

1350
01:53:05,956 --> 01:53:08,390
- To the house of the cows.
- Cows.

1351
01:53:08,516 --> 01:53:10,472
I will be your cow, too.

1352
01:53:12,196 --> 01:53:14,152
And listen...

1353
01:53:14,276 --> 01:53:16,232
I get to milk you twice a day.

1354
01:53:16,756 --> 01:53:19,907
- How about that?
- I hate the country.

1355
01:53:20,036 --> 01:53:23,153
- You hate the country?
- I hate it!

1356
01:53:23,276 --> 01:53:25,232
I prefer to go to the hotel.

1357
01:53:25,356 --> 01:53:27,472
- Come on, let's go...
- No. Let's dance.

1358
01:53:30,464 --> 01:53:32,694
Come on. Don't you wanna dance?

1359
01:53:37,704 --> 01:53:39,660
We can start again.

1360
01:54:39,464 --> 01:54:41,819
That's the limit!
What are you doing?

1361
01:54:41,944 --> 01:54:43,821
You'll have to leave, sir.

1362
01:54:43,944 --> 01:54:46,777
Madame! 'Tis ever love.

1363
01:54:46,904 --> 01:54:49,134
Go to the circus if you want to see love!

1364
01:54:49,264 --> 01:54:51,220
Go on! Get out of here!

1365
01:54:51,344 --> 01:54:53,300
You'll have to leave.

1366
01:55:01,864 --> 01:55:03,820
Kiss me, sweetheart!

1367
01:55:03,944 --> 01:55:07,334
Farewell, you sweet peach blossom.

1368
01:55:12,824 --> 01:55:15,782
I could dance for ever.
Oh, my hemorrhoid!

1369
01:55:20,264 --> 01:55:22,380
Beauty of mine, sit before me.

1370
01:55:22,504 --> 01:55:26,543
Let me peruse you
and remember you always like this.

1371
01:55:31,824 --> 01:55:33,780
Garcon! Champagne!

1372
01:55:34,424 --> 01:55:37,416
If music be the food of love, play on.

1373
01:55:37,984 --> 01:55:39,940
What's the matter with you?

1374
01:55:40,064 --> 01:55:42,020
It's finished.

1375
01:55:42,144 --> 01:55:44,100
What's the matter with you?

1376
01:55:44,224 --> 01:55:47,819
- It's finished!
- What's finished?

1377
01:55:47,944 --> 01:55:50,663
We're never going
to see each other again. Never!

1378
01:55:50,784 --> 01:55:52,740
That's ridiculous.

1379
01:55:54,224 --> 01:55:56,738
- That's ridiculous!
- It's not a joke.

1380
01:55:57,264 --> 01:56:00,540
- Oh, you dirty rat!
- It's finished.

1381
01:56:01,064 --> 01:56:04,534
Look, when something's finished,
it begins again.

1382
01:56:05,584 --> 01:56:07,540
I'm getting married!

1383
01:56:07,664 --> 01:56:09,620
I'm going away.

1384
01:56:09,744 --> 01:56:11,700
It's finished.

1385
01:56:12,144 --> 01:56:14,100
Oh, Jesus.

1386
01:56:15,664 --> 01:56:19,213
Listen, that's not a subway strap,
that's me cock!

1387
01:56:19,504 --> 01:56:21,460
It's finished!

1388
01:56:25,864 --> 01:56:27,661
Jesus!

1389
01:56:57,344 --> 01:56:59,096
Wait a minute!

1390
01:57:00,224 --> 01:57:02,180
You dumb bimbo!

1391
01:57:03,064 --> 01:57:05,339
Shit! Wait a minute. Goddamn it!

1392
01:57:06,344 --> 01:57:08,300
Hey!

1393
01:57:11,304 --> 01:57:13,818
Hey, rube! Come here!

1394
01:57:14,984 --> 01:57:16,940
Come here!

1395
01:57:19,264 --> 01:57:21,220
Come here!

1396
01:57:23,784 --> 01:57:25,740
I'm gonna get you!

1397
01:57:26,344 --> 01:57:27,572
Bimbo!

1398
01:58:02,353 --> 01:58:04,309
Stop! Stop!

1399
01:58:04,433 --> 01:58:05,866
Hold it!

1400
01:58:05,993 --> 01:58:07,551
It's over.

1401
01:58:07,673 --> 01:58:08,867
Hey, cool it!

1402
01:58:08,993 --> 01:58:10,745
Stop it! We're finished.

1403
01:58:12,993 --> 01:58:16,144
Go away! Go away! Go away!

1404
01:58:16,353 --> 01:58:18,309
Go away!

1405
01:58:19,633 --> 01:58:21,589
I can't win.

1406
01:58:22,313 --> 01:58:24,269
Give me a break!

1407
01:58:29,233 --> 01:58:31,428
I'll call the police!

1408
01:58:31,553 --> 01:58:34,351
Aha! I smell the henhouse.

1409
01:58:36,153 --> 01:58:38,303
Well, shit, I'm not in your way.

1410
01:58:38,433 --> 01:58:40,344
After you, mademoiselle!

1411
01:58:43,393 --> 01:58:46,749
So long, sister.
Besides, you're a crummy-looking broad.

1412
01:58:47,913 --> 01:58:50,871
I don't give a damn
if I never see you again.

1413
01:58:52,153 --> 01:58:54,109
Shit.

1414
01:59:10,153 --> 01:59:11,825
It's over!

1415
01:59:11,953 --> 01:59:13,909
It's over!

1416
01:59:14,033 --> 01:59:15,830
Oh, fuck the police.

1417
01:59:15,953 --> 01:59:17,181
It's over!

1418
01:59:17,313 --> 01:59:19,304
Listen, I want to talk to you.

1419
01:59:29,673 --> 01:59:31,504
Help!

1420
01:59:31,633 --> 01:59:35,546
Help! Help!

1421
01:59:37,313 --> 01:59:39,429
Please, help!

1422
01:59:39,553 --> 01:59:42,545
Help! Help!

1423
01:59:53,233 --> 01:59:55,189
Oh, man!

1424
02:00:04,193 --> 02:00:07,469
Help! Help me!

1425
02:00:08,873 --> 02:00:10,829
Help!

1426
02:00:11,313 --> 02:00:13,304
This is getting ridiculous.

1427
02:00:23,389 --> 02:00:25,300
It's the title shot, baby.

1428
02:00:25,429 --> 02:00:27,385
We're going all the way.

1429
02:00:36,269 --> 02:00:38,305
It's a little old,

1430
02:00:38,429 --> 02:00:40,624
but full of memories?

1431
02:00:51,069 --> 02:00:53,025
Mademoiselle...

1432
02:00:56,949 --> 02:00:58,905
How do you like your hero?

1433
02:00:59,749 --> 02:01:01,705
Over easy or sunny-side up?

1434
02:01:08,029 --> 02:01:10,463
You ran through Africa and Asia

1435
02:01:11,549 --> 02:01:13,505
and Indonesia.

1436
02:01:14,309 --> 02:01:16,265
And now I've found you.

1437
02:01:18,149 --> 02:01:20,105
And I love you.

1438
02:01:23,309 --> 02:01:25,265
I wanna know your name.

1439
02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:28,668
Jeanne.

1440
02:01:33,829 --> 02:01:35,785
Our children.

1441
02:01:36,789 --> 02:01:38,745
Our children.

1442
02:01:41,829 --> 02:01:43,785
Our children...

1443
02:01:48,909 --> 02:01:50,865
will remember.

1444
02:03:15,549 --> 02:03:17,505
I don't know who he is.

1445
02:03:18,989 --> 02:03:20,980
He followed me in the street.

1446
02:03:21,629 --> 02:03:24,063
He tried to rape me. He's a lunatic.

1447
02:03:25,029 --> 02:03:27,099
I don't know what he's called.

1448
02:03:28,069 --> 02:03:30,025
I don't know his name.

1449
02:03:30,149 --> 02:03:32,185
I don't know who he is.

1450
02:03:32,309 --> 02:03:34,300
He tried to rape me.

1451
02:03:34,429 --> 02:03:36,465
I don't know.

1452
02:03:36,789 --> 02:03:38,745
I don't know him.

1453
02:03:40,989 --> 02:03:42,945
I don't know who he is.

1454
02:03:44,869 --> 02:03:46,825
