00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:08,725
(Episode 17, Destiny Changes)

2
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:39,055
We almost got wet.

3
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:41,025
It's coming. The wave's coming.

4
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:42,390
It is?

5
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:43,990
- Go in. - Wait.

6
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:46,065
- Go in. - Wait. Don't push.

7
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,035
Are you okay?

8
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:55,930
Forget this.

9
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,170
- What? - Come.

10
00:00:57,174 --> 00:00:59,445
- No. - Come here.

11
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:01,785
No. No!

12
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:05,215
Let's just stay here.

13
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,690
I'll be right back.

14
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:58,920
No. Don't go.

15
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,205
Stay right here. Okay?

16
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,255
Black Korando, license plate number 56T3275.

17
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:55,850
He just went on road 125.

18
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:57,055
Make a U-turn.

19
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:16,505
The mistake made by the deity...

20
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:19,745
changed the destinies...

21
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,045
of all humans.

22
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:25,715
If the banker Song Hyun Chul...

23
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:29,585
had died as predestined,

24
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:32,455
and the other Song Hyun Chul...

25
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,465
didn't enter his body and bring him back to life,

26
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,295
the crime wouldn't have been discovered,

27
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,165
but it has now.

28
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,105
And that was...

29
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,175
just the beginning.

30
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:17,105
That jerk.

31
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,605
Get closer. Closer!

32
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,555
Song Hyun Chul!

33
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,855
Hye Jin.

34
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,440
She was pretty.

35
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:40,510
How could he fire her on her first day here?

36
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:41,785
What are you talking about?

37
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,720
Ms. Yang. The branch vice manager.

38
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,250
Mr. Song kicked her out just because...

39
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:47,090
she was sent here through nepotism.

40
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,750
That's up to HR.

41
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:50,820
He's out of control. He doesn't care.

42
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,320
He's so self-centered.

43
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,460
You're only sad because Ms. Yang was pretty.

44
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,665
Naturally.

45
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,100
Why else would I be sad?

46
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,605
We don't need the help. You can do all the work.

47
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:03,270
You and your wife get along well.

48
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:04,700
You talk on the phone every day.

49
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,400
Do you still get happy when you see pretty women?

50
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:08,270
How is one related to the other?

51
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,485
They aren't related at all.

52
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,710
- This is delicious. - This is why...

53
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,650
I can't get married.

54
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,880
- I can't trust men. - That's right.

55
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,865
Like women can be trusted? They're the same.

56
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:23,020
I noticed from before,

57
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,595
but you have an odd complex toward women.

58
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,105
You were dumped badly, weren't you?

59
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,060
What do you mean?

60
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:33,770
You're not my type. That's why I'm not nice to you.

61
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,415
I have a very positive attitude toward women.

62
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:41,545
He may be a bit dumb, but he has a sharp tongue.

63
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:43,415
I get hurt sometimes too.

64
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:47,555
I am nice only to people that I really like.

65
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,295
What are you doing?

66
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,295
Thank you for lunch.

67
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:14,285
Why are you being so gross?

68
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:16,045
Sleep in your room.

69
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,155
No. I'm going to sleep with you tonight.

70
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,465
- Mom. - Yes?

71
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:30,820
I'm going to be your daughter...

72
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:33,035
in my next life too.

73
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:38,505
I guess I am a pretty good mom.

74
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,445
That's not it.

75
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,545
Go to sleep.

76
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,255
- Mom. - Yes?

77
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:56,555
Is there anything you regret...

78
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,195
when you think about Dad?

79
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:12,535
That day.

80
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:15,170
That day?

81
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,340
The day he ran out of the kitchen...

82
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,445
to go to FSS to find out...

83
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:22,585
what happened with that loan.

84
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,885
For not stopping him.

85
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,155
If I had stopped him then,

86
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,025
he wouldn't have gotten into that accident,

87
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,695
and this never would've happened either.

88
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,875
I regret that day the most.

89
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,630
Smile.

90
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:21,245
1, 2, 3.

91
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:25,300
Would you take one more please?

92
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:26,545
- One more? - Yes.

93
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:29,945
1, 2, 3.

94
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,585
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

95
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,835
You don't use ketchup on sushi?

96
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:46,635
Are you teasing me?

97
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,565
You got me.

98
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,635
Let's go on trips often from now on.

99
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,245
Think about where you want to go next.

100
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:59,645
- I know already. - Where?

101
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,240
- Chuncheon. - Chuncheon?

102
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,515
Yes.

103
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:08,055
I went to there alone on our 10-year anniversary.

104
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:11,750
I forgot Nami Island, so I wanted to go back.

105
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,125
Let's go then.

106
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,295
We can go for our anniversary this year...

107
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,205
I'm fine.

108
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:27,545
You told me not to think about it rationally.

109
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,245
Let's just...

110
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,945
accept what's in front of us.

111
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,155
Okay?

112
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:42,825
Eat up.

113
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,265
You really don't need ketchup?

114
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,700
I'm off to school.

115
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,175
Okay.

116
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,145
Have a nice day at school.

117
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,775
Don't fall asleep, and study hard.

118
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,245
Okay.

119
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:24,495
Father. Aren't you going to dance school anymore?

120
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:29,590
- Yun Hwa. - Yes?

121
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,905
Well,

122
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:34,275
I don't know how to face you.

123
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:39,275
After I sent my son off like that, I wonder...

124
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,370
if it's okay for me to live here with you...

125
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:43,645
shamelessly like this.

126
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,255
So what?

127
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,085
You want to live there?

128
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,025
Father.

129
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,795
You may be Hyun Chul's father,

130
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,795
but you're also Ji Soo's grandpa.

131
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:04,700
It's just that Ji Soo's dad is gone...

132
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,545
from the relationship that he, Ji Soo,

133
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:10,145
you, and I created.

134
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:13,645
Don't think that way.

135
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:16,545
You and I...

136
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:20,115
have our own past that we've shared too.

137
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,555
Let's cling onto that.

138
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,295
Happily and for a long time.

139
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,765
Hearing you say that...

140
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:40,645
makes me feel sorrier and more grateful.

141
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:48,515
He has to call someone "Mother"...

142
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,155
although she didn't give birth to him.

143
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,055
That's how...

144
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:57,825
our fates are right now.

145
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:00,825
Let's be cool about this.

146
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:24,385
They were happy.

147
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,385
No one knew what fate awaited them.

148
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:31,925
Neither the deities...

149
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,695
nor they knew...

150
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,065
what would happen.

151
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,535
He's here.

152
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:44,800
- Woo Jang Choon. - Woo Jang Choon.

153
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,405
With the death of the banker Song Hyun Chul,

154
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:49,775
the truth that would've been buried...

155
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,145
came to light.

156
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:54,885
The deity's mistake...

157
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:57,555
ended up being fortuitous.

158
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,255
However...

159
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,820
Hey. Are you dating that phone?

160
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,795
You've been staring at it like crazy.

161
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:11,895
Whose call are you waiting for?

162
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,960
- Nobody. - That's right.

163
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,930
The forum members are meeting this weekend.

164
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:17,165
You'll all go, right?

165
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,700
- I can't. - To study again?

166
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:21,745
You traitor.

167
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,875
I have plans with my dad.

168
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,675
We're going to a bath house.

169
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,415
Someone...

170
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,915
had to be the sacrifice and face...

171
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,285
the sadness resulting from that mistake.

172
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:47,665
You'll be so pretty once the swelling goes down.

173
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,035
This is a new royal class combination insurance.

174
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,430
It covers not only illnesses and injuries,

175
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:55,970
but if you want a nose job...

176
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:57,415
I already got one.

177
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,840
If you want to fix your entire face...

178
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,045
I did.

179
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:04,385
Anyway, whatever you get done,

180
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:07,315
we guarantee 50 percent of hospital costs.

181
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,125
You should get some work done.

182
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:14,995
Look.

183
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:16,990
You're super ugly, okay?

184
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,665
Seriously. There will be no end with you!

185
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:21,690
You're hopeless.

186
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:22,730
I'm speechless.

187
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,230
What's her problem?

188
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,175
Get a refund! It's a major fail!

189
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:30,145
You can get insurance for your child's salary.

190
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:33,200
You obviously don't worry about your future,

191
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,445
but you never know about your children.

192
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,185
This policy looks nice.

193
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:40,685
How old are your children?

194
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:43,155
My son...

195
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,125
is 50.

196
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:49,090
- Pardon? - And my husband is 83.

197
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,425
In a few years...

198
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,405
That's right. My son will get pension soon.

199
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,835
I... I see...

200
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:01,045
That's how it is.

201
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,585
I thought I had to return her husband to her.

202
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,055
The banker Song Hyun Chul...

203
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,525
died as he was destined,

204
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:24,065
and the one who came back to life...

205
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,935
only borrowed his body.

206
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:30,765
Since the soul inside was her husband.

207
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:33,135
So I thought it was only natural...

208
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:35,305
for him to return to her.

209
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,115
I told you to come only if I called.

210
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,625
You seriously don't listen.

211
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,525
Hey.

212
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,865
Will you be okay without me?

213
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,095
Why? Are you going somewhere?

214
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:58,290
I think I'll have to.

215
00:17:58,294 --> 00:17:59,635
Where to?

216
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,390
Somewhere far away.

217
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:04,605
Do you have a passport? You don't even have an ID.

218
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,345
Hey.

219
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:11,345
What's your wish?

220
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:14,015
Why are you asking? It's not like you'll grant it.

221
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:17,170
I'll grant you your wish before I go.

222
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,415
Tell me anything you want.

223
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,250
What are you, really?

224
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:25,555
Are you a magician?

225
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:29,225
Tell me your wish. I'll grant it.

226
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,465
Insurance Queen. Okay?

227
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,005
Take care of yourself, okay?

228
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,075
You take care of yourself.

229
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,095
Sorry.

230
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:23,045
However, her husband...

231
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,685
was no longer the same Song Hyun Chul.

232
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,755
Of course,

233
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:31,295
he wasn't the banker Song Hyun Chul either.

234
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,295
He...

235
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,995
was a brand new person entirely...

236
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:39,965
ever since the memories...

237
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,865
within the banker's brain started to surface.

238
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,505
Because memories...

239
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,645
aren't simple records of time,

240
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:52,675
but accompany the emotions of each moment.

241
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:54,845
That...

242
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,845
was a shocking result...

243
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,115
that we couldn't predict.

244
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,825
It's so dramatic.

245
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,395
One Song Hyun Chul helped solve the case...

246
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:07,495
for another Song Hyun Chul.

247
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,290
If Manhojang's Song Hyun Chul...

248
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,360
hadn't gone to your bank...

249
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,860
to request a loan,

250
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:15,990
this crime would never have been uncovered.

251
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:17,935
You're probably right.

252
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,045
(CCTV footage of reporter planting a bug.)

253
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:26,300
You must be relieved.

254
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,340
Your case is closed.

255
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,385
Then let's control the traffic properly now.

256
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,985
But you know,

257
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:32,780
something still nags at me.

258
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:33,910
What nags at you now?

259
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,250
The banker Song Hyun Chul...

260
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:37,480
and Manhojang's Song Hyun Chul.

261
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,295
The relationship between them.

262
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:41,595
I really don't get it.

263
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,535
They got into accidents at the same time...

264
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:52,705
Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going?

265
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,275
It's true.

266
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,275
He woke up during his funeral.

267
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:01,015
The entire hospital was in panic mode.

268
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,140
How could that...

269
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:03,370
It's incredible enough...

270
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:04,840
that he woke up during the funeral,

271
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,355
but his state...

272
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:08,225
He was totally fine.

273
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,555
You would never guess that he had died.

274
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:27,205
I'll cooperate.

275
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,545
I will uncover the truth.

276
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:37,110
Why did you give someone with bad credit a loan?

277
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:38,840
He's a veteran,

278
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:40,715
so I lowered his interest rate too.

279
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:42,680
The savings bank...

280
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:44,750
is flipping out about the law on loans.

281
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:47,080
The restrictions are too burdensome for us.

282
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:49,150
Then we should adjust our rates...

283
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:50,820
to counter the effect. Prepare a proposal.

284
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,390
Okay, I'll get to it right away.

285
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,535
Mr. Ha. Did you send the performance report?

286
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,860
I'm about to.

287
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:57,975
Send it right away. It should be processed.

288
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,775
Hello.

289
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,905
Hi. What brings you here?

290
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:05,170
The case is going well thanks to you.

291
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:07,270
I wanted to stop by to thank you.

292
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:09,515
I heard you went in to testify.

293
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:10,815
I did.

294
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:17,310
I remember...

295
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,195
the first time I met you in this office.

296
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:24,535
You were upset about the late Song Hyun Chul...

297
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,035
as if it happened to you.

298
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:28,705
And you eventually resolved it for me.

299
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:31,505
You did a great job as well.

300
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:34,775
But...

301
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:37,105
there's something I still haven't figured out.

302
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,575
What is your relationship...

303
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:41,845
with the late Song Hyun Chul?

304
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:44,985
Why did you say you were friends...

305
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,015
when you weren't?

306
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:50,750
You have the same name,

307
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:52,350
and the same date of birth.

308
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:55,090
When he first came here to get a loan,

309
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,235
he found out he had a loan that he never took out.

310
00:22:58,527 --> 00:22:59,735
That's why...

311
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:01,865
you began investigating.

312
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,805
Yes, that's correct.

313
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,835
Mr. Song Hyun Chul.

314
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,045
What is your relationship...

315
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:10,145
with Manhojang's Song Hyun Chul?

316
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,885
Ji Soo?

317
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:27,095
Don't you know me?

318
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:31,125
You're a detective.

319
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,535
That's right.

320
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:35,265
But why are you here?

321
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,035
I came to see my dad.

322
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:39,835
Your dad?

323
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,375
Yes.

324
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,375
Dad?

325
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,185
Yes?

326
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,995
Ji Soo. What brings you here?

327
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,395
Come in.

328
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:17,745
Can't you use this?

329
00:24:20,843 --> 00:24:23,285
It was your phone.

330
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,280
I just wish there was at least one thing...

331
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:29,585
that would stay the same about you.

332
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,775
Ji Soo.

333
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,475
I can't...

334
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:52,445
go back to how things were.

335
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,645
Now, I...

336
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:58,555
am not a cook who uses a wok.

337
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,215
I'm a banker.

338
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:04,455
Yes, I'm definitely Song Ji Soo's dad.

339
00:25:05,454 --> 00:25:06,795
But...

340
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,365
I can't go back...

341
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:13,965
to how things were as you want.

342
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,305
I shouldn't either.

343
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:18,975
You're so mean.

344
00:25:21,803 --> 00:25:24,145
Ji Soo.

345
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,185
Ji Soo.

346
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,135
Stop denying it.

347
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,305
Kwak Hyo Joo told us everything.

348
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:55,945
The 1.3 million dollars you deposited...

349
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:58,075
into Park Min Joo's account was for her.

350
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:01,100
I never did such thing.

351
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:02,545
He's lying.

352
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,070
The depositor, Henry Smith,

353
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,315
is Woo Jang Choon.

354
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,225
He has 9 million dollars in his account.

355
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:11,025
Woo Jang Choon.

356
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,380
We have a certified bank statement too.

357
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:15,765
You're hurting yourself by denying it.

358
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:19,295
Well,

359
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:22,260
do you have proof that Henry Smith...

360
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,030
is me?

361
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:26,160
Kwak Hyo Joo is lying.

362
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,030
Look. What are you trying to pull?

363
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,375
Are you kidding me?

364
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:39,580
Hello, Jaeil Insurance. Jo Yun Hwa speaking.

365
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,310
I'd like to discuss getting a policy.

366
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:42,555
Yes.

367
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:45,525
Yes.

368
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,795
Okay. I'll go see you there.

369
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,835
Okay, thank you.

370
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,735
Hello, Jaeil Insurance. Jo Yun Hwa speaking.

371
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,045
Yes.

372
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:15,555
Yun Hwa. I'm sorry.

373
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:18,325
Take care, okay?

374
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,195
I gave Yun Hwa and Hyun Chul...

375
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:28,305
small miracles before I left.

376
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:32,735
That was the only thing...

377
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,245
I could do for them.

378
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:47,555
Thank you.

379
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,080
- What's her secret? - She's impressive.

380
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,525
How did she do it?

381
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,095
(Jo Yun Hwa)

382
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:00,835
(This month's performance)

383
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:04,465
Thank you.

384
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,505
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

385
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:09,930
- Thanks. - Congratulations.

386
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,875
- Thank you. - Applause.

387
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:17,615
Who's telling the truth?

388
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:20,540
Woo Jang Choon claims he never sent her the money.

389
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:23,185
And Hyo Joo says he's lying.

390
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,955
Neither of them will budge.

391
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:28,295
Then where is the 9 million dollars?

392
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:38,530
Where did you move the 9 million dollars...

393
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,035
from Henry Smith's account?

394
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:43,205
The balance is zero. Zero.

395
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:56,380
What's going on? What's wrong with this?

396
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:57,825
Where's my money?

397
00:28:58,386 --> 00:28:59,855
My money!

398
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,070
- Why? What is it? - What's wrong?

399
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,785
- What is it? - What's going on?

400
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:31,555
Why is this in here?

401
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:35,790
Yes, of course. I will manage your assets.

402
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,125
You can trust me.

403
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,635
You should take care of your health too.

404
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,465
I'll see you on the course this weekend.

405
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:44,875
Okay.

406
00:30:00,415 --> 00:30:01,685
Yes?

407
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:03,750
- Of course, - Mr. Lee.

408
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:06,795
not all miracles came from me.

409
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:10,925
Mr. Song. We did it.

410
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,335
We received an investment of 8 million dollars.

411
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,305
Congratulations.

412
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:17,860
I'm so happy for you.

413
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,530
It's all thanks to you.

414
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:21,530
If you hadn't given us the loan back then,

415
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:23,275
we would've gone bankrupt for sure.

416
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:26,040
I just paid off the loan,

417
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,545
and stopped by to thank you.

418
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:29,845
I'm so glad.

419
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:32,610
I wish you success with your business.

420
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:34,780
And please keep working with Shinhwa Bank.

421
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,850
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

422
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:39,450
Not at all. Congratulations.

423
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:40,895
There were also beautiful miracles...

424
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,865
that the humans created.

425
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,095
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

426
00:30:56,238 --> 00:30:59,545
(Little Brother)

427
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:06,040
The number you have dialed...

428
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,785
is not in service.

429
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:09,785
What's going on?

430
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:17,025
Why don't you move?

431
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,590
There are too many steps here.

432
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:23,865
Your joints aren't good either.

433
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:25,430
It must be difficult to get around.

434
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,305
You should move into an apartment.

435
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:31,345
If it's because of me, don't worry about it.

436
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,840
There's Ji Soo's high school matter too.

437
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:36,045
So I've looked into a place for you.

438
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,115
Hyun Chul, it's okay.

439
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:43,025
- Do as I say. - No.

440
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:45,195
We'll take care of ourselves.

441
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,295
I may be in the situation that I am,

442
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:54,195
but Father, you, and Ji Soo are all my family.

443
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,930
If it gets top difficult, I'll tell you.

444
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,135
Help us then.

445
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,345
Let's move into an apartment.

446
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,085
You're trying to move into Kang Ho's, aren't you?

447
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,910
Ji Soo.

448
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:14,185
He wants to do his part.

449
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,755
He's trying to do it at least with money.

450
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,655
Let's ease his guilt.

451
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:22,625
That's why you let him go. Why are you doing this?

452
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:24,795
If we don't accept it,

453
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,595
he'll feel guilty.

454
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:36,605
Let's move.

455
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:40,375
There's no one to water the yard anymore anyway.

456
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:51,650
All of Jungin Grade School's teachers...

457
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,455
will have their paychecks deposited into our bank.

458
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:57,025
Get Jungin Junior High and High School too.

459
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:58,290
Yes, sir.

460
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:00,590
The company that you mentioned before, Youngho,

461
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,330
did in fact lie about the number of employees,

462
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,890
so we denied their loan.

463
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,060
An owner like that...

464
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,530
probably got his patents dishonestly too.

465
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:08,945
Cut all business with them.

466
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:10,500
Yes, sir.

467
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,770
Thanks to your efforts, our branch...

468
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:14,945
became the top branch nationwide.

469
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:19,815
Are you happy?

470
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:23,080
It's too soon to be happy.

471
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,350
Now, we are our own competition,

472
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:26,795
not other branches.

473
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:30,120
Aim to increase your numbers by 20 percent,

474
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,490
and hit the ground running.

475
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:33,995
If not, you will fall and die.

476
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:35,735
That will be all.

477
00:33:40,735 --> 00:33:42,605
But still, go out for a celebration first.

478
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,545
Thank you.

479
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:48,985
We still get to go out though.

480
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,245
Okay.

481
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:51,745
Where should we go?

482
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:57,385
Is my dad...

483
00:33:57,986 --> 00:33:59,795
living with you guys now?

484
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:03,295
No. Isn't he living with your family?

485
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:05,820
You're not lying, are you?

486
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,635
Why would I lie about that?

487
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,635
Ji Soo.

488
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,560
To be honest, my dad...

489
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,135
He's my dad.

490
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,405
The body is my dad and the soul is your dad.

491
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,440
Strictly put, he's more of my dad.

492
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:20,700
That's not right.

493
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,640
What if I'm in your body?

494
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,840
That would be me, not you.

495
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,045
It would be me.

496
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:27,680
- The body matters. - The mind matters.

497
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:28,850
The body is just a shell.

498
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,780
Where would you keep your mind without a shell?

499
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:32,450
- What? - Without my dad's body,

500
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:33,850
where could your dad have gone in?

501
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:35,550
He could've gone into another body.

502
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:38,425
Then he'd be that person, not your dad.

503
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:40,120
Just because his soul is your dad,

504
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:42,160
you can't insist that he's your dad.

505
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,435
Hey. Say you asked for a bowl of rice.

506
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:48,430
Are you asking for the rice or the bowl?

507
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,430
What matters? The rice or the bowl?

508
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:51,530
People aren't rice.

509
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,775
Answer the question, you idiot.

510
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:56,315
You're impossible to talk to.

511
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,315
You're so ignorant.

512
00:34:58,746 --> 00:34:59,740
Let's go.

513
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:01,585
What? Ignorant?

514
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:03,785
Why you...

515
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,920
- That doesn't scare me. - You...

516
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:08,720
- Hey! Hey! - Hey, stop.

517
00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:10,225
I'll kill you today!

518
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:12,095
So...

519
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:14,390
you got into a fight while arguing...

520
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:15,865
about your dads?

521
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:17,830
Call your parents.

522
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:19,430
You're minors,

523
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:20,705
so we can't just let you go.

524
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,005
You kids can go home.

525
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,245
- Okay. - Okay.

526
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:33,615
Excuse me...

527
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:49,105
It's all done. You may take the kids.

528
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:50,635
Thank you.

529
00:35:58,173 --> 00:36:00,300
Kang Ho. Go home first.

530
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:02,585
I'll go after I talk to Ji Soo.

531
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,285
Is that okay, Ji Soo?

532
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:13,295
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

533
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:23,965
Here. Eat.

534
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,075
- Ji Soo. - I'm sorry.

535
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,085
I'll make sure it never happens again.

536
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:39,855
Okay.

537
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,955
Whatever the reason, violence isn't the answer.

538
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:44,555
Of course,

539
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:47,155
Kang Ho probably started it.

540
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:50,025
If you end up hitting someone,

541
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:51,890
you lose your chance to explain yourself...

542
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:53,695
even if the other person was wrong.

543
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:58,735
It's hard for me to sit here...

544
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:02,605
with you.

545
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,245
I know.

546
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,915
I told...

547
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:14,215
Kang Ho...

548
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,385
that he isn't his dad.

549
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,825
I knew how it felt to lose my dead...

550
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:27,435
and how much it hurts,

551
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,035
but I was nasty to him.

552
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:36,905
It was hard, wasn't it?

553
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:39,275
He has a different face...

554
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,445
and a different voice.

555
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,355
My dad didn't dress that way.

556
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:52,625
I didn't believe it at first either.

557
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:55,825
But...

558
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:59,695
he made me believe it.

559
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:02,935
He came to Mom and me...

560
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,605
and made us all believe that he was Dad.

561
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:11,405
If he was going to do this, why did he do that?

562
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:16,645
I hate...

563
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,515
my dad.

564
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,625
It's not something I can understand,

565
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:31,765
but the adults want me to understand.

566
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:39,605
There's nothing I can do...

567
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:42,305
other than to hate him.

568
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:45,200
But Ji Soo...

569
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:46,515
I'm going home.

570
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,315
Sorry about today.

571
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,390
Where are you?

572
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:12,235
Why aren't you answering your phone?

573
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,095
What's going on?

574
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:43,965
Why were you at the police station?

575
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:45,365
It's nothing.

576
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,430
Nothing? How is it nothing?

577
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:50,505
What's the big deal?

578
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:52,070
What do you mean?

579
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:54,075
That's nothing.

580
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:56,810
And why do you keep waiting for people here?

581
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,915
Don't wait for me or Dad.

582
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:01,780
Don't wait for anyone here anymore.

583
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:03,085
It's annoying.

584
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:08,825
What's gotten into you lately? It's upsetting.

585
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,950
You weren't like this even when Dad passed away.

586
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,765
Why are you doing this now?

587
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:00,275
Sorry, Ji Soo.

588
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:05,855
I'm sorry about everything.

589
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,485
Why are you sorry? What did you do wrong?

590
00:41:16,858 --> 00:41:18,825
That's how it is for moms.

591
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:21,965
Even if we didn't do anything wrong,

592
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:25,135
we feel sorry toward our kids.

593
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,985
The photos are crisp.

594
00:41:45,052 --> 00:41:47,850
The angles and ambiance are great.

595
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:49,825
You can be the main photographer.

596
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,565
Do you mean it?

597
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:55,060
Then am I qualified to be an assistant?

598
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,465
Above and beyond.

599
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,235
Gosh, excuse me.

600
00:42:06,474 --> 00:42:07,800
Hello? Where are you?

601
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:09,640
I'll pick up Mother and go.

602
00:42:09,644 --> 00:42:10,845
Okay.

603
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:12,640
I'll head home too.

604
00:42:12,647 --> 00:42:15,240
She said she wanted to eat at home.

605
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,885
You'll get tired.

606
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:19,055
It's okay. You can help.

607
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:20,855
You're a cook.

608
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:25,595
Anyway,

609
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,695
how long will you stay at the residence?

610
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:34,975
Sorry for bringing it up.

611
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:36,430
See you tonight.

612
00:42:36,437 --> 00:42:37,675
Okay.

613
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:41,470
Really?

614
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,840
Really.

615
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:45,140
He said he saved Grandpa at the constructions site,

616
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,740
and you at the stairs.

617
00:42:46,747 --> 00:42:48,380
I don't know what he meant,

618
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:51,125
but he said he fixed Dad's phone and helped him.

619
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:54,655
Mom. Draw his face for me.

620
00:42:55,723 --> 00:42:57,065
I can't draw.

621
00:42:57,358 --> 00:42:59,995
Then I'll draw. Tell me if it's him.

622
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,005
Yes, that's right. This is the face.

623
00:43:11,372 --> 00:43:13,470
You should've told me sooner.

624
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:14,740
Call him again.

625
00:43:14,742 --> 00:43:16,445
He left. I can't reach him.

626
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,355
Why do you think he helped us?

627
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,255
He asked me for a wish.

628
00:43:25,453 --> 00:43:27,395
I should've told him a better wish.

629
00:43:28,923 --> 00:43:31,165
Like introducing me to a hot guy.

630
00:43:34,095 --> 00:43:35,295
Just eat.

631
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,905
I should've asked him out.

632
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:53,410
Hey. It's your father's memorial soon.

633
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:55,910
How should we do the memorial?

634
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:57,285
I'll prepare it.

635
00:43:57,752 --> 00:43:59,125
I'll help.

636
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,490
There's so much food to prepare.

637
00:44:06,494 --> 00:44:08,035
She can't do it alone.

638
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,560
Every now and then,

639
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,135
you really seem like a different person.

640
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,535
That's exactly my point.

641
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:17,505
Regardless, this time,

642
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:19,800
let's prepare a proper table...

643
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:22,585
and let your father feast.

644
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:25,640
I think it's thanks to your father...

645
00:44:25,646 --> 00:44:28,855
that you came back to life the way you did.

646
00:44:32,687 --> 00:44:34,555
Anyway, my little puppy.

647
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:36,725
I hear you're studying hard lately.

648
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:38,690
Yes. He's turned a new leaf.

649
00:44:38,693 --> 00:44:40,195
That's good.

650
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:43,805
You take after your dad, so you'll come in first.

651
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,260
I can't come in first because of math.

652
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,200
That's absurd.

653
00:44:48,202 --> 00:44:51,405
Your dad was a math genius.

654
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,915
Ask him to teach you. Okay?

655
00:44:55,242 --> 00:44:57,610
I had Hyun Chul teach me math in high school,

656
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,340
and he was so mean.

657
00:44:59,346 --> 00:45:02,185
He yelled at me and was a total pain.

658
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,625
Seriously.

659
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,755
I'll teach you. Ask me anytime.

660
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:15,935
It would've been so nice if your father were here.

661
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:20,335
Don't you miss your father?

662
00:45:20,835 --> 00:45:24,645
Your father did everything for you.

663
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:27,745
Kids. Eat up.

664
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:30,810
Let's enjoy our meal. Mi Ho, eat up.

665
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,015
Okay.

666
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,115
You're so cute.

667
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:44,995
So it was a bit strange.

668
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:46,835
- I'm sorry. - Hey.

669
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:50,605
- Wait for me, kids! - Father.

670
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,035
Hello?

671
00:46:27,168 --> 00:46:28,800
Father, where are you?

672
00:46:28,803 --> 00:46:32,405
Me? I'm in Sokcho right now.

673
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:35,675
I had to come for a friend's funeral.

674
00:46:35,743 --> 00:46:37,045
I see.

675
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,740
I'm sorry, Father.

676
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:42,985
For what? Just live a good life.

677
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:45,155
I'll be good to you.

678
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:46,995
Live a long life.

679
00:46:47,254 --> 00:46:50,065
Just hang up if you called to say stupid things.

680
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:51,565
Bye.

681
00:46:56,463 --> 00:46:57,705
Yes?

682
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:01,735
What brings you by?

683
00:47:02,937 --> 00:47:05,940
I came to have lunch with you. Do you have time?

684
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,745
I'd make time if I had to. Let's go.

685
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,165
Mr. Song and his wife seem so happy together.

686
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:24,525
I know, right?

687
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:26,695
He's like someone else when he's with her.

688
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:29,465
They don't look like a married couple.

689
00:47:30,064 --> 00:47:32,260
It's more like they're having an affair...

690
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,635
or a second marriage. Like it's been only one month.

691
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:37,600
Why are they so happy together all of a sudden?

692
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,700
You should find a religion.

693
00:47:39,707 --> 00:47:42,045
The world may appear beautiful then.

694
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,945
That's why I don't.

695
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,355
What if Kang Ho was in Ji Soo's shoes?

696
00:47:55,823 --> 00:47:57,120
It would've been worse.

697
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,195
They're going through puberty.

698
00:47:59,994 --> 00:48:02,065
It's hard enough for adults like us.

699
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,330
Imagine how much harder it is for Ji Soo...

700
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:06,435
to accept and understand as a child.

701
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:12,305
Tomorrow,

702
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:15,145
the kids are going on a field trip.

703
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,845
I thought you should know.

704
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:29,925
Ji Soo.

705
00:48:33,894 --> 00:48:35,660
- Hello. - Hi,

706
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:36,935
Young Joo.

707
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:39,475
You go first.

708
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:41,905
Bye.

709
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,870
What are you doing here?

710
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:47,815
I came to see my daughter.

711
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:49,815
You're going on a field trip tomorrow, right?

712
00:48:50,044 --> 00:48:51,585
How did you know?

713
00:48:53,914 --> 00:48:56,485
Kang Ho must have told you.

714
00:48:57,284 --> 00:49:00,155
I'll make you gimbap tomorrow.

715
00:49:01,422 --> 00:49:04,165
I always made you gimbap for your field trips.

716
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,590
You always said...

717
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:08,095
my gimbap is the best in the world.

718
00:49:09,763 --> 00:49:12,105
I'll ask Mom.

719
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,875
Okay.

720
00:49:14,335 --> 00:49:16,405
I'll do it if Mom says so.

721
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:18,305
Thanks.

722
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:19,675
Ji Soo.

723
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,175
Wear this on your trip tomorrow.

724
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:36,665
(Hyun Chul)

725
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:41,795
Hello?

726
00:49:44,164 --> 00:49:45,430
Should I pick up anything?

727
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:46,635
Hold on.

728
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:53,475
My goodness.

729
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:55,575
We're out of eggs.

730
00:49:55,843 --> 00:49:58,070
We have everything else, but I couldn't get eggs.

731
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,615
Can you pick some up?

732
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:01,185
Will do.

733
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,965
He hasn't changed. How annoying.

734
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,975
I can't wear this for a field trip.

735
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:31,845
Okay. Let's go for dinner!

736
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:36,410
Mr. Song won't be able to attend.

737
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:38,055
His child has a field trip tomorrow.

738
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,180
Mr. Song cares about...

739
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:42,550
children's field trips?

740
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:44,825
He is so inconsistent.

741
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:46,360
Mr. Yook.

742
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,260
Why don't you move into Ms. Kwak's office?

743
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:50,805
There's bad energy in there. I don't want to.

744
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:52,875
Then should I move in there?

745
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:57,645
There's a hierarchy. That's not right.

746
00:50:58,038 --> 00:51:00,170
Hierarchy and order.

747
00:51:00,174 --> 00:51:02,970
You must value things like that a lot.

748
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:06,585
Of course. I'm more conservative than I look.

749
00:51:08,348 --> 00:51:11,555
I heard you were in another line of work.

750
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:13,495
I was a firefighter.

751
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:18,425
So that's why you're so hot inside.

752
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:22,265
Fire.

753
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:25,235
- We know your secret - We know your secret

754
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,875
- We know your secret - We know your secret

755
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:46,725
Excuse me...

756
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:56,760
Did you shop to make Ji Soo's lunch tomorrow?

757
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:57,965
Yes.

758
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:01,605
What are you doing here?

759
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:05,175
For Ji Soo's lunch. I've always packed her lunch.

760
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,015
You did.

761
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,845
She loved...

762
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,585
Dad's fried shrimp in her lunchbox.

763
00:52:14,848 --> 00:52:16,980
I was going to make it for her this year.

764
00:52:16,984 --> 00:52:18,985
That's what I came to get too.

765
00:52:19,853 --> 00:52:22,425
They have fresh seafood here.

766
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:25,925
I see. That's why I came here too.

767
00:52:25,993 --> 00:52:27,620
I'll pack her lunch.

768
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:30,105
It's okay. I'm going to do it.

769
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,935
- Pack Kang Ho's for him. - I promised Ji Soo.

770
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:37,645
Don't do that anymore.

771
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:41,075
It's okay. It's uncomfortable for me.

772
00:52:43,877 --> 00:52:46,410
- I'll drive you home. - That's okay too.

773
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,615
I'll drive you. The grocery's heavy.

774
00:52:58,292 --> 00:52:59,890
Stay here. I'll get the car.

775
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:03,105
Okay. Then I'll wait here.

776
00:53:03,163 --> 00:53:04,435
Okay.

777
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:40,635
Hey. I'll be home soon.

778
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:43,245
I heard.

779
00:53:44,871 --> 00:53:46,775
I ran into him.

780
00:53:49,876 --> 00:53:52,345
Take the lunch Daddy packs for you tomorrow.

781
00:53:52,512 --> 00:53:54,115
That tastes better.

782
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,685
Okay.

783
00:55:07,788 --> 00:55:08,995
Sorry.

784
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,265
- Call an ambulance. - Hurry up.

785
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,560
Hello? There's been an accident.

786
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:50,960
Please come quickly.

787
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:52,660
Don't move her.

788
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:54,000
You can't move her.

789
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,400
- Hello? Can you hear us? - Give her some room.

790
00:55:56,403 --> 00:55:58,700
- What happened? - Do you think she's dead?

791
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:00,315
Are you okay?

792
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:57,365
- Hurry up. - Okay.

793
00:57:23,723 --> 00:57:24,820
- Ji Soo. - Mom!

794
00:57:24,825 --> 00:57:26,495
No. Ji Soo.

795
00:57:26,893 --> 00:57:28,190
What were you doing?

796
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,490
I thought you were with her. What were you doing?

797
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:33,235
Why did you let her get hit by a car?

798
00:57:33,934 --> 00:57:35,760
Get out. I don't need you.

799
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:37,300
Don't ever come here again.

800
00:57:37,304 --> 00:57:38,775
Get out! Go!

801
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:41,375
Mom!

802
00:57:52,686 --> 00:57:53,895
Ji Soo...

803
00:58:33,894 --> 00:58:35,265
Is Jo Yun Hwa's family here?

804
00:58:36,897 --> 00:58:38,990
- Mom. Mom! - You can't go in.

805
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:40,205
Mom!

806
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,005
She passed away.

807
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:36,995
Mom.

808
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,490
Mom.

809
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:44,660
May 28, 2018. At 08:08pm,

810
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,105
Jo Yun Hwa passed away.

811
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:49,805
Mom. Mom!

812
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,675
No! Mom!

813
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,275
Mom!

814
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,485
Mom!
