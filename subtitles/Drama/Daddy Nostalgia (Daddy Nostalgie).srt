1
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,544
- Hello?
- Sonny, it's your dad. You asleep?

2
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:43,797
No. Hey, man. I was exercising.

3
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:46,507
- Bullshit. You were sleeping.
- I wasn't.

4
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:50,135
This kid won't stop lying to me.
You still act like you're six.

5
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,721
Yeah, okay, Dad. I
act like I'm six.

6
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:57,766
Found a job yet, where you
work more than one day a week?

7
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,268
I've been looking.

8
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,228
Looking won't pay the rent.

9
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,896
All the money I won
from the cab accident..

10
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,565
is kicking ass in the
stock market, so relax.

11
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,401
- Don't blow it on worthless crap.
- I won't.

12
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:13,696
You should spend it
on your bar exam.

13
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:16,615
You're the lawyer. I
ain't taking a bar exam.

14
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:18,825
I got too much other
shit going on.

15
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:22,287
I don't know what
happened to you.

16
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,581
How're things going with
your girlfriend, Vanessa?

17
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:27,040
Things are going fine.

18
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:28,625
Shit!

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,876
I gotta go.

20
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:32,754
Shit! You turned off
the alarm clock again.

21
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:36,882
No! I mean, yes, I did, but I
thought you needed more sleep.

22
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:40,593
I shouldn't have stayed here.
That was a jerk thing to do.

23
00:01:40,844 --> 00:01:43,429
Why are you going to work?
It's Sunday.

24
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:47,432
I'm not going to work. I'm going
to brunch with potential clients.

25
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:51,269
That's how a party planner gets
business, by making contacts.

26
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,772
Meet with me. I'll order in from Cozy's.
We'll have fun.

27
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:58,775
I am sick of Cozy's. You order
in from there all the time.

28
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:00,610
The delivery guy's
your best friend.

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,028
He happens to be
pretty damn nice.

30
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,072
This is a rough
patch in my life.

31
00:02:05,322 --> 00:02:08,867
Syracuse is 0 and 3. And I
got those medical problems.

32
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:10,159
Medical problems?

33
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,038
A cab runs over your foot two years ago.
You're hospitalized one night.

34
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:16,164
First of all, that cab was huge.

35
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:20,501
And a jury decided that one night
of pain was worth $200,000.

36
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:22,670
- So there you go.
- Whatever.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,172
Why are you being so
nuts to me lately?

38
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:28,258
You refuse to move on
to the next phase.

39
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,343
I'd like to have a
family someday.

40
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:33,262
I need someone I can
rely on, not a playmate.

41
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:36,806
You need a father figure? "Stop
pulling your sister's hair!"

42
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:40,726
You know what? I'm gonna go
to Syracuse to see my mom.

43
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:44,729
- I'll be back on Wednesday.
- What are you talking about?

44
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:51,902
I had call for delivery, but it was crank call.
You want chocolate cake?

45
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:54,696
Come back later. I'll
Indian wrestle you.

46
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:56,197
You're going down, sucker.

47
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,490
We'll see about that.

48
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,867
Okay. Peace, out.

49
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:02,035
You're going to Syracuse?

50
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:04,120
I need time to think
and so do you.

51
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:05,413
Think about what?

52
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,291
Your life and why I
should be a part of it.

53
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:09,333
All right.

54
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,878
While you're at it, think
about getting a real job.

55
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:15,088
I got a real job!

56
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,803
Patrick Ewing, nice shot.

57
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,223
- Hey, Sonny.
- What's up, buddy boy?

58
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,558
I'm out the door. Hey, pal.

59
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:32,310
- Where you going?
- Manhattan.

60
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,103
You wanna take me with you?

61
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:36,522
All right, I guess.

62
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:38,565
Hold onto your money. Later on.

63
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:40,317
Okay, take care, Sonny.

64
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,985
See you.

65
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:44,404
Cadillac, I love it.

66
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:06,046
Surprise!

67
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,006
Just ignore him.

68
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:11,176
It's only Sonny.
It's only Sonny.

69
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,803
Yeah, it's only me.
It's only me.

70
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:17,514
- What's going on?
- Corinne's going-away party for Kevin.

71
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:20,600
She didn't tell me. The
roommate has a right to know.

72
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,060
She knew you'd
ruin the surprise.

73
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:24,353
No, I wouldn't.

74
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:28,023
Hey, surprise.

75
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:29,524
Surprise.

76
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:33,069
What's going on?

77
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,032
We wasted the good
surprise on you.

78
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:40,491
All right.

79
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,165
Is this your handiwork?

80
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,042
I guess.

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,169
See you in three hours.

82
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,837
Good to see you stiffs.
What've you been doing?

83
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,882
Last three weeks have been crazy.
I've been in Denver, Dallas..

84
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,844
I'm sleeping in the office. We're
going to trial on the fraud case.

85
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:07,055
Honey, it was a great surprise.
I was totally shocked.

86
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:10,683
No, you weren't! And I
worked so hard on this.

87
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,268
Need some help?

88
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,811
- Honey, your sister's here.
- Hey, sweetie.

89
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:16,980
I hate Sonny.

90
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,941
My client's out $7 million. All we
can sue on is breach of contract.

91
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:24,569
Maybe you can sue under the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

92
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,989
I gotta get back to the office.
You're the king.

93
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,699
Mikey, a pleasure.

94
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:32,159
- I'll see you at home.
- All right.

95
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:35,912
I'll walk you out.

96
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:40,958
I gotta admit, I'm still
weirded out when they kiss.

97
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,752
Why? They're gay. That's
what gay guys do.

98
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:47,713
I know, but they were like
brothers to us back in school.

99
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:51,341
They're still like our brothers.
Our very, very gay brothers.

100
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:55,512
What are you doing after this?
Going to a Klan meeting?

101
00:05:56,554 --> 00:06:00,349
Remember when Dad had that
barbecue for his friends & it rained..

102
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,809
so he and Mom went into
the kitchen and made..

103
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:06,145
100 hamburgers with
one frying pan?

104
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:11,650
You're not gonna let a little rain stop
you from making 100 hamburgers.

105
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,080
That relationship's lasted
longer than I thought it would.

106
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:31,625
Look at his eyes. He's bored.
I give it two more weeks.

107
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,252
Hey, excuse me. Everybody!

108
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:38,172
I'm sorry. I wanted to thank
you for coming tonight.

109
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:39,798
I guess I should say..

110
00:06:42,842 --> 00:06:43,676
I'm getting it.

111
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:48,430
Tomorrow I'm leaving for China to
represent the firm of Morton & Mandel.

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,517
Me, the same guy who once
shaved his ass to win a $5 bet.

113
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:54,685
Prove it!

114
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:58,063
Just kidding.

115
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:01,816
But I am real glad you're
all here tonight, because..

116
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,944
I'm gonna do what I never thought
I'd have the guts to do.

117
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:07,279
You're not proposing, are you?

118
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,075
Yeah, pal, I am.

119
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:14,410
Well, think about it, you know?

120
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,078
God, Sonny, shut up!

121
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:23,417
Anyway, will you?

122
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:25,669
Yeah.

123
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,006
Good call on the two weeks.

124
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,349
Sonny, what was that all about?

125
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,893
Congratulations. You and "Big
Boobs" McGee are gonna be happy.

126
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:46,561
Don't call her that.

127
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:50,982
You wanna tell your children you met
their mother as a waitress at Hooters?

128
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:54,234
Sonny, that was five years ago.
She's a doctor now..

129
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:56,570
and my fiancée, so from now on..

130
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,404
Dr. Big Boobs McGee.

131
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:00,948
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

132
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:02,950
I just..

133
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,410
got shit going on.

134
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,703
What's the matter?

135
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,288
Vanessa's gonna
break up with me..

136
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,082
and I don't know how to
make her wanna stay.

137
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,668
She's getting older. She
wants different things:

138
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:17,920
Career, stable
relationship, a family.

139
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:19,297
That's how they get.

140
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:22,424
I want things to go back to
the way they used to be.

141
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:25,218
When we were at Syracuse,
and Vanessa worshiped you.

142
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:28,012
- That was nice.
- Nobody hassled you to get a job.

143
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:30,055
Tommy and Phil
showered separately.

144
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:32,724
Those were the days.

145
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:35,101
- What're you doing?
- If I make this..

146
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:37,812
Vanessa will realize she
likes me the way I am.

147
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:39,396
You're going to the putt.

148
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:41,857
Remember, the roof
breaks to the right.

149
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,110
Yes! That's what I'm talk..

150
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:47,612
Good God!

151
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,280
That can't be good.

152
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,827
Where's Kevin?

153
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:00,122
He already left. I guess he
forgot to say goodbye to you.

154
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:03,708
- Why are you here?
- I'm cleaning because you're useless.

155
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,586
Then what, you gonna go
to your Hooters reunion?

156
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:10,339
You guys talk about whose ass hangs
out of their shorts the most?

157
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,216
At least I can fit my ass
in my shorts, fatty.

158
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,301
Speaking of fatty,
whose is this?

159
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:17,928
- I don't know.
- I'm eating it then.

160
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:21,514
"We wasted the good
surprise on you."

161
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:27,394
Lady gave me $5 to
bring him here.

162
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:29,229
- What do you mean?
- Later.

163
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:31,981
Are you selling raffle tickets?

164
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:40,363
Oh, boy.

165
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,743
- Kevin Gerrity.
- I got something to tell you.

166
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:46,827
What's up?

167
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,078
There's a kid here.

168
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:49,371
What kind of kid?

169
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,873
If this note is true,
it's your kid.

170
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:53,332
What do you mean?

171
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:57,169
I'm having a tough
time reading this..

172
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:00,505
but it says, "Dear Kevin:
This is Julian, your son."

173
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:03,424
I hope you understand why I
didn't tell you until now..

174
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:07,344
"..but he needs your help. I
can't be his mother anymore."

175
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:09,346
- This is ridiculous.
- Hang on.

176
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:11,597
Who's this?

177
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:14,183
This is my friend.

178
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,728
- Is that Kevin on the phone?
- No, it's my Uncle Remus.

179
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,356
What's your name?

180
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,983
Is he all right?

181
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,068
He doesn't like you.
Leave us alone.

182
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:27,652
You're such a dick.

183
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:30,822
That was your girlfriend. She
was acting "Hooterific."

184
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,656
Who sent that note?

185
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:33,782
"Jan."

186
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,993
Jan.. I don't know any Jan.

187
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:39,162
- Where's he from?
- Where are you from?

188
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:40,413
Buffalo.

189
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:42,706
I've never even been to Buffalo.

190
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:44,583
Maybe it's a mistake.

191
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,752
Is this like the time you
said my parents were dead?

192
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:49,587
I swear, he's right here.

193
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:53,048
I'm coming home. I don't
know what I'll say..

194
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:54,383
Hang on. It says..

195
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:58,886
"If you won't take responsibility for
him, they found a foster family.."

196
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:02,264
Yes, Uncle Remus, I know
the catfish are huge.

197
00:11:02,514 --> 00:11:03,682
That's terrific.

198
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,059
Here's a number for a guy..

199
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:09,020
at City Social Service. Arthur Brooks.
I'll call.

200
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,313
- I'll come home.
- I'll take care of it.

201
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:12,564
Are you sure?

202
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:13,899
Yeah, don't worry.

203
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,193
Hooters. Hooters. Hooters!

204
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,487
- All right. Thanks a lot.
- Later.

205
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:24,532
I'm gonna make
another phone call.

206
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:27,285
You want to come
and sit down, pal?

207
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:34,833
Or you can stand there. Anything
you want. I'll be a minute.

208
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,837
Social Services is closed
today, Columbus Day.

209
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,464
We'll be open tomorrow at 8 a.
m.

210
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:44,841
Columbus Day.

211
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:48,844
Boy, I don't know
what to tell you.

212
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:51,430
Everything's gonna get
figured out tomorrow.

213
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,098
Can you be a tough
little guy until then?

214
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:56,100
Great.

215
00:11:56,976 --> 00:12:00,228
Do I need to get you a bottle
of formula or something?

216
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:01,855
What do you eat?

217
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,439
Food.

218
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:05,775
Yeah? I eat food too.

219
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:08,193
What..? Come on.

220
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,989
You need me to hold your hand?

221
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:17,159
On Mondays, I go to Central Park
and watch rollerbladers fall down.

222
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:19,536
- You into that?
- I don't know.

223
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:22,122
Watch. This guy's humming.

224
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:25,499
He's going down, he's
going down, he's going..!

225
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,211
How old are you, anyways?

226
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:30,920
Five.

227
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,422
You wear a diaper?

228
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:38,343
You wipe your own ass then?

229
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:40,887
You do? Good job. That's cool.

230
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:44,640
Come on, fall down. Fall down.
Yes! Come on, damn it.

231
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,517
You suck. You suck!

232
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,102
Check this out.

233
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:03,989
My God!

234
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,200
There's a stick there.
Somebody should move it.

235
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,536
All right now, what way
would you put that on?

236
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:13,205
This Columbo, he
pretends to be stupid..

237
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:15,249
but he's really smart as a tack.

238
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:16,750
Oh, yeah, he is.

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,962
You put the vane on down there.
Then this boat comes up.

240
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:23,255
I wipe my own ass.

241
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:25,507
Me too.

242
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:30,845
So, Mr. Ass Wiper,
what's this guy's name?

243
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,721
Scuba Steve.

244
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:35,057
Does he ever take
his flippers off?

245
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,017
What if he goes bowling?

246
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:40,353
They don't make him wear bowling shoes?
He wears flippers?

247
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:41,437
Really?

248
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,814
I had a doll like
that at one time.

249
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:46,608
But my cat, he
bite his head off.

250
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,192
What cat would do that?

251
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:49,485
You calling me a liar?

252
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,445
Hey, take it easy.

253
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:53,905
Anyways..

254
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:55,949
Jets are playing tonight.

255
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,993
We're gonna go to the Blarney Stone.
Wanna come?

256
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:00,744
I've got more deliveries.

257
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:03,622
Maybe you can also finish
the turkey on your lip.

258
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,081
Right there.

259
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:11,670
Let's crank up the Styx.

260
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,547
No music during the game.

261
00:14:13,797 --> 00:14:16,966
- It's halftime. Relax, Mr. Herlihy.
- Goddamn Jets.

262
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:19,135
What are you doing
in here, cutie?

263
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:21,261
Watching football.

264
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:24,431
- Who do you want to win?
- The goddamn Jets.

265
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,350
Have fun.

266
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:32,604
Too bad you don't like girls.
I think you could've had her.

267
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:35,189
- I'm thirsty.
- You're thirsty?

268
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,149
Are you allowed soda?

269
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,234
I don't know.

270
00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:40,444
My mom always said
soda rots your teeth..

271
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:42,987
but you'll lose them
anyway, so rot on.

272
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,698
- Can we get two root beers?
- Sure.

273
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:51,036
When I graduated law school, we met
here every Monday to watch football.

274
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,788
Who would meet you?

275
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:55,873
My friends, Vanessa.

276
00:14:56,415 --> 00:15:00,627
Vanessa always rooted against the team
I wanted to win just to bust my chops.

277
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:04,464
But everybody's so busy with
their crap lately, no one comes.

278
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:06,507
Like I'm not busy?

279
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:10,135
Shut up or I'll smack you through
the wall like last Monday.

280
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:13,596
Last Monday was a fluke.
Bring it on, woman.

281
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:18,100
Anytime.

282
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,270
He drinks a lot of soda.

283
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,777
I'm telling you, buddy. Vanessa,
she's the one. I can't lose her.

284
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:32,820
I'm not getting any handsomer.

285
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,698
Every day I get a little bit
older and balder and fatter.

286
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:37,699
Fatter?

287
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:41,327
At your age I could eat anything.
Wouldn't gain an ounce.

288
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:45,164
Now, I have a chocolate shake,
my ass jiggles for a week.

289
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:49,292
- Enjoy the metabolism while you got it.
- Metalobism?

290
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:54,255
Good God, it's 2:30 in the morning.
You must be wrecked.

291
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:58,258
Anyways, I had fun today.
Did you have fun?

292
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,010
Yeah, you're all right.

293
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,179
Have a good one.

294
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:09,017
Could I have a night-light?

295
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:12,394
Night-light? I think I can
help you out. Hang on.

296
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:22,736
Let's see here.

297
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:26,531
There you go, all right?

298
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:31,243
Are you my dad?

299
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:35,914
No, I'm not, but..

300
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:39,292
that Dad and Mom thing we'll
figure out in the morning.

301
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,211
You just go to sleep.

302
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,256
- Good night.
- Good night.

303
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:04,145
Go get the can, okay?

304
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:06,439
Go! Go! Go!

305
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,777
I'm thinking about
keeping the kid.

306
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:17,031
Remember when we went
to the pet store..

307
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:21,243
and you wanted that puppy, but I
reminded you about feeding it..

308
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:23,453
cleaning it and
toilet training it?

309
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:26,581
This is kind of like that,
except with a human.

310
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:30,250
I mean, I'm glad you had fun
and all, but this is big.

311
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,795
I gotta do something big. I think
Vanessa will respect that.

312
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:38,424
You think that since women get pregnant
to fix a troubled relationship..

313
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:41,218
why can't a guy adopt
a kid to do the same?

314
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:45,096
I didn't think of it like that. But
yes, that's what I'm thinking.

315
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:48,724
Sounds nuts to me, pal. Do
yourself a favor. Sleep on it.

316
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:50,809
You're right. Can
I use your phone?

317
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,774
Arthur Brooks speaking.

318
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,734
How you doing? Kevin Gerrity.

319
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:02,402
Right on, Mr. Gerrity.

320
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:03,903
We were expecting you.

321
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:07,406
Do you still got a foster
family lined up for Julian?

322
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:08,490
Yes, we do.

323
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,618
I've decided to take
care of the little guy.

324
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:13,578
Way to sleep on it, pal.

325
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:16,580
You two want to get
married, I support that.

326
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,917
When parents take the responsibility,
there's no bigger high for us.

327
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,585
I'm psyched about it too.

328
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,836
So that's it.

329
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,046
Yep. Good luck to
you and your son.

330
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:28,507
My son.

331
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:34,136
Goddamn stick!

332
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:35,846
That's my boy.

333
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,400
Go back to sleep.

334
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:57,238
Well, I'm going back to sleep.
Nighty-night.

335
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:59,365
I wet my bed.

336
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:19,215
Oh, God.

337
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,009
That's a shitload of piss.

338
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:38,397
There you go, all right?

339
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,524
No more wetness.

340
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,944
Sleep, all right? Just try to sleep.
Stay asleep.

341
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,681
Sit still!

342
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:20,182
Lay!

343
00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:29,565
All right! I'm up!

344
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:33,318
It smells like urine in this joint.
Good job.

345
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,986
What're you doing there, boy?

346
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:37,488
Making cereal.

347
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,615
Oh, yeah? Why don't
you pour me a bowl?

348
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,579
Or don't pour me a bowl.
Either way.

349
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,665
I got it. I got it.

350
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,668
We can fix this.

351
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:57,379
It's not a big deal.

352
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:59,214
Look. See?

353
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:01,633
See how quick it goes away?

354
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:03,926
Crybaby, come on.

355
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:05,928
Don't worry about it, boy.

356
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:10,640
Scuba Steve, damn you!

357
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:14,310
You think that's funny,
me getting hurt?

358
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:22,692
There's a bright side to being up
before 11: McDonald's breakfast.

359
00:21:22,942 --> 00:21:25,777
I haven't been up for that in 10 years.
You wanna go?

360
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:29,030
Tie your shoes, we'll go. Hurry.

361
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:33,033
It's like 12 blocks from
here, so tie quickly.

362
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:39,080
Do you need help with that?

363
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,957
I can do it.

364
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,126
Let me do it.

365
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:50,590
You loop it, you swoop
it and you pull.

366
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,926
You loop it, you
swoop it, you pull.

367
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:56,094
Good. Let's go.
We're in a hurry.

368
00:21:56,678 --> 00:21:58,471
It's different for
your generation.

369
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:01,390
You've always had McDonald's
breakfast available.

370
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,683
I have?

371
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,977
When I was born, all we had
were the burgers and fries.

372
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:09,647
Maybe the fish sandwich. I'm not sure.
I'll get back to you.

373
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:11,148
What are you doing?

374
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:13,650
Oh, yeah, the
hand-holding thing.

375
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:18,613
My dad took us to McDonald's the
first morning they had breakfast.

376
00:22:18,863 --> 00:22:22,366
Everybody was baffled. "Are
these sausages or hamburgers?"

377
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:24,326
I have to go to the bathroom.

378
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,661
We're gonna be
there in a minute.

379
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:28,371
I gotta go now.

380
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:30,206
Didn't you pee enough in bed?

381
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:34,209
We only got nine
minutes to get there.

382
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:37,461
But I gotta go to the bathroom.

383
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:39,213
All right, let's go.

384
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,299
Can my kid use the
bathroom for a minute?

385
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:43,466
Customers only.

386
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:45,802
He's just a kid.
We'll be in and out.

387
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:47,386
That's not my problem.

388
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:50,180
It's not your problem?
All right.

389
00:22:50,514 --> 00:22:51,556
Come on.

390
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,228
Here you are. Your waiter
will be right with you.

391
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:00,147
I can't do it.

392
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:02,774
What do you mean, you can't do it?
Just go.

393
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:06,193
I'm scared. Could you do it too?

394
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:09,321
All right.

395
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,533
Here we go.

396
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:15,743
And we're off.

397
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,372
That's not too difficult, right?

398
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:23,166
And we're both losing weight.

399
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:26,752
Good job. We're gonna
miss breakfast. Let's go.

400
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:28,545
Put it away.

401
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:35,134
- Thanks, anyways.
- Sure thing. Anytime.

402
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:37,011
Move your ass there, pee-boy.

403
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:40,555
We only got 5 minutes, 5 minutes.
Now four.

404
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:43,015
Come on. We're almost there.

405
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:46,226
Hey, mister. Why are you
sitting on the ground?

406
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:47,811
This is where I live.

407
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:49,062
We gotta get going.

408
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:50,146
Why?

409
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:53,899
In retrospect, I made some bad
choices after high school.

410
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,901
- We gotta get going.
- Why?

411
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,612
This was during the
so-called Disco Era..

412
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:02,448
but for me, it was more
the Doing Mushrooms Era.

413
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:05,034
- We're gonna miss breakfast.
- Why?

414
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:06,577
I never thought about that.

415
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:09,329
I was never Mr. Popularity
in high school..

416
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:12,081
and I watched Fantasia a lot.

417
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:13,916
- One day it clicked.
- Hey, yappy.

418
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,376
If you end it, you
get an Egg McMuffin.

419
00:24:16,626 --> 00:24:18,712
How about a Sausage
McMuffin with hash browns?

420
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:20,254
You got a deal.

421
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,466
Look, look. He fell asleep.
Let's go.

422
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,218
Let's go.

423
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:32,765
Sausage McMuffin.

424
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,266
Pardon me, sir.

425
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,767
How you doing?

426
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,477
What can I get for you?

427
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,562
- What do you want?
- Cheerios.

428
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,439
They don't got Cheerios.

429
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,315
Lasagna.

430
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,484
What's the matter? We'll
take hot cakes and sausage.

431
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,736
Sorry. We stopped
serving breakfast.

432
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:50,905
We're four seconds late.

433
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:54,574
You're 30 minutes and four seconds late.
Breakfast stops at 10:30.

434
00:24:54,783 --> 00:24:55,867
Horseshit!

435
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,538
Don't cry. Sorry.

436
00:25:00,788 --> 00:25:02,623
I was cursing at
the lady, not you.

437
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:03,915
Nice parenting.

438
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:06,584
Thanks. Are you my therapist?
Take a walk.

439
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,377
Do you want a Happy Meal?

440
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:10,171
You got a Happy Meal?

441
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:12,381
Will somebody get the
kid a Happy Meal?!

442
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:13,965
Relax.

443
00:25:14,174 --> 00:25:15,550
Where's my Egg McMuffin?

444
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:17,635
Breakfast is over at 10:30.

445
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:20,888
- Really? I thought it was 11.
- I thought that too.

446
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:24,182
Total mind blower.

447
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:26,642
Will you just relax? Here.

448
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,561
What do you want me to do?

449
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:31,938
You're gonna meet Vanessa tonight.
You'll like her.

450
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:34,899
You wanna see me get hurt?
That'll cheer you up?

451
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:36,817
All right.

452
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:44,324
You think that's funny?

453
00:25:45,658 --> 00:25:46,993
Good. No more crying.

454
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:48,244
Are you okay?

455
00:25:48,494 --> 00:25:50,495
Next time, kill me.

456
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:07,635
Let's do it, Rangers.

457
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:10,387
- Rangers against the
Tampa Bay Lightning.

458
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,888
And at this stage..

459
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:15,975
it's as close as you can get to a
must-win game for the Rangers.

460
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:17,768
Or they'll fall behind..

461
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:18,810
How you doing?

462
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:19,978
How you doing?

463
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:21,563
You like hockey?

464
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:22,855
You like hockey?

465
00:26:23,397 --> 00:26:25,024
This is a big, important game.

466
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:26,817
This is a big, important game.

467
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:28,193
Cut the crap.

468
00:26:28,527 --> 00:26:29,694
Cut the crap.

469
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:32,697
I'm serious. Don't do that.

470
00:26:32,947 --> 00:26:34,615
I'm serious. Don't do that.

471
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:38,368
How much wood would a woodchuck
chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

472
00:26:39,577 --> 00:26:41,120
That's what I thought. Shut up.

473
00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:44,331
Don't you take naps?

474
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:45,666
Sometimes.

475
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,125
Go take a nap.

476
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:49,336
I'm too hungry to sleep.

477
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,879
You want some food?

478
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:07,058
Having a kid is great..

479
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,646
as long as his eyes are closed
and he's not moving or speaking.

480
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:36,124
He's taken down! Penalty shot!

481
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:43,589
How you doing? You sleepwalking?

482
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:46,424
Why don't you go back sleepy?
Sleepy.

483
00:27:46,674 --> 00:27:48,217
Keep napping. What's this?

484
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:49,468
Kangaroo song.

485
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:53,305
That's terrific. And we'll watch
this after the game, okay?

486
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,933
But after my nap, I always
watch the kangaroo song.

487
00:27:57,266 --> 00:28:01,061
It's overtime, and there's a
penalty shot about to take place.

488
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:02,396
It happens every 10 years..

489
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:04,689
Kangaroo song. Kangaroo song!

490
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:10,319
All right!

491
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:13,363
God! You were normal yesterday.

492
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:27,249
I can't take this.
Are you serious?

493
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,959
Come and play

494
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,129
What do you say?

495
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,714
Douche-bag kangaroo.

496
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,968
Are you all hopped out?

497
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,223
I don't know what to do.
Hopefully Vanessa will.

498
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,893
I think she's back. If she's
not back, we'll wait for her.

499
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:51,603
Get your coat. Clean up.

500
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:56,315
Oh, God. You don't
have to pee, do you?

501
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:58,984
- Do you swear?
- I swear.

502
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:02,195
How come you're not going?

503
00:29:02,445 --> 00:29:06,157
I don't have to go. Only you and my
grandfather go every 30 seconds.

504
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:09,326
Let's hurry it up, all right?
I'm keeping you company.

505
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:14,205
He'll write your name on the wall.
Mind your business.

506
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:17,916
Let's go. Let's go.

507
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:21,002
Why do I need to meet this lady?

508
00:29:21,252 --> 00:29:23,421
- Now it is your problem.
- Thank you.

509
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,589
She's that lady I was
telling you about.

510
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,425
She's gonna be a big
part of your life.

511
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:31,636
I'm scared. What
if she's not nice?

512
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:33,095
Look.

513
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:37,140
See these right here? These
are magic sunglasses, okay?

514
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:39,642
If you're afraid, put them
on to become invisible.

515
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:41,727
Really? Nobody can see me?

516
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:43,187
Put them on.

517
00:29:47,315 --> 00:29:48,608
Sonny, I'm right here.

518
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:50,902
Oh, the glasses. I
couldn't see you.

519
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:54,863
Keep those on. No one can notice
you until you decide they can.

520
00:29:55,113 --> 00:29:55,989
- Okay.
- Let's go.

521
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,327
I'm still right here.

522
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:03,746
Okay, all right, the glasses.

523
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,792
Welcome back.

524
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:10,960
Who's that?

525
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,504
Who's who? He's invisible.

526
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,172
Can I come in?

527
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:17,715
Sure.

528
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,384
Any invisible people out here..

529
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:22,636
feel free to come in, okay?

530
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:28,141
Sonny, I don't really know
what's going on right now.

531
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:31,268
- We should talk..
- You said I got some thinking to do?

532
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:32,811
So I did it.

533
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:36,814
Just because I don't have a job
doesn't mean I don't wanna move on.

534
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:39,400
Instead of saying that,
I figured I'd show you.

535
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,944
- Before you say anything..
- Look at that.

536
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:43,695
He took his sunglasses off.

537
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:45,989
He wants you to see him.
He likes you.

538
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:47,657
Julian, come here.

539
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:50,409
Come here, pal.

540
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:52,035
Vanessa..

541
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:55,205
I want you to meet
Julian, my son.

542
00:30:56,372 --> 00:30:57,832
Our son. I adopted him.

543
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,084
I don't know what to say.

544
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:02,711
Don't say anything.

545
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,715
Is someone in the bathroom?

546
00:31:10,092 --> 00:31:11,051
Why is the door shut?

547
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:12,135
I don't know.

548
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:13,595
You don't?

549
00:31:15,388 --> 00:31:16,847
I don't know.

550
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:21,685
I can't believe this.

551
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:24,562
Open up.

552
00:31:27,022 --> 00:31:28,857
Open the door!

553
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:33,069
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, my God.

554
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:35,529
I'm sorry. I was
freaking out there.

555
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,364
- I'm Sonny.
- Sid.

556
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:41,534
I had an attack of paranoia. I thought
you were sleeping with my girl.

557
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:43,244
I am.

558
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:44,412
What's that?

559
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:46,914
I am.

560
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:50,584
That's what I was trying to tell you before.
I found someone.

561
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,710
- This old guy?
- Sid.

562
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:54,754
He's already achieved so much..

563
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:57,881
and yet he's still goal-oriented
and still focused.

564
00:31:58,131 --> 00:31:59,633
And he has a five-year plan.

565
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:01,384
What is it? "Don't die"?

566
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,472
I can't believe this. We got a family now.
This is what you wanted.

567
00:32:06,722 --> 00:32:09,432
You surprising me with a
kid that you adopted..

568
00:32:09,683 --> 00:32:12,018
wasn't what I wanted.
- I did this for you.

569
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:16,105
You wanted me to be more responsible.
I can't raise this kid alone.

570
00:32:16,355 --> 00:32:19,649
You remind me of my grandson.
You don't think things through.

571
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:22,777
Hey, Old Man River, zip it
or I'll break your hip.

572
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,070
- I'd like to see you try it.
- Shut up.

573
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,864
How'd you misconstrue
the situation so badly?

574
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,741
I don't know.

575
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,577
Deep down you must've known
this day was coming.

576
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,330
You made the biggest
mistake of your life.

577
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,707
I know you'll be missing
me when you got..

578
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,251
that big, white, wrinkly..

579
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,961
body on top of you..

580
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:46,004
with his loose skin..

581
00:32:46,254 --> 00:32:48,048
and old balls.

582
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:49,924
Gross.

583
00:32:57,597 --> 00:33:00,766
Excuse me. How you doing?
I'm Kevin Gerrity.

584
00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:03,852
I got an emergency problem.
Is Arthur Brooks around?

585
00:33:04,102 --> 00:33:05,562
I'll go get him for you.

586
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:08,940
Stay where I can see you.
I gotta talk to this guy.

587
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,691
Mr. Gerrity?

588
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:14,236
- Arthur Brooks.
- How are you? I need to speak with you.

589
00:33:14,486 --> 00:33:16,488
I didn't tell you to
come here, did I?

590
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:18,781
I was gonna mail
you the paperwork.

591
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,908
It's like the opposite of that.

592
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,327
Look, I can't manage this kid.

593
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,454
I ain't a good father.
I made a big mistake.

594
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:27,497
Mistake?

595
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:30,082
I had a mother
lined up for him..

596
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:32,960
but she's banging the
Pepperidge Farm guy.

597
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,420
The kid won't stop
peeing and throwing up.

598
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,297
He's like a cooker spaniel.
I just..

599
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:40,883
He'd be better off with
his natural mother.

600
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:44,427
Well, she passed away
last night, Mr. Gerrity.

601
00:33:44,677 --> 00:33:49,014
She had cancer. She must have sensed
that her time was running short.

602
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:51,933
She wanted her son to be
with the natural father.

603
00:33:54,894 --> 00:33:56,187
Loop.

604
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:57,897
Pull.

605
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:00,566
If you don't wanna
take care of him..

606
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:04,360
we'll take him. But he'll have
to chill in a group home.

607
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:06,320
Group home? Like an orphanage?

608
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:08,030
We don't call them that.

609
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:13,826
Look, I did it. Loop,
swoop and pull.

610
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:15,036
You did do it.

611
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,662
Congratulations, kid.

612
00:34:16,912 --> 00:34:18,497
I showed him that.

613
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:21,166
Why don't you go back
over there, okay?

614
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:24,669
- I'll call the Heatherton Home..
- Let's do this.

615
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:28,297
I'll hang onto the kid until
you find him a new family.

616
00:34:28,547 --> 00:34:31,883
I don't know. I gotta watch out
for the kid's best interest.

617
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:34,385
You said yourself you
were a bogus dad.

618
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:36,720
He's better off with me
than in an orphanage.

619
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:39,723
I don't wanna put him in a
home any more than you do.

620
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:42,767
Why don't we pretend you
didn't even come in here?

621
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:45,936
I'll give you a shout
when I line up a family.

622
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:47,396
- That's good.
- Later.

623
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:49,481
Just don't make me regret this.

624
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,691
Where are we going now?

625
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:56,070
I gotta make a phone call. Just
stay right here, all right?

626
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:04,160
- This is a collect call from:
- Your baby boy.

627
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,162
- To accept charges, say, "Yes."
- Yeah, I'll accept.

628
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:09,456
Dad, how's it going?
How's Florida?

629
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:13,084
Not too bad. Your mother got
a sunburn playing tennis.

630
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:16,253
- I got some interesting news.
- Oh, yeah? What?

631
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:18,213
Kind of adopted a kid.

632
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:19,547
What do you mean?

633
00:35:19,797 --> 00:35:22,717
I'm talking about you
being a grandfather.

634
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,718
Who the hell would
give you a kid?

635
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:26,428
Social Services.

636
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:28,930
You idiot. You better
give that kid back.

637
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,807
His mother's..

638
00:35:31,098 --> 00:35:32,266
Hang on.

639
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:34,518
Go play with them
pigeons, buddy.

640
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,937
I tried to give him back. I just can't.
All right?

641
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:39,605
I need your help.

642
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:43,442
I'm in a bad way. Vanessa dumped me.
I don't know what I'm doing.

643
00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:45,444
You're damn right.

644
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:47,445
The kid is always around.

645
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:49,864
He never leaves me alone.

646
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:53,325
You'd think he'd want some privacy.
I'm in deep shit.

647
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:56,369
Give that kid back before
you ruin both your lives.

648
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,787
I appreciate that.

649
00:35:58,037 --> 00:36:00,081
He's better off
living in a dumpster.

650
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:01,999
I'll be a better
father than you!

651
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:04,584
Impossible! All you
care about is yourself!

652
00:36:04,835 --> 00:36:08,254
Yeah? No, I care about you
saving money on this call!

653
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:14,968
Let's eat.

654
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:18,596
The Vanessa thing
did not work out.

655
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:22,307
She lost her damn mind. That
wasn't your fault, though, okay?

656
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:28,145
I know when you first got here, you
thought you were gonna meet your dad.

657
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:30,731
But I don't think
that's gonna happen.

658
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:31,857
Why?

659
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,400
I don't know.

660
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,527
But, buddy, real dads
aren't always that great.

661
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,654
I got one and he's
out of his mind.

662
00:36:38,904 --> 00:36:42,741
He tells me what to do. He never
lets me figure stuff out on my own.

663
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:46,202
A lot of dads are like that.
That's why people grow up nuts.

664
00:36:47,036 --> 00:36:48,454
Look at this guy.

665
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:52,499
He was probably a nice boy like you.
Then his dad messed his mind up.

666
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:54,167
Who won the Jets game?

667
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:55,376
Who cares?

668
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:57,878
Let it go. He can't
control you anymore.

669
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,171
What do you mean?

670
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:00,464
You know.

671
00:37:00,714 --> 00:37:01,631
You're a loser.

672
00:37:01,882 --> 00:37:04,592
You're mad at your dad, not at me!
I forgive you!

673
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:07,678
I am. I am. I hate my father.

674
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:11,473
I don't want it to be like that.
I don't wanna control you.

675
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:13,308
You even like your name?

676
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:14,809
I guess.

677
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:17,186
You guess? Shouldn't
you like your name?

678
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:19,771
It'll be your name the
rest of your life.

679
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:21,481
What do you want?

680
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:25,109
Frankenstein.

681
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,528
I can deal with that. I'll
call you Frankenstein.

682
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,780
Frankenstein, you gonna
play in the puddle?

683
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:34,283
Go ahead. From now on, you
do whatever you wanna do.

684
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:36,785
I'll show you some cool
shit along the way.

685
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:38,662
That's what it's all about.

686
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:42,623
Stay in front of it.
Don't be scared.

687
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:44,750
It's coming right at you.

688
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:46,251
Okay. All right.

689
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:48,920
You're picking your head up.
Don't do that.

690
00:37:50,421 --> 00:37:52,048
Is this okay?

691
00:37:52,298 --> 00:37:54,091
That's what you wanna wear?

692
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,426
That's okay with me then.

693
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:59,137
Good luck walking
down the street.

694
00:38:00,888 --> 00:38:02,598
Way to block it. Stay with it.

695
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,975
You're the next Willie Randolph.

696
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:17,861
Chief Jay Strongbow used
to do a sleeper hold.

697
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:19,320
Put your arm under here.

698
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,907
Lift this arm, okay? Slide
under and try to lock wrists.

699
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:25,659
Let me show you. Watch.

700
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:28,453
Throw him into the ropes
and he comes back..

701
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:31,622
Get him. Get him. Lock him up.

702
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:33,248
Lock wrists.

703
00:38:33,624 --> 00:38:35,167
You bring him down slow.

704
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,043
Apply pressure.

705
00:38:37,377 --> 00:38:38,961
He's going to sleep now.

706
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:42,715
See, he's out.

707
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,225
Wake up.

708
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,232
You'll be the only kid
your age with a slingshot.

709
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:08,027
Go have some fun. Shoot a
few beer cans or something.

710
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,073
You like that?

711
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:19,453
Sonny, Sonny, come here!

712
00:39:19,703 --> 00:39:21,663
What is it? What's the matter?

713
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:29,211
Let me have that.

714
00:39:30,254 --> 00:39:33,173
Go to your room. I think.
Or do whatever you want.

715
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:36,342
It's gonna be fun. You nervous?

716
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:38,802
No? You're excited, aren't you?

717
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:41,513
Let's go. Up, up, up.

718
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,016
Here comes some candy.

719
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:48,686
How you doing?

720
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,564
Happy Halloween! We
got a first-timer.

721
00:39:57,151 --> 00:39:58,485
Do the right thing, buddy.

722
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:00,946
We want some candy!

723
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:07,951
Hang on right here for a second.
Don't move.

724
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,173
Yeah, that's it.

725
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,509
Yeah, CDs. You like that?

726
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,387
He's not happy.
What else you got?

727
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,557
Okay, that's good.
Trick-or-treat.

728
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,894
Say, "Happy Halloween."

729
00:40:40,145 --> 00:40:42,146
Thank you.

730
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:44,898
Next year, be prepared, moron.

731
00:40:48,235 --> 00:40:49,819
What's with the cummerbund?

732
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:51,821
I let him wear
whatever he wants.

733
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:53,531
Those boots are the best.

734
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:55,616
I think they're Kevin's.

735
00:40:55,908 --> 00:40:59,119
I'll have a hot dog with
the mustard and a knish.

736
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:00,787
Frankenstein, what do you want?

737
00:41:01,037 --> 00:41:02,538
Thirty packets of ketchup.

738
00:41:02,788 --> 00:41:05,249
All right. Thirty
packets of ketchup.

739
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,209
Nice cut, pal.

740
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:11,295
Frankenstein.

741
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:14,047
Do that thing I taught
you the other day.

742
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,972
It took him 20 minutes to learn that.
He's quick. He's smart.

743
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:26,224
- And he loves ketchup.
- He does.

744
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:28,810
This is a whole new
school of child-raising.

745
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,396
You give him options, not orders.
Let him make the decision.

746
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:33,772
You're a pioneer.

747
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:36,983
- So you two just chill out all day?
- Basically.

748
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:40,653
Hung out on the monkey bars.
The kid did eight chin-ups.

749
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:43,363
I can't even do one with
these scrawny arms.

750
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:45,699
They're not scrawny.
They're nice.

751
00:41:46,616 --> 00:41:48,784
What do you wanna do tomorrow?

752
00:41:49,035 --> 00:41:50,703
I wanna go to school.

753
00:41:50,953 --> 00:41:54,331
I don't force him, he makes the
right decision. Way to go.

754
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:57,333
We'll enroll you on Monday.
Enjoy the weekend.

755
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:58,793
Do the thing again.

756
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:09,260
That one touched the ground.

757
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,636
That was awesome!

758
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:12,137
Good job.

759
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:19,018
Help me! Help me!

760
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:22,145
Please help me. I don't
know where I live.

761
00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:24,564
This isn't a big problem.

762
00:42:24,814 --> 00:42:26,983
We'll find your parents.

763
00:42:27,274 --> 00:42:29,526
- What's your name?
- Frankenstein.

764
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:31,695
There you are.

765
00:42:31,945 --> 00:42:34,072
There you are. Are
you okay, buddy?

766
00:42:34,906 --> 00:42:36,866
I turn my head and
he disappeared.

767
00:42:37,116 --> 00:42:39,910
Don't you ever do that to me again.
Don't do that.

768
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:43,037
Thank you for being
sweet to my little boy.

769
00:42:43,288 --> 00:42:44,997
You're welcome, Sonny.

770
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:49,376
I think my sister, Corinne,
is engaged to your roommate.

771
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:52,378
Your sister's Corinne?
That sucks.

772
00:42:52,629 --> 00:42:55,423
Yeah, I'm up from D.C.
I was at that party..

773
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:58,175
where we wasted the
good surprise on you.

774
00:42:58,425 --> 00:42:59,509
Sorry about that.

775
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:01,803
So, what, you have a son now?

776
00:43:02,053 --> 00:43:04,972
I'm not his dad. I'm more
of a father-figure type..

777
00:43:05,222 --> 00:43:08,016
until Social Services
can get another family.

778
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:10,310
At which point, you'll
find a new way..

779
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,396
to initiate conversations
with girls in the park.

780
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:15,356
Yeah, that's correct.

781
00:43:18,692 --> 00:43:19,859
Good job, buddy!

782
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:21,611
He's peeing on his own.

783
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:23,446
Keep it flowing! That's it!

784
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:25,739
Go! Go!

785
00:43:26,156 --> 00:43:28,742
So does Corinne's
sister have a name?

786
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,201
It's Layla.

787
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:32,912
Layla? I like your song.

788
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:35,080
Could you do me a favor?

789
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,748
Could you hang out with me?

790
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:39,667
He'll think he's a failure if
he couldn't get me a date.

791
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,085
I really can't.

792
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,004
I have a ton of work to do.

793
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,381
I see. Hang on a second.

794
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:47,799
Come here.

795
00:43:51,844 --> 00:43:55,972
Layla, if you don't come over
to Sonny's apartment tonight..

796
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:58,975
there's a good chance
I'll develop a stutter.

797
00:44:00,476 --> 00:44:03,687
P- P-P-Please don't
do this to me.

798
00:44:04,229 --> 00:44:06,648
- That is so cheap.
- What?

799
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:16,031
So I'm working in
a tollbooth now.

800
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,700
I originally wanted
to be a male model..

801
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:22,077
but I'm not very good-looking,
so that didn't work out.

802
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,745
I'm sorry to hear that.

803
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:25,705
I'm all right. I'm recovering.

804
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:28,624
This is my favorite part
of the song right here.

805
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,918
If I can't have you

806
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,130
Better keep it down low.
The kid's gonna wake up.

807
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,965
Too late.

808
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:40,217
Okay. Just hang
out a little bit.

809
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:43,261
I'll be right back.
Don't go sneaking out.

810
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:48,266
- What are you doing?
- You forgot to say good night.

811
00:44:48,516 --> 00:44:49,600
What do you mean?

812
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,477
I can't go to sleep until
you say good night.

813
00:44:52,728 --> 00:44:55,313
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.
Good night.

814
00:44:55,855 --> 00:44:57,440
Go to sleep now, all right?

815
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,066
What'd we learn about girls?

816
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:02,861
Initiating the conversation
is half the battle.

817
00:45:03,111 --> 00:45:05,363
Bingo. Now sleep, okay?

818
00:45:12,786 --> 00:45:15,955
I gave him Nyquil. He should
be out for the night.

819
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:20,667
This is Styx. They've been my
favorite band since I was 12.

820
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:22,002
You're kidding me.

821
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,962
No, I can't help it.
I just love them.

822
00:45:25,213 --> 00:45:26,964
My friends make fun of me.

823
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:30,509
My friends make fun of me too.
I've seen them 25 times.

824
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:33,469
Tommy Shaw, when I was 16,
I was at the concert..

825
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,971
and he reached down,
pulled me on stage.

826
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:38,515
I did the robot voice for "Mr.
Roboto."

827
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:39,516
Really?

828
00:45:39,766 --> 00:45:41,476
No, I made that up. I'm sorry.

829
00:45:41,726 --> 00:45:43,561
That would've been cool, right?

830
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:45,646
My cousin's friends
with their drummer..

831
00:45:45,896 --> 00:45:48,315
so when they come to
town, we go to dinner..

832
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:50,734
and they tell us
stories from the road.

833
00:45:50,984 --> 00:45:51,734
Really?

834
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:55,279
No, I made that up again too.
I'm sorry.

835
00:45:55,696 --> 00:45:59,241
You're not attracted to, like,
60-year-old guys, are you?

836
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:02,994
Yeah, I don't like them either.

837
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:07,456
I can't sleep.

838
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,001
He can't sleep.

839
00:46:12,251 --> 00:46:16,296
So the rabbit ran
across the street..

840
00:46:16,547 --> 00:46:19,632
because he thought
he saw some carrots.

841
00:46:19,883 --> 00:46:22,093
But when he got
across the street..

842
00:46:22,343 --> 00:46:25,262
it turned out they weren't
carrots, they were peanuts.

843
00:46:25,512 --> 00:46:27,305
Peanuts?

844
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:31,350
The peanuts belonged
to a squirrel..

845
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:34,812
who had taken them home
from a baseball game.

846
00:46:35,062 --> 00:46:37,897
And then the rabbit
thought to himself..

847
00:46:38,314 --> 00:46:40,358
"Carrots, peanuts,
what's the difference?"

848
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:43,902
So he asked the squirrel
if he could have some.

849
00:46:44,153 --> 00:46:46,113
And the squirrel
said, "Of course."

850
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:50,408
And the rabbit was very happy
to make such a nice new friend.

851
00:46:52,534 --> 00:46:54,453
And so was the squirrel.

852
00:46:54,703 --> 00:46:57,414
And the rabbit thought the
squirrel had pretty hair.

853
00:46:58,164 --> 00:47:00,583
And nice eyes also.

854
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:04,711
And the squirrel thought the
rabbit was really nice too.

855
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:08,464
And then, the rabbit
worked up his courage..

856
00:47:08,714 --> 00:47:10,966
and asked the squirrel
if he could have..

857
00:47:11,217 --> 00:47:13,885
just the littlest squirrel kiss.

858
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:18,556
And the squirrel thought it
just wasn't the right time..

859
00:47:18,806 --> 00:47:21,892
in her busy squirrel life
to be kissing any rabbits..

860
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:25,603
even though this particular
rabbit was very sweet.

861
00:47:26,104 --> 00:47:28,397
And the rabbit got
shut down, did he?

862
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:34,903
That's all right. But he
was still thinking maybe..

863
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,989
Scuba Steve could get
a squirrel kiss..

864
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,324
so somebody's getting
some action.

865
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,248
Good night, Scuba Steve.

866
00:47:50,082 --> 00:47:51,667
Good night, Frankenstein.

867
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:54,836
Good night, Sonny.

868
00:47:55,086 --> 00:47:56,712
Good night, Layla.

869
00:47:59,965 --> 00:48:01,758
Don't get caught with any girls.

870
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:04,135
It's your first day.
Take it slow.

871
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:07,346
I'll meet you after school
at 2:30, right out front.

872
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:09,056
You're not staying?

873
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:11,808
No, I gotta go get you
some more ketchup.

874
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:13,643
I don't like these kids.

875
00:48:13,893 --> 00:48:16,854
I don't either, but shouldn't
we give them a chance?

876
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:20,816
How's this?

877
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,444
Here are the magic sunglasses.

878
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:28,614
You put them on if you
feel scared, okay?

879
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,658
I lost you.

880
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,202
I don't know where you are.
I'm sorry.

881
00:48:35,494 --> 00:48:36,787
Oh, there you go.

882
00:48:38,288 --> 00:48:40,623
You go inside and
make some friends.

883
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:43,334
Oh, yeah, that's a good hug.

884
00:48:43,584 --> 00:48:46,378
All right. Go inside.
I'm gonna miss you.

885
00:48:50,006 --> 00:48:51,883
Hi, I like your hat.

886
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:53,676
What's your name?

887
00:49:05,853 --> 00:49:08,146
- Might as well..
- Leave a message!

888
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:11,691
- Might as well..
- Leave a message!

889
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:16,403
Mr. Gerrity, this is Arthur Brooks
from Social Services. I got good news.

890
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,822
We may have found a
family for Julian.

891
00:49:19,072 --> 00:49:21,449
Give me a call back
as soon as possible..

892
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:24,201
so we can set up a meeting. Bye.

893
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:36,670
Sierra Club Legal Department.

894
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,421
Can I speak to Layla Maloney?

895
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,090
Layla, line four.

896
00:49:44,009 --> 00:49:45,260
You're a lawyer?

897
00:49:45,552 --> 00:49:46,970
What are you doing?

898
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,556
Waiting for Julian so I can
have somebody to play with.

899
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,891
- What are you doing?
- I'm swamped.

900
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:55,227
I gotta do my laundry
on my lunch hour.

901
00:49:55,477 --> 00:49:58,479
I was gonna do my laundry today too.
Where are you going?

902
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,482
There's a place nearby,
Suds, on Bleecker.

903
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,568
I know that place. Maybe
I'll see you there then.

904
00:50:04,818 --> 00:50:07,153
Maybe. I gotta go.

905
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,164
I bought tickets, and the
show was the night before.

906
00:50:20,414 --> 00:50:21,331
Maybe it was a mistake.

907
00:50:21,582 --> 00:50:25,460
That's nice, but you don't know
what's going down on the streets.

908
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,587
It's hard to know
what's going down..

909
00:50:27,837 --> 00:50:31,340
when you're in an office seven
days a week, Mr. Tollbooth.

910
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:33,800
You're not gonna tell
me to get a real job.

911
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:36,135
No. You're a big boy.

912
00:50:36,385 --> 00:50:38,429
It's cool you only
work one day a week.

913
00:50:39,555 --> 00:50:42,140
These are the cutest
things I've ever seen.

914
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:43,183
I know.

915
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:46,102
I have them in yellow. I
wear them when I work out.

916
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,647
It's great what you're doing
with Julian while you got him.

917
00:50:51,106 --> 00:50:52,107
Yeah, well, I got him.

918
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:54,025
I read an article that said..

919
00:50:54,275 --> 00:50:57,528
the most important influences in
a kid's life are his friends.

920
00:50:57,778 --> 00:50:58,987
They said that?

921
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:03,449
Just hope he's not hanging out with
drug dealers and delinquents in school.

922
00:51:05,993 --> 00:51:07,077
I'm kidding.

923
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,663
I know. I know.

924
00:51:11,414 --> 00:51:14,333
Man, this Yoo-hoo is good.
You know what else is good?

925
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:16,168
Smoking dope.

926
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:18,086
I ain't going to rat you out.

927
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:19,546
Puffing the cheeba.

928
00:51:19,796 --> 00:51:23,591
Go by the seesaw, smoke a J. You
know what I'm talking about?

929
00:51:24,175 --> 00:51:25,634
I have a bellybutton.

930
00:51:25,926 --> 00:51:28,512
You have a bellybutton?
We all have bellybuttons.

931
00:51:28,762 --> 00:51:31,806
And we all love Yoo-hoo.
Especially with a little rum.

932
00:51:32,015 --> 00:51:32,890
What's rum?

933
00:51:33,141 --> 00:51:34,266
You don't know?

934
00:51:34,517 --> 00:51:35,601
Rumpelstiltskin?

935
00:51:37,811 --> 00:51:40,355
Rumpelstiltskin's a good man.
So are you guys.

936
00:51:41,314 --> 00:51:43,566
Stay clean. Stay focused.

937
00:51:43,816 --> 00:51:46,527
Frankenstein, have fun
with your friends.

938
00:51:48,153 --> 00:51:49,988
Why are you scratching so much?

939
00:51:50,238 --> 00:51:52,240
I have ecza..

940
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:53,908
Eczema? Gross.

941
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:55,784
How do I make it stop itching?

942
00:51:56,034 --> 00:51:58,453
I don't know. You scratch it.

943
00:51:58,703 --> 00:52:00,872
SpaghettiO's. Do you
like SpaghettiO's?

944
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,417
Dented cans are half price.

945
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:09,128
Microsoft went down three points.
We gotta save some money.

946
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:12,798
Here, give it a shot.

947
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:15,759
That's it, boy.

948
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:17,594
Put it in there. Feels good.

949
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:20,429
Hi, Sonny. Hi, Sonny's friend.

950
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,889
His name's Frankenstein.

951
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,974
Hi, Frankenstein. Remember me?

952
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,893
Help me. I'm lost. I
don't know where I am.

953
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,519
You don't gotta do that.

954
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,856
You guys wear the same size T-shirt.
That's cool.

955
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:34,274
I heard you did laundry
with my sister.

956
00:52:34,524 --> 00:52:35,817
She said we did laundry?

957
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:38,903
Where I'm from, it's called
doing the hibbity-dibbity.

958
00:52:40,696 --> 00:52:41,989
I got eczema.

959
00:52:42,364 --> 00:52:44,658
Well, then you
shouldn't scratch it.

960
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:47,577
Don't tell him what to do.
He can scratch.

961
00:52:47,827 --> 00:52:49,537
- Scratch.
- Is that better?

962
00:52:49,787 --> 00:52:51,580
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

963
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,791
You know about kids? I thought
you were a foot doctor.

964
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:59,170
It's not doctor stuff. It's common sense.
Scratching spreads rashes.

965
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,672
This is something you
learned at Hooters.

966
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:08,803
- What the hell is he doing?
- He's shopping.

967
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:11,513
Microsoft went
down three points.

968
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,516
That's good. See you
later, Frankenstein.

969
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:18,310
Stay away from the frozen-food section.
Your boobs'll harden.

970
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:28,360
Isn't Little Italy the greatest?

971
00:53:28,611 --> 00:53:32,739
I like it. Everyone always tells me
to hang out in the Village and SoHo.

972
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:33,907
That's all right.

973
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:38,327
But you gotta respect a place where
the fatter you are, the cooler you are.

974
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:46,292
Last time, he was with a different girl.
I guess he ate her.

975
00:53:48,669 --> 00:53:51,755
I went to Coney Island
today with the little boy.

976
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:54,173
You gotta take a look at this.

977
00:53:54,424 --> 00:53:56,383
We had a blast together.

978
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,594
He's so happy.

979
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:01,221
He is such a good boy.

980
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,974
If I have a kid of my own, I hope
he's half as cool as that kid.

981
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:06,976
Is he picking your nose?

982
00:54:07,393 --> 00:54:09,519
Yeah, he was picking
his own all day..

983
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:12,146
so I figured he could borrow mine.
- Sweet.

984
00:54:12,563 --> 00:54:14,857
He must be miserable
without you right now.

985
00:54:15,107 --> 00:54:16,567
No, he's in good hands.

986
00:54:18,443 --> 00:54:21,237
Look at Brad's body. Not
an ounce of fat on it.

987
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:24,281
- What?
- Don't worry. I like yours better.

988
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:29,703
I got two queens, two
jacks and an ace.

989
00:54:29,953 --> 00:54:31,537
- I win.
- Why do you win?

990
00:54:31,788 --> 00:54:35,708
I got a two, a four, a
ten, an eight and a six.

991
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:37,709
I don't understand.
Why do you win?

992
00:54:37,959 --> 00:54:40,253
- Because I win.
- What's the name of that game?

993
00:54:40,503 --> 00:54:41,295
I win.

994
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:42,838
I'll get it!

995
00:54:45,132 --> 00:54:47,384
- What's up?
- I'm looking for Kevin Gerrity.

996
00:54:47,634 --> 00:54:49,302
He's in China. Who are you?

997
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:53,097
Arthur Brooks, New York City
Social Services. I'm confused.

998
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:55,974
Chinatown. He loves
those egg rolls.

999
00:54:56,308 --> 00:55:00,228
I've tried contacting him several
times and he hasn't responded.

1000
00:55:00,478 --> 00:55:01,729
I'm concerned.

1001
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:03,772
Ixnay on the ketchupnay.

1002
00:55:04,022 --> 00:55:05,941
- Have him call me.
- All right.

1003
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,277
My body's definitely
better than his.

1004
00:55:09,527 --> 00:55:11,362
Without question.

1005
00:55:15,532 --> 00:55:19,285
It took you a long time to pencil me in.
You work all the time.

1006
00:55:19,535 --> 00:55:20,745
I know. I'm excited.

1007
00:55:20,995 --> 00:55:23,539
You're excited. How long
you been this crazy?

1008
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:27,834
I guess ever since I
was a little girl.

1009
00:55:28,626 --> 00:55:33,005
See, my mom got married really young
and pretty much just raised us kids.

1010
00:55:33,422 --> 00:55:35,090
So when my dad took off..

1011
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,800
she wasn't left with
a lot of options.

1012
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:41,053
And I think that's
when I decided..

1013
00:55:41,303 --> 00:55:43,889
that I never wanted to end
up in that situation.

1014
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:47,100
That's actually a good
reason to be working.

1015
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:51,145
I guess I feel like I gotta kick ass
while there's ass to be kicked.

1016
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:55,565
You kick that ass during the day, but
at night you have fun with Sonny.

1017
00:55:56,566 --> 00:56:00,861
The Best of Times

1018
00:56:02,154 --> 00:56:06,365
Are when I'm alone with you

1019
00:56:08,993 --> 00:56:12,829
Some rain, some shine

1020
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:25,381
Two guys you were best friends with in
law school fell in love with each other?

1021
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:26,966
Is that strange for you?

1022
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:29,134
No. Nothing changed, really.

1023
00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:32,679
They watch a different kind
of porno now. But that's it.

1024
00:56:35,348 --> 00:56:37,308
My God! This is Corinne's place?

1025
00:56:37,558 --> 00:56:40,143
If the girls at Hooters
could see her now.

1026
00:56:40,394 --> 00:56:44,522
- Do you want your ass kicked?
- I'm just kidding around, Layla.

1027
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:52,403
You're afraid to get involved and
you got a lot of work, but..

1028
00:56:52,987 --> 00:56:57,074
when I'm not with you, I'm thinking
of you. Do you have that going on?

1029
00:56:57,408 --> 00:56:58,408
Maybe.

1030
00:56:58,659 --> 00:57:01,161
Maybe we should try a kiss out.

1031
00:57:01,411 --> 00:57:05,748
We owe it to ourselves to see if
we should move to the next level.

1032
00:57:06,665 --> 00:57:08,125
I'm not sure.

1033
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:11,377
Me either. It's just that
you kissed Scuba Steve.

1034
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:14,213
Ever since then, he's
strutted around bragging..

1035
00:57:14,463 --> 00:57:18,717
"I got a kiss the first night. After
three times, you got nothing."

1036
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:20,176
- He said that?
- Come on.

1037
00:57:20,426 --> 00:57:23,763
Let's just give it a shot just
so I can have some dignity.

1038
00:57:24,013 --> 00:57:25,347
All right?

1039
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,438
Oh, my God!

1040
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:36,023
Gross!

1041
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:37,732
Did I witness the first kiss?

1042
00:57:37,983 --> 00:57:40,526
Yeah, you did. Thanks
a lot for showing up.

1043
00:57:41,194 --> 00:57:44,196
Layla, you didn't actually
enjoy that, did you?

1044
00:57:44,446 --> 00:57:46,990
I don't know. I'm
going upstairs.

1045
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,367
Wash your mouth out. He's dirty.

1046
00:57:49,617 --> 00:57:51,202
And he's poor.

1047
00:57:51,452 --> 00:57:55,455
What do you got in the bag, Corinne?
Some chicken wings? Booby tassels?

1048
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:56,706
Shut up.

1049
00:57:56,957 --> 00:57:58,416
You have a good sleep.

1050
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:00,251
Pleasant Hooters.

1051
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:06,715
Come on, come on!

1052
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,925
This is where we
hang our jackets.

1053
00:58:09,175 --> 00:58:10,301
This is my hook.

1054
00:58:10,551 --> 00:58:11,885
That's a capertillar.

1055
00:58:12,136 --> 00:58:13,262
A caterpillar.

1056
00:58:13,512 --> 00:58:16,890
- That's right, a capertillar.
- Capertillar, all right.

1057
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,724
- Staying clean, pal?
- Yes.

1058
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:21,935
You drink the booze, you lose.
Remember that, punk.

1059
00:58:23,562 --> 00:58:25,647
I'm Julian's teacher, Ms. Foote.

1060
00:58:25,897 --> 00:58:27,982
- You his father?
- I'm Kevin Gerrity.

1061
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:31,985
Do you have some time to go over some
things that have been bothering me?

1062
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:33,403
Sure.

1063
00:58:33,653 --> 00:58:35,447
Go take a walk, pal.

1064
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,741
Julian has been displaying
some odd behavior.

1065
00:58:38,991 --> 00:58:42,244
He spilled glue on the floor
and didn't tell anyone.

1066
00:58:42,494 --> 00:58:44,120
He covered it with newspaper.

1067
00:58:44,913 --> 00:58:49,291
And then one of our students wore
Rollerblades for show-and-tell.

1068
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:52,085
And Julian tripped
him with a stick.

1069
00:58:52,419 --> 00:58:53,420
I've never..

1070
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:57,923
Julian found it hilarious.

1071
00:58:58,174 --> 00:59:00,509
I like him to express
himself freely.

1072
00:59:00,759 --> 00:59:03,762
I've really never seen
any problems with that.

1073
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:10,934
Your boy's making the least
progress of any of the children.

1074
00:59:11,518 --> 00:59:15,229
Frankly, his personal hygiene is
becoming a cause for concern.

1075
00:59:15,688 --> 00:59:19,108
He's the smelly kid in class? I
let him become the smelly kid?

1076
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:20,525
What's wrong with me?

1077
00:59:20,776 --> 00:59:22,694
I've had some
smelly ones before.

1078
00:59:22,944 --> 00:59:25,321
But your son is by
far the smelliest.

1079
00:59:25,571 --> 00:59:28,365
All right, I got you. What
do you think I should do?

1080
00:59:28,615 --> 00:59:31,284
Start by paying more
attention to his schoolwork.

1081
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:35,329
The class is giving a presentation
of the Founding Fathers.

1082
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:39,666
Julian has drawn the part of Benjamin
Franklin, a very important role.

1083
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:41,126
Do what you can to help.

1084
00:59:41,376 --> 00:59:44,086
I will turn this all around.
That's a promise.

1085
00:59:44,337 --> 00:59:45,713
Thank you very much.

1086
00:59:45,963 --> 00:59:48,382
Stinky, let's go. You
got us in trouble.

1087
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:49,925
Did he call him "Stinky"?

1088
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:56,013
Wow, I didn't know this
about George Washington.

1089
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:58,640
Yes, his teeth
were made of wool.

1090
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,475
Wood.

1091
01:00:01,392 --> 01:00:03,144
I sorry. I mix up "D" and "L."

1092
01:00:03,394 --> 01:00:04,603
Well, get it right.

1093
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:08,023
Turn that game off, pal.

1094
01:00:08,273 --> 01:00:09,566
I got four guys left.

1095
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:11,317
Let's study a little bit.

1096
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:12,735
I don't wanna study.

1097
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:13,944
Give me that.

1098
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:17,948
- You just killed me.
- So what? You'll play later.

1099
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,782
You can't tell me what to do.

1100
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:23,953
Really? Let's take a vote. Who
thinks the kid should study?

1101
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:28,456
Who doesn't? Well, you
just lost, two to one.

1102
01:00:28,706 --> 01:00:31,959
It's a tie. That guy doesn't count.
He can't even read.

1103
01:00:33,335 --> 01:00:35,379
I know. He was just
joking around.

1104
01:00:36,171 --> 01:00:39,674
Can you hang out here a little bit?
I gotta go do something.

1105
01:00:39,924 --> 01:00:41,092
No problem.

1106
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:43,844
Would you like

1107
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:47,722
We'll hop, hop, hop, hop

1108
01:00:47,972 --> 01:00:49,682
What do you say

1109
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:52,810
Get the door.

1110
01:00:59,649 --> 01:01:01,275
Hi, Julian. How you doing?

1111
01:01:01,942 --> 01:01:03,652
I'm Scuba Sam.

1112
01:01:03,902 --> 01:01:05,487
Scuba Steve's father.

1113
01:01:05,737 --> 01:01:07,030
You see, my boy..

1114
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,990
needs to take a bath.

1115
01:01:09,407 --> 01:01:10,866
The only problem is..

1116
01:01:11,116 --> 01:01:13,118
he's afraid to bathe alone.

1117
01:01:13,368 --> 01:01:14,911
So I was wondering..

1118
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:18,664
if maybe you could keep
him company in the tub.

1119
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:20,374
Terrific.

1120
01:01:20,749 --> 01:01:23,710
And after the bath, you
have to try and study hard.

1121
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,673
Because if you wanna be a member of the
Scuba Squad, you have to be smart.

1122
01:01:28,964 --> 01:01:31,008
I could be in the Scuba Squad?

1123
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:34,719
Well, sure. All you have
to do is work hard.

1124
01:01:34,969 --> 01:01:37,555
And don't tell a soul
about the Scuba Squad..

1125
01:01:37,805 --> 01:01:39,973
because then everybody
will wanna join.

1126
01:01:40,224 --> 01:01:41,683
And one more thing..

1127
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:44,185
be nice to the delivery
guy, would you?

1128
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,271
It's not his fault
he can't read.

1129
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:49,815
Take care.

1130
01:01:53,818 --> 01:01:57,446
He told me to watch his boat for him.
Said that he wanted to..

1131
01:01:57,696 --> 01:02:00,365
talk to you about
some secret mission.

1132
01:02:00,782 --> 01:02:03,284
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1133
01:02:06,495 --> 01:02:08,831
How come I have to
wear a bathing suit?

1134
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:10,582
I don't know the rules..

1135
01:02:10,832 --> 01:02:15,086
with little kids and grownups and
being naked and just sit down.

1136
01:02:17,421 --> 01:02:20,799
The good news is you're not
smelling like a foot anymore.

1137
01:02:21,049 --> 01:02:24,802
I read something interesting. You
know Benjamin Franklin invented..

1138
01:02:25,052 --> 01:02:27,054
bifocals? That's pretty cool.

1139
01:02:27,304 --> 01:02:28,263
What are they?

1140
01:02:28,513 --> 01:02:32,558
I'll show you in that book. It might
help you out with your school play.

1141
01:02:33,434 --> 01:02:35,061
We'll make this a regular thing.

1142
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:38,438
Bathing and studying
and eating right.

1143
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:41,316
Put your head back. My
grandmother did this to me.

1144
01:02:41,566 --> 01:02:46,320
"Oh, boy. When I was a little girl,
frankfurters only cost a nickel."

1145
01:02:46,653 --> 01:02:47,779
Can you still have fun?

1146
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,698
Yeah, but after you study.

1147
01:02:49,948 --> 01:02:52,950
In fact, we gotta get you
dressing differently.

1148
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,743
We'll go to Barney's.

1149
01:02:55,661 --> 01:02:58,622
Not that Barney. A
more expensive Barney.

1150
01:03:08,296 --> 01:03:10,048
All right, one at a time.

1151
01:03:10,298 --> 01:03:11,799
That's one.

1152
01:03:12,216 --> 01:03:13,509
Two.

1153
01:03:15,344 --> 01:03:17,887
See? Urinals are good too.

1154
01:03:38,655 --> 01:03:40,072
"Electricity."

1155
01:03:40,406 --> 01:03:41,323
Very good.

1156
01:03:41,574 --> 01:03:42,741
"Constitution."

1157
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:44,159
That's it.

1158
01:03:44,409 --> 01:03:45,619
"Philadelphia."

1159
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:46,995
Smart. Good.

1160
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:50,790
"Fish"?

1161
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,126
"Pony"?

1162
01:03:56,127 --> 01:03:57,086
"Hip.."

1163
01:03:58,254 --> 01:03:59,046
"Hiphop.."

1164
01:03:59,797 --> 01:04:00,881
"Hipopynonamous"?

1165
01:04:02,508 --> 01:04:05,343
Damn you! You gave
him the easy ones!

1166
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,306
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.

1167
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:14,934
Slow down.

1168
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,478
You owe me a Sausage McMuffin.

1169
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:26,903
There's a pole there.

1170
01:04:36,494 --> 01:04:38,579
My name is Alexander Hamilton.

1171
01:04:38,912 --> 01:04:41,623
I was the first secretary
of the treasury.

1172
01:04:41,873 --> 01:04:44,250
I owned a bank and a newspaper.

1173
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,794
Aaron Bird shot me.

1174
01:04:50,839 --> 01:04:53,258
Hi, my name is
Benjamin Franklin.

1175
01:04:53,633 --> 01:04:56,218
I was a writer, a diplomat..

1176
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,720
an inventor and a statesman..

1177
01:04:58,971 --> 01:05:02,891
although I only went to
school for two years.

1178
01:05:04,183 --> 01:05:08,520
I wrote many books and invented
many things we still use today.

1179
01:05:13,316 --> 01:05:16,944
The Declaration of
Independence is finished.

1180
01:05:18,654 --> 01:05:20,280
Who will be the first to sign?

1181
01:05:20,572 --> 01:05:23,950
- How about you, John Hancock?
- I want to sign!

1182
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:30,872
- Look at my man stand strong.
- He's so cute.

1183
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:37,919
What are your cards?

1184
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:42,882
I got a six, a five, a
jack, a four and a eight.

1185
01:05:43,341 --> 01:05:44,175
I win.

1186
01:05:44,425 --> 01:05:45,342
What do you mean?

1187
01:05:45,592 --> 01:05:47,928
I had a hand just like that.
I didn't win.

1188
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:49,095
Because I win.

1189
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,638
This is bullshit!

1190
01:05:50,888 --> 01:05:52,515
All right. Take it easy, man.

1191
01:05:52,765 --> 01:05:54,433
Every time it's different cards.

1192
01:05:54,683 --> 01:05:56,143
So what? Relax. He's a kid.

1193
01:05:56,601 --> 01:05:59,854
There should be same set of
rules, no matter what age.

1194
01:06:00,104 --> 01:06:02,148
He's gotta learn
how to lose too.

1195
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,942
- Hello, Mr. Koufax.
- Mr. Brooks, how you doing?

1196
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:06,902
I was gonna give you a buzz.

1197
01:06:07,944 --> 01:06:10,655
You just called me
Mr. Koufax, didn't you?

1198
01:06:10,905 --> 01:06:12,948
It is your name, isn't it?
Sonny Koufax?

1199
01:06:13,198 --> 01:06:15,701
You held yourself out
to be Kevin Gerrity..

1200
01:06:15,951 --> 01:06:17,911
to gain custody of young Julian.

1201
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:19,954
Big problem in this state.

1202
01:06:20,204 --> 01:06:21,914
I've delivered to you before.

1203
01:06:22,164 --> 01:06:24,541
You always order three
pieces of cheesecake.

1204
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:28,127
The real Kevin Gerrity
asked me to take care of..

1205
01:06:28,378 --> 01:06:30,171
Save it, Mr. Koufax.

1206
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:32,756
He has to come with me
or I'll arrest you.

1207
01:06:33,006 --> 01:06:34,257
Take out your handcuffs.

1208
01:06:34,508 --> 01:06:37,343
I don't have any, but two
policemen downstairs do.

1209
01:06:37,844 --> 01:06:40,096
Listen, Sonny, I
would like to help..

1210
01:06:40,346 --> 01:06:44,099
but my status in your country is
not what you would call legal.

1211
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:45,433
It's okay.

1212
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:46,893
I'm Audi.

1213
01:06:47,143 --> 01:06:49,937
Julian, you're gonna
have to come with me.

1214
01:06:52,022 --> 01:06:53,648
One second, pal.

1215
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:59,028
Would you just give me a second
to say goodbye to the kid?

1216
01:07:00,154 --> 01:07:01,155
Take a second.

1217
01:07:09,453 --> 01:07:11,788
You don't want me here anymore?

1218
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,915
No, that's not it, pal.

1219
01:07:14,165 --> 01:07:16,375
You just gotta go away
for a little while.

1220
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:19,086
How long am I going away for?

1221
01:07:19,336 --> 01:07:21,296
I don't wanna lie to you.

1222
01:07:23,631 --> 01:07:25,383
I don't think we're gonna..

1223
01:07:25,883 --> 01:07:28,010
be seeing each other anymore.

1224
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:32,347
I screwed up, pal. I'm so sorry.

1225
01:07:33,306 --> 01:07:34,599
Come here.

1226
01:07:35,308 --> 01:07:36,475
Put your coat on.

1227
01:07:42,272 --> 01:07:44,690
It's not your fault, okay?
I'm the idiot.

1228
01:07:44,941 --> 01:07:47,026
- I don't wanna go.
- I know you don't.

1229
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:49,695
But you have to, and
you're gonna be okay.

1230
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,782
Please don't make me go.

1231
01:07:55,032 --> 01:07:57,409
I'm sorry, but I don't
know what else to do.

1232
01:07:57,659 --> 01:08:00,120
I won't play the
kangaroo song anymore.

1233
01:08:00,704 --> 01:08:02,038
Come on.

1234
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:03,915
Just go. You gotta go.

1235
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:05,374
You gotta go.

1236
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:09,628
I don't wanna go. I promise..

1237
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:12,839
I'm sorry. I don't even
like that song anymore.

1238
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,090
I know, pal. That's not it.

1239
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:18,510
But I wipe my own ass!
I wipe my own ass!

1240
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:21,679
I know.

1241
01:08:40,862 --> 01:08:43,197
- Layla, they took the kid.
- Who?

1242
01:08:43,447 --> 01:08:45,949
Social Services. I
gotta get him back.

1243
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:47,993
You said this was
just temporary.

1244
01:08:48,243 --> 01:08:51,078
I can't have it be temporary.
It's gotta be permanent.

1245
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:53,038
Okay, what can we do?

1246
01:08:53,289 --> 01:08:56,625
I filed to get custody based
on the child's best interests.

1247
01:08:56,875 --> 01:09:00,628
Tommy knew a clerk, so they
fast-tracked the hearing. It's Tuesday.

1248
01:09:00,878 --> 01:09:02,713
- This Tuesday?
- You got work?

1249
01:09:02,963 --> 01:09:05,966
I gotta go to Washington for a
hearing to dismiss my case.

1250
01:09:06,216 --> 01:09:07,759
Can you get somebody else?

1251
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:10,428
I'm sorry, Sonny. I can't.
It's my case.

1252
01:09:10,678 --> 01:09:13,805
We don't even know where
this kid's gonna end up.

1253
01:09:14,056 --> 01:09:17,475
Sonny, this is exactly why I
didn't wanna get involved.

1254
01:09:17,725 --> 01:09:19,685
I had things going
the way I wanted.

1255
01:09:19,936 --> 01:09:23,730
Then at the park, you and this
kid come barging into my life..

1256
01:09:23,981 --> 01:09:26,941
and it's screwing up
everything I had planned.

1257
01:09:27,192 --> 01:09:30,111
You think I planned on a kid
showing up on my doorstep?

1258
01:09:30,361 --> 01:09:31,904
But I fell in love with him.

1259
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:35,240
So now my plans have changed.

1260
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:31,703
All rise.

1261
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:42,962
We're here to determine proper
custody of Julian McGrath..

1262
01:10:43,212 --> 01:10:46,340
also known as Julian
Gerrity, a minor child.

1263
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,133
Representing New York City?

1264
01:10:48,383 --> 01:10:49,759
Ted Castellucci.

1265
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,845
Arthur Brooks, Social Services.

1266
01:10:52,095 --> 01:10:54,013
And representing Sonny Koufax?

1267
01:10:54,263 --> 01:10:55,347
Phillip D'Amato.

1268
01:10:55,598 --> 01:10:56,598
Thomas Grayton.

1269
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,476
Plus, I'll pretty much
be representing myself.

1270
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:00,685
Anyone else?

1271
01:11:00,935 --> 01:11:03,187
Layla Maloney, Your Honor.

1272
01:11:06,857 --> 01:11:08,900
Does this mean that you love me?

1273
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:10,652
Something like that.

1274
01:11:11,527 --> 01:11:12,987
First witness.

1275
01:11:13,237 --> 01:11:15,906
Koufax is a good egg. He
was nice to that kid.

1276
01:11:16,782 --> 01:11:18,867
But he fights like a girl.

1277
01:11:19,117 --> 01:11:19,951
You like that?

1278
01:11:20,201 --> 01:11:21,911
I'm right here, miss.

1279
01:11:22,161 --> 01:11:23,954
What are you gonna do about it?

1280
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:27,499
Are you drunk, Mr. Herlihy?

1281
01:11:27,749 --> 01:11:30,376
I had a few chardonnays.
What of it?

1282
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:32,503
Get off the stand.

1283
01:11:33,003 --> 01:11:34,296
You got it.

1284
01:11:34,838 --> 01:11:36,340
I've got a few problems.

1285
01:11:36,798 --> 01:11:38,008
Off to a good start.

1286
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:43,053
Mr. Koufax is a really cool guy. I
wish my dad was as cool as him.

1287
01:11:43,304 --> 01:11:44,972
My dad was a military man.

1288
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:48,808
Guess I wasn't such
a "good soldier."

1289
01:11:49,225 --> 01:11:54,021
When I was 35, he attempted to give
me a crew cut while I was sleeping.

1290
01:11:54,313 --> 01:11:56,773
I broke his arm, haven't
seen him since.

1291
01:11:57,357 --> 01:12:00,276
I'd rather live on the streets
than under his rules.

1292
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,285
Anyway, I think Mr. Koufax should
be acquitted of all the charges.

1293
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:16,331
If O.J. can get away with murder,
why can't Sonny have his kid?

1294
01:12:17,749 --> 01:12:19,834
This guy knows what
I'm talking about.

1295
01:12:22,044 --> 01:12:23,837
No more questions.

1296
01:12:27,382 --> 01:12:29,967
How long have you delivered
food to Mr. Koufax?

1297
01:12:30,217 --> 01:12:31,885
I deliver food for six years.

1298
01:12:32,135 --> 01:12:35,138
Plus, I'm stripper. But I've
put on weight so it's problem.

1299
01:12:35,388 --> 01:12:39,475
I see. And in your experience, was
Sonny a good father to Julian?

1300
01:12:39,725 --> 01:12:42,394
Oh, yes. They make
terrific pair.

1301
01:12:42,644 --> 01:12:45,104
They went together like
lamb and tuna fish.

1302
01:12:46,898 --> 01:12:48,482
Lamb and tuna fish?

1303
01:12:49,108 --> 01:12:52,652
Spaghetti and meatball? You more
comfortable with that analogy?

1304
01:12:52,903 --> 01:12:55,113
Yes, considering
we're in America.

1305
01:12:55,363 --> 01:12:57,948
If you don't like spaghetti
and meatballs, get out.

1306
01:12:58,199 --> 01:12:59,658
I'll come give you a crew cut.

1307
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:01,284
Let's see your clippers.

1308
01:13:01,535 --> 01:13:03,328
Not my problem
your dad was sick.

1309
01:13:05,705 --> 01:13:07,248
Stop yelling at me!

1310
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:12,877
Order! Order! Order!

1311
01:13:13,128 --> 01:13:14,629
Am I in the right room?

1312
01:13:14,879 --> 01:13:15,963
Who the hell are you?

1313
01:13:16,213 --> 01:13:17,881
I'm Mr. Koufax's co-counsel.

1314
01:13:18,132 --> 01:13:19,800
He has enough co-counsels.

1315
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:20,884
Well..

1316
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:24,178
one more won't hurt.

1317
01:13:24,428 --> 01:13:25,805
Let's get on with it.

1318
01:13:26,055 --> 01:13:29,057
Mr. Koufax is simply parading
his buddies up there.

1319
01:13:29,308 --> 01:13:31,684
Can't they find someone
who isn't a friend?

1320
01:13:31,935 --> 01:13:34,187
What were Julian and
Mr. Koufax doing?

1321
01:13:34,562 --> 01:13:35,396
Shopping.

1322
01:13:35,646 --> 01:13:38,482
Did he appear to be an
attentive, loving father?

1323
01:13:38,732 --> 01:13:40,191
He certainly did.

1324
01:13:40,525 --> 01:13:42,735
And how long have you
disliked Mr. Koufax?

1325
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,195
Since the day I met him.

1326
01:13:44,445 --> 01:13:47,531
For the record, where did you
work during medical school?

1327
01:13:49,032 --> 01:13:50,367
Hooters.

1328
01:13:52,243 --> 01:13:53,995
No further questions.

1329
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:56,371
Asshole.

1330
01:13:56,622 --> 01:13:57,873
Next witness.

1331
01:13:58,498 --> 01:14:00,500
We'd like to call
Julian McGrath.

1332
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:17,764
If it's okay with you, I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

1333
01:14:18,098 --> 01:14:19,849
This is just you
and me talking..

1334
01:14:20,099 --> 01:14:22,143
so don't pay attention
to these people.

1335
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:24,436
Can you tell me how old you are?

1336
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,856
Your Honor, one second.

1337
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:42,618
That's better, huh?

1338
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:44,536
Can you tell me how old you are?

1339
01:14:44,911 --> 01:14:46,079
Five.

1340
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:47,622
What's your birthday?

1341
01:14:47,872 --> 01:14:49,540
July 15th.

1342
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:50,875
Where were you born?

1343
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,167
Toronto.

1344
01:14:52,418 --> 01:14:54,836
Toronto? I thought you
were from Buffalo.

1345
01:14:55,253 --> 01:14:57,922
I moved to Buffalo
with my mommy.

1346
01:14:58,172 --> 01:15:01,258
For the past six weeks, you've
been living with Sonny?

1347
01:15:03,343 --> 01:15:04,970
Did you and Sonny have fun?

1348
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:08,097
What kind of things
would you do?

1349
01:15:08,347 --> 01:15:12,267
He taught me how to do the sleeper
hold like Chief Jay Strongbow.

1350
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:14,102
That's nice.

1351
01:15:14,352 --> 01:15:15,395
Anything else?

1352
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:17,939
He taught me how to
pee on a building.

1353
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:19,482
Really?

1354
01:15:23,193 --> 01:15:27,738
And he taught me that Styx was one
of the greatest American rock bands.

1355
01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:29,740
They only caught a bad rap..

1356
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:33,451
because most critics
are cynical assholes.

1357
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,164
I think we'd all
agree with that.

1358
01:15:40,124 --> 01:15:44,586
Before you came here, do you remember
the last thing your mommy said to you?

1359
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:48,380
That she loved me and I was
gonna live with my new daddy.

1360
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:51,508
If your mother could pick
anyone to be your new daddy..

1361
01:15:51,758 --> 01:15:53,009
who would she pick?

1362
01:15:53,259 --> 01:15:54,844
Sonny.

1363
01:15:55,803 --> 01:15:57,012
Thank you, Julian.

1364
01:15:57,263 --> 01:15:58,639
You can step down now.

1365
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:05,311
That went good, don't you think?

1366
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:08,564
I don't know. Judge
doesn't look too happy.

1367
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,274
Mr. Koufax, anyone else?

1368
01:16:16,028 --> 01:16:18,363
I'd like to call upon
myself, Your Honor.

1369
01:16:18,614 --> 01:16:19,823
Awesome.

1370
01:16:20,073 --> 01:16:23,201
Which of your esteemed
co-counsels will examine you?

1371
01:16:25,161 --> 01:16:27,496
My father, Lenny Koufax.

1372
01:16:27,746 --> 01:16:28,872
What?

1373
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:30,707
Forget it, Sonny.

1374
01:16:30,957 --> 01:16:32,375
What is going on?

1375
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:36,879
Nobody in this world thinks I shouldn't
have a child more than that man.

1376
01:16:37,254 --> 01:16:40,715
He also happens to be a
well-respected lawyer in Florida.

1377
01:16:40,965 --> 01:16:45,094
If I can make a believer out of him, I
can make a believer out of everybody.

1378
01:16:45,344 --> 01:16:49,848
This court is after the truth, not the
opinion of the defendant's father.

1379
01:16:50,098 --> 01:16:52,433
You want my opinion?
My son is a moron.

1380
01:16:52,683 --> 01:16:55,060
I withdraw my objection.
Please proceed.

1381
01:17:00,064 --> 01:17:01,691
This is a big mistake.

1382
01:17:02,191 --> 01:17:05,611
I only came today to make sure
you didn't end up in jail.

1383
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:07,654
That was nice of you. Thank you.

1384
01:17:07,904 --> 01:17:10,740
To do what I think
is right here.

1385
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,492
Cut your fingernails.
They're too long.

1386
01:17:13,742 --> 01:17:14,701
Okay, Dad.

1387
01:17:14,952 --> 01:17:16,328
This case is simple.

1388
01:17:17,495 --> 01:17:22,041
It is absurd to think that Sonny
Koufax is ready to raise a child.

1389
01:17:22,291 --> 01:17:23,959
- Objection!
- Shut up, Tommy.

1390
01:17:24,585 --> 01:17:26,127
Sorry, Mr. Koufax.

1391
01:17:26,711 --> 01:17:28,504
First of all, how did..

1392
01:17:28,755 --> 01:17:33,342
this sweet little boy, Julian,
end up under your supervision?

1393
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:37,595
I told Social Services that
my name was Kevin Gerrity.

1394
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:40,222
- Of course, you are not Kevin Gerrity.
- No.

1395
01:17:40,473 --> 01:17:41,974
- So you lied.
- Yes.

1396
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:45,185
Like the time I found a bag
of pot in your drawer..

1397
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:48,271
and you said you thought
they were pencil shavings.

1398
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:53,900
Remember when I told you Aunt
Fay was coming to New York..

1399
01:17:54,151 --> 01:17:56,361
and I wanted you to
show her the city?

1400
01:17:56,611 --> 01:17:59,071
And you said that you had
better things to do.

1401
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:00,406
That's right.

1402
01:18:00,656 --> 01:18:04,576
I'm curious. Just what were those
better things that you had to do?

1403
01:18:06,828 --> 01:18:10,914
Jethro Tull had a reunion concert
in New Jersey, so I caught that.

1404
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:15,376
What happened to Aunt
Fay that weekend?

1405
01:18:16,252 --> 01:18:17,253
She died.

1406
01:18:17,503 --> 01:18:18,462
Yes, she did.

1407
01:18:19,922 --> 01:18:22,424
Did you happen to make
it to her funeral?

1408
01:18:24,217 --> 01:18:25,134
Why not?

1409
01:18:25,385 --> 01:18:29,221
I went to Jones Beach, got
drunk and fell asleep.

1410
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,472
Hell, yes!

1411
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:32,974
Some role model.

1412
01:18:34,934 --> 01:18:36,269
Your Honor..

1413
01:18:36,936 --> 01:18:38,979
my son doesn't have
health insurance.

1414
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:41,148
He doesn't know how
to boil an egg.

1415
01:18:41,398 --> 01:18:44,942
He filed for social
security at the age of 30.

1416
01:18:45,568 --> 01:18:48,445
He is a drain on the
economy, on the country..

1417
01:18:48,695 --> 01:18:50,447
and most of all, on me!

1418
01:18:52,949 --> 01:18:53,908
Your Honor..

1419
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:56,452
to give this young man..

1420
01:18:57,619 --> 01:19:01,456
custody over another
life is not only wrong..

1421
01:19:01,748 --> 01:19:02,874
it's insane.

1422
01:19:10,797 --> 01:19:11,881
I love you.

1423
01:19:12,674 --> 01:19:13,424
What?

1424
01:19:13,966 --> 01:19:16,093
Don't be scared. It's all right.

1425
01:19:16,343 --> 01:19:17,719
I'm not scared.

1426
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:21,055
If I get custody of Julian,
I'll be his father forever.

1427
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:25,100
That scares you because you think
there's a good chance I'll fail.

1428
01:19:25,351 --> 01:19:29,271
Sonny, it's more than a chance.
It's a certainty.

1429
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:30,730
You're wrong, Dad.

1430
01:19:31,189 --> 01:19:35,442
You can be scared that I might get
pickpocketed in a bad neighborhood..

1431
01:19:35,693 --> 01:19:37,569
or break my legs skiing.

1432
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:41,614
But don't be scared about me being
a dad, because I will not fail.

1433
01:19:42,073 --> 01:19:43,783
I love this kid too much.

1434
01:19:44,033 --> 01:19:46,493
I love him as much
as you love me, Dad.

1435
01:19:46,827 --> 01:19:49,412
I'm gonna give him advice
and I'm gonna guide him..

1436
01:19:49,662 --> 01:19:51,831
and I'll be there
whenever he needs me.

1437
01:19:52,206 --> 01:19:54,958
I'll fly to New York to
be at his court case..

1438
01:19:55,209 --> 01:19:58,086
even if I disagree
with why he's there.

1439
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:01,714
But, Sonny, you work
in a tollbooth.

1440
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,299
Don't worry about money.

1441
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:06,718
I am in love with a beautiful
girl who makes plenty of it.

1442
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,262
She'll be my sugar mama.

1443
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:12,139
I gotta get me one of those.

1444
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:16,893
I know this is the right thing
because I would die for this kid..

1445
01:20:17,143 --> 01:20:19,604
just so he won't feel
one ounce of sadness.

1446
01:20:19,854 --> 01:20:24,191
That's why you're here right now, to
protect me, to be scared for me..

1447
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:26,484
to be a good father.

1448
01:20:27,485 --> 01:20:29,779
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna be.

1449
01:20:34,408 --> 01:20:35,992
Hello, Dad?

1450
01:20:36,409 --> 01:20:38,703
Yeah, I just wanted
to say I love you.

1451
01:20:39,036 --> 01:20:42,414
Hi, Mom? Could you put Dad
on the phone for a second?

1452
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,752
Can I borrow that
when you're done?

1453
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:50,045
Your Honor..

1454
01:20:51,422 --> 01:20:53,173
my son deserves this kid.

1455
01:21:05,225 --> 01:21:06,893
I love you too, sir.

1456
01:21:08,894 --> 01:21:10,521
Mr. Koufax..

1457
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:13,481
the fact is you
kidnapped this child.

1458
01:21:13,732 --> 01:21:15,525
Not only shouldn't
you get custody..

1459
01:21:15,775 --> 01:21:18,861
but since you obtained him
by defrauding the state..

1460
01:21:19,111 --> 01:21:21,113
you should be in jail.

1461
01:21:21,446 --> 01:21:24,907
Bailiff, remand him until I can
figure out the punishment.

1462
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:27,076
Wait. You can't take him away.

1463
01:21:28,911 --> 01:21:31,663
As that boy's father, I
refuse to press charges.

1464
01:21:33,998 --> 01:21:36,625
Oh, God. Corinne, I'm sorry.

1465
01:21:36,876 --> 01:21:39,336
Six years ago, Joe Carter..

1466
01:21:39,586 --> 01:21:40,670
Joe Carter?

1467
01:21:40,921 --> 01:21:43,172
Toronto and the Phillies.
World Series.

1468
01:21:43,631 --> 01:21:46,050
Mitch Williams.. We
flew up for the night.

1469
01:21:47,676 --> 01:21:49,219
There was a girl.

1470
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:50,387
Oh, God.

1471
01:21:50,637 --> 01:21:53,056
I'm an idiot. I was so hammered.

1472
01:21:53,306 --> 01:21:56,475
Chicken wings, Molson 3-0.
Canadian beer is like moonshine.

1473
01:21:56,725 --> 01:21:57,851
Hell, yes.

1474
01:21:58,101 --> 01:22:00,478
You remember? It was at
that Toronto Hooters.

1475
01:22:03,106 --> 01:22:07,025
That was before he met you. That
Hooters thing is a coincidence.

1476
01:22:07,276 --> 01:22:08,610
I'm sorry, Corinne.

1477
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:12,780
I know this changes everything,
but I had to do the right thing.

1478
01:22:14,865 --> 01:22:16,200
Mr. Castellucci.

1479
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,370
Pending a blood test, I..

1480
01:22:20,578 --> 01:22:21,537
Whatever.

1481
01:22:21,788 --> 01:22:26,625
The court grants custody to Kevin
Gerrity, pending the DNA test results.

1482
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:34,590
I want you to be my dad, Sonny.

1483
01:22:35,007 --> 01:22:36,925
I know. I do too, pal.

1484
01:22:37,175 --> 01:22:41,262
But I'm not sure that can happen
exactly the way we want it.

1485
01:22:41,512 --> 01:22:44,348
Because it seems you
already have a daddy.

1486
01:22:44,807 --> 01:22:46,850
But I'll tell you what I can do.

1487
01:22:47,142 --> 01:22:50,520
I can be your friend, no matter what.
All right?

1488
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,480
I'll always be your friend.

1489
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:55,482
I'll always be your family.
I'll always be around.

1490
01:22:55,816 --> 01:22:57,400
I promise.

1491
01:22:57,692 --> 01:22:59,527
The kid's good at
tying his shoes.

1492
01:22:59,777 --> 01:23:01,779
He's not great at it,
so work with him.

1493
01:23:02,029 --> 01:23:04,740
- I'll teach him bunny ears.
- What's bunny ears?

1494
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:07,408
Make bunny ears, cross
and pull them through.

1495
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:11,120
I go with this loop, swoop and pull thing.
He likes that.

1496
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:14,206
- I don't know that.
- Go with the loop, swoop and pull.

1497
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:16,166
I swear to God it's working.

1498
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:17,625
All right.

1499
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:22,337
Go with the bunny ears thing.
You're his dad, right? I'm sorry.

1500
01:23:22,588 --> 01:23:25,173
It's important, when you
eat at my restaurant..

1501
01:23:25,423 --> 01:23:27,550
you never order BLT.

1502
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,427
You must trust me. Stay
away from BLT, okay?

1503
01:23:30,678 --> 01:23:31,762
Hey, guys.

1504
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:34,472
I'm gonna leave you with
your dad now, Julian.

1505
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:37,266
He's a good man. I've
known him my whole life.

1506
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:40,394
So you two have fun and I'll
see you in the morning.

1507
01:23:40,644 --> 01:23:41,770
All right?

1508
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:45,231
- Quit scaring the kid for a minute.
- Who am I scaring?

1509
01:23:45,482 --> 01:23:47,024
Bye, pal.

1510
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:54,030
I went to China. Do you
know where that is?

1511
01:23:54,364 --> 01:23:55,782
It's in Asia, which is..

1512
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:58,742
by Europe. I brought
some cool stuff back.

1513
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,581
Did you move the bench?

1514
01:24:06,457 --> 01:24:07,541
That's pretty funny.

1515
01:24:08,751 --> 01:24:11,962
You know what I got? Some noisemakers.
Check this out.

1516
01:24:13,129 --> 01:24:14,547
Wanna try one?

1517
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,720
That's my foot!

1518
01:24:44,697 --> 01:24:46,073
You're nice man.

1519
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:49,576
I've got Spice Channel.
It's blurry but it's nice.

1520
01:24:52,245 --> 01:24:54,372
Let's make this quick.
I gotta get to work.

1521
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:57,374
Holy shit. Sonny Koufax
would rather work than eat.

1522
01:24:57,624 --> 01:25:01,836
I'm working on a big case. I gotta
sue you for making me come here.

1523
01:25:05,256 --> 01:25:06,965
Surprise!

1524
01:25:09,676 --> 01:25:12,470
Did you just waste the
good surprise on me again?

1525
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:15,889
Hi, Corinne.

1526
01:25:16,139 --> 01:25:18,391
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, everybody.

1527
01:25:18,642 --> 01:25:20,351
Hey, you guys. How are you?

1528
01:25:20,601 --> 01:25:22,478
Happy birthday, Daddy.

1529
01:25:23,938 --> 01:25:25,189
How you doing, cutie?

1530
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:28,191
Sonny, I beat you so bad
in basketball yesterday.

1531
01:25:28,441 --> 01:25:31,068
From now on, I have to
stop letting you win.

1532
01:25:31,319 --> 01:25:33,320
I stopped that months ago.
He still wins.

1533
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:35,405
That's because you suck.

1534
01:25:35,989 --> 01:25:39,075
Corinne, put a tank top
on for old time's sake.

1535
01:25:39,325 --> 01:25:41,994
- What is he talking about, Mommy?
- Nothing.

1536
01:25:43,495 --> 01:25:46,206
- Happy birthday, Sonny.
- Thank you.

1537
01:25:46,456 --> 01:25:47,457
It's a clock radio.

1538
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:49,959
- Thanks for telling me.
- I have to split.

1539
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:51,335
I got deliveries.

1540
01:25:51,585 --> 01:25:53,545
Hang out with us.
We'll have fun.

1541
01:25:53,795 --> 01:25:56,798
No, I can't stay. I'll
hang for a little bit.

1542
01:25:57,048 --> 01:25:59,425
There you go. Come on,
let's eat, everybody.

1543
01:25:59,675 --> 01:26:01,969
Hey, you! Still missing
that tooth, huh?

1544
01:26:02,344 --> 01:26:03,470
Can we get some fries?

1545
01:26:05,472 --> 01:26:06,598
Vanessa.

1546
01:26:08,057 --> 01:26:09,475
You're a Hooters girl?

1547
01:26:09,725 --> 01:26:12,144
What happened to Sid's
five-year plan?

1548
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:19,191
How you doing?

1549
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:23,778
- Maybe it's a 10-year plan.
- Is that the guy with the old balls?

1550
01:26:24,029 --> 01:26:24,946
I think it is.

1551
01:26:25,488 --> 01:26:28,241
Come on. I bet they're nice.

1552
01:26:31,034 --> 01:26:33,328
You're not supposed to
say "balls." Testicles.

1553
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:52,000
