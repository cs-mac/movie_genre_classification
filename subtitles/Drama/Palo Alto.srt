1
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,115
Teddy?
Hmm.

2
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,450
If you were in the olden
times, what would you do?

3
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:02,253
Which olden times?

4
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:04,990
Like, King Arthur, with
knights and horses and shit.

5
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,928
I'd be the king! You can't
be king, dog. No way.

6
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:13,165
Dude, if I went back,
I'd be the fucking king.

7
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,366
I'd be the king.

8
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:19,755
Then, I'd fuck every
virgin in the kingdom.

9
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,040
No, you can't be
king, asshole. Okay?

10
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,976
You can't even be duke.

11
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,112
The fact that you fucking said
that shows you're not royalty.

12
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,280
You're a peasant.

13
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:30,115
Peasant!

14
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:32,150
Dude, but think about it.

15
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:34,386
When people time travel,
they go back

16
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,521
aren't they always the king,
or they know the king?

17
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:39,458
But that's in stories. In stories
everybody's going to be the king.

18
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:42,194
It's Aristotle shit.
It's not real.

19
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,030
Yeah, but neither
is time travel.

20
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,733
There're very few fucking kings and
you wouldn't be one of them, okay?

21
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,300
King Teddy?

22
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:52,003
King Teddy? That's a
fucking turd's name, dude.

23
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:54,039
Fuck you, Fred.

24
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,941
Fuck you, you're an idiot.
You're an idiot.

25
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,192
I know.

26
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:02,164
If you were king,
I'd fucking kill myself.

27
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:06,735
Then you better die,
motherfucker,

28
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,820
'cause I'm the king
around these parts.

29
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:14,025
Fuck, Fred.

30
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:17,345
Oh, shit!

31
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,414
Whoo!

32
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:24,553
That felt so fucking good.
That felt so...

33
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:44,172
Hey, April!

34
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,441
Wanna join us?

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,586
All right girls, circle up.

36
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:01,039
Bring it in.

37
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:04,242
Have a stretch.

38
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:05,410
All right, on the ground.

39
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:10,382
Oh, I'm so wet.

40
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,350
Not in a good way, either.

41
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:15,553
Mr. B's a hottie, though.
Fuck, I know.

42
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:18,874
Right? Too bad he wants
to get it in with April!

43
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,125
I know.

44
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,711
No, he doesn't.
Why would you say that?

45
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:24,545
You just went to have a fucking
cigarette during practice!

46
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,181
I said I was going
to the bathroom.

47
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:29,601
I'd go for it, if I were you.

48
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:32,053
Guys, it's so awkward.
I baby-sit his kid.

49
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,421
So?

50
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,742
I bet he makes a really
ugly face when he comes.

51
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,794
You pervert!
No, I'm just saying...

52
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:42,297
I bet it's like this.
He's like...

53
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:45,533
All right girls!
Good practice.

54
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,419
Oh, shit! You think
he heard what I said?

55
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:50,522
Yeah, he saw you. He's like,
"Wait, that's my face."

56
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:52,491
April, can I talk
to you for a minute?

57
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:57,762
Hey, you think you can
babysit Michael on Saturday?

58
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:59,114
I have a date.

59
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:02,384
I don't know why I try.

60
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:04,819
Dates are always stupid.

61
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:10,625
Um, yeah, I can
babysit on Saturday.

62
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:11,626
Great.

63
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:15,279
And I think you
should play striker.

64
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:19,334
I know it's a lot of
responsibility, lot of pressure,

65
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:21,069
but you look really
good out there, so...

66
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:22,504
Thanks.

67
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,173
Great.

68
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:26,258
So, I'll see you Saturday.

69
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,242
Okay, yeah.

70
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:30,345
Okay.

71
00:04:57,757 --> 00:04:58,690
Fred.
Hey.

72
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:02,176
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

73
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,378
Yeah, this place is dead.

74
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:07,816
Teddy, what would you do if
you got into a car accident?

75
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,484
Uh, I'd be pissed.

76
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,586
If it was a drunk
driving accident,

77
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,388
and you were the
one that was drunk?

78
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,991
How bad is the accident?

79
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,494
It's bad, you crashed right into
another car, but your car still runs.

80
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,363
Shit. And the other
person could be dead,

81
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:24,699
or they could just be a little
whiplashed but you don't know.

82
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,902
Who is the person? You don't know, man!
That's the point.

83
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:30,839
You can either wait around and
the other person could be April

84
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,890
and you two could fall in love, or
you can get the fuck out of there.

85
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,726
Either way you have to decide.
Pretend like it happened now.

86
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,394
Boom! That's the accident.

87
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,430
What would you do?
I drive away.

88
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,198
Drive away?
Yeah.

89
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,333
You fucking drive away?
Yeah.

90
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:42,667
That's your final answer?

91
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,435
Yeah, dude.

92
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:46,704
Shit, you got
issues, nigger.

93
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,611
Hi, Meatball. Hi.

94
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:56,681
I know. Did you miss me?
Come here.

95
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,686
Oh, hi, silly pretty thing.

96
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:02,654
Hey, Stewart.

97
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:06,725
Get that terrible rodent
out of here.

98
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:19,420
Were you playing video games?

99
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:20,655
Shooting hookers?

100
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,860
Yes.
Brilliant.

101
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:32,216
Oh, speaking of brilliant.
I corrected your paper.

102
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,405
I called it
"Alexander the Dubious."

103
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:43,411
You could have
just corrected it,

104
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,680
you didn't have
to rewrite the whole thing.

105
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:46,547
Yeah, well.

106
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,218
It needed quite a bit
of work, sweetie.

107
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:53,354
Okay.

108
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,223
Thanks.

109
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:57,292
Bye.

110
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:01,729
What happened with your
colonoscopy today? Are you okay?

111
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:04,966
Yeah, hold on a minute.
April's here.

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,335
I just wanna say hi to her,
will you hold on for a sec?

113
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,770
Hi.
Hi, honey. How are you?

114
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,622
Yeah, I'm good.
Just kind of tired.

115
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,708
I'm gonna go lie down
for a little.

116
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:14,642
You look tired.

117
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:17,963
Just said that.

118
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:21,082
You really need to rest.
Are you depressed?

119
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:22,801
No, why do you always
ask me if I'm depressed?

120
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:24,436
I'm not depressed.
I'm tired.

121
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,339
All right.
I love you.

122
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:30,558
Okay, Jamal, I'm gonna
call you back in a little bit.

123
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:42,703
I don't care. Tsk.

124
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:43,804
Whatever!

125
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,573
You don't wanna talk to me?

126
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,541
I don't wanna talk to you first.

127
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,377
And I'm not doing that paper.

128
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:50,946
'Cause I don't give a fuck.

129
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,463
This is what I think.

130
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,666
Later.

131
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,469
No one even cares
'cause you're fat.

132
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:08,897
<i> What is this homework?
 It's algebra.</i>

133
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:11,799
Phew, I would never be able to do that.
How do you do that?

134
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,969
Because I have to.

135
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:16,972
<i> My little baby!</i>
<i>I'm not a baby.</i>

136
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:19,741
You're such a little baby.
Mmm-mmm.

137
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,843
You are. You need
to relax and rest.

138
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:33,737
Okay, so everyone knows
how to play, right?

139
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:36,925
You just say,
"Never have I ever..."

140
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,961
And then if you've done
the thing you have to drink.

141
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:43,431
Like if you say, "I've never
cheated on my boyfriend"

142
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:46,885
and you have cheated on your
boyfriend, then you have to drink!

143
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,589
Um, never have I ever given
Seth Monkarsh a blow-job

144
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:54,376
during free period
in the senior parking lot.

145
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,793
Uh-oh.
Drink up, Chrissy.

146
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,896
Yup.

147
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,868
Okay fine, my turn.
Um, hmm.

148
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:06,371
Never have I ever...

149
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,341
Kissed my uncle.

150
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:11,726
What?

151
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:14,562
Are you fucking serious?
That was private.

152
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:19,400
Fucking freak.

153
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,875
Hey, April.
Hey, Teddy. Oh!

154
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,245
You all right there?

155
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,947
The chair's broken.

156
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,151
Do you need a light?
Sure.

157
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:16,807
Thanks.

158
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:23,247
Why are you doing that?

159
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,733
Would you mind your own business?
These are my stepbrother's.

160
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:28,836
Not like they're fucking working anyway.

161
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,792
This party sucks.

162
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,949
Do you wanna go over
to the graves for a bit?

163
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:43,684
Yeah.

164
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:46,237
Do you wanna come?

165
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:47,872
Sure.

166
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,010
Never have I ever

167
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:56,114
had a lesbianic experience.

168
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:02,503
I've never been in love.

169
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,873
I think it's bullshit.

170
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:14,732
I stole
your lamp shade.

171
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,970
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna fall.

172
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,164
Oh, my God!

173
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:32,867
Ah, I got you guys.

174
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,038
It's uncool dude, there could
be ghosts around here.

175
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,240
Jesus.
Don't even say that.

176
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:42,009
Hey, you guys remember that kid in
eighth grade who suicided himself?

177
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:43,644
Yeah, that's...
I remember that.

178
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:45,747
The Asian kid?
Yeah.

179
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:49,117
Why do you think
he killed himself?

180
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:51,219
He's buried here.

181
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,856
I think he killed himself because he was Asian.
I think it's pretty obvious.

182
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,558
What does that even mean?

183
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,227
It means his parents pressured
the shit out of him

184
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,962
because he was Asian, duh?

185
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:05,599
I don't think that's true.

186
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:08,669
I don't really think you know any
better than me, so no point talking.

187
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,055
Okay.

188
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,123
You got it.
Oh, shit!

189
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,708
Whoo!

190
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:21,115
Stop!

191
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,085
My parents
are gonna fucking flip.

192
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:25,837
Wow.

193
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,709
It's kind of hard.

194
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:33,011
That's what she said.

195
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:35,046
It's cool looking.

196
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,051
Ted, check this out.

197
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:48,709
Be careful.

198
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:57,101
Do you think it hurts
shooting yourself?

199
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:59,404
Probably for a second.

200
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:03,808
But, er, I think pain only
hurts if it's prolonged.

201
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:05,125
If I was going to kill myself,

202
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:10,148
I'd kill a bunch of other people
and take 'em down with me.

203
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:11,131
I wouldn't waste it.

204
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,466
Why would you do that?

205
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,369
Why wouldn't you do like a bunch
of really crazy good things

206
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:20,208
you know, like help people
or save kids or something.

207
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:24,245
I think when you're suicidal, though, you're
probably only thinking about yourself.

208
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:27,932
I don't know.
I try to be good.

209
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:30,218
Fuck good, guys.
Fuck good.

210
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,136
Live the dangerous life.

211
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,198
Where have you been?

212
00:13:43,232 --> 00:13:46,000
Listen. I asked Tyler
if he'd go out with me.

213
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:47,268
And either he
didn't hear me or he...

214
00:13:48,737 --> 00:13:50,705
I don't know why he would...

215
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:09,190
Whoo!

216
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:01,742
<i> Where'd April go? Are you
still hung up on April, dude?</i>

217
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:02,977
<i>Get over it.</i>

218
00:15:04,513 --> 00:15:05,980
<i>Be strong.</i>

219
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:07,982
<i>Be strong.</i>

220
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,206
Bye!

221
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,753
You okay?
Shut up.

222
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:32,857
Did you get it all out?

223
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,759
Shut up.

224
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:38,562
Do you want some water?

225
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:39,997
Mouthwash.

226
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,834
Okay, come on.
It's in the bathroom.

227
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,038
Oh, yeah!

228
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,294
<i> And the boring days
are like clockwork </i>

229
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,802
What's up, April?

230
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:05,272
How you doing?
Good.

231
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:07,274
Nice.

232
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:10,912
I like your skirt or dress,
I don't know what it is.

233
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:12,312
But it's really pretty.

234
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:14,749
Thanks.

235
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:18,419
The color brings out your eyes or
something, it's really... I like it.

236
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,070
It's tight.

237
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,373
Even your moccasins,
those are awesome also.

238
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,576
Just got it all going on.

239
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,828
Thanks.

240
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,563
You enjoying the party?

241
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:32,200
Yeah, it's fun.

242
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,068
You know what
your outfit's missing?

243
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:38,322
Is this hat.
I think it'd complete it.

244
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:41,259
Actually... You look good
as is, actually.

245
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,199
You're raging tonight or
you're just kind of chilling?

246
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,234
Raging.
We're going off, huh?

247
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:51,502
Yeah.

248
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:53,037
I'm asking...

249
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:57,208
Do you want to do a shot
or something?

250
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:59,843
Yeah, cheers to that.
Let's go grab one. Wow.

251
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:01,345
Whoo.

252
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:28,015
Oh, fuck!

253
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,943
Have you seen April around here?

254
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,547
She's right there, man.

255
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:04,251
Fred, let's get
the fuck out of here, man.

256
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,254
Hey Teddy, where are we going?

257
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:09,223
Fucking nowhere.

258
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:13,010
On a scale of one to baked,
how baked are you?

259
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:15,262
Fucking baked!

260
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,151
What the fuck?

261
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:26,607
What the fuck was that?

262
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:29,560
Dude, what the fuck
are you doing?

263
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:34,348
How the fuck did you know?
How did I know what?

264
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,750
How did you know I'd get
in a fucking accident?

265
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:37,551
I didn't. What do you
mean how did I know?

266
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:39,119
What if, yeah, what if?

267
00:19:39,153 --> 00:19:41,221
Just stop, stop.
Let me out.

268
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,077
Teddy, you're not really
blaming me for this, are you?

269
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:48,562
Really?

270
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,316
I'll see ya.

271
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:00,157
You know, you're being
kind of a dick.

272
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,442
Fuck.

273
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:36,477
That's him, Officer.
Okay.

274
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:38,612
That's definitely the car.

275
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:46,287
Okay, it seems like you're
the one I'm looking for.

276
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:47,871
Someone called
your plates in, buddy.

277
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:49,256
Can I see your license?

278
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:55,362
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

279
00:20:57,749 --> 00:20:59,750
To the front of the car,
over there.

280
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:01,418
Now face this way.

281
00:21:01,452 --> 00:21:02,203
It's a kid.

282
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:06,073
Walk in a straight line.
I can't do that.

283
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:10,510
Okay, then recite the alphabet
backwards from Z to A.

284
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:12,346
Backwards?
Yes.

285
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,699
Can't do that shit.
Why don't you try?

286
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,267
Oh. See, we got
a wise one here, huh?

287
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,486
I'm not fucking wise, Chip.

288
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:21,371
I just can't recite
my alphabet backwards.

289
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,857
Can't even do that shit sober.

290
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,525
Listen, smart ass.

291
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,677
You can either do
the sobriety test,

292
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:28,762
or I can take you to the hospital
and you can do a blood test.

293
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:29,663
What do you wanna do?

294
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:37,287
Y-X-Z... F-U-C-K U!
U! U! U!

295
00:21:37,322 --> 00:21:38,889
U, U!

296
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,958
You have the right to remain silent.
Fuck you.

297
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,977
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

298
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,344
Do you understand that?

299
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,146
You have the right
to an attorney.

300
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,615
If you cannot afford one, one
will be appointed for you.

301
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:49,700
Do you understand these rights?

302
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:50,501
Fuck you.

303
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,170
Yeah, fuck you, too.
Hey!

304
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:57,207
Put your head down.

305
00:21:57,241 --> 00:21:58,676
Oh, my God.
Fucking pig!

306
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:14,668
Oh!

307
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,490
Holy fucking shit!
What?

308
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,309
No fucking way, this is too good.
What is it?

309
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:23,711
How do we not know about this?

310
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:25,312
What is it?

311
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:27,514
Do you know
that Emily has a blog?

312
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,883
You're kidding me. Holy shit!
Look at these pictures.

313
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:32,469
Who does that?

314
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:37,807
Emily blew Teddy last night
in your parents' bedroom.

315
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,445
You're lying.
Mmm-mmm.

316
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,313
How do you know that?
Seth told me.

317
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:44,381
How gross is that?

318
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,617
In my parents' bedroom?

319
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:50,854
She will suck any dick that
anyone puts in her face.

320
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,289
God almighty!

321
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:56,526
She's going down.

322
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,764
What are you playing?

323
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:19,433
<i>Doodle.</i>

324
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,035
What's that?

325
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:23,803
It's just like you have to get
the turtle to the other side.

326
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:59,322
Come on, enough of this game.

327
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,692
Let's watch a movie.

328
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,441
I don't think I'm allowed
to watch this movie.

329
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,877
Why? It's a good movie.

330
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,890
Whoa.

331
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:41,332
Okay, I think you're right.
It's time for bed, okay?

332
00:25:41,366 --> 00:25:44,535
I don't wanna go to bed.
I like this movie.

333
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:46,870
I bet you do. Come on, let's go.
Bed time.

334
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,451
<i>I want us to be able
to be friends.</i>

335
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:03,937
<i>I always asked you
to hang out and like...</i>

336
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:12,479
<i>A back area and like,
hang out there with, like...</i>

337
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:13,747
Hey.
Hi.

338
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,903
What are you watching?

339
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:23,173
I don't know.
Some reality show.

340
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,675
Ah.

341
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,879
Well, that was a shitty date.

342
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:31,815
What happened?

343
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:34,818
Nothing.

344
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:39,990
Just like always.
Teachers are so boring.

345
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:45,662
I can't believe you guys have to
sit there and listen them all day.

346
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:47,664
At least I can go home.

347
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:50,567
Yeah. Well, I don't
really listen to them.

348
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,703
Oh, really?

349
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:56,573
You don't listen to me?

350
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:58,509
I didn't mean you. Of
course I listen to you.

351
00:26:58,543 --> 00:26:59,810
Yeah, you better.

352
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:12,823
Well, I should go.

353
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:19,730
Sorry.

354
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:24,568
Bye.

355
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,503
Well, thanks again,
I really appreciate it.

356
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:28,071
Sure.

357
00:27:30,141 --> 00:27:31,475
See you at practice.

358
00:27:49,593 --> 00:27:51,662
I'm dizzy.
Emma, sit down.

359
00:27:51,696 --> 00:27:52,829
Why?
Come on.

360
00:27:57,268 --> 00:27:58,668
Teddy Morrison.
Yeah.

361
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:03,974
Hey, are you in trouble?

362
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,249
<i> Mr. Morrison, this is the second
time you've been before the court.</i>

363
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:17,304
<i>Given the support
you have from your family,</i>

364
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:19,072
<i>from the school
and the community,</i>

365
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:23,109
<i>the court would like to give you one
last chance to turn your life around.</i>

366
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:24,878
<i>In lieu of commitment,</i>

367
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:28,131
<i>you shall be placed on probation
for a period of 12 months</i>

368
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,701
<i>on the following terms
and conditions.</i>

369
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:37,791
<i>One, you shall perform 150 hours of community
service at the children's library.</i>

370
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:42,362
<i>Given your demonstrated talent as an artist
and painter I think you'll do quite well.</i>

371
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:46,899
<i>Two, you must make a formal and in
person apology to Mrs. Grossman,</i>

372
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,603
<i>the victim of the offense
and whose car you hit.</i>

373
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:56,109
<i>Mr. Morrison, if you fail to complete
your community service hours</i>

374
00:28:56,143 --> 00:28:59,663
<i>or if you engage in any further
criminal conduct of any sort</i>

375
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:03,716
<i>your probation will be revoked and you
will be committed to juvenile hall.</i>

376
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:06,953
<i>All right,
thank you and good luck.</i>

377
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:18,331
Teddy, can you help me?

378
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,832
Yeah.

379
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:21,635
Emma, get your shoes.

380
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:32,362
I Love you, Mom.
I love you, too, honey.

381
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,830
Really sorry about all this.

382
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:35,081
Don't forget to apologize
to that woman.

383
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:39,252
Try not to hang around Fred.

384
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:43,206
Love you, Mom.

385
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,888
Hey, Teddy, look what I can do.

386
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,192
Yeah. Get out of my room!

387
00:30:04,578 --> 00:30:05,812
Could you get out of my room?

388
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:07,947
Get out.

389
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,704
He's cute.
Give me some of that.

390
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:16,005
He's not cute.

391
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,907
Fred?

392
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,009
Yes, he is.
He's horrible looking.

393
00:30:20,044 --> 00:30:23,079
No, he's cute.
You think everyone's cute.

394
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:23,980
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

395
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:27,868
And this is how
you didn't make a basket.

396
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:30,320
Dude, chill the fuck out!

397
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:33,106
Basketball, you know how to play basketball?
It's how you play on the streets.

398
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,023
Fuck you!
What the fuck, Fred?

399
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:35,191
Call it, bitch.

400
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:37,293
I fucking am.
Oh, you are a bitch?

401
00:30:37,328 --> 00:30:39,295
No, I'm calling a fucking foul.
You play dirty.

402
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,164
Oh, I play dirty?
I play dirty?

403
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:43,049
Yeah, you fucking do
and you need to chill.

404
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,151
Ladies, ladies.
Do you think I play dirty?

405
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:47,087
Do you think I play dirty?

406
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:48,955
Jacko, you think I play dirty?

407
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:51,892
Yeah, kind of.

408
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:54,761
What the fuck?
You're on my team.

409
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:57,364
This isn't powder puff football.
This isn't two hand touch.

410
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,199
Let's just play.
Chill out. God!

411
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,304
Real fucking tough.

412
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:06,890
Fucking cheese dicks.
Enjoy your fucking game.

413
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:12,128
See ya.
Fuck you, mama boy.

414
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:20,987
Hey, ladies, I wanna apologize
for my bad language back there.

415
00:31:24,075 --> 00:31:25,341
How's the smoking?

416
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:26,493
Fucking fine.

417
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:28,278
Mmm.

418
00:31:28,313 --> 00:31:30,013
Can I try some of that
fucking fine cigarette?

419
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,790
That is fucking fine.
You want it back?

420
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:42,875
No?

421
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,945
You know what
bugs me about you, Pam?

422
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:48,532
You remind me
of a praying mantis.

423
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:50,483
You're all long and mantis like

424
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:53,904
and it just really gets on my
nerve because, you know...

425
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:55,405
How am I supposed to know if
you're a girl or a praying mantis?

426
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,990
I wanna go, Emily.

427
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:58,224
Don't go.
Did I offend you?

428
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,326
Fuck you.
Are you coming?

429
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,296
I don't think she wants
to go with you.

430
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,063
Sorry. She wants
to stay. Emily?

431
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,834
I think I'm gonna stay.

432
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:09,102
Yeah!

433
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,837
Fuck you guys.

434
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:12,939
Fuck you. Go eat some more of
your fucking mates, bitch!

435
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:17,394
Sorry, I...

436
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:21,931
Guess I kind of
ruined your friendship.

437
00:32:21,965 --> 00:32:23,966
She wasn't really a friend.
Just a girl.

438
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:28,939
<i>Wanna get out of here?</i>

439
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:30,339
<i> Yeah.</i>

440
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:34,343
<i>Do you wanna come over? Yeah.</i>

441
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:40,150
Whoa!

442
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,385
Emily's room.

443
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,786
Do you like it?

444
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,157
Hey, you got a lot
of shit in your room.

445
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:48,324
Yeah.

446
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:50,927
What's this?

447
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:53,396
That's my headband.

448
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:54,897
Do I look sexy? Second grade.

449
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:55,999
Yo, what's up?

450
00:33:00,972 --> 00:33:02,438
Where's Teddy?

451
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:05,241
Why does everybody always
ask about Teddy, seriously?

452
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,893
I don't know.
You're always with him.

453
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:09,913
He follows me around.
What am I supposed to do?

454
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,314
I'm not a rude person.

455
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,118
Is that your guitar?

456
00:33:15,653 --> 00:33:17,020
Yeah.

457
00:33:17,054 --> 00:33:18,371
I don't know how
to play it, though.

458
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:19,573
Can I play?

459
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:21,274
Yeah. Do you know how?

460
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:24,077
Yeah, fucking master of guitar.

461
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:24,994
Virtuoso.

462
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:34,871
<i> Emily
Emily, Emily, Emily</i>

463
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:36,873
<i> Emily, Emily, Emily</i>

464
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:39,509
<i> Emily, Emily, Emily</i>

465
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:41,344
<i> Whoo! Emily!</i>

466
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:44,181
<i> Whoo! Whoo! Emily!
Whoo! Whoo! </i>

467
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,185
I wrote that for you. Will
you teach me how to play?

468
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:49,452
Do you wanna know
how to play guitar?

469
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:50,887
All right, here we go.

470
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:53,323
Lesson 101, G-chord.

471
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:55,225
Put your fingers here.

472
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,394
One finger here.

473
00:33:58,663 --> 00:33:59,996
One finger here.

474
00:34:00,698 --> 00:34:02,399
One finger here.

475
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:04,867
Right. Now strum.

476
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:08,037
That was not that bad.

477
00:34:09,574 --> 00:34:11,474
Now, here's the second lesson.

478
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,244
Put...

479
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,118
Do you like building forts?

480
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,155
Sure.

481
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,995
What?

482
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,163
I don't know
what that is.

483
00:34:50,197 --> 00:34:52,999
A butterfly kiss.
Your mom never gave you those?

484
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:54,951
Mom never gave
me a butterfly kiss.

485
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,287
All right.

486
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:02,158
Where you going?

487
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:03,293
What do you mean?

488
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,028
You leaving?

489
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,062
Yeah.

490
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:09,466
It was fun.

491
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:12,068
Was it good?

492
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:14,304
Yeah.

493
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,407
It was good.

494
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:22,078
Will you call me?

495
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:23,346
Uh-huh.

496
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,083
Cool. All right.

497
00:35:28,218 --> 00:35:29,453
Peace out.
I'll see you around.

498
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:33,055
Bye.
Yeah, whatever.

499
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:49,238
...his arm
and that's the claw.

500
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,057
And these are
gonna be tentacles.

501
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,024
Oh, good.
Great job.

502
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,843
Like a man-octopus.

503
00:35:53,877 --> 00:35:55,211
And this is...

504
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:56,279
That's...
That's the head.

505
00:35:57,548 --> 00:35:59,015
Like a melon.

506
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:00,249
Well, it's like a cantaloupe.

507
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:01,751
Well, draw a cantaloupe
and I'm...

508
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:05,121
I wanna see... Draw a cantaloupe and I
wanna see how it looks compared to...

509
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:06,523
I'll do it but I don't get it.
Okay.

510
00:36:06,557 --> 00:36:07,390
Okay.

511
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:12,462
You draw fast.

512
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,580
You draw really fast.

513
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:19,369
You know, Picasso drew fast.

514
00:36:19,403 --> 00:36:20,603
He could draw a dove
in 16 seconds.

515
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,074
16 seconds.
You know the dove?

516
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:26,376
Uh, yeah, the doves are great.

517
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,311
They are great.

518
00:36:28,346 --> 00:36:33,282
But, you know, to do it in 16 seconds
it took 6 decades of practice.

519
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,035
Technical skill is not enough.
It's never enough.

520
00:36:37,337 --> 00:36:39,689
He had to master the masters

521
00:36:39,723 --> 00:36:41,007
before he was able

522
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:44,060
to abandon what he learned

523
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:45,294
and become Picasso.

524
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:49,181
You know, you remind
me of Sylvester Stallone.

525
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:50,783
What?
Yeah.

526
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:52,251
He's a very good artist.

527
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:56,306
Underneath all that muscle, you
know, he's a very smart dude.

528
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,209
And, you know, he wrote Rocky.

529
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:04,347
I mean, he wrote Rocky, he wrote all four of Rocky.
 I mean, that dude's smart.

530
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:30,523
What?

531
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:54,380
Yeah.

532
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:09,512
April.

533
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,180
Hey, Coach.

534
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:14,283
What're you doing
sitting in that locker.

535
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,221
I don't know.
I just like it sometimes.

536
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,455
Surprised you can fit in there.

537
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,391
I guess.

538
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,894
Wow.

539
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:28,648
Is everything okay? I haven't seen
you at practice past couple of days.

540
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,150
Yeah, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.

541
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:33,853
I just... I fell behind on a bunch of
schoolwork so I've been catching up.

542
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:36,372
Mmm-hmm. I promise I'll
be there next week.

543
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,574
Do I still get to play?

544
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:44,213
Yeah. I just wanted to
make sure everything's okay.

545
00:38:44,248 --> 00:38:46,582
You know you can talk to me, right?
That's part of what a coach does.

546
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:49,602
Okay.

547
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:52,371
If you need help with homework,
I'm pretty good at that, too.

548
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,308
Yeah, sure.

549
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:58,611
Why don't you just bring your schoolwork
to my house when you babysit next time?

550
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,280
Okay, I will. Mmm-hmm.
Yeah?

551
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,284
So, I'll see you at practice?
Yeah, I promise.

552
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,687
I will.

553
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,189
Promise? Okay.
Promise.

554
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:12,692
Don't get stuck in there.

555
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:18,748
I'm really sorry about
what happened. I can't...

556
00:39:18,782 --> 00:39:20,850
Oh, Teddy, Teddy.
What I did.

557
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:23,369
There's... There's no
need to apologize.

558
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,305
No, I...
No. No, there isn't.

559
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:26,306
And do you know why?

560
00:39:26,673 --> 00:39:27,940
Why?

561
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:29,442
Because you have a problem.

562
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:31,444
You're an alcoholic.

563
00:39:33,514 --> 00:39:34,914
But you know that, right?

564
00:39:34,948 --> 00:39:36,583
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

565
00:39:36,617 --> 00:39:40,019
I mean, it's getting to be
such a problem now, I just...

566
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:42,554
See, that's good
that he knows that.

567
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:45,959
That I understand that. The
reason I can spot people like you

568
00:39:45,993 --> 00:39:48,978
is because I have
a problem, too. Eating.

569
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:53,816
And in some way, your problem is
much easier to solve than my problem

570
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:58,320
because I have temptation at
least three times a day. And...

571
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:01,391
Thing is if you're an alcoholic
and you know you're an alcoholic

572
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:04,727
and you don't do something about
being that, you're an asshole.

573
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:06,930
That's a little much.

574
00:40:06,964 --> 00:40:08,881
We're talking about
alcohol here...

575
00:40:08,915 --> 00:40:11,434
Right. We're talking about
a slightly different

576
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:14,737
set of circumstances from
getting a Whitman sampler

577
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:17,707
and eating every
single chocolate in there.

578
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:20,426
You know, I don't really... You know what,
I really don't appreciate your attitude.

579
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:28,568
Hello.

580
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:30,036
I'm, uh, here for
the community service.

581
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,871
Oh, you must be Teddy.
Yeah, I am.

582
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:33,756
We're so happy to have you.

583
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,659
Great. Come on over
and I'll show you around.

584
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:24,907
Twenty two, 13... Where
are you 22.13? Hey.

585
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:27,409
Hey!

586
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,779
You know what? I'm
really liking it here.

587
00:41:29,813 --> 00:41:31,948
We really like you.
And you know what?

588
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:34,684
You can always come back
even after all this is over.

589
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:37,453
Right on.
Okay.

590
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,402
Hello.

591
00:41:52,436 --> 00:41:54,003
Dude, Fred, you can't be here.

592
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:54,838
Why not? I miss you.

593
00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:57,356
'Cause I'm working.

594
00:41:57,991 --> 00:41:58,925
Yeah, right.

595
00:42:00,027 --> 00:42:00,860
What're you doing?

596
00:42:01,494 --> 00:42:02,461
What's this?

597
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,964
<i>Rainbow Gremlins.</i>

598
00:42:04,998 --> 00:42:07,734
It's tight.
Used to be my favorite.

599
00:42:07,768 --> 00:42:09,902
This shit is stupid. This
book is your favorite? Yeah.

600
00:42:10,854 --> 00:42:11,471
Faggot.

601
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:15,975
Holy shit!
Rainbow Gremlins were gay.

602
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:17,042
Dude...
They were fucking gay.

603
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:18,043
Shut up. You gotta
keep it down.

604
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,779
Dude, they sucked
the juice out of rainbows.

605
00:42:19,813 --> 00:42:21,046
Shut up.
We're in a library, man.

606
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,615
They sucked the
juice out of rainbows.

607
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,849
Rainbows are gay, get it?

608
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:26,469
So?

609
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,770
Don't get all defensive about it.
It's just a fact.

610
00:42:28,805 --> 00:42:30,240
You and the Rainbow Gremlins
are gay as fuck.

611
00:42:30,274 --> 00:42:31,707
Yeah, fuck you, dude.

612
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:32,792
They're a bunch of dudes

613
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:34,760
and they just hang out all
the time, all together.

614
00:42:34,795 --> 00:42:36,612
That' all they do.
Just fucking hang out.

615
00:42:36,646 --> 00:42:37,981
It's exactly what we do.

616
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:42,501
What're you...
No. Fred?

617
00:42:46,073 --> 00:42:47,373
You can't do that, dude.

618
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:50,143
Dude, look.
No...

619
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:50,977
Pubes.

620
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:01,437
That was
really trippy, man.

621
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:04,473
It's like, think of all the people that
fucking died from eating mushrooms

622
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:06,609
before they discovered
the psychedelic ones.

623
00:43:07,077 --> 00:43:08,410
What do you mean?

624
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:11,180
Like, think about all the people
that, like, just ate mushrooms

625
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,815
<i>until they found the one
that gets you all fucked up.</i>

626
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,634
Hey, man, let's just try this mushroom.
See if it gets...

627
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:17,003
This is fucking
cow shit all over it.

628
00:43:17,037 --> 00:43:18,737
What're you saying?

629
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:21,507
Isn't it cow shit that makes
you high from the mushroom?

630
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:22,574
I don't know.
I think it helps.

631
00:43:24,945 --> 00:43:28,614
<i>Hey, you got anything
going on later?</i>

632
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:30,183
<i>You wanna go do something?</i>

633
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:31,150
<i>Can we go do something now?</i>

634
00:43:31,185 --> 00:43:33,186
<i> Can't.</i>
<i>Gotta finish this off.</i>

635
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,654
<i>Get it.</i>

636
00:43:34,688 --> 00:43:35,488
<i>What do you mean?</i>

637
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:37,690
This is the one
day I can't, man.

638
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:39,525
Sorry.

639
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,194
What am I supposed to do?

640
00:43:41,228 --> 00:43:42,895
I don't know.

641
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:44,029
Dude, I don't even wanna
hang out with you.

642
00:43:44,064 --> 00:43:45,698
You're boring as shit.

643
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:46,999
All you do is fucking
work and...

644
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:49,602
Fuck that shit.

645
00:44:13,677 --> 00:44:14,960
All right.

646
00:44:14,995 --> 00:44:17,997
Step one for doing homework
is turning off your phone.

647
00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:20,232
Fine.
Okay.

648
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,867
Now, it's simple.

649
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:25,037
The way to write a good
history paper is to

650
00:44:25,072 --> 00:44:27,707
choose your event and then
just explain why it happened.

651
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:32,111
History is just explaining
why things happened.

652
00:44:32,145 --> 00:44:34,880
But what if I don't think there's
a reason for something happening?

653
00:44:36,183 --> 00:44:38,250
Well, then you need
to think harder.

654
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:41,220
Yeah, but I do things all
the time for no reason.

655
00:44:41,254 --> 00:44:43,723
Mmm-hmm.
It's because you're young.

656
00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:46,759
And you don't know why you do
things but there's always a reason.

657
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:50,863
No?
Mmm-mmm.

658
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:52,998
Okay.

659
00:44:53,033 --> 00:44:57,136
I mean, if you wanted to, couldn't you just
say that the reason everything's happened

660
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:00,672
is because of one thing that happened at
the very, very, very beginning of time.

661
00:45:00,707 --> 00:45:02,975
Mmm-hmm. If you wanted
to be a smart-ass.

662
00:45:19,242 --> 00:45:20,076
Sorry.

663
00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:23,896
That's okay.

664
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:28,817
I really like you.

665
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:33,806
I really like you.

666
00:45:35,976 --> 00:45:36,909
Yeah, but

667
00:45:39,229 --> 00:45:40,796
I'm older and I know that

668
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:43,732
there aren't a lot
of good things around

669
00:45:45,835 --> 00:45:47,169
and I know that
you are really good.

670
00:48:04,558 --> 00:48:05,291
Okay, Teddy.

671
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:07,960
So.

672
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,046
Are you high?

673
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,830
No.

674
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:13,799
I don't smoke anymore.

675
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:14,833
You can test me.

676
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:20,856
You drew a penis
on the runaway bunny.

677
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:24,493
That was Fred.

678
00:48:25,812 --> 00:48:27,279
I didn't draw that.

679
00:48:27,314 --> 00:48:29,915
You had friends
coming to visit you

680
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,917
while you were doing community
service at the children's library?

681
00:48:32,936 --> 00:48:34,003
No one came.
It was me.

682
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,407
I... But I will
pay for it

683
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:41,360
and I know it was stupid... Oh, yeah.
You are going to pay for the book.

684
00:48:41,394 --> 00:48:43,262
But you're not gonna do
your hours there anymore.

685
00:48:44,865 --> 00:48:46,582
They really like me there and...

686
00:48:46,616 --> 00:48:48,384
No, they don't like you.

687
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:50,085
They don't like you one bit.

688
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,272
You're lazy and you carved
"ape" in the bench outside.

689
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:54,607
It was "April."

690
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:55,991
Why would you carve "April"?

691
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:58,310
I don't know.

692
00:48:58,345 --> 00:49:00,363
What kind of jerk defaces
a children's library?

693
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:04,100
I mean, come on!

694
00:49:04,134 --> 00:49:05,484
<i>People are counting on you.</i>

695
00:49:05,518 --> 00:49:07,920
<i>Your parents are
counting on you.</i>

696
00:49:07,954 --> 00:49:12,191
<i>Your little sister is counting on you.
What kind of example are you?</i>

697
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:15,227
<i>What goes through your mind when you do it?
Or do you not think at all?</i>

698
00:49:15,261 --> 00:49:17,096
<i>I'm gonna put myself
on the line, okay?</i>

699
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,431
<i>I could lose my job.</i>

700
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:21,533
<i>If you don't start thinking
about what you're doing</i>

701
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:24,303
<i>you're gonna land yourself
right in juvenile hall.</i>

702
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:26,405
<i>And who's this kid Fred?</i>

703
00:49:26,439 --> 00:49:29,141
<i>Why was he visiting
you at the library?</i>

704
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:31,143
<i>Why do you wanna hang around
with people like that?</i>

705
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:32,777
<i>That guy sounds like a loser.</i>

706
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:37,917
Hey, Fred!

707
00:49:41,554 --> 00:49:44,440
Hey, buddy, you looking
for Fred? He's not here.

708
00:49:44,474 --> 00:49:45,874
Can I come in for a second?

709
00:49:47,477 --> 00:49:49,044
Yeah, sure, you can come in.

710
00:49:49,078 --> 00:49:50,112
You okay?
Yeah.

711
00:49:51,148 --> 00:49:53,315
What's... What's going on?

712
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,937
You want something to eat, drink?
No. Thanks, I'm fine.

713
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:02,174
Had a pretty big
dinner last night.

714
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,308
Oh, yeah?
Oh, I mean tonight.

715
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:08,814
Last night.

716
00:50:09,482 --> 00:50:10,565
What did you have?

717
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Pasta.

718
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:14,970
Yeah.

719
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:17,473
I'm a little, uh...

720
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:19,074
You smell that?

721
00:50:19,108 --> 00:50:21,009
Oh, yeah.
I'm a little high.

722
00:50:21,044 --> 00:50:22,127
I noticed that.

723
00:50:23,996 --> 00:50:26,248
Yeah?
It's cool, man.

724
00:50:26,282 --> 00:50:28,233
You wanna partake?

725
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:30,136
Sure. Yeah. Really?

726
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,039
Just do me a favor,
though. Don't...

727
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,907
Let's keep it between us.
Oh, for sure. Okay.

728
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:41,914
It's pretty strong, so go easy.

729
00:50:52,642 --> 00:50:54,142
I like your hair like that.

730
00:50:55,411 --> 00:50:56,211
My hair?

731
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:58,947
Thanks, man.

732
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:02,968
Ah.

733
00:51:03,302 --> 00:51:04,202
Ooh!

734
00:51:07,974 --> 00:51:09,475
Let me sit next to you.

735
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:10,942
One second.

736
00:51:10,977 --> 00:51:12,377
Feel like I'm so far
away over here.

737
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,651
Oh, God.

738
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:21,420
I love this couch.

739
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:23,422
Yeah, it's cool.
Isn't it comfortable?

740
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:24,289
Mmm-hmm.

741
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:28,160
It's my grandfather's
couch, this couch.

742
00:51:28,661 --> 00:51:29,495
Yeah?

743
00:51:31,397 --> 00:51:32,231
Bounce on it.

744
00:51:37,504 --> 00:51:41,173
Seriously. Just...
Just bounce on it.

745
00:51:41,207 --> 00:51:42,241
You want me to...

746
00:51:48,047 --> 00:51:50,048
I don't even know how
to answer that like...

747
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:51,383
Just bounce on it.

748
00:51:52,452 --> 00:51:54,153
Just do it.
Just do it.

749
00:51:55,054 --> 00:51:56,321
Do it once.
All right.

750
00:52:01,594 --> 00:52:02,427
My God.

751
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:05,997
I didn't know
you had an earring.

752
00:52:06,032 --> 00:52:07,699
I love it. I love that on you.
Yeah?

753
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:08,967
I did it myself.
Really?

754
00:52:10,303 --> 00:52:12,504
You're stoned, aren't you?
I love this hair.

755
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,607
I love it...
All right, all right.

756
00:52:15,642 --> 00:52:16,941
What?
What?

757
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:20,712
Just...

758
00:52:20,746 --> 00:52:22,080
Just touching my hair.

759
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,617
What?

760
00:52:25,652 --> 00:52:28,220
Nothing. You were just touching my hair.
It's funny.

761
00:52:29,656 --> 00:52:31,089
What's funny about it?

762
00:52:32,392 --> 00:52:34,159
Nothing. Relax, man.
It's cool.

763
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,063
What?

764
00:52:42,302 --> 00:52:43,535
Have you ever smoked with Fred?

765
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,148
All right, dude. I should
probably get going, man.

766
00:52:57,183 --> 00:52:59,351
Yeah, I just... Thanks for everything,
dude, I'll see you around.

767
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,286
Are you too high or...
No, I'm good, dude.

768
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:03,355
Thanks.
All right. Uh...

769
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:07,058
All right.
You okay to drive?

770
00:53:07,093 --> 00:53:08,527
Yeah, I am.

771
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:12,564
All right, buddy.

772
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:16,501
I think your dad
tried to come onto me.

773
00:53:16,536 --> 00:53:18,637
My dad's not gay, Teddy.

774
00:53:18,671 --> 00:53:19,571
Okay.

775
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:24,509
It's kind of one of those moments
we're gonna remember forever.

776
00:53:24,544 --> 00:53:25,444
Me and you.

777
00:53:26,279 --> 00:53:27,346
You ready?
Mmm-hmm.

778
00:53:28,314 --> 00:53:30,649
Dude, could I try first?

779
00:53:30,683 --> 00:53:33,218
You fucking kidding me? We'll
switch off half way or something.

780
00:53:34,186 --> 00:53:35,387
Fine. Go on.
All right.

781
00:53:39,525 --> 00:53:41,627
Dude, you're holding it way too fucking low.
No. No, no. Chill.

782
00:53:41,661 --> 00:53:43,662
I got it. No. Give me the fucking thing.
You're gonna...

783
00:53:43,696 --> 00:53:45,797
Stop. It'll cut your leg off.
Be careful, dude.

784
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:47,699
Let me try. Dude, it was
my idea in the first...

785
00:53:47,734 --> 00:53:50,201
I'll give it you... Okay. Just
fucking give it to me. Stop.

786
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,405
Okay.
Okay, I'm excited.

787
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,340
All right, let's do this, dude.

788
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:58,143
Let's cut this bitch down.
Come on.

789
00:53:58,177 --> 00:54:00,145
This fucking tree
needs to die tonight.

790
00:54:02,649 --> 00:54:03,615
Oh, yeah.

791
00:54:10,824 --> 00:54:12,357
Whoo!
Yes.

792
00:54:17,464 --> 00:54:19,281
I can't wait to come
see your band play.

793
00:54:19,315 --> 00:54:20,716
I know. We're good.

794
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,817
There's only three of us.

795
00:54:36,633 --> 00:54:37,499
Hello.

796
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:40,235
Drew your picture.

797
00:54:41,204 --> 00:54:42,204
Oh!

798
00:54:47,543 --> 00:54:48,376
Oh!

799
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,114
That's...

800
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:54,282
That's nice.

801
00:54:55,819 --> 00:54:57,219
Very nice.

802
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,337
I'll get it.

803
00:55:21,794 --> 00:55:22,861
Hi.

804
00:55:23,746 --> 00:55:24,913
Hi.

805
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,348
When I do this...

806
00:55:28,217 --> 00:55:29,485
Does it make me look Chinese?

807
00:55:34,674 --> 00:55:36,208
We're going to play
in the garden?

808
00:55:38,478 --> 00:55:39,344
Nice.

809
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:44,649
<i> Teddy was always</i>
<i>gone doing work</i>

810
00:55:44,684 --> 00:55:46,801
<i>or probation or whatever
you call that baloney.</i>

811
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:49,738
<i>We talked on the phone a few times.
Emily didn't have any friends.</i>

812
00:55:49,772 --> 00:55:51,523
<i>I didn't talk long. The only
person she knew was me.</i>

813
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:53,358
<i>Just enough to make
her feel comfortable.</i>

814
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:55,660
<i>One afternoon we went
to Jason King's house.</i>

815
00:55:55,695 --> 00:55:57,596
<i>She didn't talk much.</i>

816
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,231
<i>Jason's parents were gone.</i>

817
00:55:59,265 --> 00:56:00,165
<i>I did all the talking.
We were drinking</i>

818
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:01,967
<i>sodas and vodka and smoking pot.</i>

819
00:56:02,001 --> 00:56:03,568
<i>I was a nice guy.</i>

820
00:56:03,602 --> 00:56:04,803
<i>I'm a nice guy to everyone.</i>

821
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:06,304
<i>Emily came over.</i>

822
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:08,673
<i>I got her into Jason's parents'
bed and got her naked.</i>

823
00:56:09,976 --> 00:56:11,744
<i>The guys lined up
outside the bedroom.</i>

824
00:56:11,778 --> 00:56:13,511
<i>Big brown house.</i>

825
00:56:13,546 --> 00:56:15,714
<i>We went in
two or three at a time.</i>

826
00:56:18,118 --> 00:56:19,468
<i>Everyone fucked her.</i>

827
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:21,552
<i>We ran around the house to...</i>

828
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:22,921
<i>I kept going back
in with everyone...</i>

829
00:56:22,955 --> 00:56:24,239
<i>She gave me a blowjob.</i>

830
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:26,108
<i>I asked if she liked it.</i>

831
00:56:26,142 --> 00:56:27,976
<i>I had my clothes on when
I ushered people in.</i>

832
00:56:28,011 --> 00:56:29,311
<i>She said she did.</i>

833
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:30,779
<i>I was a wild monkey.</i>

834
00:56:32,816 --> 00:56:33,749
<i>Then I left.</i>

835
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:51,399
Tell me you love me.

836
00:57:15,692 --> 00:57:16,925
Hey.

837
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:17,826
Hey.
What's up?

838
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:20,862
Nothing.

839
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:21,930
How're you doing?

840
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:22,831
I'm fine. How are you?

841
00:57:23,883 --> 00:57:24,749
Good.

842
00:57:32,859 --> 00:57:33,658
Uh...

843
00:57:37,964 --> 00:57:39,481
Do you... Do you want it?

844
00:57:40,566 --> 00:57:41,733
I love the pink ones.

845
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:43,701
So good.

846
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:50,608
All right.
Thank you.

847
00:57:50,642 --> 00:57:51,743
Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye. Okay.

848
00:58:06,926 --> 00:58:07,926
That's how you play.
Go like this.

849
00:58:14,017 --> 00:58:14,950
All right.

850
00:58:17,103 --> 00:58:18,436
There you go.

851
00:58:34,987 --> 00:58:35,887
You almost got it.
Come on.

852
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:38,356
How's that foot?
Come here.

853
00:58:49,018 --> 00:58:50,585
Not in this color, though.

854
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,546
Hey.

855
00:59:02,514 --> 00:59:03,748
Beer?
No, thanks.

856
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:11,656
Wanna hear a joke?

857
00:59:15,644 --> 00:59:16,778
There's this horse
and a chicken.

858
00:59:18,647 --> 00:59:20,782
And the horse falls into
this big puddle of mud

859
00:59:22,151 --> 00:59:25,520
and, um, so the chicken
gets his Mercedes

860
00:59:25,554 --> 00:59:27,756
ties it to the horse
and pulls him out.

861
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:30,058
Then the chicken
falls into the mud.

862
00:59:30,093 --> 00:59:32,493
The horse doesn't get his Mercedes.
He just stands there.

863
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:34,562
And he says,

864
00:59:34,597 --> 00:59:36,932
"Just hold onto my thingy
and I'll pull you out."

865
00:59:39,402 --> 00:59:39,951
That's funny.

866
00:59:41,604 --> 00:59:43,772
Well, it's not over.

867
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:45,573
So, the moral of the story

868
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:47,776
is that if you're
hung like a horse

869
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,744
you don't need a Mercedes
to pick up chicks.

870
00:59:51,064 --> 00:59:52,764
Yeah. I get it.

871
00:59:58,788 --> 01:00:00,555
Why don't you talk to me
at school anymore?

872
01:00:02,942 --> 01:00:04,743
You know why.

873
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:07,946
Yeah, but you can at least be
nice to me, not just ignore me.

874
01:00:10,616 --> 01:00:12,617
I mean, it's like you don't
even like me anymore.

875
01:00:14,036 --> 01:00:14,970
Are you kidding me?

876
01:00:16,706 --> 01:00:17,806
April, I love you.

877
01:00:21,143 --> 01:00:22,010
What?

878
01:00:26,565 --> 01:00:27,799
Doesn't even make sense.

879
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:30,235
What? Why?

880
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:31,586
I have to go.

881
01:00:32,855 --> 01:00:34,990
April. What...
Hey, hey, hey.

882
01:00:35,024 --> 01:00:37,125
April, I love you.

883
01:00:38,944 --> 01:00:40,728
Okay.
I'm in love with you.

884
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,432
I just...

885
01:00:43,466 --> 01:00:46,735
I... I was quiet before because I
didn't want anything bad to happen

886
01:00:47,904 --> 01:00:49,521
but I don't care anymore.

887
01:00:49,555 --> 01:00:51,606
All right, I... I just
wanna be with you.

888
01:00:52,842 --> 01:00:54,843
We can
figure it out. You...

889
01:00:54,877 --> 01:00:56,677
You can just say you're babysitting
all the time and come over.

890
01:00:57,796 --> 01:00:59,497
No, I'm...

891
01:00:59,532 --> 01:01:01,783
I should be hanging out
with boys my own age.

892
01:01:01,785 --> 01:01:03,585
Why?

893
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,987
Why do you wanna hang out with a
bunch of little boys. You're...

894
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:07,489
You're better than that.

895
01:01:08,557 --> 01:01:09,924
Just be with me.

896
01:01:10,743 --> 01:01:11,610
April.

897
01:01:12,545 --> 01:01:13,528
Look, uh...

898
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:17,132
Please, all right.
Just...

899
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:19,867
Let's just...
Just start all over.

900
01:01:19,901 --> 01:01:22,504
Just watch a movie,
find something silly and...

901
01:01:24,773 --> 01:01:25,806
Like always, okay?

902
01:01:30,028 --> 01:01:30,962
Just stay. April!

903
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:38,002
So the founding of
Rome begins with a fratricide

904
01:01:38,036 --> 01:01:41,038
as Romulus kills
his twin brother, Remus.

905
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:45,277
Seems appropriate seeing as their
father is Mars, the Roman god of war.

906
01:01:47,813 --> 01:01:51,082
Folks, there will be a test on
this sometime in the next week.

907
01:01:51,117 --> 01:01:52,901
Thank you very much.
Great work today.

908
01:01:53,002 --> 01:01:54,653
April, can I talk
to you for a minute?

909
01:01:58,908 --> 01:01:59,774
Um...

910
01:02:02,178 --> 01:02:03,644
I read your paper.

911
01:02:05,914 --> 01:02:07,148
Did someone help you with this?

912
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:10,585
It doesn't seem
like your writing.

913
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:11,720
Um...

914
01:02:11,754 --> 01:02:13,087
It's my step-daddy.

915
01:02:13,121 --> 01:02:16,591
I just asked him to help me correct
it and then he just kind of

916
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,793
started rewriting it and...

917
01:02:18,827 --> 01:02:20,861
I can't give you a passing grade on this.
Do you understand?

918
01:02:22,147 --> 01:02:24,199
What's your next class?
I'll write you a slip.

919
01:02:24,233 --> 01:02:25,233
<i> It, uh...</i>

920
01:02:25,267 --> 01:02:27,953
<i>It's college counseling.</i>

921
01:02:27,955 --> 01:02:29,921
Do you know what college
you would like to go to?

922
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,123
They're so competitive
these days

923
01:02:32,158 --> 01:02:34,709
that you need all
the time you can get.

924
01:02:34,744 --> 01:02:36,060
I want you to give
some thought to that

925
01:02:36,095 --> 01:02:38,313
because there are
only a few weeks left.

926
01:02:38,347 --> 01:02:41,082
You excel in art class.

927
01:02:41,117 --> 01:02:42,867
Would you like to
go to an art school?

928
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:44,202
Maybe.
Maybe.

929
01:02:44,236 --> 01:02:45,836
Maybe.

930
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:47,872
You know what you wanna do?

931
01:02:47,906 --> 01:02:48,973
You know what you wanna be?

932
01:02:50,709 --> 01:02:52,443
I don't know.

933
01:02:52,445 --> 01:02:54,095
I want you to stay
on that soccer team

934
01:02:54,129 --> 01:02:56,947
because that could
be so helpful.

935
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,901
Can I go to the bathroom
real quick?

936
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:00,702
Uh, but...

937
01:03:05,374 --> 01:03:08,843
I'm literally punching myself that
I didn't buy that dress yesterday.

938
01:03:08,877 --> 01:03:10,245
Oh, I know.

939
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:12,864
No, honestly, it looks
so fucking good on me.

940
01:03:12,898 --> 01:03:13,831
You need to go back and get it.

941
01:03:13,865 --> 01:03:16,735
What if we just ditch and
go to the mall and get it.

942
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:19,070
Let's do it. Your tits are
seriously so huge today.

943
01:03:19,104 --> 01:03:20,204
I know, right?

944
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:22,056
They look amazing.

945
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,476
'Cause I'm on my period,
which kind of sucks but...

946
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:27,812
Probably, but it's totally worth it.
You're making the best of it.

947
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,164
They look great.

948
01:03:29,198 --> 01:03:31,382
Okay, I have to pee like
a mother fucking race horse.

949
01:03:31,417 --> 01:03:33,151
I do, too.

950
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:34,986
Why do they even say "I have
to pee like a race horse"?

951
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,254
I don't know.

952
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:38,323
I don't get that, like...

953
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:42,360
Do race horses just, like, have to
pee all the time. I don't get it.

954
01:03:42,395 --> 01:03:45,297
Because they're always
racing and they never get to pee.

955
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:47,399
Poor horsies. Oh, I don't
have toilet paper.

956
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:49,301
Can you spot me?

957
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:50,669
Of course, sweetie.

958
01:03:57,176 --> 01:03:58,009
Oh.

959
01:03:59,478 --> 01:04:01,913
All right.
How's my hair?

960
01:04:06,285 --> 01:04:07,518
Don't look
at the easel.

961
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,704
Look at the model instead.

962
01:04:09,738 --> 01:04:12,290
More green. Okay, no.

963
01:04:12,325 --> 01:04:14,859
You're looking at the easel.
You're looking at the easel.

964
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:16,928
Look at the model
and don't look at the easel.

965
01:04:16,962 --> 01:04:18,996
Jesus. That model's
kind of hot.

966
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:22,166
She looks like an old tree.

967
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:24,118
I'd fuck a tree.

968
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:27,505
I'd fuck the shit
out of that tree.

969
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:28,273
Nice.

970
01:04:33,512 --> 01:04:35,797
You know, I had a near death
experience myself once.

971
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:39,734
I was going down the tunnel

972
01:04:39,768 --> 01:04:42,070
in a convertible car,
old convertible car.

973
01:04:42,104 --> 01:04:44,539
It's not my car.
It's freezing cold.

974
01:04:44,573 --> 01:04:48,092
Ice, like brown
melting ugly ice.

975
01:04:48,126 --> 01:04:50,828
I say to myself, "Bob, you're
going down the tunnel of death."

976
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,431
Then I say to myself,

977
01:04:53,465 --> 01:04:56,267
"My name is not Bob.
I'm not Bob."

978
01:04:56,302 --> 01:04:58,502
Then I said,
"It's not my car."

979
01:04:58,537 --> 01:05:01,339
And this is not my tunnel.

980
01:05:01,373 --> 01:05:02,640
So, what happened?

981
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:06,094
I made a uie and suddenly I'm
going fast the other way

982
01:05:06,128 --> 01:05:07,896
and there's a rainbow.

983
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:08,997
It's a rainbow.

984
01:05:10,499 --> 01:05:12,400
You're going down
the wrong way, Bob.

985
01:05:12,434 --> 01:05:14,035
Turn your art around.

986
01:05:14,837 --> 01:05:16,871
Dude, I'm not Bob.

987
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:19,107
Yes, yes.

988
01:05:19,141 --> 01:05:20,491
All right.

989
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:21,992
That's right.

990
01:05:22,027 --> 01:05:23,445
I'm not fucking Bob.

991
01:05:23,479 --> 01:05:25,947
Dude, what the fuck is going on?

992
01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:31,452
This is kind of fun, isn't it?

993
01:05:31,486 --> 01:05:32,887
Yeah.

994
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:38,092
I'm doing an ocean.
What are you doing?

995
01:05:38,126 --> 01:05:39,994
I'm also doing an ocean.

996
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:41,796
Oh, I love yours.
That's so good.

997
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:43,598
Thank you.

998
01:05:43,632 --> 01:05:45,416
Hey, Teddy.
Hey.

999
01:05:45,451 --> 01:05:48,453
Tanya's daughter came by and saw
the pictures you drew of her.

1000
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,371
She liked them.
Really?

1001
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:52,057
You should go see her. Room 22.

1002
01:05:54,026 --> 01:05:55,293
Hey, Janet.
Bye.

1003
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:57,062
Hi.
How are you?

1004
01:05:57,096 --> 01:05:58,396
Oh, pretty good.
That's very pretty.

1005
01:05:58,430 --> 01:05:59,798
Yeah?
That's a fish.

1006
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:00,899
Hello.

1007
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:05,003
Yes. Oh, hi. Hi.

1008
01:06:05,037 --> 01:06:07,038
How are you doing? I'm fine.
Sit down.

1009
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:10,408
I see you got the pictures up.

1010
01:06:10,443 --> 01:06:12,877
You draw so well.
No. I'm crap.

1011
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:15,162
No. No.
Come here.

1012
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:21,869
You're a good boy.

1013
01:06:23,038 --> 01:06:25,039
And you captured me good.

1014
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:26,541
Thank you.

1015
01:06:26,575 --> 01:06:28,042
Now listen,

1016
01:06:29,077 --> 01:06:32,580
always have faith and trust

1017
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,882
in your
God-given talent.

1018
01:06:36,518 --> 01:06:38,385
All right, what time is it?
Game time!

1019
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,288
That's right. All
right, listen up.

1020
01:06:40,322 --> 01:06:43,358
I want you to play a smart
game, pass the ball.

1021
01:06:43,392 --> 01:06:45,259
Keep it tight. High
pressure, all right?

1022
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:47,545
Everything we've been practicing.
Okay, you got this.

1023
01:06:47,547 --> 01:06:49,179
You got these bitches.

1024
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,048
They're pathetic all right.

1025
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:52,583
You got this, okay.
Yeah!

1026
01:06:52,617 --> 01:06:54,435
All right, bring it in. Bring it in.
Whoo!

1027
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,220
What are we going to do?
Win.

1028
01:06:56,254 --> 01:06:57,588
What are we going to do?
Win!

1029
01:06:57,623 --> 01:07:00,074
One, two, three, Panthers!
Panthers!

1030
01:07:00,108 --> 01:07:01,659
Come on!

1031
01:07:01,693 --> 01:07:03,044
Come on.

1032
01:07:10,268 --> 01:07:11,535
Raquel, that's you!
Let's go!

1033
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:15,306
Looking good, April!

1034
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:17,975
Come on!
Okay, pull back!

1035
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,161
Stretch!

1036
01:07:29,121 --> 01:07:30,104
Oh, my God!

1037
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,007
Come on, get up.

1038
01:07:35,127 --> 01:07:36,544
That's right,
push in! Push in!

1039
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,098
Fuck with me!

1040
01:07:40,132 --> 01:07:42,099
Fuck with me, bitch!
Come on.

1041
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:43,167
Shauna, what are you doing?

1042
01:07:46,038 --> 01:07:47,305
Thank you.
It's un-fucking-real!

1043
01:07:53,562 --> 01:07:54,328
Oh.

1044
01:07:55,898 --> 01:07:57,164
April, come on!

1045
01:08:01,053 --> 01:08:02,236
April, go!

1046
01:08:10,579 --> 01:08:11,912
All right.

1047
01:08:12,448 --> 01:08:14,115
All right, good game!

1048
01:08:14,983 --> 01:08:16,150
Good game.

1049
01:08:17,586 --> 01:08:19,053
Shake.

1050
01:08:20,622 --> 01:08:22,239
You got some good players.
All right. Thank you.

1051
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:31,316
Raquel is such a cry baby.
I know.

1052
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,151
She just does that
for attention, though.

1053
01:08:34,102 --> 01:08:35,236
You seriously think you're bad?

1054
01:08:37,422 --> 01:08:39,674
I mean, do you even
think she's pretty?

1055
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:42,176
Raquel? Yeah, she's
fucking gorgeous.

1056
01:08:42,211 --> 01:08:44,645
She's pretty.
You think?

1057
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:46,230
She's not ugly.

1058
01:08:46,264 --> 01:08:47,565
Don't blame yourself.

1059
01:08:47,599 --> 01:08:49,133
Okay.
All right.

1060
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:51,402
I'll see you next week.

1061
01:08:51,436 --> 01:08:52,337
I don't think she's so pretty.

1062
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:55,606
April, she's pretty.

1063
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:58,242
So, you three upset, too?

1064
01:08:58,644 --> 01:09:00,411
Obviously.

1065
01:09:00,446 --> 01:09:02,547
Yeah, we're not crying
but we're upset.

1066
01:09:03,548 --> 01:09:06,217
It's just a game.
We played very well.

1067
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:07,601
We kind of sucked.

1068
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:10,871
Um, no, you sucked.

1069
01:09:10,905 --> 01:09:12,256
Thank you, Mr. B.

1070
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,261
Anyone need a ride?

1071
01:09:17,295 --> 01:09:18,746
No, my mom's
going to come get us.

1072
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:20,448
I'm with her.

1073
01:09:20,483 --> 01:09:21,248
April?

1074
01:09:23,235 --> 01:09:25,703
Sure.
Okay, let's go.

1075
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:27,638
I'll see you guys later.
Bye, April.

1076
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,307
Night.
Night.

1077
01:09:30,675 --> 01:09:32,076
Bye.

1078
01:09:40,586 --> 01:09:41,586
Where's Michael?

1079
01:09:42,654 --> 01:09:44,255
Oh, he's at his moms.

1080
01:09:45,156 --> 01:09:46,190
Oh.

1081
01:09:50,262 --> 01:09:51,462
Want some water or something?

1082
01:09:52,264 --> 01:09:55,132
Um, no, that's okay.

1083
01:09:58,169 --> 01:09:59,470
It's nice to have you back here.

1084
01:10:01,373 --> 01:10:03,040
Don't worry about the game.

1085
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:51,288
I know it's not Thursday.

1086
01:10:53,391 --> 01:10:54,659
I always get the days wrong.

1087
01:12:24,349 --> 01:12:27,318
You so crazy.
You're so crazy.

1088
01:12:28,787 --> 01:12:32,256
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, Mom.

1089
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:33,791
Hold on, Jamal,
I'm gonna call you.

1090
01:12:33,825 --> 01:12:35,342
Do you want some breakfast?

1091
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:38,512
Um, that's okay.

1092
01:12:38,547 --> 01:12:40,764
I'm gonna call you back, okay?
Let me call you right back.

1093
01:12:40,799 --> 01:12:42,467
I can make you eggs and bacon.

1094
01:12:44,503 --> 01:12:46,904
Okay, sure.
That sounds good.

1095
01:12:46,939 --> 01:12:49,407
How 'bout some orange juice?
You want some orange juice?

1096
01:12:49,409 --> 01:12:51,458
I just love you, you're such a good girl.

1097
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:58,432
I love you, too. Aw. You
mean so much to me.

1098
01:13:05,157 --> 01:13:08,375
<i>Test your might!</i>

1099
01:13:18,653 --> 01:13:20,254
<i>Fight.</i>

1100
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:25,392
You're not allowed to do that.

1101
01:13:27,495 --> 01:13:28,729
Are you going to tell on me?

1102
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,009
Can I play?

1103
01:13:42,878 --> 01:13:44,512
Sure. I don't care.

1104
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:48,866
All right, what do I do?

1105
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,567
You have to pick
a character first.

1106
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:53,871
I wanna be the girl character.

1107
01:13:53,905 --> 01:13:56,824
The girl character?
She sucks.

1108
01:13:56,858 --> 01:13:58,792
Trust me.
I've played her.

1109
01:13:58,826 --> 01:14:00,861
All right, well, I still
wanna be her, so...

1110
01:14:01,579 --> 01:14:02,713
Suit yourself.

1111
01:14:03,781 --> 01:14:05,282
<i> Fight!</i>

1112
01:14:07,536 --> 01:14:09,570
Hey, how do I fight?
You press the buttons.

1113
01:14:09,604 --> 01:14:10,888
Oh, come on, which ones?

1114
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:14,809
Which color?

1115
01:14:14,843 --> 01:14:16,009
Hey.

1116
01:14:17,779 --> 01:14:18,746
Yes!

1117
01:14:19,464 --> 01:14:21,398
Two cookies please!

1118
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:22,950
What?

1119
01:14:22,984 --> 01:14:25,135
I get two cookies because I won.

1120
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:26,937
Says who?

1121
01:14:26,971 --> 01:14:27,839
Raquel.

1122
01:14:31,826 --> 01:14:33,377
Raquel?

1123
01:14:33,411 --> 01:14:35,346
Raquel's my other babysitter.

1124
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:37,348
She lets me have
two cookies when I win.

1125
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:39,466
Hmm.

1126
01:14:43,005 --> 01:14:44,538
Well, okay.

1127
01:14:52,581 --> 01:14:54,548
I want one Oreo
and one chocolate chip.

1128
01:14:55,517 --> 01:14:57,384
Here you go.
Have 'em all.

1129
01:15:25,863 --> 01:15:27,564
Hello.

1130
01:15:27,598 --> 01:15:30,734
<i> April.</i>
Who's this?

1131
01:15:30,768 --> 01:15:33,837
<i>Look, what happened between me and Raquel...
It's nothing, okay?</i>

1132
01:15:33,871 --> 01:15:35,906
<i>Can I just explain
what happened?</i>

1133
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:39,509
What?

1134
01:15:39,544 --> 01:15:43,880
<i>You broke up with me. And we weren't
talking to each other. Can I see you?</i>

1135
01:15:43,915 --> 01:15:47,418
No. No, I'm not coming
over there anymore.

1136
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:49,704
<i>April, I love you.
Please.</i>

1137
01:15:55,994 --> 01:15:58,212
Dude, isn't this a...

1138
01:15:58,247 --> 01:16:01,399
Oh, gee, you're acting like
we're in a recession. Give me.

1139
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:02,566
I wanna show you
how to do this shit.

1140
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:05,619
I ought to...

1141
01:16:05,654 --> 01:16:07,855
Chef Ivan at your service.

1142
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:12,376
Emily.

1143
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:17,147
Hey, Emily.
Emily, hi, hi.

1144
01:16:17,182 --> 01:16:18,949
Hi.
Hi.

1145
01:16:18,984 --> 01:16:21,785
You look, um...
You look really beautiful.

1146
01:16:22,921 --> 01:16:25,823
You look, uh...
Yeah, your whole,

1147
01:16:25,857 --> 01:16:28,558
um, dress.

1148
01:16:28,593 --> 01:16:31,195
You look really...
You look really great.

1149
01:16:31,229 --> 01:16:32,830
Thanks.

1150
01:16:32,864 --> 01:16:34,648
All right, sorry.

1151
01:16:34,682 --> 01:16:36,550
Hey, I have this idea, um...

1152
01:16:37,953 --> 01:16:40,554
Uh, I saw this pool.

1153
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:43,957
And I was wondering
maybe you want to like

1154
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,994
go swimming.

1155
01:16:47,028 --> 01:16:48,862
Swimming?
Yeah.

1156
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:50,965
<i> We could go swimming</i>

1157
01:16:50,999 --> 01:16:53,533
<i> We could go swimming </i>
Okay, fine.

1158
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:54,935
Fine.
Really?

1159
01:16:55,904 --> 01:16:58,172
Mmm-hmm.
Okay. Okay, all right.

1160
01:16:58,206 --> 01:16:59,807
Okay.

1161
01:17:09,183 --> 01:17:12,586
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
where's the light? The light?

1162
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:13,887
Need a lighter?
Yeah.

1163
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,758
Here you go.
Found it.

1164
01:17:17,793 --> 01:17:19,627
Jump. Jump to me. Jump to me.
Wait.

1165
01:17:19,661 --> 01:17:20,861
Jump... Whoa!

1166
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:22,730
Let's go.

1167
01:17:31,573 --> 01:17:33,040
Are you ready to
see me get naked?

1168
01:17:41,983 --> 01:17:43,784
What are you doing?

1169
01:17:43,819 --> 01:17:45,252
I'm jumping in the pool.
Aren't you getting in?

1170
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,488
No, it's cold.
Come on.

1171
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:55,729
This is called night swimming.

1172
01:17:55,764 --> 01:17:57,665
Ready, one, two...

1173
01:17:59,117 --> 01:18:00,868
They were just saying
that in college,

1174
01:18:00,902 --> 01:18:02,703
like girls have sex
all the time.

1175
01:18:02,737 --> 01:18:04,104
So maybe like when
you get to college,

1176
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:06,273
you won't be a sweet
little virgin anymore.

1177
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:07,808
Thank you.

1178
01:18:07,843 --> 01:18:09,877
She's a virgin? She's
a virgin, you guys.

1179
01:18:09,911 --> 01:18:12,746
Isn't that so adorable, though?
Look at... She's so pretty.

1180
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,281
We can do something about that.
No, April.

1181
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:17,718
You scared her off. They can help.
Oh, honey.

1182
01:18:17,752 --> 01:18:19,653
I mean, are you
all virgins, too?

1183
01:18:27,112 --> 01:18:28,645
Hey.
Hey.

1184
01:18:35,186 --> 01:18:36,686
How's it goin'?

1185
01:18:37,255 --> 01:18:39,156
Good.

1186
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,557
How are you?

1187
01:18:44,329 --> 01:18:46,096
You should, uh, flip one over

1188
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,766
for good luck.

1189
01:18:53,038 --> 01:18:55,272
You know like when
you get a new pack,

1190
01:18:55,307 --> 01:18:57,607
you always flip one over
and save it for last

1191
01:18:57,642 --> 01:18:58,909
and then when you get
to it you make a wish.

1192
01:19:00,078 --> 01:19:02,646
Oh, cool, I've never
heard of that.

1193
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,081
Like that?
Yeah.

1194
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:13,723
Do you need a light?

1195
01:19:20,182 --> 01:19:21,682
Thanks.
Yeah.

1196
01:19:28,923 --> 01:19:30,790
That movie is pretty
stupid.

1197
01:19:31,459 --> 01:19:32,626
Why?

1198
01:19:34,011 --> 01:19:36,913
I think all movies and TV shows

1199
01:19:36,948 --> 01:19:39,015
and video games these
days are just pointless.

1200
01:19:39,668 --> 01:19:40,868
Okay.

1201
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,908
You're crazy.

1202
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,228
No, I'm not.

1203
01:19:51,262 --> 01:19:52,646
Yeah, you are.

1204
01:19:54,799 --> 01:19:56,883
Why would you say that?

1205
01:19:56,918 --> 01:19:59,135
Because you just don't
care about anything.

1206
01:20:02,841 --> 01:20:04,875
I wish I didn't care
about anything.

1207
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:09,880
But I do care. I care
about everything too much.

1208
01:20:10,865 --> 01:20:12,349
What do you mean?

1209
01:20:12,383 --> 01:20:14,801
It's whatever, Teddy.

1210
01:20:14,836 --> 01:20:16,270
I think you're the one
who doesn't care, not me.

1211
01:20:18,038 --> 01:20:19,873
What do you mean?
I care about you.

1212
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,997
What? You...

1213
01:20:28,099 --> 01:20:29,933
You never even hang out with me.

1214
01:20:31,903 --> 01:20:33,220
Yeah, I love you.

1215
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,892
I love you.

1216
01:21:04,886 --> 01:21:07,821
<i> Do you remember that</i>
<i>night at the graveyard?</i>

1217
01:21:09,224 --> 01:21:11,058
<i>When we went to that tree?</i>

1218
01:21:11,092 --> 01:21:13,059
The one that
I carved a heart in?

1219
01:21:13,094 --> 01:21:14,928
Yeah.
That was fun.

1220
01:21:16,597 --> 01:21:17,898
That was fun.

1221
01:21:19,434 --> 01:21:21,202
I wish we could go
back to that night.

1222
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,772
You know that me and
Fred cut it down, right?

1223
01:21:25,323 --> 01:21:26,323
What?

1224
01:21:31,529 --> 01:21:33,730
That's so sad.
Yeah.

1225
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,268
That tree was probably there
since the Civil War.

1226
01:21:38,503 --> 01:21:39,903
And now it's gone.

1227
01:21:43,174 --> 01:21:44,241
It's kind of sad.

1228
01:21:46,077 --> 01:21:47,727
Come on, get in the pool.

1229
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,448
No. Come on, it feels great.

1230
01:21:51,482 --> 01:21:53,433
I'm shivering but not
because it's cold.

1231
01:21:53,467 --> 01:21:55,736
I'm shivering because
you're so beautiful.

1232
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,905
Not gonna work this time.

1233
01:21:59,056 --> 01:22:01,391
Emily, just get in the
fuckin' pool. No!

1234
01:22:01,426 --> 01:22:02,576
Get in the fuckin' pool, Emily.

1235
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:05,279
I'm not getting
in the fucking pool.

1236
01:22:05,313 --> 01:22:06,863
Get in the pool! I've
been excited about this!

1237
01:22:06,898 --> 01:22:08,432
Just get in, okay?

1238
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:10,901
Stop asking me. No!

1239
01:22:10,935 --> 01:22:12,336
Get in the pool, whore.

1240
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,372
You can be a real cunt,
you know that?

1241
01:22:15,407 --> 01:22:19,292
Just get in the
fucking pool, okay?

1242
01:22:19,326 --> 01:22:20,727
You know what, Fred?

1243
01:22:20,762 --> 01:22:22,495
What?

1244
01:22:22,514 --> 01:22:24,448
I thought I loved you but
you're a real... What?

1245
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:27,051
Fucking douchebag! I'm a what?
I'm a douche...

1246
01:22:31,839 --> 01:22:33,574
Fuck!

1247
01:22:33,608 --> 01:22:35,876
Got you!
Got you!

1248
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:40,114
What the fuck!

1249
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:47,121
What? What? What?

1250
01:22:47,155 --> 01:22:50,023
You made me do all those things!
I hate you! Come on. Come on.

1251
01:22:50,058 --> 01:22:52,492
Come on.
You set me up!

1252
01:22:52,526 --> 01:22:55,295
Come on, kiss me, kiss me, kiss,
me, kiss me, kiss me. Fuck you!

1253
01:22:55,329 --> 01:22:58,314
Sick and disgusting!

1254
01:23:01,636 --> 01:23:03,336
Are you gonna hit me with a bottle?
Don't!

1255
01:23:03,371 --> 01:23:04,471
You're gonna hit me with a bottle?
Don't!

1256
01:23:04,505 --> 01:23:05,438
Come on, hit me.
I dare you.

1257
01:23:05,473 --> 01:23:07,875
You wouldn't do it, pussy.
Pussy. Don't!

1258
01:23:07,909 --> 01:23:10,010
Pussy, pussy, pussy.
Stop!

1259
01:23:10,044 --> 01:23:12,246
Stop! You're not gonna hit
me with a fuckin' bottle.

1260
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:19,419
Ah.

1261
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:31,498
You bitch.
What the fuck!

1262
01:23:31,532 --> 01:23:32,933
I was just messing around.

1263
01:23:35,569 --> 01:23:36,970
Fuck!

1264
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:48,298
Teddy?

1265
01:23:51,102 --> 01:23:52,402
Let's go!

1266
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:06,382
Hey what's going on?
Can we have some stogs?

1267
01:24:08,185 --> 01:24:09,235
Sure.
Let me get one, too.

1268
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:14,007
Aren't you guys a little young
for drinking and smoking?

1269
01:24:14,041 --> 01:24:15,575
No, we like 'em.

1270
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:18,295
What? No. You guys
look younger than me.

1271
01:24:18,329 --> 01:24:20,330
How old are you?
Where are you from?

1272
01:24:20,364 --> 01:24:21,548
Around here.

1273
01:24:23,084 --> 01:24:25,301
I like your hair.
It's really pretty.

1274
01:24:25,336 --> 01:24:27,387
Thanks.

1275
01:24:27,421 --> 01:24:30,123
You want the last one? They
just took all my cigarettes.

1276
01:24:30,157 --> 01:24:32,425
Sucks.
I just bought this pack.

1277
01:24:32,459 --> 01:24:34,995
Well, at least now
you can make a wish.

1278
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:37,030
Remember you can make...
You can make your wish.

1279
01:24:38,983 --> 01:24:41,217
Oh. Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

1280
01:24:43,137 --> 01:24:44,170
What are you gonna wish for?

1281
01:25:01,556 --> 01:25:02,639
Are you okay, dude?
Yeah.

1282
01:25:02,673 --> 01:25:04,725
What happened?
Nothing just...

1283
01:25:04,759 --> 01:25:08,395
You okay. Yeah. Can we
go buy some weed please?

1284
01:25:08,429 --> 01:25:11,048
Yeah. Listen,
do you wanna come?

1285
01:25:11,349 --> 01:25:13,684
Oh, fuck. Can you give me
a fuckin' break, Teddy?

1286
01:25:13,718 --> 01:25:16,219
Skull's waiting for us to
buy some weed. Um, no.

1287
01:25:16,253 --> 01:25:18,288
I should probably wait here
so I can get a ride home.

1288
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:19,622
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah.

1289
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:23,242
Um...
Maybe tomorrow.

1290
01:25:23,277 --> 01:25:25,662
Yeah. I don't know
what you're doing...

1291
01:25:25,696 --> 01:25:29,115
I'll text you or something? Yeah, sure.
I'll text you.

1292
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:30,517
Or you can text me.

1293
01:25:30,551 --> 01:25:32,235
Thank you, April.
Let's go.

1294
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:35,071
Call you or... I mean... See you later.
Come on. Come on.

1295
01:25:45,699 --> 01:25:47,533
Dude, what do you... What
happened to your head?

1296
01:25:47,568 --> 01:25:49,736
What, uh...
What do you mean?

1297
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:51,371
I mean, what happened, dude?
Are you all right?

1298
01:25:51,405 --> 01:25:53,606
Yeah, I'm fine.

1299
01:25:53,641 --> 01:25:55,341
Who did that? Hey,
what would you do if,

1300
01:25:55,376 --> 01:25:56,977
if you were an Egyptian?

1301
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,248
I'd be a pharaoh.

1302
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:07,320
You can't be a fuckin' pharaoh.
Why not?

1303
01:26:07,355 --> 01:26:09,256
You can't be a fuckin' pharaoh.
Why not?

1304
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,427
I don't even want to
be Egyptian anyways.

1305
01:26:16,447 --> 01:26:19,382
All that sand and mummies
and shit, it's so boring.

1306
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:23,587
I'd be an Aztec or a Mayan.

1307
01:26:25,673 --> 01:26:28,074
Then I'd fucking
cut your heart out.

1308
01:26:29,594 --> 01:26:33,096
Hey, maybe we can
cut Skull's heart out.

1309
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,764
Skull would fuck you up.
Just rip it out of him.

1310
01:26:34,799 --> 01:26:37,467
He wouldn't be able
to fuck me up if I, uh,

1311
01:26:37,502 --> 01:26:39,335
stabbed him in
the stomach first.

1312
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:41,237
Stop. What the fuck?

1313
01:26:41,272 --> 01:26:43,507
What are you doing?
Stop.

1314
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:46,142
What are you doing, man?

1315
01:26:46,176 --> 01:26:48,645
Fred, fuck, dude. Put that thing...
Fuck. Stop.

1316
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:04,244
'Sup, Skull?

1317
01:27:04,278 --> 01:27:06,512
How are you doin'? How are you doin'?
Feel good?

1318
01:27:07,448 --> 01:27:08,514
Nice.

1319
01:27:11,118 --> 01:27:12,652
So you, uh, so you got it? Yes.

1320
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:17,240
Just a dime,
right? Want a hit?

1321
01:27:22,763 --> 01:27:24,114
Hey, Skull?

1322
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:28,451
Who'd you rather be
the pope or Pablo Escobar?

1323
01:27:28,453 --> 01:27:30,486
Escobar for sure, man.

1324
01:27:30,521 --> 01:27:32,539
Gets to have all
the fun.

1325
01:27:32,573 --> 01:27:34,374
The pope gets to
live in the Vatican.

1326
01:27:34,409 --> 01:27:35,642
He gets to see
Michelangelo all the time.

1327
01:27:35,676 --> 01:27:38,678
Escobar. What do you think?
Shut the fuck up, Teddy.

1328
01:27:38,713 --> 01:27:40,063
You know what you want?

1329
01:27:41,866 --> 01:27:43,667
You what a knife.
Huh?

1330
01:27:45,519 --> 01:27:50,306
This fucker could cut your heart
out, with this fucking knife.

1331
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,125
Cut your fucking heart out.

1332
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey...
He fucking said it to me.

1333
01:27:54,145 --> 01:27:56,846
You try it, I'll fucking kill you!
I never said that.

1334
01:27:56,881 --> 01:27:58,898
This fucker's always
saying weird shit

1335
01:27:58,932 --> 01:28:01,200
and trying to get me to kill people.
I don't...

1336
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:03,720
He want... He was talking about
cutting your heart out. I didn't...

1337
01:28:03,755 --> 01:28:05,355
Skull, Skull, Skull, Skull. Yes.

1338
01:28:06,758 --> 01:28:08,391
Would you rather
be gay or a girl?

1339
01:28:10,227 --> 01:28:12,195
Neither.

1340
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:15,899
No, I'm just saying if you had to.
Like, if a genie said so.

1341
01:28:15,933 --> 01:28:17,334
Both of them have to suck dick.

1342
01:28:17,368 --> 01:28:18,652
Exactly.

1343
01:28:18,686 --> 01:28:21,354
Would that be so bad?

1344
01:28:21,389 --> 01:28:23,623
I mean, don't you ever
get jealous of those

1345
01:28:23,658 --> 01:28:26,660
girls in pornos that get to be

1346
01:28:26,694 --> 01:28:28,628
on their knees in the middle
of all those fucking dicks.

1347
01:28:29,764 --> 01:28:32,365
Are you fuckin'
serious right now?

1348
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:34,384
Are you be... Are you being
fucking serious right now?

1349
01:28:34,419 --> 01:28:35,485
He's a fuckin' faggot.

1350
01:28:36,787 --> 01:28:40,256
He's always saying weird shit like this, dude.
No, no, no, no.

1351
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:42,275
This faggot is fucking serious.

1352
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:44,327
You don't like the idea of an
Around-The-World blow bang?

1353
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:46,947
No, I like to have
a girl suck my dick.

1354
01:28:46,981 --> 01:28:48,598
What's the difference?

1355
01:28:48,633 --> 01:28:50,901
"What the difference?"

1356
01:28:50,935 --> 01:28:52,769
Well, I'll tell
you the difference,

1357
01:28:52,803 --> 01:28:54,437
because I am going in

1358
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,724
and she's being got inside of.

1359
01:28:57,759 --> 01:29:01,895
Yeah, and why is one better? Why
does one make you better, Skull?

1360
01:29:01,929 --> 01:29:04,831
And why when you're inside
her, do you feel better?

1361
01:29:04,866 --> 01:29:07,567
I mean, aren't you
on her turf, inside her?

1362
01:29:07,601 --> 01:29:10,771
You know, isn't she
in control of you?

1363
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:13,907
Like a little fuckin' baby with
his mamma making him feel good.

1364
01:29:13,941 --> 01:29:14,641
Huh?

1365
01:29:15,576 --> 01:29:17,861
Skull, why? Why?

1366
01:29:17,895 --> 01:29:20,162
Because...
Because what?

1367
01:30:27,832 --> 01:30:29,599
Hey, dude.

1368
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:31,668
Hey, dude, dude,
dude, dude, dude.

1369
01:30:31,702 --> 01:30:33,369
Let's drive down the wrong way.

1370
01:30:34,806 --> 01:30:36,355
Fred, why do you
have to be like this?

1371
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:37,824
Why do I have to be like what?

1372
01:30:37,858 --> 01:30:40,794
Why do you have to be all
fucking crazy and psycho on me?

1373
01:30:42,797 --> 01:30:45,832
Why do you have to try so fucking hard
to seem crazy, man? I don't get it.

1374
01:30:47,819 --> 01:30:51,387
I just... I can't hang out
with you when you're like this.

1375
01:30:54,892 --> 01:30:56,592
Okay.

1376
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:06,669
I can't hang out with you
when you're like this.

1377
01:31:31,813 --> 01:31:33,847
Pull over.
Pull over.

1378
01:31:37,585 --> 01:31:40,319
Just let me out, dude.
Let me the fuck out.

1379
01:31:44,492 --> 01:31:45,792
Pull over, man.
Let me out.

1380
01:31:57,154 --> 01:31:58,788
What are you doing?

1381
01:32:57,964 --> 01:32:59,665
I'm not Bob.

1382
01:33:01,968 --> 01:33:03,602
I'm not Bob.

1383
01:33:05,889 --> 01:33:08,875
<i>I'm not Bob, I'm not Bob,
I'm not Bob.</i>

1384
01:33:13,063 --> 01:33:15,448
Let's go! Let's go!

1385
01:33:16,683 --> 01:33:18,151
I'm not Bob!
