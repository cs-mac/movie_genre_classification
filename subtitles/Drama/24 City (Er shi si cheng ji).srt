00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:33,856
Chengfa Group

2
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,951
The five-star red flag flutters in the wind

3
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:47,226
How glorious our song of victory

4
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:53,195
Singing for our beloved motherland

5
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,733
As she prospers and grows strong

6
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,806
CEREMONY FOR TRANSFER OF LAND

7
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,816
FROM CHENGFA GROUP TO CR LAND LTD

8
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,698
Dear Directors,
distinguished guests, good morning.

9
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,169
Today, 29 December 2007,

10
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,139
will mark a new and glorious chapter

11
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,540
in the development of the Chengfa Group.

12
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,203
For nearly 50 years
we have faced difficulties

13
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,478
and challenging breakthroughs
of economic reform.

14
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,850
Now a revitalized Chengfa Group

15
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,958
is about to move
from the site of the old factory...

16
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,028
The cherished hibiscus of 24 City,
in full bloom

17
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,962
Chengdu shone and prospered

18
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,521
Ancient poem

19
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:54,475
CHENGDU ClTY

20
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:34,423
He Xikun

21
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,692
Back then, we thought of 420
as a large factory.

22
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,825
But I knew that it did work for the military.

23
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,301
It made aircraft and aero engines.

24
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,806
We were fitters, our job was to repair

25
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,866
all the machinery and equipment in 420.

26
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,741
We were solely responsible for repairs.

27
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,079
We did regular maintenance
and repairs when necessary.

28
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,144
We took care of all that.

29
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,987
Back then, he was in charge

30
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,125
of Fitter Group 4.

31
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,058
There's one thing I remember...

32
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,625
I had just arrived.

33
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:22,001
I had no idea that the fitters
made their own tools.

34
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:27,639
One thing we used was called a scraper.

35
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,950
It was a kind of blade, shaped like this.

36
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,384
We had to make them ourselves.

37
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,480
When we received the metal,

38
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,321
we cut it and then honed the edge.

39
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,328
It was about this long.

40
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,298
As it got worn down and became this short,

41
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,925
we couldn't use it anymore.

42
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,235
But he kept on using them regardless.

43
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,069
When the thing was really worn out,

44
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,736
he hung it from his belt.

45
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,110
As you had to hone the edge,
the tool got all worn away.

46
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,344
Useless! But he kept on using it.

47
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,278
One time, a scraper was worn
right down so I threw it away.

48
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,555
Then Master Wang said: "Xiao He,

49
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,762
"you know that this small thing

50
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,494
"has come into our hands
through those of many others.

51
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,904
"lt can still be used."

52
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,071
So he picked it up,
re-honed it and used it again.

53
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,676
I was so impressed.

54
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,682
People like me were too immature.

55
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,976
We had to learn not to be wasteful.

56
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,317
Old masters like Master Wang knew well:

57
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,449
"Waste not want not".

58
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,293
He was right and I learned that from him.

59
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,927
He knew how many hands our tools
had passed through.

60
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,466
I feel guilty
when I speak about Master Wang.

61
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,034
For years, I've been so busy
that I haven't visited him.

62
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,117
He Xikun, born 1948 in Chengdu

63
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,124
Apprenticed in 1964 in Workshop 61

64
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,285
Later joined the army

65
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,428
He Xikun, male, aged 30

66
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,059
Work card 07718968

67
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:33,071
issued by State mechanic factory Xindu

68
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,131
During the clashes
of the Cultural Revolution,

69
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,368
factories and mines stopped work.

70
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,710
But he carried on working.

71
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,675
Hardly anyone went to the factory.

72
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,126
Talking about this

73
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,285
makes me feel a bit sad.

74
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,090
I would have died if you hadn't come.

75
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,197
She's hidden everything.

76
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,664
Hidden what? What was there to hide?

77
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,500
She mentioned a knife.

78
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,701
I can neither live nor die.
I have nothing left.

79
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,677
They took three X-rays.

80
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,048
After a long wait.

81
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,586
This hospital is hopeless.

82
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,385
They suggested we move
to the provincial hospital.

83
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,186
Were the X-rays computer-enhanced?

84
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,785
-So the images are clear?
-Think so.

85
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,040
What have you got to say?

86
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,274
What have you got to say?

87
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,415
You! What have you got to say?

88
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,726
Seeing you makes me a bit nervous.

89
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,487
Nervous?

90
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,158
Are you happy?

91
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,528
Happy to see me?

92
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,725
Of course I'm happy.

93
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,330
It's been so long.

94
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,303
Too bad!

95
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:59,333
I wouldn't have known you
if we'd passed on the street.

96
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,373
I wouldn't have known you.

97
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,482
Have I changed?

98
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,985
Look, I'm thinner.

99
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,851
Just like for those
who were in my workshop.

100
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,516
We greet each other when we meet.

101
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,518
But I forget.

102
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,520
My brain's rusty.

103
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,500
Too slow.

104
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,560
It was okay before.

105
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:29,367
I used to remember things well.
But not now.

106
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:34,335
You did a lot for the factory.

107
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,945
Back then,

108
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,918
when I started working here,
I used to worry.

109
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,954
I came here in 1959.

110
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,520
If I ever took a day off, I'd work nights

111
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,218
to make up.

112
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,730
I even worked through New Year
and on Sundays.

113
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,596
Every single day.

114
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,401
We were under pressure back then.

115
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,172
It was during the Korean war.

116
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,833
Right.

117
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,908
ALWAYS FOLLOW THE PATH
OF DEVELOPMENT CORRECTLY

118
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,781
WORK LOYALLY FOR OUR ARMY

119
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,653
Secretary Guan

120
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,633
Guan Fengjiu,
born 1935 in Haicheng, Liaoning

121
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,033
Head of security in Factory 420

122
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,300
Deputy secretary of Party Committee
when he retired

123
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:49,309
We were implementing
Chairman Mao's strategy.

124
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:54,744
Moving military factories to inland areas

125
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,050
sheltered by the mountains here.

126
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:01,757
Armament factories and the aeronautics
were in the north-east.

127
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,986
During the Korean War,
that was the front line against the Yanks.

128
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,890
In line with the new strategy,

129
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,402
we built factories in the south-west.

130
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,335
We picked this place.

131
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,440
We were under contract to Factory 111.

132
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,576
We repaired aircraft engines there,

133
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,985
MlG-15s during the Korean War.

134
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:34,458
They were used by the Chinese
and North Korean air forces

135
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,388
to fight American imperialism.

136
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:43,761
Factory 111 built Factory 420.

137
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,839
It was Factory 111...

138
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,434
On 3 November,
there was a general assembly.

139
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,278
Our factory was going
to build 420 in Chengdu.

140
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:01,445
We needed 60% of the staff,
That is, 60% of the Factory 111 staff.

141
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,751
We all had to move down here.

142
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:09,123
A certain amount of the equipment
from 111 was moved here

143
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,020
with the people to run it.

144
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,859
Various specialists,
technical staff, cadres mobilized.

145
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,702
The meeting was on 3 November,
I transferred in December.

146
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,900
I was in charge of the security section.

147
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,233
I was one of the first to arrive.

148
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,208
There were more
than four thousand workers.

149
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:03,706
HOU LlJUN

150
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,046
After Mom came here,

151
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,214
every year I thought of visiting home

152
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,385
to see my parents.

153
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:19,224
She wanted that too,
thought about it year on year.

154
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:24,395
But then... Job, family, kids!

155
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,904
Not to mention, the cost of it.

156
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,202
She couldn't afford to visit home.

157
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,500
Bottom line...

158
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,279
After coming here in 1958,

159
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,812
when did we first go back to Shenyang?

160
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,109
It was in 1972.

161
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,778
She had left in 1958.

162
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,617
Between 1958 and 1972, 14 years.

163
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,160
I was 18 or 19 by then.

164
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,326
I'd finished middle school.

165
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:56,191
Only then did I first go back
to Shenyang with Mom.

166
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,500
The first time back.

167
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,965
-Do you remember that trip?
-Sure I do.

168
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,635
I remember it vividly.

169
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,542
What was it like?

170
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,048
Well, it was...

171
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,013
Coming home like that...

172
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:22,183
It was 14 years since Mom had left.

173
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,990
As soon as we got there,

174
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,793
my Grandma and her husband
broke down in tears.

175
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:32,399
I was still too young to really understand.

176
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:37,067
I didn't appreciate why they felt so strongly.

177
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,537
I didn't understand what they felt.

178
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,341
Hou Lijun, born 1953 in Shenyang

179
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,581
Repairman in workshop 63 of Factory 420

180
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,763
And when we were about to leave,
they all said:

181
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,733
"We must take you to the station.
If you stay away this long again,

182
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,930
"we'll be more than 70 years old next time.

183
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,367
"Will there be another chance to meet?"

184
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,503
Then I understood
why Grandpa had cried like that.

185
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:19,379
When the train started moving,
Grandpa broke down in tears again.

186
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,909
As the train pulled out,
Mom kept her composure.

187
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,478
But me...

188
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,993
I began to cry myself.
On the train, I began sobbing out loud.

189
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:34,326
I felt so sorry for my grandparents.

190
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,630
Mom lived so far away
she couldn't visit them.

191
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,672
It was so hard for us to go back.

192
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,602
The great thing was
that Grandma was lucky.

193
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,747
Near the end of her life, she said:

194
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,077
"My greatest wish is to go to Chengdu

195
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:01,585
"to see my eldest daughter."
That is, my mother.

196
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,384
She finally came here in 1985.

197
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,762
At the age of 86, she finally made it.

198
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,461
The second year after she'd gone back...

199
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,968
The second year

200
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,565
she passed away.

201
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,148
How many in your own family?

202
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,747
We're a three-person family.

203
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,749
Standard size.

204
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,358
-Your husband works in the factory?
-Yes, he does.

205
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,361
-What's his job?
-A kind of

206
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,887
surface treatment in the coating workshop.

207
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,957
Surface treatment.

208
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,765
-You have a son or a daughter?
-A son.

209
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,142
When he was in the sixth grade
of primary school,

210
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,076
I was laid off.

211
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,449
-How old were you then?
-I was 41.

212
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,376
41 years old.

213
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,884
Was it a political decision
or some other reason?

214
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,294
Political, to reduce staff numbers.

215
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,025
They cut back and increased efficiency.

216
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,590
The factory needed fewer people,

217
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,104
so we were laid off.
I was one of the first to go.

218
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,901
I recall ten or so lay-offs in our workshop.

219
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,939
We had a last dinner together
at Hekouwei Restaurant.

220
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,244
He had booked many tables.

221
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,876
But that night we could hardly eat.

222
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,046
Manu couldn't eat, they just cried openly.

223
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,390
Everyone cried.

224
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,359
Everyone pulled at the hands

225
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,157
of Director Cao and Director Yang.

226
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,561
They said:

227
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,732
"I've never come late for work.

228
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,094
Director Cao agreed they hadn't.

229
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,237
"Was there ever a time
when I didn't do my best?"

230
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,936
Director Cao said: "Never."

231
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,407
In fact, nobody was in the wrong.

232
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,177
Nobody had come to work late
or not given their best.

233
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,209
Director Cao said I'd never failed at my job.

234
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,651
And I'd never come in late,
never made a mistake.

235
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,353
But they simply didn't need
so many people.

236
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,088
There was less work.
They were earning less money.

237
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,202
They couldn't support everyone.

238
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,930
They gave us all a small pay-off.

239
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,599
So we went home. As for the dinner...

240
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,340
We cried. Some of us didn't eat at all.

241
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,446
I ate just to encourage the others.

242
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,445
I was just pretending,

243
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,076
urging the other to tuck in.
That's what I did.

244
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:44,014
We call that "smiling through your tears".

245
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,214
That's what I did.

246
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,121
I kept telling them: "Why cry?

247
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,324
"Let's eat!"

248
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,633
In 1994, I was 41 years old.

249
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,433
I'd left school at middle school.

250
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,065
A 41-year-old woman.

251
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,071
My kid was in the sixth grade.

252
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,113
I had to pay his tuition fees
and feed three people.

253
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,050
I had just about...

254
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,678
200 yuan to live on.

255
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,954
When I went out job-hunting,

256
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,130
I put up a motto on the wall.

257
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,829
It read like this:

258
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:39,039
"Come rain, come shine,
I must go forward."

259
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,670
I went out looking for a job every day.

260
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,381
Always had my motto in mind.

261
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,180
Anyhow, I went out looking for work.

262
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,317
I tried all over Chengdu.

263
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,287
Again and again.

264
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,761
I tried at the Job Center.

265
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,292
In Chengdu City, there's a Job Center

266
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,959
in the Workers' Cultural Palace.

267
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,627
You sign up there.

268
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,367
You look everywhere, you ask friends...

269
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,636
Maybe an old friend has work for you.

270
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,610
It's so hard, really not easy to find a job.

271
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,152
I couldn't find one

272
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,313
so I tried selling on the street.

273
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:31,050
What did I sell?
I sold yellow michelia flowers.

274
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,794
You can wear them in your buttonhole.

275
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,389
I sold that.

276
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,903
Early every morning,
I bought them at Qingshi Bridge.

277
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,131
I set up on Dongfeng Road

278
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,698
by a little tree. I had to be discreet.

279
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,501
If the cops or the city inspectors saw me,

280
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,706
they would confiscate the flowers.

281
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,111
Later, thanks to some friends...

282
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,982
Yes, thanks to some friends...

283
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:00,115
I was introduced to other jobs.
Slowly, step by step.

284
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,424
Are you working now?

285
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,327
Nowadays?

286
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,991
I do some sewing at home. I'm retired.

287
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:13,003
I have a pension, but I still do some sewing.

288
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,005
-You do what?
-I sew.

289
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,975
I sew at home.

290
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,534
Didn't you notice that at my home?

291
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,837
I put up the sign "Sewing" at my window.

292
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,049
I still do a bit of that at home.

293
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,246
Just a little. I like it.

294
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,482
I earn some money
and have something to do.

295
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,061
If you have something to do,
you age more slowly.

296
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,599
If you have something to do,
you age more slowly

297
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,804
I have a date tonight

298
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:04,579
I will not sleep tonight

299
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:09,958
When the bell sounds
across space and time

300
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,623
It wakes the new millennium

301
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:19,834
Come, dear friends

302
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:24,102
Come, fellow workmates

303
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:33,099
Regulations for retired persons'
cultural room

304
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,717
WANTED

305
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:18,949
Dormitory area in Factory 420

306
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,162
Dali, going out?

307
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,732
Feel better?

308
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,535
Much better.

309
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:55,745
Dali

310
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,720
Aunty, I'll hang it for you.

311
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,623
Please.

312
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,867
You called me "aunty"?

313
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,766
You should call me "granny".

314
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,907
Granny.

315
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,243
This Director Song, has he come yet?

316
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,982
He has.
He's probably in a meeting with the bosses.

317
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,528
Are you new here?

318
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,564
Yes. I just graduated.

319
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,965
You can wear make-up to work?

320
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:30,234
Foreign enterprises expect you to,
or they won't hire you.

321
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:36,374
Isn't this state-owned?

322
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:53,060
Factory 420 was a state secret.

323
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,598
The original name was Xindu Machinery.

324
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,426
Later it became the Chengfa Group.

325
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,831
Its code name has been 420 all along.

326
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,935
Like a military designation.
That never changed.

327
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,908
I remember when we got our wage packets,

328
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,783
there was a 5 yuan bonus for secrecy.

329
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,321
Pretty good!

330
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,358
Around 1960,

331
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,855
at the time of the natural disasters,

332
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,330
people didn't have enough to eat.

333
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:34,830
But our factory gave us each
1.5 kilos of meat every month.

334
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,504
Our work was vital, aeronautical stuff.

335
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,142
No negligence.

336
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,581
Hao Dali, worker in Factory 420

337
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:55,092
Held the national title of March 8th
Red Banner Holder

338
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,596
Factory Xindu staff canteen

339
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,033
Vegetable Ration Coupon

340
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:09,069
I still remember that on pay days,

341
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,040
the bank set up a desk at the factory gate.

342
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:19,075
It was just a table really
for us to deposit our wages.

343
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:23,352
Back in 1975, I earned 58 yuans.

344
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,281
I deposited 30 yuan every month.

345
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,487
I fed my family

346
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,757
and sent some money back to Shenyang.

347
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:38,361
My sister lived in a village,
she had many children.

348
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:42,429
So I sent her all my old clothes.

349
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,203
She altered them for her kids.

350
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,203
The factory provided us

351
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,544
with uniforms, work-gloves,
that kind of thing.

352
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,915
I never threw them away.
I collected the used gloves

353
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,020
and I sent them to my sister.

354
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,783
She washed them, unraveled the thread,

355
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,292
made balls of it,

356
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:08,421
and wove clothes, trousers

357
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,725
for my nephews.

358
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,034
This year, my sister...

359
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,247
Her youngest son, actually,
sent me 500 yuans.

360
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,184
So I rang my sister

361
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,722
and asked her:
"Why are you sending me money?

362
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,719
"What for?"

363
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:39,861
She answered:
"l know things are tough in your factory."

364
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,402
My sister's son lives in the village.

365
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,874
He runs a small grocery store.
It gives him some extra income.

366
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,307
It never crossed my mind

367
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,782
that I'd need help from my sister in old age.

368
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,823
When did you join the factory?

369
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,354
Factory 420, in 1958.

370
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,466
From Shenyang, we moved here in groups.

371
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,467
I was in the last group.

372
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:25,168
My boy was three years old.

373
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,204
I was 18 when he was born.

374
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,254
So I'd be 21! Yes, 21 that year.

375
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,153
Not quite an adult, in fact.

376
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:44,227
I'd never left home before,
I'd never been on a boat.

377
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:49,460
That year,
the Chengdu-Baoji railway collapsed.

378
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:53,431
No route overland, so we came by river.

379
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:59,033
First a train to Dalian,
then a boat to Shanghai.

380
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,909
Then we took a river-boat

381
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:05,244
along the Yangtze to Chongqing.

382
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,177
And then a bus from Chongqing
to Chengdu.

383
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,488
It took 15 days to get to Chengdu.

384
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:21,661
As we approached Goddess Peak,

385
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:25,031
there was thick fog that day.

386
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,900
We went on deck,

387
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,306
but we couldn't see anything. Nothing at all.

388
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:37,342
I'd never been on a boat before.
I felt seasick and threw up.

389
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:41,742
All around me, it was chaotic on the boat.

390
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,854
My husband suggested
that I rest for a while.

391
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,956
But I couldn't sleep.
There were kids running around.

392
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,363
I still felt seasick. Still kept throwing up.

393
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,729
And the boat was juddering.

394
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,432
Not easy. We finally reached Fengjie.

395
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:06,075
In Fengjie, we docked on the wharf.

396
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:11,972
We went on land.
They gave us two hours there.

397
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,244
It was nice to take a breather.

398
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,050
But the boat was carrying
important equipment.

399
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,182
So we couldn't stay long.

400
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:26,863
During the short stop, it was really...

401
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,597
Everyone went ashore.

402
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,829
We were a small community,
everyone knew each other.

403
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,039
So I was off-guard.

404
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:45,243
They sounded the first siren.

405
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,547
It meant that there was
half an hour to departure.

406
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,513
My husband and l

407
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:55,616
were buying some local specialties
and some oranges.

408
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,954
I suddenly thought about my boy.

409
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,266
He wasn't with me anymore.

410
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:08,631
I panicked and started calling him.

411
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,930
I called and called.

412
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,039
But I couldn't find him.

413
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,578
I panicked.
My husband tried to reassure me:

414
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:22,107
"Maybe he went back to the boat
with the other kids."

415
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:25,519
So we went to the boat
to see if he was there.

416
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,049
All the other kids were back.

417
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,059
All the other families were together.

418
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,258
Except us.

419
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,128
My husband panicked too.

420
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,868
He called his workmates.

421
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,866
They looked for him everywhere.

422
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,542
I was at my wits' end.

423
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,413
My husband and I rushed back ashore
to look for him.

424
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,276
But we couldn't find him.

425
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,658
And then,

426
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,424
the second siren sounded.

427
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,760
Some women comrades

428
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,170
dragged me back to the boat.

429
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:21,037
When we were transferred
from Shenyang to Chengdu,

430
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,943
we were working for the military.

431
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,440
Part of the war effort.

432
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,121
Everything we did had implications
for national security.

433
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,850
That made me all the more nervous.

434
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:37,685
They said Chiang Kai-Shek
was going to invade China.

435
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,663
So when that siren sounded,

436
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,390
it was like an army bugle.

437
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,936
We had to go.

438
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,244
Then

439
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:07,487
a big crowd of people
dragged me back to the boat.

440
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,386
I leaned on the railings.

441
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,425
The boat went farther offshore,
the houses turned smaller.

442
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:21,269
I felt that my child
got farther and farther away.

443
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,535
I hated myself so much.

444
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,834
My heart was flurried.

445
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,712
It was empty.

446
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,787
Jaguar! The Commies are taking the bait!

447
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,701
The Commies are taking the bait!
Captain Morgan...

448
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,336
Act in good faith!

449
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:33,969
Second!

450
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,774
A flotilla of small planes on the right!

451
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,716
Enemy planes in the south-west!

452
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,149
Enemy planes in the west!

453
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,455
It's clear, enemy tactics have changed.

454
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,122
They're using small planes as decoys

455
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,165
and surrounding us with big ones.

456
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,824
Very crafty!

457
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,734
Captain!

458
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,771
The bombers have crossed sector 2.

459
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,404
Captain!

460
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,974
Bombing as originally planned.

461
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,378
OBSERVE SAFETY, TREASURE LlFE

462
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:21,809
If the aeronautics factory
is like a huge eyeball

463
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:29,220
The laboring is its pupil

Song Weidong

466
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,060
The money we get selling this land

467
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,763
will be used to build a new industrial park.

468
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:25,136
Our workshops will move there, one by one.

469
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:29,209
Our offices here will become
a five-star hotel.

Song Weidong, born 1966 in Chengdu

471
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:41,254
Assistant to General Manager
of Chengfa Group

472
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:47,363
Factory 420, the whole of it,

473
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,163
was quite large.

474
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,335
The whole place was a kind of world apart.

475
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,499
Take me, for example.

476
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,233
From kindergarten,

477
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,778
primary school, middle school, high school,

478
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:09,950
I always attended the schools
for the workers' children.

479
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,715
It was the same for all the other kids.

480
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,585
Within the factory precincts,
there was a cinema, a swimming pool.

481
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:20,590
In the summer,
the factory made its own soft drinks.

482
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,565
Each family took bottles
to bring them home.

483
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,494
We were proud of the factory.

484
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,802
420 had almost no connection
with Chengdu City.

485
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,074
We thought

486
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:37,102
we didn't need the local people.

487
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,841
No need. We had a great life.

488
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,209
The only way we connected with local kids

489
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,482
was through fights.

490
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,657
The eastern suburbs

491
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:55,088
had a history of fighting
even before Liberation.

492
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:58,562
There were a lot of pitched battles here.

493
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:02,905
We took on the local kids,

494
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,339
there were non-stop conflicts and clashes.

495
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:10,536
Often near the double bridge.
We almost always won.

496
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,172
We outnumbered them
and were all from one place.

497
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,718
Whereas they were much less unified.

498
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,378
But they hit on a strategy.

499
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,589
Quite a strategy.

500
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,555
Ambushes. They'd hide somewhere

501
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,360
and if we were alone or in a small group,

502
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,130
they'd ambush us and beat us.

503
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,567
And then we'd counter-attack.

504
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,800
If you beat me today,
tomorrow I'll beat you back.

505
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,975
I remember one time in particular.

506
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,981
I was in grade three.

507
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:49,643
In 1976.

508
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,521
I'd just learned how to ride a bike.

509
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:56,184
One afternoon
I took my father's bike, a Phoenix 28.

510
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,528
I took it and rode it away.

511
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:03,260
I rode the bike a long way
and found myself in another sector.

512
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,927
I had left the zone of influence
of Factory 420.

513
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,470
I turned around at once.

514
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,005
Too late! A gang of boys trapped me.

515
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:15,339
They caught me
and escorted me to their base.

516
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,539
They had a leader, another kid.

517
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,079
His name is Zhou Chao.

518
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:24,085
I was taken before him fearing the worst.

519
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:28,513
The kids were jeering me.
As in some movie, they said:

520
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,923
"On behalf of the masses,
I sentence you to death."

521
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,259
I was sure they were going to beat me up.

522
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:39,194
I just wanted my bike, I had to get it back.

523
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:44,130
To my surprise, Zhou Chao said to me:

524
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,565
"I've thought it over,

525
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,272
"Premier Zhou Enlai passed away today.

526
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,881
"So I'll let you off."

527
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,307
Then he and his boys left.

528
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,080
I was amazed.

529
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:01,283
I rode home in a hurry. When I got there,

530
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:05,055
I found my parents making
little white paper flowers.

531
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,119
Premier Zhou had really passed away.

532
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:16,538
I went through puppy love too. I was 16.

533
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:19,641
In grade two of High School.

534
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,540
High School used to be two years.

535
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,113
When I graduated, I had a girlfriend.

536
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:29,116
Her family was also from the north-east.

537
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:33,582
She was offered a place
in South-West Medical College.

538
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,792
I wanted to go to university too
but my family didn't agree

539
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,929
because our factory offered
really good benefits to its staff.

540
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:47,095
And I might be assigned
to somewhere else after graduating.

541
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,207
So they insisted that I take
my father's place eventually.

542
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:54,037
I had to learn his skills.

543
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,940
So I stayed in the factory.

544
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,014
Back then,
our factory was really pretty good.

545
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,217
In 1978, after the Cultural Revolution,

546
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,254
there was a war against Vietnam.

547
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:09,418
They needed a lot of munitions.
But after that, there was a decline.

548
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,686
The factory profits went down.

549
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:17,129
So her family wanted her to break with me.

550
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:19,028
One day,

551
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:22,663
I remember very clearly,

552
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,166
she broke up with me.

553
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,441
I was roller skating.

554
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,571
She came to find me.

555
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:33,548
There was a wire netting
around the skating rink,

556
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:36,586
a wire-netting barrier. I was inside it.

557
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,850
She was outside. She had an ice popsicle.

558
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,592
She passed it to me over the railing.

559
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,063
I'd taken two bites from it

560
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,598
when she came out with it. She said:

561
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,462
"We're so young,

562
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,465
"our love is so immature."

563
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,642
I understood it right away.

564
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:04,271
I interrupted her and said:

565
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,406
"So it's over between us."

566
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:11,376
And she said: "You said it first."

567
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,425
She implied it was my decision.

568
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,960
I said: "Yes, I said it first."

569
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,094
Then she left.

570
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,392
She didn't look back.

571
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,526
I remember one thing very strongly.

572
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:30,470
There was a Japanese TV show
called Red Suspicion

573
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,242
with Yamaguchi Momoe

574
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,403
in the role of Sachiko.
I remember her hairstyle.

575
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:40,448
My girlfriend had Sachiko hair.

576
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,845
She left without looking back.

577
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,827
When she gave me the ice popsicle,

578
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,458
tied around her wrist, she had

579
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,465
a red handkerchief.

580
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,965
I remember it clearly.

581
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:05,764
A few days ago on Hunan TV,
they showed Red Suspicion again.

582
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,907
My wife...

583
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,106
She was the file manager in the factory.

584
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,715
She watches TV series every evening.
She loves them.

585
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,287
I watch them with her.

586
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,418
-Which year were you born?
-1970.

587
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:27,156
I was born in 1966.

588
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:12,965
Though leaves are many,
the root is only one

589
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:18,175
Through all the lying days of my youth

590
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,844
I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun

591
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,856
Now I may wither into the truth

592
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,220
W. B. Yeats

593
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:51,980
Site for stage one of 24 City

594
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,778
(Former factory basketball court)

595
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,282
Buildings in basketball court

596
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,986
These machines will be moved
in three days.

597
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,963
Every day

598
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:25,125
I am wandering

599
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:29,700
Every morning and night my heart is adrift

600
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,374
How I long for someone to be with me

601
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:39,643
To make my heart stop drifting

602
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:47,079
The day you come

603
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:51,183
Will you tell me tenderly

604
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:55,755
That you accept to be the one

605
00:58:56,065 --> 00:59:00,525
I want to be sure that the person before me

606
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:04,664
Will be faithful to her promises

607
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:02,828
Sister Lin comes down from heaven

608
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:09,361
Like a wispy cloud
from behind the mountain

609
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,842
He who loves her seems
outwardly dissolute

610
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,971
But he is actually pure in heart

611
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:22,643
This young lady is graceful like
a flower gazing at itself in the wave

612
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:27,452
She moves delicately
like the wind in the willows

613
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:31,653
Her eyes give off a mysterious charm

614
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:36,461
Her voice and her smile
reflect her tender soul

615
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:39,626
This person seems to be from far away

616
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:46,631
Yet my heart thinks
it recognizes an old friend

617
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,679
Little Flower,

618
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:59,153
you brought nothing to eat this morning?

619
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:01,213
We went up Qingcheng Hill yesterday.

620
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,383
I'm tired, I don't feel like cooking.

621
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:07,793
So you'll go out to eat?
Does your brother like spicy food?

622
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,692
Yes, he does.

623
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,564
He's been everywhere
and tasted everything.

624
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:16,366
Before Liberation,
Shanghai had Sichuan restaurants.

625
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,464
My Grandpa used to say

626
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:22,309
the Jinjiang Hotel
served good Sichuan food.

627
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:26,678
He also said Sichuan food
was fashionable in Shanghai.

628
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,580
-You know why?
-No.

629
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:33,850
During the war against Japan,
Sichuan was at the back.

630
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:37,757
Many Shanghainese fled into Sichuan.

631
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,227
When they went home after the war,

632
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:43,754
they saw themselves as war heroes.

633
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:49,434
They ate spicy food in public
to show they'd been in Sichuan.

634
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,176
Shanghai has changed a lot.

635
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,143
I went back once in 1993.

636
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,204
There's a street where they serve lamb stew.

637
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,774
I never ate lamb when I was young.

638
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:04,945
It was always cooked with garlic.

639
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,055
Where are you two going to eat?

640
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:13,221
My brother went to Shanghai this morning.
His unit called him.

641
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:18,330
I'll be off, Little Flower.
I need to get changed.

642
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:29,478
Little Flower

643
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:38,843
Little Flower, do you get nervous?

644
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,617
Not usually, only when I'm in costume.

645
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:44,854
Sister Wang,
can you bring my bag upstairs?

646
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,555
I left my phoenix in it.

647
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:19,755
Beside the green lake

648
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:25,358
Under flowing willows

649
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:32,704
Along the flower-strewn path

650
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,203
The burial of flowers
(Dream of the Red Chamber)

651
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,372
Yue Opera

652
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:44,416
Out of nowhere

653
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:49,251
A flute's lament

654
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:57,356
Is heard in the breeze

655
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:43,640
For me it was in 1978.

656
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:47,408
I was assigned to 420
from the Shanghai Aviation Academy.

657
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:53,078
Around graduation time we heard
some of us would be sent to Chengdu.

658
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:56,021
Those who didn't want to go

659
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,126
used their connections to stay in Shanghai.

660
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,023
But I didn't.

661
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:06,458
That was when those who'd been sent
to the country began getting back.

662
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:09,035
My brother came back from Jiangxi,

663
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:13,536
my elder sister, from Heilongjiang
and my second sister, from Anhui.

664
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:16,234
So the family was reunited.

665
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,273
And the house was full of people.

666
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:23,543
With them three
and my kid brother in high school,

667
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,176
there were seven of us in all.

668
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:29,848
The house was only 20 meters,
how could seven of us live there?

669
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:35,093
We had to divide each room in half.

670
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,623
And we built a temporary attic.

671
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:42,465
We say "an elephant
in the stomach of a sparrow".

672
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:49,510
I slept in the attic with my sisters.

673
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:54,243
So I thought I should leave.

674
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,278
At that time,

675
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:04,224
there were far more men than women
in Factory 420.

676
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,856
Girls from Shanghai like me were very few.

677
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,530
On my first day at work,
I went to Canteen 2 for lunch.

678
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:19,298
It was terribly crowded.

679
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:23,534
I later found out the men
who ate in Canteens 1 and 3

680
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,546
had come to see the girls from Shanghai.

681
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:31,910
Especially the younger men,
they made comments about us.

682
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:38,989
Things like that went on
for quite some time.

683
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:47,928
Later some guy, I never knew who,

684
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,903
gave me the nickname
"Standard Component".

685
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,798
What did that mean?

686
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:57,302
At first, I had no idea what it meant.

687
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,005
Later I came to know

688
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:03,609
it meant "flower of the factory".

689
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:12,386
After that, people began calling me
"Little Flower".

690
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:16,029
There was a movie called "Little Flower",

691
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:19,794
with Joan Chen, Tang Guoqiang
and Liu Xiaoqing.

692
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:24,335
Our factory showed that movie
for a whole week.

693
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,372
Many people saw it several times.

694
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:30,405
They came out saying
I looked like Little Flower,

695
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,605
the heroine, played by Joan Chen.

696
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,876
At first, they used the name

697
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,011
behind my back. Then, to my face.

698
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:44,058
After a while, my real name
was known to very few people.

699
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,125
What is your real name?

700
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,821
Gu Minhua.

701
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:52,525
"Hua" as in Zhonghua, China.

702
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:55,663
I guess you had many admirers.

703
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,045
Back then,

704
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,244
people weren't as open as they are now.

705
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,443
And everyone was so busy,
overtime every day.

706
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,717
One time,

707
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:22,224
on the workshop notice board,

708
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,628
someone put up a photo.

709
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,830
There was no caption.

710
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:33,801
It showed a young guy,
good-looking, sporty type.

711
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:39,341
During break times,
we all gathered round to look at it.

712
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:43,615
Some of the girls began guessing
who he might be.

713
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:48,655
Some thought he was from the Youth
League and due to visit the factory.

714
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:51,788
Others thought he was our representative

715
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:54,762
to comfort the army in Vietnam.

716
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:57,730
Staring and speculating
went on day after day.

717
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,267
Then it went even further.

718
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:02,893
"Little Flower,

719
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:07,272
"This guy is
as handsome as Tang Guoqiang.

720
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,343
"You two would make a beautiful a couple."

721
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:14,980
My colleagues in the factory
were all matchmakers.

722
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,146
Two people who had nothing in common,

723
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:22,850
if they had matching names,
would make a good couple to us.

724
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,056
Some of them really did get married.

725
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:30,531
I was pretty annoyed at first.
I thought: "How dare they

726
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:34,864
"try to match a living person with a photo?"

727
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:41,141
But later, very gradually,

728
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:45,345
my thinking began to change.

729
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:51,076
I imagined he really was coming
to our factory.

730
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:55,486
In fact I imagined him
turning up the very next day.

731
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:59,761
I was 20 years old.

732
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,888
I'd never been in love.

733
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:10,705
Some days later, there was
a big meeting in the factory.

734
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:13,069
The leaders asked us

735
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,178
if we'd seen the photo.

736
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,243
Did we know who the man was?

737
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,245
Everybody stayed silent.

738
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,347
The Party Secretary said

739
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:27,785
the man was a pilot our country
had trained for eight years,

740
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:31,016
which had cost more than 200,000 yuans.

741
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,961
Something went wrong with his plane.

742
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:39,925
Trying to save the plane,
he didn't parachute to safety.

743
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,470
He was just 24.

744
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:45,606
The Secretary went on:

745
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:50,305
"The accident happened

746
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:55,482
"because some components we'd produced

747
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:59,345
"had gone wrong."

748
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,849
He added: "Amongst you

749
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,958
"there's someone who was responsible
for this tragedy."

750
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:09,762
We should reflect on our mistakes.

751
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:20,163
After that,
many people introduced boys to me.

752
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,338
I started going out with a boy.

753
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,916
He taught on the factory's
educational TV channel.

754
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:33,315
The son of high-ranking officials
who worked in the ministries.

755
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,514
Good family background.

756
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,887
But then something bad happened.

757
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:44,230
In neighboring workshop 34,
there was a guy

758
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,935
who was apparently in love with me.

759
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:53,098
He wrote love letters to himself in my name.

760
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:55,005
Hard to understand, isn't it?

761
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:58,238
He wrote love letters to himself

762
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,577
and signed my name at the end: Gu Minhua.

763
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:06,881
Then he showed off the letters
to his workmates.

764
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,147
Soon enough, everyone was talking

765
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:13,193
about our supposed love affair.

766
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,489
And everyone thought I'd taken the lead.

767
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,996
My boyfriend heard about this
and got quite angry.

768
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:25,400
I tried to explain to him,
but he wouldn't listen.

769
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:30,934
So I had no choice
but to break up with him.

770
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:43,491
After that, I decided to go back to Shanghai.

771
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:50,197
If I got married in Chengdu
that would be an obstacle.

772
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,301
The easiest way to move
was to make an exchange.

773
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,666
I had to find someone in Shanghai

774
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,296
who wanted to move to Chengdu.

775
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:03,804
But by 1984 or 1985, the war was over.

776
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:07,404
Armaments manufacture fell on hard times.
I found no one.

777
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:11,815
Those were hard years for the factory.

778
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:15,690
Later on, the plant moved over
to civilian products.

779
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:21,987
Double Swallow brand fridges
and washing machines.

780
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,622
Suddenly we needed sales people.

781
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,065
As I was from Shanghai,

782
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:29,227
they made me a saleswoman there.

783
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:33,205
I drank with clients every day.
It ruined my stomach.

784
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:35,503
And I wasn't making money for myself.

785
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,612
So I took unpaid leave
and started my own company.

786
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:44,444
I did some business,
but I didn't get very far.

787
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:48,084
I was a wholesaler of Tianfu peanuts.

788
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:54,192
I found it quite tough
so I moved back to Chengdu.

789
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,365
By 1989, when I got back here,

790
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,499
my sisters already had kids in school.

791
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,537
So I thought I might as well marry
a Chengdu man.

792
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,112
Well...

793
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:16,908
I was in my thirties by then.

794
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,452
I was only introduced to divorced men.

795
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:24,181
The thought of being a step-mother

796
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,051
made me uncomfortable.

797
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,560
So I passed on all of them.

798
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,095
I was introduced to another one recently.

799
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:38,404
Good in all respects. He's a boss.

800
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,936
But after we'd met a couple of times,

801
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,641
he told me something.

802
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:48,542
He'd been a mason when he was young.

803
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:52,414
He'd passed our factory gate,
pulling trolley-loads of stones.

804
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:56,021
He'd seen me often and knew
I was the flower of the factory.

805
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:57,723
He liked me a lot.

806
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,360
But he was poor then.

807
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,392
And the factory had a high reputation.

808
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:09,666
So he felt that I was beyond his reach.

809
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:15,106
But he promised himself
he'd come to me when he got rich.

810
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:20,045
Hearing all this made very uncomfortable.

811
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:25,014
Maybe I'm no longer
a "standard component",

812
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:28,452
but I'm not a "reject" either.

813
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:32,625
I have my own standards.

814
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:37,359
I thought it over and ended it.

815
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,098
Now I'm single,

816
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:50,206
I live a happy life.

817
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,075
Some of my workmates who married

818
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:57,083
are now divorced.

819
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,687
They live alone, just as I do.

820
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,793
We go out to sing karaoke,

821
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:09,022
we play mahjong. It's fun.

822
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:30,048
Gu Minhua, born 1958 in Shanghai

823
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:33,986
Worked as quality inspector at Factory 420

824
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:42,855
Film "Little Flower", 1978

825
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:47,425
A girl is looking for her beloved

826
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:51,327
She is sad, tears in her eyes

827
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:57,074
She cannot see him
Sadness grips her heart

828
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:01,539
Sadness grips her heart

829
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:07,048
Why do you blame me
for being thus afflicted?

830
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,987
Half of me cherishes the spring

831
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:12,185
The other half despises it

832
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:18,726
Dream of the Red Chamber

833
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:25,763
Poem - The burial of flowers

834
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,860
Young lady!

835
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:59,427
-What's your name?
-Yang Mengyue.

836
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:02,463
-ln school?
-Third grade.

837
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,064
Anyone in your family in Factory 420?

838
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:09,234
That one? Yes. My Pa and Ma work there.

839
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,111
-Ever been there yourself?
-No.

840
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:44,265
China Resources Land Ltd: 24 City

841
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,208
The land area of Chengdu City
is still expanding.

842
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:58,042
The center of the city was
no longer suitable for a factory.

843
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,644
CR Land Ltd is spending

844
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:03,616
2. 14 billion yuan to redevelop the 56 ha.

845
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,911
Soon a modern, living community,
named 24 City

846
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:08,785
will arise on this site.

847
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:13,021
Factory 420 will use the money
to modernize its technology.

848
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:16,058
Its aeronautics technology
will not become obsolete...

849
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,866
Zhao Gang

850
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:30,034
These white bits
are for housing developments.

851
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,679
The gray bits are for commercial use.

852
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:35,806
And in the south-west corner,
these red bits

853
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,579
are the buildings

854
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:40,644
from the old factory that we'll retain,

855
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,020
Iike the old mill buildings
and the watchtower.

856
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,993
Why is it called 24 City?

857
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,959
It comes from an old poem:
"The cherished hibiscus

858
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:55,400
"of 24 city in full bloom
Chengdu shone and prospered"

859
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:57,562
We have other models.

860
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,468
-Will you follow me?
-Thank you.

861
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:13,979
Over here.

862
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,651
Zhao Gang, born 1974

863
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:22,219
News round-up presenter on Chengdu TV

864
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,475
I was a student
in the College of Technology.

865
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,505
Our teacher introduced us and gave us

866
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:44,608
the rail tickets from Chengdu to Jilin.

867
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,450
We'd never been on a train.

868
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:51,659
We were told to give the tickets
to our parents.

869
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:55,488
They were scared we'd lose them.

870
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,827
It was the kind of ticket
they had in the 1980s,

871
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:00,800
a through ticket,

872
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:04,367
all the way from Chengdu to Jilin.

873
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:08,067
I looked at it and was amazed to see

874
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,677
one station en route was Beijing.

875
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:14,270
I'd never been to Beijing,
I was really surprised.

876
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:18,385
It meant I was going a lot further
than 20 miles.

877
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:22,114
I was really leaving Chengdu.

878
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:28,118
We were in a state of excitement
all the way to Jilin.

879
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:31,265
The semester began on 1 September.

880
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:34,759
I looked forward to it.
It snows in Jilin, right?

881
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,436
First time in the north-east.

882
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:41,741
Everything was exciting.
I spent that semester

883
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:46,773
Iearning new things non-stop like
one who'd never left the family.

884
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:49,040
Everything was great.

885
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:54,015
I compared my life in Chengdu
with life in Jilin.

886
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:57,454
Compared with Factory 420,

887
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:01,289
the environment I grew up in,
this was very different.

888
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:06,125
Chi Chin's song The Outside World
expresses my feelings.

889
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,527
-Had it come out then?
-ln 1990, I think.

890
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,003
It was so great. Just great.

891
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:17,141
After the first semester,

892
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,907
my thinking changed a lot.

893
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:22,539
The first half-semester

894
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:27,417
was all theory, heat treatment
of metals, engine building...

895
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:31,013
In the second half-semester, three months,

896
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,721
I did an apprenticeship
and had to put on work clothes.

897
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:38,298
My whole attitude changed.

898
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:42,300
As a kid, I'd watched my father
put on his uniform.

899
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,106
At the time,

900
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,698
only policemen and soldiers wore uniforms.

901
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:53,709
I was always impressed
when I saw people in uniforms.

902
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:55,679
It meant high social status.

903
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:59,253
So I liked factory uniforms.

904
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:03,652
But when I put on the work clothes
the teacher gave me,

905
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:06,888
I didn't feel any different.

906
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:10,727
Took my lunch-box,
with a spoon rattling inside

907
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:14,433
and went to the factory.

908
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:16,627
Once there, things changed.

909
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,966
Your status was different.

910
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:23,233
You'd been a student.

911
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,610
You'd seen workers, right?

912
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:31,082
Now you were wearing work clothes.
It was not the same.

913
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:35,549
I remember one episode
that really affected me.

914
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:39,792
Another boy from Chengdu and l

915
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,026
were apprentices to a north-easterner.

916
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:45,560
He taught us metal polishing
with a big stone wheel.

917
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,732
He gave us a basketful of parts

918
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:53,432
straight off the production line.

919
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:56,005
Our job, he told us,

920
01:26:56,211 --> 01:27:01,148
was to smooth away the rough edges
of these component parts.

921
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:04,317
I'm quite a sensitive guy.

922
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:09,115
I did 10 or 20.
I guess I thought it was quite interesting.

923
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:12,188
I focused on the technical skills.

924
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:16,358
But when you've done 50 or 100 of them,

925
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:20,827
something snaps in your mind.

926
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:24,303
You get exhausted, really exhausted.

927
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,468
I was covered in sweat.

928
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:30,476
In his north-eastern dialect,
the old worker said something

929
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:35,212
I can't forget to this day: "No need to worry.

930
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:39,184
"lf you can't finish this morning,
you can go on in the afternoon.

931
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:41,254
"This basketful is for the two of you.

932
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:44,825
"lf you don't finish today,
there's always tomorrow."

933
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,790
That really got to me.

934
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:53,190
I was so bored.
The component parts bored me rigid.

935
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:56,360
I got through 100 of them
and there were many more.

936
01:27:56,504 --> 01:28:00,201
But he said that would be my job
from then on.

937
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,175
It was no fun anymore.

938
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:08,046
So I told him I was quitting.

939
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:11,282
I wanted to be a student again.

940
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:14,420
I said: "I'm a 16-year-old student.

941
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,453
"l don't want a uniform anymore."

942
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:20,720
My parents were against it,
jobs were scarce.

943
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:25,794
But I did quit. I left without my luggage.

944
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:35,408
Zhao Gang and his father

945
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:41,410
Long, long ago

946
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,810
I belonged to you

947
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,154
You belonged to me

948
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:55,224
Long, long ago

949
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,596
You left me

950
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:02,366
Flying high in the sky

951
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:09,475
The world outside is wonderful

952
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:56,276
Li Xuemei, 2003

953
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:58,910
Exam Registration Paper 10100010532

954
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:11,151
Arise!

955
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:14,813
Ye prisoners of starvation

956
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:16,220
Arise!

957
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:19,919
Ye toilers of the earth

958
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:24,988
For reason thunders new creation

959
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:30,368
'Tis a better world in birth...

960
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:39,099
Things we have thought and done

961
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:45,272
Must ramble and thin out

962
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,907
Like milk spilt upon a stone

963
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:50,382

Su Na

965
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:26,207
It's such a hassle.

966
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:33,145
The stuff you want is so expensive.
Who can afford it?

967
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:39,087
Who can afford to show off like you?

968
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:31,271
Su Na, born 1982 in Chengdu

01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:23,421
In grade 1, I was 1.66 meters tall.
A good figure.

971
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:27,490
So I thought I could be a model
or something like that.

972
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:29,965
But I didn't get any taller.

973
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:31,828
It was such a shame.

974
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:54,890
Most of us in school were not
good students.

975
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:57,023
And the teaching was pretty bad.

976
01:38:59,566 --> 01:39:03,058
He was manager of one
of the workshops in 420.

977
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:05,332
So he had good connections.

978
01:39:05,472 --> 01:39:08,805
He used his influence to get me transferred

979
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:11,242
to High School 4.

980
01:39:12,246 --> 01:39:15,704
He thought I'd go
to some famous university,

981
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:18,343
Iike Tsinghua or Peking University,

982
01:39:18,419 --> 01:39:21,047
to make him proud of me

983
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:23,982
and honor our ancestors.

984
01:39:24,591 --> 01:39:26,752
But I'm not the studying type.

985
01:39:26,894 --> 01:39:28,862
Not at all.

986
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:33,122
I failed the college entrance exam.

987
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:37,694
I had the strong feeling
that I'd let my parents down.

988
01:39:39,373 --> 01:39:42,365
For a while I hung around on the streets.

989
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,641
I had nothing to do.

990
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:47,008
I wasn't willing to work in 420.

991
01:39:48,582 --> 01:39:50,709
But things are going fine now.

992
01:39:50,851 --> 01:39:52,716
I work as a shopper.

993
01:39:52,886 --> 01:39:56,549
I go to Hong Kong every two weeks
to buy things for my clients.

994
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:00,591
There are many rich people here.

995
01:40:01,195 --> 01:40:04,596
So I can easily make money.

996
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:08,324
Rich women with time on their hands

997
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:10,996
Iike fashion but have no energy to buy.

998
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:13,130
So they hire me to buy for them.

999
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:16,267
All the famous brands.

1000
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:19,777
Shoes, scarves, belts,

1001
01:40:19,913 --> 01:40:22,381
watches, that kind of thing.

1002
01:40:22,883 --> 01:40:24,976
I get 1000 yuan per item.

1003
01:40:25,452 --> 01:40:28,148
Enough to live on.

1004
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:30,219
Pretty good, in fact.

1005
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:35,054
See that tower?

1006
01:40:35,896 --> 01:40:37,022
Yes.

1007
01:40:37,097 --> 01:40:39,463
We call it the Panda TV Tower.

1008
01:40:40,401 --> 01:40:42,369
I have a friend from Malaysia.

1009
01:40:42,669 --> 01:40:45,001
I met him on a plane.

1010
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:48,074
He wants to take over
the revolving restaurant

1011
01:40:48,475 --> 01:40:50,272
and hire me to manage it.

1012
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:54,144
I've never worked in catering,

1013
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:56,880
but there's no harm in trying.

1014
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:59,544
Maybe I'll become a powerful woman!

1015
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:00,985
What do you think?

1016
01:41:05,092 --> 01:41:08,425
I bought a car for my credibility.

1017
01:41:08,962 --> 01:41:12,056
I have to see those rich ladies every day.

1018
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:16,769
If I didn't have a car,
I'd feel quite embarrassed.

1019
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:19,566
I'll repay the loan myself.

1020
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:23,908
My classmates' parents
have put money aside for them

1021
01:41:23,977 --> 01:41:26,571
since they were little.

1022
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:30,913
I forget the name of the fund.
Anyhow, it's ring-fenced.

1023
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:33,315
And when they're old enough

1024
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,852
they'll own apartments and cars.

1025
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:43,926
My mother was laid off in 1995.

1026
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:48,492
While my father was working,
he kept his hands clean.

1027
01:41:48,635 --> 01:41:50,933
He never found my mother a well-paid job.

1028
01:41:51,972 --> 01:41:56,272
She found a part-time job
in a telegraph-pole factory.

1029
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:58,344
She's still doing that now.

1030
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:06,143
Since he retired
my dad's been permanently grumpy.

1031
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:12,117
He can't adjust to not being in charge.

1032
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:16,591
When he worked,
the house was packed with visitors.

1033
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:19,865
It was very lively.

1034
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,060
Now nobody at all comes to visit.

1035
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:26,730
In the first few months,

1036
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:31,205
he hardly stepped outside at all.

1037
01:42:32,346 --> 01:42:34,439
And he became very taciturn.

1038
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:38,546
When he got up in the morning,

1039
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,147
he'd just sit on the sofa,

1040
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:43,653
chain-smoking.

1041
01:42:48,362 --> 01:42:50,227
I didn't go home much.

1042
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,861
I didn't want to.

1043
01:42:55,602 --> 01:42:57,797
Whenever I was there,

1044
01:42:58,372 --> 01:43:01,705
I felt the mood of failure and depression.

1045
01:43:05,212 --> 01:43:07,908
I lived with my first boyfriend

1046
01:43:08,081 --> 01:43:11,278
in Royal Mansion, Yulin Gardens.

1047
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:14,019
It was a pretty nice place.

1048
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:17,416
But we eventually broke up.

1049
01:43:20,227 --> 01:43:21,785
Then I found another guy.

1050
01:43:21,962 --> 01:43:25,693
And we lived in a place called
"Beautiful Age".

1051
01:43:28,969 --> 01:43:31,233
I also lived in a one-room flat.

1052
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:34,499
I think that was with my third boyfriend.

1053
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:37,207
The bottom line is,
I didn't want to go home.

1054
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:40,007
Not if I could avoid it.

1055
01:43:43,917 --> 01:43:46,408
One day, to apply for a trip, I needed

1056
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:50,453
my permanent residence document.

1057
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:52,558
So I went home to get it

1058
01:43:53,126 --> 01:43:54,718
and found the door locked.

1059
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:59,297
I realized I didn't know where my key was.

1060
01:44:01,001 --> 01:44:03,333
I don't know what was wrong with me.

1061
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:07,566
So I went to see my mother at her factory.

1062
01:44:08,342 --> 01:44:10,833
I'd never been there before.

1063
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:16,180
As soon as I went inside,

1064
01:44:16,516 --> 01:44:19,679
I was deafened by the noise.

1065
01:44:19,853 --> 01:44:21,787
You had to shout to be heard.

1066
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:24,517
I looked around the place.

1067
01:44:26,293 --> 01:44:28,659
But I couldn't see my mother.

1068
01:44:30,163 --> 01:44:34,827
The workers were all wearing blue uniforms.

1069
01:44:36,236 --> 01:44:40,730
I had to go up to every person.

1070
01:44:42,075 --> 01:44:43,804
I was looking for my mother.

1071
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:51,249
Finally,

1072
01:44:52,586 --> 01:44:56,283
I found her over in a corner.

1073
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,686
She was carrying ingots of steel.

1074
01:45:00,027 --> 01:45:02,325
She took them and threw them,

1075
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:05,454
one after the other into some boxes.

1076
01:45:07,701 --> 01:45:12,434
Every time she threw one, it went bang!

1077
01:45:14,207 --> 01:45:17,643
I had never felt that sad in my whole life.

1078
01:45:17,944 --> 01:45:20,845
It was like a sharp pain

1079
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:24,606
striking my heart. It made all my limbs ache.

1080
01:45:27,387 --> 01:45:31,551
I didn't even know if it was a man
or a woman when I approached.

1081
01:45:32,726 --> 01:45:34,694
The head was bent down.

1082
01:45:37,798 --> 01:45:42,167
I started crying
when I saw it was her and I ran off.

1083
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:58,314
I had dinner at home that night.

1084
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:01,379
My parents were so surprised:

1085
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:04,149
"Why have you come home for dinner?"

1086
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:06,516
I didn't answer.

1087
01:46:08,462 --> 01:46:11,659
After eating, I told my mother

1088
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:14,630
that I would stay the night.

1089
01:46:15,102 --> 01:46:17,036
She was very happy.

1090
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:20,264
She made my bed and brought a quilt.

1091
01:46:21,675 --> 01:46:24,439
I hadn't touched that bed in ages.

1092
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:36,187
As I lay on it, I suddenly felt grown-up.

1093
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:41,393
I began to care about my parents.

1094
01:46:48,702 --> 01:46:52,399
The thing I most want now
is to make a lot of money.

1095
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:54,368
Lots and lots of money.

1096
01:46:54,508 --> 01:46:58,308
I want to buy an apartment
in 24 City for my parents.

1097
01:47:03,984 --> 01:47:06,612
I know it will cost a lot.

1098
01:47:07,187 --> 01:47:09,747
But I can do it.

1099
01:47:10,657 --> 01:47:12,955
I'm the daughter of a worker.

1100
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:30,103
Chengdu

1101
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:39,037
Home of the lotus-eating life

1102
01:48:42,816 --> 01:48:46,115
That's what makes my life worth living

1103
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:48,154
