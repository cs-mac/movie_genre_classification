MIKE: Why is it that
everything important

2
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,516
that happens to you
when you're a kid

3
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,184
happens during the summer?

4
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,854
In the summer of 1971,
I was 10 years old

5
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,591
and the only thing I looked
forward to more than
the last day of school

6
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,762
was the first day of practice
of hydroplane racing season.

7
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,165
You could say Madison kids
were born into racing

8
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,735
the same way some folks
are born in the oil business
or farming.

9
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,472
The town's port
on the Ohio River

10
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,542
at one point had been
the busiest in the Midwest,

11
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,877
but that had started
to change.

12
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,649
And though the river
had given the town
its prosperity,

13
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,285
boat racing had given it
her identity,

14
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:29,489
having hosted the first
professional boat race
in the United States.

15
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,991
The town even owned
its own boat.

16
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,328
They called it
the
Miss Madison.

17
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:40,166
In June of 1961,
my father climbed in
that very same boat,

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,335
just two days
after I was born,

19
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,404
and barely survived
a tragic accident,

20
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,439
which ended his racing career

21
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,842
and took the life
of his best friend.

22
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:55,248
People used to say I should
have known my father
before the accident,

23
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,217
that he was a different man.

24
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,419
Well, that summer,
10 years later,

25
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,922
he would give us
a glimpse of just
what kind of man he was.

Listen, honey.

172
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,075
There's somethin' I wanted
to talk to you about.

173
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,646
Walker and Helen
are movin' to Indianapolis.

174
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,916
He asked me to
take over as team manager.

175
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,319
It was completely unexpected.
You said yes?

176
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,321
I had to say yes.
How could you do that?

177
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,855
How can you say
it's unexpected, Jim?

178
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,657
Walker's been lookin'
for an excuse
to get out of here

179
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,527
for the last five years
and you know it.

180
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,829
If we had any sense at all,
Jim, we'd go, too.
No, no, no.

181
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,331
Let's not get started
on this.
Why, Jim?

182
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,799
We're getting in
deeper and deeper, you know?

183
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,368
How many people leave here
before you see
the writing on the wall?

184
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,204
And what wall is this?
A wall from our house?

185
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,107
How many homes do we own
up in Indianapolis
or Cincinnati?

186
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,608
How many jobs
do we hold up there?

187
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,912
How many jobs
did Owen have before
he went to Chicago, Jim?

188
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,814
Now, that's really
a fair comparison.

189
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,849
Jim, he invited you
to partner with him.

and head off to the sunshine
of Miami for the first race
of the season.

196

A little somethin'

All right, Jimmy,
I wanna talk to you
for a minute.

206
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,675
that we've borrowed from
her raspberry-filling fund,

207
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,176
she'll skin
both our heinies.

208
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,477
I'll keep that in mind.

209
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,746

of misguided Indians,

845

they were paddling
upstream from Kentucky

847

they were in Cincinnati.

used to sit down there

comin' in
