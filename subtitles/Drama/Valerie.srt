1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,870
VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS

2
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,304
Who's there?

3
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,315
Weasel!

4
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,993
Valerie, forgive me.

5
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,514
Where are her earrings?

6
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,045
Speak!

7
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,468
I lost them, Constable.

8
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,714
- You're lying, Eagle.
- No I'm not.

9
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,735
You can't get out of this.
I'll give you the water torture!

10
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,944
Eagle!

11
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,606
Bend down!

12
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,508
I will jump on your back.

13
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,668
Hurry up.

14
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,126
You brat.

15
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,830
<i>Goodnight, my dark haired girl</i>

16
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,854
<i>Goodnight, and sweet dreams</i>

17
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,694
Grandma, the actors have arrived.

18
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,371
You should be more concerned
that the missionaries are coming.

19
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,761
When?

20
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,074
Today or tomorrow.

21
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,575
One of them will be living with us.

22
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,452
Playing with your earrings, child?

23
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,986
I'm not a child anymore, Grandma.

24
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,198
You see, last night...

25
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,609
At the age of thirteen...

26
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,165
Just like your mother.

27
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,389
I'm warning you...

28
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,237
Get rid of those earrings.

29
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,454
Your mother put them away
on the day she entered the convent.

30
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,318
Your father was a bishop.

31
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,571
As you know, both are now in heaven.

32
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,129
Is there some secret in these earrings?

33
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,281
Oh, no.

34
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,663
I got them at an auction, with this
house, from a certain Constable.

35
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,405
Did you know him?

36
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,821
Grandma, the actors have arrived!

37
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,490
That's just a wedding, dear.

38
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,655
Hedvika is getting married.

39
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,890
Have mercy on her, oh Lord!

40
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,551
Deliver her from thy wrath...

41
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,296
Poor Hedvika.

42
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,801
Why?

43
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,465
She'll be a rich farmer's wife now.

44
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,326
Grandma!

45
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,256
Grandma, a monster!

46
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,373
It can't be.

47
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,850
He's dead, after all.

48
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,511
Who are you talking about, Grandma?

49
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,968
Go and practice your piano scales.

50
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,891
Yes, Grandma.

51
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,633
<i>Beautiful maiden,</i>

52
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,835
<i>It was I who stole your earrings,</i>

53
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,662
<i>and who returned them
to your hands again.</i>

54
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,603
<i>My uncle, the Constable,
longs to possess them.</i>

55
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,342
<i>He killed my father and mother,
and now I fear for you.</i>

56
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,587
<i>In church today,</i>

57
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,084
<i>there will be a sermon for maidens.</i>

58
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,383
<i>Please leave a dress
of yours in the arbor,</i>

59
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,098
<i>so that I can talk to you in disguise.</i>

60
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,373
<i>Your unhappy Eagle</i>

61
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,754
Valerie?

62
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,760
Valerie?

63
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,325
Where are you my child?

64
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,314
Valerie?

65
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,234
Valerie?

66
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,456
It's time to dress for church.

67
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,820
Grandma, may I take
with me a sprig of rosemary?

68
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,714
I, God's servant, a missionary...

69
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,043
I've come before you, dear maidens,

70
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,263
to give you knowledge
and God's blessing.

71
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,373
Oh maiden, do you know what you are?

72
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,188
You are an alabaster handshake.

73
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,301
You are an uncut pomegranate.

74
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,921
You are a boat full of leaves,
and an unfurling rosebud.

75
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,702
The coarse hand that touches your breast

76
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,280
would leave an indelible fingerprint.

77
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,130
But I am here with you, dear maiden.

78
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,167
Like your guardian angel, I bow to you.

79
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,822
And I bless with this wine,

80
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,697
your lips, your breast,

81
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,673
your lap.

82
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,372
Amen.

83
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,603
Amen.

84
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,074
Eagle?

85
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,148
Eagle?

86
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,096
Eagle?

87
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,544
Eagle!

88
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,405
Eagle?

89
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,805
Valerie, is that you?

90
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,683
That monster tortured me.

91
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,980
Valerie, a few words of advice...

92
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,323
- We're in the town square.
- I'm sorry.

93
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,377
Don't look.

94
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,750
Now?

95
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,909
Now!

96
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,726
I'm here.

97
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,880
First of all...

98
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,206
Where is the public
poorhouse, dear child?

99
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,542
There, Father.

100
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,542
You have acted out of mercy.

101
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,381
Or do you not like me?

102
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,306
It's not that, Father.

103
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,327
Bless me, please.

104
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,423
You enter first.

105
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,904
Go on, don't worry.

106
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,041
Please.

107
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,529
This is my kingdom.

108
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,121
Valerie?

109
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,669
Come...

110
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,572
Closer...

111
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,248
Look... come closer.

112
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,121
Look.

113
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,118
Oh no!

114
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,820
I know that I don't
appeal to you anymore, my Gracián.

115
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,120
Only five years ago,
when you were last here...

116
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,516
...but now!

117
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,446
Go away!

118
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,880
I will lash myself!

119
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,210
Grandma!

120
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,277
Watch!

121
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,462
It's only a dream.

122
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,730
I'm asleep and everything is a dream.

123
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,657
Did he hurt you?

124
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,344
No.

125
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,626
He wants you to love him.

126
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,602
How can I love him when
I'm afraid of him?

127
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,669
That's exactly why.

128
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,184
Eagle?

129
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,875
Eagle!

130
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,753
I'm expecting you, Constable.

131
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,985
Damned meddler.

132
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,753
Hands up, burglar, or I'll shoot!

133
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,927
Elsa, it's me.

134
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,151
Don't you remember me?

135
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,369
Richard...

136
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,542
How long since
anybody called me by that name.

137
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,462
Why did you come, Richard?

138
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,559
I missed you so much.

139
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,407
I have never loved another man...

140
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,654
Since the day you seduced me and left.

141
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,763
I'm really sorry about that.

142
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,831
Look at how old you are, Elsa!

143
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,861
You were seventeen then.

144
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,833
I'd give anything
to be young again like you!

145
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,227
Richard, tell me your secret.

146
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,642
I'll give you everything you want.

147
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,630
Give me back this house, Elsa!

148
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,351
Then I'd be robbing Valerie.

149
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,749
You are capable of
deeds much worse than that.

150
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,199
Yes, I'll do it.

151
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,441
Very well, let's make a contract.

152
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,429
You will be young and beautiful again.

153
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,383
It will happen tonight,
at that miserly farmer's wedding.

154
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,788
You're a devil!

155
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,169
This pearl will save you.

156
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,471
Eagle, where is Valerie?

157
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,643
- I kidnapped her.
- Where?

158
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,393
To the church tower.

159
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,502
Come here, fool!
You will take me there too!

160
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,646
Let us pray.

161
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,617
Hear that?

162
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,745
Three times the bells have tolled,
then gone silent again.

163
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,723
This is excellent.

164
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,302
One enjoys any meal after hardships.

165
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,713
Especially after the things
I saw when I was among the cannibals.

166
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,898
We saved a young black girl.

167
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,016
She was very beautiful.

168
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,247
What happened to her, Father?

169
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,106
We took her to our tent,
and turned her to our faith.

170
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,437
She showed a great talent.

171
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,139
And did she really become a nun?

172
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,508
Unfortunately not.

173
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,074
- We lost her in a certain French port.
- Martha, where's the wine?

174
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,224
One day I'll tell you
what happened to her.

175
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,403
She fell into immoral ways,

176
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,519
and sinned against the
sixth commandment.

177
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,673
I must give you
a talk on the subject, dear child.

178
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,330
Thank you, Father.

179
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,013
Your father, the Bishop,
was a sensitive man.

180
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,576
He fainted when prostitutes confessed.

181
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,101
All the beautiful women adored him.

182
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,620
I will tell you more sometime.

183
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,112
And how many children did he have?

184
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,139
You, and a boy named Eagle.

185
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,241
Eagle?

186
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,824
What is it?

187
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,170
I've got a headache.
May I go and lie down?

188
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,091
Dinner isn't over yet.

189
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,606
Sorry.

190
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,422
Will you toast with us?

191
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,656
I've never had wine before.

192
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,290
Make an exception today.

193
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,968
In memory of the late Bishop.

194
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,201
Eagle!

195
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,549
Eagle!

196
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,250
I want to talk to you, dear child.

197
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,147
Now, Father?

198
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,211
There is no better time
for contemplation.

199
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,694
What beautiful breasts you have.

200
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,620
Please go away, Father!

201
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,124
I want something sweet from you.

202
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,665
You're beautiful!

203
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,886
- You're so lovely!
- Go away!

204
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,952
You're magnificent!

205
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,744
I will resist you, you coward!
You'll be responsible for my death!

206
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,517
What have you done?

207
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,140
The fowl plague is here!

208
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,897
It is done.

209
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,544
My house is yours again.

210
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,265
And now we will wait until midnight.

211
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,838
In the bridal chamber.

212
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,620
Come, come, it is time.

213
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,974
The end of all my dreams.

214
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,264
Come, it's time.

215
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,780
I'm so old.

216
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,227
I will be too.

217
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,452
- Do you love me?
- I do.

218
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,237
Not one drop of blood.

219
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,949
Don't cry.

220
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,029
You look old when you cry.

221
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,568
Valerie!

222
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,434
Valerie!

223
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,857
Eagle!

224
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,686
Eagle...

225
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,218
Valerie!

226
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,852
Please.

227
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,540
- Don't look at me like that.
- What way?

228
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,046
Kneel down!

229
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,262
Kneel down!

230
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,284
- Is it too cold?
- No.

231
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,645
I'm like a blind man.

232
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,966
There is an empty guest
room at our house.

233
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,307
You can relax there.

234
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,876
He threw me down from the tower.

235
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,688
The bell saved my life.

236
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,836
I heard the strange toll.

237
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,636
I prayed for you.

238
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,808
The fowl plague is our best friend.

239
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,123
If my uncle, the Constable,
doesn't get enough fresh blood,

240
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,266
- He will die a terrible death.
- You're cruel.

241
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,082
He's a hundred years overdue for death.

242
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,720
The monster.

243
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,810
It's nothing, only a man hanging.

244
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,857
Where are we?

245
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,952
Still under your house.

246
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,503
I'm afraid.

247
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,439
Be brave.

248
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,096
Who is in these coffins?

249
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,974
Weasel's victims.
He sucked their blood. Look here.

250
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,655
Grandma!

251
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,417
Valerie!

252
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,595
Excuse me, I wasn't suitably dressed.

253
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,268
This is your room.

254
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,830
I thought that the room was empty.

255
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,796
I came on the midnight coach.

256
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,564
Don't you recognize me?

257
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,373
I'm your second cousin.

258
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,210
Call me Elsa.

259
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,486
Valerie.

260
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,157
And this is... This is my brother.

261
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,212
Eagle.

262
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,449
I have taken your room, it seems.

263
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,657
You may have it.

264
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,278
No, no, you can give me another one.

265
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,323
I'll talk to Grandmother about it.

266
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,804
Your grandmother has
gone away, dear child.

267
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,427
Without saying goodbye?

268
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,566
Old people have strange habits.

269
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,138
I hope you will allow
me to take her room.

270
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,411
With pleasure.

271
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,787
This room is yours.

272
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,789
Please.

273
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,431
I'd love to ride a horse.

274
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,022
I'll lend you mine.

275
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,007
I'm very tired, I must go to bed.

276
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,070
- You really don't recognize me?
- No.

277
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,471
Are you afraid of me?

278
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,023
I'm just joking, my dear.

279
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,556
After all, we've never met before.

280
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,399
My earrings!

281
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,166
Your sister hasn't returned yet?

282
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,763
Where is Valerie? Do you know?

283
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,153
You're handsome when you're angry.

284
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,948
Where is Valerie?

285
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,999
I will tell you on one condition...

286
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,517
You must make love to me.

287
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,988
Never!

288
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,234
Leave this room.

289
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,023
No.

290
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm not your guest. You go!

291
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,644
You will regret this.

292
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,503
You will have a glorious death!

293
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,943
Die, maiden! Die!

294
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,523
Eagle! Eagle! Eagle!

295
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,207
<i>Goodnight, my dark haired girl</i>

296
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,279
<i>Goodnight, and sweet dreams</i>

297
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,773
<i>When you awake, my love</i>

298
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,227
<i>Don't reveal your secret</i>

299
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,375
Valerie, you are saved.

300
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,697
I heard everything.

301
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,900
My cousin is in love with you.

302
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,714
Your cousin?

303
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,240
I know. She's really Grandma.

304
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,021
She stole my earrings.

305
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,217
But they were empty.

306
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,403
Here is their secret...

307
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,368
They will protect you
from danger and death.

308
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,354
Beware of Weasel.

309
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,824
Where is he?

310
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,640
He's dying.

311
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,458
Wretch.

312
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,381
He has bewitched you.

313
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,829
Valerie...

314
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,931
I love you.

315
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,938
You can't!

316
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,872
- We are brother and sister.
- But...

317
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,224
- We have the same father.
- That's not true!

318
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,198
Valerie, come back!

319
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,123
Valerie, my father is Weasel!

320
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,916
I will, I won't...

321
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,664
I will, I won't...

322
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,166
I will!

323
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,424
I'm dying!

324
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,396
I'm dying!

325
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,469
Now you know what old age is like.

326
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,201
Valerie? Valerie?

327
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,948
You're wasting your breath.

328
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,057
Valerie's dying.

329
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,039
I sacrificed her for my youth.

330
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,136
You are as lost as I am.

331
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,962
You will fall into the same agony.

332
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,741
Only your granddaughter
could have saved us both.

333
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,116
She has my blood.

334
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,611
How is that?
Her father was the Bishop.

335
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,178
I was the Bishop!

336
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,968
I'm Valerie's father!

337
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,458
You lie.

338
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,309
A drink...

339
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,479
- A drink...
- No!

340
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,731
First tell me how to prolong my youth.

341
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,780
Save Valerie!

342
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,747
Our salvation lies in her blood.

343
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,622
Valerie.

344
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,017
Cursed Valerie.

345
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,578
It's me.

346
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,308
Father!

347
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,553
My child!

348
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,834
Take this.

349
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,836
No, I'm squeamish!

350
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,103
I'm only human again, and I must die.

351
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,625
No, you won't die.

352
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,718
You have saved me.

353
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,737
Father!

354
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,247
- Let me go! Please!
- I'm the monster again!

355
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,263
Let me go!

356
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,684
Leave me alone!

357
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,146
No! No! No!

358
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,204
Gracián!

359
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,816
My Gracián!

360
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,588
Gracián!

361
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,456
Your lover sleeps like a log.

362
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,702
Gracián.

363
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,648
Poor Gracián.

364
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,110
I have a certain plan, Elsa.

365
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,986
I need Eagle's heart.

366
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,272
You want to kill Eagle?

367
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,683
His heart will reanimate my daughter
and give her eternal youth.

368
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,595
Richard, place Eagle's heart
into my chest.

369
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,910
You are betraying Valerie.

370
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,567
Richard, you will do it.

371
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,088
With a bleeding heart.

372
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,086
Eagle?

373
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,561
Eagle?

374
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,444
Why did I leave you?

375
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,618
Help!

376
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,926
Help!

377
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,945
Why are you haunting me, Valerie?

378
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,323
Don't worry, I'm not dead.
Neither are you.

379
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,569
Come on, I'll show you the way out.

380
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,351
The rectory is on the
other side, Father.

381
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,262
Sinner, you tempted me to sin!

382
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,585
You will see!

383
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,938
<i>Valerie,</i>

384
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,835
<i>Valerie,</i>

385
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,599
<i>This is goodbye.</i>

386
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,269
<i>You have left me,
and the monster has disgraced your lips.</i>

387
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,515
<i>We could have been so happy together...</i>

388
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,045
<i>Believe me Valerie,</i>

389
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,632
<i>Weasel is neither your father nor mine.</i>

390
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,041
<i>You have prolonged his life.</i>

391
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,692
<i>I wanted be your protector,
friend, and husband, but it's too late.</i>

392
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,085
<i>Farewell Valerie,
Your Eagle.</i>

393
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,275
Valerie?

394
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,153
Valerie, what happened to you?

395
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,487
Come.

396
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,732
Hedvika.

397
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,189
Hedvika?

398
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,062
Hedvika, what happend to you? Hedvika?

399
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,055
I've wasted away since my wedding.

400
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,003
- You should eat hearty soups.
- No.

401
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,781
No. No. No.

402
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,403
I'm under the spell of a vampire.

403
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,098
Valerie?

404
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,524
Look at my shoulder.

405
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,629
Does it hurt?

406
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,803
Oh no. No.

407
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,786
Do you see anything on my lips?

408
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,383
- No, why?
- Aren't they stained?

409
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,751
You've been eating berries.

410
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,907
I'm not afraid of anything
when you're with me.

411
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,182
I'm so happy.

412
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,820
I've never had a close friend.

413
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,343
Valerie?

414
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,192
Valerie, I'm saved!

415
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,197
- Hedvika.
- See?

416
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,844
The mark is gone.

417
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,790
Your kisses have restored my health.

418
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,171
You're so beautiful.

419
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,002
A witch lives among you!

420
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,812
She tortured me with sinful words.

421
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,569
She rubbed her fawning hips against me.

422
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:22,012
When she found
that I could resist her seduction,

423
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,481
she threw a noose around my neck.

424
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,493
I thank God that I escaped with my life.

425
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,115
But the witch is hidden among you!

426
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,368
In the name of God, hand her over!

427
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,990
- She should be be burned to death!
- That's a lie! Don't believe him!

428
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,499
It's her! The witch!

429
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,188
Don't believe him! I swear he's lying.

430
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,976
Begone, Satan!

431
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,731
Seize her! To the stake with her!

432
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,452
Confess! You are a witch!

433
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,999
Liar, liar.

434
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,833
Atone for your sins!

435
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,740
Moustachioed comedian!

436
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,860
Eagle, why hast thou forsaken me?

437
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,995
Here she is, she's beautiful...

438
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,035
Our masters, back from their travels,

439
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,270
will give us their hands, their feet,

440
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,658
they'll rest their heads,

441
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,995
and we will kiss them.

442
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,387
Come here, you whore!

443
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,154
Do you want a beating?

444
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,298
Beast!

445
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,187
Drink deeply, Richard.

446
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,280
Disappeared!

447
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,129
Weasel!

448
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,074
I wish for all this magic to end.

449
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,850
<i>Goodnight, my dark haired girl</i>

450
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,892
<i>Goodnight, and sweet dreams</i>

451
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,443
<i>When you awake, my love</i>

452
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,965
<i>Don't reveal your secret</i>

453
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,566
Grandma?

454
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,840
You're back again?

455
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,135
Where would I have gone?
I was in church, my child.

456
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,511
Have the missionaries gone yet?

457
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,198
What missionaries?

458
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,284
What's wrong, my child?

459
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,365
Nothing, Grandma.

460
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,812
Grandma?

461
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,124
There's a strange boy.

462
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,984
It's only one of the
actors who have come to town.

463
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,254
<i>My dearest,</i>

464
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,854
<i>Do not go to the theater.</i>

465
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,467
<i>Instead,</i>

466
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,382
<i>as soon as possible,</i>

467
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,081
<i>harness horses, and drive
your carriage to the blue lake.</i>

468
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,043
Don't shoot for God's sake!

469
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,920
No!

470
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,434
Miss!

471
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,581
Miss, your grandmother is dying!

472
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,429
Grandma!

473
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,048
Dearest Grandma, how do you feel?

474
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,617
Grandma.

475
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,840
Grandma.

476
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,183
My mirror.

477
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,967
A driverless carriage
has left the courtyard.

478
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,912
That is a good sign.

479
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,689
I never had the
courage to tell you the truth.

480
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,687
Your mother loved a certain
young hunter.

481
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,511
And gave birth to his two children.

482
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,715
A boy and a girl.

483
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,312
But Richard, my lover,
insisted that the children were his.

484
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,253
And I, from jealousy,

485
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,653
drove your mother out of this house.

486
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,831
I kept the girl.

487
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,686
That's you.

488
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,148
But Eagle was
stolen away to an unknown place.

489
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,395
I drove out your mother
with these words:

490
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,301
"I will only take you in... "

491
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,777
"when the horses
bring you back on their own. "

492
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,838
My mother is still alive?

493
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,050
Grandma!

494
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,366
Mother!

495
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,199
My child!

496
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,414
This is your father, my dear.

497
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,096
I know your face from
somewhere, Father.

498
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,908
You probably remember
it from childhood.

499
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,436
Isn't this only a dream?

500
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,421
If only your grandmother
had forgiven me...

501
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,085
<i>Goodnight, my dark haired girl</i>

502
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,798
<i>Don't reveal your secret</i>

503
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:18,071
<i>Your secret</i>

504
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,392
<i>Your secret</i>

505
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:25,224
<i>Goodnight, my dark haired girl</i>

506
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,451
<i>Goodnight, and sweet dreams</i>

507
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,868
<i>When you awake, my love</i>

508
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,795
<i>Don't reveal your secret</i>

509
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,065
<i>Your secret</i>
