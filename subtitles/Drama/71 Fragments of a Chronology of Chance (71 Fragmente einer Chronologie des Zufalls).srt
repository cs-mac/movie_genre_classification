a 19-year-old student,
shot three people in a Viennese bank

3
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:11,096

with a shot in the head

4

<i>More than 100,000 people

10
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:38,331
<i>Peace efforts in Somalia
have suffered a setback.</i>

11
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:40,542
<i>The leaders of the two rebel groups,</i>

12
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,670
<i>Aideed and Ali Mahti,
have rejected the peace conference</i>

13
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:48,216
<i>in Addis Ababa

<i>For the first time since
the truce was agreed</i>

15

<i>Aideed's supporters have again attacked
UN positions in Mogadishu.</i>

US forces attempt to bring home</i>

17

<i>President Clinton's confused policy
to the Somali population.</i>

<i>Aircraft thundering overhead, bombs,</i>

19

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,947
<i>And psychological warfare:</i>

<i>Americans and Somalis shaking hands
in a gesture of peace.</i>

22
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,078
<i>On the reverse it says:</i>

23
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:20,457
<i>The only obstacle to peace
is rebel leader Aideed.</i>

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,167
<i>The Somalis find this</i>

25
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,170
<i>difficult to believe in view
of the heavily-armed US soldiers,</i>

<i>Ali Mahti, Aideed's rival,</i>

28
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:33,011

a clear statement of policy from Clinton</i>

29
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:37,515
<i>If he doesn't disarm the clans, Somalia
will sink back into anarchy and chaos,</i>

30
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:38,933

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,189
<i>However, the Americans are determined
to withdraw from the country in 6 months.</i>

32

<i>The Caribbean state of Haiti is becoming
a new crisis point for the UN.</i>

36
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,204
<i>But, as in Somalia,</i>

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,166
<i>resistance is growing
to the American and Canadian soldiers,</i>

38

Ralf Hoogestraat sends us this report:</i>

71 FRAGMENTS
OF A CHRONOLOGY OF CHANCE

102.8°

47
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,190
And by direct manipulation.
- What does that mean?

48
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,901
With the mouse instead of commands.

49
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,696
How long've you got for it?

50
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,823
End of term.

51
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,910
Talking of time,

52
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,163
your minute was up ages ago.

53
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,960
Ok, show me then.

54
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,671
Not so simple, is it?

55
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,974
So, that'll be 20 schillings, mate.
- Ok, ok.

56
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,977
Betting debts are debts of honour.

57
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,398
Which one is she, then?

58
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,984
The one in the green jersey, isn't she?

59
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,861
Shall we go in?

60
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,279
Yes, of course.

61
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,993
This is Mr. and Mrs. Brunner.

62
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:48,162
They'd like to meet Anni.

63
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,291
Anni, are you coming?

64
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,716
Hi there, Anni.

65
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,429
Hallo, Anni.
Look, we've brought you something.

66
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:06,597
Here …

67
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,851
Look, Anni …

68
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:13,896
Don't you like it?

69
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,318
Can I have it?
- No, Petra, the lady brought it …

70
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,575
You'll have to be patient.

71
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,453
It's a completely normal reaction.

72
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,248
Are you my new foster mummy?

73

'Morning.

Mrs. Thomek, countersignature, please.

Yes, go ahead.

Excuse me.

Good-bye. Thank you.

Pardon?
- Pardon what?

90
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,776
I'm sorry, I didn't catch what you said.

91
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:10,239
You don't need to say sorry.
I said: Thanks for asking. Fine.

00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,908
Thirty-five.
- Shut your face, OK?

160
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:12,765
… and sixty!

161
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,488
And how much time
d'you need to do it now?

162
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:31,451
Sorry.

163
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,070
I no understand. What you wanting?

164
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:44,857
<i>… saw them running away.
The attack is an act of revenge</i>

165
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,485
<i>by the radical Ulster Volunteer Force</i>

166
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,404
<i>for the IRA bomb attack</i>

167
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,615
<i>which killed 10 Protestants on Sunday …</i>

168
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,954
<i>according to a statement made
by the UVF to a local radio station.</i>

169
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,790
<i>This morning,
just a few hours before the shooting,</i>

170
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:02,709
<i>a 70-year-old Catholic was killed</i>

171
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,712
<i>by the Ulster Volunteer Force.</i>

172
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:10,133
<i>The trial of strength between
the French government</i>

173
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,385
<i>and Air France employees continues.</i>

174
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:17,390
<i>The strike by ground personnel
has now been joined by the pilots.</i>

175
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,852
<i>Yet again,
several thousand Air France employees</i>

176
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,979
<i>demonstrated at the airport in Paris,</i>

177
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:26,190
<i>joined this time by their colleagues
of Air Inter.</i>

178
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:29,277
<i>As a result,
half the flights were cancelled.</i>

179
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:31,988
<i>Only foreign airlines
flew into Paris today.</i>

180
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,575
<i>The striking employees are demanding
a written guarantee</i>

181
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:38,369
<i>that the programme of economy
measures will be withdrawn.</i>

182
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:42,999
<i>The government had originally planned
to rationalize several thousand jobs</i>

183
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:46,461
<i>but then capitulated
in the face of the strike.</i>

184
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:52,717
<i>The guerilla war being waged
by the Kurdish Workers' Party PKK</i>

185
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:55,470
<i>is claiming more and more
victims on both sides.</i>

186
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:58,389
<i>In the past two days,
42 civilians have been killed</i>

187
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:01,768
<i>in PKK attacks, among them children.</i>

188
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:07,190
<i>In a massacre in eastern Anatolia
alone 38 young men lost their lives.</i>

189
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,735
<i>Screams of pain, full of impotent rage.</i>

190
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:13,946
<i>This man is trying to retrieve
his dead brother's shoe</i>

191
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:17,533
<i>from the bloodstained floor
of the village café.</i>

192
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,828
<i>The police are dragging him away
from the scene of the bloodbath.</i>

193
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:26,042
<i>In Javi, near the town of Cat,
5 PKK guerillas disguised as soldiers</i>

194
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,754
<i>stormed into the bar and opened fire.</i>

195
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,965
<i>The victims are aged between 15 and 25.</i>

196
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:37,428
<i>A further 10 men were injured,
some of them critically.</i>

197
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,306
<i>This young woman
has lost her husband in a struggle</i>

198
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,308
<i>which he, like the other victims …</i>

199
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:36,863
Dear God, give the little one a long
life and good health

200
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:40,157
and give me a long life and good health

201
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,493
and help Maria to be a happier person

202
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,414
and help me to be a better
and happier person

203
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:50,668
and don't let me have any
serious illnesses

204
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,880
and don't let there be a third world war
or a nuclear disaster

205
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:55,673
not in this generation or the next.

206
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,967
And help all suffering people
in the world

207
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:01,012
and I thank thee for everything,
dear God. Amen.

208
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:18,446
When'll you be back?
- After six.

209
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,520
Punctual as clockwork! Hello, Anni.

210
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:15,813
Good afternoon.

211
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,817
Come in, don't be shy.
- Hello there, Anni.

212
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:21,068
Hello.

213
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:22,695
Do come on in.

214
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:25,448
Put your things there.

215
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:30,036
Did you find it all right?
- Oh, yes. No problem.

216
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:31,787
Can I take your jacket?

217
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,874
Your colleague from the Youth Office
had problems finding it.

218
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,584
Do you like it?

219
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:40,504
I'm so pleased you wore it today.

220
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:45,968
Come on, Anni. Take your jacket off
or you'll be too hot.

221
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,311
That's nice of you. Thank you.

222
00:39:57,605 --> 00:39:59,607
I promise I'll give it back
to you afterwards.

223
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,817
So, do come on in.

224
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,861
It's this way.

225
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:29,553
Do have a seat.

226
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,306
I hope you like the cake.

227
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:35,267
Do sit down.
- Thanks.

228
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:36,977
Are you coming to me?

229
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,817
Come here, Anni. Sit down here.

230
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,280
What is it?

231
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:53,452
What did you say? I didn't understand.

232
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,706
She wants to see her room.

233
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,208
I'm sorry?

234
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:03,045
She'd like to see the room
you'll be giving her.

235
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:07,007
Oh … of course.

236
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,301
But it's not quite ready yet.

237
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,692
Here you are, young lady!

238
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:30,197
Well, d'you like it?

239
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:39,373
You wouldn't have these problems
if you kept to the diet.

240
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,710
But I don't like it.

241
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:45,045
What do you suggest, then?

242
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:48,007
D'you prefer the pain?

243
00:43:58,053 --> 00:43:59,596
Get back!

244
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:04,143
Get back from the edge of the platform!

245
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:02,618
If you bet that He exists,
you win everything.

246
00:45:02,785 --> 00:45:04,870
If He doesn't exist,
you don't lose anything.

247
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:08,540
The other one says:
But why do I have to bet anything?

248
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:11,960
The first one says: You have no choice.
You're in the boat.

249
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:14,505
That's just an assertion.
If I don't want to, I don't have to.

250
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:20,010
Why? If you say you're not betting,
you're saying He doesn't exist.

251
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:24,390
You can't say it's not a political act
not to vote …

252
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:28,352
Great … now I don't need
to lug this around all the time.

253
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,230
You'll get the money tomorrow.

254
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,990
And why did you muck that one up?
- I was …

255
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:25,159
You weren't paying attention, were you?

256
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,910
So, just look at that.

257
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,580
Look, you're standing right,

258
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:32,958
your weight's right,
your feet are right.

259
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:35,752
Look, your basic position's OK.
Now just look at this!

260
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,881
Look where you're standing,
much too near the table!

261
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:41,425
And your feet are pointing
in the wrong direction!

262
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:44,178
Why don't you move back from the table?

263
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:47,890
And now it's too late.
And where's the ball? Much too far back.

264
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,975
And your balance? Up shit creek!

265
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:53,896
You can't go for the ball
when it gets you so far back.

266
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:57,232
Just look at the way you're twisting.
The energy's going to the left

267
00:46:57,399 --> 00:46:58,358
- all wrong.

268
00:46:58,525 --> 00:46:59,067
I was …

269
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:02,362
You were half asleep!
Stop making excuses!

270
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:05,866
Just slamming the ball isn't enough.
Open your eyes and look at your opponent.

271
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:07,910
You're not playing by yourself.

272
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,786
And what's that?
Don't bother getting annoyed.

273
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:12,122
Stop annoying me and concentrate,
will you?

274
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:13,123
But he kept …

275
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,168
And stop making excuses for yourself!
- I'm not making excuses!

276
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:18,212
You never stop making excuses!

277
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,964
You were too far forward,
the rest's irrelevant!

278
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:23,717
You have to follow the ball;
it won't follow you.

279
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:28,055
I know, I know …

280
00:47:29,223 --> 00:47:30,849
Well, if that's what you think …

281
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:37,731
You don't need to tell me,
I know I'm a burden on you …

282
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:40,859
No, it doesn't matter.

283
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,322
You don't need to bother
pretending I'm not.

284
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:50,285
I expect you'd be a burden on me
if I were in your place …

285
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,871
All right, all right …

286
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:56,542
Why?

287
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:03,423
Oh, come off it …

288
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,593
that's just a waste
of telephone money …

289
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:12,432
No, I'm very busy …

290
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,436
Shall I tell you what I do all day?

291
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:19,106
Well, then …

292
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:21,525
yes …

293
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:24,236
so do I …

294
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,406
All right, then …

295
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:30,242
Hey! I nearly forgot …

296
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:34,204
what happened about
Gebhard's promotion?

297
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:38,000
Now that I really don't understand …

298
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:41,503
then how long will it take?

299
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:47,968
Perhaps he should …

300
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,265
Ok, ok, all right …

301
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:55,684
I know …

302
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:57,811
I won't say another word …

303
00:48:58,895 --> 00:48:59,938
yes …

304
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:04,818
just meaning well doesn't count,
does it?

305
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,740
Yes, the old idiot's resentful,
I know …

306
00:49:10,616 --> 00:49:13,243
otherwise nothing'd be right
with the world, would it?

307
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,497
Well, let him fall on his face then …

308
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,791
it's not my job …

309
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:23,962
ok, ok, I'm sorry …

310
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,298
but it's true …

311
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:29,343
yes, all right …

312
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:31,803
forget it!

313
00:49:34,431 --> 00:49:36,475
What am I meant to say?

314
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:39,394
If I don't say anything,
you think I'm not interested …

315
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:42,856
if I do say something
then it's interfering.

316
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:46,652
So what am I supposed to do …
I'm sorry for existing …

317
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,362
Sorry …

318
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:51,990
All right,

319
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,243
let's stop …

320
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:56,870
Hey!

321
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,748
I wanted to tell you,

322
00:50:00,374 --> 00:50:03,877
Mrs. Wawrik, you know,
the one next door with the dog,

323
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:05,837
she's moved out …

324
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:08,131
gone to live with her children,

325
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:12,094
'cos she couldn't manage any more,
cooking and cleaning,

326
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,554
and all that - you know.

327
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:18,016
And now the children
have got her with them,

328
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,559
'cos she …

329
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:23,355
she said if she had to go into a home

330
00:50:23,522 --> 00:50:25,315
she'd do away with herself.

331
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:31,655
I didn't believe a word of it,
but it worked …

332
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:35,575
No, that's all, really,

333
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:41,289
can't think of anything else …

334
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:45,961
Say hello to Gebhard and give Sissi
a kiss from me …

335
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,131
I'm longing to see her …

336
00:50:50,257 --> 00:50:53,552
you don't know what you've got in her.

337
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:58,932
Rubbish …

338
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,810
come on …

339
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:04,563
can't you take a joke?

340
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:07,315
I meant it nicely.

341
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,029
Yes, of course …

342
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,907
all right … kisses …

343
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:18,410
stupid expression …

344
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,954
I'll never get used to it …

345
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,666
"Kisses"

346
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:28,462
Used to get on my nerves
with your mother, too: "Kisses."

347
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,839
between grown-up people …

348
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:35,844
It probably doesn't matter …

349
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:40,390
What?

350
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:47,314
Well, it's my phone bill, isn't it?

351
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:54,070
What else am I supposed to talk about
if not myself?

352
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:56,281
It's the only thing

353
00:51:56,448 --> 00:51:59,284
a decent person can talk about.

354
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:01,119
What?

355
00:52:01,995 --> 00:52:04,456
If it's too much for you, then hang up.

356
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:07,042
But you'll only have a bad conscience.

357
00:52:08,752 --> 00:52:10,796
See how well I know you …

358
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:13,632
Just as if I'd made you …

359
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:17,469
Yeah, you're right …

360
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:20,263
when you're bored …

361
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:23,350
you talk a load of rubbish.

362
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:26,770
All right, then …

363
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,396
'night.

364
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:29,731
Hey!

365
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:32,943
Let me speak to Sissi again …

366
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:36,154
Ok.

367
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:37,823
'Bye.

368
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:46,039
Hi, sweetie-pie …

369
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:47,958
sleep well …

370
00:52:48,959 --> 00:52:50,919
sweet dreams …

371
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:53,839
No …

372
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:55,632
I don't know …

373
00:52:56,675 --> 00:52:58,969
what did you dream yesterday, then?

374
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:07,352
No! Fancy that …

375
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:09,855
Good!

376
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:12,649
And what did he do then?

377
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:18,488
I know,
that's just what I'd have done, too …

378
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:21,157
Listen,

379
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:24,578
tonight it'll be different …

380
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:26,121
when you …

381
00:53:27,956 --> 00:53:29,833
What did Mum say?

382
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:33,837
Let me speak to her again …

383
00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:37,549
Come on …

384
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:40,343
sometimes I ask myself, I really do …

385
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:44,014
What?

386
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:46,933
Oh, really?

387
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:52,022
You're a really spiteful person,
did you know that?

388
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:54,024
What does it do for you?

389
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:56,568
Are you trying to hurt me …

390
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:57,944
or …

391
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:02,699
My god … just calm down and listen …

392
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,452
stop interrupting and screeching at me.

393
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:09,748
Well hang up, then …

394
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:13,168
I told you to before, anyway.

395
00:54:15,587 --> 00:54:16,796
Oh, really?

396
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:20,467
That's just fine!

397
00:54:21,593 --> 00:54:23,303
You'll see what it's like …

398
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:29,559
What are you trying
to get your own back for anyway?

399
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,936
What?

400
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:33,229
What are you trying
to get your own back for?

401
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:36,483
You can't really be that nasty …

402
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:43,323
I'd like to see you in my situation …

403
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:46,076
Yes, that's right …

404
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:48,870
it's the same for everyone …

405
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:52,165
Exactly!

406
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,460
Just you wait!

407
00:54:58,421 --> 00:54:59,673
'Bye.

408
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:02,133
Let me speak to Sissi again …

409
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,677
Just for a second …

410
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,722
so your family life isn't
disturbed too much.

411
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:15,981
Sweetie-pie …

412
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:23,381
I love you.

413
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,391
What's the matter?

414
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:35,977
Are you drunk, or what?

415
00:56:36,144 --> 00:56:37,645
Yes, why?

416
00:56:39,022 --> 00:56:40,398
Not very …

417
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,402
I mean, what are you getting at?

418
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:48,782
You don't say "I love you" out
of the blue. And certainly not you.

419
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,534
So, what d'you want?

420
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:54,454
I thought it would be helpful.
- For what?

421
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,087
Old High German.

422
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:35,091
Yes … it's a bit strange,
more like a foreign language sometimes,

423
01:00:35,258 --> 01:00:37,760
but I can't say I don't enjoy it.

424
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,013
Before Christmas.

425
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:43,308
But I've heard it's not a very difficult
exam. It's relatively harmless.

426
01:00:43,516 --> 01:00:47,270
The only problem is that training
takes up so much time.

427
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:49,522
And how are things your end?

428
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:54,902
Have the Gauweilers finished converting
their house yet?

429
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,114
Really?
It'll be interesting to see it.

430
01:00:59,532 --> 01:01:00,742
And Dad?

431
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:04,704
Yes, me too. Say hello from me.

432
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:09,292
Nothing much else to tell you, really.
I'm fine.

433
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:12,211
"How are you - I'm fine!"

434
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:16,382
Ciao, Mum, I'll be in touch.

435
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,144
Come in!

436
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:33,107
What's the matter?

437
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:38,029
Well, come on - what's up?

438
01:01:38,196 --> 01:01:40,531
When can I start sleeping there?

439
01:04:10,932 --> 01:04:12,308
<i>… I bribed the driver.</i>

440
01:04:12,475 --> 01:04:14,060
<i>Where did you get the money from?</i>

441
01:04:17,647 --> 01:04:20,107
<i>I begged and stole sometimes.</i>

442
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:25,071
<i>He wanted a lot of money - $200.</i>

443
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:34,872
<i>And then he said he would only
take me as far as the Austrian border.</i>

444
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,333
<i>It was too risky for him
to take me across the border.</i>

445
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,003
<i>How long did it take you
to get the money together?</i>

446
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:46,509
<i>A few months. I had to eat, too.</i>

447
01:04:47,552 --> 01:04:48,761
<i>I'm not on the game.</i>

448
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:53,516
<i>You said you crossed the border
over two weeks ago.</i>

449
01:04:53,683 --> 01:04:58,145
<i>Why didn't you go to the police
or somebody else earlier?</i>

450
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,987
<i>The driver said if they caught me</i>

451
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:09,156
<i>and I couldn't speak German
they'd send me back straight away.</i>

452
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:11,951
<i>What did you live from, all that time?</i>

453
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:19,125
<i>People are very careless here.
It's very easy to steal.</i>

454
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:21,752
<i>Where did you sleep?</i>

455
01:05:24,005 --> 01:05:26,215
<i>In empty houses.
- Wasn't that cold?</i>

456
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:30,344
<i>Yes, it was sometimes.</i>

457
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:32,972
<i>I've got this jacket.</i>

458
01:05:35,558 --> 01:05:38,269
<i>It's been cold the last few days.</i>

459
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:40,855
<i>That's why I went to the police.</i>

460
01:05:41,439 --> 01:05:46,360
<i>Can you tell us how you got the idea
of running away to Austria?</i>

461
01:05:51,616 --> 01:05:55,077
<i>I heard that people are nice
to children here.</i>

462
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:58,080
<i>Who did you hear that from?</i>

463
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:01,542
<i>From a girlfriend of mine.</i>

464
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:04,128
<i>And where did she hear that?</i>

465
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:10,051
<i>She's on the game,
so she talks to a lot of people.</i>

466
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:11,594
<i>How old is she?</i>

467
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:16,307
<i>About the same age as me.</i>

468
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:20,519
<i>What was your life like in Bucharest?
Don't you have parents?</i>

469
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:23,230
<i>No.</i>

470
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:27,526
<i>I ran away from a home two years ago.</i>

471
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:33,199
<i>There was a group of us at the station
- older children, too.</i>

472
01:06:34,116 --> 01:06:35,993
<i>They were my family.</i>

473
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:42,124
<i>It was all right at first,
but then it got harder and harder.</i>

474
01:06:45,461 --> 01:06:49,006
<i>Two of my friends died.
I didn't want to stay after that.</i>

475
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:50,216
Isn't that incredible?

476
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:52,760
<i>What do you think
will happen to you now?</i>

477
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,929
He doesn't seem real.

478
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:57,390
He's like an adult.
<i>I want to stay here.</i>

479
01:06:57,556 --> 01:07:00,601
<i>And where would you like
to live in Austria?</i>

480
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,649
<i>I don't know exactly. But …</i>

481
01:07:06,816 --> 01:07:10,277
<i>they said I'd probably have
to go back anyway.</i>

482
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:16,867
<i>But even if they do send me back,
I'll be back here again in a few months.</i>

483
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:21,247
<i>Whether Marian Radu can stay in Austria</i>

484
01:07:21,414 --> 01:07:24,542
<i>depends on the discretionary powers
of the immigration authorities.</i>

485
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:27,086
<i>The legal situation is as follows:</i>

486
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:30,089
<i>Foreigners who enter Austria illegally</i>

487
01:07:30,256 --> 01:07:34,885
<i>and who could have sought asylum
in a so-called secure state</i>

488
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,804
<i>are not eligible for asylum here.</i>

489
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:40,182
<i>All of Austria's neighbouring states
are considered secure states.</i>

490
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:41,726
<i>In addition …</i>

491
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,753
Can't you sleep?

492
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:34,588
No.

493
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:40,302
Are you thinking about that boy?

494
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:43,097
Yes.

495
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:51,814
And the little girl.

496
01:09:57,653 --> 01:09:59,071
Me too.

497
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:04,243
Well?

498
01:10:07,288 --> 01:10:10,958
I don't know.
How can we explain it to her?

499
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:22,803
<i>… against the Gaza-Jericho accord.</i>

500
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:25,973
<i>They shouted
"Death to Israel and America."</i>

501
01:10:26,557 --> 01:10:30,060
<i>The supporters of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah organisation were also grieving</i>

502
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:34,398
<i>for one of their fighters
who was killed in an Israeli attack.</i>

503
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,860
<i>In a retaliatory strike,
the Israeli air force</i>

504
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:40,070
<i>yesterday bombarded Hezbollah positions.</i>

505
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:43,866
<i>Previously, Hezbollah fighters
had attacked barracks</i>

506
01:10:44,033 --> 01:10:47,536
<i>used by the Israeli-supported
South Lebanon Army.</i>

507
01:10:47,703 --> 01:10:51,999
<i>They attacked the army base
with machine guns and mortar fire.</i>

508
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:55,419
<i>Later, Hezbollah fighters …</i>

509
01:10:55,628 --> 01:10:58,380
<i>captured 12 soldiers
of the South Lebanon Army.</i>

510
01:10:59,298 --> 01:11:03,802
<i>Today in the Hague the judges were sworn
in on the UN war crimes tribunal</i>

511
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:05,971
<i>for former Yugoslavia.</i>

512
01:11:06,138 --> 01:11:10,684
<i>The list of alleged war criminals
includes Croats and Serbs,</i>

513
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:13,562
<i>among others the Bosnian
Serb leader Karadžić</i>

514
01:11:13,729 --> 01:11:16,148
<i>and Serbian president Milošević.</i>

515
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:19,985
<i>However, proceedings will be difficult
since the tribunal is dependent</i>

516
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:24,782
<i>on the accused being extradited
by the Serbian or Croatian authorities.</i>

517
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:26,533
<i>For two years now,</i>

518
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:30,079
<i>pictures of the atrocities
in ex- Yugoslavia have shocked the world.</i>

519
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:32,831
<i>The concept
of so-called ethnic cleansing,</i>

520
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:35,250
<i>now part of everyday language,</i>

521
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:38,629
<i>has revived horrifying images
from the Second World War.</i>

522
01:11:38,796 --> 01:11:42,049
<i>New massacres are reported
with horrifying regularity.</i>

523
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:45,511
<i>On both sides,
soldiers and self-appointed militias</i>

524
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:47,471
<i>kill at random.</i>

525
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:51,558
<i>Neither women,
children nor old people are spared.</i>

526
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:56,021
<i>Thousands vegetate in prisons
and concentration camps,</i>

527
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:57,523
<i>in constant fear of death.</i>

528
01:11:58,065 --> 01:12:01,527
<i>There seem to be no limits
to the cruelty in this war.</i>

529
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:06,365
<i>Mass rape is constantly used by Serbian
soldiers to break the resistance</i>

530
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:09,535
<i>and will of the enemy.</i>

531
01:12:09,702 --> 01:12:12,955
<i>The survivors of these atrocities
have hoped in vain until now</i>

532
01:12:13,122 --> 01:12:14,581
<i>that those guilty of these crimes …</i>

533
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,003
Click it on with the left-hand button.

534
01:12:19,211 --> 01:12:22,006
Rotate it with the right-hand button.
Exactly …

535
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:23,757
now stick it on.

536
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:26,760
It fits.
You can do the same with the rest.

537
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:28,470
That's really clever …

538
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:31,306
it looks really good, too.

539
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:33,851
No, that doesn't fit there …

540
01:12:34,143 --> 01:12:36,353
When they go together
they change colour.

541
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:37,938
That's right.

542
01:12:38,105 --> 01:12:39,648
Here, give us the mouse.

543
01:12:39,815 --> 01:12:42,484
So you set the number
of puzzle pieces here

544
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:45,070
and here you set the time limit,

545
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:49,033
and there you've got the different
symbols you can make.

546
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,659
Let me have a go again.

547
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:53,037
I think I've nearly got it.

548
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,581
It always gets easier near the end …

549
01:12:55,748 --> 01:12:57,875
Well, two minutes wasn't that difficult.

550
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:00,919
If you go over the time,
it falls apart again.

551
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,588
That's the last piece …

552
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:04,715
Finished …

553
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:07,342
Great.

554
01:13:09,053 --> 01:13:11,263
And what does your professor
say about it?

555
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:14,349
Are you going to market it, or …?
- No way …

556
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:16,727
it's just a child's game,

557
01:13:16,894 --> 01:13:19,521
there's masses of stuff
that's much more sophisticated.

558
01:13:20,147 --> 01:13:22,399
But next year …

559
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:25,819
the Massachusetts Institute
is lending us …

560
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:27,905
the Data Glove.

561
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:31,241
It's a sort of electronic glove -
you've probably seen it on TV.

562
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:32,659
You put it on

563
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:35,829
and then you can move around
in the computer in three dimensions.

564
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:38,040
Hey! D'you know Mikado?

565
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,418
From years ago.

566
01:13:51,929 --> 01:13:53,055
This is …

567
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:57,768
skill against chance.

568
01:14:00,604 --> 01:14:02,564
Soon the Data Glove'll be on the market.

569
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:04,525
There'll be a new software sector

570
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:07,027
and you have to start
programming for it now.

571
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:09,196
D'you know how to play?

572
01:14:09,988 --> 01:14:11,031
More or less.

573
01:14:12,032 --> 01:14:13,534
That's the Mikado …

574
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,036
when you get that,
you can use it to help you.

575
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:17,371
That's right.

576
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:19,248
Let's start.

577
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:21,208
Go ahead.

578
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,185
What are we playing for?
- Nothing.

579
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:42,396
Nothing's nothing.

580
01:14:47,109 --> 01:14:48,110
Well?

581
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:50,320
Haven't a clue.

582
01:14:52,865 --> 01:14:53,866
Come on!

583
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:56,702
What d'you mean, come on?
- What are we playing for?

584
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:59,037
Come off it.

585
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,461
It moved …

586
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,051
No, seriously!

587
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:16,722
OK, what d'you want to play for?

588
01:15:26,315 --> 01:15:27,649
Your revolver?

589
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:33,864
And what are you betting?

590
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:35,657
What d'you want, then?

591
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:42,623
Haven't a clue.

592
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:48,754
Here, your turn.

593
01:15:52,758 --> 01:15:53,926
Your watch?

594
01:15:58,222 --> 01:16:00,766
My parents gave me that
when I finished school.

595
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:04,144
We don't have to play for anything.
It was your idea.

596
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:08,815
It moved!

597
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:28,335
He looks even younger than on TV.

598
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,798
Does he know it's only for a while?
- Yes.

599
01:16:33,048 --> 01:16:35,968
He knows the legal situation.
Shall we go in?

600
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:37,636
Come on then.

601
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:14,589
<i>… a peaceful Christmas …</i>

602
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:17,092
<i>is what most people in Sarajevo
dream about.</i>

603
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:20,512
<i>Like seven-year-old Dalida
and her friend Boris.</i>

604
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:22,180
<i>While they decorate the Christmas tree,</i>

605
01:17:22,514 --> 01:17:25,517
<i>hundreds of grenades fall on the city.</i>

606
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:27,519
<i>People run,</i>

607
01:17:27,686 --> 01:17:30,272
<i>trying to dodge the snipers' bullets.</i>

608
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:34,318
<i>In Sarajevo nearly all
the black market stands are empty.</i>

609
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:37,154
<i>Only a few Christmas wreaths
are for sale.</i>

610
01:17:37,738 --> 01:17:40,657
<i>"But they're much too expensive",
says this young woman.</i>

611
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:44,202
<i>"We're just glad to have enough food
for a small Christmas dinner, at least."</i>

612
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:48,040
<i>But many people are desperate,
like this mother.</i>

613
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:51,084
<i>This afternoon she took
her baby to hospital.</i>

614
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:54,963
<i>Her little boy had been hit
in the leg by shell splinters.</i>

615
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:57,924
<i>Is Michael Jackson telling the truth,</i>

616
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:00,052
<i>or was he putting on an act?</i>

617
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:03,513
<i>That's what his fans are asking
after the superstar's appearance</i>

618
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,307
<i>on TV yesterday evening.</i>

619
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:08,935
<i>After weeks of silence while undergoing
withdrawal treatment,</i>

620
01:18:09,102 --> 01:18:12,314
<i>in a live TV broadcast
from his ranch in California</i>

621
01:18:12,481 --> 01:18:15,400
<i>he denied all charges of child abuse.</i>

622
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:17,402
<i>Ralf Hoogestraat reports:</i>

623
01:18:19,488 --> 01:18:21,948
<i>"Don't treat me like a criminal,</i>

624
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:24,576
<i>"I'm innocent."
says a tearful Michael Jackson,</i>

625
01:18:24,743 --> 01:18:27,245
<i>broadcasting from the privacy
of his Neverland ranch.</i>

626
01:18:27,454 --> 01:18:31,833
<i>Visibly moved, he described how police
had examined his genitals.</i>

627
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,837
<i>Supposedly, some of the descriptions
given by the boy allegedly abused …</i>

628
01:18:38,173 --> 01:18:43,261
<i>… call 0 45 92 99.</i>

629
01:18:45,389 --> 01:18:49,226
<i>The call costs 13.33 schillings
per minute during the day,</i>

630
01:18:49,393 --> 01:18:53,522
<i>and 8.67at night and on weekends.</i>

631
01:18:55,816 --> 01:18:57,150
I'm off.

632
01:18:57,984 --> 01:19:00,362
When'll you be back?
- After six.

633
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:14,251
It's nearly all melted here.
How about with you?

634
01:19:15,335 --> 01:19:17,712
No skiing, then.

635
01:19:18,839 --> 01:19:20,757
Oh, well, we'll have to see.

636
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:25,137
Hey, I'll have to get on. I've got to pick
something up for my trainer with his car.

637
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:27,848
It's too complicated …
I'll tell you this evening

638
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:30,350
I'll have to hurry, or I'll be too late.

639
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:33,103
What?

640
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:36,815
The timetable says it leaves at 13.30.

641
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:40,152
Yes, so it should arrive
between five and six.

642
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:44,114
Well,
then call the station to make sure.

643
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:49,911
Star.

644
01:19:51,246 --> 01:19:52,789
Christmas star.

645
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:56,793
Exactly. Like in the sky.

646
01:19:57,878 --> 01:19:59,421
D'you understand?

647
01:20:01,756 --> 01:20:04,050
At night - stars everywhere.

648
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:11,516
Human beings.

649
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:16,354
You - human being.

650
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:17,856
Me - human being.

651
01:20:18,315 --> 01:20:20,358
Those - human beings.

652
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:31,036
<i>… and strong winds in the mountains</i>

655
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:43,048
Vehicle 7 approaching.

656
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,115
<i>… costs 79 schillings,</i>

657
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:17,160
<i>and 86 schillings for mussels in broth.</i>

658
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:21,122
<i>This is served with a 'baguette',
French white bread.</i>

659
01:23:21,289 --> 01:23:25,043
<i>About 20 metres further west
I come upon a stand …</i>

660
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:27,962
<i>that has all the charm of a beach hut.</i>

661
01:23:28,213 --> 01:23:30,256
<i>You can see through the window …</i>

662
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:35,011
<i>and watch the Asiatic chef
arranging portions of sushi …</i>

663
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:38,765
<i>- that's raw fish as eaten in Japan.</i>

664
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:42,102
<i>A young man
is just coming out of the door …</i>

665
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:44,729
<i>and I'm going to ask him
what he's just had:</i>

666
01:23:44,896 --> 01:23:47,190
<i>… I had salmon sushi,</i>

667
01:23:47,357 --> 01:23:48,942
<i>they're great.</i>

668
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:51,027
<i>It's raw fish with rice</i>

669
01:23:51,194 --> 01:23:56,032
<i>and underneath there's a green paste
which is made of horse-radish, I think.</i>

670
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:59,953
<i>It's really good, fantastic.</i>

671
01:24:00,704 --> 01:24:02,122
<i>How much was it?</i>

672
01:24:02,288 --> 01:24:06,000
<i>I'm ashamed to admit it,
but I ate two large servings.</i>

673
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:08,670
<i>Normally you're full
after one large helping,</i>

674
01:24:09,504 --> 01:24:12,006
<i>it cost 290,</i>

675
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:18,763
<i>I mean two times 145,
that'll do me for the whole day.</i>

676
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:21,516
<i>Culinary excursions to foreign parts …</i>

677
01:24:21,683 --> 01:24:23,268
<i>aren't always so expensive,</i>

678
01:24:23,435 --> 01:24:27,147
<i>I was assured by a student
from the Technical University nearby.</i>

679
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:29,816
<i>He had a Korean soup,</i>

680
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:34,696
<i>then moved on to a Greek restaurant
where he had a spinach strudel …</i>

681
01:24:34,863 --> 01:24:39,826
<i>and for dessert he bought an Israeli
orange from a Turkish grocer's.</i>

682
01:24:39,993 --> 01:24:43,079
<i>42 schillings all in all.</i>

683
01:27:16,608 --> 01:27:19,819
Now we're going to the bank
to get the money for our holiday.

684
01:27:19,986 --> 01:27:20,737
Bank!

685
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:22,697
Exactly.

686
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:27,452
To get the money.

687
01:27:27,994 --> 01:27:28,995
Come on.

688
01:27:42,133 --> 01:27:43,718
God, it's crowded.

689
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:50,016
We'll have to queue here.

690
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:15,792
D'you take cheque cards?
I don't have enough cash.

691
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,628
There's a machine over the way.

692
01:28:19,629 --> 01:28:20,588
Where?

693
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:22,674
Use your eyes!

694
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:27,739
<i>Out of order</i>

695
01:30:06,277 --> 01:30:09,447
I've got the car outside.
I just need 300 schillings.

696
01:30:09,614 --> 01:30:11,324
Please join the queue.

697
01:30:11,491 --> 01:30:14,744
The machine's out of order!
I'm blocking the gas station.

698
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:16,788
What the hell …
- Get back!

699
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:19,707
Come on, let's get out.

700
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:22,335
That's outrageous!

701
01:30:25,213 --> 01:30:26,923
Can I help you?

702
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,425
I'm OK, thanks.

703
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:26,524
You wait here.
I'll be back in a minute, OK?

704
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:29,402
Don't go away. You sit there, OK?

705
01:31:29,777 --> 01:31:31,445
I'll be back straight away.

706

<i>The bodies of the three victims
are being taken away.</i>

712
01:35:51,831 --> 01:35:54,792
<i>Police experts are searching the bank.</i>

713
01:35:54,959 --> 01:35:58,462
<i>They are searching between the pools
of blood for a clue to a motive,</i>

714
01:35:58,629 --> 01:36:02,258
<i>not to the identity of the perpetrator;
he has already killed himself.</i>

715
01:36:02,425 --> 01:36:05,553
<i>After the bloodbath in the bank
he ran across the street,</i>

716
01:36:05,719 --> 01:36:08,305
<i>got into his car at this gas station</i>

717
01:36:08,472 --> 01:36:11,142
<i>and committed suicide
with a shot in the head.</i>

718
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:14,603
<i>The police have identified
the killer as Maximilian B.,</i>

719
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:17,064
<i>a nineteen-year-old student.</i>

720
01:36:17,356 --> 01:36:20,985
<i>The motive for this senseless murder
is still a complete mystery.</i>

721
01:36:21,152 --> 01:36:24,655
<i>However, it is clear
that he did not intend to rob the bank.</i>

722
01:36:24,822 --> 01:36:28,159
<i>The gas station attendant,
one of the last people to speak to him,</i>

723

<i>has no explanation.</i>

<i>No idea, I dunno.</i>

725
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:35,249
<i>It's absolutely crazy.</i>

<i>Vienna, the day before Christmas.</i>

727

<i>People stunned by an act of insanity.</i>

728

<i>In Brussels today the last attempt</i>

729

<i>to secure peace for Bosnia

<i>In central Bosnia,

<i>… a peaceful Christmas is what

<i>Like seven-year-old Dalida

<i>In Sarajevo nearly all

<i>Only a few Christmas wreaths

<i>But many people are desperate,</i>

745
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:45,778
<i>like this mother.</i>

746
01:37:45,945 --> 01:37:48,781
<i>This afternoon she took
her baby to hospital.</i>

747

<i>Her little boy had been hit

748

<i>Is Michael Jackson telling the truth,</i>
