I LOOK AT JACOB NOW...

1309
01:43:33,936 --> 01:43:36,939
AND I THINK ABOUT
HOW DIFFERENT OUR LIVES
MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

1310
01:43:36,939 --> 01:43:40,943
ALL OF US. AND THAT'S
THE SADDEST PART OF ALL.

1311
01:43:41,443 --> 01:43:43,445
[ Jacob ]
HEY, JUDE, LOOK!

1312
01:43:46,949 --> 01:43:49,451
[ Judith ]
BUT LATELY, SOMETIMES,

1313
01:43:49,451 --> 01:43:52,955
I CAN FEEL MYSELF STARTING
TO COME ALIVE AGAIN.

1314
01:43:52,955 --> 01:43:54,957
AND IT'S SCARY, KIND OF.

1315
01:43:55,457 --> 01:43:57,459
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S EVEN ALLOWED.

1316
01:43:59,461 --> 01:44:04,466
MAYBE YOU CAN'T EXPECT
TO KEEP HAPPINESS OUT
OF YOUR LIFE FOREVER,

1317
01:44:04,466 --> 01:44:07,469
ANY MORE THAN TROUBLE.

1318
01:44:07,469 --> 01:44:11,473
YOUR WHOLE LIFE CAN CHANGE
IN A SECOND,

1319
01:44:11,473 --> 01:44:13,976
AND YOU NEVER EVEN KNOW
WHEN IT'S COMING.
