00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,160
And now he closes the door.

8
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,060
Good morning.

9
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,660
Good morning, sir.

10
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,660
Sit down.

11
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,160
<i>The Lord is my shepherd,</i>

12
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,830
<i>I shall not be in want.</i>

13
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,290
<i>He makes me lie down in green pastures,</i>

14
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,630
<i>he leads me beside quiet waters.</i>

15
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:40,890
<i>he restores my soul.</i>

16
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:53,000
<i>He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</i>

17
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,400
"It is told in the Bible"

18
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,330
"that Peter and Jesus once had
a conversation with one another"

19
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
"and then Peter said to Jesus: ..."

20
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,060
<i>... dwell in the house of the LORD my whole life long.</i>

21
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,060
You in the first row please will you distribute these.

22
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,430
Don't forget to not give... I mean don't forget to give ...

23
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,180
- The denominations.
- Yes, don't forget to give the denominations.

24
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,060
And remember ... No whispering.

25
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,460
Anyone who whispers must hand over his test paper at once,
and he will fail.

26
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,860
If anyone has anything to ask, do it now!

27
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,200
OK, you can begin.

28
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,080
Do we have to give the denominations?

29
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,750
Do listen, will you. I just told you that.

30
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,440
Yes, you must.

31
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,790
For how long can we keep on?

32
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,730
It's written on the paper.

33
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,290
Pardon, what's up?

34
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,130
What did I tell you?

35
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,390
What's up with Monika?
Huh?

36
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,570
Don't you feel well?

37
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,870
Anyone is whispering?

38
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,280
Was it Jan? Per-Arne?

39
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,280
Is it Anita?

40
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,290
Who whispered? Tell me ...

41
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,740
Don't mess with that now.

42
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,130
Mikael you can hand over your math test immediately.
Please.

43
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,450
- Go ahead the rest of you.

44
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,580
Put it on my desk.
- I was just borrowing his eraser.

45
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,980
Don’t you hear? Hand over your math test, you bloody brat!

46
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,960
I was just borrowing his eraser.

47
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,400
Just for once, I try to be consistent.

48
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,670
And it all ends up as a failure.

49
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,520
- No gravy, please.
- Why?

50
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,210
Gravy is delicious.

51
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,750
- Not too much of the fish.

52
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,060
Not too much? But fish is so very healthy.

53
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,270
- You are scanty with the gravy.

54
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,050
"Scanty with the gravy." What talk is that?

55
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,820
Well, here you are then.

56
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,600
You dropped your fish, Tommy!

57
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,020
Leave it! Don't pick up food from the floor.

58
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,780
- Fish!

59
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,130
- And my mother has said that I mustn't eat that, the girl said.
- But if you tell her to try, she must try.

60
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,620
No she started crying.

61
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,070
Those are your sweet kids.

62
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,610
Silence!
You must be silent!

63
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,370
Make these children be quiet. They are awful.

64
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,390
<i>"Higher; a bit higher still."
"That's better."</i>

65
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,880
Look here, you ought to see this.

66
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,880
<i>"This is how a life begins; a life in this world."</i>

67
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:11,770
- Do you have to work with those books every evening?
<i>- "before she should deliver it did start 38 weeks ago."</i>

68
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,780
I never said that one should not have children.

69
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,200
But neither is it obvious.

70
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,790
Before our marriage, you asked me
if I would like to have a child with you.

71
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,730
But I have already explained all that.

72
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,850
It was a quoting from literature.

73
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,030
So that was nothing but idle talk?

74
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,810
<i>"By then hundreds of millions of sperms were on the march."</i>

75
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,720
It was just empty words then?

76
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,380
At that time I meant what I said but ...

77
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,320
You just wanted to go to bed with me, as all men do.

78
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,890
But you don't have the guts to say it.

79
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,460
At least at that time you had a desire.

80
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,180
<i>- "Sperms are fast swimmers; no less than 10 to 20 cm/hour."</i>

81
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,440
- You didn't really want to marry me.
<i>- "Not very imposing you say"</i>

82
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,230
<i>-"but if they were humans"
"that would equal 100 lengths in a 50-metre pool."</i>
- I'm not an intellectual.

83
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,670
That's possible. Mmm ...

84
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,350
Possible. That's possible? What kind of talk is that?

85
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,990
Don't start this all over again, damn it.

86
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,780
I'm dead tired.

87
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,550
I have so bloody much to do that I won't cope.

88
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,760
I think I'll have to get rid of my guitar.

89
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,530
Do you want to have a little child with me?

90
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,900
What?

91
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,310
Well, it was just a joke.

92
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,270
It's a literary quote I read somewhere.

93
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,400
- How many children do you have?

94
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,810
Two.

95
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,880
Frankly I'd like to have many more.

96
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,580
Children are wonderful.

97
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,490
Why do people have children? For the child's own sake?

98
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,540
And what does the not-yet-begotten child want?

99
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,830
Does it want to attend elementary school?

100
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,750
Become a professor?
Have a supplementary pension?

101
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,500
Never have to be scared. Does it want to sleep?

102
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,960
Why don't you have children?

103
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,940
Because I'm fearful.

104
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,800
Don't you have class at this hour?

105
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,030
I'm on my way for the swimming-hall with the children.

106
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,330
And you?

107
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,600
Well, my kids have woodcraft,

108
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,410
so I'm free from the creeps at the moment.

109
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,450
Aren't you going draw something you as well?

110
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,570
I cannot.

111
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,330
O yes you can. Have a go.

112
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,060
A nice variety you have there, not bad at all.

113
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:55,040
It makes room for ... for imagination.

114
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,460
Shouldn't you sit down for a while and paint, Bengt?

115
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,760
I cannot paint.

116
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,410
O yes you can.

117
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:08,810
Make a test painting. Just make some colour strokes ...
Yes, that one is finished.

118
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:15,010
Like the one Mikael has done; just some vivid colours.

119
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,430
Finish that one and then paint a bird.

120
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,470
What is that supposed to be?

121
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,380
You are crazy!
Sir!

122
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,050
Look what Bengt has done. He's so darn peevish.

123
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,690
Apologize to her.

124
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,810
Go to your place. Go to your place!

125
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,880
Go and sit down at your own desk.

126
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,990
Bloody hell.

127
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,520
What are you saying?

128
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,560
What did you say?

129
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,580
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

130
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,870
Go and sit down.

131
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,160
And make something!

132
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,840
Do you hear me?

133
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:38,490
Dip your paintbrush in the ... in the cup immediately!
And paint something!

134
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,130
Dismissed.
Bengt, you remain.

135
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,100
Hurry up.

136
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,260
And what about us now? Eh?

137
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,510
It's just as awkward for me this incident.

138
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:42,330
What would you have done in a situation like this?
Eh?

139
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,120
Wouldn't you have told me to apologize?

140
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,810
Do you think that I treat you incorrectly?
Do you think I'm unfair? Eh?

141
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,870
What do you say; shouldn't we try being friends after all?

142
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,100
And be on civil terms?

143
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,010
I'll go half way and you'll go half way.

144
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,700
Eh?

145
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,700
Well then, let's forget all about this.

146
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,250
Agreed?

147
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,360
Let's forget about this. Now you can go.
Go now and join the others.

148
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,280
See you, Bengt.

149
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,760
I said see you, Bengt!

150
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,630
"One is raising the alarm."

151
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,590
"Its warning call is transmitted
all along the rock-face."

152
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,180
"A lone razorbill is listening
and turns its eyes to the sky."

153
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:18,280
"It would be natural to think that the guillemots
should unite and chase the gull away"

154
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,050
"but instead they act as if paralyzed."

155
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,260
"With experience inherited through centuries"

156
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:28,360
"they yield to the most persistent of all scavengers."

157
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,390
That's it.
Now class 6D will leave the room while 6C stay behind.

158
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,090
Gather the chairs together when I give the command.

159
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,530
Pick up the chairs nice and neatly.

160
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:53,260
- Sir. Sir.
- Attention! I said nice and quietly.

161
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,590
Sir...
Should they be pulled up or be left as they are?

162
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:10,910
Stop it, will you!
Everyone not told to stay, leave!

163
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,690
I told you to leave.

164
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,230
Wait a second, Ann-Mari. I'll take care of that.

165
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,160
That one is a bit tricky you see.

166
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,450
- Yes, that one is troublesome.
- It gets stuck sometimes.

167
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,960
There, an extra push.

168
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,850
Thanks for letting us attend this class.

169
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,060
Thank you. I should thank you.
It was so nice of you to join us.

170
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,110
That machine gives me the chill.

171
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,640
I constantly fear that I'll tear the film to shreds.

172
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,050
How do you manage really?

173
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,790
Manage what?

174
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,530
With your class.

175
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,030
You clearly see the difference between yours and mine.

176
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,660
Well yes.

177
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,030
Have you ever given the proper boy
the proper smack in his face
at the proper moment?

178
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,850
No ...

179
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,030
No, classes differ from each other.

180
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,050
There's nothing to be done about that.

181
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,360
I cannot be consistent at a certain moments.
I don't know; maybe I'm too weak ...

182
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,420
I slacken in the crucial moment.

183
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,870
Modern research bears in mind what goes on

184
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,630
within a person that acts in a special way.

185
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,160
It's turning into some other kind of ...

186
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,480
well modern religion that one has to take into account ...

187
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,630
Shouldn't you be on duty today?

188
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,070
Pardon?

189
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,440
Aren't you on the duty roster today?

190
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,050
Come and let's sort this out, will you.

191
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,400
Did you take the cap?

192
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,970
No.

193
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,000
They were fighting.

194
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,680
- Were you fighting?
- No ...  We were playing.

195
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,830
He's lying.

196
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,550
He did take it.

197
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,870
Did you take it?

198
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,090
He could have lost it.

199
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,090
No, he did take it!

200
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,080
Then Ivan picked it up.

201
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
What do you say, Ivan?

202
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,790
I put it on the fence.

203
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,880
But now it's not there.

204
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,040
- Bengt, who took that cap?
- I don't know.

205
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,970
I tell you, he took it.

206
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,580
- Move along now and let me sort this out.
- Just a second, please.

207
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,520
Where is the cap, Bengt?

208
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,720
Kent must have his cap back.
Otherwise, you'll have to buy him a new one...

209
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,340
...and that's final.

210
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,950
Eh, you know, boys will be boys.

211
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,780
Yes, but someone should have a smacking to remember.

212
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,140
Sir!

213
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,030
Kent found it!

214
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,030
Found what? ... 'The hole'?

215
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:31,930
NO!

216
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,500
Push him into the water!

217
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,320
Hey, teacher's coming!

218
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,560
This way. Hello! This way.

219
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:18,470
No, you mustn't touch any of the exhibited objects.
Absolutely not!

220
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,970
Come here everybody!

221
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,140
Stop that, Bengt. Stop it.
Come here and listen

222
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,300
It is a bit old fashioned and baroque shaped.

223
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,020
Do you still see that it is decorated in a rococo manner?

224
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,300
And do you see all the flowers and the rippled frame?

225
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:50,090
Now you can see that flowers and nature
were really up-to-date in the 18th century.

226
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,760
Can I have your attention, please?

227
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,560
Look at this little girl.

228
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,280
You can see how
abundantly she is decorated with flowers, all over.

229
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,020
"Are you prepared to attend a ball at my home?"
she seems to say.

230
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,460
"You can all see how smartly we are dressed up."

231
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,000
"We come all dressed up in silk,"

232
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,540
"and I wonder if you can hear the rustling from all our silk."

233
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,630
"Here we enter our dining room,"

234
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,990
"and to not bore you,
I will bring forth a little orchestra."

235
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,140
Are we allowed to stay behind to have a second look?

236
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,230
Have you ever spotted such an animal in the woods?

237
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,130
O my, how cute it is!

238
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,550
They are fighting for the prey you see.

239
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,540
It's got exactly the same thumb as I've got.

240
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,280
- This is a gorilla.

241
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,570
Right, this is a gorilla.

242
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,830
You can see that on its face.

243
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,330
- O, how mighty fine teeth he's got.
- Wow, a newborn human baby.

244
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,500
So beautiful his teeth are. No fillings, eh?

245
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,920
He has probably never eaten any sweets.

246
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,380
Or could it really be genuine teeth?

247
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,340
Look here. It has got some hair.

248
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,670
Have you seen this Olle?

249
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,710
Måtensson.

250
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,010
Yes, how do you do, Mrs Persson?

251
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,450
Really?

252
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,410
Yes.

253
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,090
No, of course they are not allowed to do that,

254
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,640
but it's quite impossible to supervise them every moment.

255
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,190
And by the way ...

256
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,640
Of course I'll talk to Bengt, yes I will.

257
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,020
No, they are not allowed to do that, but ...

258
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,930
But Jane could also have ...

259
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,290
May I be excused?

260
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,710
Good morning children.

261
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,620
Good morning, sir.

262
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,780
Be seated.

263
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,670
I only wish to have a peek in the class register.

264
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,520
Well you know ... it's the same old story, the background,

265
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,990
foster parents, 

266
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,370
his mother having younger children
and doesn't care about him.

267
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,490
He simply ruins the whole class, like a venom.

268
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,400
Well ...
Is it true that you fight with the kids?

269
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,370
A report about that has been sent
to the local education authority.

270
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,410
Honestly, what did you do?

271
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,270
I don't pay any personal attention to it.

272
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,390
I assume that you deal with whatever you have to deal with,

273
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,540
in accordance with your own judgement

274
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,850
But a bad reputation always undermines, so to speak.

275
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,700
Not least among the children.

276
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,160
If a kid says "My dad has told me that my teacher is no good"

277
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,630
then ... then that is no good.

278
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,930
You ...

279
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,000
It might be a good thing to summon a parent-teacher meeting.

280
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,480
Arrange something nice an evening and talk to them.

281
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,940
I think that might ease ... 

282
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:42,040
this atmosphere ... that has arisen.

283
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,990
Well yes, that might be an option. You might be right in this.

284
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,390
Let's agree about that.

285
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,470
Give my regards to Gunvor.

286
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,410
Yes, I will thank you.

287
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,000
Well, perhaps I'd better ...

288
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,620
better mention.
We are in the midst of a transit period.

289
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,480
On the one hand we have the authoritarian, old fashion school;

290
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,050
an autocratic school almost,

291
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:29,400
on the other we have the new, more democratic school.

292
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,750
We teachers are facing a big dilemma by this.

293
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:44,740
We are standing with one leg in the old system

294
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,560
and with the other in the new one.

295
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,730
We cannot get around that we are human beings

296
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,480
and that we still make all kinds of mistakes,

297
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,680
already done in times before us.

298
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,660
We become too authoritative.

299
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,570
The children demand ...

300
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,470
demand total justice; that we should be impartial,

301
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,120
that we shall treat everyone in exactly the same way.

302
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,610
In my point of view ...

303
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,810
if I'd treat everyone alike

304
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,920
 then I'd look upon myself as a villain.

305
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,990
In my opinion every child should be treated

306
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,480
in accordance with its own conditions.

307
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,450
A major part of the time I spend in the classroom

308
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:41,660
is set aside to give the pupils
some basic rules of democracy.

309
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,160
Maybe I'd better make a halt here.

310
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,160
Sir, speaking of the political... of politics;

311
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,300
as far as I can see it.

312
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:54,840
that is not a subject for children 11, 12 and 13 years of age.

313
00:43:55,070 --> 00:44:00,020
In due time they'll learn about democracy and dictatorship.

314
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,530
I'll have to ask you;
is it really necessary to get 20 sums for homework?

315
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,760
We must have in mind
that they are on the eve of entering Upper school.

316
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,790
We must consider their proficiency.

317
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,220
It might be a disturbance for them
to be treated too democratically.

318
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,120
Maybe we should follow a slightly stricter line.

319
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,170
I do think that ... that other parents here would agree.

320
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:27,250
For instance, if the children will sell 'May-Day-flowers'
or flowers to benefit the blind;

321
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,030
some of them accept to sell 50 or 100 flowers.

322
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:35,970
This causes those who are not born salesmen
to accept the same amount.

323
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:39,990
And this often causes the parents to have to step in

324
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,850
and be helpful with this flower business.

325
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,380
And they aren't really listening at the morning assemblies

326
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,640
more than on Fridays.

327
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:55,660
Shouldn't we more eagerly stand up
for the Christian values and ...

328
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:02,860
Regarding corporal punishment, I too am against it, but ...

329
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:06,390
sometimes we have to face a situation

330
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,910
that becomes too much to handle.

331
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,230
I deeply regret

332
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,680
if that could lead to violence and aggression.

333
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,300
I just want to say one thing;

334
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:22,040
we had a teacher who was extremely strict.

335
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,480
He was strict enough to use caning as a means.

336
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,020
He whacked us in the neck and in other parts.

337
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,850
But I must admit, we suffered no harm by that,

338
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,350
and we were taught good manners!

339
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:39,230
I think that all of us parents also must consider
the situation for the teacher.

340
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,740
A vigorous class could be troublesome to handle.

341
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,700
Soon there won’t be one single week or month

342
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,060
without some kind of collection

343
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:54,040
for the benefit of one person or another,

344
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,450
or a country of some kind.

345
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,100
I only want to make it clear; I didn't have

346
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,460
caning or slapping in mind.

347
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,550
But the pupils must realize ...

348
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:10,030
that it is the teacher who sets the rules; easy and clear.

349
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,810
And fair!

350
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,580
Then sir, I'm sure you'll realize

351
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,560
that everything will run smoother,

352
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:20,870
and you'll get along better with the pupils, sir.

353
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,990
Pick up your songbooks.

354
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,430
Sir, let's sing 'The Flower'?

355
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,680
No, nr 213, sir.

356
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,530
Silence. Hush, hush.

357
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:21,950
Be quiet! Pick up your books and see page 44 ... 42.

358
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:27,710
Kjell, you go to the blackboard.

359
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,880
Point at the notes when I'm playing.

360
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,570
Use your hand.

361
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,530
Pick up the pointer again.

362
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,300
You devilish bastard!

363
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,450
Now I have had enough.

364
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,840
What did you say?

365
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,720
Who do you think you are?! Eh?

366
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,910
You're not even humans.

367
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:09,750
Pick up your exercise books; exercise nr 145.

368
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,280
One four five.

369
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,220
Ejnar gives you his regards.

370
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:22,910
Oh.
What?

371
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,930
He just gives you his regards.

372
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,660
Well yes.

373
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,120
Now you have given me his regards.

374
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,210
Shall I send him yours?

375
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,040
No, I don't think so.

376
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:49,510
He is a good teacher, isn't he?

377
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,980
He has ...

378
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:05,740
It's an easy matter for him.

379
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:10,330
When he raises his voice, the class is quiet. But when ...

380
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,070
I ...

381
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,610
I'm unable to ... I don't have ...

382
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:59,600
Well, couldn't you at least pretend?

383
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,240
It might help.

384
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,240
Dammit, what a gross picture.

385
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,070
Did you see it? Look!

386
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,640
I'm in for it.

387
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,260
Is there any tea left?

388
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:36,840
Do you want some?

389
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:38,810
No thank you.

390
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,610
I'll have some.

391
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,560
Well then, good night.

392
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:53,140
Yes, good night.

393
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:56,040
"Saint Lucia, Saint Lucia."

394
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,820

"Saint Lucia, Saint Lucia."

397
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:18,690
Thank you very much.

398
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,510
How nice of you. Thank you.

399
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,410
Do you want some too?

400
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,600
Would you like a bun?

401
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:49,280
Not?

402
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,510
Yes, please.

403
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:08,210
Have you been in many houses?

404
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,280
Nice children you've got.

405
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,670
This is better than if I'd dressed up, not?

406
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,730
Can I have some more?

407
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:45,320
Have you been at other people's homes too?

408
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,290
No.

409
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,410
Don't you want to sit down?

410
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,100
Oops!

00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:16,290
"Night paces heavily, round farm and cottage"

421
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,900
“Lo! Stands on threshold brow”

“white clad with candle crown”

00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:35,710
“Saint Lucia, Saint Lucia.”

424
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:14,900
Boys, calm down a bit, will you.

425
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:32,590
No running up there!

426
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,040
"LADIES"
Neither into the ...

427
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,520
Gather round me!

428
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,890
Tell those in the shower, will you!

429
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,890
Gather round me.

430
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,430
Tell those in the shower!

431
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,040
Attention everybody.

432
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:09,290
Those of you who cannot swim, you stick to this pool.

433
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,170
The others can swim for a water skills certificate,

434
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:18,030
and those kids must keep within these red rubber bands.

435
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,670
Is that clear?

436
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:23,260
And the cafe is forbidden area. Is that clear?

437
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:24,360
Yes.

438
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,310
Can we go in the water now, sir?

439
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:26,890
Pardon?

440
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,000
Can we go in the water now, sir?

441
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,330
Yes.

442
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,460
Yeah! Watch me!

443
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:57,540
That's right. Nice and easy. Long and steady strokes.

444
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,260
You are leaving one strand of hair here.

445
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,710
That's enough.

446
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,710
Hurry up will you.

447
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:44,550
Are you longing for summer, longing for summer?

448
01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:01,230
Don't throw snowballs like that. Do you hear me?

449
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:22,200
I don't know who is throwing snowballs,
but cut that out will you.

450
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,340
Cut it out!

451
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,820
Now you walk ahead of me! 

452
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:49,020
Hurry.

453
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,530
Walk ahead of me ... Come on.

454
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,680
You really had a good time in the park today, eh?

455
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:05,760
When you threw snowballs with pebbles at me.

456
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,970
What have I done to you? Have I done anything to you?

457
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:13,850
What offence have I committed? Being a teacher?

458
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:15,180
And that I have feelings?

459
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,410
I know that school sucks,

460
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:20,290
but you have never been grown ups.

461
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:25,370
In due time you'll get to know what that means.

462
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:31,810
Don't make faces at me do you hear?

463
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,240
I do try being a good sport.

464
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,850
I do try my very best.

465
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,800
So I think you could give a little something in return.

466
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,290
Pick up ...

467
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,100
I strongly dislike acting like this.

468
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:51,820
I really have to say that,

469
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:59,280
but sometimes you can face a situation
when you have to.

470
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:16,720
Maybe you'll come up here and hold class instead of me.
Eh?

471
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,470
Open your books and get page 173 and ...

472
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:35,300
we'll start working with those tasks.

473
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,990
And no babbling!

474
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:43,860
If anyone wants to ask something,
you put up your hand.

475
01:07:56,350 --> 01:08:00,400
Can I sharpen my pen?

476
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:02,930
Go ahead.

477
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:13,550
- Well?
- May I pick up my book?

478
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:32,890
- Yes?
- May I ask Lena if I can borrow her eraser?

479
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:51,260
I dropped a strand of hair may I pick it up?

480
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,500
Enough!

481
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,610
I don't want to hear the slightest sound!

482
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,230
One tiny peep from someone and I'll throw him out.

483
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:59,990
May I borrow the key to my classroom,
because I've left my bag behind?

484
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,840
Pardon?

485
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:08,760
Would you please unlock the door, sir,
because I've left my bag behind?

486
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:13,460
So you want your bag ...

487
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,740
In which classroom do you dwell?

488
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:23,160
Over here.

489
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:39,240
The umbrella, the umbrella, the umbrella!
Yes hold it right there. That's it!

490
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:43,020
And now hold the umbrella above you. That's good.

491
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,630
Be still, still, still. How nice.

492
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:48,180
How nice. Put your mind on the clothes.

493
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,930
Stretch down you knickers a bit.
That's good. How nice.

494
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,000
Stretch out a little.

495
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:53,690
And put your foot a bit outwards.

496
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,190
Good. That's good, Gunnel.

497
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:58,690
Yes, very beautiful. Mind your hair. How nice.

498
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:02,150
Keep still. Bend oven a little to the left.

499
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,760
The light is so beautiful now.

500
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,040
Be still, absolutely still.

501
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,300
I only want ... 

502
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,200
Move an inch in that direction.

503
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:11,710
Yes! Yes! Yes! How nice.

504
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:14,530
It so beautiful right now. Stretch the skirt a bit.

505
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:18,120
And hold the umbrella upwards a tiny, tiny inch higher.

506
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,370
Be still. And now turn some degrees in the other direction,

507
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:23,980
towards the light, a tiny, tiny bit. How nice.

508
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,140
No, leaning forwards is much better. How nice.

509
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:29,060
And now hold the umbrella in the other hand.

510
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,900
Hey, the fringe; pull it forwards a tiny, tiny, tiny bit.

511
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:35,640
And fully calm.

512
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,710
And change the position of the foot.

513
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:45,940
How nice. Wait a second; I'll just raise it a bit.

514
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,940
Are you cold?

515
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,170
How nice.

516
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:55,850
Wow, how beautiful! Very good.
Just move around a tiny, tiny bit more.

517
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,980
How nice. Just a moment,
I'll switch to the other cassette.

518
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:01,230
Can you carry on a bit more?

519
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:04,300
Yes, it's too darn cold.

520
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:08,730
A little longer, eh? OK, good.

521
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:12,260
No, to that direction. That's nice, very beautiful.

522
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,640
Bend your head. Yes. No, the other direction. Too much!

523
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,200
And pull your hair forwards, yes, forwards.

524
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,220
And don't move.

525
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:28,480
Yes, that's very nice. Thank you!

526
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:32,010
You are fabulous.

527
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,170
Sören!
Hello!

528
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:45,350
Hello! How nice to see you. You haven't changed a bit!

529
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,750
I haven't? Well, neither have you.

530
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,750
I've been shouting here all day long.

531
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:55,290
It was amusing to watch to work.
It's so cold, but the girl suffers more.

532
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,990
What are you doing this far out?

533
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:03,690
Well, I'm just walking around.

534
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:06,460
Are these from China ... Japan?

535
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:10,860
It's from Hiroshima.
I took it many years ago.

536
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,980
- I see.
- Some 12, 13 years ago.

537
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,310
You travel a lot, don't you?

538
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:18,740
Yes, I like to move around.

539
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,240
Please, do excuse me if I'm poking with my cameras.

540
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,030
By all means.

541
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:32,540
You see, next week I'm going away on a documentary trip to ...

542
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,390
eastward ... to Soviet.

543
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:35,850
I see!

544
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:37,640
Three months.

545
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,040
I'm just checking the light meter.

546
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,380
You have an exiting life, haven't you?

547
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,590
Well yes, there are new views every day,
but that could be pretty tough sometimes.

548
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:50,250
I'd have appreciated if I could stick
to a more strict routine.

549
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:55,450
What about you? You are ... a teacher, aren't you?

550
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,320
Yes.

551
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,140
I'd never have imagined that.

552
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:04,730
No, but there are lots of things
you never could have imagined about yourself ...

553
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,680
Teaching is really an important job,

554
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,040
to distribute knowledge.

555
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:13,340
That must be wonderful.

556
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,520
How are you getting along with it?

557
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,910
Well yes ...

558
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,010
Say ...

559
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:25,490
Do you mind if I steal a look into this?

560
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:27,100
By all means no. Please do.

561
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:34,910
That one is a draft for a book
I intend to publish if possible.

562
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:52,800
My big issue is that I ...

563
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:58,540
I side with the pupils ...

564
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:02,360
against myself.

565
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:06,510
The fact that you can see things from ...

566
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:08,890
both sides ...

567
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:11,790
might be why matters seems ...

568
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:15,300
to becomes more tricky for you than for others.

569
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:18,190
But what about you? You ...

570
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:24,220
For me life is a constant race.
I always have to find something new, new, new!

571
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:28,300
At the same moment I've mastered a new skill
I simply have to do it in another way.

572
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,290
You are establishing things.

573
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:38,440
You work with the foundation,
whilst I work upstairs trying to make embellishments.

574
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:49,110
Mårten-Tårten.
You called yourself 'Tårtan' at school. Why?

575
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:52,670
That was not me.

576
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,980
You were much brawnier when you were young.

577
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:59,020
Every time we had a tussle ...
I was in fact a bit scared of you.

578
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:03,590
Do you remember these? Eh?
O no, that one's for me!

579
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,060
You were always so swift.

580
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,390
Mind my cameras! Look behind you!

581
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:17,180
Now I will give you …

582
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:22,260
I give up! I give up. The victory is yours!
You are the victor, the victor.

583
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:42,990
No, no, stop it!

584
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,520
Quiet!

585
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,950
- Don't you have class now?
- No!

586
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:55,740
He's out drinking some water.

587
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:25,000
Why do you keep on?

588
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,050
I'm waiting.

589
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:37,310
For what?

590
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:41,390
For my retirement.

591
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,280
But there must have been occasions when you ...

592
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:50,640
When I've had ambitions?

593
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:57,670
Yes, as a matter of fact there were.

594
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:03,090
But that was quite some time ago.

595
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:12,360
Your move I think.

596
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,330
…? O yes.

597
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,370
May I sharpen my pen?

598
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:33,560
Could you get it in?

599
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,130
Get in what?

600
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:38,970
The dick.

601
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:25,890
Class terminated! You are dismissed.

602
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,000
Take it easy!

603
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:03,070
Sit down. You stay put.

604
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:09,640
Lay down at the door
so that I can see you though the key hole.

605
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,670
Well, Jane.

606
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:20,250
What do you have to say about this?

607
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:25,400
Was that a nice thing to do, do you think?

608
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,540
Is that a proper word to come out with?

609
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,010
Say something.

610
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,840
Well then, let's go home
and discuss this with your mother.

611
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,070
She's not at home.

612
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:46,200
Then we discuss it with your daddy.

613
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:47,300
He's not at home either.

614
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,730
No problems,
we'll wait there until any of them comes home.

615
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,500
Come on. Don't fuss.

616
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:29,610
Let's go.

617
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:36,360
Please, sir,
I promise never to say a thing like that anymore.

618
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:40,450
As long as I don't tell your parents?

619
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,570
Well then, I won't.

620
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:53,350
But there's one thing I want you to understand.

621
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,790
There are things in life you must try to ...

622
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,200
try to keep ... 

623
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,430
clean ...

624
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,870
shining,

625
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:13,440
things that cannot bear to be stained.

626
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,600
Off you go.

627
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:00,220
Monika, jump up here.

628
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,600
You shall stick to the yellow ribbons. 

629
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:31,030
 And then ... should someone go astray,
try to return the same way.

630
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:32,880
Keep the ribbons in sight.

631
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,380
Don't enter the woods without having a ribbon in sight!

632
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,280
Nice. Thanks.

633
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,850
- Is there more?
- Yes.

634
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:18,040
- Yes. Cheese or sausage?
- Sausage.

635
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:42,520
Strange so ... so far away everything seems to be.

636
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:54,940
I wonder about the cause for one's worries;
for one's troubles?

637
01:28:58,370 --> 01:29:01,890
Yet you know that it's always there for you;

638
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:05,000
you have to return to it.

639
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:10,030
If it was able to ...

640
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:15,930
to keep that enthusiasm you once had ...

641
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:18,900
when you entered your career.

642
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:21,570
The ambition was to ...

643
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:26,190
to participate in creating the world.
Now you're going to ...

644
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:33,510
You ...

645
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:42,590
fail ... you fail ...

646
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,600
when you're standing in front of them,

647
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,490
then all the theories fall apart.

648
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:59,460
You cannot hide anywhere. You ...

649
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:03,410
have to cope.

650
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:47,870
Tell Mr Eriksson to call an ambulance, quickly! Hurry!

651
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:38,950
Murder. Murder. Murder! Murder! Murder! ...

652
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:15,340
Gunvor. Are you asleep?
Gunvor.

653
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,360
It's me.

654
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:23,960
Whats the matter?

655
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:27,730
I had a nightmare.

656
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:40,090
Satan! To hell with school.

657
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:50,850
I always wake up with this bloody,
nervous stomach-ache.

658
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,760
It's the same every morning.

659
01:34:56,620 --> 01:35:00,010
I’m frightened to enter the classroom.

660
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:07,860
I'll let the pupils do what they want.
I don't give a damn.

661
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:11,290
I can't take it any more.

662
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,440
You make everything too knotty.

663
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:21,300
Do I make it knotty?
What should I do then?
Eh?

664
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,340
I don't know.

665
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:26,310
You'll have to make it simple.

666
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:29,180
Make it simple? It's not that simple.

667
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,950
Ejnar says that you ...

668
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:42,160
that you must empty your thoughts on yourself.

669
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:51,160
You shall only BE yourself.
What the heck does that mean really;
to be yourself?

670
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:57,230
Well, if you are born like me
you'll have to face that fact.

671
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:02,790
If you're focused, then it doesn't matter
if you close your eyes

672
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:07,470
or not. You know if you're alert.

673
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,940
- Eh?
- Yes.

674
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:18,410
What happened to that ... boy on the schoolyard?

675
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:20,410
I don't know.

676
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:24,160
His condition is said to be critical still.

677
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:37,190
Eh ... do you honestly like children?

678
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,800
Yes I think so; one at a time.

679
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:47,620
Mostly I pity them.

680
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:55,260
But when they're wicked ... then I hate them.

681
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:57,160
Never mind.

682
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,780
I don't differ from people in general.

683
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:08,130
It's not a matter of giving you a personal reprimand.
You understand that.

684
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:11,050
You are not to blame that an accident could take place.

685
01:41:11,790 --> 01:41:17,910
The major issue is the difficulties with
how to supervise the children on the schoolyard.

686
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:23,700
A thing like this must never happen. It must never happen!

687
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,390
You understand that.

688
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:32,000
And in the bitter end,
the full responsibility rests in my hands ...
and on the school.

689
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:38,060
That's all.

690
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:45,330
Give my regards to Gunvor.
I heard she's on her way to Stockholm.

691
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:51,760
Do you have any money ... and some place to stay?

692
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,530
Yes, thank you. I'll be fine.

693
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:00,460
- I can take that.
- No.

694
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,960
I'll be fine.

695
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:26,570
You shouldn't run that far out!

696
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:31,440
Do you hear me? You must not swim in deep water.

697
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:38,950
Help! He's drowning!

698
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:44,550
You are not allowed to swim that far out!

699
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:54,010
You are not allowed to swim in deep water!
Didn't you hear what I said?

700
01:44:58,830 --> 01:45:02,960
You mustn't be this far out!
Don't you hear what I say?

701
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:07,410
You must stay close to the pier.

702
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:22,800
Stop it! ... No ... You mustn't ...!

703
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:45,280
Enough!

705
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
