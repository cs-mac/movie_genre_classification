00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,775
People change

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,859
Do you never are together

Or sit and look are during such passes.

00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:25,350
Need to be strong

9
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,117
That is, even when they are strong,

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,302
because of pressure can break.

11
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:35,261
All of us are a matter of change.

12
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,076
I love sport.

13
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:50,029
I used to play basketball.

14
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:53,506
Now I am a hunter.

15
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,914
I know it sounds funny,

16
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,668
that is a hunter in the middle of the city.

17
00:01:01,703 --> 00:01:06,388
But I will hunt and I fly Do you head.

18
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:10,508

00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:07,525
Life has many twists.

21
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,835
There are many obstacles and people
who want to get beat.

22
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,577
It's been a year than I hurt the knee.

Do you not worry about my car.

It's me, mom and my brother Shock.

45
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,732
Dad left the city
for a job

46
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:18,265
He probably found a good one,
because he never returned.

47
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,241
What are you doing mom?

48
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:23,632
Hi, Clarence.

00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,988

51
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:29,388
Why not play as a kid?

52
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:30,999
Why you always play basketball?

53
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:36,507
Because they are hard.

54
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,085
Only you seen the trophies.

55
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,788
What are those? These are false.

56
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:43,421
I have renounced to school, but

57
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:48,233
My brother is very intelligent.
Very expected.

58
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,304

59
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:09,233

I ve some good news and some bad.

63
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,385
The bad news is that Shock

65
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:26,789
The good news is that I can answer

66
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,712

67

I want to recommend
Program for avansai

69
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:38,005

which to measure his level of intellectual.

71
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:42,936

72
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:46,133
may have the opportunity to move
the following class

Single mother took care of us.

83
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,058
When things started to gather,

84
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,386
my mother said to me looking for a job.

85

98
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:13,318

00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:45,335
Police Department?

286
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,414

I'm afraid I ve are bad for you

292
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:08,350
Your mother was shot and killed cata

293
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:09,352
What?

294
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:11,190
in front of barber shops on Park Street Avenue

295
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,795
Leave a store and was surprised

296
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:15,254
of the shots in front of the barber shops

297
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:17,223
we believe that it is

298
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:19,270
a war between bands

299
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:21,082
That's my card

300
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:23,039
I want to call me when you feel able

301
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:25,136
We have counseling services for you

302
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:28,176

303
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,867
have found people who did it?

304
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,571
I'm afraid not so far

305
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,774
but investigations are ongoing

306
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,613
and yet something

307
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:40,200
I want to come to identify body

308
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,823
I'm sorry for your loss

309
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,652
You're sorry?

310
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:00,730
Yes

311
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,521
What happened to Mom?

312
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,263
He was shot and how much

313
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:14,479
After the mother died, I was lost

314
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,976
And I realized how much depended on it

315
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:21,178
He was everything to us

316
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,752
I was confused

317
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,433
I did not know what will I do

318
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,069
Shock, go

319
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,772
where are you going?

320
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:32,459
go to work

321
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,678
I have the keys mother
So if someone comes to the door

322
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,403
may not open

323
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,849
not to open

324
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,753
I know there's nothing to eat, but

325
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,803
one to bring when I go back

326
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,398
bring me cookies

327
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:47,519
d'those that I brought my mother

328
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,551

329
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:52,862
Well, go back later

330
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:01,528

Return to work

334
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:12,181
I washed the floor 5 times

335
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,022

344
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:01,684

345
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,605

382
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:04,299
I think I know who shot my mother

383
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,750
we need a gun

384
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,952

I do not have money for rent

387
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:29,642
but I had enough money for it

388
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:13,727
 knew many blacks are
$ 100 per night

389
00:25:35,815 --> 00:25:38,050
 blacks knew knew not why they are able

390
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:49,047

391
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:50,877

Fuck him

399
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,176
When we shot the Tiny

400
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,685
I believe that everything will come by itself

401
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:57,543
Clean the scenario

402
00:27:57,578 --> 00:27:59,762
is that we lost free

403
00:28:00,108 --> 00:28:01,655
but even then,

404
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,014
I did not know what to do next

405
00:28:04,244 --> 00:28:06,140
still do not have money to rent

406
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:08,904
but this will not bring my mother back

407
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,109
Damn

408
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:16,112
not located what to do

409
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:27,668
I do not think we can sit together

410
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,937
What are you?

411
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,230
I can not take care of you

412
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:36,171

413
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,717

414
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,248
not make any sense what you say

415
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,483
You Focus on school, right?

416
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,002
I think about the things adults

417
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,942
even if I told him to shut up

418
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,811
I knew that's right

419
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,807
and I went to see him Sean

420
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:01,910

441
00:30:15,768 --> 00:30:18,277

932
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:18,729
to be careful what I say

933
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:23,537
so not so good at conversation

934
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:27,960
I have little sympathy, but more money

935
01:01:29,913 --> 01:01:31,740

936
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,319

01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,050
in a place like this

986
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,842
because it was not healthy

987
01:07:10,877 --> 01:07:13,139

988
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,423

1000
01:07:52,373 --> 01:07:54,818
Money means freedom

1001
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:59,002
freedom to do what you want

1002
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:01,626
Do you need to fill

1003
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:04,018
Why do baby?

1004

1005
01:08:10,282 --> 01:08:12,579

1006
01:08:27,563 --> 01:08:28,968

1007
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,232

1014
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:25,958
That's it?

1015
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:28,575
What do you mean?

1016
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:30,481
2 minutes?

1017
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:32,887

1018
01:09:33,277 --> 01:09:35,365
best 2 minutes of your life

1019
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:44,934

1020
01:09:45,954 --> 01:09:47,795

1021
01:09:48,031 --> 01:09:49,422

1025
01:09:56,594 --> 01:09:58,339

1026

1027
01:10:05,015 --> 01:10:07,301
I need them

1028
01:10:16,656 --> 01:10:18,653
Why Why you, why not answer

where the hell are my papers?

1030
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:27,650
what the hell is wrong with you?

1031
