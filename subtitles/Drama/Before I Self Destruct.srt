2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,775
People change

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,859
Do you never are together

4
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:14,036

Or sit and look are during such passes.

00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:25,350
Need to be strong

9
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,117
That is, even when they are strong,

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,302
because of pressure can break.

11
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:35,261
All of us are a matter of change.

12
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,076
I love sport.

13
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:50,029
I used to play basketball.

14
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:53,506
Now I am a hunter.

15
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,914
I know it sounds funny,

16
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,668
that is a hunter in the middle of the city.

17
00:01:01,703 --> 00:01:06,388
But I will hunt and I fly Do you head.

18
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:10,508
When it's time to go, go.

Hello!

20
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:07,525
Life has many twists.

21
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,835
There are many obstacles and people
who want to get beat.

22
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,577
It's been a year than I hurt the knee.

I just want to play basketball.
You drive that car.

Give me the rest!

39
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:49,481
Do you not worry about my car.

40
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:52,602

41
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:54,846

Where's mother?

00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:12,044
It's me, mom and my brother Shock.

45
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,732
Dad left the city
for a job

46
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:18,265
He probably found a good one,
because he never returned.

47
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,241
What are you doing mom?

48
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:23,632
Hi, Clarence.

49
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,988
What are you doing boy?

50
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:27,076
Read.

51
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:29,388
Why not play as a kid?

52
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:30,999
Why you always play basketball?

53
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:36,507
Because they are hard.

54
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,085
Only you seen the trophies.

55
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,788
What are those? These are false.

56
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:43,421
I have renounced to school, but

57
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:48,233
My brother is very intelligent.
Very expected.

58
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,304
Hello?

59
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:09,233
Hello, ma'am Jeckins?

60
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:10,613
Yes

61
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,545
Sun in connection with son you, shock.

62
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:16,089
I ve some good news and some bad.

63
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,385
The bad news is that Shock

64
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:23,226
and have become an obi and nuinþã.

65
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:26,789
The good news is that I can answer

66
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,712
absolutely all questions
put on it.

67
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:32,928
And this reason,

68
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:35,287
I want to recommend
Program for avansaþi

69
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:38,005
All you do is to pass an exam,

70
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,525
which to measure his level of intellectual.

71
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:42,936
And depends on how big is the note,

72
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:46,133
may have the opportunity to move
the following class

73
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:56,133

Yes, ma'am.

75
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,884
You can go to class.

76
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:02,008
Do you not to forget the books.

77

Single mother took care of us.

83
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,058
When things started to gather,

84
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,386
my mother said to me looking for a job.

85
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:43,457

As you become a professional player?

98
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:13,318

00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:21,401
School was not my job.

102
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:24,253

What took you so long, Einstein?

179
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:05,812
Was to take a beating, but the teacher said that

00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:07,973

250
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:48,604

And I'm going to talk to her birds

May you remember when we were in the championship and i. ..

279
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:30,151
Words are always the same game

Yes

281
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:34,226

282
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:37,302
But what are you about this?

283
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:41,085
Who?

284
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:43,489
Police Department

285
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:45,335
Police Department?

286
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,414
Hi, Detective Sillivan

287
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:49,207
A know the Mrs. Diane Jenckins?

288
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:50,976

00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:58,836
Shock go to the Board

291
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,992
I'm afraid I ve are bad for you

292
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:08,350
Your mother was shot and killed cata

293
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:09,352
What?

294
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:11,190
in front of barber shops on Park Street Avenue

295
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,795
Leave a store and was surprised

296
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:15,254
of the shots in front of the barber shops

297
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:17,223
we believe that it is

298
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:19,270
a war between bands

299
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:21,082
That's my card

300
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:23,039
I want to call me when you feel able

301
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:25,136
We have counseling services for you

302
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:28,176
and for those affected by this loss

303
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,867
have found people who did it?

304
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,571
I'm afraid not so far

305
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,774
but investigations are ongoing

306
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,613
and yet something

307
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:40,200
I want to come to identify body

308
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,823
I'm sorry for your loss

309
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,652
You're sorry?

310
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:00,730
Yes

311
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,521
What happened to Mom?

312
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,263
He was shot and how much

313
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:14,479
After the mother died, I was lost

314
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,976
And I realized how much depended on it

315
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:21,178
He was everything to us

316
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,752
I was confused

317
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,433
I did not know what will I do

318
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,069
Shock, go

319
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,772
where are you going?

320
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:32,459
go to work

321
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,678
I have the keys mother
So if someone comes to the door

322
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,403
may not open

323
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,849
not to open

324
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,753
I know there's nothing to eat, but

325
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,803
one to bring when I go back

326
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,398
bring me cookies

327
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:47,519
d'those that I brought my mother

328
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,551
one to see what I can do, right?

329
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:52,862
Well, go back later

330
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:01,528

331
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:03,988

333
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:10,321
Return to work

334
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:12,181
I washed the floor 5 times

335
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,022
May wash once

336
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,097
Clarence, come to my office

337
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,298
I am very disappointed in you

338
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:37,814

339
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:38,954

340
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:41,230

342
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:45,245
Just go here
and to not see you ever

343
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,581
steal shit, what the hell is that?

344
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:01,684
what are you doing?

345
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,605

00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:04,299

384
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,952

00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:29,642
but I had enough money for it

388
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:13,727
ã knew many blacks are
$ 100 per night

389
00:25:35,815 --> 00:25:38,050
ã blacks knew knew not why they are able

390
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:49,047

00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:50,877

Fuck him

399
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,176
When we shot the Tiny

400
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,685
I believe that everything will come by itself

401
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:57,543
Clean the scenario

402
00:27:57,578 --> 00:27:59,762
is that we lost free

403
00:28:00,108 --> 00:28:01,655
but even then,

404
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,014
I did not know what to do next

405
00:28:04,244 --> 00:28:06,140
still do not have money to rent

406
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:08,904
but this will not bring my mother back

407
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,109
Damn

408
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:16,112
not located what to do

409
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:27,668
I do not think we can sit together

410
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,937
What are you?

411
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,230
I can not take care of you

412
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:36,171

413
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,717

414
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,248
not make any sense what you say

415
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,483
You Focus on school, right?

416
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,002
I think about the things adults

417
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,942
even if I told him to shut up

418
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,811
I knew that's right

419
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,807
and I went to see him Sean

420
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:01,910

932
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:18,729
to be careful what I say

933
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:23,537
so not so good at conversation

934
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:27,960
I have little sympathy, but more money

935
01:01:29,913 --> 01:01:31,740

936
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,319

01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,050
in a place like this

986
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,842
because it was not healthy

987
01:07:10,877 --> 01:07:13,139

988
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,423

1000
01:07:52,373 --> 01:07:54,818
Money means freedom

1001
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:59,002
freedom to do what you want

1002
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:01,626
Do you need to fill

1003

1006
01:08:27,563 --> 01:08:28,968

1014
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:25,958
That's it?

1015
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:28,575
What do you mean?

1016
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:30,481
2 minutes?

1017
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:32,887

1021
01:09:48,031 --> 01:09:49,422

where the hell are my papers?

1030
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:27,650
