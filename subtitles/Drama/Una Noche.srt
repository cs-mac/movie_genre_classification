1
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,674
Where did you find that trash?

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,053
Tell me! Tell me!

3
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,180
That's filth.

4
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,974
What a way to begin.
You're just like your father.

5
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,976
Tits! That's all he ever cared about.

6
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,357
You think he was a hero, right?

7
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,151
I can tell you
a couple of things about him.

8
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:18,453
I'll kill you if I find trash like this in the house again.

9
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,372
Get the trash can.

10
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,791
I'll burn all this.

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,959
Don't stay there, stupid!

12
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,670
Come on!

13
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,716
Bastard, you must have taught
this to your kid

14
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,260
so he could grow up to be like you.

15
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,763
You're a pig.

16
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,269
I'm sure there's more trash
around here.

17
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,658
Don't be stupid
and get the trash can. Hurry up!

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,801
THE NIGHT HAS 1000 SCREAMS

19
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,648
I knew something was wrong
when I arrived.

20
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,817
It was all very calm.

21
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,819
Oh, my God.
Have you seen this?

22
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,237
- What is it?
- An arm.

23
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,281
Oh, my God.

24
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,283
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

25
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,326
There should be a boy,
little Timmy.

26
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,912
- What's in there?
- This is his room.

27
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,958
Oh, my.

28
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,544
Whoever did this,
is completely crazy.

29
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,962
It's terrible.

30
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,298
I've never seen so much blood.

31
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,716
There must be something here.

32
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,931
That's Mrs. Weldon.

33
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:11,519
I knew it. I knew something bad
had happened. Oh, my God.

34
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,146
Please, go with her.

35
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,439
Don't worry, I'm fine.

36
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,609
Don't move.

37
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,238
- It was a big man, very big.
- Oh, Timmy.

38
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,781
Very big-

39
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,784
Calm down, Timmy.
Where is his father?

40
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,621
He passed away in Europe.

41
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,205
In the Air Force.

42
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,083
But he has an aunt
who lives nearby.

43
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,713
I'll call her. I'll go get her.
This is terrible.

44
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,758
40 YEARS LATER

45
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,611
Mom.

46
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,700
Mom, where are you?

47
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,834
Mom, come back!

48
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,649
Will you take long?
Otherwise, I'll move.

49
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,985
Just a minute, miss.

50
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,903
Fine.

51
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,386
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

52
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,889
I'm sure the Dean
will see you soon.

53
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,016
Don't worry,
we're used to this.

54
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,101
Did you know the girl?

55
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,437
Well, I don't really remember.

56
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,355
This university is big.

57
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,483
It's very hard
to remember all the students.

58
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,153
Yes, Dean?

59
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,905
Are those gentlemen still there?

60
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,782
- Yes, sir.
- Very well. I'll be right out.

61
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,284
Fine.

62
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,291
You must be Bracken.

63
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,878
- Lieutenant Bracken.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

64
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,213
Sergeant Holden.

65
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,964
- How are you, Sergeant?
- How are you?

66
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,424
Come in, please.

67
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,302
Grace, don't send in
any call, please.

68
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,012
Come in.

69
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,266
What terrible business.

70
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,310
Have you heard the latest news?

71
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,063
There's a water bed in the gym.
What do you think?

72
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,732
Have you ever laid
on a water bed?

73
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,901
The most wonderful feeling
in the world

74
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,027
is smoking a joint

75
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,780
and at the same time
doing it on a water bed.

76
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,660
Watch out. He's there.

77
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,453
You'll see.

78
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,707
Professor Brown.

79
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,835
Excuse me, sir,
can I ask you a question?

80
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,629
Where are the pectorals?

81
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,591
My classmates say
mine are very funny.

82
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:20,638
I assure you
there's nothing wrong with yours.

83
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,224
Yes, but where are they?

84
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,186
Here, right here.

85
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,778
We'll be discreet.

86
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,948
What's happened
is an unfortunate incident...

87
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,619
What a terrible thing,
that murder.

88
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,913
The police are inside.

89
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,040
They think it's someone
from the university.

90
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,044
I won't ask you
how you got that information.

91
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,923
What makes you think that?

92
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,428
Well, the lieutenant says
it looks like an inside job.

93
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,764
Poor Willard.
He found the body.

94
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,600
But they haven't found
the head yet.

95
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,229
I wonder what the murderer
did with it.

96
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,732
- You know? I...
- Will they take long?

97
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,151
I don't know, Professor.

98
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,321
They've been there long.
I don't think they'll take much longer.

99
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,448
But if you prefer
to come back later...

100
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,911
Find Professor Brown, Grace.
He must be in the professor lounge.

101
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,165
He's right here, Dean.
Shall I send him in?

102
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,584
Great. Yes, send him in.

103
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,590
According to our latest data,
there's over 2,000.

104
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,675
I'm glad you came, Arthur.

105
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,346
Let me introduce you
to Lt. Bracken and Sgt. Holden.

106
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,555
Nice to meet you.

107
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,768
I'd like you to show them around.
When's your next class?

108
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,894
Precisely tomorrow.

109
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,271
Tomorrow. Excellent.

110
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,943
They want to ask you
about that girl, Virginia Palmer.

111
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,364
She was in your class,
if I remember correctly.

112
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,871
Professor Brown is in charge
of our Anatomy Department.

113
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,249
Please, show them
everything they want to see.

114
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,295
Don't hesitate to come see me again
if you need anything else.

115
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,838
Now...

116
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,801
I beg you to be discreet.

117
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:27,431
Imagine what it'd be for the university
if this was in the newspapers.

118
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,851
Don't worry.
It wouldn't help us, either.

119
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,269
We'll be discreet.

120
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,357
Fine. I trust you will,
for everyone's sake.

121
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,402
Our version will be that
what happened...

122
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,696
was an unfortunate accident.

123
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,657
I hope people will believe it.

124
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,660
These things
always end up being known,

125
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,038
but, anyway, what's important now
is to buy some time.

126
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,210
I think I've talked too much.
I've got work to do.

127
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,004
I don't think I'll be much help.

128
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,925
I don't remember the girl much.
I've had a lot of students this term.

129
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,177
Come on, Arthur.

130
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,432
You only have one department,
I've got all campus to deal with.

131
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,144
I'm sure you'll do it
better than I would.

132
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,855
Gentlemen, excuse me.
I'm really sorry.

133
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,565
Professor Brown
will show you around.

134
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,194
Thank you, sir.
You've been a great help.

135
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,906
I'm glad. Please,
keep me up to date.

136
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,658
Of course. Don't worry.

137
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,459
So you didn't know the girl well?

138
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,294
- You got a light?
- No, I don't.

139
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:43,215
Do you know
what kind of girl she was?

140
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,093
Was she chasing boys?

141
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,219
She was very attractive,

142
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,055
but I don't remember
if she had a boyfriend.

143
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,057
This is my class. Come in.

144
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,146
Here we study Comparative Anatomy

145
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,899
to use it in Anthropology
and similar courses.

146
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,614
One of the students
brought it as a gift.

147
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,699
I don't know where he got it.

148
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,536
It's the skull of a 16-year-old girl.

149
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,039
I'd like to talk to that boy.
What's his name?

150
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,584
It was a long time ago.

151
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,297
You don't think
one of our boys killed her?

152
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,760
Our job is like identifying
clothes without tags.

153
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,470
We have to check everything.

154
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,555
That girl,
did she have friends in class?

155
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,891
Yes, she was very popular.

156
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,938
If you come to my office, I'll give you
some names that might help you.

157
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,524
Thank you very much, Professor.

158
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,693
We have to start somewhere.
We don't even have the forensic report.

159
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,570
Fine.

160
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,841
Willard.

161
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,845
When do you expect
to finish your work on campus?

162
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,890
I don't know.
One or two weeks.

163
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,685
But don't worry,
it won't cost you more.

164
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,396
It's the agreement I made
with your secretary.

165
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,316
- Everything's included.
- Yes, I know.

166
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,529
But the sooner you finish,
the sooner you can work somewhere else.

167
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,615
And I guess
that's what's best for you.

168
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,993
Yes. I'll finish
as soon as possible.

169
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,369
Okay.

170
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,485
How about a swim
in the pool by ourselves?

171
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,485
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

172
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,820
Are you leaving? So soon?

173
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,072
Yes, I have to study.
That Brown is terrible.

174
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,907
There he is.
What a weird guy.

175
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,243
Always by himself.

176
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,788
How sexy.

177
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,087
- See you.
- Bye.

178
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,457
Kendall?

179
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,202
Have you seen Kendall?

180
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,747
Yes, he's over there.

181
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,332
Thank you.

182
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,542
By the way,
are you free this afternoon?

183
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,881
That's what I was saying,
you're not free.

184
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,092
Kendall, I finally found you.

185
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,385
This is for you.

186
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,553
What is it?

187
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,889
What do I know?
I just know it's urgent.

188
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,807
Where have you been?

189
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,310
I looked for you
all over campus.

190
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,354
I was here before,
and you weren't here.

191
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,523
Alister, when did you get this?

192
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,275
About half an hour ago.

193
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,902
Half an hour?

194
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,154
That's weird.

195
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,157
Tell me. My lips are sealed.

196
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,744
- Yes, I know.
- See you.

197
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,647
Leave him.

198
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,207
Don't move.

199
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,251
Stop or I'll blow your brains.

200
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,654
I don't envy your job.

201
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,823
Nobody realizes
how terrible it is.

202
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,408
Thank you for coming
so quickly, Professor.

203
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,869
Hank, get me that.

204
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,288
I need your help.

205
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,040
I don't have
the forensic report yet,

206
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:46,670
and I need to know now
if this, this slaughter,

207
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,381
has been done with that saw.

208
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,066
Wait, don't touch it.

209
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,026
You could smudge the fingerprints.

210
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,990
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

211
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,659
I'm not a pathologist, but...

212
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,830
I could almost guarantee
that it was done with that.

213
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,293
Or with something very similar.

214
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:30,046
Okay, Professor.
We'll be in touch. You can go now.

215
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,840
Thank you.

216
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,100
Lieutenant, do those boys know
I want to see them?

217
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,268
Yes, they do.

218
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,312
Fine, let's go see the Dean.

219
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,740
What's up?

220
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,909
Nothing. I don't know,
I felt something.

221
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,744
This case is driving me crazy.

222
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,704
Me too.

223
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,540
I have the strange feeling
somebody is watching me.

224
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,419
I think it would be convenient
to have undercover agents here.

225
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,713
I'll tell the Dean
when we talk to him.

226
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,216
- Women, right?
- Yes, of course.

227
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,384
It's all the killer wants.

228
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,470
See you.

229
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,723
One moment, kid. You too.

230
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,852
The Lieutenant asked you to go
to the Dean's office in half an hour.

231
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,647
Okay. I'll make sure
he comes with me.

232
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,273
Don't worry, we'll be there.

233
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,236
I hope so, for your sake.
And don't say a word about this.

234
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,446
Yes, okay.

235
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,323
Yes, man. We know.

236
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:47,290
We're absolutely sure
that person is on campus.

237
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:51,169
You won't suspect
my students or my professors?

238
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,462
It could be anyone.

239
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,674
Do you want to cooperate or not?

240
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,344
You want to have
two policewomen here to spy on us.

241
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,721
That's asking too much.

242
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,182
There have been two murders.

243
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,893
And that maniac will kill again.

244
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,063
I assure you
it's the only way to catch him.

245
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,401
Yes. Okay.
Of course. I understand.

246
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,152
When do you want to start?

247
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,072
I will let you know.

248
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,866
Now I would like to ask
your secretary some questions.

249
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,243
And those two boys.

250
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,332
Hey, you don't need to say

251
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,294
you didn't find me the first time
you went to the library.

252
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,837
You know the police.

253
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,673
Do you think I'm stupid?
But, hey, where were you?

254
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,384
If you want to know, with Alice.
Do you know her?

255
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,886
The blonde one?
Don't tell me. Her too?

256
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,555
Sure, and without problems.

257
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,099
What a guy.
You have to give me your recipe.

258
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,350
If you behave.

259
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,769
Let's see,
if I understood correctly,

260
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,441
you found on your desk
a letter addressed to Kendall

261
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,609
that said "Urgent".

262
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,612
Yes. And I gave it
to the Dean right away.

263
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,740
Right, sir?

264
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,910
What did you do?

265
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,539
I'm sorry, but is this
really necessary, Lieutenant?

266
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:14,794
We could ask the parents
of the murdered girls, don't you think?

267
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,839
Yes, I understand.
It's natural.

268
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:22,010
You see,
I told Grace, my secretary,

269
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,888
to send the letter
to Kendall urgently.

270
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,975
Urgently? Why?

271
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,729
I don't allow my office
to be used as a post office.

272
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,942
Students know that and keep bothering
Grace with their foolishness.

273
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,403
Love letters and things like that.

274
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,573
Despite that,
when I found the letter on my desk,

275
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,368
l supposed
what the envelope said was truth.

276
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,494
"Very urgent".

277
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,037
I'm sorry, sir.

278
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,332
I never thought Jenny would use
your office for something like that.

279
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,501
You're wrong, boy.

280
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,798
It wasn't her.
That note was sent by the killer

281
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,758
to keep you away from the pool.

282
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,553
Why did you go?

283
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,891
I really don't know.

284
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,851
A hunch.

285
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,271
Something strange.

286
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:19,192
Something I couldn't explain,
Lieutenant.

287
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,780
Okay.

288
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,785
And you, do you know something?

289
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,996
Me? Not a word, I swear.

290
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,623
It's fine.

291
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:39,546
But don't say anything
about this conversation.

292
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,339
Understood?

293
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,675
Understood.

294
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,261
When you feel better, call me.

295
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,680
There's somebody
I'd like you to talk to.

296
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,766
- Okay.
- I have no more questions. Do you?

297
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:39,606
One, two, three, four.

298
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,984
One, two, three, four.

299
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:47,071
And one, two, three, four,

300
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,492
five, six, seven, eight.

301
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:54,162
And one, two, three, four,

302
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,499
five, six, seven, eight.

303
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,628
One, two, three, four,

304
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,256
five, six, seven, eight.

305
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,259
One, two, three.

306
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,971
Okay.

307
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,765
- I'll go out a moment.
- Okay.

308
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,825
What's up?

309
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,785
You scared me to death.

310
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,914
- You were so sudden.
- Come. I want to tell you something.

311
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,500
Come in.

312
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,670
Hello, doctor.

313
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,172
How many times have I told you
not to call me that?

314
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,341
I'm a psychologist,
not a doctor in medicine.

315
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,010
Is this the boy?

316
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,137
Hey, I don't need a shrink.

317
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,680
Come here.

318
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,057
I'm not a shrink, young man.

319
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,852
And I'm sure
you don't need me.

320
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,397
Don't worry.
What the doctor wants is information.

321
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,107
About what?

322
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,527
My name is Jennings.
I'm a psychologist, as you've heard.

323
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:55,074
My job is to make
a detailed psychological profile

324
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,534
of the possible murderer.

325
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:01,789
In many cases, the profile
is all we have to start with.

326
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,293
But I don't know anything.

327
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,544
Or do I?

328
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,089
Exactly. Maybe you know
the murderer and don't know it.

329
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,802
Now, if the Lieutenant is so kind
to go back to his job,

330
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,846
we'll try to figure it out.

331
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,890
Okay.

332
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,558
I'll see you later.

333
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,684
Bye.

334
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,561
Have a seat.

335
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,150
Is it dangerous?

336
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,153
Very much.

337
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:36,616
Better. I'm sick of getting bored
in this damn office.

338
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,243
I supposed so.

339
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,622
You find an active girl,
put her to fill out paperwork,

340
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,833
and six months later,
she'll volunteer for anything.

341
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,585
Dr. Jennings is done with me.

342
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,837
Well, it wasn't so serious, was it?

343
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,756
Hey, aren't you Mary Riggs?

344
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,967
Herself.
Mary Riggs, Kendall James.

345
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,054
Pleased to meet you.
I've watched almost all your games.

346
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,473
But why is
a tennis champion here?

347
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,475
Simple,
this is my home.

348
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,478
Do you mean you work here?

349
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,021
Of course.

350
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,065
She's the lady I told you about.

351
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,651
She'll work undercover
in campus.

352
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,820
She'll be the new tennis instructor.

353
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,405
That's great.

354
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,741
I really appreciate you trusting me
like this, Lieutenant.

355
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,618
And you too, of course.

356
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:28,334
Kendall, all you have to do
is keep your eyes open

357
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,838
and be always near Miss Riggs
in case she needs help.

358
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,131
- Okay?
- Okay.

359
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,020
He's a good boy
and he's had a rough time.

360
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,941
We've talked seriously
and I think we can trust him.

361
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,653
I think that's fine.
But why did you tell him about me?

362
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,531
We're at a dead end.

363
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,826
And I don't have anyone
to go there with you.

364
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,371
I trust him.

365
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,165
I'd put my life in his hands.

366
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,791
And mine, too, of course.

367
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:13,713
I don't know why you complain.
You'll be playing tennis all clay.

368
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,798
You'll play tennis
until you're bored.

369
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,719
- And we'll be watching...
- I need to talk to the Lieutenant now.

370
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,888
I'm really sorry,
but it's not possible.

371
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,931
It's orders, you'll understand.

372
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,808
- I can't...
- I've been calling all morning.

373
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,144
Let her.

374
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,270
What's up?

375
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,565
I was waiting for you, Lieutenant.
Do you have a minute?

376
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,442
Who are you? It's okay.

377
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,444
Sylvia Costa, Boston Globe.

378
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,946
What's going on
at the university?

379
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,241
What's going
at the university?

380
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,368
I don't know
what could be going on.

381
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,829
There are rumors,
strange things are happening.

382
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,291
It seems there's a maniac.
Or something like that.

383
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,754
Madam, rumors like that
spread every day at the university.

384
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,964
Yes, but this time it seems it's true.

385
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,426
There's even rumors
about a murdered girl.

386
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,639
The imagination
of the students is wild.

387
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,391
I'm sorry, but I'm very busy now.
Would you excuse me?

388
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,935
But...

389
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,897
Why don't you talk to Miss Riggs?

390
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,274
She's the one up-to-date
on those things.

391
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,346
40-15.

392
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:22,341
Game for Miss Riggs.

393
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,540
Very well, Miss Riggs.
You've been great. Great.

394
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,167
Thank you.

395
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,837
There's tea at the professor's lounge.
I'm sure you need it.

396
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,215
Yes, but I'd like a shower first.
That girl made me sweat.

397
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,260
Please, Miss Riggs.
Don't be modest.

398
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,848
I'm sure with your lessons,
our tennis team will improve greatly.

399
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,853
Tell me, does anyone suspect?
Does anyone know why I'm here?

400
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,732
Nobody except those
who the Lieutenant told.

401
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,817
Fine, then you're the only one.

402
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,528
I'd like to talk to you
some other time. Could I?

403
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,696
Yes, of course.

404
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,367
But what about the other woman?
I don't see her anywhere.

405
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,619
Well, you'll see,
I came alone.

406
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,080
These jobs are for volunteers.

407
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,708
You are brave, Miss Riggs.

408
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,797
I just hope you can do your job
efficiently, but discreetly.

409
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,549
This is very important.

410
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,970
By the way, where's Willard?

411
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:54,725
We had to set him free.
We don't have evidence yet.

412
00:39:56,352 --> 00:40:00,356
Please, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Could I talk to you for a moment?

413
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,276
I'm afraid I can't right now, Miss.
I'm busy. I'm sorry.

414
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,028
It's very important.

415
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,571
What is this about?

416
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:11,117
It's about what's been going on lately.

417
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,536
I don't know
what you're talking about.

418
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,329
Tell me what's been going on.

419
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,624
- Do you know?
- I don't know anything at all.

420
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,003
Nothing strange
is going on here, right, dear?

421
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,213
Excuse us, we're in a hurry.

422
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,779
Who's over there?

423
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,761
Oh. It's you. You scared me.

424
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,008
What's this?

425
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,052
What are you doing?

426
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,890
No!

427
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,279
- The key, where's the damn key?
- We don't have a key.

428
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,698
I'll go through the window
and open the door.

429
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,051
Come.

430
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,022
Hurry up.

431
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,117
No.

432
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,372
Find help, quickly.
Use the phone there.

433
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,541
If the door is closed,
knock it down.

434
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,169
Damn bastard.

435
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,822
- What's happened?
- That bastard cut a girl's arms.

436
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,950
We haven't been able
to catch him.

437
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,910
Calm down.
This time, we'll get him.

438
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:56,748
Sergeant, make sure every inch
of the building is searched.

439
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,376
- I will, sir.
- Every inch, is it clear?

440
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,961
Don't worry.

441
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:09,803
Doctor, how's the girl?

442
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,140
It's hard to tell. She's still alive,
but she's lost a lot of blood.

443
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,976
It's very serious.
I don't think she'll survive.

444
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,145
God.

445
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,148
That bastard
must be laughing at us.

446
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,067
What's happened?

447
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,777
Where did you come from?

448
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,404
What?

449
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,157
Are you deaf? I asked you
where are you coming from.

450
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,575
Upstairs, the library.

451
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,118
Fine.

452
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,745
We'll talk later.

453
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,788
Kendall.

454
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,265
Dean,
something terrible happened.

455
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,893
Listen, kid,
I'm sending patrols everywhere,

456
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,561
but it's not enough.

457
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,856
I want you to keep
your eyes and ears open.

458
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,691
I need your help.

459
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:08,362
And I especially want you
to closely watch Miss Riggs.

460
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,280
I shouldn't ask you this,

461
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:16,078
but I can't afford having
this crazy bastard run away again.

462
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,746
Go now.

463
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,334
Randall, I want you
to investigate the whole staff.

464
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,586
Thoroughly.

465
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,673
Use the whole department
if you have to.

466
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,591
Very well, Lieutenant.

467
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:34,846
I imagined you'd like that.
Try to do it the best you can.

468
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,140
I don't think
he'll take long to kill again.

469
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,737
Shut up. Don't you see?

470
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,823
You'll wake up all campus.

471
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,492
And you were afraid
we'd get caught?

472
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,369
What a story.

473
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,246
Oh, Kendall.

474
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,416
Does every woman
always have to end up crying?

475
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,959
Come on, leave me alone.

476
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:25,606
You're all the same. When you get
what you want, you ditch us.

477
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,744
What are you doing?

478
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,662
Are you leaving now?

479
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,000
Kendall.

480
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,785
- Miss Riggs.
- It's you.

481
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,997
- Miss Riggs.
- You scared me to death.

482
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,248
What's happened here?

483
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,793
I don't know. I thought I saw
somebody running in the garden.

484
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,004
I went out to see who it was.

485
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,673
Then he attacked me.

486
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,216
And there he is.

487
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,014
But it's my kung-fu instructor.
What are you doing here?

488
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:07,392
Well, I was doing footing,
and all of a sudden, I was attacked.

489
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,978
But I see it was nothing.
Good night.

490
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,354
- Bye.
- Bye.

491
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,108
What are you doing here so late?

492
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,902
Lieutenant asked me to watch you.

493
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,238
I saw you go out,
but when I went down you were gone.

494
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,782
So I got my bike.

495
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,201
Next time, forget the bike.

496
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:25,911
It sounds just like a saw.

497
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,663
Since you are okay, I'll leave. Bye.

498
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,874
No way, Kendall. No.

499
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,752
Let me get my gun
and I'm leaving with you.

500
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,295
Okay.

501
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:42,969
Hop up.

502
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,556
Hold on.

503
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,152
Well, thank you.

504
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,780
For saving my life tonight.

505
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,869
See you tomorrow, okay?

506
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,829
Mary.

507
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,500
One drink?

508
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,047
Some other time.

509
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:31,925
Thank you.

510
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,939
Casanova.

511
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,262
You?

512
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,886
Willard.

513
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,932
Who put on that music?
It's unbearable.

514
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,683
They must be testing it.

515
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,478
I thought that was your job.

516
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,606
No, Miss.
I only take care of the garden.

517
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,609
The loudspeakers
are controlled from the Dean's office.

518
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,864
Kendall, call and ask
if there's somebody testing them.

519
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,201
There's a phone in the lockers
if Willard can get the key.

520
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,371
It's forbidden to use that phone.

521
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,331
I'll take responsibility.

522
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,754
Wait here.

523
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,101
How do you stop that?

524
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,310
I don't know.

525
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,771
That damn music
is driving me crazy.

526
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:25,027
Is there any way
to turn that music off?

527
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,988
I'll try. Come with me.

528
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,448
Let's go.

529
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:45,715
And that key?

530
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:52,889
Don't touch it.
It could be evidence.

531
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:54,891
If something's happened, I mean.

532
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,245
Kendall?

533
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,331
Kendall?

534
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,043
Kendall!

535
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,464
Kendall, where are you?

536
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,763
What's happened?

537
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:38,184
Another one. In there.
It's Suzy Billing.

538
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,372
Yes.

539
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:02,458
While we were distracted
with that music,

540
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,461
that bastard was killing her!

541
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,464
Animal!

542
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:11,467
Animal!

543
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,804
Animal!

544
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,558
He cut her in half
while she was still alive.

545
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,227
Do you imagine
how much she must have suffered?

546
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,479
Sergeant,
we're running out of time.

547
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:27,024
I know, Lieutenant, I know.
I'm doing my best.

548
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:30,653
But if I go too fast,
I could miss something important.

549
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,238
I need more time.

550
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,115
That's what we don't have,
Sergeant.

551
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:39,745
Make an effort, don't sleep,
but give me something.

552
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:43,791
Lieutenant, I'm doing my best,
but I'd like some help.

553
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,960
I can't be up all night.

554
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,254
My eyes are so tired
I can't read anything.

555
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:51,507
I think I can get you some help.

556
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:52,967
Do you remember Kendall?

557
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,678
That kid could be useful.

558
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,847
Are you kidding?

559
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,807
We can't use a suspect for this.

560
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,268
Don't be foolish.

561
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,645
That kid knows people well.

562
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,480
He's been five years in university

563
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:10,943
and he could detect any abnormality
sooner than any of us.

564
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,655
Yes, Lieutenant, I know.
But the rules...

565
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:17,199
The rules can go to hell.

566
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:20,620
We need to find the killer.
That's what the rules say.

567
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:23,289
So in half an hour,
Kendall will be there.

568
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:53,778
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll fix it.

569
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,001
Professor. Professor Brown.

570
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:10,211
Professor.

571
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,422
Do you mind if I go with you?

572
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,966
I'm a little jumpy
after what's happened.

573
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,970
In broad daylight, I don't think
there's much to be afraid of.

574
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,598
I'm going to the Horton building.
ls it convenient for you?

575
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:23,766
Yes, sure.

576
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,644
I'm sorry.
You must think I'm foolish.

577
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,690
- But after what I saw...
- No, not at all.

578
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:35,736
I'm too used to seeing dead bodies,
I might be desensitized.

579
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,700
Contrary to the Dean,
you look like a sensitive man.

580
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:44,412
I think you are not familiar with campus politics.

581
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:45,788
Why do you say that?

582
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,125
To survive in a campus like this,
you have to be very tough.

583
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:52,211
I wouldn't put obstacles
in the Dean's way.

584
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,214
I'm sure I wouldn't do well.

585
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,925
It looks like
you have experience.

586
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,301
Bitter experience.

587
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,971
I call it as I see it.

588
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:06,600
- Tell me more.
- There's nothing more, Miss Riggs.

589
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:11,230
I don't like people who try
to meddle in other people's lives.

590
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,858
I just want to know
where I am, Professor.

591
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,277
Especially if there's
a maniac going around.

592
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,911
- It's me.
- I'm sorry.

593
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:29,665
Sorry. I'm a little jumpy,
that's all. Where have you been?

594
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:34,545
Lieutenant asked me
to help Sgt. Holden to check the files.

595
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,715
Wow, the Lieutenant
is pretty unorthodox.

596
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,175
Well.

597
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,677
Do you know
where I can find the Dean?

598
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,554
He won't be back
until this afternoon.

599
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,848
He goes to Arlington
every first of the month.

600
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:49,185
You'll find him in his residence
around 7:00.

601
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:52,271
At 7:00?
Okay, I'll see him then.

602
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:53,481
As you wish.

603
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:56,275
- See you soon. Bye.
- Yes. Bye.

604
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:11,499
Hello.
Where do we start today?

605
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,834
Our police apprentice.

606
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:18,839
I hope you still like this job
after ten hours looking at papers.

607
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,591
You don't smoke, do you?

608
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,510
No. Why, does it bother you?

609
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:26,931
Yes, I can't stand smoke,
especially down here.

610
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,641
Well, you know how it goes.

611
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,518
Read carefully every report

612
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,896
and take down any notes
about any university member.

613
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,272
Okay?

614
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,690
That's your desk.

615
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,359
Okay.

616
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:40,963
Well, Miss Riggs,
what a surprise.

617
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,215
Excuse me,
I don't want to bother you.

618
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:44,550
Come in, please.

619
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:48,429
I just wanted to ask you
some questions.

620
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:54,476
Perfect. If you insist in staying here,
we'll just have to get comfortable.

621
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,770
It's ridiculous, don't you think?

622
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,285
This way.

623
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:17,917
Would you like something to drink?

624
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:21,921
I was making tea,
but maybe you'd like coffee.

625
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:23,464
Yes, coffee, please.

626
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,299
Your apartment is beautiful.

627
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:29,678
Thank you. You're kind.
I don't hear that often.

628
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,932
This is too big just for me.

629
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:34,558
Make yourself comfortable, dear.

630
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,228
One moment, please.

631
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:47,905
Miss Riggs,
how do you like your coffee?

632
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,157
With milk and sugar?

633
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,576
Milk and no sugar.

634
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,620
Maybe some saccharine.

635
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,041
I see you watch your diet.

636
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,086
I didn't think you'd have to,
playing tennis.

637
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,382
I'll put in a little.

638
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,408
One moment.

639
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:51,635
Here I am, dear.
I'm sorry I took so long.

640
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,555
Here's your coffee.

641
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,891
I don't know if you'll like it.
It's instant.

642
01:13:58,183 --> 01:13:59,059
Thank you.

643
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:02,146
I put in some saccharine,
as you asked.

644
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:07,985
It tastes great. It's fabulous.

645
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,905
You're too kind,
but I'm glad you like it.

646
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:15,784
Now, Miss Riggs, tell me,
what did you want to talk about?

647
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,622
Professor Brown.

648
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:24,585
Professor Brown.

649
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:30,507
Yes. Do you know if he has problems,
something he wants to hide?

650
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,638
I hate asking questions like this.

651
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,058
But it's absolutely necessary.

652
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,644
Would you like some more coffee?

653
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:45,022
Yes.

654
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,484
It was very good.

655
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:06,126
I think that if we don't find
something soon,

656
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,879
each member of the campus
will be investigated.

657
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:17,679
Frankly, I wouldn't like
to see the university

658
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:20,474
full of officers
looking for bodies everywhere.

659
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,728
It would be pretty annoying.

660
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:32,861
Sergeant,
this seems important.

661
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,284
He's changed his name.

662
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:41,787
It's not much,
but we should look into it.

663
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,747
I'll check out the files in Arlington.

664
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,834
I hope there's someone there,
it's a little late.

665
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:03,350
Arlington?

666
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:04,893
Sergeant Holden
from Boston.

667
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:08,939
I want an expansion
on report number 672947HF.

668
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,024
It's urgent.

669
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:12,317
Yes, I'll hold.

670
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,784
You'd better keep working.
This will take some time.

671
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:24,621
I'm talking to an old man
who sounds like he's about to die.

672
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:26,999
I'm listening. Tell me.

673
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,918
Yes.

674
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,962
Are you sure?

675
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,177
Could you telex that to me right now?

676
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,637
To our central office.
It's really urgent.

677
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:47,186
Yes, I understand.
That's it. Thank you.

678
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:53,400
What did he say?

679
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:58,655
We got it. I'm sure
the Dean is the killer.

680
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:02,868
Apparently, his mother
was dismembered when he was little.

681
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,912
That must have made him
lose his mind.

682
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,289
I imagined it had to be
something like this.

683
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:11,210
Mary. She said she'd go see
the Dean at 7:00.

684
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:13,462
God. Why didn't you say so?
Let's go.

685
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,672
No, you stay here
and call Lieutenant immediately.

686
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,175
What am I saying?
No, there's no time to spare.

687
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,469
We'll use the radio in the car.
Let's go.

688
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,346
I hope we make it in time.

689
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:33,440
Sorry. The water was cold
and I had to heat it up again.

690
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:34,858
- Thank you.
- Your coffee.

691
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:39,488
We were talking
about Professor Brown.

692
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:46,787
He's a homosexual.
I found out by chance a few years ago.

693
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,957
But so far, he hasn't broken
any rules.

694
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:52,501
And, therefore, it's his business.

695
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:55,462
Don't you think, dear?

696
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:06,598
Brown was very worried
I found out his secret,

697
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:09,017
and he tried to destroy me.

698
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,854
But I'm stronger than him.

699
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,360
I don't feel well.

700
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:24,324
I feel something strange.

701
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,128
You're feeling the effect
of the drug I gave you.

702
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:41,800
You can see and hear
everything I tell you, right?

703
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:45,220
But you can't move, right?

704
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,278
Lieutenant.

705
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,904
- Lieutenant.
- What's up?

706
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,074
An urgent telex for you.
It's about the university murders.

707
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,413
It looks like they've found the killer.

708
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:15,917
Tell Roger to get my car. Fast.

709
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,890
Nobody will ever find her. Ever.

710
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:46,031
Sergeant.

711
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:50,952
One moment.

712
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:54,164
You go from behind the building.
Let's go.

713
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,349
That way.

714
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,281
Kendall, stay here
and don't move.

715
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:30,951
Lieutenant,
you can't do this to me now.

716
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:34,830
Okay, but go behind.

717
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,874
If somebody yells "floor",
I want you kissing it like a soldier.

718
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:39,042
Yes, sir.

719
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:47,384
Move.

720
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,305
Still.

721
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,027
Mary.

722
01:21:09,322 --> 01:21:10,532
Mary.

723
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,453
Mary.

724
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:19,332
What's wrong with you?
Mary, what did he do to you?

725
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,382
The Dean isn't here.

726
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:29,676
We've got to find him.
He can't be far.

727
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:32,637
Kendall, stay with her.

728
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,973
I'll ask for an ambulance
in the radio.

729
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:39,394
Come on, Mary.

730
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:41,021
Mary.

731
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:46,276
Mary, please.
You have to stand up.

732
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:49,112
Move. Stand up.

733
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:52,282
Please. Come on, up.

734
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,867
Let's go.

735
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,662
It's all over. Please.

736
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:01,917
Come on. I'll help you.

737
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:04,628
Come on.

738
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,047
Very well, Mary.

739
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:10,717
You have to walk now.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

740
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:14,804
Now you have to walk a little.

741
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:18,767
That's right. Very well.

742
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:22,604
Come on.

743
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,794
- Are you okay, kid?
- Yes. Yes.

744
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:32,299
- You were lucky.
- I can see that.

745
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,175
How's Mary?

746
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:37,262
She'll be fine soon.
She's been drugged.

747
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,640
Get something to cover him.

748
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:47,314
Sergeant,
let's search everything.

749
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,781
- Hey, look at this.
- Let's see.

750
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,115
It's awful, isn't it?

751
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:43,495
I wouldn't say so.
It's not so bad.

752
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:48,458
I never thought the Dean
would collect things like this.

753
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:52,295
Kendall, as you see,
you learn something new every clay.

754
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:21,324
Let's go, fast.
And the Lieutenant?

755
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:22,701
He left with Miss Riggs.

756
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:23,993
Fine, you can go.

757
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,580
How are you?

758
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,040
I'm fine.

759
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:30,834
Still want to be a police officer?

760
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,753
- Are you kidding?
- Come on, I'll buy you some coffee.

761
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:41,553
You can rest assured,
you've helped avenge them.

762
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,221
- Let's go.
- One moment.
