- That's not my neighbourhood.

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,955
Oh, yeah. There's a pool hall up there.
That's your main place.

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,799
Excuse me. Excuse me,
can I get my check?

32
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,071
Hey, Charlie, check for
the gentleman in the front.

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,994
- Enjoy it? Here's the check.
- Thank you, Dottie.

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,715
Hey, whaddaya say, Frenchy!
How are you, my friend?

35
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,678
Hey, you! Hey! Hey!

36
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,031
- Hey, you didn't pay for your lunch.
- What?

37
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,755
- You didn't pay your bill, big boy.
- Oh, sure I paid. Didn't I?

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,030
The check's in your pocket.

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,872
Oh.

40
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,756
You're right.
OK, let me take care of that right now.

41
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,872
I'm sorry. I don't know
how this happened. It's just I...

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,755
It's just... I got a lot of things on my mind,
business things, and I simply forgot.

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,189
You deliberately walked out
without paying.

44
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,439
I did not. Here, come on. Just take
the money and keep the change and...

45
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,710
Fine. Maybe you'd like to tell a cop.

46
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,195
No! No, no... don't... no, don't.

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,513
Let me guess.
Sometimes you don't pay for your lunch.

48
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,395
Or maybe you steal the occasional
candy bar, or newspaper.

49
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,036
You're a closet rebel.

50
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,952
Oh, that's my telepager.
I gotta call the office.

51
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,399
Which way are you goin'?
I'll give you a ride.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,037
Well, don't you... don't you
have to go back to work?

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,392
I don't work there.

54
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,714
W- wait, wait, wait. What's all this
business about the, uh... check?

55
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,036
Are you coming?

56
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,558
Uh, well, I, uh... all right.
It's just I gotta go by the bank. And then...

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,479
- Thank you.
- Wanna die young?

58
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,035
I gotta go by the bank,
then down to the office.

59
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,196
- I'll drop you off.
- It's downtown.

60
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,276
It's on my way.

61
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,758
Ready or not, babe?

62
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,269
You think that was pretty funny,
don't you? The way you...

63
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,349
The way you had me goin' back there.

64
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,276
- It was all right. I'm Lulu.
- Charles. Pleased to meet you.

65
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,756
Whoa!

66
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,714
-  Ooh, yikes!
- That was...

67
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,035
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are we goin'?

68
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,912
- I know a short cut.
- Oh, good.

69
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,395
Oh, crap.

70
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,476
- Let me see.
- Oh. It's the...

71
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,598
Hey, that's... Uh, wait.
This is the Holland Tunnel. This is wrong.

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,359
- Are you listening to me? Go back.
- Charlie...

73
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,232
What are you doing?

74
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,352
You're crazy.
You really know that? Oh, God!

75
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,278
I gotta go to work.
I got meetings, a million calls...

76
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,995
Hey, relax, Charlie. Come on.

77
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,429
Take the afternoon off.

78
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,994
You deserve it. Really.

79
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,750
I can't just take the afternoon off.
What, are you n... nuts?

80
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,159
All right, look, you turn around when we
get out of the tunnel. Let's just go back.

81
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,236
- This isn't funny.
- Want a drink?

82
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,711
No, don't! God, don't drink!
Please, this is dangerous.

83
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,796
Don't do that. God, don't.

84
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,956
Look, if you don't turn around
and take me back,

85
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,038
you're gonna make me do something
that I don't wanna do.

86
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,556
I can hardly wait, Charlie.

87
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,509
- Nice ring you got there, Charlie.
- Thank you.

88
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,029
You been married a long time?

89
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,515
Just tell me where we're going, all right?

90
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,633
- How many kids do you have, Charlie?
- That's not your concern.

91
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,955
Come on! Let's see the pictures.

92
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,799
What makes you think
I got pictures of my kids?

93
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,673
- Are you afraid of me, Charlie?
- I'm not afraid of you.

94
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,360
- Let me see 'em.
- All right, if you want to.

95
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,672
Right there.

96
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,189
Very nice, Charlie. I'm impressed.

97
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,436
Thank you.

98
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,716
"Charles Driggs. Regional Manager."

99
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,595
They just made me vice president.
I start Monday, as a matter of fact.

100
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,676
Oh, yeah? Vice president?

101
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,995
Oh, well. Here's to you, Mr Vice President.

102
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,873
- Want some?
- No, no.

103
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,836
Come on, Charlie.
Come on! It's OK.

104
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,311
- No, thank you very much.
- Be a sport, Charlie.

105
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,113
All right, what the heck. Give me it.

106
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,553
- I wanna get another bottle.
- OK, I'm gonna phone my secretary.

107
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,752
Hi. I need four pints
of some Scotch, please.

108
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,834
Hey, babe, you work here or what?

109
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,916
- Four?
- Yeah.

110
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,675
Why, of course.

111
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,156
Hi, pooch.

112
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,639
Two.

113
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,671
Stocks acquired before one January '84

114
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,920
should not be subject to anti-straddle
rules, however long they may be held.

115
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,715
I hope none of the above causes
any undue concern. Charles S Driggs.

116
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,156
Thank you very much.

117
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,630
Is that Glenlivet up there?

118
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,436
It is Glenlivet, isn't it?

119
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,951
I gotta have a bottle. I'm sorry to make
you get up there, but it's my favourite.

120
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,036
- Of course.
- Thank you.

121
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,357
The reason that I like Scotch so much
is because my family's Scottish.

122
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,993
My mother's mother was an O'Connor.

123
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,429
Oh, really? How bloody interesting.

124
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,516
That makes me, like, a quarter Scottish.

125
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,395
My father's mother, she was a Hawthorne.

126
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,596
I've just about got it.

127
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,920
Little Willy was conceived on our trip
to Scotland a number of years ago...

128
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,874
Oh, crap. See if you can get me out
of that five o'clock squash with Graves.

129
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,353
Tell him... Lynn?

130
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,630
That was the office, for Christ's...

131
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,516
Coming?

132
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,919
There's a tax act in the works that
would authorise regulations to be written

133
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,715
amplifying what is meant
by "substantial reduction".

134
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,796
What?

135
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,750
Charlie, what do you do for fun
besides steal candy bars? Huh?

136
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,792
You were right. I'm a rebel.

137
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,552
I am! I just channelled my rebellion into
the mainstream. I'll give you an example.

138
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,478
In '81, I went long-term munis.

139
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,194
Everybody said
"Driggs, you're crazy, don't do it."

140
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,515
- Munis?
- Municipal bonds. Tax-free.

141
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,200
Hell, I was locking in close to 15.

142
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,188
I may look straight,
but deep down, I got what it takes.

143
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,476
Do you?

144
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,155
- What's this?
- Getting a room.

145
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,475
Something wrong, Charlie?

146
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,310
Maybe it's not such a good idea,
getting a room.

147
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,558
- Don't you have someplace we could go?
- How about your place?

148
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,229
I can just see the neighbours
watching you get out of the car.

149
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,835
You have money?

150
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,638
I mean, for the room.
The rest is free.

151
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,431
Well...

152
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,312
Let me check.

153
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,111
I only got these credit cards -
which are company plastic.

154
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,472
Our accountant would wonder what I was
doing in a motel on a Friday afternoon.

155
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,797
- Use the cash.
- No, I can't use that.

156
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,230
- Why?
- That's money for the Christmas Club.

157
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,558
Are we not gonna get a room

158
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,470
because you're saving for Christmas
presents? In the middle of June?

159
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,234
It's not bad. I've stayed in worse.
Not much of a view, though.

160
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,109
I want you to know that I've, uh...
never done anything like this before.

161
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,117
Don't worry, Charlie. I have.

162
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,914
I wanna leave the T-shirt on, OK?

163
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,953
- Why's that?
- I don't know. I don't feel comfortable yet.

164
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,196
Oh, gosh.

165
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,590
- How do you feel now, Charlie?
- Good.

166
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,312
Want some?

167
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,510
Yeah. Thank you.

168
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,714
Can I help you find anything?

169
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,671
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

170
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,556
Ch-Ch-Charlie.

171
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,836
You game?

172
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,476
You're a funny girl.

173
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,273
Yeah...

174
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,757
Oh, God! That's... That's a new T-shirt!

175
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,557
Oh, Jesus...

176
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,639
Charlie, you must not
be getting enough at home.

177
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,990
- Mm, you look good enough to eat.
- Oh, thank you.

178
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,593
Oh, God...

179
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,517
What are you doing?

180
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,716
Making a call...

181
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,949
Yeah, operator. 2127-247-270.

182
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,954
No! Don't!

183
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,036
God! Oh, God!

184
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,112
Charles Driggs' office.

185
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,880
- Is Charlie there, please?
- No!

186
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,911
He's not? It's 3.30. Shouldn't he be back
from lunch by now?

187
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,712
Oh, please don't!

188
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,638
Who is this, please?
I can take a message for Mr Driggs.

189
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,792
No, this is a matter
of considerable urgency.

190
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,679
Please connect me to his superior.

191
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,916
Good afternoon, Richard Graves' office.

192
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,439
Yes, Mr Richard Graves, please.
Mr Charles Driggs is calling.

193
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,711
Yes?

194
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,713
Richard, Charles Driggs here.
Yeah, listen...

195
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,072
Yeah, no, just calling to let you know
that I won't be back this afternoon.

196
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,316
You won't be back? Is something wrong?

197
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,592
No, no problem. I'm just stuck in outside
meetings. You know how that goes.

198
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,950
I'd hoped we'd be able to huddle today.

199
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,116
Oh, sorry about that.

200
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,278
Well, no, I was just gonna
throw that to Dillman.

201
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,599
Yeah.

202
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,438
Yeah, I'm writing this down.

203
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,790
Oh, Charlie. Oh, Charlie...

204
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,196
How about I have copies on your desk
first thing Monday?

205
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,550
Wouldn't that... Yeah, all right, sure.

206
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,954
Goodbye.

207
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,434
Oooh!

208
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,439
Charlie, you're a really good liar
when you wanna be.

209
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,516
Oh, jeez! Don't stop, please.

210
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,315
<i>Both her arms were covered with rings</i>
<i>and jewellery...</i>

211
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,910
<i>Accoutrements of black, Satanistic...</i>
<i>Please, I'm on TV.</i>

212
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,316
<i>- And you say she was armed?</i>
<i>- Definitely armed.</i>

213
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,000
<i>It looked like a 9 millimetre or a.38 to me.</i>

214
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,996
Oh, God, what time is it?

215
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,270
Time to get the hell outta Dodge.

216
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,359
- If you wanna take a shower, hurry.
- Why? We leave now, we hit traffic.

217
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,675
I'm not going back.
You have to take a bus.

218
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,315
- Why, where are you going?
- Pennsylvania, back to where I grew up.

219
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,398
Oh, really?
It's hard to imagine you growing up.

220
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,554
What, you think I was born like this?

221
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,915
Yeah, I'm writing this down!

222
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,235
"He should be back. It's 3.30!"

223
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,636
Hi, honey. I know it's short notice,
but I've been called away on business.

224
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,194
I've got a meeting tonight in Philadelphia.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?

225
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,915
So, I should be home tomorrow evening.
For sure.

226
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,994
Or maybe tomorrow morning.
Could be even later tonight.

227
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,715
Depending on, you know... Depending.

228
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,956
So, love you too, and goodbye.

229
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,388
Sure you know what you're doing?

230
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,114
No. But what the hell, you know?

231
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,316
Mom & Dad's. Dad speaking.

232
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,595
...Mickey Lolich pitching to a Babe Ruth
with Tony Lazzeri on second base...

233
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,359
Thanks, Rose.
...whether you put Mickey Stanley...

234
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,074
What? What's so funny?

235
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,270
- You.
- What? What'd I do?

236
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,630
Calling the waitress by her name.

237
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,910
That's what name tags are for.

238
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,349
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rose.

239
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,990
Just makes things a little friendlier,
a little more personal. I like that.

240
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,509
- Yeah. Charlie Driggs.
- Yeah.

241
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,956
What do we got?

242
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,834
Oh, my gosh. I don't believe this.

243
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,599
I have got $4 left from the Christmas Club
money. I don't be...

244
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,234
I'll get it, Charlie. You got the room.

245
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,633
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

246
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,716
I'll be right back.

247
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,034
I like you, Charlie.
You're a really nice guy.

248
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,316
Maybe a little too nice.

249
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,155
No, I'm sorry, we don't have a thing
available until after 7.15.

250
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,838
Yeah, that's OK.

251
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,237
- Goodnight, Rose.
- The young woman said you'd get this.

252
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,874
- She didn't pay for this?
- No, sir.

253
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,316
Lulu?

254
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,714
She said the gentleman
would pay for dinner.

255
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,634
You...

256
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,716
The gentleman would...

257
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
This is absolutely unbelievable. Uh...

258
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,554
Well, that's no problem, Rose.
I'll take care of that lickety-split.

259
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,038
Sorry. The, uh, credit cards.
How about that?

260
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,435
We don't accept any credit cards.

261
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,670
<i>Any</i> credit cards.

262
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,877
Problem, Dad?

263
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,276
Possible cash-flow problem.

264
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,552
No, there's no problem at all.
I don't think that there...

265
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,797
...there's anything to worry about.
Come on, fellas.

266
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,913
I mean, do I look like a guy who'd run out
on a check? I mean, come on!

267
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,077
You guys!

268
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,475
Come on, Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

269
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,834
What are you doing?!
I could've been killed!

270
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,315
You know you don't like
paying those things.

271
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,591
I still got the old wheels, don't I?
Did you see me?

272
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,109
You're pretty quick for an old guy.

273
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,953
The guy didn't get the license number,
did he?

274
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,798
Oh, Charlie.

275
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,036
# Wild thing

276
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,556
# You make my heart sing

277
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,996
# You make everything

278
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,396
# Groovy

279
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,356
# Wild thing

280
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,151
# Wild thing, I think I love you

281
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,192
# But I wanna know for sure

282
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,520
# Come on and hold me tight

283
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,951
- Where, Charlie? Here?
- 30 feet, 20 feet...

284
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,799
We're almost... You missed it.

285
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,353
Careful, careful!

286
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,994
Fine, all right. Just park it. Fine.

287
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,953
Park it. Lock it. Let's go.
Just leave it here.

288
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,799
- Charlie, where are you?
- Ow. I'm all right.

289
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,876
You all right?

290
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,679
- Save the burgers.
- The hamburgers. Charlie!

291
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,712
Where'd you go?
Watch out, there's a small cliff...

292
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,310
- I'll fix you up.
- Anything. It's killin' me.

293
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,317
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

294
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,312
Hey, listen, you knock one over the fence
for your old man, all right? OK.

295
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,396
Tell Scott I love him.

296
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,916
OK. Great. Good. Bye.

297
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,230
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

298
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,756
Take half of it now, half of it later
and you'll feel a lot better. There ya go.

299
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,236
Remember, it's better to be a live dog
than a dead lion.

300
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,874
I've felt the same way before.

301
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,195
- Good luck to you.
- Yeah, thank you.

302
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,556
Lulu?

303
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,436
Lulu?

304
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,120
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- What? Come here.

305
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,152
- What's that?
- Uh... well, it's, you know...

306
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,273
It took a while, but the whisky
caught up with me, I guess.

307
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,916
How can you drink that stuff?

308
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,153
I have to. My head's killing me.
I haven't had hard liquor in years.

309
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,831
Hair of the dog that bit you, babe.

310
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,550
God, no, no! Jesus, don't drink that!
No. I'm serious.

311
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,434
- You drank enough of it last night.
- Last night was last night.

312
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,437
- Here. Have some of this.
- No.

313
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,278
No, don't tell me no, please.

314
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,313
- This is better for you. It's tried and true.
- I don't want any of it.

315
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,351
- Do you have a hangover?
- Yes.

316
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,996
Then this is the stuff you drink
for a hangover. Come on. Drink it, please.

317
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,036
- No.
- Please.

318
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,876
- No.
- Please!

319
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,956
- No!
- Drink it!

320
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,036
Thank you.

321
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,831
Shit!

322
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,396
The guy at the restaurant
must have got the license number.

323
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,875
- Is this your car, pal?
- Huh?

324
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,673
I've been admiring your bike.

325
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,950
You interested in motorcycles?

326
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,517
No, I just like big things between my legs.

327
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,596
Thank you, officer.

328
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,596
Damn, I left my suitcase in the car.

329
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,392
I cannot afford to get mixed up
in things like this! I got responsibilities!

330
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,592
Don't worry about the car.
It's gonna be fine.

331
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,599
Oh, well, I am worried.
Let's just don't blow what we have here.

332
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,309
What are we... We gotta get that car back!

333
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,396
Just back off, Charlie!

334
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,991
If you don't wanna hang around, go back
to your barbecues and your brunches.

335
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,953
We don't have to get the car back.
We can buy a new one.

336
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,111
520, 540,

337
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,708
560, 580, 600.

338
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,150
OK. Now, I need to see
some valid identification

339
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,635
and something showing
you have insurance.

340
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,355
- Can you take my word for it?
- No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.

341
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,756
OK.

342
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,276
- How about Mr Franklin's?
- Now we're talking.

343
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,312
Come on, Charlie, talk to me.
What's on your mind?

344
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,470
You wanna know where I got the money
for the car, right?

345
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,553
I wanna know where you got that car,
that you can just leave it like that.

346
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,148
<i>Then</i> I wanna know
where you got the money.

347
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,677
# D-I-V-O-R-C-E

348
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,231
Equal distribution of assets.
It's a popular tune.

349
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,476
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

350
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,036
Don't be sorry. I'm not sorry.

351
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,311
Charlie, don't worry about that car.
It was still registered in his name.

352
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,352
You got to stop worrying so much.

353
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,359
- Hi! You guys want a ride?
- Thank you, thank you.

354
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,436
Hop in.

355
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,433
- Here, let me...
- Welcome aboard.

356
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,036
# Wild thing

357
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,876
# You make my heart sing

358
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,911
# You make everything groovy

359
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,316
# Wild thing

360
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,797
# Wild thing

361
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,876
# I think I love you

362
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,789
# But I wanna know for sure

363
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,594
# Come on, hold me tight

364
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,916
# I love you

365
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,436
Thanks for the ride.

366
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,276
Bye, Lulu.

367
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,271
- Thank you!
- Pleasure to meet you.

368
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,236
Thank you, ladies.

369
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,792
Ladies, we need something
for the gentleman here.

370
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,956
Follow me.

371
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,756
Oh, Charlie!

372
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,796
- It's you.
- Forget it.

373
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,672
No. No. I will not buy this.

374
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,473
- Look at this.
- Absolutely, with all certainty, no.

375
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,479
- It brings out the blue in those eyes.
- Yes, but still...

376
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,955
- Ladies, what do you think?
- No.

377
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,911
Very nice.

378
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,549
Oh, God!

379
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,353
If you were my mother
and I presented him as my husband,

380
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,550
- what would you think?
- Very nice.

381
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,514
But I'd get rid of those handcuffs,
if I were you.

382
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,756
Charlie!

383
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,516
Don't look so surprised.

384
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,276
Get in the car.

385
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,517
- Where are we?
- Come here, Charlie.

386
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,036
- What are you doing?
- I'm setting you free.

387
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,709
- Maybe I don't wanna be free.
- Maybe you're not.

388
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,114
Come on.

389
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,357
Hello!

390
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,998
- Don't call me Lulu. Call me Audrey.
- Audrey?

391
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,998
- Audrey! What a surprise!
- Hi, Mama.

392
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,314
Mom, I want you to meet
my husband Charlie.

393
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,238
- Oh. Well, hello, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you, Mrs, uh...

394
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,078
Just call me Peaches.

395
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,395
- That's her real name.
- Peaches...

396
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,190
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

397
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,869
Charlie, exactly how did y'all decide
to come down here?

398
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,674
Audrey just said "let's go visit
my mother", so here we are.

399
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,231
Audrey is very impulsive.
It's one of the things I like about her.

400
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,511
And, dear, exactly when
did y'all get married?

401
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,155
In September.
We're still newlyweds really.

402
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,353
You'll have to visit us.
We have an extra room.

403
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,914
It's gonna be the baby's room some day.

404
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,271
Charlie fixed it up.
He's really good with his hands.

405
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,229
He wants a big family, but I think
just a boy and a girl would be nice.

406
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,477
- Don't you, honey?
- Whatever you want, honey.

407
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,673
See, Mama? He's just the kind of man
you always said I should marry.

408
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,073
Mama, we're gonna lie down for a bit
cos we've been driving all day.

409
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,078
- Why'd you tell her we were married?
- I wanted to make her happy.

410
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,954
- She doesn't know you were married?
- No. She didn't like him anyway.

411
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,753
Next time, let me know your plans.
I almost lost it.

412
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,032
That was part of the surprise. I wanted
to see if you could think on your feet.

413
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,957
How'd I do?

414
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,232
Like I said, you're a pretty good liar
when you wanna be, Charlie.

415
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,436
Audrey Hankel.

416
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,276
The guy was, like, taking all the way. So
I'm running in like an idiot, and I slide in.

417
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,518
Everybody's so surprised.
The catcher is holding the ball.

418
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,518
I slide home, I steal home,
we win the game.

419
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,479
Oh, God, it was great!

420
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,797
Well, I'm glad it was
such a good game for you.

421
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,039
- This is good food too.
- Well, I expect you to eat it all up then.

422
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,912
You've got a real wife somewhere,
don't you, Charlie?

423
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,430
Uh, well,
that's a little complicated, Peaches.

424
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,711
- Do you love my daughter?
- I just met her recently.

425
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,796
It's kinda hard to...

426
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,870
You take care then.
She's got some strange notions about life.

427
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,797
Yep. I know.

428
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,719
Oh, my gosh!

429
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,952
I had this dress in high school.
Mama saves everything.

430
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,469
- Don't you, Mama?
- Of course I do.

431
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,510
We packed a suitcase and I left it sitting
right by the door. I'm glad I had this dress.

432
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,475
But poor Charlie's gotta wear what he's
got on the whole weekend. Poor baby.

433
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,797
Goodbye, Mama.

434
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,276
We'll try and get down more often.
Charlie's job keeps him so busy.

435
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,517
Oh, I understand, dear.
Just come when you can.

436
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,151
- Give her a kiss.
- Goodbye, Peaches.

437
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,397
Come on. She's my mama, Charlie.
Give her a kiss.

438
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,394
- Bye, Charlie.
- Thank you for the meal. It was...

439
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,238
- Bye, Max
- Heads up, Max.

440
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,875
- I hope things work out for you, Charlie.
- Good luck to you too!

441
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,195
It was wonderful meeting you, Peaches.

442
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,276
Here, let me...

443
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,356
Come on! Let's go.

444
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,399
- You wanna tell me where we're going?
- No.

445
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,356
- So long!
-  Bye.

446
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,357
I love you, Mama.

447
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,959
# <i>Ever fallen in love</i>

448
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,638
# <i>In love with someone</i>

449
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,318
# <i>Ever fallen in love</i>

450
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,398
# <i>In love with somone</i>
<i>you shouldn't have fallen in love with</i>

451
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,710
- Jesus, what's this?
- Get ready, Charlie.

452
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,595
My high school reunion.
God, I'm so nervous.

453
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,676
Are you kidding me?

454
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,077
Wait, wait, wait!
Who am I supposed to be?

455
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,156
- Oh!
- OK.

456
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,555
Am I supposed to sign in here?

457
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,189
- Audrey Hankel?
- Yeah.

458
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,277
Remember me? Donna Penski?

459
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,830
- Yeah, sure, Donna. How are you?
- Fine.

460
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,349
Audrey! James. James Williams.

461
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,033
James! Hi!

462
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,720
How you doin'?
This is my husband Charlie.

463
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,388
- Hello, James.
- Pleased to meet you, Charlie.

464
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,318
We have a booklet
with the names and addresses

465
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,908
of all the people
who weren't able to make it tonight.

466
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,359
Oh, really?

467
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,391
Audrey! Smile, please.

468
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,078
Thank you.

469
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,239
- I bet you've got kids, don't you?
- Two, a boy and a girl.

470
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,715
Oh, that's nice. What are their names?

471
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,356
Their names?

472
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,075
- Scott and Leslie.
- Scott and Leslie.

473
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,517
# I thought love
was only true in fairy tales

474
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,595
# Meant for someone else and not for me

475
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,391
# Love was out to get me

476
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,238
# That's the way it seemed

477
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,749
# Disappointments haunted all my dreams

478
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,236
# Then I saw her face

479
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,351
# Now I'm a believer

480
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,277
# Not a trace

481
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,231
# Of doubt in my mind

482
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,316
# I'm in love

483
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,711
# I'm a believer
I just couldn't leave her if I tried

484
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,077
# What's the use in tryin'?

485
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,952
# All you get is pain

486
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,196
# When I needed sunshine, I got rain

487
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,076
Whooo!

488
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,991
# I'm a believer

489
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,872
# I'm a believer

490
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,831
# I'm a believer

491
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,916
# I'm a believer

492
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,556
I want a big Badger yell.

493
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,796
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!

494
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,397
That guy's in my office!

495
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,193
I've always been an introverted, shy guy.

496
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,712
Charles Driggs!

497
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,594
Ah! God! No!
Just let me do the talking.

498
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,836
- Larry!
- What the hell are you doing here?

499
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,872
I thought you never got out of the office!

500
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,595
You remember my wife Peggy?
You met Charles at the Christmas party.

501
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,951
Congrats on that promotion.
You really deserve it.

502
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,993
- I knew you'd go right to the top.
- Thanks. That's nice of you to say.

503
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,759
I bet you say that to all the new VPs.

504
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,553
Uh, this is Audrey.
We've known each other for...

505
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,749
We're lovers.

506
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,111
Only in the sense
that all human beings are... lovers.

507
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,276
Audrey Driggs?

508
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,119
I had to take his name for the baby's sake.

509
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,312
- You're having his child?
- I <i>think</i> it's his child.

510
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,110
Larry works in accounting,
down the hall from me, right?

511
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,755
Is this the guy who would've wondered
why you were using company plastic

512
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,792
yesterday afternoon
in that motel in New Jersey?

513
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,958
Hell, Charles, we could've covered that.
Just let me know next time.

514
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,716
See?

515
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,393
This is my wife Peggy.

516
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,308
We went to school together, Larry.
Remember? It's our reunion.

517
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,396
- Hello, Audrey.
- Hi.

518
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,312
Reunions are fun, aren't they?

519
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,237
Come on, Larry.

520
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,316
Will you excuse us?

521
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,589
Driggs, I didn't think you had it in you.

522
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,916
Oh-ho...

523
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,555
- Thank you.
- Charlie!

524
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,195
- Charlie, relax.
- Relax?

525
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,318
What were you doing over there?
That guy works in my office.

526
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,639
If he opens his mouth about any of this,
and, believe me, he will, I'm ruined.

527
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,796
Charlie, you are vice president.

528
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,558
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
He thinks you're a hero.

529
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,916
Charlie, what's wrong?

530
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,272
I'll tell you what's wrong. Company
plastic. Valid company credit cards.

531
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,153
They were in my wallet.
It was in my jacket. It's gone.

532
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,034
My MCI number, my access card
to get me into my own building!

533
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,711
I mean, God knows who's got them!
My Christmas Club voucher... Oh, crap!

534
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,679
- If I don't get it back, you know what?
- What?

535
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,916
I'm fucked!

536
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,036
Charlie, I got it.

537
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,076
I got your wallet.

538
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,032
You got my wallet?

539
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,357
It fell out of your jacket and I picked it up.

540
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,116
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

541
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,955
It's in the glove compartment.

542
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,516
Lulu, look. Uh...

543
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,952
God, you're a great girl. You got
a few problems, but you're a great girl.

544
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,153
And you're loaded with potential.
But you're too much for me.

545
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,714
I can't handle this.

546
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,630
Let me get my wallet and I'll catch a bus
and go back to my boring, very safe life.

547
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,552
While I've still got one.

548
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,878
Charlie, I'm sorry. I didn't think
it was that important. I'm sorry.

549
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,870
You believe me, don't you?

550
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,956
Yeah, yeah, course I do.

551
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,078
Tomorrow you're gonna wake up,
you're still gonna be Charlie Driggs.

552
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,748
And this'll all be over and done with.

553
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,314
So why don't we enjoy it while we can.

554
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,440
And then tomorrow, no more Lulu.

555
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,796
Unless you really wanna go.

556
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,676
Then go.

557
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,796
# I'll be there

558
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,676
# Any time

559
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,116
# You need me

560
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,236
# By your side

561
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,638
# To dry away

562
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,669
# Every teardrop that you cry

563
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,511
# And if he ever leaves you blue

564
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,992
# Just remember

565
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,678
# I love you

566
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,756
# And I'll be there

567
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,792
# Before the next teardrop falls

568
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,876
# And I'll be there

569
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,676
# Before the next

570
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,351
# Teardrop falls

571
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,838
The Feelies! The Feelies!
Come on! Thank you!

572
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,040
You want something... from the bar?

573
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,355
I sure would love a soda.

574
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,591
I'm gonna get some air.
I'll be outside, over there.

575
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,516
OK?

576
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,711
If I could just... Is it possible?

577
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,831
Got a light?

578
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,077
Uh... Well, let me... No, I don't think so.

579
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,078
I'm Irene. I don't believe in name tags.

580
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,953
Oh. Right. Charlie. I, uh...

581
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,188
never had many concrete convictions
about them one way or another.

582
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,357
- You're Audrey's husband, aren't you?
- Uh... Yeah.

583
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,438
Yeah? You don't sound too convinced.

584
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,314
I can hardly believe it myself.
We haven't known each other long.

585
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,513
- You don't exactly seem her type.
- Yeah, well, what can I tell you?

586
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,634
Hi, Audrey.
Check out Charlie at the end of the bar.

587
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,716
Dated, married, church wedding,
you know... And, uh...

588
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,199
I had no idea
Charles had such a way with the ladies.

589
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,673
Neither did he.

590
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,268
- I work in the city.
- Doing what?

591
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,589
You seem overly interested
in Audrey and me.

592
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,676
We're old friends.

593
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,596
Can I get a soda? Can I get a soda?

594
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,708
Charlie?
I get up to New York once in a while.

595
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,876
- What?
- I get up to New York once in a while.

596
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,796
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

597
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,797
- Like to have a drink with me?
- What?

598
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,956
Wanna have a drink in New York?

599
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,039
Yeah. No! No. I'm married.
I got... I'm a married man.

600
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,399
Listen...

601
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,478
Enjoy the reunion, all right?
Nice meeting you.

602
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,149
# Fame, makes a man take things over

603
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,917
# Fame, lets him loose
and hard to swallow

604
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,069
# Fame, puts you there
where things are hollow

605
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,516
# Fame

606
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,711
# Fame, what you like is in the limo

607
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,796
# Fame, what you get is no tomorrow

608
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,597
# Fame, what you need
you have to borrow

609
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,956
# Fame

610
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,356
Oh, God!

611
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,556
Hi, baby. Surprise!

612
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,558
Hi, Charlie.

613
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,875
- Let's go.
- Why? What's wrong?

614
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,956
Let's just go.

615
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,320
Charles, hey. Are you
gonna be around tomorrow?

616
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,000
Uh... we kind of wanna
get an early start back.

617
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,031
- How about brunch?
- Uh, how about brunch?

618
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,358
- Hi there!
- Hi. Charles Driggs. Audrey's husband.

619
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,075
Well, Charlie, pleased to meet you.
I'm Ray. This is Irene.

620
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,673
Yeah, we've met.

621
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,633
- Hi. I'm Larry Dillman.
- Hi. I'm Ray. This is Irene.

622
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,957
Irene, hi. This is Chloe
and my wife Peggy. Ray and Irene.

623
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,717
Hi.

624
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,638
Well, we know old Peg. Don't we, Peg?

625
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,353
Hi, Ray.

626
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,117
- Charles and I work together in New York.
- Really? Ain't that somethin'?

627
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,630
- Slavin' away over the old...
- Here he comes now!

628
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,274
Haven't seen you in a while, Audrey.

629
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,029
- Seems like only yesterday, Ray.
- How time changes things.

630
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,470
- Oh, too true.
- That's what life's all about, huh?

631
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,194
Speaking of changing things,
we have to go.

632
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,232
- See you all in ten years.
- OK.

633
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,510
- Take care, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you.

634
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,553
- Listen, shall we... OK, let's do it.
- Bye, Peg. Bye, Larry.

635
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,194
Boy, there's a guy who landed on his feet.

636
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,435
How's that?

637
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,758
Nine months ago, his wife takes the kids
and runs off with the family dentist.

638
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,599
It's the best thing
that ever happened to him.

639
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,676
Yeah, I believe that.

640
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,914
- Damn it!
- Don't flood it.

641
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,274
Hi, you all!

642
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,712
- How'd you get out here so fast?
- Always keep 'em guessing, Charlie.

643
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,070
I thought we could have a drink together.

644
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,919
The party's over here.
We still got time for a quick one.

645
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,235
Thanks, but no thanks, Ray.

646
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,316
Oh, come on!

647
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,836
It'll be fun.

648
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,034
- You don't mind, do you, Charlie?
- No, it's OK with me. Honey?

649
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,990
Whaddaya say, Audrey? One drink?

650
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,275
You don't want me to tell Charlie
how you spent your free periods, do ya?

651
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,232
- Come on! One drink!
- OK, one drink.

652
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,113
All right! I'll drive, Charlie!

653
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,475
Hey, Charlie, how do you like this baby?

654
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,477
- Oh, God, it's a beauty, Ray.
- Yeah.

655
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,388
- They don't make 'em like this any more.
- Boy, this baby travels.

656
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,958
- What do you drive?
- I, uh... a Ford station wagon.

657
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,036
A station wagon?

658
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,756
Hey, guys! How ya doin', huh?

659
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,156
- Larry, baby!
- We're going for pizza. Wanna come?

660
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,350
- Uh... pizza?
- I don't want no pizza.

661
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,278
No, no, we can't. We've made other plans.

662
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,076
Sure. Anyway, see you Monday morning,
Mr Vice President, huh?

663
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,516
OK! See ya!

664
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,836
He'll get in trouble with those guys.

665
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,993
- So you're a vice president, huh?
- Yep. Just got promoted.

666
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,038
Well, we're gonna have to make this
a night to remember.

667
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,674
# <i>Dressed in a white shirt</i>

668
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,993
# <i>With my hair combed straight</i>

669
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,276
# <i>Here in my black shoes...</i>

670
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,914
Irene, why don't you and Charlie
get us some six packs?

671
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,917
- Yeah, come on, Irene.
- Ray!

672
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,510
Where are your manners?
It's your town. Why don't you go?

673
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,559
I'll go.

674
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,999
Let him go.

675
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,519
I'll go.

676
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,951
- Irene, why don't you go with her?
- I'll go with her.

677
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,956
Ooooh-eee!

678
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,476
Look at that Audrey.

679
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,149
She is a work of art, huh?

680
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,316
Oh, yeah.

681
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,672
- You're a lucky man, Charlie.
- Oh, don't I know it!

682
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,758
- How long have you been married?
- What is it now? A year ago, September.

683
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,996
- Still newlyweds, really.
- Yeah?

684
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,272
- You know...
- That's wonderful. It really is.

685
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,359
- Where you living these days?
- We got a nice place out in Long Island.

686
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,358
- Yeah? Where?
- Stony Brook.

687
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,997
- I'm fixing a room up for the kids...
- You got kids?

688
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,669
- Well, we intend to have them.
- Yeah? That's great.

689
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,156
- Audrey was a little wild in high school.
- Oh, well, yes, I can believe that!

690
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,589
But I knew
she'd get herself together one day.

691
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,711
Oh... Thank you, Ray.

692
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,429
Irene, how long has he been in town?

693
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,790
- I don't know.
- When did he get out?

694
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,194
I don't know!

695
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,959
- Come on, Irene!
- I swear to God, I don't know.

696
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,231
I was just as surprised as you were
when he showed up.

697
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,316
Oh, God.

698
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,194
I wonder what they're talking about.

699
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,515
Now there's a question.

700
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,111
- I shouldn't be asking you this...
- No, no, no. Anything.

701
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,309
Yeah?

702
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,238
Audrey was the hottest thing in school.

703
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,070
And I was wondering,
what is she really like?

704
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,196
What a gal, Ray. I mean, what a gal!

705
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,392
She is... She's impulsive and...
her imagination...

706
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,398
No, no, no! I mean in bed.

707
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,236
What am I doing?

708
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,429
Oh, God! Uh... well, she's, uh...

709
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,356
Come on, Charlie, you gotta admit she
looks like she could fuck you right in half.

710
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,713
- I mean, just fuck you to pieces.
- Ray, there's no call for that kind of talk.

711
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,276
You're right.

712
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,636
You're right.

713
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,072
I understand.

714
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,316
Sorry, Charlie.

715
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,112
No...

716
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,196
Sorry, Charlie.

717
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,477
Come on...

718
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,231
We friends?

719
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,316
Sure. Oh, yeah.

720
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,711
OK.

721
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,912
I'm gonna go get me some smokes.
I'll be right back.

722
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,470
You're a good guy, Charlie.
I don't care what they say.

723
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,155
Irene, Charlie's lonely out there.

724
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,359
Why don't you give us
a coupla minutes alone?

725
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,716
Go on! Go keep him company.

726
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,559
- I got nothing to say to you, Ray.
- Come here!

727
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,874
I was hoping you'd show up tonight.

728
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,592
- When'd you get out?
- I've been lookin' for you.

729
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,917
How did you get out, Ray?

730
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,998
- Who's this Charlie guy?
- He's nobody. I just met him.

731
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,671
Oh, yeah? He's out there braggin'
about what a great piece of ass you are.

732
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,711
Bullshit, Ray. You're sick.

733
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,229
He's too nice
to say something like that.

734
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,395
Audrey!

735
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,109
I missed you so goddamn much!

736
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,559
- Every sweet little part of you.
- Don't...

737
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,949
You should've never quit me, baby.

738
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,197
I tried to explain to you
in the last letter I wrote you.

739
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,393
Write me?! Fuck, Audrey! I'm up
for a nickel and all you can do is write?!

740
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,715
I don't wanna talk about it, Ray.

741
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,516
I said I'd have one drink with you.
But it's over. Remember that, OK?

742
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,397
Are you saying
that you don't love me any more?

743
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,836
Is that what you're saying?

744
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,118
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
- Yeah, right.

745
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,719
Hey, Charlie's got a beer.
Where's my beer?

746
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,356
- Right here.
- Aah... Damn! I forgot to get cigarettes.

747
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,869
Can you get me some cigarettes,
please? Please?

748
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,070
Sure. There ya go.

749
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,070
Thanks, Irene. You're all right.

750
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,359
- Hurry up, Irene.
- Oh, yeah.

751
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,871
Charlie, watch this.

752
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,468
Ray, wait! Ray!

753
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,909
- What are you doin', Ray?
- What's it look like?

754
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,474
- Irene!
- Wait, there's Irene!

755
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,716
She's a big girl. She'll be OK.

756
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,960
Besides, this is your night to celebrate.
I thought I'd make it just the three of us.

757
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,310
Come on, hop up in front. Come on!

758
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,512
- Yeah, well, all right, Ray.
- Come on. There ya go.

759
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,791
- Come on, Audrey.
- No.

760
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,956
Well, looks like it's you and me, pal.

761
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,640
# Goodnight, Irene...

762
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,275
What are we stoppin' for now?

763
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,108
Still gotta get my smokes, remember?

764
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,596
Come on, Charlie.
I wanna show you something.

765
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,191
Oh, boy.
I'm gonna grab some more beverages.

766
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,071
- You want anything?
- Stay here with me.

767
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,590
Audrey, I'll leave the radio on.
You don't think she'd leave us, do you?

768
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,950
No. You wouldn't do that, would you?

769
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,709
- Come on. I wanna show you something.
- Great.

770
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,636
Take it easy.

771
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,915
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

772
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,510
- Ever been on TV?
- No, Ray. I've never been on television.

773
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,358
- Here's your chance.
- Why? What?

774
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,189
- You're new vice president, huh?
- I am the new VP. Don't you forget it.

775
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,436
All right. Well, make a speech.

776
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,876
Oh, look at that!

777
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,236
- You're on, slick.
- Yeah.

778
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,393
Uh...

779
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,437
Hello! Hey! Hey!

780
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,788
- Hello.
- How are you?

781
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,388
- What can I do for you?
- Let me have a pack of Mariboros.

782
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,795
Mariboros. Will that be all?

783
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,629
<i>...</i> to Larry Dillman,
a man whose discretion

784
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,309
is exceeded only
by his bad taste in suits.

785
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,437
Thank you. Thank you very much.

786
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,391
Thank you. Sit down!

787
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,715
Please, sit down.

788
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,633
I don't think we got Mariboros.

789
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,550
...thanks to my wonderful wife Audrey,
who has stood by me through...

790
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,557
Wow!

791
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,557
Hey!

792
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,990
Jesus Christ! Ray, what are you? Oh!

793
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,838
You OK?

794
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,996
Bastard, Ray!

795
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,276
Are you all right, Charlie?

796
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,674
Get up! Get up!

797
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,112
Ray, goddamn you!

798
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,196
Just shut up, Audrey!

799
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,512
I'm gonna tell you something, Charlie.

800
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,154
When I used to do this for a living,

801
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,431
I used to pull a job at some liquor store,

802
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,836
run around the corner,
pull off the ski mask I was wearing,

803
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,954
put on a different coat and walk
right back into the place I just robbed.

804
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,631
Man, it was wild! They'd be so flipped out,
they wouldn't know their own mothers.

805
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,038
I'd be standing there when they described
what happened and who robbed 'em.

806
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:23,995
Half the time, they thought
it was some spook that did it.

807
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,634
They'll see your face
on the videotape, pal.

808
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,069
It just might be you they get.

809
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,596
Come on! Come on, move it!

810
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,077
OK, boys and giris. Let's play
a little game of true confessions.

811
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,795
- Get away from him. Just get away.
- Just checking his nose.

812
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,152
Now I know you two
can't really be married.

813
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,952
I haven't seen you in a while,

814
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,231
but they woulda sent me papers
if you were divorcing me.

815
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,598
So why don't you two lovebirds
just tell me what the fuck is goin' on?

816
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,318
Tell me, goddammit!

817
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,273
-  Knock it off in there!
- You knock it the fuck off!

818
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,597
Stop it, Ray! Cut it out! Ray, stop it!

819
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,196
I'll tell you, all right?

820
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,712
He's just a guy. I picked him up
on the street in New York.

821
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:03,637
We pretended to be married for Mama,
and it just carried over to the reunion.

822
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,116
The guy's got a real wife
and two real children.

823
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,073
- It's just a joke that got outta hand.
- Bullshit!

824
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,952
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

825
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,198
-  Shut up in there!
- You shut the fuck up, goddammit!

826
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,356
Ray...

827
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,074
I met him yesterday.
There's nothing going on.

828
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,270
Nothing. OK?

829
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,029
Look at you.
You look like a goddamn TV show.

830
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,311
Just like he does.

831
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,908
I may not be educated,
like Charlie-boy there,

832
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,996
but I am not stupid.

833
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,196
She's telling you the truth, Ray.

834
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,476
Is she?

835
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,355
Is she telling me the truth, Charlie?

836
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:11,995
Yes.

837
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,873
Yeah? Here...

838
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,680
Ray, you're making a big deal
out of nothing!

839
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,588
- I'm sorry I lied to you, Charlie!
- You're still lying!

840
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,553
I know for a fact
that your friend isn't married.

841
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,071
- His wife left him because of you.
- What? What?!

842
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,792
Are you out of your mind?!

843
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,718
I only met him yesterday!

844
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,957
How many times
do you want me to say it?

845
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,236
Tell me, Charlie,

846
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,038
when did your wife leave you?

847
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,278
I can't imagine where you heard that, Ray.
That's absolutely ridiculous.

848
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,595
- Tell me, Charlie.
- It's not true.

849
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,315
I have a wife. I have a family. I have...

850
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,551
Forget it.

851
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,830
- Charlie...
- Ow! Last September.

852
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,876
Last September?

853
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,395
You're a really good liar, Charlie.

854
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:20,035
Charlie, this is Audrey.
Audrey, this is Charlie.

855
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,316
Who's shittin' who here?

856
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,876
Unbelievable!

857
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,349
Let me ask you a question.

858
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,631
- Did you ever box?
- No.

859
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,196
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

860
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,276
- You sure?
- Yeah.

861
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,392
- Here. Have a shot.
- No. Thank you.

862
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,756
Audrey?

863
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,955
I used to spar around a lot in the joint.

864
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,629
It was just me
and a bunch of the brothers.

865
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,479
They all thought I was crazy.

866
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:13,116
By the time I got out of there though,
they all had respect for me, Charlie.

867
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,436
Got my nose broke three times
in three years, but... what the hell?

868
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,236
A broken nose ain't gonna kill ya.

869
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,479
No, it won't kill you, Ray,
but violence never solved anything.

870
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,513
What goes around, comes around.
You're gonna learn that some day.

871
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,074
Ray, would you just get him outta here?

872
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,034
Shit, baby, he's gonna have the cops here
before we get around the block.

873
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,472
Why? What is he gonna say?
Nobody forced him to come along.

874
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,478
If he opens his mouth,
he can take his house in the suburbs,

875
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,398
and his lawn and his station wagon,

876
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,637
and his normal life,
and flush it right down the toilet.

877
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,038
Unless, of course,
you were lying about that too, Charlie?

878
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,355
No, I'm not lying about that.

879
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,233
Do you understand the situation?

880
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,278
Yeah.

881
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,750
I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.

882
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,836
Get the fuck out.

883
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,759
Old habits die hard, huh, baby?

884
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,276
Charlie!

885
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,948
- Fill her up?
- Yeah, fill her up.

886
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,394
Fill her up?

887
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,988
Uh, yeah. You take credit cards... Nelson?

888
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,194
- Yeah, Charlie. All major brands.
- How'd you know my name?

889
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,397
- Your tag.
- Oh!

890
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,476
Yeah, yeah.

891
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,436
Thank you.

892
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,355
- All right, Charlie, that's $13.50.
- Thanks, Nelson. Put it on there.

893
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,552
And put a soda on there too.
And a road map.

894
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,910
Hey, anything you want, Charlie.

895
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,190
Excuse me, Joy.

896
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,670
- Hey, that shirt. What happened?
- What?

897
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,271
- Your shirt?
- Oh. I'm, uh... prone to nosebleeds, so...

898
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,913
- Yeah, let's put a shirt on.
- Put a shirt on.

899
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,157
OK? And how about a hat?

900
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,350
You got it. Right here for you.

901
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,758
- And, uh... do you have any trousers?
- No trousers. How about some shorts?

902
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,793
- Shorts? Yeah! Let's go with some shorts.
- You're about a large, right?

903
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,878
Large. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good.

904
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,036
OK. How about some socks?

905
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,435
Socks? Yeah, put some socks on the...

906
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,358
- There you go.
- Sounds good.

907
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,588
- Fix me up, Nelson.
- Hey, Charlie? Attempt to be cool.

908
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,512
- Hey, you some kind of spy, Charlie?
- Shh, Nelson!

909
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,676
OK...

910
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:19,119
- Sunglasses. I need sunglasses.
- Nah, keep 'em. You're beautiful.

911
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,316
OK, all right.

912
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,472
- There you are.
- OK.

913
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,275
You oughta really see somebody
about that nose.

914
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,039
A broken nose ain't gonna kill ya, Nelson.

915
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,628
OK, there's that, there's this...
OK, thank you.

916
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,637
- Hey.
- All right, Nelson.

917
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,436
Hello. How are you?

918
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,796
Hi.

919
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,632
- Can I help you?
- How much are these babies?

920
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,512
$49.95.

921
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,596
- Credit cards OK?
- Sure.

922
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,117
Ring 'em up.

923
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,390
Will there be anything else?

924
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,076
Yeah.

925
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,153
Yeah. One of these shirts.

926
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:42,038
"I have recently completed managerial
training for the LB Discount Shoe stores."

927
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,357
"It looks like I'll soon
be living in Fairfield, Iowa,

928
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,119
where a new franchise has just opened."
Oh, boy!

929
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,915
"Accompanying me will be my wife Joyce
and three small fries,

930
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:56,750
Billy, 5, Tina, 3, and the newest addition,
little Eric Junior, 11 months."

931
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,836
What a dumb shit!

932
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,156
- What?
- I'm gonna change.

933
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,198
Yeah, I wanna see
how that new suit looks on you.

934
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,073
- Hey, Audrey!
- Yeah?

935
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,998
- I wanna see how that suit looks on you.
- Wait!

936
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,553
- We going swimming or aren't we?
- Just wait a minute.

937
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,591
Hey, Audrey, what's goin' on?

938
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,676
- Don't come in.
- You all right?

939
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,748
Hey!

940
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,354
- Audrey!
-

941
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,152
Come here!

942
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,236
What are you doing?

943
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,949
- It's over this way.
- Stop it! Stop it, Ray!

944
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,514
Come on, I'll show you. Come on!

945
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,834
No, no...

946
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,952
You wanted to swim?
You wanna swim, swim!

947
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,836
Asshole!

948
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,234
They look like a terrible couple.

949
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,518
- We're closed.
- All I need is two minutes.

950
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,232
We're open tomorrow at seven.

951
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,272
I already know what I want.
Come on. Please?

952
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,998
Mister? Do you need any help?

953
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,750
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- OK.

954
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,596
You like it around here?

955
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,159
It's OK.

956
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,396
Don't you get kinda bored?

957
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,676
Yeah, sometimes.

958
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,196
Sometimes?

959
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,998
Sometimes what?

960
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,351
Sometimes it's boring,
or sometimes there's something to do?

961
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,357
Sometimes it's boring.

962
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,315
- What's your name?
- Tracy.

963
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,836
Tracy, I'm Ray.

964
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,716
- Hi.
- Hi.

965
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,356
OK. Fine. Here we go.

966
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:21,155
I'll have a JD burger and some fries.
And some extra pickles.

967
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,510
And a beer and a coke.

968
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,553
- You got it.
- Thanks.

969
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,596
Hey, fella, you using the telephone?

970
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,676
No, go ahead.

971
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,874
Sit down and relax
and we'll get you some coffee.

972
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,560
Darlene? Coffee, please, for George.

973
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,556
- How about dessert?
- Let me have the Rustler's Rhapsody.

974
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:42,116
- Rustler's Rhapsody.
- Just a coffee for me, Darlene.

975
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,596
- In a flash.
- You don't mind, do you, Ray?

976
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,757
You're outta your mind.
You don't know what you're doin'.

977
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,677
Charlie!

978
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,912
You are one dumb son of a bitch!

979
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,714
I'm almost starting to like you, Charlie.

980
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,796
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Darlene.

981
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,276
I want Lulu.

982
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,757
Is that your name this week? Lulu?

983
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,349
Yes.

984
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,951
You know, Charlie,
she's not gonna be too happy

985
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,231
driving around in a station wagon
the rest of her life.

986
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,316
You better think about that.

987
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:22,869
You better ask yourself
if you really want her.

988
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,678
I really want her.

989
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:28,630
Awww.

990
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,591
Great.

991
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,639
Charlie, you gotta fight
for a woman like this.

992
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,156
I don't have to fight you. We'll waltz outta
here, and there's not a thing you can do.

993
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,798
Grrr!

994
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:49,271
Oh, Charlie. You are somethin'.
You are somethin'!

995
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,390
Take a look over there.

996
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,397
Go ahead.

997
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,315
- Evening, officer.
- How's it goin'?

998
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:10,990
Ray, you're a convicted felon
in possession of a concealed weapon.

999
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,113
You robbed a grocery store,
assaulted that poor kid with a gun.

1000
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,231
You left Pennsylvania, which is gonna
come as a surprise to your parole officer.

1001
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:24,592
And I'd be willing to wager
that Cadillac of yours is hot.

1002
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,916
Charlie...

1003
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,718
Now it's you with something to lose.

1004
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,592
Fuck you.

1005
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,635
- He's got you, Ray.
- Fuck you too, Lulu.

1006
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,393
Evening, officers.

1007
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,080
- How ya doin'?
- Oh, pretty good, thank you.

1008
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,236
Hand over the car keys.

1009
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,040
Come on, hand over the car keys.

1010
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,230
At JD's - where else?

1011
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,116
- Let's go.
- You're gonna regret this.

1012
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,390
- Well, life's full of regrets.
- No.

1013
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,754
You are <i>really</i> gonna regret this.

1014
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,352
- Now your wallet.
- Charlie, come on!

1015
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,151
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you, Charlie?

1016
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,477
Pretty smart.

1017
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,474
But look, Ray, just to show you
there's no hard feelings,

1018
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,111
this one's on me.

1019
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,474
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1020
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,439
The gentleman said
you'd take care of this.

1021
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,071
That son of a bitch.

1022
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,794
Yow!

1023
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,319
God, that was great!

1024
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,399
Oh, man, that'll teach him
to fool with Charlie Driggs, I'll tell you.

1025
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,517
OK, liar. Get out!

1026
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,717
- What, you jokin'?
- You saved me, I saved you. Now get out!

1027
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,071
- I'm not getting out of the car.
- Get out of the fucking car!

1028
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,192
- I'm in the middle of Virginia!
- Charlie, go!

1029
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,231
- No! I'm not...
- Goddammit! Get out!

1030
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:16,353
- It's the middle of the night!
- Get out of the fucking car, Charlie!

1031
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,515
OK...

1032
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,596
What are you?

1033
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,478
Aw...

1034
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,198
You're... Sometimes I don't know
whether you're kiddin' around or not.

1035
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,232
Goddamn you, Charlie!
I saw your wedding ring!

1036
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,749
Shit, I saw the family pictures!

1037
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:49,270
I get involved with a married man
who's not even married?!

1038
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,153
I was married
when those pictures were taken.

1039
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,709
Very funny.

1040
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,276
I wear the ring because
I hate to admit that my family fell apart.

1041
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,914
I told you I was married to protect myself.

1042
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,873
And then I was afraid that if I told you,
you'd take off.

1043
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,991
You're right, asshole. I would've.

1044
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:13,113
- You were lying a blue streak to me too.
- Exactly.

1045
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,471
Oh, thank you, Lord!

1046
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,309
Come in, come in.
Come, come, come! Come around!

1047
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,874
Come in! Come in! Come in! Come in!

1048
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,638
OK...

1049
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,957
I'll be back in a couple of days, OK?
You gonna be here?

1050
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,514
Did your sister really run off
with a Bible salesman?

1051
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,791
I swear to God. The religious types
are the worst kind.

1052
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,593
- I'll be back, OK? You'll be here?
- Mm-hm.

1053
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,714
OK, I better get going, all right?

1054
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,150
- Go on, go on. Go home!
- See ya.

1055
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,236
Hurry up. Go on.

1056
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,869
<i>... can't do anything but fail.</i>

1057
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,312
<i>Did you see the SOS</i>
<i>Jesus COD'd to you?</i>

1058
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,838
<i>Are you saved?</i>

1059
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,916
<i>Are you good?</i>

1060
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,156
<i>Are you OK?</i>

1061
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,716
<i>It's late.</i>

1062
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,116
<i>Time to go.</i>

1063
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:34,916
<i>Thanks, Reverend Jim. It's 5 o'clock</i>
<i>right now, a.m., Baltimore time.</i>

1064
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,996
<i>We're comin' at you live.</i>

1065
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,309
It's so strange.

1066
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,834
- Did you say something?
- I just don't wanna go to my apartment.

1067
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,996
Shit...

1068
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,677
Well...

1069
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,950
you can stay at my place.

1070
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,798
For tonight.

1071
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,552
There's not much in the way of furniture,
but there's plenty of room.

1072
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,196
OK, thanks.

1073
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,476
Audrey Hankel.

1074
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,478
Yeah, uh... Stony Brook.

1075
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,710
Charles Driggs.

1076
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,400
Yeah, with a D. D-R, yeah.

1077
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,795
Lemme have the address on that.

1078
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:02,435
1427 Maple. 1427 Maple. Thanks.

1079
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,876
- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall, to the left.

1080
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,956
Charlie...

1081
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:45,954
Yeah?

1082
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,915
What are you gonna do now you've seen
how the other half lives?

1083
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,996
The other half?

1084
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,076
The other half of you.

1085
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,432
Hiya, Charlie.

1086
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,635
Ray!

1087
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,596
Get up!

1088
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,919
Let's see what you're made of now,
Charlie!

1089
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,676
Charlie?

1090
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,156
Charlie?

1091
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,272
Ray, stop it! You'll kill him!

1092
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,356
I'm just warming up!

1093
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,236
Get out of the way!

1094
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,518
Ow!

1095
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:09,110
I'm glad to see you finally
made it to the suburbs, bitch!

1096
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,392
Come here!

1097
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,276
I don't care...

1098
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,149
what she tells you, I know my wife.

1099
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,389
And you white-bread VIP types
just don't do it for her.

1100
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,669
- You all right there, Charlie?
- Charlie, I'm gonna get help!

1101
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,512
Charlie!

1102
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,873
Didn't I tell you to stay?
Haven't you hurt me enough?

1103
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,673
Look what you're doing to me!
Get in here!

1104
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,870
Why are you doing this to me? Shut up!

1105
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,959
Come on in here, Charlie!
Come on into your bedroom, Charlie!

1106
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,471
Lulu!

1107
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,955
Stop it, Ray! Stop it!

1108
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,758
Charlie, are you OK?

1109
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,718
Charlie!

1110
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,070
- I hate you!
- I hate you too!

1111
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,196
- Lulu!
- Charlie!

1112
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,074
Charlie, come here! I got somethin' for ya!

1113
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,590
Why can't you just give me a chance?
Why?! Why?!

1114
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,955
Stop it! Stop it!

1115
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,550
No, no...

1116
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,913
Oh... Oh, God!

1117
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:28,989
Ray!

1118
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,076
No! No!

1119
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,316
No!

1120
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:41,431
I hate you so much! Stop it!

1121
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:43,349
Charlie!

1122
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,595
No, Ray!

1123
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,915
Shit, Charlie.

1124
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,796
I understand that the break-in
occurred an hour ago.

1125
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,876
- Yeah.
- Keys.

1126
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,756
He smashed a window to gain entrance

1127
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,271
and you were forcibly led into the house,
Mr Driggs, through the back.

1128
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,790
I understand that he manacled you
at that time.

1129
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,070
Mr Driggs, did you know him?

1130
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,596
Did you know the guy?

1131
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,435
He was my husband.

1132
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,437
Your husband?

1133
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,391
Ray Sinclair.

1134
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,670
And what is <i>your</i> name?

1135
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,358
Audrey.

1136
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:56,194
Audrey, you wanna
come with me, please?

1137
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,638
Wait.

1138
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,799
You're not...
You're not taking her away because...

1139
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,198
It's all right. It's OK, Mr Driggs.
We just need to get more information.

1140
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,556
Charles?

1141
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,598
Larry!

1142
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,551
Hi.

1143
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,796
Listen, uh...

1144
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:17,150
We're all real sorry about your leaving.

1145
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,793
Oh, that's nice.

1146
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,115
There's no way to get you
to change your mind?

1147
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,913
No. Nope, I don't think so, no.

1148
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:28,269
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. Everything's been taken care of.

1149
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,356
Everything's fine.

1150
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,672
Well...

1151
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,399
Hey!

1152
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,588
How do you figure
a guy like Ray Sinclair?

1153
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,757
Well...

1154
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,996
Stay in touch. Promise?

1155
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,759
Promise.

1156
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,878
Hey, Larry.

1157
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,673
It's better to be a live dog
than a dead lion.

1158
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,440
It's been good working with you, Charlie.

1159
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,276
# <i>Ooh, yeah</i>

1160
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,034
# <i>You don't have to cry, girl</i>

1161
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,034
# <i>As I look out my window</i>

1162
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,435
# <i>I don't understand what I see</i>

1163
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,480
# <i>Once again we are letting it happen</i>

1164
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,520
# <i>Everywhere, fighting in the streets</i>

1165
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:40,393
# <i>How can people be dying from hunger?</i>

1166
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:43,318
# <i>How can they be dying for gasoline?</i>

1167
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,795
# <i>Come here, my child,</i>
<i>hold me for a moment</i>

1168
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,912
# <i>Your eyes are too young</i>

1169
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:53,079

- # <i>Oh, you don't have to cry, girl</i>

1170
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,236
Who is it?

1171
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,958
I'm looking for the woman in 3F.
Lulu is her name, or Audrey.

1172
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,672
I'm in 3F. You must want
the girl that moved out.

1173
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,439
Uh... did you talk to her?
I mean, did she say...

1174
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,155
Did she say where she was goin',
or a forwarding address or anything?

1175
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,589
No. I moved in, it was empty.

1176
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,676
OK, thanks.

1177
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:20,110
- Hey!
- Yeah?

1178
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:24,153
- Do you know what her rent was?
- Her rent?

1179
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:28,910
Yeah. This building is rent-stabilised,
but I think the landlord is screwing me.

1180
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,875
Yeah, well, it wouldn't surprise me.

1181
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,113
# <i>Oh, you don't have to cry, girl</i>

1182
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:40,073
# <i>I'm here to dry your eyes, girl</i>

1183
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:43,112
# <i>Here to dry your eyes, girl</i>

1184
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,674
# <i>You don't have to cry, girl</i>

1185
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:48,553
# <i>Oh, you don't have to worry any more</i>

1186
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:51,558
# <i>I'm here to dry your eyes, girl</i>

1187
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:55,673
# <i>We are stronger together,</i>
<i>that's for sure</i>

1188
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,753
# <i>Ooh, yeah</i>

1189
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,193
The MP would grab 'em
and confiscate 'em,

1190
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,118
and I'd take 'em back
and I'd sell 'em again.

1191
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,474
- Here's your check, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

1192
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,869
Hey! You didn't pay for your food.
Where you think you're goin'?

1193
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,475
- Come on, mister. I haven't got all day.
- What?

1194
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:04,912
- You didn't pay for your food.
- Sure I paid, Dottie. I put $5 on the table.

1195
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,598
Do you think I'm stupid?

1196
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:11,111
Look, it's a mistake. It was a $3.15 bill,
I left $5 on the table. That's a healthy tip.

1197
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:15,950
- Do you expect to eat and not pay?
- All right. It's not that big a deal to me.

1198
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,149
- Keep the, uh... keep the change.
- Sure.

1199
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,835
You never said goodbye.

1200
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:54,715
I never wanted to say goodbye.

1201
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,716
Want a ride?

1202
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,231
Sure, Audrey.

1203
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,112
Why not?

1204
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,678
# Oh-hoh!

1205
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:25,917
# Right!

1206
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,231
# Oh-hoh!

1207
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:29,918
# Rip it

1208
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,395
# Come shout and sing, join in the ring

1209

# It could be queen or it could be king

1210
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,756
# You go your way and I'll go mine

1211
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,950
# As long as you just make it fine

1212
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,071
# Come rain or shine, some drinkin' wine

1213
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,111
# Some even dressed like Frankenstein

1214
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,310
# Move up your waist, your bodyline

1215
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,749
# But just you do it right on time

1216
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:50,189
# Wild thing, oh-oh!

1217
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,670
# It is a wild thing

1218
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:58,115

# Lord

1222
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,237
# Crazy colours in your hair

1223
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,396
# Those funky shoes you always wear

1224
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,590
# The things you got you can't even share

1225
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,756
# Complaining that you're on welfare

1226
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,950
# Stay with the beat and move your feet

1227
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,877
# And do it till you feel the heat

1228
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,035
# Oh!

1229
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,394
# Come on, come, on, wild thing

# Do it, y'all, shake it
