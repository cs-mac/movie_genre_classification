1
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:18,293
Is my older brother,

2
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:26,693
Han Gi Tak? I know it
doesn't make sense but,

3
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:32,672
lately I keep having similar dreams.

4
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:34,803
With his big hands,

5
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:40,613
there was someone teaching me how to jab.

6
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:45,043
Can you explain it more?

7
00:00:46,753 --> 00:00:52,853
When I heard the name Han Gi
Tak, tear sprung to my eye.

8
00:00:54,093 --> 00:01:00,092
When I saw this, it was as if the pieces
of the puzzle was coming together.

9
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:05,463
But if you are that
person's younger sibling,

10
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:11,913
then could it be just my fantasy after
hearing about your older brother?

11
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:20,653
I lived using your name.

12
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:28,033
Because he wanted to see you,

13
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:35,633
your brother gave me that name.

14
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,023
Hong Nan...

15
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:45,783
That's my name?

16
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,263
Han Hong Nan.

17
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,583
Calling me Hong Nan,

18
00:01:55,693 --> 00:02:00,213
he raised me like a real sibling.

19
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:04,013
He never forgot about you.

20
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:07,963
You...

21
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:17,989
But, after this moment, don't
say that name out loud.

22
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:22,213
Han Hong Nan and Han Gi Tak.

23
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:24,452
Could it be...

24
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,162
♪ <i>It was as if the sun was covering you </i>♪

25
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:31,153
That my older brother, like
everybody's been saying,

26
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:37,553
he died that way?

27
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:39,532
Da Hye.

28
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:44,162
Your brother, remember him
as you see in this picture.

29
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,302
He would want you to.

30
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:49,802
You not living as Hong Nan.

31
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,533
He would want you to live as Da Hye.

32
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:59,133
This is all that I can tell you.

33
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,622
<i>Final Episode</i> You were
really surprised right?

34
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:26,532
I feel like everyone I love are in misery.

35
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,843
This is why I couldn't tell you.

36
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,513
The one who found your older brother,

37
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:35,333
is Jeong Ji Hoon.

38
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:41,822
- What?-It seems like he's been
looking for your family for a while.

39
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:49,312
On the day Kim Yeong Soo died, that's why he met
you at Big Wolf. Han Gi Tak was the chef there.

40
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,332
Jeong Ji Hoon did?

41
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:56,502
To you, who lost your husband, he couldn't
tell you about your older brother.

42
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,403
You are someone who went through
harder times than any other person.

43
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:06,483
That isn't your fault. Everyone is worried.

44
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:12,592
I don't think I have the right to say this
to you, seeing as how you rejected me.

45
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,633
It's laughable, but the
words I want to say...

46
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,623
is that you are a woman who
received a lot of love.

47
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:25,512
So don't think stupid thoughts.

48
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:29,092
I lost my husband and older brother.

49
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,983
Weirdly I'm not going crazy over it.

50
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:37,103
I think I can put up with it
because of the love I received.

51
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,593
Could you please not look at me like that.

52
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:52,752
With the look that you know everything.
Exactly what are you, Lee Hae Joon?

53
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:55,552
A friendly person staying at your house.

54
00:04:55,553 --> 00:05:00,623
I am leaving the day
after tomorrow, Ahjumma.

55
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:22,252
Why? Did you come to congratulate me?

56
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,602
You should have at least
brought cake and some flowers.

57
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:27,442
You too...

58
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:34,212
If you met another person instead of
me, would you have been more happy?

59
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:36,623
We're both killing each other.

60
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:42,083
No matter how much we hurt, it won't be
as much as someone who's already dead.

61
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:45,952
It's just so hard now.

62
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:48,212
Let's just end it here.

63
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:48,893
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:52,352
Let's cut ties and live well.

65
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:56,282
After I settle matters here, I'm going
to that Yong Chan and go far away.

66
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:58,283
I came here to tell you that.

67
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:22,443
Branch Manager.

68
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:32,112
Branch Manager... no, CEO,

69
00:06:32,113 --> 00:06:36,112
You look really, really,
really, really handsome today.

70
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:36,963
Department Head Ma.

71
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:40,989
You calling my name like that
makes me feel fluttered.

72
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:45,413
If I do weird things from
now on, please understand.

73
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:49,532
Differently than the other
Branch Managers, you constantly

74
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:52,012
did do some extremely weird things though.

75
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,472
Let's embrace each other.

76
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:56,243
-What?-Come now.

77
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,573
It's my first time so it may be awkward.

78
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,832
Oh my. Does this mean, I'm
in Lee Hae Joon's line?

79
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,863
Is it confirmed?

80
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,952
Why are we day drinking?

81
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:35,822
When will I experience the taste
of soju with you guys again?

82
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:41,289
When I go back to America, I won't
be able to taste it for a long time.

83
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:45,512
I'm sad. You're starting
to say those things again.

84
00:07:45,513 --> 00:07:49,942
Is there no soju in America?

85
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:50,863
You're leaving?

86
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:55,782
I only came here on vacation briefly. Since
I played around a lot, I need to go back.

87
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:59,262
You can just play with us.

88
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:03,082
Protect the restaurant well
between the two of you.

89
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,812
Don't ruin the Big Wolf
that we finally got back.

90
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:11,289
Especially you.

91
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:15,613
Stop scolding the kids and you
practice your cooking, okay?

92
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,563
Okay!

93
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:24,173
Seung Jae, take care of Yi Yeon.

94
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:33,332
I'll be the one to protect Song Yi
Yeon and Big Wolf, so don't worry.

95
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,422
And the meat soup for our Hyungnim,

96
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:42,842
I am in charge of it, so don't
worry about that either.

97
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:46,623
Alright, you're reliable.

98
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:52,022
Wait a little longer.

99
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:56,172
Before you leave, I will catch Na
Seok Chul and get him locked up.

100
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:56,963
Seung Jae.

101
00:08:56,964 --> 00:09:01,202
I know how he moves, I'm close.

102
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:05,322
- So...-That's not what
Han Gi Tak would want.

103
00:09:05,323 --> 00:09:10,683
The revenge you want, he would
never want you to do that.

She nagged at us a lot today and left.

106
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:39,802
Should we try it again?

107
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:42,263
Yes, let's go.

108
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:46,712
That's great, Yi Yeon. A little bit more.

109
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:50,703
Okay! Good!

110
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:58,512
That's right,

111
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:01,232
you'll do well on your own.

This is so freaking annoying.

Hey you, am I not allowed to
kill Han Gi Tak or something?

124

I killed him because there
was a reason to kill him!

Get rid of this bastard.

So annoying.

Should we get rid of Han
Gi Tak's sister too?

128
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:37,882
Yeah, we should let her go on the
rooftop and send her with brother.

00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:56,492
If I hit you that hard, the least you
could've done is visit me, isn't it?

162
00:15:56,493 --> 00:16:00,062
You're startling the one who did it.

163
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:01,432
Na Seok Cheol!

164
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:05,032
Hurry and bring the secret bank code.

165
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:08,273
The sister of Han Gi Tak
that you care so much about,

166
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:14,793
If you want to see her live. Got it?

167
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:42,393
Hello?!

168
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:44,802
Da Hye is with Na Seok Cheol!

169
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,862
- What?- This brat...
knows about our secret.

170
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:51,072
No! He can't know that Da
Hye is my little sister.

171
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:54,102
Then what do you want me to do?
Leave them be?!

172
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:58,513
No! It's my fault, I'll take care of it.

173
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:50,502
I lived under your name.
Because he missed you,

174
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:55,163
your brother gave me that name.

175
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,423
Oppa...

176
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:16,363
Clean out slowly. We have lots of time.

177
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:34,263
Seung Jae...

178
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:50,403
Seung Jae! Keep it together! Did
Na Seok Cheol do this to you?

179
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:59,003
How long have you been like this?!

180
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:03,632
I told you... yesterday.

181
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,672
You brat!

182
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:10,292
I told you not to!

183
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:13,773
Go.

184
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:17,392
Seung Jae!

185
00:19:17,393 --> 00:19:19,922
Help!

186
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:24,103
Excuse me! Call 911 please!

187
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:31,273
Seung Jae! Wake up! Choi Seung Jae!!

188
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:37,733
You packed everything up, I see.

189
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,442
Do you want to ride my car? I
have something to tell you.

190
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:49,123
It's fine. It's late, I'll leave.

191
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:53,002
I really don't like repeating myself.

192
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,382
What are you doing?

193
00:19:55,383 --> 00:20:01,043
What do you think?

194
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:22,152
<i>Han Na's father... Yeong Soo...</i>

195
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,763
<i>Don't!</i>

196
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:28,433
Manager...

197
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:36,462
You're finally here!

198
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:37,642
Are you okay?

199
00:20:37,643 --> 00:20:40,182
But, you Branch Manager.
Did you come empty handed?

200
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:41,962
Na Seok Cheol!

201
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:44,392
Do you want to go to hell?!

202
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:48,752
Yes, I want to go to hell
so I'm living like this.

203
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:50,813
Come here.

204
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:59,393
I won't die. I won't die. I won't
die because I've already died once.

205
00:21:09,363 --> 00:21:11,003
Come here!

206
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:14,143
Come here!

207
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:36,843
Come here, I said!

208
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:49,643
This brat.

209
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:58,362
Where is the secret bank code?! I don't
have time to plaay with you like this!

210
00:21:58,363 --> 00:22:03,352
I'm the one who has the
least amount of time.

211
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:08,422
I'm the one who worked for 15
years under a crappy company!

212
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:12,483
You really don't get what I'm saying.

213
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:30,563
I don't know about anything else,
but I will protect Da Hye.

214
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:33,242
Try and protect her.

215
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:36,482
No! No! Please don't!

216
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:40,132
Don't touch Da Hye!

217
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:43,213
This bastard, really...

218
00:22:48,023 --> 00:22:50,313
It came out well.

219
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:58,772
Hong Nan...

220
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:03,652
<i>Let's see each other, I'm leaving soon.</i>

221
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:07,703
<i>Noonim, sister said she was
going to go back to America.</i>

222
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:18,743
<i>How would I die, leaving
you alone, Song Yi Yeon.</i>

223
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:30,313
<i>He doesn't resent you. He never has.</i>

224
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:36,472
<i>Meet a good person.</i>

225
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:41,793
<i>Like a friend, like family, someone
that can be there for you like that.</i>

226
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:05,733
Where is the secret bank code?!

227
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:17,752
You cute pair. I should eat both of you.

228
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:19,893
<i>Na Seok Cheol!!</i>

229
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:25,272
Isn't that what you want?

230
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:30,322
Yes! That's it!

231
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:31,822
Give it to oppa.

232
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:33,922
Are you okay?

233
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:36,372
I'm okay.

234
00:24:36,373 --> 00:24:38,542
Don't cry.

235
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,502
Give it. Hurry and give it to me.

236
00:24:41,503 --> 00:24:45,742
You, is living like this worth it to you?

237
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:47,932
Yeah. It's worth living.

238
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:51,172
Thus, pretty, give it me.

239
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:54,713
You try and come get it.

240
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:26,652
How much people are you going to kill?
Wasn't Han Gi Tak enough?

241
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:31,642
Big Hyungnim, Seung Jae, and now even them. Are you
going to kill all of them just for that money?

242
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:33,812
What's wrong with money?

243
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:37,532
Do I have to lose to Han
Gi Tak my whole life?

244
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:40,622
He should be thankful to
Song Yi Yeon's father.

245
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:46,972
Because he made the person that my face
like this linger around all this time.

246
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:48,132
What are you saying?

247
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:51,362
He's been following me
around my whole life.

248
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:56,443
Just blocking up my way. That's Han Gi Tak!

249
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:10,802
- Don't!- Let's stop now.

250
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:14,313
No!

251
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,243
Don't do it!

252
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:23,813
It's mine!

253
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:30,523
No!

254
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:37,022
Save me! Save me!

255
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:38,872
This crazy...

256
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:40,442
No! Let go of his hand!

257
00:26:40,443 --> 00:26:45,842
Don't! I was wrong! I did bad things!

258
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:49,602
Yeah, let's stop now... Seok Cheol.

259
00:26:49,603 --> 00:26:52,873
No! Let go of his hand!

260
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:57,983
Be happy.

261
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:01,902
The people I love.

262
00:27:01,903 --> 00:27:04,752
Don't! You can't leave me!

263
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:09,052
My sister, until the last moment,

264
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:12,903
I leave her to you, Brother-in-law.

265
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:17,833
Don't be like this! No!

266
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:25,533
<i>Bye, you quack.</i>

267
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,563
Oppa...

268
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,532
No!

269

No! Please...

270
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:43,202
Don't go! Please!

271
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,113
No!

272
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:17,623

Yes, you worked hard.

321

<i>I told you if you cry everywhere, you're the Ugly One,
right? If someone makes fun of you, what do you do?</i>

322
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:27,322
<i>One two, one two!</i>

323
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:29,103
<i>That's right.</i>

324
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,223
<i>That's right, my dongsaeng.</i>

325
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:44,912
Han Gi Tak's memories disappeared.

326
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:51,023
I will... I will remember those moments.

327
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:12,592
Ahjumma, are you okay?

328
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:14,112
Manager.

329
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,292
Huh?

330
00:35:16,293 --> 00:35:18,152
Hae Joon...

331
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:19,643
Yes.

332
00:35:25,183 --> 00:35:27,873
Why are you looking at me like that?

333
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,753
I was glad to meet you.

334
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:44,912
How is it? It's warm, right?

335
00:35:44,913 --> 00:35:47,802
Ahjussi, this is quite...

336
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:50,242
Winter is in a long time.

337
00:35:50,243 --> 00:35:52,703
Hey! What are you saying.

338
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:57,773
Here, this is Han Na's first bra!

339
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:06,862
And this is perfume, rose and, kiss...

340
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:11,692
Kiss? If you get a boyfriend,

341
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:14,032
tell it to mom and grandpa.

342
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:18,782
And you have to make sure it's
someone as good as your dad, okay?

343
00:36:18,783 --> 00:36:23,472
Yes, yes. But, what is this one?

344
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,343
You're not giving it to me?

345
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:43,533
This is a tiara. This is what
brides wear for their wedding.

346
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:49,793
Your dad would have liked it if he
saw you wearing a wedding dress.

347
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:59,472
I'm going to marry you.

When I first got married, the
me who didn't know how to cook,

only made curry every day.

377

Even after eating curry for 365
days, he never complained once.

378

After that person left, it's

if we never saw each other again.

If we see each other by chance, let's
pretend that we don't know each other.

382

It's a relief though that there will be

He left coolly right?

Refusing the train to heaven, was
there a purpose to your return?

Of course! If I didn't come back,

I wonder. I don't know when it started but

437
00:47:57,393 --> 00:48:00,132
from somebody

438
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:04,393

My son. Mommy really really misses you.

eat it then of course Mommy has to buy that.

467
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:29,202
Because the Branch Manager hurt his
head on a hit and run accident,

468
00:50:29,203 --> 00:50:33,202
even if he does strange things,
let's be his warm co-workers.

469
00:50:33,203 --> 00:50:36,213
-Understand?-Yes!

470
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:40,772
<i>Please distribute my shares
equally to the employees.</i>

471
00:50:40,773 --> 00:50:42,462
<i>Are you sincere?</i>

472
00:50:42,463 --> 00:50:45,722
<i>I told you.</i>

473
00:50:45,723 --> 00:50:46,872
What about the management rights...

474
00:50:46,873 --> 00:50:52,872
The managing just needs someone who can manage well, and
regardless of who, they are still company employee.

475
00:50:52,873 --> 00:50:56,753
See that they don't make decisions
without the consent of the employees.

476
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:04,263
<i>To: Lee Hae Joon</i>

477
00:51:17,113 --> 00:51:23,702
<i>If you are reading this letter then
that means that I have left this world.</i>

478
00:51:23,703 --> 00:51:27,162
<i>For the past two months, just like you have
experienced those ordeals like a dream,</i>

479
00:51:27,163 --> 00:51:33,352
<i>I too, experienced a dream like
time here borrowing your name.</i>

480
00:51:33,353 --> 00:51:39,182
<i>In order to protect this department
store, I ruined your plan.</i>

481
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:42,133
<i>But I don't want to apologize.</i>

482
00:51:42,943 --> 00:51:45,842
<i>In exchange for bringing up this
department store from the bottom,</i>

483
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:51,402
Would it be selfish of me to say that I gifted
you employees that love and care for you?

484
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:57,262
<i>Rather than living for revenge, I
hope that you live for happiness.</i>

485
00:51:57,263 --> 00:52:01,003
<i>From: A friend that looks like your twin.</i>

486
00:52:02,693 --> 00:52:06,592
"You're fired from the company, what
are you doing here?" is what he says.

487
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:09,212
How our Manager Lee is handling
the proxy president role...

488
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:12,652
I was curious as to whether or not
protecting the Chairman spot well.

489
00:52:12,653 --> 00:52:16,022
Also, my aging father,

490
00:52:16,023 --> 00:52:20,362
I pity seeing him tidying
up the president's messes.

491
00:52:20,363 --> 00:52:22,902
I wanted to be of some help.

492
00:52:22,903 --> 00:52:25,912
What do you want to do,
Chairman, Lee Hae Joon?

493
00:52:25,913 --> 00:52:31,163
Although I did resent you
to death, and I still do...

494
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:36,743
Hyung.

495
00:52:38,493 --> 00:52:40,233
Hyung?!

496
00:52:41,273 --> 00:52:43,203
Also, Father.

497
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:48,442
What the hell?

498
00:52:48,443 --> 00:52:51,632
I want to call you that at least once.

499
00:52:51,633 --> 00:52:56,412
Before I die, at least once,
I want to call you that.

500
00:52:56,413 --> 00:53:00,993
Father, and Hyung too.

501
00:53:11,023 --> 00:53:13,053
I don't know!

502
00:53:14,193 --> 00:53:16,512
I don't know what he is trying to say!

503
00:53:16,513 --> 00:53:19,212
Until when do I have to keep doing this?!

504
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:22,292
Please, have a conversation!

505
00:53:22,293 --> 00:53:24,533
Talk, please!

506
00:53:46,113 --> 00:53:50,762
Stop it. Living once with you is enough.

507
00:53:50,763 --> 00:53:56,033
Let's go eat. I have a
lot of free time lately.

508
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:04,763
You said you wanted me to act more like a Dad. If I don't do
it now when I have a lot of free time, when will I ever do it?

509
00:54:05,973 --> 00:54:09,163
Since when were you that considerate?

510
00:54:12,143 --> 00:54:16,483
Cha Yeong Chan! Don't go too far away!

511
00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:22,343
Thank you.

512
00:54:24,983 --> 00:54:29,582
Do you know how much I like your dad?

513
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:33,863
We have some similarities
so it makes me happy.

514
00:54:34,883 --> 00:54:40,262
Your dad was a very successful person.
You can be proud of him.

515
00:54:40,263 --> 00:54:42,532
I wanted to tell you that so I came here.

516
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:44,762
- Ahjussi...- Yes?

517
00:54:44,763 --> 00:54:49,092

518
