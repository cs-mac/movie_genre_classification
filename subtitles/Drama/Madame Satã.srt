<i>[This drama is based on psychology.
All cases and treatments are fictitious.]</i>

2
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:19,352
What color do you think these are?

3
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:25,551
Purple? No.
They're plum-colored.

4
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:29,352
And they signify eternal love.

5
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:34,951
I love you, Mr. Soo Hyun.

6
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:46,652
I'm different from your mother.
I'll never leave your side.

7
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:10,951
<i>[Final Episode]</i>

8
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:18,751
<i>Mr. Soo Hyun, go to your office.</i>

9
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:37,152
<i>[Soo Hyun is a bit rough around
the edges, but he's handsome.]</i>

10
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:38,952
<i>[Mr. Soo Hyun can be a bit
salty at times but he's a great cook.]</i>

11
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:40,751
<i>[Mr. Soo Hyun is a romantic guy who
shows me romantic movies when I'm sad.]</i>

12
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:43,251
<i>[Mr. Soo Hyun is a terrible writer but
he makes up for it with his voice.]</i>

13
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:10,951
<i>[Mr. Soo Hyun is the man that I love.]</i>

14
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,451
I came here to work on a project.

15
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:27,852
It's called the
Choi Soo Hyun Revitalization Project.

16
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:29,552
You'll help me out with it, right?

17
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:33,051
Do it for me, at least.
Please? Just eat a little bit.

18
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:38,751
You have an obligation to
repay me for my kindness.

19
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:44,451
I love you, Mr. Soo Hyun.
I won't ever leave your side.

20
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:49,251
You're going to give up
on your experiment?

21
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:53,131
Yes. I think it would prove difficult
to continue it at the moment.

22
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:54,437
I apologize.

23
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:57,236
You said something like
this before, too. Why-

24
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:02,386
What's the issue?
I'll take care of it for you.

25
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:05,937
It's not something that
you could help me with.

26
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:10,537
I think that there may be
an issue with my hypothesis.

27
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:17,236
The one that claims that women
aren't capable of true love?

28
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,037
Are you talking about that one?

29
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:21,837
Yes.

30
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:25,537
That would really overturn
the entire experiment!

31
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:27,337
What are we supposed to do now?

32
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:31,336
I've already budgeted out a
portion to invest into your research

33
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:32,636
and we've already begun
things with Marketing-

34
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:36,037
I'll do my best to offer my counsel as
a psychologist to the Marketing Team.

35
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:40,736
However, I'll have to put
a halt to the experiment for now.

36
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:50,637
<i>There a really, really low chance that
Dr. Choi will cancel the experiment.</i>

37
00:03:50,837 --> 00:03:55,136
Why? We've invested so much
money into this, though!

38
00:03:55,336 --> 00:04:01,437
I'm sorry, Chairman. But if he does that,
it'll be a breach of his contract, right?

39
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:04,137
How about dealing with the damage
control on a company-wide scale

40
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:08,636
and you give him a stiff talking-to?

41
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:12,336
For example, you can give him
a punishment, or something.

42
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:14,037
A punishment?

43
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:22,336
Just what have you planned?
What did you tell the Chairman?

44
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:24,537
What are you talking about?
I only got a call from him

45
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:28,137
asking me to counsel you
since you seem to be having issues.

46
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:33,836
That's my spot.
You're the patient, so sit over there.

47
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:49,637
How have you been feeling lately?

48
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:51,836
Just whatever.

49
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,636
Oh yeah. Something strange has happened.

50
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,836
I'm a psychologist, and the
the fortune teller from downstairs

51
00:04:57,036 --> 00:05:00,637
says she's going to counsel me.
Isn't that amusing?

52
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,836
And have you been sleeping well?

53
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,136
Yes.

54
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:08,137
Liar. You can't sleep
or eat well, can you?

55
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:10,037
I can have a glass of milk, at least.

56
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,937
Also, the patient is allowed
to lie as much as they'd like.

57
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,537
The work of the psychologist
is to catch those lies

58
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:16,636
and to figure out where the
issue lies within that, as well as

59
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:22,237
what kind of psychological scars they
may have, and help them accordingly.

60
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:24,537
I'll take care of that myself.

61
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:27,836
You don't even shed any tears
as of late, do you?

62
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:30,255
I don't really have anything
to be sad about.

63
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,536
Your mother came back.

64
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:38,537
Isn't it more strange
to be crying like a kid when I'm 36?

65
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:42,436
She's a mother who abandoned you
when you were just 6 years old.

66
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:46,136
And because of that, you've lost
your memories prior to that

67
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:49,137
and you still experience pain when
you're hit by droplets of liquid.

68
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:52,636
Crying when you're sad
and getting angry when you're angry...

69
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:55,636
expressing your emotions like this
is what normal people do.

70
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:59,937
Wouldn't it be a natural response for
you to cry if you'd met your mother?

71
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:07,336
The quantity of those tears, per se,
varies from person to person.

72
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:09,037
Also, a defense mechanism
may be in place.

73
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:11,136
Not all defense mechanisms
are inherently bad, you know.

74
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:14,336
I've transcended that through
delving into my psychological studies.

75
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:17,536
That's quite a desirable defense
mechanism, wouldn't you say?

76
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:21,987
You don't really
understand what I'm saying

77
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:23,937
because I'm using
specialized terms, right?

78
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:25,437
Just ask me questions freely.

79
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:28,937
If there's something that you're having
a hard time with, I'll help you out.

80
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:37,937
Maybe it's because I was in a rush,
but there's a lot of things I forgot.

81
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:39,237
Like my charger,
underwear, and socks.

82
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:42,437
I didn't bring my Rubic's cube,
so my hands feel unoccupied.

83
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:45,337
Can't we just go to the store
and buy all of those things?

84
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:48,237
We have to scrimp and save!
How could we buy all that?

85
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:53,836
Also, I bought a new camera this month
so I don't have much credit left.

86
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:57,336
Damn it... forget my clothes,
I need my charger! What do I do?

87
00:06:57,536 --> 00:06:58,537
Even if you don't take Hye Rim's calls

88
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:00,636
it'd be an issue if you
didn't take calls from work.

89
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:04,036
It's fine because I'm on vacation
right now, but still...

90
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:08,637
This won't do. I'll sneak in
and grab those things.

91
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:09,836
How?

92
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:36,536
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, um, hello.

93
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:49,737
What? She went into my place just now?
Got it. I'm going to go there and-

94
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:55,036
You can't. Do you think she'll tell you
if you catch her and ask where Ji Ho is?

95
00:07:55,236 --> 00:07:57,737
She'll act all down for a day
and then run off again.

96
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:00,137
Yeah.
What should I do, then?

97
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:26,137
<i>There's just one answer.
You have to tail her.</i>

98
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:37,336
Here. Here, too.

99
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,236
Yoo Rim, the nape of your neck
is so pretty.

100
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:48,437
I heard you said that you fell
for my sister for the same reason.

101
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:53,436
No. Hers has nothing on yours.
Seriously!

102
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:59,136
Really? It's my first time hearing that
I'm prettier than Hye Rim.

103
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:01,037
Thanks, my baby!

104
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:08,136
Aw... are you two having fun
playing house?

105
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,037
Hye Rim, how did you know-

106
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:18,437
You like it? You like living blissfully
ignorant to the realities of life?

107
00:09:18,637 --> 00:09:20,736
Geez!

108
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:35,937
Ji Ho. I got married when I was
exactly your age - 21.

109
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:40,336
But look. This is what's
in store for you two.

110
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,036
Do I look like I have a good life? Huh?

111
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:45,336
You did have a nice life. It's just
that your husband was a bastard.

112
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:49,636
It's partly my fault too
that my husband cheated on me.

113
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,336
We just got married because
we liked each other

114
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:52,436
but we didn't know each other
well at all.

115
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:55,136
So we fought about everything from the
way we squeeze toothpaste

116
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:56,537
to methods of cleaning
on the day after we got married-

117
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:58,636
We both squeeze the tube
from the bottom.

118
00:09:58,836 --> 00:09:59,936
- Right, Ji Ho?
- Yes.

119
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:03,437
- But, as for cleaning...
- We can't do it every day.

120
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:04,937
Once every three days.
Okay?

121
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:05,737
Okay.

122
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:10,036
See?
What kind of life will you two live?

123
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:12,537
If you keep doing things your way
and Ji Ho eventually explodes-

124
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,287
I'm not a volcano.
I won't explode.

125
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:15,837
I've trained him well,
so don't worry.

126
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:20,836
Also, as you know, he's like a doormat.
I can just walk all over him.

127
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:25,336
Fine. Let's just say
that I let you guys get married.

128
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:26,737
How are you going to
get a place to live?

129
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,636
We'll just look for a place that
takes monthly rent.

130
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,437
Even the smallest apartments nowadays
go for about 700,000 won per month.

131
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,436
Can you handle that kind of rent?

132
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:35,836
More importantly, how are you
going to sleep in that small room?

133
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,336
We'll hold onto each other tight
and sleep like that!

134
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,537
Any other issues?
Bring them on!

135
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:46,336
Fine. Let's cut off contact
from now on, then.

136
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:50,136
What? Why are you
saying that all of a sudden?

137
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:53,236
I tried so hard to keep you
from suffering the same fate I did

138
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:55,536
but you're being like this,
so whatever.

139
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:57,636
Let's not see each other from now on.

140
00:10:57,836 --> 00:11:02,537
From now on, you and I
are strangers. Bye bye. Okay?

141
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:06,136
I'm pregnant!

142
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,936
To tell you the truth,
I wasn't going to bring this up

143
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:20,136
but I have a kid inside me now.
So I have to marry him, ASAP.

144
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:24,337
Yoo Rim... really?

145
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,236
You'll congratulate me, right?

146
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:33,337
Are you out of your damn mind? Huh?

147
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:36,037
How could you be beating
a pregnant woman?

148
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:41,736
What the hell did you do, huh?
This young punk...

149
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,136
How dare you!
How dare you!

150
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,837
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

151
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,636
He didn't do anything wrong!
Hit me instead!

152
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:54,736
Yeah, have a fantastic life
on your own, both of you!

153
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:57,933
Hye Rim!

154
00:11:57,937 --> 00:12:01,736
Yoo Rim, is that true?
Are you really pregnant with my-

155
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:03,336
Are you out of your mind?
That was a total lie.

156
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:04,437
Hye Rim!

157
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:10,837
Hye Rim! I'm sorry!
It's all my fault!

158
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:14,036
Don't run, you idiot!
What if you do something to the child?

159
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:17,536
Hye Rim, I promise we'll be happy.
Please don't be opposed to it, and-

160
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:21,037
First things first, come back home.
Let's talk when you come back.

161
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:41,636
Doctor.
Here are the materials.

162
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,037
Ah yes, thank you.

163
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:53,737
Doctor. My friend got a stomach ulcer.

164
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:58,937
But this friend really hates hospitals.
They ate healthy food and exercised

165
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:01,537
and when they got a check-up at
the hospital about a year later

166
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,037
everything apparently got better!

167
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:09,336
So you think that I'll
get better like that, too?

168
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:13,937
Do you think that ulcers and
cancer are on the same scale?

169
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:18,337
At any rate, they're both illnesses.

170
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:23,037
So Doctor, even if you won't get surgery,
please go get a check-up!

171
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,837
You've lived your life with
an optimistic mindset up until now

172
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:30,836
so there's a chance of the cancer
getting a bit better, too. Right?

173
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:40,736
All right. Let me personally
show you what my condition is like.

174
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:54,937
It's not good. According to this,
the cancer has spread to your liver.

175
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:55,737
What?

176
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:58,336
Radioactive treatment wouldn't
suffice at this point.

177
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:01,036
She'd have to undergo chemotherapy, too.

178
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:03,536
And of course, surgery would be a must.

179
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:07,136
What are the chances of her
making a complete recovery?

180
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:11,537
About 30 percent.

181
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:20,236
Doctor. Even so, you still have a better
chance of making a complete recovery

182
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:22,837
than you would have
with other types of cancers.

183
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:27,236
Please have the surgery and
undergo the treatment. Please?

184
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:31,436
Thyroid cancer treatments
usually take ten years or so.

185
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:39,136
I definitely won't be able to
complete my bucket list at that age.

186
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:45,136
I'm going to enjoy my life
while I still have the strength to do so

187
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:48,036
and complete my bucket list.

188
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:57,736
I don't want to waste away
in a hospital for ten years.

189
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:12,837
<i>Don't tell the people at the center
about my condition, no matter what.</i>

190
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:19,136
<i>If there's even rumors about it floating
around, I'll go back to Jeju Island.</i>

191
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:30,636
Seung Chan. I... wait, what's wrong?
Did something happen?

192
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:34,837
It's nothing.
What's up?

193
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:38,937
Is it okay if I
come over for a bit today?

194
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:39,936
Why?

195
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:42,236
I'm going to mimic Choi Soo Hyun.

196
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,636
You're sure that he's
coming home late today, right?

197
00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:49,437
Yeah, he said that he was having
dinner with some professors.

198
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:51,436
But why?
What are you looking for?

199
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:53,936
Things like the photo of Mr. Soo Hyun
that you gave me last time.

200
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:57,836
If it's anything that'll shed light
on his psychological scars, it'll do.

201
00:15:57,886 --> 00:16:01,111
Does he have any toys he used
to play with as a child, or an album?

202
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:04,537
I don't know. I think he threw those
all away when he moved here.

203
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:07,886
Wait, no. I think my mom
brought an album over here.

204
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:11,236
Why, should I ask her to
bring some over when she comes?

205
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:12,736
Your mother is coming here?

206
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:13,636
Yeah, with my father.

207
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:16,136
They're coming for a bit because
a relative is getting married.

208
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:18,636
Then, do you have anything else
besides albums?

209
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:22,836
I'm not sure. Something that will shed
light on the workings of his mind...

210
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:24,336
Maybe there's something here?

211
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:48,037
What, is anything helping?

212
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,836
Yeah. It's something in a different
direction than I'd expected

213
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:53,136
but I did find something.

214
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:12,736
<i>[The Ethics and Symbols
of Shamanism]</i>

215
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:15,037
<i>[Between Frigidity and Passion]</i>

216
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:25,936
<i>[Credit Card Receipt
Purchased: Necklace]</i>

217
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:34,136
<i>[Past searches: "past loves,"
"Sociology," "Jerome Bruner"]</i>

218
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:42,136
What's this?

219
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:43,837
It's a box, isn't it?

220
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,537
It's something that was inside
of your closet.

221
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:47,237
They're your things from when you
were an undergrad, right?

222
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:49,336
Did you go snooping around my room?

223
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,436
Just answer my question.

224
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,037
Why did you suddenly look through your
things from when you attended Stanford?

225
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:56,037
Were you thinking about
Clare, by any chance?

226
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:57,337
That's-

227
00:17:57,537 --> 00:18:00,037
And what's this? You bought a necklace
at a luxury retail shop, right?

228
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:02,636
And that was when I was
away in Daejeon, too.

229
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:05,236
Why did you buy that?
Who was it for?

230
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:08,037
- Ms. Hye Rim.
- And these books, about past love!

231
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:09,337
And your searches, about past love!

232
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:11,737
Why are you thinking so much
about past loves, all of a sudden?

233
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:12,537
It's because of Clare, right?

234
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:16,936
She came back, which is why you're
looking at and reading these things!

235
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:22,037
Can I talk now?

236
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,737
Go ahead and try.
I'm sure they'll just be excuses.

237
00:18:28,336 --> 00:18:31,537
It's true that I opened this box because
there was something I was looking for.

238
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:34,736
I wanted to make you
the omelet that you liked.

239
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:39,037
I had a recipe from a roommate who
was great at cooking, which was in here.

240
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:40,636
Don't believe me?

241
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:43,436
Shall I make you one exactly
according to that recipe right now?

242
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:46,337
Then what about that photo
that you took with Clare?

243
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:51,336
Clare's photo was in there? You
should've thrown it away. It's useless.

244
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:56,436
As for this necklace,
I did buy it to give to a woman.

245
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,737
And I already gave it to her.

246
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:58,636
Who, Clare?

247
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:01,836
- I gave it to Hye Rim.
- Are you messing with me?

248
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:03,736
Hye Rim, the Pomeranian that I have.

249
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,836
You said you went in my room
but you didn't see it?

250
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:07,836
She had a necklace on her.

251
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:17,737
As for this, I was reading it
because of a patient that I have.

252
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:19,836
I have a female patient
who's going through a hard time

253
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:21,636
because she was
dumped by her boyfriend

254
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:24,286
and she kept referencing this book
during our sessions

255
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:26,936
so I read it to try and get
a better understanding.

256
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:33,136
I guess you didn't see the book on
shamanism next to this one, though.

257
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:35,237
I was reading that book
because of you.

258
00:19:36,936 --> 00:19:40,737
End of explanation. You're cleared
of your misunderstandings now, right?

259
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:56,037
Mr. Seung Chan,
please get me some plane tickets.

260
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,636
- Okay.
- You didn't ask where I was going.

261
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:02,636
- Where are you going?
- Alaska.

262
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:06,037
I'm going to leave in three weeks
to check that off my bucket list.

263
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:07,936
Oh... okay.

264
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:12,936
Wait. You don't have
anything else to ask me?

265
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,136
No, I don't.

266
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,836
Here's the itinerary.

267
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:30,436
Wait, it's this expensive?

268
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:32,737
Yes, since it's for two passengers.

269
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:36,836
I got tickets too,
so that I can come with you.

270
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,237
I can come with you, right?

271
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:46,037
Really? It'd be a big help
if you came with me.

272
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:51,636
But I did some research on Alaska.

273
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,737
This might be okay for me,
but I don't know about you.

274
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:55,537
Why?

275
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:58,736
Well firstly, you have to be
on the plane for 15 hours.

276
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:01,936
Will you be okay with that?
You have cancer, after all.

277
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:06,836
On top of that, we have to go to
Fairbanks if we want to see auroras.

278
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:08,936
But the sun barely ever rises
there in the wintertime.

279
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:09,936
It'll be night most of the time.

280
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:13,237
Also, the temperature can drop
to -24 degrees Celsius.

281
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:16,636
What are you trying to say?

282
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:18,936
On top of that, the weather
there is quite capricious.

283
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:23,737
There are windy storms, thunderstorms,
and even hail. It's seriously crazy.

284
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:28,537
Oh yeah. You said you wanted to see
Machu Picchu too, right?

285
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:30,736
But it's 2,400 meters
above sea level.

286
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:34,336
And yet, you have a hard time even
hiking up the hill right around here.

287
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:40,737
But there's a way you can
solve all of these problems.

288
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:42,837
I'm not getting surgery.

289
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:46,537
Doctor. There's a 30 percent chance
that you'll make a complete recovery!

290
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:49,336
It's not "just" 30 percent;
it's "30 whole percent!"

291
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:51,037
Why are you ignoring that?

292
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:53,636
It's my life.
It's my decision.

293
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:57,037
I don't want
to leave it up to statistics.

294
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:03,037
I'm going to Alaska in three weeks
to see the auroras, for sure.

295
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:07,136
Whether you come or not is up to you.

296
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:18,136
Please enjoy.

297
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:29,136
Come upstairs.

298
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:41,836
Drink it. It's tea that's good
for pregnant women's hormones.

299
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:43,337
Hye Rim, I'd like some water-

300
00:22:43,537 --> 00:22:45,037
You can have some damn water
at your own damn house.

301
00:22:45,237 --> 00:22:49,237
Also, why did you make Yoo Rim hold
the heavy luggage on the way in?

302
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:51,836
Don't you know how dangerous that
can be for a pregnant woman?

303
00:22:54,737 --> 00:22:56,436
How many months along are you?

304
00:22:56,636 --> 00:23:00,636
No, it probably hasn't been that long
yet. How many weeks along are you?

305
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:04,836
<i>What do I do? When should I tell her
that I'm not actually pregnant?</i>

306
00:23:05,737 --> 00:23:07,936
I bought milk, anchovies, and cheese.

307
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,336
The baby's bone structure is
forming right around now

308
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:11,837
so you need to eat a lot of calcium.

309
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:16,037
Drink water often, and have lots
of fruits and vegetables, too.

310
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:18,037
And don't do any
strenuous exercising, okay?

311
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:23,537
It's almost time.
Let's go.

312
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,936
Go where?

313
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:27,136
I made an appointment for you
at the OB/GYN.

314
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:27,936
What?

315
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:29,836
We have to find out if the child
is in the right position

316
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:31,537
and doesn't have any
issues thus far!

317
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:34,537
- Let's go.
- Wait.

318
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:36,586
It's only the beginning of my
pregnancy, so I'm sure I'll be fine.

319
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:38,436
It's more dangerous because you're
at the beginning of your pregnancy!

320
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:42,336
You have to see if the child is doing
well, and if their heart is beating well!

321
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:46,037
What are you doing, as the father
of the child? Hurry and get her up!

322
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,537
Geez. Get over here!

323
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:50,875
- Let's go!
- Hye Rim!

324
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:54,306
- Hurry up.
- No, no!

325
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:57,737
- Hye Rim!
- Stop it!

326
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:01,736
Ow, my stomach.

327
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,786
Oh my gosh,
is the baby okay?

328
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,836
I was slightly jabbed there.

329
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:08,636
Hurry up and call an ambulance!

330
00:24:09,537 --> 00:24:12,236
- Wait, you can't!
- This is 911, right?

331
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:14,136
Yes, we have a pregnant woman here,
and she fell down the stairs

332
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,836
- and hurt her stomach.
- I don't have one!

333
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:20,237
What don't you have?

334
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:23,936
A baby.
I'm not pregnant.

335
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:31,936
- What?
- I lied. I'm sorry.

336
00:24:41,336 --> 00:24:44,436
What's with me?
I keep laughing.

337
00:24:54,737 --> 00:24:58,436
What do I do?
I think she's gone crazy.

338
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:19,237
What's with your expression?

339
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:22,537
You're not happy to see your
father for the first time in a while?

340
00:25:32,737 --> 00:25:36,037
Give us two of the A Courses,
and... what do you want to eat?

341
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:37,537
The B Course.

342
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:48,037
Is work going well? I heard you're
making him work, too.

343
00:25:48,237 --> 00:25:51,836
You can't even take care of your younger
brother properly, as an older brother.

344
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:54,686
Isn't there a nicer place where
you can get him some work?

345
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,011
No, Father. I'm not ready
for something like that yet.

346
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:59,336
Since I spent all that money
to send you to study abroad

347
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:02,236
you should've done something greater.

348
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:07,136
But you're just some damn
counselor making pennies.

349
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:08,537
Is that what you should be doing?

350
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:14,337
You can't even answer me?
How frustrating.

351
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:17,037
It's probably because you
take after your damn mother.

352
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:21,436
What's with that smirk?

353
00:26:21,636 --> 00:26:24,936
You're still the same, acting however
you please because you're old.

354
00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:26,436
Soo Hyun!

355
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:31,336
You know that I can't eat oysters, and
yet you ordered an oyster dish for me?

356
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,636
Are you bragging about the fact that you
can't eat oysters, at your age?

357
00:26:33,836 --> 00:26:36,136
You should act your age
and stop being so picky!

358
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:41,737
I know, right? I'm plenty old enough,
so why are you treating me like a child?

359
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:45,136
How dare you talk back to me!

360
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:49,436
A counselor, huh? Why the hell do you
care how I make a living?

361
00:26:49,636 --> 00:26:52,036
Sending me to study abroad?
You never spent a single cent to help me.

362
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,636
Do you think you would've been able
to go if I hadn't allowed it?

363
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:57,336
I studied abroad with the
money that I earned on my own!

364
00:26:57,536 --> 00:26:59,537
You didn't do anything
to contribute to it!

365
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:01,537
"You?"

366
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:03,936
Why are you talking to Father like that?
It's been so long, too!

367
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:05,737
One needs to have traits one can learn
from to be a qualified father.

368
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:07,686
All you do is treat everyone else
as if they're below you

369
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:09,436
and show off your status
because you're a bit wealthy.

370
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:12,537
A person who has biases and
does whatever he pleases all the time...

371
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:16,037
wants to be treated as if he's
actually my father now?

372
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:16,837
You bastard!

373
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:19,337
Do you know why I went
to go study abroad?

374
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:24,337
I wanted to get as far away from you
as I could.

375
00:27:24,537 --> 00:27:26,537
I wasn't even laughing when I was
laughing. Why, you may ask?

376
00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:28,936
Because I only did it
since you pressured me to.

377
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:36,136
Eat a lot of delicious
things for lunch.

378
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:36,936
You'll have to live a long time

379
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:39,636
if you're going to satiate that
incredible greed of yours.

380
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:55,336
What the hell are you doing?

381
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:58,336
Do you really want to be saying
those things to Father

382
00:27:58,536 --> 00:27:59,661
who's getting weak in his old age?

383
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:00,787
This is between me and Father.

384
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:03,212
A guy like you, who was loved
throughout his childhood and

385
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:05,836
was allowed to do as he pleased
has no right to say this to me.

386
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:08,736
You're the one who pushed us away!

387
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:14,736
Father, sure. I don't know about him,
but Mom and I did our very best.

388
00:28:14,936 --> 00:28:19,936
We tried so hard to see how we could
get along with you and be good to you.

389
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:23,037
But who was the one who pushed
Mom and me away regardless?

390
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:24,436
It was you!

391
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,037
The fact that our family
became like this is your fault.

392
00:28:29,237 --> 00:28:30,936
It was all your fault.

393
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:56,636
<i>Soo Hyun, I'm sorry for everything.
What can I do to be forgiven by you?</i>

394
00:29:03,537 --> 00:29:07,537
That's right.
And don't ever come back.

395
00:29:24,737 --> 00:29:28,636
- Hello.
- Um, excuse me.

396
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:32,336
Is there any way you can tell me
where Ms. Seo Yeon Hui is staying?

397
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:34,836
Excuse me, but what's your
relationship with her?

398
00:29:45,737 --> 00:29:48,237
Never mind.
I found her.

399
00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:54,936
Hello?
Yes, my son.

400
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,136
I'm going to come back
after a couple of days.

401
00:29:58,336 --> 00:30:00,337
Have you been eating well?

402
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:04,936
Geez, you can't just live off
of instant food!

403
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,936
Eat that soup I already made for you.

404
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:08,936
Make sure you eat all of that, okay?

405
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:11,537
Is your studying for your
upcoming exam going well?

406
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:19,336
Oh my. That's great! So you just have
to hear back from one more place, right?

407
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:22,537
Oh, that's great, my son!

408
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,836
You got into two of the schools
that you wanted to go to!

409
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,037
All you have to do now
is choose among them!

410
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:33,136
What should I do about Mr. Soo Hyun?

411
00:30:33,336 --> 00:30:35,736
He's grumpy even if I'm good
to him, or try to cheer him up.

412
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:38,336
And if I try to get closer to him,
he wiggles out like a fish.

413
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,436
I don't know what else I can do for him.

414
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:42,337
I'm sure it will be difficult for you.

415
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:47,636
He's not your average guy,
and he's a psychologist too.

416
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:53,936
What he needs right now is a
reaffirmation of your affections.

417
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:57,136
A reaffirmation of my affections?

418
00:30:57,336 --> 00:31:03,936
Yes. Dr. Choi is treating his situation
as if it's happening to someone else.

419
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:07,873
He's saying to himself,
"I know the story. I know how it ends."

420
00:31:08,073 --> 00:31:09,771
And all the while,
he's analyzing the situation.

421
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:16,271
However, he won't reach an emotional
breakthrough with that kind of approach.

422
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:19,271
Then what can I do?

423
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:24,373
You have to drag Dr. Choi onto the stage
instead of letting him merely spectate.

424
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:26,173
As the main character.

425
00:31:58,373 --> 00:32:00,373
Where are we going?

426
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:02,356
We'll be doing our
consultation outdoors today.

427
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,957
Don't you know that you're only supposed
to have consultations once per week?

428
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:05,856
Also, why outside-

429
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:07,956
A consultation with a
fortune teller is a bit different.

430
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:11,855
I'm going to do it where it feels right,
for as long as it takes.

431
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,457
Until I get something out of you.

432
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:16,557
I guess you did quite a lot
of research on me.

433
00:32:16,757 --> 00:32:18,655
You even found the elementary school
I used to go to.

434
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:22,957
What kind of child were you
when you were attending school?

435
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:25,356
I was the same as all the other kids.

436
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:28,757
I ran around and ate well.
And played well.

437
00:32:33,257 --> 00:32:35,757
What about around this time?

438
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:47,957
<i>Soo Hyun. I wish you could
come and take me away.</i>

439
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:51,957
<i>I don't want to be here by myself.</i>

440
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:56,457
All right.
One, two-

441
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:02,056
Choi Soo Hyun! What's with that
expression, when we're taking a photo?

442
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:05,556
Did you get yelled at by someone?
Smile!

443
00:33:06,257 --> 00:33:07,957
I told you to smile!

444
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,855
All right.
One, two!

445
00:33:15,757 --> 00:33:19,457
<i>What's with your damn expression
when we're taking a photo?</i>

446
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:21,355
<i>Damn kid.</i>

447
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:24,957
Soo Hyun, why aren't you coming?

448
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:30,156
Go on ahead. I want to play here
a bit longer before I go.

449
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,457
Why would you play outside
in the middle of winter?

450
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:33,557
Just hurry up and come, punk!

451
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:39,056
I... I really... I really
just want to play here.

452
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:42,155
- Soo Hyun.
- Do whatever you want!

453
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:45,457
He takes after his mother,
so he does whatever he wants!

454
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:22,157
Go and console him.

455
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:28,757
The only one who can console that
child right now is you, Mr. Soo Hyun.

456
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:39,856
Doctor. When you go to Alaska,
which bag do you want to use?

457
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:44,056
- This one.
- Okay. I'll order it.

458
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:48,056
But I don't know if your body
will be able to handle that...

459
00:35:56,856 --> 00:36:02,356
Doctor. I think we'll have an easier
time seeing auroras if we go on a tour.

460
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:04,656
- Should I sign us up?
- Yes. Let's do that.

461
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:09,056
But it's such a long distance.
I'm not sure you'll be able to do it...

462
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,056
Doctor.

463
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:24,456
Since we're going to Alaska,
it'd be nice to see igloos.

464
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:26,456
Should we go on a tour for that, too?

465
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:30,956
You're just going to say
that we can't again, right?

466
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,257
Yes.

467
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:35,256
Why do you keep doing that?

468
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,556
It's because I want
to be with you for a long time.

469
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:42,457
You're my mentor.

470
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:44,857
Once a mentor, always a mentor!
Aren't I right?

471
00:36:45,057 --> 00:36:47,257
You have to guide me
for 20 or 30 more years.

472
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:49,257
Just 6 months?
That's not enough time.

473
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:55,407
Please get the surgery, Doctor.

474
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:57,557
You can overcome it with chemo

475
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,057
and become healthy again,
and go see the auroras with me

476
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:03,956
and go to Peru, and dye your hair purple
and try all the beers in the world!

477
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:06,056
You can enjoy the rest
of your life like that!

478
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:12,657
Let's be together for a long time. Okay?

479
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:33,956
<i>[10. Lying down in an igloo in
Alaska, and seeing auroras.]</i>

480
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:49,657
<i>Number 11.
Getting the surgery.</i>

481
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,608
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

482
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:19,970
What are you doing?
Hurry and get up!

483
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,071
First, we'll announce our
engagement at the cafe in a month.

484
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:25,972
Then we'll both save 40 percent of
our paychecks and put it away.

485
00:38:26,172 --> 00:38:28,371
We'll get married in
three years, at the latest.

486
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:31,972
3 years?
But you'll still only be 24.

487
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:32,772
My age isn't important.

488
00:38:32,972 --> 00:38:37,071
I just want her to wear a wedding
dress when she's young and pretty.

489
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:41,972
We'll have a small-scale wedding,
and we'll rent a tiny one-room apartment.

490
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:44,071
We'll pay back our debts within a year

491
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:46,271
and we'll get on the waiting list
for apartments.

492
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,170
You think that they accept just anybody?

493
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,470
What about your living expenses?

494
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,470
And what will you be doing
around that time?

495
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,170
Are you still going to be
working as an intern at the center?

496
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,170
I'm going to get my LCPC license
within three years.

497
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,071
She says that she won't
marry me otherwise.

498
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:01,972
As soon as we get married, we're going
to make four separate bank accounts

499
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:04,071
for income, expenses,
emergency funds, and investments.

500
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:09,021
And we're also getting some emergency
funds ready for when we can't work.

501
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:13,772
That's our ten-year plan for now.
Our last objective is to get a house.

502
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:18,871
Also, I'm going to support Yoo Rim
until she becomes a famous documentarian.

503
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,271
When will your parents be meeting?

504
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,772
That's the first step
in getting married.

505
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:33,372
Do you think that marriage
is just between you two?

506
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,972
Hye Rim! So you're finally
giving us your blessing?

507
00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:39,771
Thanks so much, Hye Rim!
I promise that we'll be happy!

508
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,271
Oh, go away!

509
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:04,031
How's Dr. Bae?

510
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:07,031
She's a lot better than expected.

511
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:12,231
Hey, Soo Hyun.
I'm sorry about before.

512
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:16,732
I forgot how hard Father
used to be on you.

513
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:20,032
I'm sorry that I spoke to you like that.

514
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:23,731
Okay.

515
00:40:30,632 --> 00:40:39,231
<i>Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!</i>

516
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:48,431
<i>Happy birthday, dear Soo Hyun,
happy birthday to you!</i>

517
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:59,331
All right.
Speech, please!

518
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:05,532
- Thank you, everyone, and...
- He's getting nervous!

519
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:09,632
Anyway, thank you.

520
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:13,432
All right, then. Isn't it time
for me to get presents?

521
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:17,331
Oh yeah, presents! But before that,
there's something we have to do.

522
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:18,831
What is it?

523
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:24,931
Then I'll go for it too!

524
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:47,632
- Look here.
- Oh my gosh!

525
00:41:53,731 --> 00:41:56,532
- Yoo Rim, go and wash up.
- Okay.

526
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:12,432
- Yes?
- Hello.

527
00:42:12,632 --> 00:42:17,431
- It's me, Seo Yeon Hui.
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>

528
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:18,838
I'm leaving now.

529
00:42:22,231 --> 00:42:27,032
Today's Soo Hyun's birthday, right?

530
00:42:28,231 --> 00:42:31,331
<i>Can you tell this to Soo Hyun for me?</i>

531
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:34,233
That I love him.

532
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:39,132
<i>I think that it became
ingrained inside my head.</i>

533
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:45,631
That I'd done something wrong.

534
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:50,831
That she hadn't come back
even once for my birthday

535
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:56,632
because I'd spilled the ice cream.

536
00:42:57,132 --> 00:43:00,431
You can't leave now, ma'am!

537
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:02,731
Excuse me?

538
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:05,731
<i>Please hurry and come.
Mr. Soo Hyun is waiting-</i>

539
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:09,231
Hello? Hello?

540
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,132
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is in the middle of a call.</i>

541
00:43:30,731 --> 00:43:33,673
- Hello.
- I'd like to check out.

542
00:43:33,873 --> 00:43:34,719
Understood.

543
00:43:48,731 --> 00:43:52,032
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is in the middle of a call.</i>

544
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:56,432
It's okay!
No need to come out and meet me.

545
00:43:56,632 --> 00:44:00,032
Yes, it's the 11 p.m. flight.
I'm heading there now.

546
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:28,231
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

547
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:37,231
You have a guest
named Seo Yeon Hui, right?

548
00:44:37,431 --> 00:44:38,632
Has she checked out yet?

549
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:43,132
Yes. Ten minutes ago.

550
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:05,532
I came back because I was curious
about what you said before.

551
00:45:06,032 --> 00:45:10,731
I couldn't hear you clearly, but I
thought it was something about Soo Hyun.

552
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,833
Who is it?

553
00:45:54,831 --> 00:45:56,431
Who is it?

554
00:46:17,831 --> 00:46:24,132
I'm sorry, Soo Hyun, that I wasn't here.

555
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:26,632
How did you get here?

556
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:32,931
Happy birthday, Soo Hyun.

557
00:46:35,632 --> 00:46:38,532
I came too late, didn't I?

558
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:50,431
So you remembered my birthday?

559
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:53,731
Yeah.

560
00:46:55,231 --> 00:47:01,231
How could any mother
forget their child's birthday?

561
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:09,032
Then, what about you telling me
that you'd come back on my birthday?

562
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:12,431
Did you remember that?

563
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:15,131
About that, I-

564
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:17,532
Why couldn't you remember that?

565
00:47:19,032 --> 00:47:25,231
Do you know how hard
it was for me because of that?

566
00:47:30,032 --> 00:47:37,018
I thought that you'd left
because of me, and I was so...

567
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:45,188
I'm sorry. It's all my fault!
It's all my fault.

568
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:58,873
If you broke up with Dad, you should've
fought to take me with you!

569
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:06,331
How could you leave me
with such a terrible father?

570
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:11,431
Were you planning to have
a jolly old life on your own?

571
00:48:13,831 --> 00:48:18,132
I was too weak.

572
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:24,532
I was kicked out,
so I didn't have anything.

573
00:48:26,032 --> 00:48:32,632
But even so, I tried my best. But your
father's lawyer was too strong, so...

574
00:48:33,632 --> 00:48:36,881
He blamed everything on me
and took away custody-

575
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,331
But you still should've come
to take me away!

576
00:48:42,632 --> 00:48:45,632
My stepmom, dad, and younger brother
were all happy together

577
00:48:45,832 --> 00:48:50,181
but I...
and then you started a new family!

578
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:54,731
I'm the only one who was left abandoned!

579
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:59,632
Soo Hyun.

580
00:49:03,032 --> 00:49:11,132
Do you know what it feels like to have
nobody on your side and be all alone?

581
00:49:11,332 --> 00:49:18,132
If only... if only from now on,
I'll always be by your side.

582
00:49:21,032 --> 00:49:29,731
I'm sorry, Soo Hyun! I'm so sorry
for keeping you waiting for 30 years.

583
00:50:20,132 --> 00:50:24,532
This is the first dose of chemotherapy.
You'll be getting this for a week.

584
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:44,132
Doctor. I downloaded some movies.
Want to watch some?

585
00:50:44,632 --> 00:50:45,832
No, it's okay.

586
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:49,431
I have dramas, too! Korean ones,
American ones, and British ones.

587
00:50:50,132 --> 00:50:52,231
It's okay.

588
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:58,231
Then, how about a performance?
It's Choi Seung Chan's live...

589
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,532
Oh, it's not live is it?
Well, anyway, a performance!

590
00:51:01,132 --> 00:51:03,532
What kind of performance?

591
00:51:18,632 --> 00:51:23,782
<i>I was born to love you...</i>

592
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:31,032
<i>with every single beat of my heart.</i>

593
00:51:31,632 --> 00:51:37,617
<i>Yes, I was born to take care of you</i>

594
00:51:39,077 --> 00:51:42,181
<i>every single day!</i>

595
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:49,831
<i>Alright! Hey, hey!</i>

<i>I was born to love you
with every single beat of my heart.</i>

00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:18,331
<i>Yes, I was born to take care of you
every single day of my life.</i>

598
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,331
<i>You are the one for me...</i>

599
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:26,684
Hey, Ji Ho.
What's Mr. Soo Hyun doing?

600
00:52:26,884 --> 00:52:29,331
Ms. Clare is here,
so they're working together.

601
00:52:29,531 --> 00:52:31,263
- Clare is here again?
- Yes.

602
00:52:31,463 --> 00:52:34,532
He said that they'll probably be up
all night because it's a lot of work.

603
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:46,931
Oh my. She won't eat dinner
with me anymore.

604
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:51,131
She's always having
dinner with that guy!

605
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:54,132
Even so, I heard
that the two of you got a lot closer.

606
00:52:54,332 --> 00:52:59,032
But why are you dating a guy like him?

607
00:52:59,532 --> 00:53:00,332
Excuse me?

608
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:06,132
I heard it through Secretary Lee.
You're dating Choi Soo Hyun?

609
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:08,531
Oh, um. yes.

610
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:16,431
Figures. I should've known from when
you told me to go get counseling.

611
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:24,632
But, do you two go well together?
He's kind of a jerk.

612
00:53:24,832 --> 00:53:27,231
Is he kind and considerate to you?

613
00:53:27,773 --> 00:53:30,073
Lately he's been too considerate,
which is its own problem.

614
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:34,974
I fixed him up with some counseling so
I guess he's confident that he can love

615
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:37,672
and is flirting with women
left and right!

616
00:53:38,273 --> 00:53:40,672
Today, he brought this woman
named Clare again-

617
00:53:40,872 --> 00:53:41,972
Who?

618
00:53:42,172 --> 00:53:47,474
Chairman. When you were dating
your wife, you had a rival, right?

619
00:53:47,674 --> 00:53:49,472
Huh? How did you know that?

620
00:53:49,672 --> 00:53:51,873
I saw your letters from
when you were dat-

621
00:53:52,073 --> 00:53:54,172
I mean, the spirit within me told me.

622
00:53:54,773 --> 00:54:00,873
But how did you get rid of your rival?
Did you buy her gifts?

623
00:54:01,073 --> 00:54:02,274
Or did you just cling on to her?

624
00:54:02,474 --> 00:54:09,773
Goethe once said this:
"Love will find those who seek it."

625
00:54:09,973 --> 00:54:16,773
Don't worry.
Love always finds a way.

626
00:54:18,474 --> 00:54:19,672
Now eat up.

627
00:54:21,273 --> 00:54:23,873
Thanks for helping me
out with work all this time.

628
00:54:24,073 --> 00:54:25,173
You were a great help.

629
00:54:25,373 --> 00:54:29,172
It was nothing. All I did was
give you advice on a few documents.

630
00:54:29,372 --> 00:54:33,172
You're going back now? What about
your ride? Did you take a cab here?

631
00:54:33,372 --> 00:54:35,672
Yeah. I'm heading straight
to the airport from here.

632
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,073
I don't think there are
any taxis around here.

633
00:54:38,273 --> 00:54:40,474
Let's go.
I'll give you a ride to the airport.

634
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,723
Ms. Hye Rim, I'm going to drop her off.

635
00:55:02,923 --> 00:55:05,474
She's going back to the States, so-

636
00:55:05,674 --> 00:55:07,072
Did I ask?

637
00:55:22,873 --> 00:55:25,773
What's that look on your face?
Did something happen?

638
00:55:30,474 --> 00:55:34,773
Why do I always end up like this?

639
00:55:35,773 --> 00:55:37,773
What are you talking about?

640
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:42,974
I feel like Mr. Soo Hyun is going
to leave me now, too.

641
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,974
I feel so uneasy.

644
00:56:43,474 --> 00:56:45,172
Welcome.

645
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:49,672
Can you give me one of

Yes, ma'am.

You think I'll fall for this again?

Are you crazy?
I'll never go!

Um, somebody is sitting here.

651
00:57:52,672 --> 00:57:56,773
I don't think so.
This is G-26. My seat.

652
00:58:07,072 --> 00:58:09,072
- Huh?
- What's going on?

653
00:58:10,773 --> 00:58:12,472
Hello everyone.

654
00:58:12,672 --> 00:58:16,274
Cellphone usage during the feature film

655
00:58:16,474 --> 00:58:20,773
can cause other moviegoers to
feel despair and heartbreak.

656
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:24,274
Please turn off your phones
so that all of us

657
00:58:24,474 --> 00:58:30,873
who live in an age of despair
and heartbreak, can have hope again.

658
00:58:31,773 --> 00:58:35,873
Don't kick the seat in front of you,
and please throw trash in trash bins.

659
00:58:36,073 --> 00:58:39,872
In the event of an emergency,
please use the exit on this side

660
00:58:40,072 --> 00:58:44,672
and the bathrooms are around the corner
on the right, so please tread lightly.

661
00:58:44,872 --> 00:58:46,474
Also...

662
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:51,172
to the woman sitting in G-25.

663
00:58:55,873 --> 00:59:02,773
The woman sitting in G-25 is
more important to me than anyone else.

664
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:07,873
The one who healed my scars
is Ms. G-25

665
00:59:08,474 --> 00:59:12,072
and the one who made me be
self-reflective is also Ms. G-25.

666
00:59:13,273 --> 00:59:15,474
And the one who made
me feel that I should change

667
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:21,672
and become a cooler guy
is also Ms. G-25.

668

I love you, Ms. Hye Rim.

669

What was that?
Are you crazy?

670
00:59:58,572 --> 01:00:03,672
Yes, I'm crazy.
How was my execution of Task 3?

671
01:00:03,872 --> 01:00:04,673
What?

672
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:08,774
I just did Task 3
of the experiment for you.

673
01:00:08,974 --> 01:00:11,974
A task that one must perform without
caring about what spectators think.

674
01:00:12,174 --> 01:00:14,572
A task that only
a crazy person would do.

675
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:20,672
This is evidence that I've
completely fallen in love with you.

676
01:00:22,572 --> 01:00:25,873
You're going on about this
experiment until the very end, huh?

677
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,373
I love you, Ms. Hye Rim.
