1
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:36,659
Action, Jake.

2
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:44,427
Cut.
Look, what's the problem here?

3
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:49,339
Remember, I want you to open the coffin
a beat after you open your eyes.

4
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,875
Get him out of herel
Come on! Raise the camera!

5
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,673
Joe, give me a hand.
Something's the matter with him.

6
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,181
That's all right, Jake.
Just relax.

7
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,185
We got you. Something's going on.
Something's weird.

8
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,687
- Are you okay, babe?
- Give him some air.

9
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,748
What's the matter? Speak to me.
Come on, talk.

10
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,851
What's the matter?

11
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:10,363
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

12
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,867
I was in the coffin. I closed my eyes.
I thought everything would be okay.

13
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,426
I opened my eyes, and the camera
was right on top of me...

14
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:19,200
and I couldn't move.

15
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:21,367
It's no big thing.
I just...

16
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,537
For a second there,
I just couldn't move.

17
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,705
I don't know what happened.
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,545
Firel

19
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:30,551
Nol What happened?

20
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:34,385
Get up there!
Put some water on it!

21
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:39,721
This is great.
That's terrific.

22
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:41,229
You got it under control?

23
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:47,904
Look, Jake,
you really look exhausted, babe.

24
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:51,739
Why don't you take a shower
and go on home. We lost the sun.

25
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,074
Let me try it one more time.
I can do it.

26
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:57,810
I know you can,
but we don't have any sun anymore.

27
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:34,947
Can I have nuts with that
and a Manhattan?

28
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:36,456
- Yeah.
- And fries.

29
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:37,957
- Right.
- Rings.

30
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:41,622
- Anything to drink?
- Two large Cokes with ice.

31
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:44,791
Onions on everything.

32
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,961
- That to go?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:49,301
4.99.

34
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:50,806
Keep the change.

35
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:53,968
You too.
See you guys.

36
00:06:02,017 --> 00:06:06,283
- Scully, how's that picture coming?
- Good. Fine.

37
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:09,450
- Great.
- I'll have a Jack Daniels, neat.

38
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:12,620
Are you serious?
You quit drinking. Remember?

39
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:14,629
Just get the drink, Doug.

40
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,796
What's the matter?

41
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:19,960
They cut your big scene?

42
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:30,046
Again.

43
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:46,096
Carol?

44
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,869
I thought you were a bartender,
not a priest.

45
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:55,066
That's right.
I'm a bartender.

46
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,541
Then keep the fucking glass filled.

47
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:02,515
Keep your own glass filled.

48
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:08,180
- I'm sorry.
- That's cool.

49
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:10,850
Just don't pay any attention to me.

50
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:12,359
l...

51
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:19,933
You need a place to stay?

52
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,872
Yeah, I guess I do.

53
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,070
What are you doing here?
I thought you were working.

54
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:01,077
I am. I got a week off.

55
00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:03,477
I figured I'd go
to some interviews, stay busy.

56
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:07,644
- Great.
- Do you know about any sublets?

57
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,484
- I'II check around.
- Something available immediately.

58
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:13,649
- Not offhand.
- What... Ho!

59
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:16,490
The whole world's here.
You two know each other?

60
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:19,326
- Jake Scully, Sam Bouchard.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

61
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:21,833
- Right here.
- I'll see you in class later.

62
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,495
- We got class today?
- At 3:00.

63
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:27,040
- Right.
- Good luck.

64
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,338
What have you been doing lately?

65
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,176
I just started a low-budget,
independent horror film.

66
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:36,012
'Vampire's Kiss."
I play the vampire.

67
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:40,183
Sounds interesting.

68
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:43,349
Before that I did Petruchio
in 'Taming of the Shrew."

69
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,188
Anything else?

70
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:49,356
You mean anything good?

71
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:51,196
You are working.

72
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:55,760
- That's good now, isn't it?
- Yeah.

73
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:11,553
- Hi. Small town.
- Yeah.

74
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:14,386
- Jack Scully.
- Jake.

75
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,891
Give them hell.

76
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,063
Hello.

77
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:38,150
I remember that it was dark.

78
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,420
Really black.

79
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:45,083
I was just a little kid.

80
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:49,095
And the wall behind me was cold.

81
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,258
And damp.

82
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:54,097
I was hiding. I was...

83
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,932
Oh, yeah.

84
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:58,097
I was part of this game: Sardine.

85
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,768
I was it, and I was hiding.

86
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:04,437
Everybody was looking for me.

87
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:07,948
And there was humming.

88
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:10,280
I was behind the freezer
in the basement.

89
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:17,452
And I had jammed myself in
so hard behind the freezer...

90
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:20,359
that I couldn't move.

91
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,461
I'm afraid.

92
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:30,473
Uh-huh.
What are you afraid of?

93
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,244
They're not gonna find me.

94
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:37,782
But they're not supposed
to find you.

95
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,443
But I'm afraid
because I can't move.

96
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:44,149
Why don't you cry out?

97
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:48,486
I can't. I'm afraid.

98
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,995
Besides, I'm the sardine.
They're not supposed to find me.

99
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,832
Now particularize that.

100
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:58,337
Who can't find you?

101
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:01,431
My brothers.
They're bigger than me.

102
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:05,675
First time
they ever let me play.

103
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:08,010
If they're your brothers,
they'll want to help you, right?

104
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:11,017
No. They won't let me play again.

105
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:14,145
- They're bigger than you are.
- Yeah.

106
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:17,350
Will they hurt you?

107
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:18,858
Yes.

108
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:21,192
How?

109
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,527
They'll laugh at me for getting stuck
behind the freezer...

110
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,089
and for crying out for help.

111
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:29,200
The big baby.

112
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:30,704
That's right.

113
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,876
You are a baby.

114
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,713
I know.

115
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:41,718
Yeah, and you're afraid.

116
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:43,220
Yeah.

117
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,724
You must act.

118
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,734
I can't. I'm afraid.

119
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:58,998
- You'll never escape.
- I know.

120
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:01,906
You'll die.

121
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:04,576
Yeah.

122
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:08,077
Bullshit!

123
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:10,083
You've got to act!

124
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:12,786
Fuck the fear.

125
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:17,423
You've got to cry out for help!
Come on!

126
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:19,425
Use your body!
Cry for help!

127
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:23,295
You can do it.

128
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,201
I want you to cry out.

129
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:30,760
I can't. I'm a sardine.

130
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,830
Sardines in a can are dead.

131
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:36,103
They can't feel.
They can't be afraid.

132
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:38,806
But you're alive and afraid.

133
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,940
You're not a goddamn dead sardine!

134
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,952
- This is crap.
- Dig down deep!

135
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:47,688
Cry out!

136
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:55,495
- I can't.
- Come on.

137
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,363
Leave the guy alone.

138
00:13:57,502 --> 00:14:00,404
Do not interrupt this exercise.

139
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,373
This looks like
a mind-fuck to me.

140
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,639
What is your name? You're not
a member of this class, are you?

141
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:09,880
That's right. I'm not.

142
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,644
I thought this was a class for acting,
not humiliation.

143
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,919
What gives you the right
to fuck around with this guy's head?

144
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:25,324
- I think you better leave.
- I think that's a good idea.

145
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,494
I want to act.
Come on.

146
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:32,561
Class is out.
Come on. Let's go.

147
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,073
I'm sorry, Will.

148
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,575
I can't do this today.

149
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,910
This is called an exit.

150
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:47,753
Shit.

151
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:52,253
What a fool I am.

152
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:56,423
You're too hard on yourself.

153
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:59,765
Some of these guys
can't get a job.

154
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:02,432
They put an ad in the trade.
They call themselves teachers.

155
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:07,103
What do they teach us?
How to be more fucked up than we are.

156
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:08,611
That's not it.

157
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:17,553
- Can we get another round?
- Coming up.

158
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:26,765
- Thanks.
- Check.

159
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,765
Are you married?

160
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:34,138
Separated.

161
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:38,075
Me too, as of yesterday.

162
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:43,140
We weren't married,
but it was almost the same thing.

163
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:44,648
What happened?

164
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,649
I'm sorry.
That's none of my business.

165
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,658
That's okay.
It's just...

166
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,823
Sounds so stupid.

167
00:15:57,232 --> 00:15:58,995
These things usually do.

168
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:03,933
Caught her in bed
with another guy.

169
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:05,564
Can you believe that?

170
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:07,074
Man.

171
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:09,668
You had no idea?

172
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:14,984
None.

173
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:19,187
Christ, I keep seeing it.

174
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:24,857
Carol lying there.

175
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:29,862
Her face was glowing.

176
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:36,471
- Her face was glowing?
- Yeah.

177
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,477
How do you get
a girl's face to glow?

178
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:42,035
I got 16 years of good humping.

179
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:46,551
Not once did I get a glimmer,
let alone a fucking glow.

180
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,052
Glowing?

181
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:54,723
- I'm sorry. That's tough.
- No, you're right.

182
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:57,058
It's not that big a deal, really.

183
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,724
- You kicked the bitch out I hope.
- I didn't.

184
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,394
- Why not?
- It was her place.

185
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:12,571
You've been through the shitter.

186
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,920
- Where are you staying?
- I got a friend with a floor.

187
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,263
You ready for some good news?

188
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:30,425
Yeah.

189
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,594
I got this five-week gig coming up.

190
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,934
Seattle Rep's doing a revival
of 'Private Lives."

191
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:37,100
I've been house-sitting
for a friend.

192
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:40,768
- He gives me a good deal on the place...
- I've been looking for a sublet.

193
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:43,780
- Would this be available right away?
- Wait here.

194
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:46,612
Let me make a phone call.
Don't move.

195
00:17:49,855 --> 00:17:52,949
- Do you like plants?
- Sure.

196
00:17:57,996 --> 00:18:01,193
- I can't believe this.
- It's something, isn't it?

197
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:07,639
Be if ever so humble.

198
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,573
- This is unbelievable.
- I know if's nof much.

199
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:15,810
- Can you handle this?
- I've never seen anything like it.

200
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:18,819
- Your friend must really be loaded.
- He's filthy with the stuff.

201
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:23,325
Anyway, here they are.
Water them every day after 6:00.

202
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:25,484
- Right.
- You got it?

203
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:28,998
- That's it.
- Listen, this is really nice of you.

204
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:32,330
No thanks necessary.
One struggling actor helping another.

205
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,165
- That's what it's all about.
- Thank you.

206
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:37,172
- Just don't let the damn plants die.
- You got it.

207
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,004
- Where is he anyway?
- Alan?

208
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,341
- Yeah.
- He spends a lot of time in Europe.

209
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,847
I got a well-stocked bar.

210
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,007
- Rotating bed.
- "Rotating"?

211
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:51,020
Sauna and Jacuzzi in the back
just beyond the walk-in closets.

212
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,454
As soon as I pack up,
you can put your stuff away.

213
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,014
- Are you leaving now?
- Yeah, l...

214
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,861
The hell with it.
I got time for one more drink.

215
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,697
I'll still be able
to catch the last flight.

216
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,872
What a setup.
This is great.

217
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,374
Isn't it?

218
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:16,048
Thank you.

219
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:18,549
- Sam, here's to a friendship...
- Wait.

220
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:23,221
Let's do this right.
Come here.

221
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:30,897
To Hollywood.

222
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,398
Yeah.

223
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:38,401
What a view.

224
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:42,737
That's just part of it.

225
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:47,749
There is one very special feature
to this house.

226
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:51,913
- What are you looking at?
- Where are you?

227
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:59,059
There she is.

228
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:02,430
Show time.

229
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:10,597
I'd like you to meet
my favorite neighbor.

230
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,180
- See her?
- Whoa.

231
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,285
It gets better.

232
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,292
- What's she doing?
- Just keep watching. You'II see.

233
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,159
- You want to get a little closer?
- You bet.

234
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,961
- Oh, my God.
- Focused?

235
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:38,563
- She's a little out of focus. Yes!
- Yes? Hang on.

236
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:42,642
Does she do this a lot?

237
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:44,803
Like clockwork, every night.

238
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:31,859
Jesus.

239
00:23:30,557 --> 00:23:31,991
What do you think?

240
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:38,192
- It's something, isn't it?
- Yeah.

241
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:40,326
Lady does the same gig every night.

242
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,998
Did you get a look at her face?

243
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:46,440
Too bad. She is gorgeous.
Shit.

244
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,672
- I gotta get going.
- Can I help you?

245
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:50,178
All right.

246
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:52,011
Don't forget your scarf.

247
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:55,510
Here's the key.

248
00:23:55,586 --> 00:23:58,021
Try not to make too many
long-distance phone calls.

249
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,853
Thanks again.
This is good of you.

250
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:01,689
- You're doing me a favor too.
- Thank you.

251
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,695
- Take it easy.
- Knock 'em dead!

252
00:24:04,763 --> 00:24:07,198
They're already dead in Seattle.

253
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:08,699
So long.

254
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:18,372
My, my

255
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:19,877
Uh-oh

256
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:23,712
The house is burning
buf fhere's no one home

257
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:01,089
Jesus!

258
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,303
Bastard.

259
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,140
Where fhe hell have you been?
I've been calling you all over fown.

260
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,472
I'm sorry, Frank. I've been having
some real problems with Carol.

261
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:54,036
I've been staying
at a friend's house.

262
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,981
You got a few more problems.
Rubin fired you.

263
00:26:57,084 --> 00:27:00,212
- What?
- You don'f have a job anymore.

264
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:02,312
He gave me some bullshit
about artistic differences.

265
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:03,857
What the hell happened?

266
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:06,689
Nothing.
How can he do that?

267
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:08,389
They're doing it right now.

268
00:27:08,464 --> 00:27:11,923
Can't we do something?
Maybe I should talk to Rubin.

269
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,333
You better forget it.
They've already hired another guy.

270
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:16,929
- How do you know?
- He's my client.

271
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,112
Now bring them up.

272
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,845
You're loving every minute of it,
sweetheart. It feels so good.

273
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,683
You're getting ready to take
a nice chunk out of the neck.

274
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:33,350
Hands down. Good.

275
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:35,359
All right, cut!

276
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:37,019
Kill the water and steam.

277
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:39,030
I thought you were gonna
give me another chance.

278
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:43,032
Look, I got a picture to make here.
I got 25 days to make it.

279
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,695
I got no time to fuck around
with a claustrophobic vampire...

280
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:49,036
who freezes every time
he lies down in the coffin.

281
00:27:49,107 --> 00:27:52,201
- I'm not claustrophobic.
- Then what happened? Stage fright?

282
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:54,211
I don't know.
It never happened before.

283
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,215
It's never gonna happen again.
Good-bye. I gotta get back to work.

284
00:27:58,283 --> 00:28:01,377
- You promised me another chance.
- I lied.

285
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:03,217
- Don't you yell at me!
- Big fucking deal.

286
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:05,052
- Get outta here! Beat it!
- Listen...

287
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:09,391
Joe, get him outta here! You don't come
in here yelling at me on my setl

288
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:11,556
- You don't have the right to lie to me.
- There's the door.

289
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:14,230
Go onl Get out!

290
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:17,737
Get out the door, you fruitcake.
What's wrong with you?

291
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:19,274
- He's the boss.
- It's not fair.

292
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:23,335
What's everybody standing around for?
Let's get back to work. Come on.

293
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:50,472
Just like clockwork.

294
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:23,976
There she goes.

295
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:06,979
Excuse me.
Could you move, please? Please!

296
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,784
I gotta go.
Thank you.

297
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:54,531
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Thank you.

298
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:06,548
I have to see you.

299
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:09,385
What time did you call?

300
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:12,725
I'm never home till after 7:00.

301
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,888
Yes, he hit me again.

302
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:24,398
I've got to talk to someone.

303
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:27,240
Today.

304
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,402
The Beach Terrace Motel?

305
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:34,574
I'II wear something special.

306
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:36,083
You'II see.

307
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,016
Yeah. Okay.

308
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:44,526
Bye.

309
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,824
- Security, please.
- This is securify.

310
00:37:15,892 --> 00:37:18,828
Please come over to Bellini's.
I think we have a problem.

311
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:10,042
Excuse me.

312
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:15,389
- May I help you?
- No, thank you.

313
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:58,397
Did you see that guy?

314
00:41:24,628 --> 00:41:26,722
- It's the cream Mercedes.
- Wait here, please.

315
00:42:10,513 --> 00:42:13,448
- Thank you. Here you are.
- Thank you, ma'am.

316
00:42:15,017 --> 00:42:17,451
- Can I have my car, please?
- Yes, sir.

317
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,149
Thank you.
Right away. As soon as possible.

318
00:42:21,924 --> 00:42:24,291
Straight toward the beach,
down the stairs.

319
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:25,793
Thank you.

320
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,344
Hello?

321
00:45:50,152 --> 00:45:51,585
Yes.

322
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:55,014
You've got to come.

323
00:45:57,193 --> 00:45:59,821
I need to talk to you.

324
00:45:59,896 --> 00:46:01,387
I've got to talk to someone.

325
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:07,529
I need you.

326
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:10,604
Excuse me.

327
00:47:11,942 --> 00:47:14,069
Someone's following you.

328
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,083
I know.

329
00:47:23,855 --> 00:47:25,447
No, it's not me.

330
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:13,695
Are you all right?

331
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,203
He got away.

332
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,371
You got the purse.

333
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:21,878
You better check it.
He took something.

334
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,215
What's the matter?

335
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,386
I'm just out of breath.

336
00:51:31,157 --> 00:51:34,718
Can you take me out of here?

337
00:51:34,794 --> 00:51:36,228
Sure.

338
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:38,925
- Here.
- Thank you.

339
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:13,427
All right. Thank you.

340
00:52:13,502 --> 00:52:17,098
I feel much better now.
I'm fine.

341
00:52:17,174 --> 00:52:21,109
I saw you back there
and at the hotel.

342
00:52:21,177 --> 00:52:24,909
- You've been following me.
- Yeah.

343
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,548
Why?
Did my husband hire you?

344
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,462
I'm...

345
00:52:41,401 --> 00:52:42,833
What?

346
00:53:53,112 --> 00:53:54,545
Yes.

347
00:54:23,744 --> 00:54:26,737
I can't.
I can't do this.

348
00:54:26,814 --> 00:54:28,248
Not here.

349
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,504
Hello, Gloria.
How are you?

350
00:54:50,574 --> 00:54:53,441

God!

383
01:05:20,461 --> 01:05:23,122
I'm Detective McLean.

384
01:05:23,196 --> 01:05:25,391
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

385
01:05:27,934 --> 01:05:29,868
I see you're an actor.

386
01:05:35,309 --> 01:05:37,300
Yeah.

387
01:05:37,379 --> 01:05:39,312
Ever been in anything?

388
01:05:41,282 --> 01:05:44,217
'Emerald Point" and a "Hart To Hart"
that was pretty good.

389
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:47,050
Very interesting.

390
01:05:48,123 --> 01:05:50,058
You make a living?

391
01:05:52,728 --> 01:05:54,162
Yeah.

392
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:57,562
Good-Iooking boy.

393
01:05:57,635 --> 01:05:59,067
Talented.

394
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:02,536
I got a real problem with you.

395
01:06:04,408 --> 01:06:05,899
What do you mean?

396
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:09,469
I mean, you're my only witness
to this murder...

397
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,483
and you're a peeper.

398
01:06:12,851 --> 01:06:16,117
In my book, that's a pervert
and a sex offender.

399
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:19,022
- What do you mean "a sex offender"?
- Save it.

400
01:06:19,092 --> 01:06:21,652
I ask the questions.

401
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,989
What about this Indian? When he snatched
her pocketbook, you got it back.

402
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:27,659
- Is that right?
- That's right.

403
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:29,701
Was anything missing?

404
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:31,702
I saw him take a credit card.

405
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,270
Not a credit card, a card key.

406
01:06:36,342 --> 01:06:38,367
He used it to get into her house.

407
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:47,148
Did Gloria know it was missing?

408
01:06:47,221 --> 01:06:49,621
She didn't say anything to me.

409
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,560
You talked to her?

410
01:06:56,064 --> 01:06:58,556
Come on,
you must have said something.

411
01:07:06,209 --> 01:07:09,111
- It was just small talk, you know?
- No, I don't know.

412
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:11,114
Did you come on to her?

413
01:07:11,182 --> 01:07:13,207
Were you trying to do a number
on her head?

414
01:07:13,284 --> 01:07:15,276
Trying to freak her out
with all you know about her?

415
01:07:15,353 --> 01:07:18,982
- You're wrong.
- Why were you following Gloria Revelle?

416
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:24,754
Because I got concerned
when I saw that guy following her.

417
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:27,822
But you kept on her tail
after this other guy disappeared.

418
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,333
I know, because...

419
01:07:30,569 --> 01:07:34,337
- I guess I wanted to...
- You wanted to what?

420
01:07:45,517 --> 01:07:46,951
Nothing.

421
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:55,560
What's this?

422
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,132
Some underpants.

423
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,636
Yours?

424
01:08:05,807 --> 01:08:07,331
Where did you get them?

425
01:08:13,482 --> 01:08:16,145
She dropped them in the trash.

426
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:18,313
- Who?
- Gloria.

427
01:08:18,388 --> 01:08:20,379
And you just picked them up?

428
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:24,094
- Yeah.
- Why?

429
01:08:31,135 --> 01:08:33,968
- I don't know.
- Tell the truth.

430
01:08:34,038 --> 01:08:36,701
You fucked her and kept them
for a souvenir.

431
01:08:36,775 --> 01:08:39,710
You didn't fuck her or you didn't
keep them as a souvenir?

432
01:08:39,778 --> 01:08:43,268
- No to both of them.
- Are you just a harmless panty sniffer?

433
01:08:43,348 --> 01:08:45,679
- You got a dirty mind.
- That's a laugh.

434
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,710
You peep on her, follow her, fuck her
and keep her panties as a memento.

435
01:08:49,788 --> 01:08:52,779
Then you sit on the 50-yard line
and watch her being slaughteredl

436
01:08:52,858 --> 01:08:55,349
That's not what happened!
I tried to save her!

437
01:09:00,232 --> 01:09:04,259
Mm-hmm. Some save, Scully.

438
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,934
Remind me to never put my life
in your hands.

439
01:09:14,815 --> 01:09:16,750
Tell me about Alexander Revelle.

440
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:25,156
- What?
- Alexander Revelle, Gloria's husband.

441
01:09:25,228 --> 01:09:26,752
You knew him?

442
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,066
I never met him.

443
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:35,794
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

444
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,839
Was he around
when Gloria got nailed?

445
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:43,336
Do you think he had something
to do with it?

446
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:49,017
Gloria Revelle was a very rich lady.

447
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:55,524
When rich wives get dead,
I usually go after the husband.

448
01:09:57,963 --> 01:10:00,989
The only problem is
you saw a thief.

449
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:03,534
An Indian killed Gloria Revelle.

450
01:10:09,941 --> 01:10:12,638
I won't hold you, Scully.

451
01:10:12,712 --> 01:10:15,647
We have witnesses
to back up your story.

452
01:10:16,849 --> 01:10:20,183
But I want you
to think real hard about this.

453
01:10:21,254 --> 01:10:22,721
As far as I'm concerned...

454
01:10:22,789 --> 01:10:26,191
you're the real reason Gloria Revelle
got murdered.

455
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:32,327
If you hadn't been so busy getting off
by peeping on her...

456
01:10:32,401 --> 01:10:36,428
if you had called the police
about your blood brother, the Indian...

457
01:10:36,506 --> 01:10:39,372
Gloria Revelle would still be alive.

458
01:10:57,694 --> 01:10:59,127
Oh, yeah.

01:11:13,309 --> 01:11:17,247

01:15:57,988 --> 01:16:00,354
- You ready?
- Yeah.

520
01:16:00,424 --> 01:16:01,858
Go ahead.

521
01:16:04,963 --> 01:16:08,057
I like to watch.

522
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:11,969
Makes you hot, doesn't it?

523
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:15,072
Yeah.

524
01:16:16,175 --> 01:16:18,405
Makes me hot too.
Real hot.

525
01:16:18,478 --> 01:16:21,572
Come over here.
I'll show you how hot.

526
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:25,918
All right.
Take off your clothes.

527
01:16:25,986 --> 01:16:27,919
I want to take some pictures.

528
01:16:33,826 --> 01:16:37,558
- What is it that we're watching?
- I don't know.

529
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:40,692
Are you some kind of method actor?

01:16:48,343 --> 01:16:52,279

Makes you hot, doesn't it?

543
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:25,280
Yeah.

544
01:19:26,849 --> 01:19:28,441
Makes me hot too.

545
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,180
Come over here,
and I'II show you how hot.

546
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:55,611
- Where's the come shot?
- Huh? Come?

547
01:21:55,678 --> 01:21:58,739
The come shot. I thought we were doing
'Body Talk" here, not 'Last Tango."

548
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:08,884
You were great out there. Really.
Come on, I'II buy you a drink.

549
01:22:10,527 --> 01:22:13,019
A drink?
I don't even know you.

550
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:16,123
I'm talking business.

551
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,632
Come on.

552
01:22:18,702 --> 01:22:21,137
You know the mirror out there?

553
01:22:21,205 --> 01:22:23,139
That was my idea.

554
01:22:24,543 --> 01:22:27,511
So, you're a genius.

555
01:22:27,578 --> 01:22:32,380
No, but I can make a better film
than Corso, with my eyes closed.

556
01:22:32,451 --> 01:22:35,478
Films cost money, you know.

557
01:22:35,554 --> 01:22:36,988
I got money.

558
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:42,151
Then what are you doing in hard-core?

559
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:43,787
I wanted to meet you.

560
01:22:45,267 --> 01:22:47,167
Why?

561
01:22:47,234 --> 01:22:51,170
Because I think you're sensational.
I think you're the best in the business.

562
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:53,867
I'll pay you top dollar.
I'll give you points.

563
01:22:53,942 --> 01:22:55,910
Whatever it takes.

564
01:22:57,445 --> 01:23:01,006
- Really?
- I want you in my picture.

565
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:05,144
- You're really serious?
- Yeah, of course I am.

566
01:23:05,221 --> 01:23:06,652
Okay, good.

567
01:23:08,423 --> 01:23:10,948
There are some things I like
to get straight up front...

568
01:23:11,026 --> 01:23:13,393
so there are no misunderstandings
later on.

569
01:23:13,461 --> 01:23:16,487
- I don't blame you.
- I do not do animal acts.

570
01:23:16,566 --> 01:23:20,469
I do not do S and M or any variations
of that particular bent.

571
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,505
No water sports either.

572
01:23:22,573 --> 01:23:25,006
I will not shave my pussy,
no fist fucking...

573
01:23:25,074 --> 01:23:27,599
and absolutely no coming in my face.

574
01:23:27,678 --> 01:23:32,843
I get $2,000 a day,
and I do not work without a contract.

575
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:40,358
Fine.
I mean, that's no problem.

576
01:23:42,928 --> 01:23:46,591
- I think we got a deal.
- Cheers.

577
01:23:48,467 --> 01:23:50,402
You ever do any specialty work?

578
01:23:52,339 --> 01:23:55,036
What kind of specialty work
are you looking for?

579
01:23:56,676 --> 01:23:59,304
A woman alone,
getting herself off.

580
01:24:01,282 --> 01:24:02,806
It's got to be really hot.

581
01:24:06,354 --> 01:24:07,788
Is that all?

582
01:24:09,224 --> 01:24:13,025
I have a routine that is a sure ten
on the peter-meter.

583
01:24:14,095 --> 01:24:16,325
- I know. I've seen it.
- Yeah?

584
01:24:16,397 --> 01:24:18,332
A few times.

585
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:21,927
Yeah, I'm known far and wide...

586
01:24:22,004 --> 01:24:24,370
for that little bit of business.

587
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:32,212
I want you to know
I saw 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

588
01:24:32,282 --> 01:24:36,514
and I think your acting
is top drawer.

589
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:41,990
- My acting?
- Yep.

590
01:24:42,059 --> 01:24:46,292
You're fantastic.
Really. Sensational.

591
01:24:46,363 --> 01:24:49,128
I'II tell you something else.

592
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,668
- You have got a terrific...
- Body.

593
01:24:53,239 --> 01:24:54,671
Smile.

594
01:24:58,544 --> 01:24:59,978
Smile"?

595
01:25:08,755 --> 01:25:11,156
Look at you.

596
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:14,023
- Kimberly, how are you?
- I'm fine, just lovely.

597
01:25:14,095 --> 01:25:18,499
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friend?

598
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:22,467
- Kimberly Hess. Hello.
- Nice to know you.

599
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:25,566
So, Jake, you working?

600
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,302
Yeah, here and there.
We have to run.

601
01:25:28,376 --> 01:25:30,072
- It's great to see you though.
- Right.

602
01:25:30,145 --> 01:25:32,135
Jake and I worked together
in the past.

603
01:25:32,213 --> 01:25:33,646
- Really?
- Yeah.

604
01:25:33,716 --> 01:25:37,117
I thought I knew everybody
in this business.

605
01:25:38,686 --> 01:25:40,153
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

606
01:25:40,222 --> 01:25:42,850
I don't see how someone
could know everyone.

607
01:25:42,925 --> 01:25:44,826
It's a funny business.

608
01:25:46,997 --> 01:25:48,988
Anyway, I wanted to ask you...

609
01:25:49,065 --> 01:25:52,660
have you heard of any roles
that might be right for...

610
01:25:52,736 --> 01:25:55,831
- No, I'm sorry.
- I have. I have a tip for you.

611
01:25:55,906 --> 01:25:58,740
- Really?
- Yes, Simon La Farge is casting.

612
01:25:58,809 --> 01:26:00,835
- You know him, right?
- No.

613
01:26:00,912 --> 01:26:03,847
No? Are you from outer space?

614
01:26:03,915 --> 01:26:07,851
Just tell him that you ran into me.
Here's his number.

615
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,686
You might want to firm up a bit
before you go and see him.

616
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:15,353
One more thing.
Do you mind working with ladies?

617
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:20,524
- Acting is acting, right?
- That's right.

618
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,195
I think that's really admirable.

619
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:25,204
Me, myself, I can't get into it.

620
01:26:25,272 --> 01:26:28,707
But, anyway, good luck
and say hello to Simon for me.

621
01:26:28,775 --> 01:26:31,506
- Good seeing you.
- Sure. Thanks.

622
01:26:31,578 --> 01:26:33,010
By the way...

623
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:36,908
what's the film about?

624
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:38,713
That's good.

625
01:26:38,786 --> 01:26:41,050
We need more comedians
in our business.

626
01:26:41,122 --> 01:26:42,612
Good luck.

627
01:26:47,629 --> 01:26:49,062
Very nice.

628
01:26:50,466 --> 01:26:52,899
What can I get you?
Jack Daniels?

629
01:26:54,136 --> 01:26:57,072
How about Jake Scully...

630
01:26:57,139 --> 01:26:58,572
straight up?

631
01:27:00,143 --> 01:27:01,576
Very funny.

632
01:27:12,658 --> 01:27:14,091
Hello.

633
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:23,259
Listen, Holly...

634
01:27:23,335 --> 01:27:25,269
I don't want to talk
any more business.

635
01:27:25,337 --> 01:27:26,771
Yeah, well...

636
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,272
Listen.

637
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:29,774
Lie down.

638
01:27:36,181 --> 01:27:38,775
We had one of these
in "Star Whores."

639
01:27:39,853 --> 01:27:42,447
There's something I gotta tell you.

640
01:27:42,522 --> 01:27:44,114
You're married.

641
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:46,125
- What then?
- I'm not a producer.

642
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:48,127
You're not a producer.

643
01:27:49,863 --> 01:27:52,957
l... Hold up. I'm not...

644
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:55,968
Just a second.

645
01:27:57,371 --> 01:28:00,808
I'm not interested
in making a film with you.

646
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:06,139
- What are you interested in then?
- You.

647
01:28:07,383 --> 01:28:11,319
I saw you in the house
those other nights.

648
01:28:11,387 --> 01:28:12,821
What house?

649
01:28:14,057 --> 01:28:16,992
You know,
that show that you put on...

650
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,824
with the masturbation routine
and all the diamonds and everything.

651
01:28:19,897 --> 01:28:21,832
I was watching you from here.

652
01:28:25,235 --> 01:28:29,435
You were the girl in the window.
That wasn't Gloria. That was you.

653
01:28:30,742 --> 01:28:32,209
What's it to you?

654
01:28:32,277 --> 01:28:36,180
Just tell me if I'm right.
That was you in the Revelle house.

655
01:28:36,248 --> 01:28:37,682
Right?

656
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:42,682
I'm not saying that it was me,
and I'm not saying that it wasn't me.

657
01:28:42,754 --> 01:28:45,986
I'm saying,
why are you interested in knowing?

658
01:28:52,264 --> 01:28:57,862
I think that one of my crazy friends
has played a practical joke on me.

659
01:28:57,938 --> 01:29:00,202
You know how it is
with the idle rich.

660
01:29:03,777 --> 01:29:08,876
Tell me, were you the girl
in the house?

661
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:10,542
- Yeah, that was me.
- I knew it.

662
01:29:10,618 --> 01:29:13,553
How did this thing get set up?

663
01:29:13,622 --> 01:29:17,058
Tell me just to satisfy my curiosity.

664
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:21,222
One of my crazy friends set this up,
but I don't know who.

665
01:29:21,297 --> 01:29:22,730
Who hired you?

666
01:29:22,799 --> 01:29:26,065
- You were the one I was playing to?
- Yeah.

667
01:29:26,136 --> 01:29:29,572
- And there's no part for me.
- I'm sorry.

668
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:31,903
- This whole thing was a joke.
- Yeah.

669
01:29:31,975 --> 01:29:33,910
It was a practical joke on me.

670
01:29:33,978 --> 01:29:37,072
Did Sam Bouchard
set this whole thing up?

671
01:29:37,147 --> 01:29:39,082
Did he hire you
to do your routine?

672
01:29:39,149 --> 01:29:41,414
He didn't tell me his name.

673
01:29:41,486 --> 01:29:44,922
Whoever you talked to,
what did he say?

674
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:50,256
This guy called me up and said
he had seen my self-help routine...

675
01:29:50,327 --> 01:29:51,919
in 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

676
01:29:51,996 --> 01:29:55,262
and he wanted to hire me
to do it in private.

677
01:29:55,333 --> 01:29:59,770
He said that he had this friend
who got off on peeping.

678
01:29:59,839 --> 01:30:03,775
- He didn't tell you who he was?
- No. He didn't tell me his name.

679
01:30:03,842 --> 01:30:07,107
He just sent a messenger over
with money...

680
01:30:07,178 --> 01:30:10,115
and with a card key...

681
01:30:10,183 --> 01:30:12,275
and a wig.

682
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,784
Please don't leave.

683
01:30:13,854 --> 01:30:17,290
Just stay here for a second.

684
01:30:17,357 --> 01:30:18,791
Can you hold on?

685
01:30:21,696 --> 01:30:23,288
- Hello.
- Lf's Sam.

686
01:30:23,364 --> 01:30:26,459
- How are you doing? Can you hold on?
- Sure.

687
01:30:26,534 --> 01:30:27,968
Hold on.

688
01:30:29,371 --> 01:30:31,134
Please, listen to this guy's voice.

689
01:30:31,206 --> 01:30:34,974
Tell me if he's the one
that hired you. Please.

690
01:30:35,045 --> 01:30:38,138
Hello. I'm sorry. You got me
in the shower. How are you doing?

691
01:30:38,213 --> 01:30:42,481
- I'm afraid I got some bad news, pal.
- What's that?

692
01:30:42,552 --> 01:30:44,816
Seaffle Rep and I
had some arfisfic differences.

693
01:30:44,888 --> 01:30:46,823
I'm gonna be heading back fo L.A.

694
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:50,486
So I guess you'll have fo find
anofher place fo crash.

695
01:30:50,561 --> 01:30:51,995
That's him.

696
01:30:52,064 --> 01:30:54,495
- You gof some company fhere?
- Actually, I do.

697
01:30:54,564 --> 01:30:58,160
It's kind of a bad time to talk.
You want to call back in 15 minutes?

698
01:30:58,235 --> 01:31:01,671
- Yeah...
- That was the guy who hired you?

699
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:03,502
- Yes, that was him.
- Are you sure?

700
01:31:03,574 --> 01:31:05,668
- Yes, I'm sure that was him.
- Listen.

701
01:31:05,744 --> 01:31:09,338
- God, you're really sick.
- Listen to me very carefully.

702
01:31:09,413 --> 01:31:13,009
I am not a film producer,
and I am not a rich kid.

703
01:31:13,085 --> 01:31:14,677
No, you're a jerk.

704
01:31:14,753 --> 01:31:17,187
Holly, please listen to me
for a second.

705
01:31:18,758 --> 01:31:23,695
You were hired to do two nights' work,
to do your routine and leave.

706
01:31:23,763 --> 01:31:25,355
- Is that true?
- Yes.

707
01:31:25,431 --> 01:31:27,866
- Do you know why?
- You just told me why.

708
01:31:27,935 --> 01:31:30,871
You just told me some guy
was playing a joke on you.

709
01:31:30,938 --> 01:31:32,702
He wasn't playing a joke on you?

710
01:31:32,774 --> 01:31:35,709
- Do you want to tell me what it was?
- Yes.

711
01:31:35,777 --> 01:31:38,212
The truth.

712
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,714
The truth is a woman was murdered.

713
01:31:42,618 --> 01:31:46,384
It's not funny. A woman was murdered.
You and I were set up by a murderer.

714
01:31:46,455 --> 01:31:48,548
He wanted to be sure
I witnessed the murder.

715
01:31:48,624 --> 01:31:50,558
That's why he hired you
to do your routine.

716
01:31:50,626 --> 01:31:53,061
Meanwhile, he arranged it
so that I would be watching.

717
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:56,065
He wanted me to think that the girl
who lived there, Gloria Revelle...

718
01:31:56,133 --> 01:31:57,567
was the one getting off.

719
01:31:57,635 --> 01:32:00,897
Meanwhile, he thought I would watch
and keep watching.

720
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:03,735
Holly, are you listening to me?

721
01:32:03,807 --> 01:32:06,241
Yes.
I don't understand what you've said.

722
01:32:06,308 --> 01:32:08,573
Listen, he's a murderer!

723
01:32:08,645 --> 01:32:11,240
The man who hired you is a murderer!
Come here.

724
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:14,208
Please, come here.

725
01:32:14,285 --> 01:32:16,185
Do you remember
where you did your routine?

726
01:32:16,253 --> 01:32:18,779
- Yes.
- You see that house down there?

727
01:32:18,856 --> 01:32:20,915
- That window is where you were, right?
- Yes.

728
01:32:29,268 --> 01:32:31,759
- Now do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

729
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:35,433
I understand you're sick and you're
a liar and you need professional help.

730
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:37,601
- I do not like being yelled at!
- I'm sorry.

731
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,771
I should have known when you told me
I had a terrific smile.

732
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:42,281
No real producer would tell me that
in a million years.

733
01:32:42,349 --> 01:32:44,214
Get out of my way.

734
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:46,220
- What?
- Just come with me to the police.

735
01:32:46,287 --> 01:32:49,620
To the police? Are you crazy?
Listen to me, you weirdo...

736
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:52,284
- A woman was murdered!
- I'm leaving! Don't follow me home!

737
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,191
I have friends
who will break your legsl

738
01:32:55,363 --> 01:32:57,763
Let go of me! God!

739
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:00,302
You weirdol
There are so many weird people.

740
01:33:13,049 --> 01:33:15,677
Can I have the Hollywood
Police Department, please?

741
01:33:15,751 --> 01:33:17,685
Fucking freaky actors.

742
01:33:17,753 --> 01:33:19,483
That's what there is here.

743
01:33:19,556 --> 01:33:22,320
Masochistic directors.

744
01:33:22,392 --> 01:33:25,485
I should have known when he didn't
even know what a come shot was.

745
01:33:27,064 --> 01:33:29,157
Yeah, Detective McLean, please.

746
01:33:36,242 --> 01:33:38,506
Excuse me.
Stop, please.

747
01:33:39,744 --> 01:33:42,009
Thank you very much, ladyl

748
01:33:45,885 --> 01:33:47,319
I was set up.

749
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:52,548
Yeah, Hollywood's busiest
sex offender.

750
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,561
Cut it out.
Just listen to me for a minute.

751
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,687
I got something important
to tell you.

752
01:33:57,765 --> 01:33:59,596
I know who killed Gloria Revelle.

753
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,328
Is this a confession?

754
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:04,037
Listen.

755
01:34:05,107 --> 01:34:07,041
Just pay attention.

756
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:09,635
A few days ago I was looking
for an apartment.

757
01:34:09,712 --> 01:34:13,042
Do you know any sublets
that would be available right away?

758
01:34:13,113 --> 01:34:14,877
I'll check around.

759
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:18,716
I noficed fhis guy,
Sam Bouchard.

760
01:34:18,787 --> 01:34:21,382

Anyway, now I realize

768
01:34:46,317 --> 01:34:48,514
Shit.
What a fool I am.

769
01:34:48,588 --> 01:34:50,488
And you know what the part was?

770
01:34:50,555 --> 01:34:52,114
I'm listening.

771
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:54,625
The part of the witness.

772
01:34:54,694 --> 01:34:58,825
He fold me fhere was fhis neighbor fhaf

773
01:34:58,899 --> 01:35:01,992

774
01:35:02,069 --> 01:35:04,161
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.

775
01:35:04,237 --> 01:35:07,468
He knew I would keep looking.
And if wasn'f Gloria.

776
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:10,306
If was Holly doing her roufine.
Thaf's why I never saw her face.

777
01:35:12,013 --> 01:35:15,176
You sound like a conspiracy nut:
plots all around you.

778
01:35:15,249 --> 01:35:17,444
Please, just listen to me
for a second.

779
01:35:19,019 --> 01:35:22,318
Sam Bouchard is Alexander Revelle.

780
01:35:23,424 --> 01:35:25,654
He hired fhe Indian
fo follow Gloria...

781
01:35:25,727 --> 01:35:28,719
and snafch her purse
and sfeal fhe card key fo her house...

782
01:35:28,796 --> 01:35:31,493
and fhen sneak inside.

783
01:35:31,567 --> 01:35:34,035
Then when she gof home...

784
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:38,096
the Indian opened fhe blinds
so I could see him kill her.

785
01:35:38,173 --> 01:35:43,077
Alexander Revelle set me up
in this house to witness the murder.

786
01:35:44,179 --> 01:35:46,478
He hired a porno acfress
fo be fhe baif.

787
01:35:49,754 --> 01:35:52,552
Can I have a ride, please?

788
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:54,557
Thanks a lot, you jerks!

789
01:36:04,903 --> 01:36:06,370
Oh, my God.

790
01:36:06,439 --> 01:36:10,169
I've been trying to build a case
against the husband all along...

791
01:36:10,242 --> 01:36:12,177
but the reason
it hasn't panned out...

792
01:36:12,244 --> 01:36:16,148
is because of your testimony
that Gloria was killed by an Indian.

793
01:36:16,215 --> 01:36:19,151
That's just it! Don't you see?
That's what he wanted!

794
01:36:19,219 --> 01:36:21,016
It looks like a burglary,
but it's a murder...

795
01:36:21,088 --> 01:36:23,522
with me set up
to be the witnessl

796
01:36:23,591 --> 01:36:26,455
I'm Alexander Revelle's alibi.

797
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:32,689
Listen. Stop, all right?

798
01:36:32,766 --> 01:36:37,636
Just stop! Right therel

799
01:36:38,707 --> 01:36:41,198
There has been an accident
up there.

800
01:36:41,276 --> 01:36:44,711
- Those people are probably very hurt.
- Slow down, lady.

801
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:47,009
- Nobody's bothered to stop.
- Get in the car.

802
01:36:47,082 --> 01:36:49,016
It sounds crazy to me.

803
01:36:50,118 --> 01:36:53,088
I know, but it's the truth.

804
01:36:56,126 --> 01:36:58,651
Maybe you better come down here.

805
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,482
Pull it up. That's it.
Pull your car right up there.

806
01:37:21,187 --> 01:37:24,486
Stay in your car, please.
There's nothing to look at.

807
01:37:24,557 --> 01:37:26,684
We'll have it cleaned up
in a couple minutes.

808
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:32,189
Get back in your car, sir.

809
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:36,933
Officer, there's a woman being killed
in that Ford Bronco right there.

810
01:37:38,605 --> 01:37:41,301
He's killing her. He just hit her
in the back of the head.

811
01:37:41,374 --> 01:37:43,104
We gotta do something
to help her.

812
01:37:43,177 --> 01:37:47,045
- Get back in your car.
- He's killing her. He hit her.

813
01:37:48,715 --> 01:37:51,276
- I don't have time to run you in.
- Please!

814
01:37:51,352 --> 01:37:53,479
He's getting away.
Please call somebody on your radio.

815
01:37:53,555 --> 01:37:56,523
Don't you understand?
I saw him killing her!

816
01:37:56,590 --> 01:37:59,059
- You fucking idiot!
- All right, that's it, buddy.

817
01:37:59,127 --> 01:38:01,561
- You're coming with me.
- Call Detective McLean.

818
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:03,393
- He knows all about this.
- All right.

819
01:38:04,967 --> 01:38:06,798
Son of a...

820
01:38:06,869 --> 01:38:08,632
Come here, you son of a bitch!

821
01:42:29,255 --> 01:42:30,687
Are you okay?

822
01:43:48,843 --> 01:43:50,435
Look what you did.

823
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:55,273
You ruined my surprise ending!

824
01:43:55,348 --> 01:44:00,286
I gave you your part:
the witness.

825
01:44:00,355 --> 01:44:04,189
You were perfect.
You played it to a T.

826
01:44:04,259 --> 01:44:06,785
But that was it.

827
01:44:06,863 --> 01:44:08,296
End of part.

828
01:44:09,532 --> 01:44:11,464
Wrap Jake Scully.

829
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:17,468
You had to play the hero...

830
01:44:17,539 --> 01:44:21,305
improvise all this crap
about finding a body double...

831
01:44:21,376 --> 01:44:23,971
and unmasking the Indian.

832
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:29,712
But you didn't think it through.

833
01:44:29,786 --> 01:44:34,451
Sometimes heroes
come to tragic ends.

834
01:44:35,893 --> 01:44:39,488
What's the matter?
A little short of breath?

835
01:44:42,534 --> 01:44:44,229
What a terrible way to die.

836
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:47,696
Especially when you're
so claustrophobic.

837
01:44:48,807 --> 01:44:50,241
Wait a minute.

838
01:44:50,309 --> 01:44:53,142
I'll give you another take.

839
01:44:55,481 --> 01:44:59,009
The only problem is
you've got to act.

840
01:45:05,325 --> 01:45:06,758
Come on.

841
01:45:07,427 --> 01:45:09,396
Action.

842
01:45:14,669 --> 01:45:16,103
And action.

843
01:45:24,312 --> 01:45:26,371
Cut. Get him out of here.
Move the camera out.

844
01:45:26,448 --> 01:45:28,779
Joe, give me a hand.
Jake, take it easy.

845
01:45:28,851 --> 01:45:30,842
What's going on?

846
01:45:30,919 --> 01:45:32,853
We're getting you out.
That's all right.

847
01:45:32,921 --> 01:45:34,854
We got you. Let go.
Don't worry about it.

848
01:45:34,922 --> 01:45:37,517
- Don't worry about nothing.
- It's all right. We're here.

849
01:45:37,593 --> 01:45:40,859
Give him some air.
Talk to me.

850
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:44,161
Say something.
Walk it off. Just go for a walk.

851
01:45:44,234 --> 01:45:46,600
Just relax. Just breathe in.

852
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:49,367
All right, that's good.
There you go.

853
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,374
What's the matter, babe?

854
01:45:51,442 --> 01:45:55,072
Boy, you had us scared there.
What's the problem?

855
01:45:55,147 --> 01:45:57,081
Wait a minute.

856
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:04,715
- Get away from me.
- Babe, just relax.

857
01:46:04,792 --> 01:46:06,884
- We're just trying to help you.
- I know.

858
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,792
I can help myself.

859
01:46:09,862 --> 01:46:14,163
Listen, Scully,
why don't you cool off?

860
01:46:14,234 --> 01:46:17,863
Go on home,
and we'll shoot this another time.

861
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:19,372
All right?

862
01:46:21,408 --> 01:46:23,570
Don't lie to me.

863
01:46:23,645 --> 01:46:25,907
If I don't get this shot,
you'll fire me.

864
01:46:27,681 --> 01:46:30,741
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would I do a thing like that?

865
01:46:38,026 --> 01:46:42,759
Save the speech, Rubin. I know all about
your personal commitment to the actors.

866
01:46:42,831 --> 01:46:46,427
I'm a little claustrophobic.
You'II work around it, right?

867
01:46:46,502 --> 01:46:48,436
Yeah, that's right.

868
01:46:52,441 --> 01:46:54,636
- I don't like your attitude.
- Yeah?

869
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:58,147
If I get this shot,
you'll like it a lot better, right?

870
01:47:10,863 --> 01:47:12,296
Let's do it!

871
01:47:21,106 --> 01:47:23,598
You better get it right this time.

872
01:47:23,676 --> 01:47:26,339
You're one pain in the ass
I don't need.

873
01:47:28,549 --> 01:47:31,311
- Okay, Joe.
- Roll sound. Quiet.

874
01:47:31,383 --> 01:47:33,648
And action I

875
01:47:41,529 --> 01:47:42,996
You bastard!

876
01:47:43,063 --> 01:47:44,690
Don't be so melodramatic.

877
01:47:50,104 --> 01:47:51,662
Kill!

878
01:48:02,585 --> 01:48:04,747
What are you doing?

879
01:48:04,822 --> 01:48:07,449
- What am I doing? I'm saving you.
- From who?

880
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:12,895
- From... The Indian was Sam Bouchard.
- Wait a minute.

881
01:48:12,964 --> 01:48:16,127
Am I missing something?
Is there somebody here that I don't see?

882
01:48:16,201 --> 01:48:18,362
Yes! The dog knocked him in.

883
01:48:18,436 --> 01:48:20,370
Come look. Come here.

884
01:48:21,573 --> 01:48:23,905
Look, he must have knocked him in.
He went...

885
01:48:23,975 --> 01:48:28,777
I thought it belonged to Gloria, but
it must have belonged to the husband.

886
01:48:28,848 --> 01:48:32,477
That's why he never barked at the Indian
when he tried to sneak in the house.

887
01:48:32,551 --> 01:48:35,248
I think you're absolutely right.
We should go to the police.

888
01:48:35,322 --> 01:48:37,720
- Really? You believe me?
- Yes. I believe you.

889
01:48:37,789 --> 01:48:41,317
I believe you are a number one sicko
and should be put away for life!

890
01:48:41,393 --> 01:48:43,691
I know all about you guys.

891
01:48:43,762 --> 01:48:46,732
I've seen about you
on late-night television.

892
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,325
You're one of those necrophiliacs,
a corpse fucker!

893
01:48:49,401 --> 01:48:51,927
- I am not.
- Yesl I turn you on, all right.

894
01:48:52,005 --> 01:48:53,996
The only problem is that
I'm still movingl

895
01:48:54,074 --> 01:48:56,634
Unconscious is good,
but dead is better, right?

896
01:48:58,845 --> 01:49:00,279
Are you all right?

897
01:49:01,348 --> 01:49:02,782
Here, take my hand.

898
01:49:03,751 --> 01:49:05,617
Do not touch me.

899
01:49:05,686 --> 01:49:08,087
I'm not dead yet.

900
01:49:11,093 --> 01:49:16,122
I know this all seems crazy,
but I'm trying to help you.

901
01:49:16,199 --> 01:49:19,134
Are you gonna stay in there
for the rest of your life?

902
01:50:03,583 --> 01:50:05,517
Freeze.
Don't move your hand, Jake.

903
01:50:05,586 --> 01:50:07,178
- How does that look?
- It looks great.

904
01:50:07,253 --> 01:50:10,850
Good. Terrific. Hold that move.
Let's 86 the bat.

905
01:50:10,924 --> 01:50:14,190
That's a wrap on the bat.
Get the bat out.

906
01:50:14,262 --> 01:50:17,528
- I gotta hold the hand really still.
- Help him out.

907
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:21,036
- Turn the water off.
- Can I slip out?

908
01:50:21,102 --> 01:50:24,368
Wait till we get the bar in there.
Wait till we get the stand in here.

909
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:28,537
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Between the bottom two fingers.

910
01:50:32,949 --> 01:50:35,713
Good. Okay, sweetheart,
you can slide out.

911
01:50:35,785 --> 01:50:38,049
Don't move the hand.
Freeze the hand.

912
01:50:38,121 --> 01:50:40,056
Makeup.
Let's get a touch-up for Jake.

913
01:50:40,124 --> 01:50:42,558
Don't move the hand.
Keep the hand very still.

914
01:50:42,627 --> 01:50:44,220
Excuse me.

915
01:50:44,296 --> 01:50:46,229
Don't move the bar!

916
01:50:48,133 --> 01:50:49,896
- I'm sorry.
- Did the bar move?

917
01:50:49,968 --> 01:50:51,399
That's okay.

918
01:50:52,903 --> 01:50:55,736
- You're doing a great job.
- Did I flash the teeth long enough?

919
01:50:55,806 --> 01:50:59,243
Best teeth flashing I've ever seen.
It looked beautiful, babe.

920
01:50:59,311 --> 01:51:01,245
I'm so glad
I fired that other asshole.

921
01:51:01,313 --> 01:51:04,407
This part was made for you.
I mean it. You look sensational.

922
01:51:04,483 --> 01:51:07,577
- This bar is falling.
- That looks good.

923
01:51:07,653 --> 01:51:09,245
- You holding up?
- Yeah.

924
01:51:09,321 --> 01:51:11,916
Just a little longer.
Okay, girls, step out. Step back.

925
01:51:11,991 --> 01:51:13,924
Let's bring in the body double.

926
01:51:13,993 --> 01:51:16,587
- Thanks.
- The hair looks good.

927
01:51:16,664 --> 01:51:18,927
Is that as hot
as that water gets?

928
01:51:18,998 --> 01:51:20,933
Slide in there, sweetheart.

929
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,765
- Don't move the bar. It's important.
- I know.

930
01:51:23,837 --> 01:51:26,601
Hi. I'm Mindy.
Pleased to meet you.

931
01:51:26,674 --> 01:51:29,769
- Nice to meet you.
- Listen, be very, very careful.

932
01:51:29,844 --> 01:51:31,937
My breasts are very tender.

933
01:51:32,013 --> 01:51:33,777
I've got my period.

934
01:51:35,016 --> 01:51:36,450
We good here?

935
01:51:38,521 --> 01:51:41,786
I'm gonna...
Just bring your body up like this.

936
01:51:41,857 --> 01:51:43,791
My hand is right here.
I can't move my hand.

937
01:51:43,859 --> 01:51:46,454
Keep your hand exactly still.
Let's shoot it.

938
01:51:46,530 --> 01:51:48,794
Let's slide the bar out.

939
01:51:48,865 --> 01:51:51,129
Drop the camera.
Let's get the camera down.

940
01:51:52,536 --> 01:51:55,131
Wait till we're in position.

941
01:51:55,206 --> 01:51:56,967
Can you bring your body
up to my hand?

942
01:52:01,545 --> 01:52:04,378
Quiet, please!
I'm trying to think.

943
01:52:18,564 --> 01:52:21,499
You're gonna get a lot of dates
when this comes out.

944
01:52:21,567 --> 01:52:23,159
Here we go. Action.

945
01:52:23,236 --> 01:52:24,828
Action with the hand.

946
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:30,005
Great action.

947
01:52:30,076 --> 01:52:32,011
Is that too hard?
