1
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,010
(crashing thunder)

2
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,214
(howling wind)

3
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,408
(men shouting)

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,616
(chorus) A sail! A sail!

5
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,730
It's the winged lion!

6
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,375
The lightning reveals it now.

7
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,815
A trumpet blast!

8
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,618
(boom)

9
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,611
The cannon has sounded!

10
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,293
It's the General's ship!

11
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,416
First it sinks down,

12
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,292
then it rears up.

13
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,094
Its prow rises from the waves.

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,771
It's hidden in the clouds and the sea,

15
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,979
then appears in the lightning's flash.

16
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,089
Lightning! Thunder! Whirlpools!

17
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,138
Stormy winds and thunderbolts!

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,619
(shouting)

19
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,453
The waves quake, the winds quake.

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,970
The foundations and pinnacles quake.

21
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,929
A grim, blind, whirling spirit

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,333
cleaves the air.

23
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,657
God shakes the white heavens
like a gloomy curtain.

24
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,770
All is smoke! All is fire!

25
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,418
The horrible soot turns to fire

26
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,697
and then dies.

27
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,658
(crashes and booms)

28
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,696
(whistling and explosions)

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,615
(massive blast)

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,098
The universe writhes,

31
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,171
the phantom north wind
rushes through the passes.

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,772
(dramatic trumpet fanfare)

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,493
Titanic trumpets blare out in the sky.

34
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:50,577
God, lightning in the storm!

35
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:56,815
God, the smile of the shore!

36
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,492
Save the vessel and the flag

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,610
of the Venetian destiny!

38
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,292
Thou, who rules the stars and Fate!

39
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,656
Thou, who governs the world and sky!

40
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:32,776
Grant that the faithful anchor,

41
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:39,254
rest on the bottom of the calmed sea.

42
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,093
Her mainsail's torn away!

43
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,171
Her prow is hurtling towards the reef!

44
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,217
(crowd) Help! Help!

45
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,659
May the stormy seas be her tomb.

46
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,848
(crowd) He is saved!

47
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,174
He is saved!

48
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,135
Lower the small boats!

49
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,098
All hands to the ropes! Hurry!

50
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,058
Row with all your might! To the shore!

51
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,730
To the landing place! Disembark

52
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,338
Hurrah!

53
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,298
Rejoice!

54
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:41,059
The infidels are buried
at the bottom of the sea.

55
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,811
Heavens be thanked.

56
00:04:48,540 --> 00:05:00,452
Our weapons and the wrath of the storm
defeated them!

57
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,128
(crowd) Long live Othello!

58
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,495
Long live Othello!

59
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,378
Victory! Victory!

60
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,252
Victory is ours!

61
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,174
Victory! Victory!

62
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,093
Slaughter!

63
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,451
Lost souls, crushed,

64
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,330
buried in horridness,

65
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,333
in horridness,

66
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,850
in horridness.

67
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,329
(cheering and applause)

68
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,694
(excited shouting)

69
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:10,295
- Rodrigo, what are you thinking of?
- Of drowning myself.

70
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:18,458
Only fools kill themselves for love.

71
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,009
How can I win her?.

72
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,379
Let time work for you.

73
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,617
The fair Desdemona,

74
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,614
whom you secretly adore,

75
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:42,494
will soon loathe the embrace
of that repulsive savage.

76
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,850
Although I pretend to be loyal to him,
I hate the Moor!

77
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,218
There is a reason. Here it is.

78
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,689
Look.

79
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,738
You see that foppish captain down there?

80
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,815
He usurped my rank,

81
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:10,293
earned in a hundred bloody battles.

82
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,211
Such was Othello's will.

83
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,490
And I remain

84
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,128
his lordship,

85
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:37,256
the Moor's ensign.

86
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,213
Oh, if you listen to me.

87
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,777
(shouting and whooping)

88
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,818
(drumming)

89
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,734
(dancers whooping)

90
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,375
(drum roll)

91
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,378
(cheering)

92
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,169
(cheering whooping and applause)

93
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,170
(cheering and laughter)

94
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,574
- Your cup, Captain.
- No more wine.

95
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,777
- Just another sip.
- No!

96
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,773
Come, today Cyprus is in a frenzy.

97
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,500
It's a joyous night!

98
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,256
No, one cup put my head afire.

99
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,173
But you must drink

100
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,937
to the marriage of Othello and Desdemona.

101
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:57,135
Her beauty and charm
have won her the hearts of all on the island.

102
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,454
Jago, sing her praises.

103
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,454
Listen to him. I am a mere bystander.

104
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,375
And she is beyond praise.

105
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,850
- Beware of that Cassio!
- Why?

106
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,492
He's a young and sly seducer
who could get in your way.

107
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:28,374
But if he gets drunk, he is lost.

108
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,132
Get him to drink

109
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,497
Bring more wine!

110
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,730
(cheering)

111
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,410
Drink and be merry

112
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,938
before joy and wine are spent.

113
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:14,576
This noble wine befuddles the mind.

114
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,736
Let all who have once succumbed
to the wild pleasures of the grapes

115
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,688
drink with me, drink with me!

116
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,569
Drink with me! Drink with me!

117
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,289
Drink!

118
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,090
Drink, drink!. Drink with me!

119
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:43,415
(crowd) Let all who have once succumbed
to the wild pleasures of the grapes

120
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,016
Drink with me! Drink with me!

121
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,219
- (Jago) Drink, drink!
- Drink with me!

122
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,214
Drink!

123
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,019
Drink! Drink!

124
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,295
Drink with me!

125
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,416
Another sip and he'll be drunk

126
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,769
(Jago) Men who don't drink are cowards.

127
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,534
My heart is an open book

128
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,009
Cowards and deceivers.

129
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,490
- I don't fear the truth.
- Drink, drink!.

130
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,935
I don't fear the truth.

131
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,694
- Drink with me!
- I don't fear the truth.

132
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,134
(crowd) Drink, drink!. Drink with me!

133
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,530
Drink, drink, drink, drink!

134
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,850
- (Jago ) Drink, drink!.
- (crowd) Drink with me!

135
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,851
- (Jago ) Drink, drink!.
- (crowd) Drink with me!

136
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,059
Drink!

137
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,099
Drink, drink with me!

138
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,379
(hens squawking)

139
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,534
Captain, you must stand guard on the ramparts.

140
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,531
Let's go.

141
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,528
- What do I see?
- Cassio is drinking himself to sleep.

142
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,577
Othello must know.

143
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,696
Let's go.

144
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,090
- (crowd) Ha ha!
- Who's laughing?

145
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,932
I'm laughing at a drunkard.

146
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,056
Mind your words, you scoundrel.

147
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,688
Drunken rascal!

148
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,658
No one can save you now.

149
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,654
Please hold your hand, sir.

150
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,495
I'll split your brains if you interfere.

151
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,220
The words of a drunkard.

152
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,893
Me, a drunkard?

153
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,255
Go to the harbour and cry, ''Mutiny'!"'

154
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,210
Spread confusion, sound the alarm.

155
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,099
Brothers, stop this fighting.

156
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,219
Montano is wounded. Stop, I say!

157
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,648
He can't be stopped.

158
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,176
(panicked shouting)

159
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:12,771
Sound the alarm! He is possessed!

160
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,408
(swords clashing ferociously)

161
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:33,258
Put down your swords!

162
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,214
What's happening?

163
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,055
Have you turned into Saracens?

164
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,413
To be fighting amongst yourselves

165
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,378
Like mad dogs?

166
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,493
Honest Jago,

167
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,209
for the love you bear me,

168
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,289
speak!

169
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,458
I don't know.

170
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:22,175
One moment all friends happy and smiling.

171
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:31,093
The next, as if some evil star

had bewitched them,

172
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,209
their swords out, fighting with fury.

173
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:46,608
I wish I had lost the legs

174
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,136
that brought me here to witness it.

175
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,374
Cassio, how could you so forget yourself?

176
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,812
Your lordship, forgive me,

177
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,938
I don't know what to say.

178
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,172
- Montano.
- I am wounded.

179
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,413
Wounded? By heaven, my blood is boiling.

180
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,052
Anger has chased away our guardian angel.

181
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,778
Cassio, you are no longer captain.

182
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,337
Oh, sweet triumph!

183
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:36,612
Jago, go and restore peace to this troubled city.

184
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,899
Someone help Montano.

185
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,650
Return to your homes.

186
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:57,531
I shall not move from here

187
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:06,210
until I see this place cleared.

188
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,055
Already in the deep of night

189
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:46,011
all tumult has been silenced.

190
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:53,295
Already my throbbing heart

191
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,535
finds solace in this embrace

192
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,774
and recovers.

193
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:12,452
Let war engulf the world,

194
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:24,931
if her endless wrath

195
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:31,289
comes such boundless love.

196
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,488
My noble warrior!

197
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,619
How many sighs,

198
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,058
how much sorrow,

199
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,338
and how much hope

200
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,937
have led us

201
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,818
to this tender embrace?

202
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:13,733
How sweet are our whispers!

203
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,975
Do you remember?

204
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:36,449
(Desdemona voiceover)
When you told of your life in exile,

205
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:43,139
of daring deeds and many misfortunes,

206
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:51,856
and I listened with rapture in my soul,

207
00:22:52,020 --> 00:23:00,928
in terror, with ecstasy in my heart?

208
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:09,417
I told of the clash of arms, fierce battles
and the brave flight into the mortal breach.

209
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,890
The assault,

210
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,575
clinging like ivy to the ramparts,

211
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,095
the target of whistling arrows.

212
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:28,333
Then you led me to the flaming deserts,

213
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:35,850
the burning sands of your native land.

214
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:42,289
You told me of your sufferings,

215
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:51,129
when you were sold in chains to slavery.

216
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:58,058
(Othello voiceover)
Your fair face, your sighing lips,

217
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:08,289
ennobled my story with tears.

218
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:18,415
Over my dark shadows, glory, heaven

219
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,612
and the stars descended to bless.

220
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,295
(Desdemona voiceover)
I saw the beauty of your noble spirit

221
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,258
beyond the darkness of your brow.

222
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:38,691
(Othello voiceover)
You loved me for my misfortunes.

223
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:49,370
And I loved you that you did pity me.

224
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:56,776
(Desdemona voiceover)
I loved you for the dangers you endured.

225
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:07,459
You loved me that I did pity you.

226
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:13,058
- You loved me.
- And you loved me.

227
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:26,657
- And I loved you that you did pity me.
- That I did pity you.

228
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:40,331
Let death come and sweep me away

229
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:50,296
in the ecstasy of this embrace,
the supreme moment.

230
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,579
So complete is my soul's joy

231
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:05,376
that I fear, I fear never to know again

232
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,568
Such a divine contentment

233
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:21,218
in the unknown future of my destiny.

234
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,735
(Desdemona voiceover)
May heaven banish all sorrow

235
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:38,696
and our love endure the passing of years.

236
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:46,216
(Othello voiceover)
To your prayers,

237
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:55,937
may the powers above say, ''Amen''.

238
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:04,895
(Desdemona) May it respond, ''Amen''.

239
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:14,133
Ah, joy washes over me so fiercely,

240
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,928
I fear I will suffocate.

241
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,693
A kiss.

242
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,090
Othello!

243
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,894
A kiss.

244
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:08,810
Another kiss.

245
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:25,138
The stars sink into the sea.

246
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,969
(Desdemona) Night draws to a close.

247
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,815
Come!

248
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:57,050
- Venus shines on high.
- Othello!

249
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,092
(gentle lapping of the sea)

250
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,011
(men talking)

251
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,850
Listen to me.

252
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:38,492
You know that Desdemona rules our ruler.

253
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,930
He lives only for her.

254
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:52,934
Beg that generous soul to plead for you

255
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,409
and you'll surely be pardoned.

256
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,811
But how can I approach her?.

257
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:13,218
She often strolls here
at about this hour with my wife.

258
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,940
Wait for her.

259
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:27,694
There lies your path to salvation.

260
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,339
Go.

261
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,691
(birds chirruping)

262
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,736
Go! I see your end already.

263
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,134
Your evil genius drives you on.

264
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,974
And I am your evil genius.

265
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,090
Mine follows me,

266
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:05,451
implacable God!

267
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,939
I believe in a cruel God,

268
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:34,733
who created me in his image,

269
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:43,539
and in my wrath I speak his name.

270
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,893
Born from some vile atom or germ,

271
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,258
vile I am.

272
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:12,295
I'm evil because I am a man

273
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,376
and I feel within me the primeval slime.

274
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,170
Yes.

275
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:34,492
This is my creed!

276
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,890
I believe as firmly

277
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:50,614
as any widow piously saying
her prayers in church,

278
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,978
that all the evil I think and do

279
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,339
was decreed for me by Fate.

280
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:15,612
I believe that the Righteous man
is just a buffoon

281
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:22,094
and that everything about him is false:

282
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:31,498
his tears, his sacrifices, his honour!

283
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,132
I believe man

284
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,772
to be the sport of an unjust destiny

285
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:53,336
from the germ of the cradle

286
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:07,855
to the worm of the grave.

287
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:41,291
After all this futility

288
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,577
comes death.

289
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,895
(voice echoing) And then?

290
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,329
Death and nothingness!

291
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:41,249
Heaven is an idle tale!

292
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,809
(roars with laughter)

293
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,419
Now to bring Othello here.

294
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,050
Help me, Satan, to achieve my end.

295
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,216
Chance favours me.

296
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,339
There he is. Now, to work!

297
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,130
(Cassio speaking quietly)

298
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,969
This saddens me!

299
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,608
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

300
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,494
I thought I was alone.

301
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,893
Idle words left my lips.

302
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,857
Is that Cassio leaving my wife?

303
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,580
Surely not.

304
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:29,098
That man fled like a culprit
when he saw you.

305
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,013
I think it was Cassio.

306
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,172
(birdsong)

307
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,537
(door hinges creak )

308
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:27,572
Beware, my lord, of jealousy!

309
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:35,737
It is a green-eyed monster, ghastly

310
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,772
and blind,

311
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:45,492
which poisons itself

312
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,938
with its own venom.

313
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,134
Its breast is ripped

314
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:02,853
by an ever-open wound.

315
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,658
You plunge me into misery!

316
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,655
But suspicion serves no purpose.

317
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,017
Probe before doubting.

318
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,177
After doubting, prove.

319
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,973
After proof...

320
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,055
..Othello has his own laws.

321
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,499
Away with both jealousy and love!

322
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:42,695
You make it easier for me to talk

323
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,012
(birdsong women singing happy folk song)

324
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,736
I don't yet talk of proof,

325
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:11,931
but, generous Othello, be vigilant.

326
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:19,290
Honest natures like yours
often don't see deceit.

327
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,610
Watch her well.

328
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,931
Listen when she talks.

329
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,172
One word may restore faith,

330
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:34,095
or confirm suspicion.

331
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,889
Here she comes. Watch her well.

332
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,419
(women singing happily)

333
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,690
(birdsong)

334
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,178
The brightness of the sky,

335
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,251
the scent of flowers...

336
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:41,338
This song completely captivates me.

337
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:51,452
If she is unfaithful, heaven mocks itself.

338
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:02,176
This song completely captivates me.

339
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,456
(women and children singing happily)

340
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,330
(singing continues)

341
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:04,495
I bring a petition from a man,

342
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,575
who has incurred your anger.

343
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,897
- Who is that?
- Cassio.

344
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:19,771
Were you talking with him just now?

345
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,329
The same.

346
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:32,330
And his repentance is so sincere,

347
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:39,497
that it deserves pardon.

348
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,256
For him I plead.

349
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:53,412
I beg you to forgive him.

350
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,138
Not now.

351
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,292
Don't refuse me.

352
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,538
Forgive him.

353
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,133
Not now!

354
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,979
Why is your voice troubled?

355
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,212
Are you unwell?

356
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,498
My forehead is burning.

357
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,211
The pain will go soon

358
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,771
if I bind it with this soft kerchief.

359
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,057
- I don't need that.
- Oh!

360
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,211
You are angry, my lord.

361
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,938
Leave me!

362
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:55,372
If I have unwittingly sinned against you,

363
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:03,811
my husband,

364
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:17,179
grant me the warm and sweet word
of your forgiveness.

365
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:23,017
(Othello) Perhaps because I don't stand
for betrayal in love.

366
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,895
- Give me that handkerchief.
- (Desdemona) I am your little one...

367
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,496
- What mischief do I read on your face?
-..humble and constant.

368
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,336
Perhaps I'm growing old.

369
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:43,257
But your lips sigh...

370
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:56,220
Perhaps because I'm black...

371
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:03,616
Look at my face...

372
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,736
(Jago) Give me that handkerchief!

373
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,012
(Desdemona)..see how I love you.

374
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,049
Perhaps I'm growing old.

375
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:21,135
(Othello) Perhaps because I'm black...

376
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:27,489
Let me lighten your heart,

377
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,575
Let me relieve your pain.

378
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:38,292
Let me relieve your pain.

379
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:51,211
Grant me the warm and sweet word
of your pardon.

380
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,335
Leave me!

381
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,614
I want to be alone.

382
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,374
For your own good, say nothing.
Understand?

383
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,540
Desdemona unfaithful?.

384
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,531
What a terrible thought!

385
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,577
My poison begins to work

386
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,057
Unfaithful to me? To me!

387
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,370
Suffer and bellow!

388
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,371
Dreadful! Dreadful!

389
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,451
Think no more about it.

390
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,975
You! Out of my sight!

391
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,769
You have crucified me!

392
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,219
Alas!

393
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:04,257
Nothing is worse than suspicion.

394
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:11,856
During her stolen hours of lust,

395
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,059
did I feel any ill omens?

396
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,658
No, I was happy.

397
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,009
I still knew nothing.

398
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:34,648
I could not taste on that divine body
that enchants me, nor on those lying lips...

399
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,859
the burning kisses of Cassio.

400
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:46,017
And now... and now...

401
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,651
Now and forever farewell,

402
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,095
sacred memories.

403
00:49:53,860 --> 00:50:00,413
Farewell content and tranquil mind.

404
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,858
Farewell brave troops,

405
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,376
great victories,

406
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,818
galloping horses, swift arrows.

407
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:24,851
(Othello) Farewell triumphant banner

408
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:29,730
and trumpets sounding reveille.

409
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:35,054
Farewell shouts and songs of battle.

410
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:42,137
This is the end of Othello's glory.

411
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,131
This is the end.

412
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,532
- This is the end!
 (sword clatters)

413
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,459
My lord.

414
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:56,136
Find me proof that Desdemona is impure.

415
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,659
Don't run away, It's no use.

416
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,013
I want conclusive proof,

417
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,412
or the thunderbolt of my fury

418
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,094
will end your miserable life.

419
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,179
Heaven protect me!

420
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,692
I resign from your service.

421
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:33,369
I call the world to witness
the rewards of honesty.

422
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,894
No, stay.

423
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,094
Perhaps you are honest.

424
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,728
I would be better off a swindler.

425
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:54,133
Don't you see?
I think Desdemona true

426
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,609
and think she is not.

427
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,015
I think you are honest

428
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,494
and think you are not.

429
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,450
I want proof!

430
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,531
I want to know!

431
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:14,410
What proof do you need?

432
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,491
To see them embraced?.

433
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,969
Death and damnation!

434
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,177
That would not be easy.

435
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:35,213
Y et, what certainty can there be,

436
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:45,528
so long as the filthy proof eludes you?

437
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:54,930
But if reason is guide to truth,

438
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:03,091
I offer a conjecture,

439
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:13,613
which can bring you closer to certainty.

440
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,379
Listen.

441
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:27,179
One night,

442
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:31,572
Cassio was sleeping

443
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,130
and I lay nearby.

444
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:41,812
In muttering tones,

445
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:49,295
he betrayed his most secret thoughts.

446
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:59,096
His lips moved slowly

447
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:07,736
in the abandon of his ardent dreams.

448
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:17,734
And then he murmured, faintly, faintly,

449
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:24,777
''Sweet Desdemona,

450
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:30,936
we must hide our love!"'

451
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:42,618
''Divine ecstasy is drowning me!"'

452
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:58,019
The dream became more passionate.

453
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:09,773
Fervently, he seemed
almost to kiss the image of his love.

454
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,411
Then he said,

455
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:24,971
''Curse the cruel fate

456
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:34,293
which gave you to the Moor'!"'

457
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:40,212
- Monstrous crime!
- It was only a dream.

458
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,292
A dream that reflects reality.

459
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:52,214
A dream that can confirm other clues.

460
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,694
What evidence?

461
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:01,094
Have you ever seen in Desdemona's hand

462
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:07,458
a flower-embroidered handkerchief

463
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:13,058
more delicate than gauze?

464
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:25,649
The handkerchief I gave her
as first token of my love.

465
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:29,654
That handkerchief,

466
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,380
I'm sure of it,

467
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:37,179
I saw it yesterday in Cassio's hand.

468
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:46,339
Would but God grant him a thousand lives,

469
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:53,736
for one is not enough to sate my fury.

470
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,619
Jago, my heart is ice.

471
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,613
No more illusions.

472
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,369
I cast away my futile love.

473
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,290
See, it is gone.

474
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,657
The serpent of hate
has trapped me in its coils.

475
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,295
Blood! Blood! Blood!

476
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,970
I swear by the cold heaven,

477
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:34,133
by the forked lightning,

478
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:42,330
by death, and the dark devouring sea!

479
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,732
May this hand I now stretch forth

480
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:52,294
soon be fired,

481
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,658
this hand that I now stretch forth!

482
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,653
Do not rise yet.

483
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:07,210
I swear by the sun

484
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:12,056
which gives life to the earth

485
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:21,731
and the soul of all creation,

486
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:27,293
that my hand, heart and soul

487
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,816
shall be dedicated to Othello's service

488
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:36,532
if he also steels himself

489
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:41,171
to perform the cruel task

490
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:49,578
I swear by the cold heaven,

491
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:55,498
by the forked lightning,

492
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,209
may this hand

493
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:03,658
I now stretch forth.

494
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,693
Eternal God!

495
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:20,578
God of Vengeance!

496
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,499
(distant trumpet fanfare)

497
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,733
(waves crashing on shore gulls cawing)

498
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,618
(men talking)

499
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:15,814
The lookout has sighted the Venetian ship
carrying the envoys to Cyprus.

500
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,572
Very well.

501
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:43,415
May God smile on you, dear husband,

502
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:50,656
master of my soul.

503
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,734
Thank you, my lady.

504
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:06,177
Give me your ivory hand.

505
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:20,049
This hand is moist with soft beauty.

506
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:34,611
It yet has felt no age, nor known sorrow.

507
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:43,175
And yet here nests
the noble demon of bad counsel

508
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:51,850
that the whiteness betrays with its little clutches.

509
01:02:53,740 --> 01:03:06,130
So sweetly it bends to prayer
and to pious abandon.

510
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:14,177
And yet with this hand

511
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:22,179
I gave you my heart.

512
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:50,776
But I must speak to you of Cassio again.

513
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,454
I feel feverish again.

514
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,178
- Bind my forehead.
- Here.

515
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:02,689
- No, with the handkerchief I gave you.
- I don't have it with me.

516
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:13,572
Beware if you've lost it!

517
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:20,418
Beware!

518
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:27,971
A powerful sorceress wove magic

519
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:33,453
in its threads.

520
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:41,096
There is, in its web,

521
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:47,457
a talisman.

522
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:54,856
Beware! To lose it or give it away
would bring disaster.

523
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,851
- Is it true?
- Yes, It's true.

524
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,979
- You frighten me!
- Have you lost it?

525
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,177
- Look for it!
- I'll look for it soon.

526
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,137
No, now!

527
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,497
Oh, God!

528
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:14,889
There is a threat in your voice!

529
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:17,858
- Raise your eyes.
- The idea!

530
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:22,808
Look me in the eye. Tell me who you are.

531
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,414
Othello's faithful wife.

532
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,536
Swear it and damn yourself!

533
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,610
- Don't you believe I am faithful?
- I believe you are impure.

534
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:36,012
- God, help me!
- Run to your damnation.

535
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,535
Say you are pure.

536
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,295
I am pure.

537
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:47,056
Swear it and damn yourself!

538
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:05,010
There's a fury in your words.

539
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,375
I hear it,

540
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:12,455
but cannot understand it.

541
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:20,811
Look at me.

542
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:26,816
I reveal my face and soul to you.

543
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:33,852
Search into my broken heart.

544
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:41,413
I pray to heaven

545
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:47,576
for you with my tears.

546
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:59,811
For you, I weep these hot tears on the ground.

547
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:06,537
See, the very first tears,

548
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:14,015
see, the very first tears

549
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:18,810
that grief ever drew from me.

550
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:28,537
The very first tears.

551
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:34,532
If the devil saw you now,

552
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,610
he'd think you an angel

553
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,340
and not lay a hand on you.

554
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:48,129
God sees my innocence.

555
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,575
No, hell sees it!

556
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:55,293
I implore you to be just!

557
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:59,931
Desdemona, be gone, be gone!

558
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,658
Be gone!

559
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,858
What sin have I committed?

560
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:13,217
Dare you ask?.

561
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:19,694
The blackest of crimes

562
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:25,536
is written on your forehead.

563
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,739
Alas!

564
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:33,213
Are you not a whore?

565
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,736
No, by my faith as a Christian!

566
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:37,969
Eh?.

567
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:44,136
I am not the thing

568
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:48,213
this vile word expresses.

569
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,570
(sobs)

570
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:19,409
Then give me your white hand.

571
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:23,414
I ask your pardon.

572
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:30,328
I took you,

573
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:38,418
forgive me if I am wrong,

574
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:46,497
for that cunning whore,

575
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:57,057
who married Othello!

576
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,737
God,

577
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:49,851
you could have afflicted me

578
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,892
with poverty,

579
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,216
or with shame.

580
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:17,648
Make of my triumphal trophies

581
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,610
a heap of rubble,

582
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,972
a meaningless shame.

583
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:45,050
I would have borne the cruel cross

584
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:50,817
of anguish and shame

585
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:56,008
with patience and fortitude,

586
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:08,613
resigned

587
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:14,969
to the will

588
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:20,737
of God.

589
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:42,653
Oh, grief! Oh, suffering!

590
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:50,818
I've been robbed of the illusion

591
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:55,337
which kept

592
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:04,898
my soul in joyful peace.

593
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:13,219
Cold is the sun,

594
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,769
the smile,

595
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:20,570
the radiance which gave me

596
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:26,337
Life and gladness.

597
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:31,858
Cold is the sun, the smile,

598
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:42,817
the radiance which gave me life,

599
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:51,012
which gave me gladness.

600
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:01,859
But now, gentle God of mercy,
holy immortal spirit,

601
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,580
cover your face

602
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:08,858
with the horrible mask of hell.

603
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,376
Oh, damnation!

604
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:17,215
She must first confess, then die!

605
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:19,211
Confession! Proof!

606
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,496
Cassio is here!

607
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:30,572
Oh, joy!

608
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:36,136
Oh, foul torture!

609
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,375
Calm down and hide.

610
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:21,329
Come in, no one is in here.

611
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:31,696
Step inside, Captain.

612
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:37,651
The word sounds hollow to me.

613
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:42,530
Your cause is in Such good hands.

614
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:47,330
Your Victory is certain.

615
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:53,655
- I hoped to see Desdemona here.
- He spoke her name!

616
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,937
I wanted to speak to her again

617
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:01,218
to know if I am forgiven.

618
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,496
Wait for her.

619
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:15,338
And to pass the time,

620
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:21,491
tell me about the one who is in love with you.

621
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,857
- Who's that?
- Bianca.

622
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,011
He smiles!

623
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,693
Nonsense!

624
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,575
She's determined to ensnare you.

625
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,891
- You make me laugh.
- He who wins, laughs.

626
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:46,692
Where women are concerned,

627
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,612
he who laughs, wins.

628
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,735
(Jago) Ha ha!

629
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:54,212
The wretch's gloating is killing me.

630
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:59,613
God, curb the torment in my heart.

631
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,774
I've already tired of her and her kisses.

632
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,851
Now you make me laugh.

633
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,936
(swords clashing)

634
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:27,536
You long for another beauty.

635
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,016
Do I hit the mark?. Ha, ha!

636
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:34,856
The villain mocks me.

637
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:39,650
Heaven, give me patience!

638
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:43,176
Yes, you've guessed.

639
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,859
- Listen to me.
- Keep your voice down. I'm listening.

640
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,370
You know, Jago, where I live.

641
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,776
Now he is telling how, where, and when.

642
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:05,179
I don't know who le it...

643
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:13,612
I can't hear his words. Yet, I wish I could.
Am I reduced to this?

644
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:18,012
An embroidered handkerchief.

645
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:20,216
Look!

646
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,175
A fine piece of work!

647
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:28,257
Othello is eavesdropping.

648
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:35,859
Handsome sir, in your abode,

649
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:40,252
even the angels would lose
their haloes and their veils.

650
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:45,056
That's the one! That's the one.

651
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:54,413
It's all over: both love and pain.

652
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,572
No one can stir my soul any more.

653
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,850
(trumpet fanfare)

654
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,250
(cheering and shouting)

655
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:22,136
(crowd sings anthem)

656
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:32,059
Long live the Lion of St Mark!

657
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:56,618
The Doge and the Senate,

658
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:05,051
greet the triumphant hero of Cyprus.

659
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:08,292
(fanfare)

660
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:15,499
I consign into your hands

661
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:20,529
the Doge's message.

662
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,214
I kiss the symbol...

663
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:30,218
..of his sovereignty.

664
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:03,454
(cheering and applause)

665
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:16,215
I don't see Cassio amongst you.

666
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:21,215
Othello is angry with him.

667
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:26,534
I am certain he will soon return to favour.

668
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,412
Are you certain of that?

669
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,332
What are you saying?

670
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:36,770
He's reading. He is not talking to you.

671
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:42,094
Maybe he will return to grace.

672
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,933
I hope so.

673
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:58,536
You know how much affection I have
for Cassio.

674
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,975
Be quiet, devil!

675
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,210
Excuse me, my lord.

676
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:06,213
Be quiet, you demon!

677
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:12,892
What my eyes see

678
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,494
cannot be the truth.

679
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:18,220
Call Cassio.

680
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:20,769
Watch her when he arrives.

681
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,813
Is this the hero?.

682
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:31,373
Is this the warrior with the sublime feats?.

683
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,531
He is what he is.

684
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,055
Explain your thoughts.

685
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,611
I better hold my tongue.

686
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:49,253
Here he is. Search into his soul.

687
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:05,933
Gentlemen, the Doge...

688
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,658
How well you weep.

689
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:11,813
..summons me to Venice.

690
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:17,771
And as my successor in Cyprus,

691
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:21,137
he appoints Cassio.

692
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:24,773
- Cassio.
- Hell and damnation!

693
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:32,133
The Doge's word is our law.

694
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,416
(Othello) I shall obey.

695
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:39,377
The crew and the troops...

696
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,451
Still weeping?

697
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:44,373
..the ships and the castle,

698
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:49,091
I leave in the new leader's hands.

699
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:56,139
We sail tomorrow.

700
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:06,097
On your knees...

701
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:11,857
..and weep!

702
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:21,609
(crowd murmurs)

703
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:45,213
On my knees, yes,

704
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:48,292
in the livid mud,

705
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:55,818
stricken I lie.

706
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:01,458
I weep.

707
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:07,968
The shuddering of my dying spirit

708
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:13,658
chills me to the bone.

709
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:31,610
Once on my lips blossomed smiles and kisses.

710
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:39,539
Now, there's only sorrow on my face

711
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,009
and pain in my heart.

712
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:46,609
The sun,

713
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:51,570
serene and bright,

714
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:59,976
which shines in the sky and on the sea

715
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:09,739
cannot dry the bitter tears,

716
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:22,051
the bitter tears of my grief.

717
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,576
- Be gone!
- (crowd shouts)

718
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:29,810
All of you!

719
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:32,289
He's lost his senses.

720
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:37,250
Anyone who stays is my enemy.

721
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,650
(crowd shouts)

722
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:42,459
My husband!

723
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:46,852
My beloved!

724
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:52,929
I curse you!

725
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:58,576
(shouts of confusion)

726
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:06,891
I cannot flee from myself.

727
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,377
Vile thoughts!

728
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:15,138
I see them embrace!

729
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:19,930
The handkerchief!
The handkerchief! The handkerchief! Aah!

730
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,135
(groans)

731
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:30,654
(moans softly)

732
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:38,609
My poison is working.

733
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,577
(crowd) Long live Othello!

734
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,776
The shouts of Victory...

735
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:45,329
(crowd) Long live Othello!

736
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,377
..are his eulogy.

737
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:50,134
(crowd) Long live Othello!

738
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:59,375
Who can stop me

739
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:04,136
from crushing this face under my heel?

740
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,973
(crowd) Long live Othello!

741
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:14,216
Hail to the Lion of Venice!

742
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:19,295
Behold the Lion!

743
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:28,377
(crowd) Long live Othello!

744
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,815
(guffaws)

745
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:46,013
Emilia, please,

746
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:59,218
put on the bed my white wedding dress.

747
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,979
Listen,

748
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:17,449
if I were to die before you,

749
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:22,015
bury me

750
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:28,528
in that lace.

751
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,292
Dismiss that thought!

752
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:38,174
I am so terribly sad.

753
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:41,136
(wind howling)

754
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:36,571
(creaking)

755
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:39,857
Listen! I hear a wailing.

756
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:43,171
Who's knocking at the door?

757
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:45,251
It's only the wind.

758
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,650
(creaking and banging)

759
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:59,494
Farewell, Emilia.

760
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:04,180
How my eyes burn.

761
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:12,851
It bodes weeping.

762
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:24,219
Good night.

763
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:36,772
Ah, Emilia, farewell!

764
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:42,173
Farewell, Emilia.

765
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:01,691
Hail Mary, full of grace,

766
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:06,695
blessed art thou among women.

767
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:17,490
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb,

768
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:24,174
Jesus,

769
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:29,368
pray for those

770
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:38,096
who kneel before thee in adoration.

771
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:45,931
Pray for the sinner

772
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:51,891
and for the innocent.

773
01:35:53,940 --> 01:36:06,171
Pray for us now.

774
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:12,856
Pray for us always

775
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:18,094
and in the hour

776
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:28,258
of our death.

777
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:36,258
Pray for us.

778
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:41,338
Pray for us.

779
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:47,652
Pray.

780
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:59,655
Ave Maria.

781
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:33,299
In the hour of our death.

782
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:51,415
Ave.

783
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:54,572
Amen.

784
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,456
Othello.

785
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:29,892
Have you said your prayers?

786
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,334
Why?

787
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:38,133
Then hurry. I would not kill your soul.

788
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,177
You talk of killing?

789
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:43,332
Think of your sins.

790
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:48,335
- My only sin is love.
- For that you die!

791
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,730
You kill me because I love you?

792
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:55,894
- You love Cassio.
- No, on my soul!

793
01:41:56,060 --> 01:42:00,178
The handkerchief that I gave you,
you gave to him.

794
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:03,059
- It's not true!
- I saw it in his hand.

795
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:07,418
- I'm innocent. I swear.
- Beware of perjury.

796
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:11,937
Help! I don't love Cassio.

797
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,374
Ask him!

798
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:17,374
He's mute forever.

799
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,730
Heavens!

800
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:24,255
He's dead?.

801
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:27,335
Dead.

802
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:31,175
I'm lost, he was betrayed.

803
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:33,900
You dare weep for him!

804
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,934
Othello, don't kill me!

805
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,409
You defend yourself in vain.

806
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:44,654
Have mercy! Let me live!

807
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:49,735
- Just tonight, another hour, a moment!
- No! No!

808
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:53,256
- While I say a prayer.
- No! It's too late!

809
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,290
(gasps)

810
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,209
(Othello shudders)

811
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:33,090
Still

812
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:40,496
as the grave.

813
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:44,733
- (Emilia) Open the door! Open the door!
- (knocking)

814
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,652
Who's there?

815
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:51,893
(Emilia) Open, my lord. I must speak to you.

816
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:54,536
Open the door!

817
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:57,096
(banging)

818
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:03,531
Emilia, what has happened?

819
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:06,168
A great crime!

820
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:08,729
Cassio has murdered Rodrigo.

821
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:11,175
- Cassio lives?
- He lives!

822
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:14,332
Cassio lives!

823
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:19,858
(Desdemona) Unjustly...

824
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:26,930
Unjustly killed.

825
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:31,738
Who moans here? Horror!

826
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:38,538
I die innocent.

827
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:43,330
Oh, dear God. Who has done this?

828
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:47,175
Nobody.

829
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:49,649
I, myself.

830
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:57,259
Commend me

831
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:05,488
to the Lord.

832
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:13,778
I die innocent.

833
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:17,250
Farewell.

834
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:21,492
She's a liar.

835
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:24,174
- I killed her!
- Murderer!

836
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:28,174
- She was Cassio's lover. Ask Jago!
- Ask Jago?

837
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:31,696
Fool! And you believed him!

838
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:36,771
Help!

839
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:42,173
Othello has killed Desdemona!

840
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,491
(exclaiming)

841
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:12,413
Jago, disprove this vile murderer.

842
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:17,215
Did you think Desdemona unfaithful?

843
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:18,859
Speak!

844
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:21,488
I believed her so.

845
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:27,769
She gave the handkerchief
I had given her to Cassio.

846
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:29,214
Oh, heavens!

847
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:32,531
- Hold your tongue!
- No, I will tell all.

848
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:35,168
- (Jago) Hold your tongue!
- No!

849
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:39,128
Jago took the handkerchief from me by force.

850
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:43,009
And I found it in my room.

851
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:47,219
Before he died, Rodrigo confessed.

852
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:49,371
(cries out)

853
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,570
(roars)

854
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,332
(shouts of confusion)

855
01:46:56,460 --> 01:47:03,457
Has heaven no more thunderbolts?.

856
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:23,136
(shouting)

857
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:47,251
Have no fear.

858
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:53,211
Though you see me armed,

859
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:03,019
this is the end

860
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:10,689
of my path.

861
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:20,296
Farewell, Glory!

862
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:33,609
Othello is no more!

863
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:35,736
(sword clatters)

864
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:05,612
And you,

865
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:09,739
how pale you are

866
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:14,416
and tired and silent

867
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:21,010
and how beautiful.

868
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:27,020
Sweet creature,

869
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:37,897
born under an evil star.

870
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:44,059
Cold,

871
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:51,331
as the chastity of your life.

872
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:57,814
Already risen to heaven.

873
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:09,613
Desdemona.

874
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:16,053
Desdemona...

875
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:24,497
..is dead, is dead.

876
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:34,899
Dead.

877
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:07,217
I have a weapon!

878
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:09,418
(cries of panic)

879
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:39,810
Before I killed you,

880
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:45,452
I kissed you.

881
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:57,734
Now, before I die,

882
01:51:57,900 --> 01:52:05,250
in the shadow where I lie...

883
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:18,457
..a kiss.

884
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:30,257
Another kiss.

885
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:59,416
One last kiss.

886
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:12,856
(sobs)

887
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:27,180
(moans softly)
