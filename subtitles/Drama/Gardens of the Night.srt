1
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,129
The marsh ended

2
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,029
in a broad plain where
the light twinkled.

3
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,399
It was a long time since Mowgli had

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,170
concerned himself with
the doings of men.

5
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,609
I will look, he said, and I will see

6
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,979
how far the man pack has changed.

7
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,349
The door of the hut opened, and a woman

8
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,399
stood peering into the darkness.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,179
Who calls, said the woman,
a quiver in her voice.

10
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,809
Have you forgotten, said Mowgli.

11
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,620
His throat was dry as he spoke.

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,149
Have you ever stayed
in a shelter before?

13
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,579
Just walk-ins.

14
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,679
Never for the night.

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,450
And both your parents are dead, right?

16
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,979
Leslie?

17
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,369
Yes.

18
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,799
And how were you when they died?

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,499
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,819
That must have been very difficult.

21
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,789
How old were you?

22
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,889
I was seven.

23
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,829
It was eight.

24
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,530
Eight.

25
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,569
And did you go and live with a relative,

26
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,939
then, who looked after you?

27
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,329
It... uh, an uncle.

28
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,979
We stayed with an uncle.

29
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,679
We?

30
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,719
Who is we?

31
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,669
You and who else?

32
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,370
My brother.

33
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,159
Trixie, come on, girl.

34
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,059
Come on, Trixie.

35
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,069
Trixie, we gotta go now.

36
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,629
Where are you, girl?

37
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,330
Come on, Trixie.

38
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,269
Where are you?

39
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,139
Hey, sweetheart.

40
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,089
You live around here?

41
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,059
Have you seen my dog?

42
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,049
It's a little white terrier.

43
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,089
It's got black spots around its eyes.

44
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,849
No.

45
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,619
Oh, boy.

46
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,389
Well, we were up here
working, and this big Labrador

47
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,889
came along, and they ran off together.

48
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,729
And I've looked everywhere.

49
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,819
I have a Labrador.

50
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,379
A light brown Labrador?

51
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,239
Mm-hmm.

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,539
Did you see it play with
a little white terrier?

53
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,239
No.

54
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,939
No?

55
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,659
Are you sure?

56
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,019
What's your dog's name?

57
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,859
Elvis.

58
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,559
Elvis?

59
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,849
That's a good name.

60
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,019
My dog's name's Trixie.

61
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,469
Do you think they could be
playing in your backyard?

62
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,329
I don't know.

63
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,409
Is your Mommy home?

64
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,789
She's at work.

65
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,919
Yeah?

66
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,409
Well, I bet they're up there right now

67
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,949
tearing up your Dad's flower bed.

68
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,629
Could we go take a look? Real quick?

69
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,789
Come on.

70
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,650
Come on, honey.

71
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,189
Hello, Elvis.

72
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,179
Hey, Elvis.

73
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,259
Have you seen Trixie?

74
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,929
Trixie?

75
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,119
Come here, Trixie.

76
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
Come here, girl.

77
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,599
Thanks a lot for helping look for her.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,829
I'm gonna check the pound.

79
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,719
She's probably there.

80
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,709
She can be a bad dog
sometimes, you know?

81
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,989
Are you on your way to school?

82
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,689
Mm-hmm.

83
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,589
Oh, great.

84
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,089
Now I'm making you late.

85
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,819
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,969
What school do you go to?

87
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,729
St. Andrews.

88
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,429
St. Andrews?

89
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,579
I went to St. Andrews.

90
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,839
Over on Hoover?

91
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,609
Well, come on, I'll give you a ride.

92
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,719
Come on in.

93
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,469
We'll get there lickety-split.

94
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,919
Come on.

95
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,149
Why didn't you say so?

96
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,799
What'd you say your name was again?

97
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,609
Leslie.

98
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,589
Leslie, I'm Alex.

99
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,379
This is Frank.

100
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,789
Hey.

101
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,829
Oh, St. Andrews.

102
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,879
I'll tell you.

103
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,629
Does Mrs. Williams
still teach music there?

104
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,689
Bright red hair... she's
probably pretty old now.

105
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,099
She used to play the tuba really bad.

106
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,759
Yeah.

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,919
It's your lucky day, Leslie,
because I'm showing you

108
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,459
a shortcut I used to take
when I was late for school.

109
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,589
What'd you say your last name was?

110
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,289
Whitehead.

111
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,919
Whitehead?

112
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,489
Is Mr. Whitehead your Daddy?

113
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,199
Oh, my gosh.

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,929
You're kidding me.

115
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,229
We work for Mr. Whitehead.

116
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,089
He's our boss.

117
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,989
At the Water Company.

118
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,709
Yes, at the Water Company.

119
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,269
You know what, I've worked
there almost as long as he has.

120
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,639
I run errands for him sometimes.

121
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,209
I... I might have got your
birthday present for you.

122
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,089
Did you get a big doll
for your birthday?

123
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,789
No.

124
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,929
Oh.

125
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,159
Well, it's still
something, isn't it, Frank?

126
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,879
Huh?

127
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,949
Well, I'm gonna tell him I gave
his daughter a ride to school,

128
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,779
but I'm not gonna say anything
about making her late.

129
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,169
Here we go.

130
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,259
All right.

131
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,960
Have a good one.

132
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,889
Of course I'm gonna do my homework.

133
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,589
I'm almost done.

134
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,029
I'm on the very last chapter.

135
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,799
Bye.

136
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,500
Bye.

137
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,549
Hey Leslie, quick.

138
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,229
We're gonna give you a lift.

139
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,929
What?

140
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,489
Your Daddy asked us to take you.

141
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,389
There's been a problem
at the Water Company.

142
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,869
I'm going home.

143
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,549
They ain't there, honey.

144
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,229
Where are they?

145
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,349
Get in, and I'll explain.

146
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,139
Come on, Leslie.

147
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,499
Get in the car.

148
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,729
Your Daddy's in some trouble, and he

149
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,259
had to leave Wilmington right away.

150
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,999
Where's my Mom?

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,799
She went with him.

152
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,259
She went straight from work.

153
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,579
Why didn't they take me?

154
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,259
Because they asked us
to because it was urgent.

155
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,329
We're going to take you to them.

156
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,219
So come on, let's go.

157
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,689
Ok, we're going to take you to them.

158
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,390
Don't worry.

159
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,729
Why didn't they wait for me?

160
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,559
I don't understand.

161
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,689
Well, it all happened so quickly.

162
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,079
Your Dad called me at the office.

163
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,499
He said to pick you up.

164
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,069
He's in a little bit
of trouble, but it's

165
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,849
nothing serious, so
don't worry about it.

166
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,769
Just eat your hamburger
and drink your drink,

167
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,199
and we'll get you back
to him in no time.

168
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,679
Come on.

169
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,639
Drink it.

170
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,319
Do you have a phone call to make, Alex?

171
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,099
Oh, that's right.

172
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,619
Anyone sees a pay phone, holler.

173
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,489
Yes, she's with us now,
and everything is fine.

174
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,619
Is... Ok.

175
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,119
Ok, that's not a problem.

176
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,859
We'll hear from you
then, Mr. Whitehead.

177
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,149
Ok, thank you.

178
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,850
Bye, now.

179
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,819
Well, that was your Daddy.

180
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,409
And he said everything is a-OK.

181
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,609
He's gonna call us later.

182
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,609
When am I going home?

183
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,399
Soon.

184
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,780
Now drink up your drink, honey.

185
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,539
It's warm.

186
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,389
I'll tell you what.

187
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,559
You drink all of that one, and I'll

188
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,369
get you an ice cold one next.

189
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,359
Go on.

190
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Drink it up.

191
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,510
Help.

192
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,370
Where are we?

193
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,399
All right, folks.

194
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,650
It's bath time.

195
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,319
Ok, let's get undressed and jump in.

196
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,019
Come on.

197
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,009
It's just a bath.

198
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,510
It's not going to bite.

199
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,990
I'm shy too.

200
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,269
Hey, you gotta rub it harder
if you want to get it clean.

201
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,479
Right?

202
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,880
Nobody likes little
boys with dirty hair.

203
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,669
Did Leslie tell you that
she has a dog named Elvis?

204
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,299
Yeah, he's a yellow Labrador.

205
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,409
Right, honey?

206
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,259
Where's Trixie?

207
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,579
Where's who?

208
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,109
Your dog, Trixie.

209
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,179
Oh.

210
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,729
Trixie, well, Frank went
back there to look for her.

211
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,329
And he looked at all the pounds.

212
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,409
And he couldn't find her.

213
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,179
So I guess she's lost.

214
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,549
Poor Trixie.

215
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,480
She shouldn't have run off like that.

216
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,710
Excuse me.

217
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,159
Hello?

218
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,959
Mr. Whitehead.

219
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,019
It's Alex.

220
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,099
Yeah, she's fine.

221
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,210
So how long?

222
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,199
Are you sure?

223
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,900
Ok.

224
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,349
Ok, but hold on a second.

225
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,339
Let me right in down.

226
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,329
All right.

227
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,299
Ok, I guess I'll hear from you then.

228
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,269
Ok.

229
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,750
They don't want her back yet.

230
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,089
Hey, how's your hair?

231
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,709
You want a wash?

232
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,459
I don't believe you.

233
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,119
I don't believe you.

234
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,199
What have I done wrong?

235
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,179
Nothing.

236
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,649
I want to call them.

237
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,609
I want to speak to them.

238
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,169
They wouldn't leave me.

239
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,869
You can.

240
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,569
You can.

241
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,349
I have your Dad's cell phone number.

242
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,050
You can.

243
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,649
Hey, it's ok, honey.

244
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,329
We're here.

245
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,269
And we'll take care of you.

246
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,889
Me and Frank, and so will Donnie.

247
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,089
Won't you, Donnie?

248
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,299
We're gonna look out for you.

249
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,149
So don't worry.

250
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,009
It's all going to work out.

251
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,789
I want to speak to them.

252
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,939
Well, of course you do.

253
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,309
So why don't you keep
their phone number,

254
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,119
and you can call them
back anytime you want?

255
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,189
Ok?

256
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,819
Now, Frank's gonna be back
in a couple of minutes

257
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,110
with some new clothes for you.

258
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,940
Let's say our prayers.

259
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,369
Lord, bless this food for
which we are about to receive.

260
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,389
We are ever so grateful.

261
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,849
And bless this house
and all of us in it.

262
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,399
And look out for Donnie's Mom.

263
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,419
We hope she gets well soon.

264
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,469
And bless Leslie's parents, and help

265
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,229
them get through this troubling
time so they may return to her.

266
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,930
Amen.

267
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Ok, enjoy.

268
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,429
Ignition.

269
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,909
Lift off.

270
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,389
Lift off.

271
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,359
30 seconds after the hour.

272
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,129
Development flight
instrumentation recorders

273
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,829
are on.

274
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,799
Power clear.

275
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,649
The next event is lander separation.

276
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,649
The heat shields will separate in about

277
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,149
three, two, one, zero seconds.

278
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,210
Did you go to school?

279
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,160
What does this say?

280
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,299
Action Truck. Can't you read?

281
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,000
No.

282
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,829
Hey!

283
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,159
Did I say eat your fucking cookie, huh?

284
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,839
Is that what I said?

285
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,720
No, I didn't tell you to eat it.

286
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,200
Neither of you... you fucking
don't listen, neither of you.

287
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,919
You want me to let you
in on a little secret?

288
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,519
Your Mama and Dada, they
don't want you anymore.

289
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,679
They haven't called.

290
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,929
They haven't written.

291
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,840
So it seems like they're pretty
happy without the both of you.

292
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,089
Sometimes, you know,
things are very strange.

293
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:58,579
But no matter how hard you try,
you can never understand them

294
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,090
for why they've done this to you.

295
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,839
Maybe Frank was right.

296
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,169
For whatever reason,
maybe for your Mommy

297
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,909
and Daddy, life was hard.

298
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,819
Things go wrong for them,
and suddenly you're gone.

299
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:25,999
And who knows why, but their
life gets a little bit easier.

300
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,419
Now, your Daddy, he used to
leave you for a few days,

301
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,309
right?

302
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,669
And your Mom said it was for business.

303
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,559
But he didn't even have time to buy

304
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,469
your birthday presents
for you, remember?

305
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,729
Remember?

306
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,549
I got them for you.

307
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,250
Right?

308
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,749
Well, my Daddy was like that too.

309
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,629
I remember this one time,
he'd been away on a long trip.

310
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,969
And he came home, and that night we

311
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,909
stayed up all night, playing games.

312
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,819
And he read to me.

313
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,259
And I remember thinking, this is
the greatest night of my life.

314
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,479
And then he said, I have to
go buy a pack of cigarettes,

315
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,350
but don't worry, because
I'll be right back.

316
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,019
And he never came back.

317
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,859
And I never saw my Daddy again.

318
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,399
So I know how you feel, honey.

319
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,959
I know that I could never be your Daddy

320
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,479
or be anything like
him or take his place.

321
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,109
But I can be like an uncle.

322
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,910
Uncle Alex.

323
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,240
Get some rest.

324
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,989
Were you crying?

325
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,969
No.

326
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,969
Good.

327
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,039
You can't cry.

328
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,249
Nobody likes little girls who cry.

329
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,909
It makes you look like shit.

330
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,559
So your Alex's little girl now, huh?

331
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,939
Alex's favorite little girl.

332
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,620
And you are my favorite little boy.

333
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,400
Just drive the car.

334
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,019
Puts it up off the glass, and it's

335
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,719
in for two.

336
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,439
Leslie, this is Orlando.

337
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,219
He's a good friend of ours.

338
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,919
He's going to look after
you for a while, ok?

339
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,370
I want you to do whatever he asks.

340
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,509
Ok?

341
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,209
She understands.

342
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,239
Don't worry about it.

343
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,279
She's fine.

344
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,899
All right.

345
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,760
We'll see you in a bit.

346
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,829
All we want to do is have
a little fun, Leslie.

347
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,630
It could be fun for you too.

348
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:53,319
Hey, you ever cleaned your
Daddy's shoes, each one

349
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,130
you get a dollar?

350
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,120
Did you do nothing like that?

351
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,460
Mow the lawn, clean the car?

352
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,379
I guess that's what little
boys do... mow the lawn

353
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,270
and clean the car.

354
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:21,780
You see, if you work at
something, it pays off.

355
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,739
If you work like you're
supposed to... you

356
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,129
know, like you would at school.

357
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,030
Only instead of good
grades, you get money.

358
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,039
You pull in enough money, you ain't

359
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,050
got to live on the streets.

360
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,389
And you don't want to do
that, because the streets

361
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,620
is where the devils live.

362
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,230
The streets, you'll get lost forever.

363
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,969
Hey, baby.

364
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,910
What's the matter?

365
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,210
Are you scared?

366
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,209
You know, what we're gonna do is OK.

367
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,090
It's beautiful.

368
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,449
Is it me?

369
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:39,019
Is it the color of my skin?

370
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,529
That ain't nothing to be frightened of.

371
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,010
It feels just the same as yours.

372
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,240
You want to touch it?

373
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,629
Nothing wrong with that either.

374
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,560
Did you know that?

375
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,779
I bet that's been kept
a secret from you.

376
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,530
I bet you everybody
knows except for you.

377
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,979
Nothing wrong with touching.

378
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,970
Everybody does it.

379
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,759
Teacher does it.

380
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,939
Doctors do it.

381
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,659
The police officers do it.

382
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,129
Everybody does it.

383
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,869
Even your Daddy does it.

384
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,459
Your Daddy touches people.

385
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,829
And if you had stayed home, pretty soon,

386
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,949
he'd have been touching you.

387
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,769
No.

388
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,609
What?

389
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,309
No.

390
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,359
Hey, get over here.

391
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,089
Stop!

392
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,679
Stop!

393
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,399
Sit down there!

394
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,809
Shut up!

395
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,399
Do you hear me talking to you?

396
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,789
I'm trying to be nice to you, bitch.

397
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,429
What the fuck are you doing to her?

398
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,909
Just stay out of it.

399
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,169
It's OK.

400
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:09,870
It's ok, baby.

401
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,519
Alex, what the fuck happened?

402
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,219
Get in.

403
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,669
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

404
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,239
Go, go, go!

405
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,779
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

406
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,069
Christ, Alex.

407
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,089
For fuck's sake.

408
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,399
Now, didn't I tell you I'd
always be there to protect you?

409
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,569
Huh?

410
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,379
Nothing's ever going to happen
to you, because I won't let it.

411
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,259
Hey, this is murder, man.

412
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,649
This is fucking murder.

413
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,609
We're all involved in
this, all three of us.

414
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,429
It's ok, Frank, because no one saw us.

415
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,719
All we gotta do is stick together

416
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,860
and support each other.

417
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,829
Shit.

418
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,319
Fucking cops.

419
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,799
Fuck.

420
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,789
Just fuck.

421
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,779
Fuck!

422
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,769
Fuck!

423
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,179
You know, Leslie, we all are

424
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,429
a part of something really terrible now.

425
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:07,759
But if we help each other
and we stand by each other,

426
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,939
then everything's going to be OK.

427
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,199
Do you understand?

428
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,729
Because I'm not going to tell anybody,

429
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,439
and you're not going to
tell anybody, are you?

430
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,140
No.

431
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,610
Don't worry.

432
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,869
Why did they leave me here?

433
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,349
I hate them.

434
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,159
I hate them.

435
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,979
Leslie?

436
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,680
Leslie?

437
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,919
Shhh.

438
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,869
It's ok, honey.

439
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,159
No, shhh.

440
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,519
That's the old you, honey.

441
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,499
You're just leaving it behind.
That's all,

442
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,839
honey.

443
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,339
Shhh.

444
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,819
It's just like the caterpillar.

445
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:26,589
He has to shed his skin to
become the beautiful butterfly.

446
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,929
And you don't think that
hurts the caterpillar?

447
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,389
Of course it does, honey.

448
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,809
But it's the only way he can
become a beautiful butterfly.

449
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,919
And that's what you're
becoming... something really,

450
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,279
really beautiful, honey.

451
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,929
Honestly, I think you're beautiful.

452
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:53,109
Honestly, I would never hurt you.

453
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,229
I would never hurt you, honey.

454
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,199
Shhh.

455
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,169
It's ok, honey.

456
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,119
It's okay now.

457
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,579
It's OK. Shhh.

458
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,059
You've got me.

459
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,019
You've got me, honey.

460
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,469
It's all right.

461
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,939
It's all right.

462
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,910
I'm so proud of you.

463
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,769
Something is coming uphill, said...

464
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,629
Mother Wolf, twitching one ear.

465
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,529
Get ready.

466
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,569
The bushes rustled a
little in the thicket,

467
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,589
and Father Wolf dropped,
ready for his leap.

468
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,249
Man, he snapped.

469
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,729
A man's cub.

470
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,899
Look!

471
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,219
Directly in front of
him, holding a low branch

472
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,179
sit a naked brown baby
who could just walk.

473
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,999
As soft and as dimpled
a little Adam as ever

474
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,409
came to a wolf's cave at night.

475
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,579
He looked up into Father
Wolf's face and laughed.

476
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,399
Is that a man's cub, said Mother Wolf?

477
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,109
I've never seen one before.

478
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,819
Bring it here.

479
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,839
How little, how naked, and how
bold, said Mother Wolf softly.

480
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,189
The baby was pushing
his way between the cubs

481
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,609
to get closer to the warm hide.

482
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,629
He is taking his meal with the others.

483
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,239
He looks like a frog, said Father Wolf.

484
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,070
Then that's what we'll call
him... Mowgli, the Frog.

485
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,739
We should make secret
names for each other.

486
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,839
I could be Mowgli,
and you could be Wolf.

487
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,129
And who are they?

488
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,390
They are the monkey people.

489
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,109
And Mowgli's lost in
the jungle, and Wolf

490
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:06,099
has to find me and protect me
from the evil, crazy monkeys.

491
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,470
And this is our jungle, and
nobody can come into it.

492
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,879
I had a birthday party once.

493
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,269
It was at the old woman's.

494
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,329
She made me a cake...
A chocolate cake.

495
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,430
It had five candles on it.

496
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,009
Why'd you run away from home?

497
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,389
My Mom went crazy.

498
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,970
She said she wanted to
stuff dogs in a library.

499
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,639
What about your Dad?

500
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,890
He lives in a van somewhere.

501
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,339
Where's your Mom?

502
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,799
They put her in a hospital.

503
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,490
Is that why she sold you?

504
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,639
Do you have any pictures like that?

505
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,909
Uh... I don't.

506
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,609
It's OK.

507
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,529
I could take some.

508
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,419
Then they go in the book.

509
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,449
The book gets sent all over the country.

510
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,189
I send it by Fed Ex.

511
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,259
If they get picked, they're
gonna be flown to the client,

512
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,409
or sometimes the client flies to you.

513
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,359
If the kids fly, I go with them.

514
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,389
I arrange the ID.

515
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,399
And the split is an even 50-50.

516
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,939
It's profitable and safe.

517
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,639
Safe?

518
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,649
That's good.

519
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,469
It's important.

520
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,539
Yeah.

521
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,240
Yeah.

522
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,419
We give partner discounts,
so if there's any...

523
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,119
Oh, no.

524
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,379
I don't... I don't...
No, I don't...

525
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,079
Hm?

526
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,779
I'm not like that.

527
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,229
No, me neither.

528
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,639
Ok, good.

529
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,769
So... cute kids, by the way.

530
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,469
Yeah.

531
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,169
Yeah.

532
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:11,919
Adorable.

533
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,659
They are.

534
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,359
Really.

535
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,000
Uh, see, I don't want my kids flying.

536
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,669
Ok.

537
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,370
Ok.

538
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,329
Maybe later.

539
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,119
Yeah, maybe.

540
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,820
Yeah.

541
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,729
Ok, so take a bath.

542
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,429
Take the bath first.

543
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,130
They like that.

544
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,339
Remember, that's a free tip.

545
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,089
Everything's going to be fine.

546
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,129
You know where you're going?

547
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,499
You're going to a judge's house.

548
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,369
You know what that is?

549
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,719
That's a good man.

550
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,419
Judges are fair.

551
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,449
They always do the right thing.

552
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,609
So whatever he wants, you do.

553
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,320
If a judge says it's okay, it's OK.

554
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:23,969
Hey, I'm only going to let
you see the good people,

555
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:29,620
the nice people, people
just like your parents.

556
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,090
Ok?

557
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,869
Listen, Mowgli, said Wolf.

558
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,299
I have to tell you all the
laws of the jungle for all

559
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,739
the peoples of the
jungle, except the monkey

560
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,689
people who live in the trees.

561
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,729
They have no laws.

562
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,560
They are outcasts.

563
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,319
They have no speech of their own
but use the stolen words they

564
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,579
overhear when they listen and peer

565
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,200
and wait up above in the branches.

566
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,809
You got dressed again.

567
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:25,610
Um, why don't you, uh,
put this on instead, hm?

568
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,759
Their way is not our way.

569
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,759
They have no leaders.

570
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,149
They have no memories.

571
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,779
They boast and chatter and pretend

572
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,289
they are great people about to
do great things in the jungle.

573
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,289
Who's this?

574
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,079
Oh, a friend of mine, Jimmy,
dropped by to say hello.

575
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,209
He ran off to do an errand for me,

576
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,619
so I said it was fine
to leave his niece here.

577
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,089
Is he coming back soon?

578
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,790
Yes, he is.

579
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,599
What's your name?

580
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,579
Leslie.

581
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,980
Would you like to
come upstairs and play?

582
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,959
Girls, I want you to look after Leslie

583
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,009
till she's picked up, ok?

584
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,509
Daddy and I will come and
kiss you good night later.

585
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,719
Your blood shall run on the floor

586
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,259
with that of the governor's pigeon.

587
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,579
And him.

588
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,299
I can't see right.

589
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,790
Everything's gone all funny.

590
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,890
You tripping over there, Donnie?

591
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,339
Everything seems so slow.

592
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,999
Mm, yeah.

593
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,709
Yeah, that's about right.

594
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,690
Be right back.

595
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,779
Shit!

596
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,479
Shit!

597
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,449
Shit, shit...

598
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,039
What?

599
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,589
Ice cream is gone.

600
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,739
Ice cream, ice cream,
ice cream... always gone.

601
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,420
So what if the ice cream's gone?

602
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,190
That's shit.

603
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,459
Hey, don't bust your britches.

604
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,949
You just don't have a sweet
tooth like I do, that's all.

605
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,669
I just don't let it
get to me like you do.

606
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,370
That's all.

607
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,719
Honey?

608
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,879
Would you like some ice cream?

609
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,639
Yeah?

610
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,599
What about you, Donnie?

611
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,069
You want some ice cream?

612
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,599
Well, then, let's go to the
store and get some ice cream.

613
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,039
Alex.

614
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,199
Who wants a piggyback ride?

615
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,589
You know, they have
300 kinds of ice cream,

616
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,499
one for every night of the year.

617
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,539
How many can you name, Leslie?

618
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,960
Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla...

619
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,469
We got butter pecan.

620
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,169
You like that?

621
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,239
Ooh, butter pecan.

622
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,399
We got vanilla bean.

623
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,659
We got all kinds of
chocolate... dark chocolate,

624
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,189
light chocolate, mint
chocolate, strawberry,

625
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,489
raspberry, blueberry.

626
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,049
We got Neapolitan, which
is all three together.

627
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,039
That's one of my favorites.

628
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:16,940
And then we got Rocky Road,
Crunchy Crunch, Butter Ripple...

629
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,109
It's 7.95.

630
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,509
Seven-nine... keep the change.

631
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,299
There you go.

632
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,879
Thank you.

633
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,159
Let's go!

634
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:45,490
Now, I'll share, but I
got dibs on the Rocky Road.

635
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:58,769
Let's go.

636
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,739
Come on, get up.

637
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,709
Let's go.

638
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,489
Let's go.

639
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,189
Shhh.

640
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,169
Come on.

641
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,149
Shut the fuck up.

642
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,309
Keep your mouth shut.

643
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,009
Alex!

644
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:09,989
Alex!

645
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,330
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

646
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,699
Shit.

647
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,639
What?

648
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,249
Alex, they're at the fucking door.

649
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:26,949
Let's go.

650
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,250
He's got our fucking faces all over.

651
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,699
Get in, get in, get in.

652
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,400
Let's go.

653
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:45,519
Make a left.

654
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,509
Make a left.
Make a left!

655
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:46,930
I can't.

656
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:47,350
I can't.

657
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,179
There's a truck.

658
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,029
Start singing a song.

659
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,729
What?

660
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,349
Well, start singing a
fucking song, please.

661
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:55,389
Uh, The red, red, Robin keeps a...

662
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,909
Bump, bump, bumping along.

663
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:03,119
Red, red robin keeps
bump, bump, bumping along.

664
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,509
The red, red, robin keeps
bump, bump, bumping along.

665
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,889
I fucking told you, Alex.

666
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:11,839
Stop.

667
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,219
Get down, you little shit.

668
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,589
What the fuck were
they doing back there?

669
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:15,539
Where you going?

670
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,419
I gotta get us off the fucking road.

671
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,549
Every fucking thing was in there.

672
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,489
Everything.

673
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,919
They have exactly nothing.

674
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,689
Bullshit!

675
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,439
Those were the same fucking slopes

676
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,279
from the ice cream store.

677
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,479
I mean, what the fuck
were they doing there?

678
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,089
Well, how should I know?

679
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,399
It was you.

680
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,389
It was you, you fucking...

681
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,089
Hey!

682
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:32,380
Hey!

683
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:33,079
Fucking... fuck you!

684
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,999
Don't blame Leslie!

685
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,179
- Why?
- Because think about it.

686
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,579
She's the one who
fucking said something.

687
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,379
Think about it.

688
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,599
It's not her fault.

689
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,549
Leslie would never say
anything, would you, honey?

690
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,569
Because we have our little
secret, don't we, honey?

691
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,189
We have our secret.

692
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,569
Frank, outside.

693
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,269
Outside.

694
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,970
Shit.

695
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,889
Just stay the fuck away from me.

696
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:01,759
Calm down, son.

697
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,919
Don't you touch me, Alex.

698
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,619
Calm down.

699
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,649
Don't you touch me.

700
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,389
I'm gonna take care of it, ok?

701
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,149
What are you gonna do?

702
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,969
I'll figure out something.

703
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:10,980
Now, just calm down.

704
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,089
You gotta give me more that 20.

705
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:39,879
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,579
I get it.

707
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,569
I get it.

708
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:42,789
I appreciate it.

709
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,369
I've got everything I have, ok?

710
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,089
Well, you got all the good stuff.

711
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,350
I've given you every
single thing I have.

712
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,949
You all nervous here today.

713
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:56,879
Well.

714
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,289
Let me see what you got.

715
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,349
This is all the good stuff?

716
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,619
Yeah, everything.

717
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,589
You got a little of this?

718
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,309
Well, you know what, you got a bonus.

719
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,009
All right?

720
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:05,799
Oh, shit.

721
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,040
Now, give me the money.

722
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,399
Ok.

723
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,099
Right.

724
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,429
You ever hit that
place right over there?

725
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,319
Yeah.

726
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,780
That place with
the big Coca-Cola sign?

727
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,809
The next thing...

728
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:29,789
Mowgli remembered was feeling
hands on his arms and legs

729
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:33,369
and then a swatch of
branches in his face.

730
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:37,299
And then he was staring down
through the strange tree limbs

731
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,939
as the monkey people howled with triumph

732
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,890
and scuffled him away
to the other branches.

733
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,589
Then they began their long flight.

734
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,889
And a flight of the monkey
people through tree land

735
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,030
is one of the things
nobody can describe.

736
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,829
Let's make a promise, Donnie.

737
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,829
What promise.

738
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:14,679
We'll always be together.

739
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,389
Always.

740
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,029
And if something
happens and we can't be,

741
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,199
we'll meet up someplace.

742
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,959
Ok.

743
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,660
Where?

744
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,759
And for the big kid in all of us,

745
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,169
twirl upside down then back
again in the thrilling zipper.

746
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,369
There.

747
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:36,719
We'll meet up there at Wonderland, ok?

748
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,420
Ok.

749
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,219
Remember, the family

750
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,469
that plays together stays together.

751
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:47,419
Located in the heart of Miami Beach.

752
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:51,400
Wonderland USA is bringing
back wonder to the USA.

753
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,310
Get up.

754
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,780
We slept late.

755
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,419
Hey, you want to party?

756
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,209
What you looking for?

757
00:52:59,210 --> 00:52:59,909
Yeah?

758
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,400
How much you looking to spend?

759
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,889
Ok, let's go.

760
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:06,679
Got a place.

761
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,379
Mm-hmm.

762
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,649
Hey, excuse me, sir, but
that's my sister right there.

763
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,169
Donnie, what the hell are you doing?

764
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,819
Now, I don't know what
she's been saying to you,

765
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,989
but she's a bit of a romantic.

766
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,519
You know, flowers,
margaritas, soft music.

767
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,219
You know...

768
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,079
Donnie, get the fuck out of here.

769
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,099
This '80s shit you've got going on,

770
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,099
man, it just ain't the ticket.

771
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,489
She don't like that stuff.

772
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,459
So maybe you, uh... maybe you
should try something else.

773
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,449
Come on, let's go.

774
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,949
Hey!

775
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,939
Go home to your wife, pervert.

776
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,430
Give me back my fucking phone!

777
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,489
Hey, what does that say?

778
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:56,190
Armaments.

779
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,840
What does that mean?

780
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,209
Guns.

781
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:05,509
You know, guns, bombs, stuff like that.

782
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:06,699
Guns?

783
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,009
Why didn't they just say that, then?

784
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,299
Guns.

785
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:09,999
Guns.

786
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,669
I mean, I bet you a bunch
of... a bunch of people

787
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:16,249
are gonna get fucking
caught up on that shit.

788
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,159
Arm... armaments.

789
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:17,860
Armaments.

790
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,840
Ar... ar... armaments.

791
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,529
We cannot enter into
this war unprepared.

792
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,829
It is vital that we
know both the strength

793
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:38,589
and size of their armaments.

794
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,589
Guns.

795
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:44,300
But brother, any such action...

796
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:01,759
Oh, what's up, dude!

797
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,260
Hey, man, what are
you... you're crazy, dude.

798
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,239
Yeah, it's fucking nuts, man.

799
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,339
I'm okay now.

800
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,079
You know, I've been having
this fucking hospital,

801
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,019
right, laying in bed, tubes
out of my arms and shit.

802
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:21,999
It's fucking crazy.

803
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,969
And there was this other guy.

804
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,489
He was all shrunk up.

805
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,890
He was covered...

806
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,599
Excuse me, sir.

807
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,439
Hey, can I interest you in a bar?

808
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,339
We got cheap drinks.

809
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,269
We got straight business.

810
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,209
We got the best live sex acts in town.

811
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,689
Lesbians... we got
fucking everything.

812
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,409
You know what the best part is?
You don't have to pay.

813
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:42,839
You can just sit there,
and you can watch.

814
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,679
I mean, come on.

815
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,579
Think about it.

816
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,669
We got young girls.

817
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:46,579
We got little chickens.

818
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,499
Come on.

819
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,490
Can you spare some change?

820
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:54,429
All right.

821
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:55,129
All right.

822
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,109
Man, look, how much do
you want for that phone?

823
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:57,989
I don't even know.

824
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:00,289
Like, 100, 120.

825
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,159
In your dreams, boy.

826
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,799
You fucking serious?

827
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,499
Come on, man.

828
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,370
That's a nice phone.

829
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:09,280
Hey, mister.

830
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,760
I'll catch you at the boardwalk.

831
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:33,800
I know it scares you, fool.

832
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,779
You're afraid that that girl's going

833
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,000
to get in one of those cars,
and she's not gonna come back.

834
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,399
Yeah.

835
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,109
Is that good, baby?

836
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,499
Oh, yeah.

837
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,459
Oh, yeah.

838
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,419
It feels good.

839
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,329
Do you want it like this?

840
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,850
Everything all right?

841
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:09,159
It's fine.

842
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,190
I'm almost done.

843
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,019
Hey.

844
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,439
Hey, Leslie.

845
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,629
Holy fucking shit, girl.

846
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:59,229
Come here.

847
00:57:59,230 --> 00:57:59,929
Hey, Angel.

848
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:01,229
I'll talk to you afterwards, all right?

849
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,769
Stay close.

850
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:03,469
What's up?

851
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:04,339
How's it going?

852
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,109
Good, Cooper.

853
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:05,809
It's going okay.

854
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:07,649
Hey, I got that date for
you on Night Airline Highway,

855
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,029
if you still want it.

856
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,699
Yeah, right.

857
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,859
Hey, are you still with that kid?

858
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,349
Yeah.

859
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,399
Why the fuck do you
hang out with him, huh?

860
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,059
Does he got the guide map to your life?

861
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,209
I don't think so.

862
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,829
Yeah, but you do.

863
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:24,529
Listen, baby.

864
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:26,490
Friends are just people who
haven't fucked you over yet.

865
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,629
Look, you sure you're OK?

866
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:34,219
You don't look so good.

867
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:34,920
I'm fine.

868
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,299
Here.

869
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,369
Take this.

870
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:43,109
A gift.

871
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:43,810
Thanks.

872
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,019
Look at those fucking niggers, man.

873
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,979
Remember Donna?

874
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,679
Yeah?

875
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,589
She's hanging out right over there.

876
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,229
She was a lot like you too.

877
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,929
She wanted to be independent.

878
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,289
You know?

879
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:06,449
Anyway, one day there was
this gang of nigger pimps

880
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:09,219
from Oceanside driving by.

881
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,349
Saw her.

882
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,449
They liked her, so they
fucking grabbed her right off

883
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,129
the fucking street, man.

884
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,399
You ever think why they like
working the white girls?

885
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,759
It gets them the white money.

886
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,200
It's a real fuck you.

887
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,149
Hey Leslie, I want to
show you something.

888
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,020
Come with me?

889
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,130
You know that shelter on India Street?

890
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,650
How would you feel about going
there and bringing her out?

891
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,149
Too you?

892
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,789
Yeah.

893
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,669
But first I want you to turn her.

894
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,189
And then you bring her.

895
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,289
I'm not a fucking booster.

896
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,189
I know that, but it doesn't
take any special skills, right?

897
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,549
I mean, you tell her
how I'm gonna help her,

898
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,229
and then you break her in.

899
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,329
Let her watch you do
it a couple of times.

900
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:40,039
You know how it goes.

901
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,779
Hey, I'm offering you
something pretty great here.

902
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,149
I know you.

903
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:48,559
I know that when you close your
eyes, you see something better.

904
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,129
I can set you up with
some people I know.

905
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:53,749
You won't have to scrounge
around for a tiny bit of money

906
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,689
anymore.

907
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:56,959
Ok?

908
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,950
Think about it.

909
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:38,249
- Hey.
- Hey.

910
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,119
What's up?

911
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,879
Hey, I got you this.

912
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,789
Oh, my God.

913
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:42,489
Hey.

914
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,189
Thank you.

915
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,940
No problem.

916
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,099
So what did Cooper want?

917
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:51,989
Nothing.

918
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,589
So he just gave you this?

919
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,659
He likes me.

920
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,909
Yeah, well, he's an asshole.

921
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:58,609
How's that?

922
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,309
He's OK.

923
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,529
He just gets uptight sometimes.

924
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,749
Hey, guys.

925
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,409
How you doing?

926
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,129
I got something for you.

927
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:08,229
I'll take them if I can use them, ok?

928
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:09,730
We're here every night.

929
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,709
Kinda hot for one of those ladies, huh?

930
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,709
Select music.

931
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,189
This is a great song!

932
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,689
Ready?

933
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,529
Hey, I'm gonna stay up.

934
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:51,020
So if you want to sleep,
you know, it's cool.

935
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:41,759
You want me, don't you?

936
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,079
You want me now so bad,
you don't know what to do?

937
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,659
Well, feel this.

938
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,669
It's so wet.

939
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,119
Oh.

940
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,259
I can feel it.

941
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,029
Oh, I can feel it.

942
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,899
It's so big, rubbing up and down.

943
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,079
It's so big.

944
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,339
It's almost too big.

945
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,199
Oh, come on, baby.

946
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,339
Fuck me.

947
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,429
Come on.

948
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,149
Fuck me.

949
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:07,049
Come on, spit it into me.

950
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:07,949
Come on, spit.

951
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:08,649
Spit.

952
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:09,349
Come on.

953
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,319
Let it explode.

954
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,019
Oh my God.

955
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:14,579
Let it explode so hard, it's
gonna shoot out my throat.

956
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,399
Oh my God.

957
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,099
I'm gonna come.

958
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,079
I'm gonna come.

959
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,059
I'm gonna come.

960
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,250
And then they do.

961
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,089
32 seconds.

962
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,159
Shoot out my throat?

963
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,699
I gotta use that.

964
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,959
You really have to say all that?

965
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,559
I remember this one time,
I had this Chinese guy,

966
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,839
and he had a small one.

967
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,209
You know, very small.

968
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:44,439
We're talking teensy-weensy here, ok?

969
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,189
And he goes, oh, oh,
you like my big dick?

970
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:51,429
Big dick?

971
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,089
He paid me, like, an extra
100 just to keep saying that.

972
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,509
I did like his big dick.

973
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:57,479
Why are guys so into
the size of their dicks?

974
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,049
Well, because we are.

975
01:05:59,050 --> 01:05:59,839
No, they're not.

976
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,909
Not all of them anyway.

977
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:03,039
All they want to hear
about is how big it is

978
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,269
and how smooth it is and
how good it feels going in.

979
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:06,219
No, they don't.

980
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,529
I do the same stuff you guys
do, and I don't say that shit

981
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:09,999
to them, and they don't
say that shit to me.

982
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,969
Well, maybe you're not, like,
a great conversationalist,

983
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,339
Donnie.

984
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,299
What the fuck is that?

985
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,349
Just some big-ass word?

986
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:18,189
It just means that
you're not into talking.

987
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,679
No, we talk.

988
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,649
We just don't talk that stuff.

989
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:22,649
Well, what do you talk about?

990
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:23,489
Fuck you.

991
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:26,899
Football, man.

992
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,409
Football and politics.

993
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:29,759
That's what we talk about.

994
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,119
Leave all that dirty
shit up to you girls.

995
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:32,820
Ahh!

996
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,529
I got it.

997
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:50,989
You know, Rat Boy's thinking about going

998
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:53,059
over to Fort Lauderdale.

999
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:58,739
You know, maybe we... maybe
we should go along with him.

1000
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,559
Why?

1001
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:04,329
Well, there's that carny
that starts up in March.

1002
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:07,269
And it travels up and down all year.

1003
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,299
Maybe we could... maybe we
could get a job working

1004
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,339
the rides or the hot
dog stand or the popcorn

1005
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,039
or something like that.

1006
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,369
I, uh... I met some
friends up there last time.

1007
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:19,289
And they seemed like
they really liked it.

1008
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:22,209
You know.

1009
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:22,939
I don't know.

1010
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,419
I thought it'd be kinda cool.

1011
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,979
I'm tired of moving.

1012
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,859
Well, do you want to just settle down,

1013
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:36,119
get a house and a pool and
a dog and the whole thing?

1014
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,739
A dog would be OK.

1015
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:38,689
Yeah.

1016
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,499
A dog would be nice.

1017
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,759
Did you sell that phone yet?

1018
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,459
No.

1019
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,199
Rat Boy's got it.

1020
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,789
Donnie, how long does it
take to sell a fucking phone?

1021
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:50,999
I told you, Rat Boy's
gonna take care of it.

1022
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,779
I mean, I'm just waiting on him.

1023
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,529
You don't care, do you, if we sleep out

1024
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,710
on the beach and the park, do you?

1025
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:14,889
Thanks.

1026
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,590
Thank you.

1027
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:38,450
Do you ever think about Alex
and Frank and that whole thing?

1028
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:42,989
No.

1029
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:43,690
Never?

1030
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:47,760
I don't think about it.

1031
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,170
I do.

1032
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:05,079
Like, I mean, I know that
sounds weird, but you know,

1033
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,660
without them, we would
have never met, you know?

1034
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,399
You don't have to do anything to me,

1035
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,850
and I'm not gonna do anything to you.

1036
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:50,560
Anybody can have that part.

1037
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,619
How old are you, Leslie?

1038
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,320
18.

1039
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:45,490
I'm nearly 17.

1040
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:54,160
And both your parents are dead?

1041
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,559
Yes.

1042
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,259
I'm sorry.

1043
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,489
That must be very hard for you.

1044
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:05,639
How old were you when they died?

1045
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,339
Seven.

1046
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:07,040
Eight.

1047
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,469
And did you go to live with relatives?

1048
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:13,959
Who looked after you?

1049
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,659
An uncle.

1050
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,819
We stayed with an uncle.

1051
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:17,519
We?

1052
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,509
Who is we?

1053
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:20,500
My brother.

1054
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,529
And where is the uncle now?

1055
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:31,129
I don't know.

1056
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:32,040
And your brother now?

1057
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,990
I don't know.

1058
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,749
Have you ever stayed in a shelter?

1059
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:41,679
Just walk-ins.

1060
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,709
Never for the night.

1061
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:44,409
All right, Leslie.

1062
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:45,289
Well, here it is.

1063
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,699
No drugs or alcohol in this building

1064
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,409
or in the recreational yard.

1065
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:53,119
If you're caught with them in
your possession, you're out.

1066
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,899
And no amount of tears
or pleading or excuses

1067
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,739
will change that.

1068
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:03,019
If you have to smoke, you do it
outside, not in this building.

1069
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,749
Ok?

1070
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,159
You're free to come
and go during the day.

1071
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,439
But those doors are looked
at 9 o'clock at night,

1072
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,379
and they are not reopened
till 8.00 in the morning.

1073
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,549
The shelter is here to help you.

1074
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,729
It's here to help you stop taking drugs,

1075
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:21,309
to help you stop prostituting yourself,

1076
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:23,719
and to help you stop killing yourself.

1077
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,640
You understand that?

1078
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,029
You came in here to get
away from something.

1079
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:34,190
But you leave that something
outside, all right?

1080
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,799
Understand?

1081
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,779
Yes.

1082
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:43,319
Don't bring it in here.

1083
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,589
Ok.

1084
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:45,290
Good.

1085
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:19,429
Hey.

1086
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:20,130
Hey.

1087
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:28,859
They were gonna send
me to a foster home.

1088
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:31,249
Soda home.

1089
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,409
Everything's got another name.

1090
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:38,899
Sweet Mac, player, gorilla, meat dealer.

1091
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,169
Just another name for somebody
who wants to make money off

1092
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:42,229
of you.

1093
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:46,259
A strawberry is somebody who lets them.

1094
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:50,179
What you got to do is make your
own family, somebody who'll

1095
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:52,140
keep an eye open when
you want to close yours.

1096
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,749
These places are no better,
selling dope in the kitchen.

1097
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:01,689
They let the johns in at night,
keep the money for themselves.

1098
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:03,520
You may as well keep
the money for yourself.

1099
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:13,489
The whole world's doing it,
and you might as well know it.

1100
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:15,999
How old are you?

1101
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,700
12.

1102
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:29,569
What's up, man?

1103
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:30,560
You wanna party?

1104
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,189
How you doing?

1105
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:01,099
Not bad, man.

1106
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,379
You know.

1107
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,889
Nice sea breeze, pleasant night.

1108
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:06,119
How much?

1109
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,859
My man, you couldn't afford me.

1110
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,209
I'm just too expensive for you.

1111
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:11,889
All right.

1112
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:14,719
Fuck you, punk.

1113
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,129
Hey, wait, man.

1114
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,089
Man, fuck you.

1115
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:19,029
You can't take a fucking joke?

1116
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,569
Laugh about it, motherfucker.

1117
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:22,270
Fuck you.

1118
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:18,879
So, this is Cooper, who
I was telling you about.

1119
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,149
You're a beautiful girl.

1120
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,549
You know that, right?

1121
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:23,479
Yeah.

1122
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,449
Lady's gonna take care of you, ok?

1123
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:29,209
I've been waiting for you
for a long time, you know.

1124
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:31,199
Did you know that?

1125
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,939
Leslie wouldn't care unless you no good,
but we're gonna work something out,

1126
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:35,690
all right?

1127
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:46,139
My parents got this place
in the country.

1128
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,630
They're away, and I think we should go.

1129
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:08,669
You sure that this is
the right thing to do?

1130
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:09,610
Yeah, why?

1131
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:16,709
I just feel scared.

1132
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:19,699
Hey, it's gonna be OK.

1133
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:23,049
You know what this is like?

1134
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:26,429
It's like when a caterpillar
becomes a butterfly.

1135
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:29,919
You think that doesn't hurt?

1136
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,390
But it's the only way
to become a butterfly.

1137
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:36,709
And that's you.

1138
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,040
You're gonna become something beautiful.

1139
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,999
Hey, don't worry.

1140
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,490
I'm gonna look out for you, ok?

1141
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,689
Hey, man.

1142
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:50,079
Where's Leslie?

1143
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,109
- What?
- Where the fuck is she?

1144
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,179
You know what I'm talking about.

1145
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:52,879
Where's Leslie?

1146
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,189
Man, get the fuck away from me.

1147
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:54,889
Fuck you.

1148
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:55,589
Listen, asshole.

1149
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,549
Man, I didn't do anything
with her, all right?

1150
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:59,539
She went.

1151
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:00,510
And she wanted to go.

1152
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:03,529
What?

1153
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:04,069
Fuck you.

1154
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:04,400
What?

1155
01:20:04,401 --> 01:20:05,469
You're fucking lying, man.

1156
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:07,039
What, you thought she
was going to hang around

1157
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,479
with you the rest of her fucking life?

1158
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,819
You're a fucking liar.

1159
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:12,059
Her own fucking words, man.

1160
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,749
She had a chance to move up, and
you're a fucking dead weight.

1161
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,650
You're a fuck up.

1162
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,019
Fuck you.

1163
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:24,760
Fuck you.

1164
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,699
Come on, Cooper.

1165
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,400
Let's go.

1166
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:36,390
What?

1167
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,249
I'm your host, Rod Baker.

1168
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,749
Now, on today's show, let's welcome back

1169
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,699
our champion, Bunny.

1170
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,689
Oh, hi!

1171
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:50,689
Hello, Bunny.

1172
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:52,179
Come on in.

1173
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,679
Hiya, Rod.

1174
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,169
And how are you today?

1175
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:57,409
Oh, I'm fine.

1176
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:58,159
I'm fine.

1177
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,149
Feeling lucky?

1178
01:21:59,150 --> 01:21:59,949
Oh, yeah!

1179
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:02,139
Oh, that's great, Bunny.

1180
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:05,629
As you know, Bunny
has won $17.380!

1181
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:10,109
Oh, thank you!

1182
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:11,479
Bunny, are you ready to meet

1183
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,299
that new challenger?

1184
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,099
Oh, yeah.

1185
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,089
I really am.

1186
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:15,089
Ok.

1187
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:16,629
Oh, yeah.

1188
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,469
I can feel it.

1189
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:20,819
It's so big.

1190
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:23,759
It's so big, rubbing up and down.

1191
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,739
That's my little girl.

1192
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,489
Baby, fuck me.

1193
01:22:26,490 --> 01:22:27,189
Come on.

1194
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,149
Talk to me, little girl.

1195
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:30,879
Come on, spit it into me.

1196
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,679
Come on.

1197
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,379
Spit it.

1198
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,509
- Come on.
- Tell me, little girl.

1199
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:35,219
Come on, it's gonna
shoot out in my throat.

1200
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:35,919
Oh, baby.

1201
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,619
Yeah.

1202
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,189
Come on.

1203
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,659
I'm gonna come.

1204
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:40,919
I'm gonna come.

1205
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:41,619
Tell me.

1206
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,539
Tell me.

1207
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,529
I'm gonna come.

1208
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:45,359
Tell me, little girl.

1209
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,719
Just come.

1210
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,259
Why can't you come?

1211
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,749
Just come.

1212
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:50,449
Come on.

1213
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:50,730
Come.

1214
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:51,429
Hey.

1215
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:54,369
Come on, just fucking come.
Why can't you come?

1216
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:57,249
Hey, get the fuck off me, then!

1217
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,299
I don't need this shit.

1218
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,319
I don't need this.

1219
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,489
Fucking crazy bitch.

1220
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:08,499
Hey, fuck you, then.

1221
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,779
Fuck you.

1222
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:11,480
Fuck!

1223
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,229
Shhh.

1224
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:24,699
Shhh.

1225
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,659
It's okay.

1226
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,189
That's the old you.

1227
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:30,780
You're just leaving it behind.

1228
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:37,610
You're my girl now,
and that's our secret.

1229
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:35,979
You don't love me.

1230
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:38,009
I'm just something you caught.

1231
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:44,349
You think I'm some kind of animal...

1232
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:45,329
Come on, honey.

1233
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,299
You gotta wake up.

1234
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:47,769
You gotta listen to me.

1235
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:48,739
I lied to you.

1236
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:51,179
These people, they're
not gonna protect you.

1237
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,109
They're gonna make you
do terrible things.

1238
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:56,599
They gonna make you do the
worst things in the world,

1239
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,089
so we've got to get out of here.

1240
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:59,089
Come on.

1241
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:00,080
Come on.

1242
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,449
That fucking bitch is dead.

1243
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:34,439
Oh, fuck.

1244
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,329
Hey, you guys know where
the fucking jump is, right?

1245
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:38,029
Get to that shit right fucking now.

1246
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:38,759
Get there.

1247
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,460
Fuck.

1248
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,619
Hey, Christian, you fucking faggot.

1249
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,699
Where's Leslie?

1250
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,749
Where is that bitch?

1251
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,430
Man, I swear to fucking God,
where is that bitch?

1252
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:25,609
You must be out of your fucking mind.

1253
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:26,649
You remember Surf?

1254
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:28,929
You want to end up
dead in the toilet too?

1255
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:31,129
I just want to get Donnie.

1256
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:32,259
Donnie?

1257
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:33,259
Donnie's long gone, honey.

1258
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:35,759
He left town with Rat Boy.

1259
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,109
He left town?

1260
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:38,629
When did he go?

1261
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:39,329
I don't know.

1262
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:40,699
But they're long gone.

1263
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:43,469
Just get the fuck out
of here yourself, ok?

1264
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:45,039
Wait.

1265
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,609
Did he say where he was going?

1266
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:48,309
Yeah.

1267
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:49,190
To find America.

1268
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:05,439
Leslie, let me ask you, do you
really think both your parents

1269
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:09,719
are dead, your Mom and your Dad?

1270
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,730
Do you really believe that?

1271
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:23,169
Were you still living
at home when they died?

1272
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:23,870
No.

1273
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:30,699
Then how do you know they're dead?

1274
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,629
I heard it.

1275
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,459
You heard it?

1276
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,240
Where did you hear it?

1277
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:40,560
Hm?

1278
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:47,819
All right.

1279
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,679
And where's home to you?

1280
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,919
Leslie, where is that?

1281
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,699
I don't remember.

1282
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:57,630
I think we all remember home.

1283
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,679
You know what I think?

1284
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:13,699
I think you left, maybe
because you wanted to,

1285
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,710
maybe you didn't, maybe you had to.

1286
01:29:21,610 --> 01:29:24,429
And I think you left
so long ago that now

1287
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:28,569
you have no idea how to go back.

1288
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:30,269
It's like you don't know how to tell

1289
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:33,859
your parents that you're not dead.

1290
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:36,619
It's like you can't
even admit to yourself

1291
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:40,269
that your parents aren't dead.

1292
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:42,119
Right?

1293
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,819
Why can't you admit that, Leslie?

1294
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,150
Because they fucking didn't want me.

1295
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:51,709
They left me, and they
never came back to get me.

1296
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:54,329
And I fucking... I heard
them on the phone.

1297
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:55,519
And they kept saying, soon.

1298
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,630
And then they never came.

1299
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:06,350
Well, I would imagine you heard
one side of a conversation.

1300
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,489
You know how many kids I've
had in here over the years who

1301
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:16,759
heard one end of a
telephone conversation... one

1302
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:21,589
side of a call, where the
other side is only a dial tone?

1303
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:23,929
You know how many?

1304
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:24,920
A lot.

1305
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,610
What's wrong?

1306
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:12,769
It looks to me like
they... they want you.

1307
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:18,879
I... I... I couldn't go back.

1308
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,219
They don't want me.
They wouldn't want me now.

1309
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:26,279
I'm...

1310
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,269
And I've done too many things.

1311
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:30,629
They don't want me.

1312
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:33,629
Oh, you could go back.

1313
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:35,119
Of course they would want you.

1314
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,969
No, they wouldn't.

1315
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:39,279
You don't understand.

1316
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,900
They wouldn't want me now.

1317
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:53,830
Leslie, it's time for you to go home.

1318
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:40,830
I can't believe you're actually here.

1319
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:48,099
So Leslie, um, there's
something that you have to know.

1320
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:51,779
We, um... your
mother and I wanted

1321
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:54,769
to be the ones to tell you.

1322
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:58,110
You have a brother and a sister.

1323
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,169
What do you mean?

1324
01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:08,370
Well, after you... we
had two more children.

1325
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:19,179
Where are they?

1326
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:21,239
They're, um...
They're at a friend's.

1327
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:24,609
We wanted to see you first.

1328
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:26,079
Do they know about me?

1329
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,209
Of course.

1330
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:28,150
Of course they do.

1331
01:35:31,630 --> 01:35:33,749
Well, what did you tell them?

1332
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:38,439
We told them that, um,
they had a beautiful older

1333
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:42,270
sister who we love very much.

1334
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:48,040
And who had gone to heaven.

1335
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:54,849
Is that what you thought?

1336
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:56,959
You thought I died?

1337
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:57,659
No.

1338
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,359
No, no.

1339
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,969
No, we never stopped hoping.

1340
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:02,080
Never, never.

1341
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:09,980
Leslie.

1342
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:17,110
I want you to come home.

1343
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:38,619
Hey.

1344
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:40,679
So this is... this is Dylan.

1345
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:43,509
This is Gracie.

1346
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:44,210
This is your sister.

1347
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:49,279
Hi.

1348
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,630
Did you come back from heaven?

1349
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,809
No.

1350
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:58,170
Where did you come back from?

1351
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,779
I was in a forest.

1352
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:08,540
What forest?

1353
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:13,399
It was far away.

1354
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,830
What were you doing there?

1355
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:22,429
I was lost.

1356
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:25,429
Were you scared?

1357
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:26,779
Sometimes.

1358
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:27,480
Why?

1359
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,639
Because there were
monsters in the forest.

1360
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:40,949
Hey, you know, tell you what, why

1361
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:42,729
don't we all go in the dining room.

1362
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:46,179
And then you guys can show
Leslie the really great cake...

1363
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:47,870
Mommy made especially for her, ok?

1364
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:54,660
Hey!

1365
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:59,249
It's yummy.

1366
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,900
And Mama says it's your favorite.

1367
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:25,899
Ow!

1368
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,779
Did you get it in your hand?

1369
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:28,989
Did you catch it?

1370
01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:29,709
Excellent.

1371
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:30,709
It's glittery.

1372
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:31,710
Look at that.

1373
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:42,570
You ever get scared,
doing stuff like this?

1374
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:48,309
You just have to have
somebody to look out for you.

1375
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:49,270
That's all.

1376
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:13,240
And this is our jungle,
and nobody can come into it.

1377
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,119
Come back, she whispered.

1378
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,609
Come back, for I love you.

1379
01:41:41,610 --> 01:41:44,389
Come back again by night or by day.

1380
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:46,829
This door is never shut to you.

1381
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:49,999
Mowgli's throat worked
as though the cords in it

1382
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,929
were being pulled and his voice
seemed to be dragged from it,

1383
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:56,630
as he answered, I will surely come back.

1384
01:41:59,631 --> 01:42:07,408
