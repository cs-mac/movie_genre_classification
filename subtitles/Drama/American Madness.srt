1
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,785
Good morning. Union National Bank.

2
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:04,530
Just a minute.

3
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,746
Come on, Oscar. What are we waiting for?

4
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:17,295
- What's the matter? Can't you find it?
- Sneak up on it, boy.

5
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:20,753
- Oscar, come on.
- Say, if it had lipstick on it, he'd find it.

6
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:23,883
Almonds to you. Almonds.

7
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:25,348
Not almonds.

8
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:32,182
9:00 and all is lousy.

9
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:35,440
I have to spend half my life
waiting for these time clocks to open.

10
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:36,985
Say, where's Matt?

11
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,276
Probably upstairs thinking up
that daily joke.

12
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:41,189
That guy kills me with his wisecracks.

13
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,488
Say, when he comes in,
let's put on frozen faces.

14
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:45,153
Let's smile.

15
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:46,864
Here he comes.

16
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:51,744
How you doing, slaves?

17
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,790
- Hello, Matt.
- How are you, Matt?

18
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:04,132
Did you fellows ever hear the story
of the pawnbroker with the glass eye?

19
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,423
No, Matt. What is the story about
the pawnbroker with his glass eye?

20
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,258
Well, I'll tell you.

21
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,268
A fellow went into this shop
to pawn his watch.

22
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:15,520
The pawnbroker said,
"I'll give you $50 for it

23
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,763
"if you can tell me which is my glass eye."

24
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:20,817
The fellow says, "All right,

25
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,649
"I'll do that.

26
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,774
"It's the right one."

27
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:28,107
The pawnbroker says, "That's correct.

28
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:31,323
"How did you know it was the right one?"

29
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:35,744
The fellow says, "Well, it's got
more sympathy than the other."

30
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,248
Sympathy. You know, the right one
had more sympathy than the other.

31
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,342
What's the matter?
Can't you get this thing open?

32
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:49,843
Six reasons why banks fail.

33
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,304
I love your jokes, Matt. So entertaining.

34
00:02:54,393 --> 00:02:56,267
Let me get to the point of this story.

35
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:58,595
- Very funny man.
- Great audience, you guys.

36
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:17,577
Come on, white collars. The day's started.

37
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,755
You're carrying too much money, Hank.
Better turn some in tonight.

38
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,583
- Okay, Matt.
- How are you fixed?

39
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,217
I'm okay, Matt.

40
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:33,388
- You got enough?
- I'll be all right.

41
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,767
Matt, I'll need some money
for those Manville payrolls.

42
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,933
- How much?
- About $24,000.

43
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:47,189
It was more than that last week.

44
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,776
Well, here's $25,000.

45
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:53,564
Say, do me a favour, will you, Charlie?

46
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:55,199
- Yeah.
- Let me have $10.

47
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:56,482
Ten bucks?

48
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,445
Say, if I had $10, I'd quit.

49
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:10,423
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

50
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,124
I'll pay you back on Saturday.
On the level, I will.

51
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:14,380
Now, give me $10, will you?

52
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,091
I got to get it back in my account.
If Helen finds out...

53
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,265
Baby, I can't give you anything but love.

54
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,342
Listen, Charlie, I'll give you an IOU.

55
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:25,639
I'll give you a note, a mortgage...
It's a matter of life and death.

56
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,059
Whose death?

57
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,438
I'll be yours
if you don't kick in with that $10.

58
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:31,518
Say, pal, did you ever hear of a depression?

59
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:33,271
Nerts!

60
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:35,107
Come over and see us sometime.

61
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:39,326
I'm not asking you to pay off the French
war debt. I'm only asking you for $10.

62
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,983
That mug reminds me
of the guy with his second dollar.

63
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,286
What did he do with his first one?

64
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:46,947
He bought himself a pocketbook.

65
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:55,463
- Hello, Helen.
- Matt, come here.

66
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,294
- What?
- Come here.

67
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:01,754
Hey, look out. Somebody's liable to see us.

68
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:03,093
Is that so?

69
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,488
Look who's here.

70
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:21,857
Hey, Jim.

71
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:29,407
Five ill winds.

72
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,163
And blowing no good
for the old man, either.

73
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:33,493
The four-and-a-half horsemen.

74
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:36,160
What are they doing here?
There's no board meeting today.

75
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:37,536
Search me.

76
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,758
- Mr Dickson in yet?
- Not yet, Mr Clark.

77
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:43,049
Tell him we're waiting for him
in the board room.

78
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:45,379
- And tell him not to delay.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:49,303
Looks like trouble for your boss.

80
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:52,145
Takes more than two tons of directors
to make trouble for my boss.

81
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,344
Says you.

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,729
I've sent for the cashier, gentlemen.

83
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,648
He has a list of the loans
that Dickson made last month.

84
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:02,109
As I told you,
it's time we did something about it.

85
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:05,614
Mr Clark's right. Dickson will ruin this bank
if we don't stop him.

86
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:07,859
Looks to me like we're in hot water already.

87
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:09,613
Gentlemen, I was just wondering...

88
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,662
I think you're panic-stricken about nothing.

89
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:13,575
- Dickson's all right.
- Is he?

90
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:16,752
We carry more unsecured paper
than any other institution in the city.

91
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:19,125
- We're fools to tolerate it.
- That's what I say.

92
00:06:19,214 --> 00:06:21,503
And the only way to end it
is to get Dickson out.

93
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,129
- Don't make me laugh.
- Dickson doesn't have to go,

94
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,840
but he must agree to this merger
with the New York Trust.

95
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,257
What good will that do?

96
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,090
I'll take control away from him.

97
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,137
We'll put someone else in charge,
call in all doubtful loans

98
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,137
and be on safe ground again.

99
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,934
- It just occurred to me...
- You're wasting your time.

100
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,304
Dickson will never stand for it.

101
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,523
He will if I have anything to say about it.

102
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,354
- Come in, Cluett.
- Here's the list.

103
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,644
- Thank you.
- Anything else?

104
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,149
No, nothing.

105
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,409
Look at this. Just look at this.
It's outrageous.

106
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,154
Henry Moore: $36,000.

107
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,869
Manny Goldberg: $8,500.

108
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,279
Tony Consero: $55,000.

109
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,874
Joseph McDonald: $18,000.

110
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,043
Alvin Jones: $66,000
to a hotel that's on its last legs.

111
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,414
People can get loans here
who couldn't borrow 5 cents anywhere else.

112
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,713
And on what? "Hunches," he calls it.

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,041
Someday he'll get a hunch
and give the bank away.

114
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:11,255
He's almost done that already.
Matt Brown is an example of that.

115
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,762
Breaks into Dickson's house, holds him up,
and next day has a job here.

116
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,344
As far as I'm concerned...

117
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,887
A boy who should be in jail,
handling the bank's cash.

118
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,267
What did you do with it?

119
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,808
- With what?
- The $10.

120
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,028
- Ten dollars.
- Yes.

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,569
A friend of mine...
Yeah, really, his mother was terribly sick

122
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,282
- and she was dying, would you believe it?
- No.

123
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,202
- You think I'm lying?
- Yes.

124
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:42,744
All right, I'm lying.
Don't forget you called me a liar.

125
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:46,290
Honey, why don't we get married?
Then you can handle it all.

126
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,338
- Say, Matt, did you hear the news?
- No.

127
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:49,587
Well, pardon me.

128
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:53,174
All the big shots are in a huddle.
It looks like Dickson's out on his ear.

129
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:54,721
- You're kidding.
- I'm not kidding.

130
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:57,213
- Everyone knows. Ask her.
- I haven't heard about it.

131
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:58,635
Everybody's talking about it.

132
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:01,513
If that's on the level,
there goes my assistant cashier's job.

133
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:04,937
I just thought I'd drop by
and cheer you up a bit.

134
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:07,728
I'll be seeing you, Matt, in the bread line.

135
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,228
That ham I had this morning...

136
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:13,943
Gentlemen, let's get organised
before Dickson gets here.

137
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:16,108
- Schultz, can I count on you?
- Absolutely.

138
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:18,526
- What about you, Ames?
- That's how I feel about it.

139
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,652
Ives, how about you?

140
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:22,581
- Well, the way I look at it...
- All right. O'Brien?

141
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,952
You've got an awful fight on your hands.
That's all I've got to say.

142
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,880
Gentlemen, I think that it's time
that we do fight.

143
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:36,969
- Hello, Gardiner.
- Good morning.

144
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,841
You're on time this morning. It's about time.

145
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:43,182
- Good morning, Mr Dickson.
- John, how's your wife this morning?

146
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:45,889
- Much better this morning, thank you.
- Got a handkerchief?

147
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:47,224
Excuse me.

148
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,761
Wait a minute.

149
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:50,139
How do you feel this morning?

150
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:53,187
- I'm feeling fine this morning.
- That makes it unanimous.

151
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:55,650
- I feel all right, too.
- Thank you.

152
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:59,109
- Carter!
- Yes, sir?

153
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:01,117
You know the rules about smoking.

154
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:06,285
Thank you, sir.

155
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:08,113
Oh, Matt.

156
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,794
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

157
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,955
- Hello, Tom.
- You here again? What do you want?

158
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:16,041
The same as anybody
wants from you, money.

159
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:19,418
- I told you I wasn't interested in that deal.
- But I want to know why.

160
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:22,796
- Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
- I haven't any.

161
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:24,467
- You haven't got a uniform?
- No, sir.

162
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:27,310
You gotta have a uniform.
How much does one cost?

163
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:28,424
I don't know.

164
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,678
Tell Mr Sampson I sent you.
Gotta have a uniform.

165
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:32,765
I never had trouble
borrowing from you before.

166
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:34,731
When I was broke, you gave me all I wanted.

167
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:37,818
- Now I come to you with a swell deal...
- I don't like your crowd.

168
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:39,778
You can have all the credit you want.

169
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:41,145
For that deal, not a cent.

170
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:43,317
- But listen...
- Good morning, Mrs Pembroke.

171
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,237
- Get my letter?
- Yes, thank you.

172
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:46,573
- Hello, Helen.
- Good morning.

173
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:49,664
You're becoming more beautiful every day.
What do we do about it?

174
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:51,160
I don't know.

175
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:54,164
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank,
that's all.

176
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:57,000
When are you and Matt
going to get married?

177
00:09:57,422 --> 00:10:00,044
- Well, I...
- Stalling, eh?

178
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:02,291
Anything new?

179
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:05,173
The directors are waiting for you
in the boardroom.

180
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:06,544
Directors?

181
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:09,714
Long faces?

182
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,758
Longer.

183
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:15,557
And I haven't got any new stories
for them this morning, either.

184
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,226
- Mr Dickson.
- Mrs Pembroke.

185
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,852
I spoke to Mr Schaffer at the Guaranty.
He'll take care of your mortgage.

186
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,320
Mrs Dickson's on the phone.

187
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,026
You'd better hurry over there.
He's waiting for you.

188
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,776
Hello, dear. Yeah.

189
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,822
Where are you?

190
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,820
Sure. Come on down, right away.

191
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:35,083
Yes, of course I remember. It's tonight.

192
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,785
See what a social hound I'm becoming?

193
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,665
All right. Goodbye, dear.

194
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:45,169
But, Mr Dickson, I thought you were
taking care of the mortgage.

195
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,633
I only want $10,000,
the property is worth $60,000.

196
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:51,054
Mr Schaffer will take care of you.
He'll give you $15,000 or $20,000.

197
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:53,631
Better hurry now. Goodbye.
Good luck to you.

198
00:10:53,726 --> 00:10:57,142
If Mrs Dickson comes in, tell her
to see Cluett if she needs any money.

199
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,396
What's the idea of turning her down?
Sounded like a safe investment.

200
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:03,104
She's a widow.
I don't like to take mortgages from widows.

201
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:04,273
Well, why not?

202
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:07,398
- lf she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose.
- Yeah, sure.

203
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:09,150
"Yeah, sure."

204
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:13,155
Make that uniform blue.

205
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:14,492
Yes, sir.

206
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:23,041
One, two, three, four, five.

207
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:26,753
Seven more and you'd have a jury.

208
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,339
Well, it's a nice morning, gentlemen.

209
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,677
How about two foursomes of golf, huh?

210
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:37,135
I say, that...

211
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:41,814
You know I found out something
about hitting a golf ball.

212
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:44,222
Hit it with the left hand,
and from the inside out.

213
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:46,523
- It's the only way...
- We'd like to have a little

214
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,189
of your very valuable time here at the bank
this morning, if you don't mind.

215
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:52,740
You would?

216
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
All right.

217
00:11:58,414 --> 00:12:01,331
If it's more important than golf, go ahead.

218
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,583
What's on your mind?

219
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:10,206
- The cheque is no good.
- What?

220
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,051
The cheque is no good.
The man has no account here.

221
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:16,172
- Holy mackerel! I've been robbed.
- I'm sorry, madam.

222
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:18,843
So am I. And don't call me madam.

223
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,468
Yes, ma'am,
you can deposit your money here.

224
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,139
- Is it safe?
- Absolutely.

225
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:26,602
- It's his life insurance money.
- That's all right.

226
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,141
You come with me and I'll show you
where to deposit your money.

227
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,912
There he is.

228
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:58,086
Good morning, gentlemen.

229
00:12:58,805 --> 00:13:00,632
- Who do you want to see?
- You.

230
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:03,297
Yeah, we want to talk to you
about a big deal.

231
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:04,471
Oh, yes?

232
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:07,302
Well, come right this way.

233
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,230
Hey, Pat, come here. Look!

234
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:29,954
That's Dude Finlay.
I've seen his picture in the papers.

235
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,534
- I wonder what he's doing with Mr Cluett.
- I'm scared.

236
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:35,298
He's one of the toughest gangsters in town.

237
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:42,045
Gentlemen, you're only wasting your time.
There'll be no merger.

238
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:44,344
Why should I turn this bank over
to anybody else?

239
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:46,140
I've worked 25 years to build it up

240
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,431
and now you ask me
to dump it into somebody's lap.

241
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:49,550
Nothing doing.

242
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,683
You could make a handsome profit
on your stock.

243
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:54,441
I'm not interested in profits.
I'm interested in the bank.

244
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:55,900
The depositors are my friends.

245
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:58,225
They need my protection.
I won't walk out on them.

246
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:01,735
How are you protecting your depositors?
By making a lot of idiotic loans?

247
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:02,902
Take it easy, Clark.

248
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:04,450
- My dear friends...
- It's all right.

249
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:06,656
Let him speak his piece. I like it. Go on.

250
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:08,404
All right, I'll speak my piece.

251
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,655
Dickson, you've got to change your policy.

252
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,291
What's the matter with my policy?

253
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,045
How many losses has this bank taken
in the last 25 years?

254
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:16,622
I'll tell you, not a single one.

255
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:19,038
- What's wrong with that kind of banking?
- Pure luck.

256
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:21,503
Conditions have changed.
These are precarious times.

257
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:25,459
Banks today have got to be careful.
And you've been more liberal than ever.

258
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,345
Yes, and I'll continue to be liberal.

259
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,385
The trouble with this country is
there's too much hoarded cash.

260
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,219
Idle money is no good to industry.

261
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:34,848
Where's all the money today? In the banks,

262
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:37,974
vaults, socks,
old tin cans buried in the ground.

263
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:40,272
We've got to get the money in circulation

264
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,565
before you'll get this country
back to prosperity.

265
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,860
Who are we going to give it to?
Men like Jones?

266
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:48,648
Last week you made him an extra loan
of $50,000. Is that intelligent banking?

267
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:51,993
Can't pay his bills.
How do you expect him to pay us?

268
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,072
That's a fair question, Schultz.

269
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:58,036
Let's see how bad a risk Jones is.
What's his history?

270
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:00,416
He's been a successful businessman
for 35 years.

271
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:02,996
Two years ago, business started falling off.

272
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,549
Today, Jones needs money.

273
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:06,958
And if he doesn't get it,
he goes into bankruptcy

274
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:08,463
and throws 900 men out of work.

275
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,344
Answer: unemployment.

276
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:14,218
It also means his creditors aren't paid.
They're in trouble.

277
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:17,643
They go to the banks and are turned down.
More bankruptcies.

278
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,271
It's a vicious circle, my friends,

279
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:22,024
and the only place to cure it
is right here at the source.

280
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:24,563
Help Jones and you help the whole circle.

281
00:15:24,694 --> 00:15:27,066
When Jones comes to me,
I ask myself two questions,

282
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:29,396
first, is he honest? Yes.

283
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,898
Second, is he as good a businessman
as he was before?

284
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:35,029
And the answer is, he's better.
He is not only older and wiser

285
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:37,742
but his present trouble
has taught him precaution.

286
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:40,952
In my estimation, gentlemen,
Jones is no risk.

287
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:44,164
Neither are the thousands of other Joneses
across the country.

288
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:46,924
It's they who made this nation
the richest in the world

289
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:49,759
and it's up to the banks
to give them a break.

290
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:54,050
Disraeli said,
"Security is the prosperity of a nation."

291
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:55,965
Disraeli didn't say anything of the kind.

292
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:58,133
He should have.
It's as true now as it was then.

293
00:15:58,226 --> 00:16:00,053
But let's get the right kind of security.

294
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:02,268
Not stocks and bonds
that zigzag up and down.

295
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,063
Not collateral on paper, but character.

296
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:05,607
Character. That's your idea.

297
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:09,025
It's Alexander Hamilton's idea.
The finest banking mind of this country.

298
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:10,771
Those were his exact words, gentlemen,

299
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:12,855
"Character is the only thing
you can bank on

300
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:16,732
"and it's the only thing that'll
pull this country out of the doldrums."

301
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:25,293
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett,
don't you?

302
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:27,002
I know, Dude.

303
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,672
I must have been crazy.
I lost my head completely.

304
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,549
That's your funeral.

305
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:34,592
We've got $50,000 coming to us.

306
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:37,844
- I haven't got it.
- Then what did you want to gamble for?

307
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:41,216
If you'd have beat us out of $50,000,
you'd have been paid.

308
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,224
Well, we want our dough.

309
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:45,849
- I'm sorry, Dude, but I...
- That don't do us any good.

310
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,690
After all, you can't take blood from a stone.

311
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,143
We can take blood from anything
if it's coming to us.

312
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,652
Perhaps if you'll wait a little while

313
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:00,699
- I might be able...
- We've waited long enough.

314
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,984
Nix. Lay off.

315
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,831
What's the use of getting excited, Cluett?

316
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,705
It ought to be easy for you
to lay your mitts on that kind of dough.

317
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,127
There's plenty of it in this bank
laying around loose.

318
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,208
Good Heavens, man!

319
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,505
- You're not suggesting that I...
- Why not?

320
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:20,963
- I couldn't do that.
- You don't have to do nothing.

321
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:24,556
What do you mean?

322
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:27,559
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us

323
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:30,222
and we'll do the rest, see?

324
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,485
No. No, I couldn't.

325
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:42,648
I couldn't do anything like it.

326
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,613
All right.

327
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,499
- Good morning, Helen.
- Good morning.

328
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:54,040
Is that busy husband of mine busy?

329
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,128
He's at a board meeting.

330
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:58,090
Board meeting?

331
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:01,628
That means hours, I suppose.

332
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,965
I'm afraid so.

333
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,180
Helen, did you ever try
competing with a bank?

334
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:07,338
No.

335
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:10,350
Take my word for it, and don't try it.
It's useless.

336
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:13,176
If it were another woman,
I could handle her,

337
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:16,357
but after all, you can't scratch
a bank's eyes out, now, can you?

338
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,818
Hardly.

339
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:20,392
Oh, well, I guess
the only other thing for me to do

340
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:23,060
is go out and buy myself
a few sticks of dynamite.

341
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:26,907
When he comes out, tell him I'll be back.
He hasn't gotten rid of me.

342
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:28,321
All right.

343
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:31,284
Dude,

344
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:35,035
there's not any chance of my
becoming involved in this, is there?

345
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:39,373
You? No, you'll be all right
so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.

346
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:42,382
- I know, but...
- Be sure to be with somebody responsible

347
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:45,467
in case any questions are asked.
Understand?

348
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:47,296
But, Dude, listen.

349
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:49,096
Couldn't we make this some other time?

350
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:52,965
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy.
Quit squawking.

351
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:23,453
Hello, Phyllis.

352
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:26,549
This won't do. Not during business hours.

353
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:29,926
I needed a... Want one?

354
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:31,805
Heavens, no!

355
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:33,675
Do you mind putting up with me

356
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:36,932
until the financial genius
gets through geniusing?

357
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:38,928
No. Of course not, not at all.

358
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,220
Here.

359
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,859
Why, what is the matter with you?
You're trembling.

360
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:53,230
Am I?

361
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:56,619
Why, I don't know any reason
why I should be,

362
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,036
- unless, of course, it's you.
- Me?

363
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:03,789
Being alone with you has always
done this to me. You know that.

364
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,749
For a celebrated bounder,
that is an awful admission.

365
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,540
Besides, I didn't know that any female
could do this to you.

366
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:12,592
You can. You always could.

367
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,429
Liar! You're just suffering
from lack of sleep.

368
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,008
Here, now.

369
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:20,843
Now, don't you go to work on me, too.
I'm getting tired of this.

370
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,557
Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks.

371
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:26,437
The running around. Not the work.

372
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:28,899
You better start reforming, Cyril.

373
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:32,271
If I thought you were the slightest bit
interested, I would.

374
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,069
Not bad, not bad at all.

375
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,783
Do you know something?

376
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:42,489
- I've always been curious about your line.
- Line?

377
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:45,749
Or whatever it is that makes you
such a riot with women.

378
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:49,289
Come on, Cyril. Try a little of it out on me.

379
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:53,965
I haven't had any first-class blarney
thrown at me since the day I was married.

380
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:57,010
But, you see, it isn't blarney
where you're concerned.

381
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,678
Now, let me see. What comes next?

382
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:01,390
Oh, yes, I know.

383
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:05,143
"What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?"

384
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,512
- Tonight?
- Doesn't that come next?

385
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,771
Yes, it does.

386
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:14,903
What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?

387
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:16,566
See, we're getting along famously.

388
00:21:16,823 --> 00:21:18,696
Most of the depositors I know personally.

389
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:21,569
I've seen them grow up.
I knew their parents before them.

390
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,697
I know, that's all very well,
but you're taking too many chances.

391
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:27,705
In these times, a bank should keep liquid
in case of emergency.

392
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,412
I know what you mean.
You want me to hang on to our cash.

393
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:34,666
I don't believe in it. The law demands
that I carry a certain legal reserve, and I do.

394
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:38,291
The rest of our money is out working,
to help industry and business.

395
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:40,876
Meanwhile, you're jeopardizing
the safety of the bank.

396
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:42,964
Well, we won't stand for it.

397
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,094
You'll have to stand for it.

398
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:47,429
But my dear friends...

399
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,476
You're forcing us to take action against you.

400
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:51,471
Go ahead, take all the action you want.

401
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:54,268
I'm running this bank my way.
Get that clear!

402
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:58,357
Gentlemen, you'll notice that Mr Dickson
refuses to consider our wishes.

403
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:00,937
He refuses an offer to merge
with the New York Trust,

404
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,320
the only thing that'll put this bank
on safe ground.

405
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:06,362
He insists upon running a bank
on so flimsy a thing as faith.

406
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:09,324
You said it. That's the only thing
that means anything to me.

407
00:22:09,414 --> 00:22:12,580
Before I take a man into this bank
and extend credit to anyone,

408
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:15,752
I satisfy myself on one thing,
do I believe in him?

409
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:19,165
So far, my judgement has been right, 100%.

410
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:22,009
When I start going wrong,
you won't have to take any action.

411
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:25,509
I'll turn the bank over to you,
and then you can merge all you want to.

412
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:27,969
I won't be the fellow to run it then.

413
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:30,051
Good day, gentlemen.

414
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:40,186
- Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,899
And after dinner we could go...

416
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,658
No, I think I've done enough experimenting
for one day.

417
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,785
Congratulations, Cyril.
You've convinced me

418
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,495
that you're a philanderer
of the very first order.

419
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,752
- I shall recommend you highly.
- Please don't laugh at me, Phyllis.

420
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,377
- I must see you tonight.
- Tonight? Never.

421
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,669
Tonight I have reserved
for a very special occasion.

422
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,845
Believe it or not,
it's our wedding anniversary.

423
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,726
Tom doesn't probably even remember it.

424
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,383
But then, they never do, do they?

425
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,352
- No...
- But I've planned a party for him,

426
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:21,898
a real old-fashioned surprise party:
caps, bells, whistles, and everything.

427
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,732
I'm really terribly excited about it.
I've been planning it for months.

428
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,900
Well...

429
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,151
Well, what?

430
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,697
- Well, aren't you going to invite me?
- You?

431
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:36,245
No can do. It's all set.
Just a few of Tom's closest friends.

432
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,656
Phyllis, if you don't invite me,
I'm coming anyway.

433
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,585
Don't be silly, Cyril.
These are respectable people.

434
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,418
- They'd probably bore you to death.
- No, they won't, not when you're there.

435
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:48,377
Please, come on, be a sport. Please ask me.

436
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,262
- Why are you so anxious?
- Don't you know?

437
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:52,668
No.

438
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,090
- I want to be near you.
- What?

439
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,590
- I've been crazy about you for years.
- Wait a minute.

440
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:00,010
I've always loved you,
long before you married Tom.

441
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:02,180
- Why, Cyril, you're insane.
- No, I'm not.

442
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:05,559
I deliberately avoided you.
I was afraid of making a fool of myself.

443
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,643
But I won't stand it any longer.

444
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:34,959
Please forgive me, Phyllis.

445
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:37,461
I lost my head for a moment,
but I couldn't help it.

446
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:40,842
Please stop apologising.
You're making it far too important.

447
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:43,889
Hi, Matt.

448
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:52,315
Matt, where have you been?
Mr Dickson wants to see you right away.

449
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:54,112
Hurry up.

450
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:03,456
I heard the merger isn't going through.
Isn't that grand?

451
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:04,915
Yeah, swell.

452
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:12,708
Well, Matt, get ready for the big moment.

453
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:15,379
Starting tomorrow,
you become assistant cashier.

454
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:17,333
How's that?

455
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:19,293
It's all right. Thanks.

456
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:21,795
What's more, keep up the good work,
and who knows,

457
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,927
someday you'll be the fellow
sitting behind that desk.

458
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:27,347
Not a bad thought, eh?

459
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:32,472
What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited about it.

460
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:34,525
Sure, I think it's swell.

461
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:36,484
Come on, show a little enthusiasm.

462
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:38,398
What's the matter? You sick or something?

463
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,861
Go on, fake it, even if it isn't real.

464
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,859
I'm sorry, Mr Dickson.

465
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:45,534
It's just kind of sudden, that's all.

466
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:48,948
Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only...

467
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:53,660
You've done so much for me already,
I'll never be able to thank you enough.

468
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,581
Forget it. You came through, didn't you?

469
00:25:55,673 --> 00:25:58,958
That's all I wanted.
Lot of them didn't think you would.

470
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,881
You don't know how much satisfaction
it's been to me.

471
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,548
It's been swell.

472
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:07,094
When are you and Helen
going to get married?

473
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:08,507
Well, I...

474
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:10,844
I suppose you want me
to fix that up for you, too?

475
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:15,058
Well, look who's here. Hello, darling.

476
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,395
Hello, darling.

477
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:21,738
Well, if this isn't a red-letter day
for Tom Dickson.

478
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:23,779
First I trample on the board of directors,

479
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:27,069
then I promote Matt to assistant cashier,
and to complete the day,

480
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:30,281
I've a visit from my sweet,
lovely, gorgeous wife.

481
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:31,915
What a man!

482
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:36,162
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely,
gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.

483
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:38,079
That has the earmarks...

484
00:26:43,092 --> 00:26:47,422
Are you still here? Go on, go to work.
What do you think I pay you for?

485
00:26:50,184 --> 00:26:52,935
What happened? What did he say?
Did you get the job?

486
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,264
Yeah.

487
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:58,474
What's the matter, Matt?
I thought you'd be thrilled to death.

488
00:26:58,567 --> 00:26:59,894
Come here.

489
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:05,112
A few minutes ago I was in Clue's office,
and Mrs Dickson was there.

490
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:07,356
- Well?
- He was making love to her.

491
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,867
- Matt, you must be mistaken.
- I tell you, I saw them.

492
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:13,622
- In Clue's office?
- Yes, right in his office, the rat.

493
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:15,615
I'd like to take a crack at that guy.

494
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,167
Wait a minute. Don't go away.

495
00:27:18,251 --> 00:27:19,662
Yes, George.

496
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:21,743
Yeah, sure.

497
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,337
That's for tonight?

498
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:28,252
Yes, certainly I'll be there. Yes.

499
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:31,137
We'll go down together

500
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:33,431
and have dinner in Philadelphia.

501
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:35,136
That's right.

502
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:38,386
Just as soon as the bank closes.

503
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:40,022
Right. Bye.

504
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:43,646
<i>Sir?</i>

505
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:45,774
I'm going to Philadelphia
when the bank closes.

506
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:48,353
<i>- Make all the arrangements, will you?
- Yes, sir.</i>

507
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:53,195
What's the matter, dear?
What have I done now?

508
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:56,074
Nothing.

509
00:27:57,706 --> 00:28:00,577
I thought you were going out
with me tonight.

510
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:03,584
I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?

511
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,785
Yes.

512
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,714
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about it.
I'm so sorry.

513
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,215
You simply cannot go to Philadelphia
tonight, that's all there is to it.

514
00:28:11,302 --> 00:28:14,837
- I've got to go. It's an important...
- I don't care if it's important or not.

515
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,639
You said you were going out with me.

516
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:20,508
If you hadn't promised so faithfully,
I wouldn't have planned the whole thing.

517
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:23,770
It's not so terribly important.
We can go to the theatre anytime.

518
00:28:23,856 --> 00:28:26,857
- The theatre?
- That's what was your plan, wasn't it?

519
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:28,648
Yes, of course.

520
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:31,357
You can take some of the girls.
Take Mildred, or Gwen.

521
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:32,526
The girls.

522
00:28:32,865 --> 00:28:37,194
Did it ever occur to you I might go out
and find myself an attractive young man?

523
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:39,529
"Ho, ho, ho," yourself.

524
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:42,030
I wouldn't laugh if I were you.

525
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:45,078
You may not suspect it,
but I'm still attractive to some.

526
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:48,501
Now, listen, don't you go around
being attractive to anybody but me.

527
00:28:48,588 --> 00:28:51,374
Don't you forget that I'm still
the headman around here, too.

528
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,791
We're gonna change those tickets
for tomorrow night.

529
00:28:53,884 --> 00:28:56,457
And you and I are going out together.
How's that?

530
00:28:56,553 --> 00:28:58,047
- Tomorrow night?
- Yes.

531
00:28:59,014 --> 00:29:00,924
<i>- Yes?
- Mr Gardiner's here.</i>

532
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:03,804
Oh, yes. That's that lawyer.
Let him have $9,000.

533
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:07,471
I'll step you around this town
like you've never been stepped before.

534
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:10,482
We'll have dinner at the St Regis,
go to a nice snappy show,

535
00:29:10,568 --> 00:29:13,902
then to a nightclub, sit and listen
to the soft music, and who knows?

536
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:16,609
I might break down and dance with you.

537
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,530
All right. That's good. And I'll postpone
the whole thing until tomorrow night.

538
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:24,031
Are you happy now?

539
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:25,612
No.

540
00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:28,954
Poor kid, you have been neglected,
haven't you?

541
00:29:29,085 --> 00:29:31,755
I don't care, darling. I love you anyway.

542
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:35,918
<i>- Yes?
- Mr Sampson.</i>

543
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,632
All right. Send him in.

544
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:42,960
- Sampson, what is it?
- Here's the data on the Clyde deal.

545
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:46,011
Good. I'll take this with me.
Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow.

546
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:49,138
- I'm sick and tired of this delay.
- I'm afraid he's been stalling.

547
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,601
Exactly. This deal should have been closed
weeks ago.

548
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,774
- Tell him to keep tomorrow open.
- He says he can't in the daytime.

549
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,853
How about his nights?
Too busy running around?

550
00:29:56,946 --> 00:30:00,480
Tell him to come sign this thing
tomorrow night, or this whole deal is off.

551
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:03,610
I'm sick of these people dilly-dallying.
Can't make up their minds.

552
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:20,755
- Everybody in?
- I guess so.

553
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:24,922
- Where's Charlie?
- Charlie's upstairs, sore as a pup.

554
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:27,552
He's out 14 cents and he can't find it.

555
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:35,813
- Good night.
- Good night.

556
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:46,450
What's keeping you?

557
00:30:46,743 --> 00:30:48,535
Charlie again.

558
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,997
Say, Matt, you haven't done anything
about what you saw today, have you?

559
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:56,869
Cluett? No, not yet.

560
00:30:58,004 --> 00:31:00,958
But I'd like to take a crack
at that stiff-necked horse collar.

561
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:02,672
Don't be silly.

562
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:04,881
Can you imagine that guy?
He was kissing her.

563
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:07,091
You've got me worried, dear.

564
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:11,673
- Promise me you won't butt in.
- Okay, honey.

565
00:31:12,183 --> 00:31:14,674
But just the same, I'd like
to take a crack at that...

566
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:16,892
- I'll wait for you upstairs.
- All right, dear.

567
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:20,972
Where you been?

568
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:24,519
Where do you think I've been?
I took the baby for a stroll in the park.

569
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:28,904
What's the matter, Charlie?

570
00:31:28,992 --> 00:31:32,158
I'm 14 cents out and it took me half an hour
to find the mistake.

571
00:31:32,245 --> 00:31:33,620
And me with a date, too.

572
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,491
Ah, once when your accounts checked.

573
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,578
Listen, wise guy, I'm setting friend
time clock for exactly 9:00

574
00:31:43,672 --> 00:31:45,665
so no squawks out of you guys
in the morning.

575
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:48,379
Say, don't annoy me.
I got troubles of my own.

576
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:18,910
- Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
- Yes, sir.

577
00:32:18,998 --> 00:32:20,741
Let me see your cashbook, will you?

578
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,541
- Now?
- Yes, now.

579
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:25,908
All right, sir.

580
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:07,457
That's all right.
Seems to me you're carrying too much cash.

581
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:45,543
- Driver.
- Yes?

582
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:47,714
- Have you the correct time?
- 12:05.

583
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:49,762
Thanks.

584
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,436
- What's this?
- My apartment.

585
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:57,181
I knew I couldn't trust you.

586
00:34:57,524 --> 00:35:00,975
- You told me you were taking me home.
- Come on up for just a few minutes.

587
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:04,770
- We'll have just one drink and then we'll go.
- I know the answer to that one.

588
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:06,442
I think you'd better take me home.

589
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:09,487
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?

590
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:13,161
No, I'm afraid papa isn't
that much interested.

591
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,078
He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia

592
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:19,371
to make stuffy old speeches
at stuffy old bankers' meetings.

593
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:22,035
Too busy closing big, important...

594
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:26,716
- I think I will have a drink.
- Good for you. Come on.

595
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:31,598
There ought to be a Congressional medal
for men like you.

596
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:34,718
America's comfort to misunderstood wives.

597
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,885
I never thought I'd find myself in that crowd.

598
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:38,223
You're not so badly off.

599
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:40,887
There's something worse
than being a misunderstood wife.

600
00:35:40,983 --> 00:35:43,853
- What is that, Mr Bones?
- A misunderstood bachelor.

601
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:48,816
And now, fair woman,
I have you in my power.

602
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:51,232
I'm not afraid of you.
You haven't got a moustache.

603
00:35:51,325 --> 00:35:54,280
I'll grow a moustache
by the time you get out of here.

604
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,198
Why, Matt.

605
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:05,247
What are you doing here?

606
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:09,460
Well, the butler said I could stay.
I told him it was important.

607
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:11,676
- Oh, yes?
- He's not here.

608
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:15,298
He left at 9:00.
He said you gave him the night off.

609
00:36:15,558 --> 00:36:16,933
What do you want?

610
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,976
I thought I'd like to have
a little talk with you.

611
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:24,558
I'm listening.

612
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:29,774
It's funny, now that I'm here,
I don't know just how to go about it.

613
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:32,438
You see, I kind of expected
to find you here alone.

614
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:34,157
Do you mind stepping outside? We can...

615
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:36,364
Anything you have to say,
say it in the morning.

616
00:36:36,452 --> 00:36:40,035
Oh, no, Mr Cluett.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait.

617
00:36:40,123 --> 00:36:41,451
It's about you and Mrs Dickson.

618
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:43,830
- About me...
- Why, Matt, what are you talking about?

619
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,872
I know I got a lot of nerve butting in,
but I couldn't help it.

620
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:49,798
I wanted to stop you from doing something
you'd be sorry for.

621
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:51,459
I'm not interested in what you think.

622
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,337
You've no right to do it to him.
Why don't you think it over?

623
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:57,547
- It'll only get you in trouble.
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

624
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,513
Then maybe you'll understand,
Mrs Dickson.

625
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,011
He's crazy about you.

626
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:02,643
Nobody knows it better than you.

627
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:06,511
- lf he ever found out, i'd kill him.
- You're mistaken about the whole thing.

628
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:08,100
There isn't anything wrong.

629
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:11,144
- Mr Cluett and I simply...
- Phyllis, you don't have to explain.

630
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:13,643
- You mind your own business.
- This is my business.

631
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:17,486
Mr Dickson's like a father to me.
What's he ever done to you to deserve this?

632
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:20,065
That'll be just about enough.
Now, you get out of here.

633
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,533
Well, I guess I have said enough.

634
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:28,040
- I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
- You're right for the first time. Now, get out.

635
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:31,621
I'm appealing to you, Mrs Dickson.
Think what you're doing to him.

636
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:34,834
You're passing up the whitest man on earth
for a dirty, no-good...

637
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,550
Cyril.

638
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:42,931
Now, get out of here.

639
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,150
Wait a minute, Matt. I'll go with you.

640
00:38:01,242 --> 00:38:03,531
But you needn't go on account of this idiot.

641
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:07,699
You better carry that around with you
all the time. You're going to need it.

642
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,298
- What do you say, Doc?
- I'd say about eight or nine hours.

643
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,804
Well, you'd better call the coroner.

644
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,640
Say, fellas, I was the first one to see him.

645
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,011
I was coming down the steps

646
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,395
and there was the watchman
lying dead at my feet.

647
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,559
You coulve knocked me over with a pin.

648
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,728
Do you see that clock?

649
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:11,611
Right there, that's where the bullet hit it.

650
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:15,199
Well, when I saw that,
you coulve knocked me over with a pin.

651
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:17,072
- Was there much blood?
- Blood?

652
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:19,489
- Come on over, fellows, I'll show you.
- Get back.

653
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,283
I don't want nothing touched down here
till we get through.

654
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:26,747
- Oscar, what's the matter?
- Say, listen, I was the first one to see it.

655
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,504
I was coming down the steps and there was
the watchman lying dead at my feet.

656
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:31,672
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

657
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:33,837
You coulve knocked me over with a pin.

658
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,388
- Where's Matt?
- Matt?

659
00:40:35,473 --> 00:40:38,342
He'll have a tough time
thinking up a wisecrack for this one.

660
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:40,841
The detective's got Matt upstairs
in Sampson's office.

661
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:43,641
- Say, did Matt do it?
- Don't look at me, I don't know.

662
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:46,304
He was acting kind of funny yesterday,
didn't you notice?

663
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,024
- Yes, he did.
- I noticed it, too.

664
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,398
You coulve knocked me over with a pin.

665
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:52,942
Come on, tell the truth.
What'd you do with the money?

666
00:40:53,031 --> 00:40:54,691
I didn't do it. I told you all I know.

667
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:57,487
You turned off the burglar alarm,
you set the time clock,

668
00:40:57,618 --> 00:40:59,445
came back at 12:00 and emptied the boxes.

669
00:40:59,537 --> 00:41:01,281
- I wasn't anywhere near here!
- Sit down.

670
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:04,208
When the watchman surprised you,
you shot him. Where's the gun?

671
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:06,284
- I haven't got one.
- But you used to carry one.

672
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,833
Pardon me,
but I'd like to use my office for a while.

673
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:10,914
You use some other office.

674
00:41:13,926 --> 00:41:15,385
Come on, open up.

675
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:21,881
- What's the matter here?
- Gonna open today?

676
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:23,884
Of course. Come on, open this door.

677
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:28,144
- Shall we let the people come in?
- Of course, let them in. You're late now.

678
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:30,189
Hurry up. Open the rest of the doors.

679
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:34,109
Mr Dickson, they're going to arrest Matt.
They think he did it.

680
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:36,104
- Where is he now?
- In Mr Sampson's office.

681
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:37,359
Don't you worry about it.

682
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:42,025
- Then you did it alone!
- What's the matter? What's going on here?

683
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,120
This is ridiculous. You can't hold this boy
on a vague suspicion.

684
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:47,448
- I'm afraid I must, Mr Dickson.
- Why pick on him?

685
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:49,369
It's an inside job, that's a cinch.

686
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,496
Whoever did it
had a pretty good picture of the layout.

687
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:55,044
- Brown is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
- Yes.

688
00:41:55,132 --> 00:41:58,300
The burglar alarm was turned off.
The time clock was set for 12:00.

689
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:00,923
- What more do you want?
- Somebody else coulve done it.

690
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:03,848
- He admits setting it himself.
- I did, for 9:00 this morning.

691
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:05,426
- Then who changed it?
- I don't know!

692
00:42:05,517 --> 00:42:08,683
Wait a minute.
What time did you say this thing happened?

693
00:42:09,187 --> 00:42:12,188
The clock opposite the vault
was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.

694
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:15,026
If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right,
isn't he?

695
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,232
- lf he can do it, yes.
- He certainly can.

696
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,355
Matt, all you got to do is tell them
where you were last night

697
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:23,614
between 12:00 and 12:30
and everything will be all right.

698
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,699
I already told him, I was home.

699
00:42:25,952 --> 00:42:27,945
- There you are.
- That's what he says.

700
00:42:28,288 --> 00:42:30,993
I got a man from headquarters
checking up on it now.

701
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:33,040
Good. Nothing to worry about.

702
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:35,368
As soon as the report comes in,
you'll be released.

703
00:42:35,462 --> 00:42:39,163
Listen, don't talk so loud.
Take it easy. Coast a little.

704
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:43,133
What do you think?
There was that poor watchman

705
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:47,134
lying on the floor right in front of me.
You coulve knocked me over with a pin.

706
00:42:47,224 --> 00:42:51,221
- You don't say. Dead?
- Dead. He was lifeless.

707
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:53,137
You know, I was the first one to see him.

708
00:42:53,229 --> 00:42:55,898
I was coming down the steps,
and there was the watchman

709
00:42:55,982 --> 00:43:00,312
lying on the floor right in front of me, dead.
You coulve knocked me over...

710
00:43:00,403 --> 00:43:03,273
Yeah, I coulve knocked you over
with a pin.

711
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:04,527
Yeah, you coulve knocked...

712
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:07,366
- Hello, Mayme, this is Gerda again.
- Almonds to you.

713
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,617
Say, listen, I just heard something
that'll make your head swim.

714
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:11,949
Listen to this,

715
00:43:12,038 --> 00:43:14,327
the bank was robbed last night.

716
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:16,824
Yeah, over $100,000.

717
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:18,248
Who did it?

718
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:21,829
I don't know who did it,
but the chief teller's in an awful jam.

719
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:25,458
Call me up later.
I'm going to call up Lou now.

720
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:31,220
Hello, Lou? Did you hear what happened
over at the Union National Bank?

721
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:34,013
Wait a minute, Lou. Hello.

722
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:38,430
Yes, sir, I'm trying to get them.
Yes, Lou, listen.

723
00:43:38,522 --> 00:43:42,935
It was robbed of over $200,000.
Can you beat that?

724
00:43:43,027 --> 00:43:47,238
- Stole over $250,000. Can you beat that?
- You can't laugh that off.

725
00:43:47,364 --> 00:43:49,357
I thought the Union National
was pretty solid.

726
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,691
I did, too. But $500,000 is a lot of money.

727
00:43:51,785 --> 00:43:54,905
I wouldn't be surprised
if they had to close their doors.

728
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:56,663
Oh, good gracious.

729
00:43:56,748 --> 00:43:59,037
- Sammy, are you sure about that?
- Yes, sir.

730
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:03,587
The messenger boy just told me,
that Mr Dickson took all the money himself.

731
00:44:03,672 --> 00:44:05,415
And it was more than a million dollars.

732
00:44:05,506 --> 00:44:07,998
- More than a million dollars?
- Cross my heart.

733
00:44:08,093 --> 00:44:12,221
And I sure hopes that man
gets a long time in jail, too.

734
00:44:14,515 --> 00:44:16,140
Never mind my shoes, Sam.

735
00:44:16,226 --> 00:44:18,432
I always said the Union National
was a phoney bank.

736
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,800
Union National?

737
00:44:20,187 --> 00:44:22,938
- You had money in that bank, too?
- Yes. Something wrong?

738
00:44:23,023 --> 00:44:25,230
<i>Mon Dieu! Run, run.</i>

739
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:27,393
- You're telling me!
- You are a poor man.

740
00:44:27,486 --> 00:44:30,903
I got it from the best authority.
Dickson got away with several million.

741
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,899
That's the end of the Union National Bank.

742
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:35,564
That's the trouble nowadays.
You don't know who to trust.

743
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,736
Is there something wrong
with Union National Bank?

744
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:39,537
Brother, that ain't the half of it.

745
00:44:39,623 --> 00:44:41,579
If you have money in there, kiss it goodbye.

746
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,742
- No, you're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

747
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:44,914
Holy smoke.

748
00:44:45,003 --> 00:44:46,912
Got any friends?
You better call them up, too.

749
00:44:47,005 --> 00:44:49,128
That's a good idea.
I have friends of my own.

750
00:44:49,216 --> 00:44:51,706
- Can you imagine that?
- What bank did you say that was?

751
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:54,423
Union National Bank. They're broke.
Haven't got a dime.

752
00:44:54,512 --> 00:44:57,514
Jack, go to the Union National Bank
and take your money out.

753
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,054
Don't ask me how I know.
I tell you it's on the rocks.

754
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:01,720
You'd better tell your friends, too.

755
00:45:01,811 --> 00:45:04,433
Better give your men some time off
to get their money out.

756
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:07,060
Tell Mrs Hardy to tell everyone
in the apartment house.

757
00:45:07,149 --> 00:45:09,106
All right. I'll get it or bust a few noses.

758
00:45:09,192 --> 00:45:11,315
I'll get right down there if I have to fly.

759
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:13,859
Run down there
and get your money at once.

760
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:18,783
Hello, dear. Have you heard the news?

761
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:20,327
Please hurry. Just now.

762
00:45:20,411 --> 00:45:21,609
Union National is sunk.

763
00:45:21,704 --> 00:45:23,827
We should have put it in the vault.

764
00:45:24,624 --> 00:45:26,415
Call the Kincaids and tell them about it.

765
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,663
I don't know what's wrong.

766
00:45:27,752 --> 00:45:28,783
I wouldn't trust anybody.

767
00:45:28,878 --> 00:45:30,456
Everybody's taking their money out.

768
00:45:30,546 --> 00:45:31,578
Union National's broke.

769
00:45:31,673 --> 00:45:32,752
Holy John Judas Priest.

770
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:34,747
Our money's all gone.

771
00:45:34,842 --> 00:45:35,873
It hasn't a chance.

772
00:45:35,968 --> 00:45:36,999
Okay, honey, I'll go right down.

773
00:45:37,094 --> 00:45:38,174
You better hurry up, too.

774
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:39,294
If you don't hurry...

775
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:40,468
Don't lose a moment.

776
00:45:40,557 --> 00:45:41,636
What'll we do?

777
00:45:41,724 --> 00:45:42,804
I'm going right down.

778
00:45:42,892 --> 00:45:43,923
Why take any chances?

779
00:45:44,018 --> 00:45:45,097
Mother just told me.

780
00:45:45,186 --> 00:45:46,265
I just heard it.

781
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:47,427
Bank's broke.

782
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:48,601
Hurry up.

783
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:47,658
- Closing your account?
- Yes, sir. I'm closing it.

784
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:49,488
I wouldn't leave a nickel in this bank.

785
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,581
It's getting so a guy's money ain't safe
unless it's in his sock.

786
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,458
- They're a bunch of crooks.
- You said it.

787
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:56,915
<i>Say, did I know the bank
was gonna go mechuleh?</i>

788
00:46:57,004 --> 00:46:58,712
What am I, a fortune teller?

789
00:46:58,797 --> 00:47:03,709
Oh, my goodness!

790
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:07,091
- What's the matter, lady?
- Oh, mister, I gotta.

791
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:10,550
- Well, they only sign slips here.
- Give me your pen, please.

792
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:13,477
Could you loan me that pen of yours?
I'm in an awful hurry.

793
00:47:27,075 --> 00:47:29,862
I'll need some more money.
All the depositors are withdrawing.

794
00:47:29,953 --> 00:47:31,233
I know. I'll get you some.

795
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:34,412
All I know is the bank's been robbed
and a murder's been committed.

796
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:36,455
The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.

797
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:38,867
He didn't have any more
to do with it than you did.

798
00:47:38,961 --> 00:47:40,787
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.

799
00:47:40,879 --> 00:47:43,797
- Kis got a record.
- So have you, so have I, so has everybody.

800
00:47:43,882 --> 00:47:45,211
What difference does that make?

801
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,258
You can't pin crimes on people
just because...

802
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:49,917
- Mr Dickson, can I see you for a minute?
- No, I'm busy.

803
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:52,587
But it's important.
Looks like there's a run on the bank.

804
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:55,256
- What, a run?
- The lobby's half-filled now.

805
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:57,144
What are you talking about?

806
00:47:57,521 --> 00:47:58,635
Look.

807
00:48:00,857 --> 00:48:03,894
They've been coming in all morning.
I've called for extra police.

808
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:06,441
Send down to the vaults.
Have our reserve cash sent up.

809
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:07,608
We haven't much on hand.

810
00:48:07,696 --> 00:48:08,894
I hope we don't have to close.

811
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:10,816
Our reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel.

812
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:13,862
It's just a flurry. They've heard
about the robbery and panicked.

813
00:48:13,953 --> 00:48:16,160
Have our available securities
turned into cash.

814
00:48:16,246 --> 00:48:18,820
Wait. Have my personal stuff
turned into cash, too.

815
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:22,119
Tell the boys anyone caught
arguing with a depositor will be fired.

816
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,539
- We want to talk to you.
- About?

817
00:48:23,629 --> 00:48:25,288
We'll discuss that in the boardroom.

818
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,705
We got a check on Brown's alibi.
You want to hear it?

819
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:29,673
All right. Be with you in a minute, Clark.

820
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:34,134
No need to worry, son. All you got to do
is answer their questions, that's all.

821
00:48:34,222 --> 00:48:36,630
- So you were home last night?
- Yes.

822
00:48:36,724 --> 00:48:38,551
What time did you get there?

823
00:48:38,935 --> 00:48:40,133
About 11:00.

824
00:48:40,228 --> 00:48:42,684
- 11:00? Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

825
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:47,985
All right, Kelly.

826
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:55,316
Do you know this young man,
Mrs Halligan?

827
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:58,244
Sure I do.
He has the best room in me house,

828
00:48:58,329 --> 00:48:59,740
the one with the fancy wallpaper.

829
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,237
Did you happen to be awake
when he came in last night?

830
00:49:02,332 --> 00:49:04,324
Yes, sir. I was having me hot mustard bath.

831
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:06,659
- What time was it?
- For the rheumatism, you know.

832
00:49:06,753 --> 00:49:09,244
- What time was it, Mrs Halligan?
- It was late, I know.

833
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:12,873
The Dooley sisters was already in.
They work at the show, you know.

834
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:14,509
What time was it?

835
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:20,425
- What time did Matt Brown get in?
- Now let me see.

836
00:49:20,766 --> 00:49:24,052
Half an hour after the Dooley sisters,
and the Dooley sisters...

837
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:26,815
I don't care about them.
What time did he get in?

838
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:28,890
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir.

839
00:49:28,983 --> 00:49:31,818
- It was half an hour after the Dooley sisters.
- Was it 12:00?

840
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,689
- No, it wasn't 12:00 'cause the Dooley...
- Was it 1:00?

841
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,231
- Yes, I guess it was 1:00, 'cause...
- It couldn't have been earlier?

842
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:40,401
- No, it wasn't earlier because...
- Yes, I know.

843
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:42,368
Because the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.

844
00:49:42,454 --> 00:49:44,696
No, 'cause me clock struck 4:00

845
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:47,786
and when it strikes 4:00, it's 1:00.

846
00:49:49,168 --> 00:49:51,540
- There you are.
- She doesn't know what she's saying.

847
00:49:51,629 --> 00:49:53,171
Who don't know?

848
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:57,586
Listen here, young man, nobody ever
called me a liar yet and got away with it.

849
00:49:57,676 --> 00:49:59,716
That's all, Mrs Halligan. Thanks.

850
00:49:59,804 --> 00:50:04,346
For two nickels I'd knock his block off.
I never told a lie in me life.

851
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:09,099
- Is this true, Matt?
- Of course it's true, and he knows it.

852
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:12,688
If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you.
Where were you last night?

853
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,898
She was right. I didn't get in till after 1:00.

854
00:50:14,985 --> 00:50:16,729
But I wasn't here, Mr Dickson, honest.

855
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:17,900
- Then where were you?
- Wait.

856
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:20,989
You realise you're being charged
with murder. It's serious, son.

857
00:50:21,075 --> 00:50:24,359
Come on, I know you didn't do it,
but you got to make them believe it.

858
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:27,204
Come on, tell me the truth.
Where were you last night?

859
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,282
I can't tell you.

860
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,995
Listen, if I get them out of the room,
will you tell me?

861
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,621
No, I won't.

862
00:50:38,883 --> 00:50:40,756
- You're protecting somebody.
- No, I'm not.

863
00:50:40,843 --> 00:50:43,678
It doesn't matter who it is.
It can't be as important as this.

864
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:46,170
Now, tell me. Where were you last night?

865
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:49,056
Come on, don't be a fool.

866
00:50:55,441 --> 00:50:58,726
Matt, you trust me, don't you?

867
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:26,172
What a day, Mayme.

868
00:51:26,261 --> 00:51:28,835
Everybody's coming in
to draw their money out.

869
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:31,220
Gee, Mayme, I wonder what started it.

870
00:51:31,308 --> 00:51:33,550
Where's our protection?
That's what I want to know.

871
00:51:33,644 --> 00:51:35,636
How do we know
who we're giving our money to?

872
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:38,220
We're a lot of suckers, that's what we are.

873
00:51:38,315 --> 00:51:42,978
- Outrageous. Positively outrageous.
- It's worse than that, lady. It's lousy.

874
00:51:43,653 --> 00:51:47,734
It's his life insurance money, you know.
But the policeman told me it was all right.

875
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:49,733
- I hope so.
- So do I.

876
00:51:52,244 --> 00:51:56,954
Come on, what are you fellows gaping at?
Come on, go to work. Go on, hurry up.

877
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:05,211
Pay these people their money.
What's the matter?

878
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:08,169
Can't you see this line waiting?
Go ahead. Hurry up.

879
00:52:10,678 --> 00:52:13,596
All right, don't argue with him.
Give it to him.

880
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:15,848
Go on, it's all right. It's enough, too.

881
00:52:16,643 --> 00:52:18,850
- You have enough money here?
- I don't know, sir.

882
00:52:18,938 --> 00:52:20,811
Sure, you're fine, you've got plenty.

883
00:52:20,897 --> 00:52:22,522
- Whose window is this?
- Mat's.

884
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:25,181
Oscar, come here, take this one.
Bring up some money here.

885
00:52:25,277 --> 00:52:27,436
Come on, folks. Stand in line here.

886
00:52:28,363 --> 00:52:30,486
- Where were you?
- Checking up on this account.

887
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:34,024
Never mind that. Go on. Pay them
what they want. Hurry up. Snap into it.

888
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:36,361
Look at them, Mr Dickson.
They're going crazy.

889
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:38,197
Did you cash the securities? Mine, too?

890
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,365
Yes, but when the cash runs out,
they'll mob us.

891
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,700
The fools,
they're making it worse for themselves.

892
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:45,000
Somebody starts a rumour
and they lose their heads.

893
00:52:45,088 --> 00:52:46,546
- What'll we do?
- I'll talk to them.

894
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,915
Tell the boys to stall as much as possible
and to forget what I said.

895
00:52:50,008 --> 00:52:51,633
Tell them to verify every signature.

896
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:01,136
Take your time, folks. Don't get excited.
Everybody stay in line.

897
00:53:01,228 --> 00:53:04,263
You'll all be taken care of.
Don't worry about anything.

898
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,148
Where's my money?

899
00:53:18,578 --> 00:53:21,199
Now, listen, everybody. Listen to me.

900
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:24,449
Your money is safe.
This bank is in excellent condition.

901
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:28,076
If you've heard any report to the contrary,
it's based on malicious rumour.

902
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,250
Yeah, maybe.

903
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:30,583
That's a lot of hooey.

904
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:36,756
- You'll get your money.
- We want it now. We don't want speeches.

905
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:41,138
Listen to me, now. It takes time.

906
00:53:41,223 --> 00:53:44,260
I've got seven paying tellers
working just as fast as they can.

907
00:53:44,352 --> 00:53:45,431
If you'll all calm down,

908
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,770
I'll make arrangements to keep the doors
open till 4:00

909
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:50,765
and you'll all be paid today.

910
00:53:51,943 --> 00:53:55,277
We can't keep open until 4:00.
We haven't cash enough to last an hour.

911
00:53:55,363 --> 00:53:58,233
- Don't you think I know it?
- They're still waiting for you.

912
00:53:58,324 --> 00:54:00,032
Gentlemen, we got one more hour to go.

913
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:02,075
That means we'll be forced
to shut the doors.

914
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:04,734
I've worked 25 years, night and day,
to keep this bank alive.

915
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,324
You made money out of it. Will you help?

916
00:54:06,415 --> 00:54:07,446
What do you mean?

917
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,162
Among you,
you have a million dollars in city banks.

918
00:54:10,252 --> 00:54:12,957
Get that money here
and I'll stop this run in five minutes.

919
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:15,585
Sounds simple,
but why should we jeopardize our fortunes?

920
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:16,919
I have everything I own in it.

921
00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:19,047
- It's your bank as well, isn't it?
- Since when?

922
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,341
The way you've ignored us,
you wouldn't think so.

923
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:22,460
You wouldn't listen to us.

924
00:54:22,555 --> 00:54:24,844
Your depositors were the first ones
to pounce on you.

925
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:27,601
If they're your friends,
why don't you get them to help?

926
00:54:27,685 --> 00:54:29,761
They've gone crazy.
You can't reason with a mob.

927
00:54:29,854 --> 00:54:32,013
You can't reason with anyone
when you're in a jam.

928
00:54:32,106 --> 00:54:34,063
We urged you to keep liquid but you didn't.

929
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:36,985
You preached about faith and other rubbish.
Now you want help.

930
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:39,395
You want us to throw cash
into a bank you will break.

931
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:40,734
There's one way you can get it,

932
00:54:40,823 --> 00:54:42,282
option your stock to us and resign.

933
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:43,397
So that's it?

934
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:45,236
You've waited long for this, haven't you?

935
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:46,988
Well, I won't resign, now or ever.

936
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,320
- You have no choice.
- No? I'll shut the bank first.

937
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:51,288
- You can't do that.
- I can't? Wait and see.

938
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,782
If that run isn't over very soon,
I'll shut the doors.

939
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:56,450
That means the bank examiners
will step in tomorrow.

940
00:54:56,546 --> 00:54:58,753
We'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist on it.

941
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,165
The depositors will be paid
100 cents on the dollar.

942
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:02,587
You can have whatever's left

943
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:06,259
but there won't be enough left
to pay your next month's garage bill.

944
00:55:06,347 --> 00:55:08,553
- Mr Dickson!
- Get all the big bills in the place.

945
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:10,549
Get them changed. Get only ones and fives.

946
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:13,098
Give them to the tellers.
Tell them to take their time.

947
00:55:13,187 --> 00:55:14,930
Stall. Count and re-count the money.

948
00:55:15,022 --> 00:55:17,098
I hate to do this, but I need time to get help.

949
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:18,602
I know where I can get real cash.

950
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:20,981
Snap into it, Sampson.
We'll lick this thing yet.

951
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,694
Bring your book. I want some numbers.

952
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,529
Get Parker at the Union,
Read at the Exchange,

953
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:29,530
Winslow and old man Harris
at the Home Mortgage.

954
00:55:29,953 --> 00:55:32,575
- Snap into it, Helen, quick as you can.
- Yes, sir.

955
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,788
Look at the mob. They're going crazy.

956
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,502
This run isn't doing
the reputation of this bank any good.

957
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:44,706
My dear friends...

958
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:47,126
How much longer
is this Dickson going to hold out?

959
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,386
You know Dickson. He'll shut the doors
before he gives up control.

960
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,880
Let him. I'm sick and tired
of hearing about him.

961
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,216
Let him run the bank.
I don't want any part of it.

962
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,386
- My dear friends...
- Shut up!

963
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,106
Stall!

964
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,362
Is this your signature?

965
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,990
Certainly it's my signature.
You've seen it often enough.

966
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,369
I'm sorry, but I'll have to verify it.

967
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:18,910
Hello, Parker. Listen.

968
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,119
I need $1 million in cash,
and I've got to have it quick.

969
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:25,461
What? No, tomorrow is no good.
I need it now.

970
00:56:25,923 --> 00:56:29,174
Of course it's safe. The bank's
in excellent condition. You know that.

971
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,755
- Chief's car outside?
- Yes, sir.

972
00:56:30,844 --> 00:56:32,007
Okay.

973
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,137
Come on, son. Let's go.

974
00:56:38,936 --> 00:56:40,263
My love.

975
00:56:42,314 --> 00:56:45,019
Don't cry, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

976
00:56:45,108 --> 00:56:46,603
Sorry, sister.

977
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,739
What'd you find out, Mike?

978
00:56:51,823 --> 00:56:53,483
I tailed the cashier like you told me.

979
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:55,568
You're right. There's something screwy.

980
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:57,570
Never mind all that. What did you find out?

981
00:56:57,663 --> 00:57:00,449
He left here an hour ago
and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.

982
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,869
- Dude Finlay's?
- Yes, sir.

983
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:06,252
He stayed about half an hour, and then
came right back here. He's in his office now.

984
00:57:06,337 --> 00:57:07,996
That's when I must have seen that guy.

985
00:57:08,088 --> 00:57:09,796
Did you say Dude Finlay?

986
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:11,628
Yes, why?

987
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:13,633
Why, he was in the bank yesterday.

988
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:14,751
He was here?

989
00:57:14,846 --> 00:57:15,960
He came to see Mr Cluett.

990
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:17,632
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

991
00:57:17,723 --> 00:57:18,753
Who was with him?

992
00:57:18,848 --> 00:57:21,719
Two other men.
They all went in Mr Cluet's office.

993
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:24,010
Now we're beginning to get somewhere.

994
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:26,429
Kelly, you stay here with Brown.

995
00:57:26,522 --> 00:57:30,651
Tim, you and Mike come with me.
We're going down to Cluet's office.

996
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,820
Kelly, call me up in Cluet's office
in about five minutes.

997
00:57:34,906 --> 00:57:36,400
What'll I say?

998
00:57:36,783 --> 00:57:37,946
I don't care what you say.

999
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:40,870
<i>Sing Mother Machree if you want to,
but call me up.</i>

1000
00:57:44,707 --> 00:57:47,495
Quiet down. Take it easy, folks.
Everything'll be all right.

1001
00:57:47,585 --> 00:57:51,168
But you said it was safe.
It's his life insurance money.

1002
00:57:51,255 --> 00:57:55,169
Please, I'll go to the old ladies' home
if you don't do something.

1003
00:57:55,259 --> 00:57:58,628
Take it easy. Be quiet. Everything'll
be all right. Open up here, folks.

1004
00:57:58,721 --> 00:57:59,884
All right, folks, please.

1005
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,511
Good heavens, man,
you're taking no chances.

1006
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:05,172
No, I'm perfectly willing to sign
everything over to you.

1007
00:58:05,268 --> 00:58:07,557
What more do you want? I need action.

1008
00:58:07,812 --> 00:58:10,481
I got to have it within the next half-hour.

1009
00:58:10,564 --> 00:58:14,515
Yes, sure. The board of directors
turned me down, but you know why.

1010
00:58:14,694 --> 00:58:16,521
Listen, Read,

1011
00:58:19,198 --> 00:58:22,069
it wouldn't mean
a drop in the bucket to you.

1012
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:23,864
I see.

1013
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:28,862
Ask me for a favour sometime, will you?

1014
00:58:35,714 --> 00:58:38,798
I hope you don't mind me
asking you a few questions, Mr Cluett.

1015
00:58:38,884 --> 00:58:40,342
Why, of course, yes.

1016
00:58:40,427 --> 00:58:42,301
Just what would you like to know,
Inspector?

1017
00:58:42,387 --> 00:58:44,012
Where were you at 12:00 last night?

1018
00:58:44,098 --> 00:58:45,805
That's very simple. I was home.

1019
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,385
That is simple, isn't it?

1020
00:58:47,475 --> 00:58:49,301
I assume you can prove that if necessary.

1021
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:51,600
Yes, of course. There was someone with me.

1022
00:58:52,063 --> 00:58:53,178
A lady.

1023
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:56,556
Looks like you're going to have
no trouble at all.

1024
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:57,931
What was the lady's name?

1025
00:58:58,027 --> 00:59:02,440
If you don't mind, I'd rather not say,
unless it becomes absolutely essential.

1026
00:59:02,574 --> 00:59:04,233
You see, she's married.

1027
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:07,067
- You understand.
- Why, of course.

1028
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:09,575
Pardon me.

1029
00:59:09,872 --> 00:59:12,245
Hello. Who?

1030
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:16,419
- Yes, he's here. It's for you, Inspector.
- Thanks.

1031
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:19,920
<i>Somebody must be in good humour.
He was humming Mother Machree.</i>

1032
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:21,666
It's one the boys form headquarters.

1033
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:24,510
<i>He always sings Mother Machree
whenever he's got good news.</i>

1034
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,264
Looks like this case will be settled
in no time.

1035
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:28,841
Yeah, Kelly.

1036
00:59:32,644 --> 00:59:34,018
Dude Finlay?

1037
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:36,594
Where you got him?

1038
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:39,603
I ain't got nobody here. I'm with Brown.

1039
00:59:39,691 --> 00:59:41,850
Didn't you tell me to call you
in five minutes?

1040
00:59:41,944 --> 00:59:44,815
Sure. Take him right down to headquarters.

1041
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,479
Yeah.

1042
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,481
What?

1043
00:59:51,537 --> 00:59:54,028
You don't mean Cyril Cluett, the cashier?

1044
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:55,446
Yeah?

1045
00:59:58,293 --> 00:59:59,669
Did Dude Finlay tell you that?

1046
00:59:59,962 --> 01:00:01,077
What?

1047
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:08,124
Dude Finlay? Sure, I got him here.
For a minute, I didn't catch on.

1048
01:00:08,344 --> 01:00:09,507
Yeah.

1049
01:00:12,182 --> 01:00:14,471
We got him right here now.

1050
01:00:18,603 --> 01:00:21,095
Okay, Kelly. Good work. Looks like a...

1051
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,269
Get him!

1052
01:00:25,485 --> 01:00:27,145
There he goes!

1053
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:47,214
He must be here. There's only one door.

1054
01:00:47,299 --> 01:00:48,792
All right. Find him.

1055
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:03,560
- What's that noise?
- Sounded like a locker.

1056
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:07,016
A locker? Search every one of them.
He must be in one.

1057
01:01:16,034 --> 01:01:18,027
Stand back, Inspector, or I'll shoot you.

1058
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,282
Drop that gun.

1059
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:20,699
All right, Jack.

1060
01:01:21,665 --> 01:01:24,666
Don't be a fool. This is only going
to make it worse for you.

1061
01:01:24,751 --> 01:01:28,036
Stand back, Inspector.
Let me out of here or I'll shoot you.

1062
01:01:31,508 --> 01:01:33,002
Let me see it!

1063
01:01:33,676 --> 01:01:35,965
It's only his finger. Get me a towel.

1064
01:01:36,887 --> 01:01:39,259
Now, take it easy, buddy.

1065
01:01:39,431 --> 01:01:41,223
All we want to do is talk to you.

1066
01:01:51,067 --> 01:01:52,562
You can't do a thing?

1067
01:01:54,403 --> 01:01:56,313
You're up to your neck?

1068
01:01:58,408 --> 01:01:59,736
All right.

1069
01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:09,036
You were right, Mr Dickson.

1070
01:02:09,127 --> 01:02:11,583
Brown didn't have anything to do it.
Here's your man.

1071
01:02:11,672 --> 01:02:13,913
You must be crazy.
I've known this man for years.

1072
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:17,340
He's just confessed. He's mixed up
with the toughest gangsters in town.

1073
01:02:17,427 --> 01:02:19,751
Confessed? Heavens' name!
What's got into you?

1074
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:22,086
I don't know.
It's all been like a crazy nightmare.

1075
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:25,098
You're not a thief. How did you get
mixed up with these people?

1076
01:02:25,184 --> 01:02:27,426
Gambling. I owed them a lot of money.

1077
01:02:27,603 --> 01:02:30,308
- Last week I lost over $50,000.
- $50,000.

1078
01:02:30,397 --> 01:02:32,805
But I didn't kill that man last night.
Honest I didn't.

1079
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,393
Yesterday they came to collect it.

1080
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:37,853
I begged them to wait. I wanted time
to think, but they wouldn't listen.

1081
01:02:37,946 --> 01:02:42,488
They threatened to kill me if I didn't pay.
I was desperate. I didn't know what to do.

1082
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:44,568
Then they suggested
I help them rob the bank.

1083
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:47,366
All I had to was turn off the alarm
and fix the time clock.

1084
01:02:47,455 --> 01:02:49,910
It all sounded so easy.
It seemed like a way out.

1085
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,956
I didn't know anybody
was going to be killed.

1086
01:02:52,043 --> 01:02:53,703
Why were you at Finlay's this morning?

1087
01:02:53,795 --> 01:02:55,455
I went to there to get my keys back.

1088
01:02:55,547 --> 01:02:58,037
Why didn't you come to me?
I'd have helped you out.

1089
01:02:58,132 --> 01:03:00,208
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr Dickson.

1090
01:03:00,301 --> 01:03:03,053
I didn't know what I was doing.
I wandered around in a daze.

1091
01:03:03,137 --> 01:03:06,304
All I could think of
was that they were going to kill me.

1092
01:03:06,389 --> 01:03:09,556
But you'll stand by me,
won't you, Mr Dickson?

1093
01:03:09,643 --> 01:03:13,475
You won't go back on me now, will you?
I'll die if they send me to prison.

1094
01:03:13,564 --> 01:03:15,639
Don't forget
there's a dead watchman downstairs.

1095
01:03:15,732 --> 01:03:19,266
I didn't kill him. I was home
in my apartment last night, I can prove it.

1096
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,895
Claims he was there with a married woman.
Doesn't want to mention her name.

1097
01:03:22,989 --> 01:03:25,195
He won't believe me,
but it's the truth, honest.

1098
01:03:25,282 --> 01:03:28,118
I was in my apartment last night.
Ask your wife. She...

1099
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:30,615
My wife?

1100
01:03:31,789 --> 01:03:33,995
What's she got to do with you?

1101
01:03:36,168 --> 01:03:38,706
No wonder he didn't want
to mention her name.

1102
01:03:41,299 --> 01:03:43,421
What was my wife doing in your apartment?

1103
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:46,593
Nothing, Mr Dickson.
Don't pay attention to me. I don't know...

1104
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:50,343
You just mentioned her name.
What was she doing in your apartment?

1105
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:53,096
Well, she just came up for a drink.

1106
01:03:53,184 --> 01:03:55,011
- Just for a few...
- You're lying!

1107
01:03:55,103 --> 01:03:58,307
Don't worry, Mr Dickson.
We'll find out if he's telling the truth.

1108
01:03:58,398 --> 01:04:00,307
We'll have a man check up on it right away.

1109
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,850
No one check up on anybody.
I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.

1110
01:04:04,528 --> 01:04:05,773
<i>- Helen.
- Sir?</i>

1111
01:04:05,863 --> 01:04:08,022
Get Mrs Dickson on the phone.

1112
01:04:21,044 --> 01:04:23,666
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something.

1113
01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:28,085
I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you,
but I want you to tell me the truth.

1114
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:30,840
Where were you last night?

1115
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,508
Last night?

1116
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,807
Why, last night...

1117
01:04:39,062 --> 01:04:42,063
Listen, dear.
Now, tell me the truth about this.

1118
01:04:43,733 --> 01:04:45,725
Were you in Cluet's apartment?

1119
01:04:45,818 --> 01:04:47,526
In Cluet's apartment?

1120
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:51,363
Well, dear, you see, I...

1121
01:04:57,663 --> 01:04:59,786
She wasn't to blame, Mr Dickson.

1122
01:05:00,082 --> 01:05:02,371
It wasn't her fault, honest it wasn't.

1123
01:05:02,585 --> 01:05:04,956
- I begged her to come up. She didn't...
- Get out!

1124
01:05:05,045 --> 01:05:06,753
All right. Let's go.

1125
01:05:15,138 --> 01:05:16,597
Clark, you're insane to wait.

1126
01:05:16,682 --> 01:05:18,590
Let's get some money here
and stop this run.

1127
01:05:18,683 --> 01:05:20,806
If we close,
our stock won't be worth a nickel.

1128
01:05:20,894 --> 01:05:23,929
- My dear friends...
- I'll lay you 10-to-1 Dickson won't give in.

1129
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:26,180
Maybe they're right, Clark.

1130
01:05:27,942 --> 01:05:30,777
All right. I'll go and have a talk with him.

1131
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:48,292
Dickson, I'd like to talk with you
about the bank.

1132
01:05:49,295 --> 01:05:51,869
The bank? All right,
do anything you want with it.

1133
01:05:51,965 --> 01:05:54,124
Now you're talking sense.

1134
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:58,714
We'll draw up an option on your stock.
Say $80 a share. How's that?

1135
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:02,223
Eighty dollars? That's fine.
Anything you say.

1136
01:06:02,476 --> 01:06:04,467
Good. I'll draw it up at once.

1137
01:06:10,983 --> 01:06:13,106
You want the rest of those numbers,
Mr Dickson?

1138
01:06:13,194 --> 01:06:14,569
Numbers?

1139
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:17,113
No, never mind.

1140
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:28,450
What's he doing? Is he getting any help?

1141
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,790
Something's happened.
He isn't trying any more.

1142
01:06:30,877 --> 01:06:32,158
They must've turned him down.

1143
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,877
He's called the biggest people in town.

1144
01:06:33,963 --> 01:06:37,961
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought
to have known that. I'll talk to him.

1145
01:06:38,176 --> 01:06:41,545
We haven't got much time.
We got to do something or it'll be too late.

1146
01:06:41,638 --> 01:06:44,342
- Where were you last night?
- You're not giving up, are you?

1147
01:06:44,432 --> 01:06:46,804
- Were you in Cluet's apartment?
- I'll explain later.

1148
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:49,099
You're losing your bank.
You know what that means?

1149
01:06:49,186 --> 01:06:51,392
- Was Mrs Dickson there?
- Don't let them lick you.

1150
01:06:51,479 --> 01:06:54,481
Even if some big shots turned you down,
you've got other friends.

1151
01:06:54,566 --> 01:06:56,358
Guys who are in business because of you.

1152
01:06:56,443 --> 01:06:58,151
- All you got to do is...
- Wait a minute.

1153
01:06:58,237 --> 01:07:01,570
Answer my question.
Was Mrs Dickson there?

1154
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:04,323
She was, wasn't she?

1155
01:07:04,617 --> 01:07:06,028
How long has this been going on?

1156
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:10,365
I don't know what you're talking about.
All I know is you're losing your bank...

1157
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:14,751
Please, Matt.

1158
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:24,844
- Did you talk to him?
- Yeah.

1159
01:07:25,889 --> 01:07:28,094
I got an idea. Come on.
Let's get to a telephone.

1160
01:07:50,578 --> 01:07:53,449
A 30-day option on 10,000 shares
of stock in this company,

1161
01:07:53,539 --> 01:07:55,662
now registered
in the name of Thomas A. Dickson.

1162
01:07:55,749 --> 01:07:58,419
Get that to me in triplicate
just as fast as you can.

1163
01:08:02,549 --> 01:08:05,335
There's no more money.
You'll have to go to the next window.

1164
01:08:05,426 --> 01:08:06,624
No more money?

1165
01:08:07,011 --> 01:08:08,754
What do you mean, there's no more money?

1166
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:11,254
Go to the next window. They'll pay you...

1167
01:08:18,522 --> 01:08:20,099
That's all there is.

1168
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:28,485
Are you sure he's in here?

1169
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:31,194
Yes, ma'am, he must be. He hasn't come out.

1170
01:08:38,749 --> 01:08:41,536
I've got to get in there.
Can't you find me a key?

1171
01:08:41,627 --> 01:08:44,747
Yes, I think there's one
right here in the drawer.

1172
01:08:55,933 --> 01:08:57,676
Tom, darling.

1173
01:08:58,518 --> 01:09:00,642
I came to explain about last night.

1174
01:09:01,313 --> 01:09:03,934
Cyril Cluett doesn't mean
anything to me, Tom.

1175
01:09:04,024 --> 01:09:07,143
I went out with him last night
simply because...

1176
01:09:07,234 --> 01:09:10,983
Well, I'd begun to feel
that I didn't have any part in your life,

1177
01:09:11,072 --> 01:09:12,697
that I was an outsider.

1178
01:09:13,825 --> 01:09:16,232
Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre

1179
01:09:16,327 --> 01:09:20,656
and then we went back to his apartment
afterwards for a drink. That's all it was.

1180
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:23,162
I didn't do anything wrong, Tom.

1181
01:09:23,501 --> 01:09:27,712
I couldn't do anything wrong.
I love you too much, you know that.

1182
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,208
Here, here.

1183
01:09:35,887 --> 01:09:39,506
Dickson's in a jam. The run's getting worse.
The big guys have the screws on.

1184
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,849
He came through for you 100 times.
If friends don't help him, who will?

1185
01:09:42,936 --> 01:09:43,967
There's Mr Jones!

1186
01:09:44,062 --> 01:09:47,431
Any bank that Tom Dickson has
anything to do with is all right.

1187
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:51,022
I'm putting my money in here.
Why should you be afraid?

1188
01:09:52,945 --> 01:09:55,187
Tom Dickson is all right.
He's perfectly square.

1189
01:09:55,281 --> 01:09:58,484
I'm putting my money in this bank.
I know what I'm doing.

1190
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:03,113
Open up. I want to put money in here.
I don't want to take any out.

1191
01:10:03,204 --> 01:10:04,699
Certainly, Mr Jones. Charlie!

1192
01:10:04,789 --> 01:10:07,245
They're starting to come in already.
Yeah. Listen.

1193
01:10:07,334 --> 01:10:10,370
Get all the money you can,
and bring it here. Step on it.

1194
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:11,956
- Who's this?
- Hello, Mr Dunkirk?

1195
01:10:12,047 --> 01:10:15,048
- Williams.
- Mr Williams... I'll speak to both of them.

1196
01:10:15,133 --> 01:10:19,131
Dickson's in a jam. The run's getting worse.
Those big guys got the screws on him.

1197
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:22,056
You two have to help him.
If friends don't help him, who will?

1198
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:25,058
He came through for you 100 times.
They're coming in already.

1199
01:10:25,143 --> 01:10:27,894
Get all the money you can
and bring it down here right away.

1200
01:10:27,979 --> 01:10:29,094
Both of you, step on it!

1201
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:31,858
If it's all right for me,
it's all right for everybody.

1202
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:41,065
I'm going to make a deposit.

1203
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,992
What's the matter with you?

1204
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:47,198
I want to make a deposit.
$4,600 for Rico Mazzetti.

1205
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:49,245
He's the best man in the world.

1206
01:10:55,254 --> 01:10:57,413
No matter what you think about me

1207
01:10:57,507 --> 01:11:00,627
there's something far more important:
those people down there.

1208
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,007
The bank, Tom, you can't give that up.

1209
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:06,255
Mr Dickson! Come here a minute.
Look at this.

1210
01:11:06,349 --> 01:11:09,136
Something wonderful has happened.
People are making deposits.

1211
01:11:09,227 --> 01:11:12,596
You won't believe it until you see it.
You've got to come out.

1212
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:24,065
Tom Dickson is a friend of mine.
I'll put money in his bank anytime.

1213
01:11:24,157 --> 01:11:26,399
Anybody who takes money
out of this bank is crazy.

1214
01:11:26,493 --> 01:11:29,364
I'm going to put a lot of money in here.

1215
01:11:37,962 --> 01:11:40,250
I've got some money to deposit.

1216
01:11:42,425 --> 01:11:44,963
I haven't got much, but here it is.

1217
01:11:45,386 --> 01:11:47,593
I'd give Tom Dickson all my money anytime!

1218
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:50,087
- Come out here and look at this.
- We've been waiting...

1219
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:52,389
You know what you can do with that.
Look at this,

1220
01:11:52,477 --> 01:11:55,893
a demonstration of faith worth more
than all the collateral in the world.

1221
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,640
Come on, it'll do your heart good.

1222
01:11:57,731 --> 01:12:00,519
They're shoving their hard-earned money
across the counter

1223
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,767
with a 10-to-1 chance against them.

1224
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:09,443
You want to stay with this bank,
get real money over here now.

1225
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:11,444
That's enough for me.
I'm ashamed of myself.

1226
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:13,494
I'll have $100,000 here in five minutes.

1227
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,122
- Now you're talking, Ames.
- I'm sold.

1228
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,365
- Schultz?
- This is your bank, and I'm with you.

1229
01:12:17,459 --> 01:12:18,572
- Ives?
- My dear friends,

1230
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,826
that's what I've been trying to say
all afternoon.

1231
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,837
Clark, you can do twice as much
as any of them. How about you?

1232
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:27,671
I don't agree with you, but if everyone
is going crazy, I'll go crazy, too.

1233
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,503
This is Ben Schultz.

1234
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,671
Send $100,000 cash
to the Union National now.

1235
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,803
Send all available cash
to the Union National.

1236
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,171
Currency. Small denominations.

1237
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,430
In 10s and 20s. Yeah.

1238
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,224
Say, I want $150,000 over here right away.

1239
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,765
I am in my right mind.

1240
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:44,557
No, not $150.

1241
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:49,280
Say, listen, you guys, $150,000!

1242
01:12:49,489 --> 01:12:50,652
Yes!

1243
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:39,402
That's the trouble with people nowadays.

1244
01:13:39,495 --> 01:13:42,331
They hear a crazy rumour,
and right away they lose their heads.

1245
01:13:42,415 --> 01:13:45,036
Not me. You didn't see me
draw my money out, did you?

1246
01:13:47,794 --> 01:13:49,123
Good morning.

1247
01:13:49,212 --> 01:13:52,297
Union National Bank. Just a minute.

1248
01:13:56,595 --> 01:13:58,469
9:00 and all is lousy.

1249
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:00,712
Where's Matt?

1250
01:14:00,808 --> 01:14:03,215
Ten-to-one he'll have a crack
about the run yesterday.

1251
01:14:03,309 --> 01:14:04,934
It's a cinch bet. I wouldn't take it.

1252
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:08,104
If he pulls a gag about the run,
we'll murder the guy.

1253
01:14:41,304 --> 01:14:44,139
I suppose you guys
had a good run for your money...

1254
01:14:46,977 --> 01:14:49,550
- Good morning, Mr Gardiner.
- Good morning.

1255
01:14:51,982 --> 01:14:55,351
Good morning, Mr Dickson.
My wife is much better this morning.

1256
01:14:55,444 --> 01:14:58,314
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right, too.

1257
01:14:58,822 --> 01:14:59,984
Carter!

1258
01:15:05,619 --> 01:15:08,075
- Morning, Mr Dickson.
- Morning.

1259
01:15:09,415 --> 01:15:11,657
- Well, got your uniform?
- Yes, sir.

1260
01:15:11,751 --> 01:15:14,076
Looks good. How much did it cost?

1261
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,660
I don't know. Mr Sampson bought it for me.

1262
01:15:17,297 --> 01:15:20,132
Well, I guess
I'll have to see Sampson myself.

1263
01:15:21,968 --> 01:15:23,841
- Good morning, Helen.
- Good morning.

1264
01:15:23,928 --> 01:15:25,837
Say, I know what's the matter with you.

1265
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,009
Matt!

1266
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:31,434
I want you both to take the day off.

1267
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,558
Go downtown, get a licence,
and get married.

1268
01:15:33,646 --> 01:15:35,354
- Well, I...
- I don't want to hear it.

1269
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,931
If you don't get married,
I'll fire the both of you.

1270
01:15:38,026 --> 01:15:40,861
Helen, while you're downtown,
stop in and make reservations

1271
01:15:40,946 --> 01:15:43,566
<i>for the bridal suite on the Berengaria,
sailing next week.</i>

1272
01:15:43,656 --> 01:15:46,907
- Gee, thanks...
- No. It's not for you.

1273
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:49,951
You're only going to get married.

1274
01:15:50,037 --> 01:15:53,203
Mrs Dickson and I
are going on the honeymoon.

1275
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,542
Come on, slave.
