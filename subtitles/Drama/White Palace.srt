3
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,960
Maxie, it's Neil.
Don't forget the burgers, pal.

4
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,389
Corner of Olive and 18th.
It'll be ready at 7:30.

5
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,570
Yee-hah!

6
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,164
Hello. It's your mother.

7
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:23,053
Don't forget tomorrow
we visit Janey.

8
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:25,605
You'll pick me up
at the store at 4:00.

9
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:27,556
Hello?

10
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:29,829
Hello?

11
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:33,157
All right!

12
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,760
Max!

13
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,588
Ha ha ha!

14
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:57,030
Max! Max is here!

15
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:59,104
White Palace burgers!

16
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:05,502
Hi. What are you drinking?

17
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,622
Soda.

18
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,735
It's a bachelor party.
I'm getting married.

19
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:12,354
Oh! Oh!

20
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,844
Hey, what about me?
I want one.

21
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:17,219
Aah!

22
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:24,513
Hey, Max, some of these boxes
are empty, man.

23
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:27,135
What?

24
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:30,908
Son of a bitch.
Look at this.

25
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:33,051
I got three... four of them.

26
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:35,456
How could they be empty?

27
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:36,602
What's that? Five?

28
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:40,186
I got six, six empty boxes.

29
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:41,947
Shit. I should've
counted them. Sorry.

30
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:44,853
Come on.
It's a 49-cent burger.

31
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:47,067
I'm going back.
You want burgers or money?

32
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,405
- Are you crazy?
- What's he talking about?

33
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,570
What's the matter with you?
We're having a party!

34
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:55,191
We've been crapped on, Neil.

35
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,888
What is the trouble?

36
00:04:56,926 --> 00:05:00,057
The trouble is you don't
give a damn about principle.

37
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,329
Are you kidding?
I'm a lawyer.

38
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,807
Hey! Hey! Hey!

39
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,929
- Excuse me.
- End of the line's over there.

40
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,815
- I'm not buying anything.
- Get in line, Fred.

41
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:39,603
Look inside the sack, please.

42
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,926
When it's your turn.
$2.35.

43
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,518
I don't think
I need to get in line.

44
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:46,899
I already was in line.

45
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:49,868
I bought 50 burgers.
You only gave me 44,

46
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,697
so I don't think
I have to wait.

47
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:54,220
- Is that so?
- That is so.

48
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,489
Look. Six empties.
I want my money back.

49
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,523
And how do I know you didn't
gobble up those burgers?

50
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:02,537
Because I don't gobble
and I don't lie.

51
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,717
You gave me six empty boxes.

52
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:07,536
I bought 50 burgers.
You gave me 44.

53
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,918
Do I get my money back
or go to the manager?

54
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,504
Smell the boxes. Here.

55
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:15,853
If there had been
White Palaces inside,

56
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,350
the boxes would stink,
wouldn't they?

57
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:19,116
Honey, my nose is so full
of White Palaces,

58
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:21,607
I couldn't smell one
shoved in my face.

59
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,266
Yo, buddy, I'd like
to get my hamburgers.

60
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:26,026
Will you leave
Mr. Astaire alone?

61
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,331
He's trying to report
a robbery here.

62
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,110
Thank you.

63
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:48,456
Next.

64
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,978
Whoa!

65
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:53,833
Are you Jewish?
I'm just guessing.

66
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:56,866
Hey! It's Honest Abe!

67
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:58,662
I got the money back, Neil.

68
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:01,599
You'll need it for therapy.
You're a nutcase.

69
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,648
Ladies and gentlemen,

70
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,313
may I introduce...

71
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:08,996
the future Mrs. Neil Horowitz?

72
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:11,137
Yay!

73
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:12,069
Ow!

74
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:15,037
Damn. She is fat.

75
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,144
She is always
going to be fat,

76
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:20,450
but she's
a very sweet woman.

77
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:24,096
Oh! Max, look.

78
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,660
It's you.

79
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:29,279
Hey, Max with the fiddle.
You were good, man.

80
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,494
You were good.

81
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:31,742
Max!

82
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,306
It's the fiddler.

83
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:35,038
Oh, Stravinsky.

84
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,285
What's next?

85
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,225
Who is that?

86
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,371
Is that Margie Brown?

87
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:43,036
No. It's Janey.

88
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,628
Look how young she is.

89
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,425
When did you start going out
with her? Kindergarten?

90
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,943
Something like that. Yeah.

91
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,219
She was beautiful.

92
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,574
Klugman, what else you got
back there, huh?

93
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:04,727
Larry.

94
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:06,715
Come on. Come on!

95
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,538
It's stuck.
Give me a second.

96
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,684
Could somebody flip
the light switch?

97
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:20,824
Max, have
another scotch, buddy.

98
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:24,376
Let's see.
Who wants another one?

99
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:35,986
You're turning into the crazy
old woman from Dickens,

100
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:37,913
the one who sits around
in her wedding dress

101
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,352
cherishing
her fucking grief.

102
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:40,464
Havisham.

103
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,359
Yeah. That's who
you're turning into.

104
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:44,302
When's the last time
you had a date?

105
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:47,343
What if I told you...

106
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:50,133
I wasn't interested
in getting laid right now?

107
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,588
Interest in getting laid
is the human condition,

108
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,932
for Christ's sakes, Max.

109
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:56,624
It's all around you.

110
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,774
Heidi Solomon.

111
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:58,893
Oh, please.

112
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:01,715
She salivates
over you every day.

113
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:03,985
Rita Fishman... she's gorgeous.

114
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,296
She would sleep...

115
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:06,706
If I choose
to be celibate,

116
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,977
that's not your business.

117
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:11,402
This isn't celibacy
we're talking about.

118
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:13,231
It's fucking necrophilia.

119
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,251
Good night, Neil.

120
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,636
- Great party.
- Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Max.

121
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:24,974
You're feeling sorry
for yourself.

122
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:27,462
Makes me want to puke!

123
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,130
Blah-ha hah!

124
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,761
Whoa ho!

125
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,367
Ha ha ha!

126
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:12,735
Ha ha ha!

127
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:25,731
Wait a minute.

128
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:30,625
Aah! Ha ha!

129
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,226
What would it take

130
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:38,530
to make you mine?

131
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:41,183
Ivory towers of wine

132
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,067
A rugged movie star
that looks so fine?

133
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,593
You know they're really
hard to find

134
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:49,377
What would it take
to make you mine?

135
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:52,028
I'd stay home all the time

136
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,717
Give you everything that's mine

137
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,411
Even though I'm paying on time

138
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,392
What would it take

139
00:10:58,434 --> 00:10:59,862
To make

140
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:01,727
You mine?

141
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,255
Chivas and a splash.

142
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,368
...to make you mine?

143
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:08,059
A condo in a sunny clime

144
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:10,778
Compatible astrology signs

145
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:12,408
Or sitting round gettin' high?

146
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:16,091
What would it take
to make you mine?

147
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,809
Champagne breakfast at 9:00

148
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,366
Pumped up all of the time

149
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:22,998
Or simply just sayin' that I'd

150
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:25,012
Like to make you mine

151
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:26,297
All mine

152
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,601
All mine?

153
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,512
Some coincidence, huh?

154
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,034
What?

155
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:48,755
I'll give you a hint, Fred.

156
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:51,029
I ain't exactly Ginger Rogers.

157
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,519
Oh, no.

158
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:56,919
Oh, no, huh?

159
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,293
Yeah.

160
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:01,142
Oh, no, what? Huh?

161
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,997
I don't know.
Just oh, no.

162
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:08,245
What are you doing
in a dump like this?

163
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,936
You looking for trouble?

164
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,590
I'm having a drink.

165
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,958
Cigarette?

166
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:21,778
No, thank you.

167
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:23,786
I know, I know.
Smoking will kill me.

168
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:24,907
That's right.

169
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,921
Mmm. Well, come on.
Lecture me.

170
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,555
I love it. Come on.

171
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:29,903
I don't lecture.

172
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:31,628
Fred, I bet
you lecture everybody.

173
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,907
Yeah? Not tonight.

174
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:35,760
Good. How about another drink?
Jimmy, vodka tonic and...

175
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:38,181
- I don't want another drink.
- Scotch for my new friend here.

176
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,631
- What's your name?
- I don't want another drink.

177
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:42,250
Come on.
Let me buy you a drink.

178
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:45,735
Let's pass a peace pipe.
Come on. Huh?

179
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:51,108
I'm buying.

180
00:12:58,158 --> 00:13:00,361
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- No, no. I got...

181
00:13:00,397 --> 00:13:02,982
- I'm paying for it.
- I don't want you to.

182
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,565
- I am buying you a drink.
- Here. For both of them.

183
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:08,610
Please. All right. OK.

184
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,721
Look at you.
You're so cute.

185
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:14,407
You're all tensed up
like a ticklish little kid.

186
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:17,758
Damn. You are beautiful.
Look at that face.

187
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:19,493
Jimmy, is this
a beautiful face?

188
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:25,446
Anybody ever tell you
you look like Tony Curtis?

189
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:30,081
- All the time.
- Ha ha!

190
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:34,534
Hmm...

191
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,934
I had a wonderful dream.

192
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:40,381
I was sorting your shells
and mixing your cocktails.

193
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:43,324
When I woke up, I wanted to
swim right back to you.

194
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:53,278
"Some Like It Hot. "
Did you ever see it?

195
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,226
- It's not a tough question.
- No, no.

196
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,536
- Marilyn Monroe.
- Yeah, I saw that.

197
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,157
God, she's something. Mmm.

198
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,537
Yeah. She is.

199
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:05,280
You swim?

200
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:07,545
Do I swim?

201
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,211
Yeah. You look like you swim.

202
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,809
I mean, you're not
real muscular,

203
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,784
but you're strong,
am I right?

204
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:20,923
I think you're drunk.

205
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,440
Yeah. If I get any drunker,
I'll fall all over you.

206
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,022
So...

207
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:45,172
What's with the monkey suit?
You a chauffeur?

208
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:47,797
Oh, no.
I was at a bachelor party.

209
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,428
Yours?

210
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:50,611
No.

211
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:54,329
Did you have a naked girl?

212
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:55,605
A dozen of them.

213
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:58,388
You got a wife?

214
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,045
Uh-uh.

215
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:02,193
No, I don't.

216
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:04,402
You're not sure?

217
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:07,278
I don't have a wife.

218
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,686
But you did
have one, right?

219
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:13,840
Yeah, that's r... yeah.
That's correct.

220
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,977
She leave you?
Is that how come you're so sad?

221
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:18,323
I'm not sad.

222
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:20,845
You're feeling
sorry for yourself.

223
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,850
Do you mind if we
change the subject?

224
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:31,888
Hi, Tony.

225
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:35,151
Hi, Fred.

226
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:38,027
Come on.

227
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:40,560
Tell me your name.

228
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,312
Mine's Nora.

229
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:46,601
Max.

230
00:15:46,642 --> 00:15:48,551
Oh, that's cute.

231
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:51,375
What's your zip code? Hmm?

232
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,157
What kind of soap does
your wife use?

233
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,869
Maybe you should take
your hand off my thigh.

234
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,615
My hand's not on your thigh.

235
00:16:34,665 --> 00:16:35,810
Night.

236
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:40,545
Sorry about your lady
dumping you.

237
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:47,907
- She didn't exactly dump me.
- What did she do, then?

238
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:49,219
She died.

239
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,222
Died?

240
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:55,807
You mean died?

241
00:16:57,862 --> 00:16:58,974
Yeah.

242
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:03,615
That's a new one.

243
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,722
How did she do that?

244
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:09,566
Car turned over.

245
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:11,992
Ha ha ha!

246
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,577
Oh, I'm s...

247
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:23,358
I'm sorry. I just...
I can't help it.

248
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:25,083
That's all right.

249
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:26,681
I don't know
why I'm laughing.

250
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,378
Your wife died.

251
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,107
Maybe nobody ever
died on you before.

252
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:32,893
No. Charlie died.

253
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,229
Charlie? What?
Is that your doggie?

254
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,343
No.

255
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:38,008
Charlie... my kid.

256
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:43,927
Your kid?

257
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,099
I know, I know. I know.

258
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:49,847
How'd he die?

259
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,124
Leukemia.

260
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,936
What can you do?

261
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:07,800
The worid spins around.

262
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:12,050
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:18,831
It's over...

264
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:19,951
right?

265
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,378
Right.

266
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:30,003
Good night.

267
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,069
This good-hearted woman

268
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:40,425
She loves her good-timin' man

269
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:02,126
Drive me home.
I'll fix you a cup of coffee.

270
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,582
Actually, I missed the bus.

271
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:07,406
I don't live too far from here.

272
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,123
Come on. You don't
want me to take a taxi.

273
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:16,109
- Don't smoke in the car, OK?
- Deal.

274
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,771
Put your seat belt on.

275
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:31,621
It's all right. Hold on.

276
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:46,913
You're a cautious little doggie.

277
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,136
What's that?

278
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,808
That is the most beautiful music
in the worid.

279
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,274
You got any Oak Ridge Boys?

280
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,455
No. I'm afraid not.

281
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:27,296
What are you?
Are you Italian or something?

282
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,086
I'm Jewish.

283
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:30,332
Jewish?

284
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,831
Ha!

285
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,464
Interesting people... Jews.

286
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,907
I was Catholic myself once,
but confessión made me jumpy.

287
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:40,056
Ha!

288
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,822
I tried them all, but I never
did try to find Moses.

289
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:48,790
Tell you the truth,
I don't know very many Jews.

290
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,416
This guy tried to shove
Brigham Young on my ass once.

291
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:52,883
Go left at Clayton.

292
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:55,195
That's... well,
that's Dogtown.

293
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,164
That's what they call it.
Go left here.

294
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:00,212
Turn... turn left!

295
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,696
- You're drunk.
- I'm all right.

296
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,161
No. You're drunk.

297
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:08,059
- OK. Turn again.
- Where?

298
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:09,400
Right here!

299
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:11,856
God!

300
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,920
Ha ha ha!

301
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:17,272
I love him.

302
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,369
That's a drunk
driving the drunk.

303
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,870
I just can't...

304
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:32,529
ha ha ha!

305
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:50,769
Ha ha ha!

306
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,292
Ha ha ha!

307
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:00,810
Come on, beautiful.

308
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,639
Let me fix you some coffee.

309
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:05,674
You're too drunk to drive.

310
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:08,016
- I'm all right.
- No. Come on.

311
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,162
Come on.

312
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:12,493
Ha ha ha! Ohhh.

313
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:14,154
Don't slip on the Astroturf.

314
00:22:14,193 --> 00:22:15,599
Ha ha ha!

315
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:35,332
Make yourself at home.

316
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:56,103
What exactly is there
between you and Marilyn Monroe?

317
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:59,204
Oh, she's just
so fucked up and glamorous...

318
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:03,201
and losing and fighting
all the time, you know?

319
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,127
I seen all her movies
at least five times,

320
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,428
and also my name is Nora Baker,

321
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:10,529
and her real name
is Norma Jean Baker.

322
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:11,777
Get it?

323
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:15,071
How about that coffee?

324
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,335
How about it?

325
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:24,899
Could have sworn I had me
a full can of Maxwell House.

326
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,875
There's no coffee?

327
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:29,021
Why don't I fix you
a drink instead?

328
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,172
A drink?

329
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:33,343
No. I'm trying to get my ass
home in one piece.

330
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,866
If you can't drive,
you might as well drink, right?

331
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:41,404
How can you be out of coffee?

332
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:43,711
This couch opens up into a bed.

333
00:23:43,745 --> 00:23:45,982
- I'm not staying here.
- I'll wake you up early.

334
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:49,148
No. I'm not going to sleep here.

335
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:51,356
What do you want to do?

336
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:54,262
You want to call a taxi
and come back in the morning?

337
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:07,869
Do you have a bathroom?

338
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:54,096
Hi.

339
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:58,062
I don't feel very well.

340
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:01,810
I think I might just
lie down for a moment.

341
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:04,494
Poor baby.

342
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:55,846
Janey.

343
00:25:57,996 --> 00:25:59,653
You're so beautiful.

344
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:18,894
More?

345
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,340
Yes.

346
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,861
Say please.

347
00:28:32,082 --> 00:28:33,358
Please.

348
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:43,885
Find anything interesting?

349
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:47,943
I hope you had a good time.

350
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:49,327
You needed it.

351
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:52,549
Will I see you again?

352
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:55,307
No.

353
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,704
For a minute there,
I really did think...

354
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:04,425
you were just going
to up and surprise me.

355
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:45,445
Hello, Max.
This is your mother.

356
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:51,586
Hey, partner,
sorry about the lecture.

357
00:32:51,622 --> 00:32:54,469
I was way out of line.
Where the hell are you?

358
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:57,349
You didn't jump
off a bridge, did you?

359
00:32:57,381 --> 00:33:00,228
Call me. I promise not to
make you screw anybody.

360
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:01,602
Ha ha ha!

361
00:33:03,652 --> 00:33:05,823
Hello, Max.
It's Heidi Solomon.

362
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,226
I'm taking a chance here,
but, uh...

363
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,431
I've got an extra ticket
to the symphony tonight.

364
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:12,092
It's all Schumann,

365
00:33:12,131 --> 00:33:13,919
and I'd love for you
to join me if you're free.

366
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:15,449
So why don't you give me a call?

367
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:18,807
919-1044. Bye-bye.

368
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:05,688
They're supposed
to pull the leaves off.

369
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,794
It's in the contract.

370
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,524
Don't you tell them?

371
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,561
No.

372
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:14,007
You have to scream at them,

373
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,855
or they don't
pull the leaves off.

374
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,578
What are you doing?

375
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:20,110
Mother, I'll tell them.

376
00:34:38,004 --> 00:34:39,946
Go ahead.
Put the stone on.

377
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,790
Two years.

378
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,338
It seems like yesterday.

379
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,339
Please.

380
00:35:03,376 --> 00:35:05,678
I'm going to go see Uncle Harry.

381
00:36:03,815 --> 00:36:05,025
See you!

382
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,357
It's over!

383
00:36:49,183 --> 00:36:50,328
Hello.

384
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,816
Well, I'll be.

385
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:56,792
I never thought
I'd see you again.

386
00:36:57,918 --> 00:37:00,568
I, uh... I came
to replace your mailbox.

387
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:04,378
I pro... I should have
called first. I'm sorry.

388
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,176
I don't want to bother you.

389
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:10,771
I just was...

390
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:16,725
I'm 43.

391
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:18,617
I'll be 44 in December.

392
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:22,990
I'm 27.

393
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:38,838
Ha ha ha!

394
00:37:54,644 --> 00:37:56,586
Women peak at 40

395
00:37:56,628 --> 00:37:58,450
And men at 19

396
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:03,821
I 'member laughing my head off

397
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:06,313
When I read that in a magazine

398
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:08,044
I was 20 at the time

399
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:10,220
Now I'm starin' 40

400
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:12,428
Right in the face

401
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:16,300
And the only tough part of being

402
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,513
A woman my age

403
00:38:17,552 --> 00:38:19,973
Is a man my age

404
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,046
That's why younger men are

405
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:25,869
Startin' to catch my eye

406
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:29,481
I'm startin'
to stop what I'm doin'

407
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:32,833
Just to turn around
and watch 'em walk by

408
00:38:34,797 --> 00:38:37,993
At the very next opportunity

409
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:41,257
I'm gonna give
a younger man a try

410
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:43,528
Oh, 'cause younger men

411
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:45,952
Are startin' to catch my eye

412
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:47,489
It's a classical station.

413
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:50,596
Oh. I'm sorry.

414
00:38:50,634 --> 00:38:52,292
I'm sorry.

415
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,540
For Christ's sakes.

416
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:54,690
I'm sorry.

417
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:57,856
Some of 'em drink too much

418
00:38:57,898 --> 00:39:00,614
A whole lot of 'em are married

419
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:03,872
And, honey, here am I

420
00:39:03,913 --> 00:39:06,978
On the threshold of all that fun

421
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,434
Oh, 'cause younger men

422
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:13,438
Are startin' to catch my eye

423
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:17,438
Yes, I said younger men

424
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:24,001
Are startin' to catch my eye

425
00:39:30,756 --> 00:39:32,064
Why'd you shut the door?

426
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,369
When my best young workaholic
starts dragging himself in...

427
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:35,996
an hour late every morning,

428
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:38,107
90 minutes late
from lunch today,

429
00:39:38,147 --> 00:39:40,350
I need to know what it means.

430
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:41,531
Though I love and cherish you...

431
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,155
as I do few members
of your loathsome sex...

432
00:39:44,193 --> 00:39:46,080
My personal life
is my business.

433
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:49,374
Everyone around here
takes long lunch breaks.

434
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:52,539
Oh, Lord.

435
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,837
I'm getting so stupid
in my old age.

436
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:58,140
- Who is she?
- You wouldn't know her.

437
00:39:58,175 --> 00:40:00,247
Don't be so sure.
It's a tiny worid.

438
00:40:00,287 --> 00:40:01,497
What's her name?

439
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:03,193
Marilyn Monroe.

440
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,539
Anything like Janey?

441
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,252
What if I don't answer that?

442
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:09,747
She's 23.

443
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,961
Out of where?
University of Wisconsin.

444
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:13,273
Full of pep,
clean as a whistle,

445
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:15,610
drives a white
Ford Mustang convertible,

446
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:16,724
runs a tidy ship.

447
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:18,357
You got it.

448
00:40:18,396 --> 00:40:20,468
Ain't life grand suddenly?

449
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:23,376
That's what I count on
in life... surprises.

450
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:26,615
Just when things seem
ordinary or downright hopeless,

451
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:30,163
along comes that unexpected
opportunity. Right?

452
00:40:30,202 --> 00:40:31,479
Maybe.

453
00:40:33,786 --> 00:40:35,127
What are you getting at?

454
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:38,543
I'm giving you
the Fidelity Savings account.

455
00:40:38,585 --> 00:40:41,618
I'll be senior copywriter,
but you'll do the work.

456
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:43,827
- Do you want it?
- Of course I do.

457
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:46,678
One minute you're selling ham,
the next, you're pushing money.

458
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,140
But screw on your own time.

459
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:50,485
Fidelity Savings is big leagues.

460
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:55,923
What is it?
Tell me. Tell me.

461
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,419
Open it. Open it.

462
00:41:17,938 --> 00:41:19,978
You brought me
cleaning equipment.

463
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:25,094
I didn't bring you Brillo.
It's a Dustbuster.

464
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:26,925
You bring me flowers
or Jell-O,

465
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,847
but don't bring me
cleaning equipment.

466
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,992
You're overreacting.

467
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:31,526
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

468
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:36,525
Yeah. You have Ring Dings
under your furniture.

469
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,282
I don't care what's
under my furniture.

470
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:39,747
This is where I live.

471
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,245
You don't like
my Ring Dings, tough shit.

472
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:45,450
All right, so if I bring you
perfumes and soap...

473
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:46,729
That's not the same.

474
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:49,612
You bring me that stuff
because you care about me.

475
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:53,281
Or something. You're bringing
this son of a bitch...

476
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:54,731
because you think
my house is dirty.

477
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:57,797
Your house IS dirty.
Look at how you keep it.

478
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,802
Look at your hallway.
Look at your kitchen.

479
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,297
You look at my kitchen.

480
00:42:03,338 --> 00:42:05,313
Sometimes it isn't so easy
to look at your kitchen.

481
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:06,728
Well, try.

482
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:09,664
This is so...

483
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:11,167
look at all this shit.

484
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,110
Take this little
motherfucker home.

485
00:42:34,149 --> 00:42:35,458
I don't want it here.

486
00:42:42,404 --> 00:42:44,411
- Nora...
- Take it home!

487
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:57,978
I'm sorry.

488
00:43:21,629 --> 00:43:24,182
I never had a man
fix me dinner before.

489
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:51,219
You make me feel beautiful.

490
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:28,303
You're so sweet.

491
00:45:01,837 --> 00:45:03,779
We decided we were
going to go to Disneyland.

492
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,642
It's a safe date, you know?
So I see her...

493
00:45:05,676 --> 00:45:07,269
Next Saturday night...
Yeah?

494
00:45:07,307 --> 00:45:09,478
I told my mother I'd help her
with her finances.

495
00:45:09,516 --> 00:45:10,977
I do it a couple times a year.

496
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:14,085
After she's finished work,
I promised I'd pick her up.

497
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:15,944
That's a nice thing,
balancing the books.

498
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,473
I said I'd pick her up
after work.

499
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,691
I know. I heard you.

500
00:45:21,257 --> 00:45:22,817
So, are you working
Saturday night?

501
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:23,969
Uh-huh.

502
00:45:28,424 --> 00:45:29,950
You antsy or something?

503
00:45:29,992 --> 00:45:32,675
No. I just don't feel
like watching TV.

504
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:34,816
- I don't make you watch TV.
- I never said you did.

505
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:37,091
- You seem to like it.
- Sometimes I do.

506
00:45:38,247 --> 00:45:39,807
- Is something bothering you?
- No.

507
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:42,304
Suddenly you don't like TV.

508
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:46,848
I think we should have some
other subjects to talk about.

509
00:45:46,885 --> 00:45:48,292
What's wrong with our subjects?

510
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:51,226
Nothing. I'm just saying
we should talk more...

511
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:53,570
instead of sitting around
watching TV all night.

512
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:00,890
- What would Janey talk about?
- It's not about Janey.

513
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:03,713
All right. If you want
to talk, let's talk.

514
00:46:03,746 --> 00:46:04,859
Uh...

515
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:08,761
Marcia's fooling around
with Marvin.

516
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:10,711
He's the night manager.

517
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:12,443
I'm going to slug him
one of these days...

518
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:15,677
if he doesn't keep his
cottonpicking hands to himself.

519
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:19,672
- Is that what you mean?
- No, it's not what I mean.

520
00:46:19,712 --> 00:46:23,006
Well, if you want to talk
about geography or the Greeks,

521
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,078
I don't know dick
about the Greeks.

522
00:46:27,038 --> 00:46:28,565
What's up? You want out?

523
00:46:28,606 --> 00:46:29,980
Out?

524
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,884
What are you talking about?

525
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:38,774
We're different, OK?

526
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,521
I'm sorry.

527
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:45,043
- Lf you want to go, go.
- I don't want to go.

528
00:46:45,084 --> 00:46:46,993
I don't understand you.
You're acting strange.

529
00:46:47,035 --> 00:46:50,580
- Maybe you should go home.
- I don't want to go home.

530
00:46:55,642 --> 00:46:56,787
I'm sorry.

531
00:46:56,825 --> 00:46:58,799
Will you stop being sorry
all the time?

532
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:00,596
I'm sorry that I'm sorry.
I just...

533
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:06,005
- What's bugging you anyway?
- You're the one that's antsy.

534
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,862
Something's bothering you.

535
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:09,870
That's how
this whole thing started.

536
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,735
My nails are wet.

537
00:47:38,227 --> 00:47:40,114
My nails are all wet.

538
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,666
Mazel tov!

539
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,677
- Saunter me over there.
- What are you talking about?

540
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,605
- I want to get them together.
- Who?

541
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:09,637
- Max and Rita.
- Max and Rita? I don't think so.

542
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:12,906
Let me try. Come on.
Saunter me over there.

543
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:15,046
This isn't sauntering.
This is pulling.

544
00:48:16,108 --> 00:48:19,653
Max, there's somebody here
who's dying to meet you.

545
00:48:19,692 --> 00:48:21,218
Rita Fishman.

546
00:48:22,507 --> 00:48:24,962
She's single,
and she just caught my bouquet.

547
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:26,464
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

548
00:48:26,506 --> 00:48:27,968
All these weeks
we've tried to find out...

549
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,254
where he's been hiding...

550
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,362
- Yeah?
- He's been seeing somebody.

551
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:34,151
- Why didn't you bring her?
- She was busy.

552
00:48:34,185 --> 00:48:36,290
Spill the dirt.
She's a rich client, right?

553
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:38,401
We embarrass you, right?

554
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:40,131
When we get back
from St. Bart's,

555
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,543
we are having Thanksgiving.

556
00:48:41,576 --> 00:48:42,983
You're coming, Max,

557
00:48:43,015 --> 00:48:44,902
and you're bringing
your lady friend.

558
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:46,145
- Well, we'll see.
- Yes, you are.

559
00:48:46,184 --> 00:48:49,216
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

560
00:49:02,308 --> 00:49:03,323
Nora?

561
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:14,588
Nora?

562
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:26,173
Nora?

563
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:30,812
Nora?

564
00:49:34,015 --> 00:49:35,608
What are you doing out there?

565
00:49:36,095 --> 00:49:38,299
- Electricity's out.
- How come?

566
00:49:38,334 --> 00:49:40,374
Because I didn't pay my bill.

567
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,934
Poor people are a hoot,
aren't they?

568
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:45,013
Why didn't you say something?
I could've written you a check.

569
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:46,776
Because I don't want
your charity.

570
00:49:46,813 --> 00:49:48,405
I'm doing just fine.

571
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:52,401
What's the matter with you?

572
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,015
Why don't you take
that pretty bouquet...

573
00:49:57,052 --> 00:49:58,644
and put it in some water?

574
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:03,123
OK.

575
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,642
Did you have a nice time
at the wedding?

576
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:12,886
Shit.

577
00:50:14,648 --> 00:50:17,495
They turned it out
when I was at work,

578
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:19,894
so I had to sit in the dark
when I come home.

579
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:21,171
I'm afraid of the dark.

580
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:23,924
Maybe I forgot to tell you
how I'm afraid of the dark.

581
00:50:26,486 --> 00:50:29,039
So I called information
and got your mother's number.

582
00:50:31,286 --> 00:50:32,714
And surprise.

583
00:50:34,485 --> 00:50:38,227
I told her I was a friend
of yours... in the dark.

584
00:50:38,964 --> 00:50:41,681
Didn't even get to watch
"Some Like It Hot" on TV.

585
00:50:42,324 --> 00:50:46,153
Your mom says she likes Marilyn,
but she thinks she was murdered.

586
00:50:46,803 --> 00:50:48,396
I'm sorry.

587
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:49,679
Yeah, you're always sorry.

588
00:50:53,362 --> 00:50:57,038
So... who'd you bring
to this shindig?

589
00:50:57,074 --> 00:50:58,764
Some fresh young thing
with a tight little ass...

590
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:00,361
and a college education?

591
00:51:00,401 --> 00:51:01,513
No.

592
00:51:01,553 --> 00:51:03,407
Bet you I got
one thing up on her.

593
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:05,807
Bet she can't hold a candle
to me in the fucking department.

594
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,919
That's enough.

595
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,105
I might be a dumb Hoosier,

596
00:51:08,143 --> 00:51:10,444
but that's one thing I know
how to do, don't I, baby?

597
00:51:10,479 --> 00:51:12,388
And I'll say when it's enough.

598
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:15,081
There's no other woman.

599
00:51:15,118 --> 00:51:16,230
Bullshit.

600
00:51:17,997 --> 00:51:20,201
I wish there was,
but there isn't.

601
00:51:20,237 --> 00:51:22,441
I can't look at another woman
without wanting you.

602
00:51:22,477 --> 00:51:24,037
I'm afraid you're going to
have to do better than that.

603
00:51:24,077 --> 00:51:26,116
Nora, I don't know...
Why did you lie to me?!

604
00:51:26,157 --> 00:51:27,400
I don't know
what's happening to me.

605
00:51:27,437 --> 00:51:29,957
I have never wanted a woman
as much as I wanted you,

606
00:51:29,996 --> 00:51:31,556
never, not even my wife.

607
00:51:31,595 --> 00:51:33,002
You better be careful
with words like that.

608
00:51:33,036 --> 00:51:34,442
Words like that could kill
a person if you don't mean it.

609
00:51:34,475 --> 00:51:35,555
Well, I mean it.

610
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:37,155
That you love me more
than you do your wife?

611
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,274
I didn't say that.

612
00:51:38,314 --> 00:51:40,769
I said I wanted you
more than my wife.

613
00:51:42,634 --> 00:51:44,063
What's the difference?

614
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:47,586
I don't know.

615
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:52,549
I don't know.

616
00:51:55,272 --> 00:51:56,832
I only know that
when I'm not with you,

617
00:51:56,871 --> 00:51:58,758
I'm a total wreck.

618
00:51:58,791 --> 00:51:59,871
And when you are with me?

619
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:02,431
I'm a different kind
of total wreck.

620
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,674
Why did you lie to me?

621
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:06,750
Have you ever been
to a Jewish wedding?

622
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,968
Not recently.

623
00:52:08,006 --> 00:52:09,794
It wouldn't
have been that easy.

624
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:11,716
I wanted to save us
a cross-examination.

625
00:52:11,748 --> 00:52:13,025
Oh, bullshit.

626
00:52:15,588 --> 00:52:17,475
You were embarrassed
to take me there, weren't you?

627
00:52:17,507 --> 00:52:18,914
Nora, that's not true.

628
00:52:19,747 --> 00:52:22,430
There's nothing I hate
more than being lied to.

629
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:24,027
I'd rather have a man
beat me up.

630
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:26,784
At least then you stand
a chance of defending yourself.

631
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:52,056
You know, every time
we have a date...

632
00:52:52,862 --> 00:52:54,618
and you show up on time...

633
00:52:55,262 --> 00:52:58,130
I'm so damn grateful,
it's downright sickening.

634
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:00,690
Because I don't expect you
to show up at all.

635
00:53:01,341 --> 00:53:02,453
But you do.

636
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,548
And every time you do,
I just can't believe it.

637
00:53:07,419 --> 00:53:11,096
And I'm so damn happy
because...

638
00:53:13,178 --> 00:53:16,047
because I'm thinking maybe
you'll stick around a while.

639
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:20,337
And I'm believing in you.

640
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:22,744
Because you told me
the first time that I met you...

641
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:24,020
that you didn't gobble
and you didn't lie.

642
00:53:24,057 --> 00:53:25,617
I don't give a shit
if you gobble,

643
00:53:25,656 --> 00:53:27,565
but don't you ever lie
to me again.

644
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:33,648
Because I'll forgive you once,
but I won't forgive you twice.

645
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,764
Everything all right here?

646
00:53:52,532 --> 00:53:54,473
Yep. Oop.

647
00:53:59,091 --> 00:54:00,335
Oh, jeez.

648
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:04,494
Don't tell me.
You are... Ray.

649
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,642
No.

650
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,449
Ned?
No.

651
00:54:09,489 --> 00:54:11,278
It has three letters.

652
00:54:11,313 --> 00:54:13,036
Max.

653
00:54:13,073 --> 00:54:14,447
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

654
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:17,607
Well, who am I?

655
00:54:17,648 --> 00:54:19,884
I don't have any idea
who you are.

656
00:54:19,919 --> 00:54:21,163
Well, I'm Judy.

657
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,102
I am Nora's big sister.

658
00:54:25,647 --> 00:54:26,890
Her sister?

659
00:54:26,927 --> 00:54:28,814
Where is that girl?

660
00:54:28,846 --> 00:54:30,123
She's at work.

661
00:54:31,246 --> 00:54:32,674
May I come in?

662
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,166
Uh, um, yeah. Come in.

663
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:38,571
Thank you.
I'm not surprised...

664
00:54:38,604 --> 00:54:41,800
if she didn't tell you
anything about me.

665
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:44,008
Who's winning?

666
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:47,338
I don't know.
I, uh... fell asleep.

667
00:54:49,643 --> 00:54:52,958
She never was very tidy.

668
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,473
I left her back home
with Mr. And Mrs. Robles.

669
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:07,077
I can still see her face
watching me walking up the road.

670
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,927
Maybe I should've taken her
with me that day,

671
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:12,642
but I just didn't know how.

672
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:14,718
I didn't know
where I was going myself.

673
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:16,831
God, I was only 17.

674
00:55:18,278 --> 00:55:21,626
But I heard a voice that told me
to pack up and go...

675
00:55:22,597 --> 00:55:24,026
and I believed it.

676
00:55:25,796 --> 00:55:28,000
And there was that face,

677
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:31,865
watching me leave her behind
with no warning.

678
00:55:34,275 --> 00:55:36,184
But here you are.

679
00:55:38,274 --> 00:55:40,794
I could feel it in Albuquerque.

680
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:42,907
We call that precognition.

681
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:46,716
- Do you believe in precognition?
- I've never experienced it.

682
00:55:46,753 --> 00:55:49,305
Oh, such beautiful eyes.

683
00:55:52,192 --> 00:55:54,232
I can see the pain
in them, though.

684
00:55:54,272 --> 00:55:56,344
I'd like a drink.
Do you want a drink?

685
00:55:58,303 --> 00:55:59,547
Max.

686
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,907
Don't you resist me.

687
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,917
Well, frankly,
I'm a nonbeliever.

688
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,859
That's OK.
That don't matter.

689
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,793
Now, there are many strong
forces at work in your life.

690
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,257
Yeah, I'd say so.

691
00:56:18,748 --> 00:56:20,984
You're so intelligent and...

692
00:56:22,108 --> 00:56:23,536
imaginative.

693
00:56:26,747 --> 00:56:27,859
Come here.

694
00:56:33,945 --> 00:56:36,497
You're not satisfied
in your work.

695
00:56:37,784 --> 00:56:39,377
You're a teacher.

696
00:56:41,624 --> 00:56:43,314
I was.

697
00:56:43,352 --> 00:56:45,293
Well, you're
going to teach again.

698
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:48,492
You need more faith.

699
00:56:50,903 --> 00:56:53,586
Your life is heavily
influenced by women.

700
00:56:56,341 --> 00:56:59,058
I see an older woman.
It's your mother.

701
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:01,770
She's a hard-working woman.

702
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,609
Yes.

703
00:57:06,228 --> 00:57:08,016
I see Nora.

704
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:12,012
You're trying to make
a place for Nora.

705
00:57:15,218 --> 00:57:16,811
I see someone else.

706
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:22,093
There's another woman
in the way...

707
00:57:24,977 --> 00:57:27,147
someone on the other side.

708
00:57:27,184 --> 00:57:28,329
There's...

709
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:32,005
There's something wrong
with her neck.

710
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:33,291
It's broken.

711
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,771
How did you know that?

712
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:40,134
What, honey?

713
00:57:40,174 --> 00:57:41,450
How could you know that?

714
00:57:42,574 --> 00:57:45,094
Know what, honey?
Don't be afraid.

715
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:47,522
Come on.
There's no evil here.

716
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:51,176
You got to have faith
in the unknown,

717
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:53,219
and then you'll
come to know it.

718
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:55,684
Honey.

719
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:10,049
Anybody here
want a drink?

720
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:11,649
Oh, heavens, no.

721
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,055
I gave that up years ago.

722
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:15,649
You're not drinking
too much, are you?

723
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:16,800
Ha ha!

724
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:20,935
I want to hear all about
your life these days.

725
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:22,374
My life's just fine.

726
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:24,795
Oh, I think
that's just wonderful.

727
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:26,719
How about your job?

728
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:29,889
Are you still in, what,
food preparation?

729
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:31,038
Yep.

730
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:36,474
And I can see how
your romantic life is going.

731
00:58:37,285 --> 00:58:40,513
I believe the stars
are in your favor.

732
00:58:42,403 --> 00:58:44,126
Judy.
Hmm?

733
00:58:44,164 --> 00:58:45,724
Max doesn't want to hear
about that shit.

734
00:58:45,763 --> 00:58:47,007
That's OK.

735
00:58:47,043 --> 00:58:48,156
See?

736
00:58:49,122 --> 00:58:50,845
Not everybody is as negative...

737
00:58:50,883 --> 00:58:53,599
about the influence of the stars
as you are.

738
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:58,070
Come on. I want to know
how you two met.

739
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,599
I picked him up in a bar.
How's that?

740
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,562
I was drunk,
and she was drunk,

741
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:14,678
and I liked her looks,

742
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:17,565
so I convinced her
to let me bring her home,

743
00:59:17,598 --> 00:59:20,467
and I seduced her
on the sofa bed,

744
00:59:20,509 --> 00:59:22,364
and it was magic,

745
00:59:22,397 --> 00:59:24,633
and I keep coming back
for more.

746
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:30,386
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

747
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:36,304
This man loves you.

748
00:59:58,391 --> 01:00:00,430
Thanks, Max.

749
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,358
A lot going on
behind those eyes, huh?

750
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,430
I thought you were fake.

751
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:08,114
Well, the proof's always
in the pudding, isn't it?

752
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:09,872
Besides, nothing to be
afraid of, you know.

753
01:00:09,909 --> 01:00:13,105
I never tell people what they'd
be better off not knowing.

754
01:00:13,748 --> 01:00:16,301
You know, I try and stay on
the positive side.

755
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:20,784
I see something negative,
I just keep it to myself.

756
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:27,817
I gave Nora a reading
when Charlie was just a baby.

757
01:00:28,466 --> 01:00:30,702
I saw right then
how he'd end up.

758
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:33,226
I never told Nora, of course,

759
01:00:33,265 --> 01:00:36,942
but I just had to carry
that secret all those years...

760
01:00:37,904 --> 01:00:39,660
because I saw him, you know...

761
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:44,900
lying right there in that
section of the river Des Peres,

762
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:47,976
right where they found him
14 years later.

763
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:50,501
Everybody thought
it was an accident,

764
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:53,738
but he was full of whiskey,
full of drugs.

765
01:00:55,342 --> 01:00:58,375
Maybe she thought that boy
might be her finest hour...

766
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:02,817
but given fate
and a son-of-a-bitch husband...

767
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,216
her own not believing
in herself...

768
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,892
she lost in life again.

769
01:01:12,939 --> 01:01:16,287
I think maybe she gave up trying
anything after that...

770
01:01:18,857 --> 01:01:20,286
maybe till you.

771
01:01:28,296 --> 01:01:30,565
Well, bye.
I got to go.

772
01:01:35,815 --> 01:01:38,019
I got to be in New York City
by Thursday.

773
01:01:38,054 --> 01:01:40,290
I'm cooking a turkey
for my friends.

774
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:13,852
Did she go?

775
01:02:13,888 --> 01:02:15,001
Yeah.

776
01:02:40,604 --> 01:02:42,513
How come you never
told me about her?

777
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:46,033
Because she left me
a long time ago.

778
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:51,471
She loves you.

779
01:02:53,242 --> 01:02:54,834
She wants her family.

780
01:02:57,081 --> 01:02:59,153
I don't know
about family anymore.

781
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:10,832
Are you and I family?

782
01:03:14,518 --> 01:03:15,795
Yes.

783
01:03:25,876 --> 01:03:27,153
"Mushrooms. "

784
01:03:28,276 --> 01:03:33,032
Yeah, um, "asparagus,
basil, olive oil,

785
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:35,148
coffee, toilet paper. "

786
01:03:35,795 --> 01:03:37,835
Wait. I forgot parmesan.

787
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:38,955
No. I got it.

788
01:03:38,994 --> 01:03:40,074
Where?

789
01:03:40,114 --> 01:03:42,186
I'll be right back.
We need Reggiano.

790
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:53,036
Quarter pound
of Reggiano, please.

791
01:03:53,072 --> 01:03:55,406
Produce, pick up
the line for a price check,

792
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,585
register two.

793
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,030
Max Baron, shame on you.

794
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:10,629
Where have you been?

795
01:04:10,669 --> 01:04:12,392
We can't reach you anywhere.

796
01:04:12,429 --> 01:04:14,949
I just left my millionth
Thanksgiving invitation...

797
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:16,068
on your machine.

798
01:04:16,108 --> 01:04:17,668
Rachel, thank you.
How are you?

799
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:21,220
Super. Now, I want you to bring
your mystery lady, too.

800
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:24,074
Hi there.
How are you?

801
01:04:24,106 --> 01:04:25,219
Fine.

802
01:04:29,226 --> 01:04:30,305
I'll be right back.

803
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:31,622
OK.

804
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:41,286
We need a price check
on register two, please.

805
01:04:42,824 --> 01:04:44,896
Price check on register two.

806
01:04:44,935 --> 01:04:46,145
You never call me
anymore.

807
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:47,262
Remember last Thanksgiving?

808
01:04:47,303 --> 01:04:49,244
I know,
but it won't be that bad.

809
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:52,701
No, I promise...
I won't let it, OK?

810
01:05:14,146 --> 01:05:15,575
I'm in sort of a hurry, Rachel.

811
01:05:15,618 --> 01:05:17,178
I'm counting on you.

812
01:05:17,218 --> 01:05:18,941
I want to see
your beautiful new friend,

813
01:05:18,977 --> 01:05:20,864
and I want you to see
my beautiful new house.

814
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:23,264
I'm not sure we can make it,
but I'll call you tomorrow.

815
01:05:23,297 --> 01:05:24,377
Max.

816
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:27,897
$129.14, please.

817
01:05:27,936 --> 01:05:29,048
What?

818
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:34,012
- How much?
- $129.14.

819
01:05:36,575 --> 01:05:38,811
Cleanup on aisle 7 A.

820
01:05:43,133 --> 01:05:45,043
Sorry. Here's some cheese.

821
01:05:46,013 --> 01:05:47,257
What took you so long?

822
01:05:47,293 --> 01:05:49,813
I ran into a woman.
I forget her name.

823
01:05:49,852 --> 01:05:51,412
She's a big talker.

824
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:52,695
How we doing?

825
01:05:52,732 --> 01:05:53,844
Fine.

826
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,009
How about a drink?

827
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:06,162
How about it?

828
01:06:09,849 --> 01:06:11,442
It's so quiet here.

829
01:06:13,848 --> 01:06:15,408
What do you have to pay
to live here?

830
01:06:15,448 --> 01:06:17,651
You know,
rents are high these days.

831
01:06:17,688 --> 01:06:19,280
So what do you pay?

832
01:06:20,247 --> 01:06:21,523
A lot.

833
01:06:22,807 --> 01:06:25,807
Wait a minute.
We get naked with each other...

834
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:27,570
and touch each other
and you get inside me,

835
01:06:27,606 --> 01:06:29,810
and you can't tell me
how much rent you pay?

836
01:06:29,845 --> 01:06:32,049
Your landlord knows.
You're not even fucking him.

837
01:06:32,085 --> 01:06:34,125
I pay $1,200.
So what?

838
01:06:34,165 --> 01:06:35,921
So nothing.
That's my point.

839
01:06:39,764 --> 01:06:41,008
You read all these?

840
01:06:41,044 --> 01:06:42,604
Most of them.

841
01:06:42,644 --> 01:06:43,887
You ever heard
of Arthur Miller?

842
01:06:43,924 --> 01:06:45,330
Yeah.

843
01:06:45,363 --> 01:06:47,086
He was real good to Marilyn.

844
01:06:47,122 --> 01:06:49,162
He kept her going
when she was coming apart.

845
01:06:49,202 --> 01:06:52,551
Except for him, she would have
died a lot earlier.

846
01:06:53,362 --> 01:06:54,606
She was in real trouble,

847
01:06:54,642 --> 01:06:56,398
trouble nobody knew
anything about.

848
01:06:58,161 --> 01:06:59,917
She wasn't afraid of Arthur.

849
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,527
I think Marilyn was afraid
of everybody, don't you?

850
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,948
- Why do you say that?
- I just guess she was.

851
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:17,030
Why'd you cover up
the message machine?

852
01:07:19,117 --> 01:07:20,546
I didn't c...

853
01:07:37,675 --> 01:07:39,398
Hello, Max.
It's your mother.

854
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:40,841
Suddenly I was invited...

855
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:42,913
to the Horowitzes'
for Thanksgiving.

856
01:07:42,953 --> 01:07:46,302
So why not to their wedding?
So are you going to take me?

857
01:07:46,345 --> 01:07:47,871
Let me know.

858
01:07:47,913 --> 01:07:49,636
Where are you?

859
01:07:49,672 --> 01:07:53,316
I have a funny earache.
Why aren't you home anymore?

860
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:56,991
Hello, Max Baron.
This is Corrine Miller.

861
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:59,879
Remember me? Creative Director
at Corwin, Hiller, and Greene?

862
01:07:59,911 --> 01:08:01,471
Let's have breakfast sometime.

863
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:03,071
418-3586.

864
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:08,830
Maxie, it's Heidi Solomon,
and you don't call me back.

865
01:08:08,869 --> 01:08:11,236
Is it true you have
a lady in your life?

866
01:08:11,269 --> 01:08:12,676
Oh, well. Give me a call.

867
01:08:13,828 --> 01:08:15,072
Max, it's Rachel.

868
01:08:15,108 --> 01:08:16,996
I invited your mother
for Thanksgiving.

869
01:08:17,028 --> 01:08:18,272
Was that so bad of me?

870
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:19,551
You still haven't told me...

871
01:08:19,587 --> 01:08:21,954
if you're bringing your mystery
woman for turkey dinner...

872
01:08:21,987 --> 01:08:24,027
I mean, unless you'd like
to bring Rita Fishman.

873
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,789
She'd die to come with you.

874
01:08:25,827 --> 01:08:27,866
This is my millionth
message, Max,

875
01:08:27,906 --> 01:08:30,272
and in case the word isn't out,
I'm pregnant.

876
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,964
Call us.

877
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:36,502
Missing pal, what goes?
You don't live there anymore?

878
01:08:36,544 --> 01:08:38,748
Look, Rachel got crazy, invited
your mother to Thanksgiving.

879
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:41,020
Don't blame me.
Call me, OK?

880
01:08:41,664 --> 01:08:43,452
So were you going to invite me?

881
01:08:44,064 --> 01:08:46,267
I don't know if I want to go
to the Horowitzes' myself...

882
01:08:46,303 --> 01:08:47,448
for Thanksgiving.

883
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,334
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

884
01:08:51,262 --> 01:08:53,782
I know I'm a big secret
to your friends.

885
01:08:53,821 --> 01:08:56,570
Well, if I go, you're going.
Are you up to it?

886
01:08:56,605 --> 01:08:57,946
Screw the Horowitzes.

887
01:08:57,981 --> 01:08:59,541
Truth is,
I'm working Thanksgiving.

888
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,489
You are not working
Thanksgiving.

889
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,772
We are going to go
to the Horowitzes'.

890
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:15,248
This is her, huh?

891
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:17,811
That's her.

892
01:09:22,137 --> 01:09:23,566
Hey, Janey.

893
01:09:25,017 --> 01:09:27,089
What do you think
we should do, huh?

894
01:09:27,608 --> 01:09:28,819
Should we go
to the Horowitzes',

895
01:09:28,856 --> 01:09:30,928
or should we just eat
at White Palace?

896
01:09:31,575 --> 01:09:34,095
Maybe we should have some turkey
with Heidi Heidi Ho...

897
01:09:34,135 --> 01:09:35,214
or cranberry sauce...

898
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:37,643
with Corin, Borin,
Storin, and Fishface.

899
01:09:38,454 --> 01:09:40,047
Do you think we should do...

900
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,690
Here's what we're going to do.

901
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:07,854
We're going to go and have
Thanksgiving dinner...

902
01:10:07,889 --> 01:10:09,482
at the Horowitzes'.

903
01:10:11,728 --> 01:10:12,972
You up to it?

904
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:14,350
Absolutely.

905
01:10:16,528 --> 01:10:18,437
They're expecting another Janey.

906
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,724
Janey's dead.

907
01:10:27,694 --> 01:10:30,246
I'm going to go in there.
I'm going to say,

908
01:10:30,286 --> 01:10:32,652
"Hello. My name is Nora, and you
can all go fuck yourselves.

909
01:10:32,685 --> 01:10:34,092
I'm not Janey. "
How's that?

910
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,237
Perfect.

911
01:10:46,763 --> 01:10:49,283
Except I think I made a big
mistake with these shoes...

912
01:10:49,322 --> 01:10:50,402
and maybe my hair.

913
01:10:50,442 --> 01:10:52,198
Nora, your hair is fine.

914
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:59,394
You're not going to all be
talking Jewish, are you?

915
01:11:01,673 --> 01:11:03,844
I was going to make
a sweet potato pie,

916
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,597
but then I thought,
everybody loves noodle pudding.

917
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:08,933
What is that?

918
01:11:08,967 --> 01:11:11,039
She's a friend of mine.
Her name is Nora.

919
01:11:11,078 --> 01:11:14,111
You be nice, Mother, or I'll
beat the shit out of you.

920
01:11:14,918 --> 01:11:18,714
Come on.
Nora, this is my mother Edith.

921
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:20,033
Nice to meet you.

922
01:11:20,997 --> 01:11:22,557
Do you mind if I sit
in the front?

923
01:11:22,597 --> 01:11:25,149
I get carsick
if I sit in the back.

924
01:11:26,277 --> 01:11:27,683
No, no.

925
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:31,712
Sorry.
It's OK.

926
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:39,838
She's no spring chicken.

927
01:11:39,874 --> 01:11:41,302
Just get in the car.

928
01:11:57,471 --> 01:11:58,551
Come on in.

929
01:11:58,591 --> 01:11:59,671
Whee!

930
01:11:59,711 --> 01:12:01,118
Hey, no running.
No running.

931
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,579
Hi there, Max.

932
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:06,426
Honey! Rach, Max is here!

933
01:12:07,517 --> 01:12:09,906
Rach? Honey, Max is here.

934
01:12:09,949 --> 01:12:11,225
Oh, coming!

935
01:12:16,508 --> 01:12:19,355
Hello. I'm Rachel Horowitz.

936
01:12:19,387 --> 01:12:21,110
Hello, Edith.
I'm so happy you could come.

937
01:12:21,147 --> 01:12:23,034
I brought you
my noodle pudding.

938
01:12:23,066 --> 01:12:26,066
Thank you, Edith.
You didn't have to do that.

939
01:12:26,106 --> 01:12:27,513
Rachel, this is Nora Baker.

940
01:12:27,546 --> 01:12:30,393
Welcome to our home, Nora.
Let me take your coat.

941
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:32,946
Thank you, Max.
What would you like to drink?

942
01:12:32,985 --> 01:12:34,414
Oh, do you drink?

943
01:12:34,457 --> 01:12:36,464
Sometimes. Yeah.

944
01:12:36,504 --> 01:12:38,544
Um, do you have
vodka and tonic?

945
01:12:38,584 --> 01:12:40,307
We have everything.
And scotch for you, Max?

946
01:12:40,344 --> 01:12:42,253
No. I'll have
a vodka and tonic, too.

947
01:12:42,296 --> 01:12:43,506
Really? Hmm.

948
01:12:43,543 --> 01:12:46,063
Neil, would you fix
two vodka and tonics?

949
01:12:46,103 --> 01:12:47,346
Two vodka tonics!

950
01:12:47,383 --> 01:12:49,749
Now, Max knows everybody,
I think.

951
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:51,189
Sherri? Sherri?

952
01:12:51,222 --> 01:12:52,945
I'm right here.

953
01:12:52,982 --> 01:12:54,869
This is Sherri Klugman.

954
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:55,981
Sherri, Nora Baker.

955
01:12:56,021 --> 01:12:57,744
Hello, Nora.
Lovely to meet you.

956
01:12:57,781 --> 01:12:59,187
Thank you. Same here.

957
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:00,628
- Hi, Max.
- Hey, Sherri.

958
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,383
Two vodka tonics.

959
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,419
Nora, this is
Neil's father Sol Horowitz.

960
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,183
This is Nora Baker, Dad.

961
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:08,299
Hello, Max.

962
01:13:08,339 --> 01:13:09,583
Sol, you know Max.

963
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:11,179
One of my favorites.

964
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:14,218
Uh, would you excuse me?
I have to check the kitchen.

965
01:13:14,258 --> 01:13:16,330
I have a cranberry problem.

966
01:13:17,777 --> 01:13:18,857
OK.

967
01:13:18,897 --> 01:13:20,174
- You OK?
- Mm-hmm.

968
01:13:23,377 --> 01:13:25,613
Go easy. We have the whole day
ahead of us.

969
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:28,812
You sure you're all right?

970
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:31,018
Stop asking me that.

971
01:13:31,056 --> 01:13:32,168
Max!

972
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,247
Darling! Oh!

973
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:36,781
It's so good to see you.

974
01:13:36,815 --> 01:13:39,018
Oh, darling,
can you believe it?

975
01:13:39,054 --> 01:13:40,461
I'm going to be
a grandmother.

976
01:13:40,494 --> 01:13:42,054
I know. How about that?
How are you doing?

977
01:13:42,094 --> 01:13:46,762
Oh, well, Sol took me to Italy
for my birthday.

978
01:13:47,213 --> 01:13:48,489
That's how I'm doing.

979
01:13:49,772 --> 01:13:51,495
Oh, isn't this house terrific?

980
01:13:51,532 --> 01:13:53,255
Is Rachel one lucky girl?

981
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:54,371
Ha ha!

982
01:13:54,411 --> 01:13:55,971
Oh, and, Noreen...

983
01:13:56,012 --> 01:13:57,091
- Nora.
- Nora!

984
01:13:57,131 --> 01:13:58,537
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

985
01:13:58,571 --> 01:14:00,774
Little Maxie.

986
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:03,331
This is Rachel's mother.
Nora Baker, Sophie Rosen.

987
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:04,450
Aah!

988
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,017
Oh, I'm sorry!

989
01:14:07,049 --> 01:14:08,936
It was an accident.
I'm sorry.

990
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:10,692
I didn't mean to get it
on your carpet.

991
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:12,135
Don't worry about it.

992
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:13,413
Just relax, darling.

993
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:15,357
It's no big deal.

994
01:14:16,648 --> 01:14:18,687
- Hello.
- Hi.

995
01:14:18,728 --> 01:14:20,451
- You're Max's lady.
- I'm with him.

996
01:14:20,487 --> 01:14:22,210
I'm Larry Klugman.

997
01:14:22,247 --> 01:14:23,970
Max and I went
to high school together.

998
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:25,119
Nora Baker.

999
01:14:25,767 --> 01:14:28,668
Oh! Your glass is empty.

1000
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:31,038
What are you drinking?

1001
01:14:32,645 --> 01:14:34,750
Vodka, straight.

1002
01:14:37,924 --> 01:14:39,353
What do you think of our boy?

1003
01:14:40,804 --> 01:14:42,364
Nice boy.

1004
01:14:44,163 --> 01:14:45,243
Here we go.

1005
01:14:45,283 --> 01:14:47,355
Vodka, straight.

1006
01:14:48,002 --> 01:14:49,082
Thanks.

1007
01:14:49,122 --> 01:14:51,969
Honey, can I see you
a second, please?

1008
01:14:52,002 --> 01:14:53,562
I want to show you
the kitchen chairs.

1009
01:14:53,602 --> 01:14:55,642
They're exactly what
we've been looking for.

1010
01:14:55,681 --> 01:14:56,761
Sure.

1011
01:14:56,801 --> 01:14:57,881
Excuse us, please.

1012
01:14:57,921 --> 01:14:59,644
Sure. You better get a peek
at those chairs, Lar.

1013
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,760
Hey, huh?

1014
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,880
Yeah.

1015
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,327
Edith,
don't worry about it.

1016
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,912
Please. I did it.
I want to clean up.

1017
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:08,285
Edith, you're a guest
in the house.

1018
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:10,206
I know, but I want
to get this spot out.

1019
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,645
- Just sit down.
- I did it.

1020
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,173
Just relax.

1021
01:15:14,078 --> 01:15:16,761
I feel so embarrassed.

1022
01:15:16,797 --> 01:15:19,666
Lt'll come out.
Believe me, it'll come out.

1023
01:15:22,237 --> 01:15:23,317
Neil!

1024
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:24,633
In a minute!

1025
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,202
Pamela!

1026
01:15:34,235 --> 01:15:35,412
How are you, Doreen?

1027
01:15:53,912 --> 01:15:55,188
Nora.

1028
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,427
Nora.

1029
01:16:13,428 --> 01:16:15,315
Oh! I'm terribly sorry.
It wasn't locked.

1030
01:16:15,348 --> 01:16:16,591
No, it's all right.
I was just leaving.

1031
01:16:16,628 --> 01:16:18,700
I was putting on my lipstick.

1032
01:16:18,739 --> 01:16:19,949
That's all right.

1033
01:16:19,988 --> 01:16:21,394
Good color... your lipstick.

1034
01:16:21,427 --> 01:16:23,598
And I love your sweater.

1035
01:16:23,634 --> 01:16:24,943
Thanks.

1036
01:16:29,266 --> 01:16:31,305
Listen, I'll just
leave you alone here.

1037
01:16:31,346 --> 01:16:32,425
You can smoke.

1038
01:16:33,137 --> 01:16:34,085
Larry smokes like a chimney.

1039
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:37,391
So... you live in St. Louis?

1040
01:16:37,424 --> 01:16:38,831
Yeah.

1041
01:16:38,864 --> 01:16:39,944
You work in town?

1042
01:16:39,984 --> 01:16:41,391
Yeah, I do.

1043
01:16:41,423 --> 01:16:42,601
What's your work?

1044
01:16:43,984 --> 01:16:45,707
I'm in, uh, food preparation.

1045
01:16:45,743 --> 01:16:47,303
Food preparation?

1046
01:16:47,343 --> 01:16:48,586
That's interesting.

1047
01:16:48,623 --> 01:16:50,477
You mean... catering?

1048
01:16:52,142 --> 01:16:53,898
I'm a waitress.

1049
01:16:53,934 --> 01:16:55,341
Really?

1050
01:16:56,462 --> 01:16:57,607
Where?

1051
01:16:59,341 --> 01:17:01,545
White Palace.
It's a hamburger restaurant.

1052
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:02,692
Oh.

1053
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,121
What do you do?

1054
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,489
I'm a decorator.

1055
01:17:08,459 --> 01:17:11,972
Ohh. I love this scent.
Smell.

1056
01:17:12,779 --> 01:17:13,859
Isn't it subtle?

1057
01:17:13,898 --> 01:17:15,174
Oh, very subtle.

1058
01:17:16,938 --> 01:17:21,509
So... how did you meet Max?

1059
01:17:23,017 --> 01:17:25,766
He came in for a burger. Ha ha!

1060
01:17:25,801 --> 01:17:27,655
How romantic.

1061
01:17:32,295 --> 01:17:34,978
You know, he's quite a catch,
our Max.

1062
01:17:35,014 --> 01:17:36,258
How did you ever do it?

1063
01:17:37,894 --> 01:17:39,748
I give a good blow job, I guess.

1064
01:17:45,413 --> 01:17:46,690
I'll bet you do.

1065
01:17:46,725 --> 01:17:49,114
Ha ha! I'll bet you don't.

1066
01:17:52,612 --> 01:17:54,978
Look, I'm not Janey, OK?

1067
01:17:55,012 --> 01:17:57,532
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

1068
01:17:57,571 --> 01:17:59,359
but you're a guest
in this house,

1069
01:17:59,395 --> 01:18:03,453
and there was a Janey,
but no one is mad at you,

1070
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:05,213
and we don't want to judge you,
and I don't think...

1071
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:08,119
you should be so fast to judge
other people's blow jobs...

1072
01:18:08,929 --> 01:18:12,441
because what you see
isn't always what you get.

1073
01:18:21,247 --> 01:18:23,450
We haven't had decent
leadership in this country...

1074
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,730
the past 10 years.

1075
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,133
Dad, what about
tax reform? What about defense?

1076
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:29,053
What about
a trillion-dollar deficit?

1077
01:18:29,086 --> 01:18:31,835
If we don't have the money,
how can we keep spending it?

1078
01:18:31,869 --> 01:18:33,527
You're a very nice girl, Rachel.

1079
01:18:33,565 --> 01:18:34,971
You're my favorite
daughter-in-law.

1080
01:18:35,005 --> 01:18:36,412
But would it kill you
to pick up a newspaper...

1081
01:18:36,444 --> 01:18:39,608
- Aw, Dad!
- Sol, please!

1082
01:18:39,644 --> 01:18:42,807
Iran scam, H.U.D., El Salvador.

1083
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:44,250
I tell you, those guys
will be lucky...

1084
01:18:44,283 --> 01:18:45,527
if they come off
any better than Nixon.

1085
01:18:45,563 --> 01:18:48,945
I don't know. They seem like
pretty nice guys to me.

1086
01:18:48,986 --> 01:18:50,808
You can't be serious.

1087
01:18:50,842 --> 01:18:52,402
She's entitled to her opinion.

1088
01:18:52,442 --> 01:18:54,329
I'm sorry.
You have to forgive me.

1089
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:55,791
I'm terrible with names.

1090
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:57,360
Nora.

1091
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:58,962
I told you twice already.

1092
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:00,888
Dora, let me just say this.

1093
01:19:00,921 --> 01:19:02,960
That is precisely
the kind of attitude...

1094
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,967
that's landed this country
in the mess that it's in today.

1095
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,080
I don't know if you have any
children or not, but if you do,

1096
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,802
and they inherit
a lifetime of crippling debt,

1097
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:12,726
then I'm not so sure they'll be
such nice guys anymore.

1098
01:19:12,759 --> 01:19:14,003
Dad, come on!

1099
01:19:14,038 --> 01:19:15,445
I'm talking
about people, folks,

1100
01:19:15,478 --> 01:19:18,063
who are unmitigated tragedies
for the working class.

1101
01:19:18,677 --> 01:19:21,676
Mister, I am working class.

1102
01:19:21,717 --> 01:19:23,123
And what the hell do you
know about it anyway?

1103
01:19:23,157 --> 01:19:25,393
It doesn't look to me like
you've been missing many meals.

1104
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:29,105
Sol, enough politics, already.
It's Thanksgiving!

1105
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,928
It doesn't make
any difference to me...

1106
01:19:30,963 --> 01:19:32,240
who's in the goddamn
White House.

1107
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:33,682
Merle Haggard
could be made president,

1108
01:19:33,715 --> 01:19:34,959
and I'll be in Shit City.

1109
01:19:34,994 --> 01:19:36,401
I'll still be choking
on burger grease.

1110
01:19:36,435 --> 01:19:38,638
I'll still be busting my hump
for the minimum fucking wage,

1111
01:19:38,675 --> 01:19:41,674
and Betty here...
she'll be serving you turkey...

1112
01:19:41,713 --> 01:19:43,339
for 30 bucks a day, right?

1113
01:19:58,351 --> 01:19:59,594
Excuse me.

1114
01:19:59,631 --> 01:20:00,743
I'm going home.

1115
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:02,634
Max.

1116
01:20:02,671 --> 01:20:05,037
Max. Max.

1117
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:06,793
Max. Max!

1118
01:20:06,829 --> 01:20:09,644
Max, bring her back in here.
She's still a person.

1119
01:20:09,677 --> 01:20:11,749
I came with them.
I have to leave with them.

1120
01:20:11,789 --> 01:20:14,155
No, no!
You don't have to go home.

1121
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:15,432
Max.

1122
01:20:15,468 --> 01:20:17,256
Max, bring her in here!

1123
01:20:33,545 --> 01:20:35,486
I don't expect you
to sleep here tonight.

1124
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:36,739
Why?

1125
01:20:43,944 --> 01:20:45,536
You're a son of a bitch.
You know that?

1126
01:20:47,463 --> 01:20:48,542
What did I do?

1127
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,470
You lied to me again.

1128
01:20:50,502 --> 01:20:52,390
That woman I saw you talking to
in the supermarket...

1129
01:20:52,422 --> 01:20:53,502
that was Rachel.

1130
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:55,298
You told me you forgot her name.

1131
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,340
You just didn't
want us to meet.

1132
01:20:57,381 --> 01:20:59,269
The truth is, you were
a little anxious that day.

1133
01:20:59,301 --> 01:21:01,188
I didn't think that you
were up to an introduction.

1134
01:21:01,221 --> 01:21:04,068
You had no intention
of inviting me to Thanksgiving.

1135
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,529
You were trapped into it.

1136
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,415
You hide me like I'm shit.

1137
01:21:09,219 --> 01:21:11,706
You tell me I'm beautiful,
and then you hide me like shit.

1138
01:21:12,258 --> 01:21:13,338
You lied to me.

1139
01:21:13,378 --> 01:21:14,939
How can you talk to me
about lying?

1140
01:21:14,978 --> 01:21:17,344
What about that thing you carry
around with you all day...

1141
01:21:17,378 --> 01:21:19,549
that I never hear about?
What about Charlie?

1142
01:21:19,585 --> 01:21:21,014
Judy told me the truth
about Charlie.

1143
01:21:21,057 --> 01:21:23,097
You leave my Charlie
out of this.

1144
01:21:23,137 --> 01:21:24,544
That's none of your business.

1145
01:21:24,576 --> 01:21:26,780
I took you into my life tonight.
It is my business.

1146
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:28,823
You were trapped into it.

1147
01:21:30,016 --> 01:21:31,292
I took you there.

1148
01:21:35,775 --> 01:21:37,368
Max, what are you going to do?

1149
01:21:38,814 --> 01:21:40,537
Just going to keep me
in some little box...

1150
01:21:40,574 --> 01:21:42,810
and take me out whenever
you feel like playing with me?

1151
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:47,125
Do you think I'm a fool?

1152
01:21:49,372 --> 01:21:51,444
No, I don't think
you're a fool.

1153
01:21:54,012 --> 01:21:55,768
I just wanted
to get that straight.

1154
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:00,399
Now leave me alone, will you?

1155
01:23:06,704 --> 01:23:07,881
Looking for Nora?

1156
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,999
Yeah.

1157
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:12,551
Yeah... she's finished. Hmm!

1158
01:23:13,038 --> 01:23:14,150
She quit.

1159
01:23:15,278 --> 01:23:16,423
What do you mean?

1160
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:19,434
I mean she quit.

1161
01:23:19,469 --> 01:23:21,673
She just quit.

1162
01:23:43,434 --> 01:23:44,546
Nora?

1163
01:24:20,868 --> 01:24:22,591
Dear Max,

1164
01:24:22,627 --> 01:24:25,180
by the time you read
this letter, I'll be gone.

1165
01:24:25,986 --> 01:24:27,709
You won't believe me,

1166
01:24:27,746 --> 01:24:29,818
but I'm doing this
for both of us.

1167
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:32,345
If I told you where I'm at,

1168
01:24:32,386 --> 01:24:35,734
it would only make it
harder on us, so I won't.

1169
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:40,668
Charlie is the only thing
I ever lied about to you.

1170
01:24:40,704 --> 01:24:43,867
The rest is true, including
how you made me feel...

1171
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,813
real good about myself
sometimes.

1172
01:24:47,423 --> 01:24:49,146
Yeah, sometimes
I think Charlie did it...

1173
01:24:49,182 --> 01:24:51,254
to get back
at his father and me.

1174
01:24:52,062 --> 01:24:55,378
We weren't the best parents,
and I guess that's something...

1175
01:24:55,422 --> 01:24:57,494
I'll always have trouble
having in my heart.

1176
01:24:58,781 --> 01:25:00,690
I'm sorry
about what happened...

1177
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,925
but I know it's wrong
for us to be together...

1178
01:25:05,179 --> 01:25:06,608
even though I love you.

1179
01:25:08,059 --> 01:25:09,652
So I'm leaving town.

1180
01:25:10,459 --> 01:25:12,662
Please don't look for me.

1181
01:25:12,699 --> 01:25:14,935
No matter what you say
you feel about me...

1182
01:25:15,738 --> 01:25:17,330
I know one thing for sure.

1183
01:25:19,097 --> 01:25:20,341
You can't look me in the eye...

1184
01:25:20,378 --> 01:25:22,450
and tell me
I don't embarrass you.

1185
01:25:24,217 --> 01:25:25,329
Good-bye.

1186
01:25:26,936 --> 01:25:29,008
Love, Nora.

1187
01:25:55,892 --> 01:25:59,207
Hey, Maxie.
I heard you're having problems.

1188
01:25:59,251 --> 01:26:01,138
Now it's time to cheer up.

1189
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:03,537
Heidi Solomon's having
a brunch on Sunday.

1190
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:05,774
All your friends are coming,
so you be there.

1191
01:26:05,809 --> 01:26:06,889
You hear me?

1192
01:26:06,929 --> 01:26:09,318
We all love you. Bye.

1193
01:26:17,968 --> 01:26:19,212
Can I get you anything?

1194
01:26:19,247 --> 01:26:20,327
Yeah. Sure.

1195
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:21,960
OK. Excuse me.

1196
01:26:23,086 --> 01:26:24,363
I got to tell you something.

1197
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:26,573
- You look great.
- Thank you.

1198
01:26:26,607 --> 01:26:28,013
...for about six weeks?

1199
01:26:28,046 --> 01:26:29,126
Yeah.

1200
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:30,245
What got you to go to Africa?

1201
01:26:30,286 --> 01:26:32,489
Oh, well, I like photography,

1202
01:26:32,525 --> 01:26:35,208
and they have these
photographic safaris.

1203
01:26:35,245 --> 01:26:37,350
Did you take
the pictures over there?

1204
01:26:37,388 --> 01:26:38,882
Yeah. Can you believe it?

1205
01:26:38,924 --> 01:26:41,160
They're very good.
You should be a professional.

1206
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:44,992
Well... well, I certainly felt
professional when I took them.

1207
01:26:45,035 --> 01:26:47,042
Can you believe that I was
this close to that hippo...

1208
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:48,326
as to that wall?

1209
01:26:48,363 --> 01:26:50,020
You really should make the trip.

1210
01:26:54,282 --> 01:26:56,518
So, what kind
of camera do you have?

1211
01:26:57,641 --> 01:26:59,844
Um... Nikon.

1212
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,255
What do you use?

1213
01:27:01,288 --> 01:27:02,881
A Canon E-X,

1214
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,767
and I just bought
a little Olympus.

1215
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,229
Do you take a lot of pictures?

1216
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:11,046
I'm more into music.

1217
01:27:11,078 --> 01:27:13,412
Oh. Well,
I knew that about you.

1218
01:27:13,446 --> 01:27:15,355
I tried to get you
to a concert, you rat.

1219
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:16,478
Oh. Right.

1220
01:27:16,518 --> 01:27:17,598
You never called me back.

1221
01:27:17,637 --> 01:27:20,157
Excuse me.
The Goodmans are here.

1222
01:27:20,197 --> 01:27:21,277
We almost got lost.

1223
01:27:21,317 --> 01:27:22,594
Hi. How are you?

1224
01:27:32,515 --> 01:27:33,725
Hi there.

1225
01:27:33,763 --> 01:27:35,355
Hi, sweetie.
Hi.

1226
01:27:35,395 --> 01:27:37,434
Oh, Maxie.

1227
01:27:37,475 --> 01:27:41,118
So, what was Miss Solomon
telling you?

1228
01:27:41,154 --> 01:27:42,397
Uh, about Africa.

1229
01:27:42,434 --> 01:27:43,678
Uh-huh.

1230
01:27:43,713 --> 01:27:45,753
She took the pictures
on the wall.

1231
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:47,037
Ooh.

1232
01:27:47,073 --> 01:27:48,153
Talented.

1233
01:27:48,193 --> 01:27:49,916
She's a gorgeous girl, huh?

1234
01:27:49,952 --> 01:27:52,156
Huh? Gorgeous? Gorgeous?

1235
01:27:52,191 --> 01:27:53,752
Gorgeous? Huh?

1236
01:27:53,792 --> 01:27:55,036
She cooks.

1237
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:56,794
She travels.

1238
01:27:56,831 --> 01:27:58,871
She's a perfect hostess.

1239
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:00,797
Beautiful.

1240
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:02,106
How do you know?

1241
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,499
- Well, just...
- What?

1242
01:28:05,629 --> 01:28:08,018
How do you know
who's right for each other?

1243
01:28:10,909 --> 01:28:12,316
Well, you...

1244
01:28:12,348 --> 01:28:14,257
I mean, the Goodmans
or the...

1245
01:28:16,187 --> 01:28:17,616
or the Clarks or...

1246
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:20,307
Andie and Jasper?

1247
01:28:20,347 --> 01:28:23,194
I mean, we all said
they're perfect for one another,

1248
01:28:23,227 --> 01:28:24,503
and they didn't last a year.

1249
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:27,506
Larry and Sherri?

1250
01:28:27,546 --> 01:28:30,546
I've never heard Larry say
a decent word about his wife.

1251
01:28:30,585 --> 01:28:34,261
Hey, hey, Max.
What are you talking about, huh?

1252
01:28:45,783 --> 01:28:47,855
There's no dust
in her Dustbuster.

1253
01:28:48,503 --> 01:28:50,063
What?

1254
01:28:50,102 --> 01:28:52,655
There's no dust
in her Dustbuster!

1255
01:28:54,102 --> 01:28:55,662
What did he say?

1256
01:28:55,701 --> 01:28:57,457
Something about a Dustbuster?

1257
01:29:08,819 --> 01:29:10,575
Max,
where are you going?

1258
01:30:12,969 --> 01:30:14,048
Yes?

1259
01:30:14,089 --> 01:30:15,812
It's Max.

1260
01:30:15,848 --> 01:30:18,237
Oh, my God. Don't move.

1261
01:30:37,444 --> 01:30:38,524
How are you, Judy?

1262
01:30:38,564 --> 01:30:40,931
She told you not to come.

1263
01:30:40,964 --> 01:30:42,076
Where is she?

1264
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:46,872
I knew something was on the way,
but, oh, my God.

1265
01:30:49,603 --> 01:30:51,839
You've given up resistance.

1266
01:30:52,514 --> 01:30:54,074
Tell me where she is.

1267
01:31:21,117 --> 01:31:22,677
Here you go.

1268
01:31:22,717 --> 01:31:23,796
You all finished?

1269
01:31:23,837 --> 01:31:25,397
Uh, yeah.
Maybe a piece of...

1270
01:31:25,436 --> 01:31:26,516
OK, I'll bring you the menu.

1271
01:31:26,556 --> 01:31:27,963
I'll have cheesecake,

1272
01:31:27,996 --> 01:31:30,101
and he's going to have
a slice of chocolate cake.

1273
01:31:42,394 --> 01:31:44,946
Lady, I'm in the middle
of ordering!

1274
01:31:51,512 --> 01:31:52,756
Table for one, sir?

1275
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:54,548
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

1276
01:31:58,551 --> 01:32:00,144
Have a nice meal.

1277
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:06,830
I asked you not to follow me.

1278
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:08,113
I need to tell you
something.

1279
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:09,360
Go away.

1280
01:32:09,397 --> 01:32:11,633
I just want you to listen to me.

1281
01:32:11,733 --> 01:32:15,027
Nora, I've been selfish
and careless.

1282
01:32:15,828 --> 01:32:17,388
I've been stupid.

1283
01:32:17,428 --> 01:32:18,671
I don't belong in your life.

1284
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:20,398
You're wrong.
You do belong.

1285
01:32:21,747 --> 01:32:23,470
I've got a new life.
I feel good about myself.

1286
01:32:23,507 --> 01:32:24,936
I can't go back.

1287
01:32:27,986 --> 01:32:31,946
You get yourself a...
a nice young girl...

1288
01:32:31,985 --> 01:32:35,945
with a college education
who won't embarrass you.

1289
01:32:35,985 --> 01:32:37,708
You're not
an embarrassment to me.

1290
01:32:37,744 --> 01:32:39,653
I'm an embarrassment to me.

1291
01:32:41,424 --> 01:32:43,660
I just got this job.
I don't want to lose it.

1292
01:32:45,743 --> 01:32:47,947
I thought that you
didn't fit into my life,

1293
01:32:47,982 --> 01:32:49,575
but it was me who didn't fit.

1294
01:32:50,862 --> 01:32:51,942
Go back to St. Louis.

1295
01:32:51,982 --> 01:32:53,737
I don't live
in St. Louis anymore.

1296
01:32:54,382 --> 01:32:55,942
I left St. Louis.

1297
01:32:55,981 --> 01:32:58,021
I quit my job,
and I quit the city.

1298
01:32:58,061 --> 01:33:02,054
I just looked at a room to rent
over at 49th and 9th Avenue.

1299
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:06,347
It has a little stove
and a little refrigerator...

1300
01:33:06,379 --> 01:33:08,768
and a view of the trash cans.

1301
01:33:10,539 --> 01:33:12,295
All I need now is a job.

1302
01:33:13,258 --> 01:33:15,145
I'd like to go
back to teaching.

1303
01:33:18,697 --> 01:33:21,380
Max, people just
don't change overnight.

1304
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:22,561
People discover things...

1305
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:23,778
about themselves in life,
don't they?

1306
01:33:23,817 --> 01:33:25,704
And they only hope
that it isn't too late.

1307
01:33:25,736 --> 01:33:27,623
I don't want
a nice young girl.

1308
01:33:27,656 --> 01:33:29,249
I had a nice young girl.

1309
01:33:30,215 --> 01:33:31,328
I want you.

1310
01:33:38,854 --> 01:33:40,447
I love you, Nora.

1311
01:33:48,133 --> 01:33:50,849
Come on, buddy.
Are you going to order or what?

1312
01:33:57,251 --> 01:33:58,680
What will you have?

1313
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:06,305
You got any Oak Ridge Boys?

1314
01:34:13,408 --> 01:34:15,480
Honey, I got
everything you need.

1315
01:34:46,523 --> 01:34:48,083
So how's your mother?

1316
01:34:48,283 --> 01:34:53,283
