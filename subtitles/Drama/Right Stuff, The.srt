1
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,580
There was a demon that lived in the air.

2
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,900
They said whoever challenged him
would die.

3
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,260
Their controls would freeze up.

4
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,820
Their planes would buffet wildly...

5
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,700
and they would disintegrate.

6
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,900
The demon lived at Mach 1 on the meter...

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,580
750 miles an hour...

8
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,980
where the air could no longer
move out of the way.

9
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,140
He lived behind a barrier through which
they said no man could ever pass.

10
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,180
They called it the sound barrier.

11
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,540
Then they built a small plane...

12
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,100
the X-1, to try and break the sound barrier.

13
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,300
And men came to the high desert
of California to ride it.

14
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,380
They were called test pilots...

15
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,300
and no one knew their names.

16
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,300
Okay, Whiskey Kilo 28, prepare to drop.

17
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,140
Roger, Ground Control.
This is Whiskey Kilo 28...

18
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,580
lowering and launching... now.

19
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,340
Mach.92.

20
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,620
.93.

21
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,100
.94.

22
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,140
Hit a mild buffet there.

23
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,820
Mach.95.

24
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,180
.96.

25
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,940
.97.

26
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,140
.98!

27
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,940
.99!

28
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,060
WK 28, do you want to declare
an emergency?

29
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,780
Negative. WK 28 is not...

30
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,860
Go away.

31
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,020
I was looking at the pictures on your wall.

32
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,700
How come a fancy pilot...

33
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,940
like Slick there,
doesn't have his picture up there?

34
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,260
What do you have to do
to get your picture up there?

35
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,140
You have to die, sweetie.

36
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,180
Well, Yeager, you old bastard.

37
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,540
Don't just stand in the doorway
like some lonesome sheepherder.

38
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,780
Get your ass over here and have a drink.

39
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,420
I got you something.

40
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,180
Come here.

41
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,300
You could be the first.

42
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,300
The man who breaks the sound barrier
will be on top.

43
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,340
You'd be the one they remembered.

44
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,100
You're the best civilian pilot around.

45
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,180
Good afternoon.

46
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,020
You get that helmet?

47
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,300
It might work.

48
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,380
I'll look like the Galloping Ghost in it.

49
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,500
Some people say the sound barrier
can't be broke.

50
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,660
An engineer will tell you it's an absolute...

51
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,820
like the firmness of the earth.

52
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,380
The sound barrier is a farm
you can buy in the sky.

53
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,740
The controls will freeze up.
You can't budge the stick.

54
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,460
Anybody tries to break it will auger in.

55
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,980
Well now, maybe it can't be broke.

56
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,340
Then again...

57
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,060
maybe it can.

58
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,860
Maybe it can only be broke
for a specified sum.

59
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,700
How much?

60
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,340
$150,000.

61
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,180
Come on, Slick, give us a break.

62
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,420
Non-negotiable, as usual.

63
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,260
What do we do now?

64
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,260
That guy in the corner...

65
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,260
Yeager is his name.

66
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,540
He's some kind of a war hero.
Shot down five Germans in one day.

67
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,020
He's a natural-born stick-and-rudder man.

68
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,220
He's press-liaison man for the Air Force,
I think.

69
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,620
Any problems with him?

70
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,420
- Only one.
- What's that?

71
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,460
Holding him back.

72
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
Major.

73
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,020
- Hey there, Yeager.
- Sir.

74
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,220
We were just talking to Slick
about the sound barrier.

75
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,660
Is that right?

76
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,420
We feel that the X-1
is ready to have a go at it.

77
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,980
We think the X-1's got the answer
to go beyond Mach 1.

78
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,060
If there is any beyond.

79
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,500
So, what do you think?

80
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,060
I'll tell you. Half these engineers
have never been off the ground.

81
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,500
They might tell you that
the sound barrier's a brick wall.

82
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,500
It'll rip your ears off
if you try to go through it.

83
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,900
If you ask me,
I don't believe the damn thing even exists.

84
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,140
Waitress, a drink for Mr. Yeager.

85
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,740
No, thanks, I got one.

86
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,100
So, do you think
you want to have a go at it?

87
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,540
I might.

88
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,500
But since, as you say,
this sound barrier doesn't really exist...

89
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,580
how much...

90
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,100
How much you got?

91
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,140
Just joking.
The Air Force is already paying me. Right?

92
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,660
- Why sure, Yeager...
- So when do we go?

93
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,420
How about tomorrow morning?

94
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,580
I'll be there.

95
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,940
See you there.

96
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,780
How much are you paying him?

97
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,580
I think it's $283.

98
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,980
A week?

99
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,460
A month.

100
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,460
Well, that's not bad.

101
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,220
First fellow to break the sound barrier...

102
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,100
gets a free steak with all the trimmings.

103
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,060
I'll have mine medium rare, please.

104
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,460
Honey, you ever been caught
on the desert alone?

105
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,300
I never have.

106
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,540
I don't think I ever will.

107
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,780
Never met the man
who could catch me out there.

108
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,580
I'm half jackrabbit.

109
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,380
Forget it, flyboy.

110
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,540
You'd never catch me.

111
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,820
I believe I will.

112
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,860
Can't be done.

113
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,300
Could I ask you something?

114
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,300
Forget it, sweetie.

115
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,540
She's his wife.

116
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,740
Come on, baby.

117
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,700
Yeah! Come on. Go, go.

118
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,980
Glennis! I'm gonna get you!

119
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,660
Come back here!

120
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,020
Can't hide from me!

121
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,820
- 'Morning, tiger.
- What have you two been up to?

122
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,900
Where's Ridley?

123
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,940
Over there waiting on you.

124
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,860
Can I talk to you?

125
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,140
I got a little problem.

126
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,540
A horse threw me last night
and I dinged up my goddamn ribs.

127
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
How bad?

128
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,740
I feel like I broke a couple
of the sons of bitches.

129
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,940
I won't be able to lean over
to shut the door. Got any ideas?

130
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,500
Your left side okay?

131
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,340
I don't want these guys to know
because they'll find somebody else to fly.

132
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,900
- I'll try to fix you a handle.
- Thanks, man.

133
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,780
Can you help me out?
I got a small emergency.

134
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,900
I need to borrow your broom handle.
Just hold this right here.

135
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,060
I think that'll work.

136
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,180
Thank you, sir.

137
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,300
Punch a hole in the sky.

138
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,060
I'll be right back.

139
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,380
- 'Morning!
- Good morning, sir.

140
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,780
How are you feeling?

141
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,340
Oh, just about right.

142
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,900
There she is, partner.
All bridled, saddled and ready to go.

143
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,780
You got any Beemans?

144
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,540
Yeah, I got a stick.

145
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,660
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

146
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,900
Fair enough.

147
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,380
Hey, look.

148
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,660
Stick this in the handle.
Take your good arm and just whang it.

149
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,940
Okay, thanks, buddy.

150
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,060
Pre-drop checklist complete.

151
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,140
Ten, nine...

152
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,140
Drop!

153
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,220
There you go, buddy.

154
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,700
Put your spurs to her, Chuck.

155
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,580
Mach.91.

156
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,580
.92.

157
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,740
.93.

158
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,780
Hit a mild buffet there.

159
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,740
Just the usual instability.

160
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,860
Ridley, make a note here,
would you, if you got...

161
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,020
nothing better to do.
Elevator effectiveness regained.

162
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,260
.95.

163
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,340
.96.

164
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,300
More buffeting.

165
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,620
More commotion.

166
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,300
Getting wobbly here.

167
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,380
.98.

168
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,020
She's getting real active.

169
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,020
.99!

170
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,060
What's that sound?

171
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,060
He bought the farm.

172
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,900
That's it. We're back to square one.

173
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,540
Wait a minute.

174
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,420
Ridley, make another note, would you?

175
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,660
Must be something wrong
with the Mach meter.

176
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,500
Jumped plumb off the scale.

177
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,780
Gone screwy on me.

178
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,180
You bust it, we'll fix it.

179
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,780
Personally, I think you're seeing things.

180
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,820
Could be. I'm still going upstairs
like a bat out of hell.

181
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,740
We did it!

182
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,700
We finally broke the sound barrier.

183
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,540
We did it!

184
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,620
I want to place a long-distance call
to Los Angeles.

185
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,020
Who are you calling?

186
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
The press!

187
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,620
This is big news.
The sound barrier's been broken.

188
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,380
No, sir. No press.

189
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,260
No word of this is to go
beyond the flight line.

190
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,060
What's going on? This is big news.
We need coverage of this.

191
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,980
No, sir. Sorry, no press.

192
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,460
Those are orders. National security.

193
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,020
But the war's over!

194
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,380
Look, pal, maybe they don't want
someone to know.

195
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,700
Who?

196
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,540
The Russians, maybe.

197
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,820
But they're our allies!

198
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,940
Well, anyway, someone figured it out
that way, and that's the way it is.

199
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,540
Chuck, you're our man!

200
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,100
You're the fastest man alive!

201
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,060
We want you to fly more planes for us.

202
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,620
We want you to fly all our planes!

203
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,580
What you been doing, hedgehopping?

204
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,940
Word will get out, Major.

205
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,620
Maybe not to the press
or the general public.

206
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,980
But soon, every fighter jock, rocket ace,
and rat-racer in the country...

207
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,580
will be headed this way, wanting
to push the outside of the envelope...

208
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,900
and get to the top of the pyramid.

209
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,340
Edwards Air Force Base.

210
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,300
This is the place to be, hon.

211
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,740
They're going faster, farther
and higher here than anywhere else.

212
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,220
I'll tell you something else, too.

213
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,820
We'll climb right up that ladder,
just like we did at Langley.

214
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,620
We?

215
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,020
You mean you.

216
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,580
Hon, we're a team!

217
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,860
I move up, you move up.

218
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,580
Right to the top of the old pyramid.

219
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,500
Slow down, Gordo.

220
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,900
Come on now, you're scaring the girls.

221
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,060
You're scaring the girls. You are!

222
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,860
Come on, Trudy.

223
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,540
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

224
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,580
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

225
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,700
You're looking at him, baby.

226
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,340
Come on, cheer up.

227
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,620
Hey, have I ever let you down?

228
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,020
Hi there, pops.

229
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,980
Pancho's, eh? Damn, look who's here.

230
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,620
Deke, that's 62 men...

231
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,940
in the last 36 weeks.

232
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,380
You know what that averages?

233
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,500
Is that Gus Grissom from Langley Field?

234
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,660
What is an ace like you
doing in a place like this?

235
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,780
Well, if it ain't Hot Dog.

236
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,900
Gordo...

237
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,420
- Cooper, right?
- Yeah.

238
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,060
Gordo thinks he's one of those
hot-dog pilots you hear so much about.

239
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,100
You got a short memory.

240
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,620
I am not one of them hot-dog pilots.
I am the Hot Dog Man himself.

241
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,940
I guess you're too shy to tell this guy
how I used to wax your tail.

242
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,780
Wax my tail?

243
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,780
Hot Dog, you were just in my shadow.

244
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,500
That's where you'll always be.

245
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,020
What are you two rookies going to have?

246
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
Rookies?

247
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,300
Now hold on, sis.

248
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,220
You are looking
at a whole new ballgame here now.

249
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,420
In a few years I bet you're even
going to immortalize us...

250
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,260
by putting our pictures up there
on your wall.

251
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,020
Did I say something wrong?

252
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,860
I'll tell you. We got two categories
of pilots around here.

253
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,540
We got your prime pilots
that get all the hot planes.

254
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,540
And we got your pudknockers
who dream about getting the hot planes.

255
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,660
Now what are you two pudknockers
going to have?

256
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,900
Scotch.

257
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,580
You know what happened!
The machine broke.

258
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,060
It didn't, it's the man.
He was dead before he went up.

259
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,220
Don't talk about it here.

260
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,460
Good one. Now fire it in here.

261
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,420
Look at old Yeager.

262
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,340
On top of the pyramid
for five goddamn years.

263
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,980
Every time somebody goes faster,
he just goes up again.

264
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,380
He stays the fastest man alive.

265
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,860
You know...

266
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,700
sometimes...

267
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,660
all it takes is just the sound
of a truck starting.

268
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,300
I think:

269
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,660
"That's the crash truck."

270
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,180
Anyway...

271
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,020
I'm really glad we could talk.

272
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,700
I thought I was the only one
who had these nightmares.

273
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,340
Yeah. Me, too.

274
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,460
Nobody ever wants to talk
about anything around here.

275
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,700
Everybody's always trying to...

276
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,700
"maintain an even strain."

277
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,580
Well, you marry a fighter jock
and you marry the military.

278
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,620
I'll tell you one thing.

279
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,660
The military owes me for all this.

280
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,540
One day I expect the military
to make good.

281
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,380
Well, it sure ain't your average dull life.

282
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,660
I went East for a reunion...

283
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,940
and all my friends could talk about
was their husbands' work.

284
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,260
How dog-eat-dog and cutthroat it was
on Madison Avenue...

285
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,700
places like that.

286
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,340
Cutthroat?

287
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,660
I wondered how they would have felt...

288
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,620
if each time their husband
went in to make a deal...

289
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,740
there was a one in four chance
he wouldn't come out of the meeting.

290
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,300
I'm going home to my folks in San Diego.

291
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,780
What did Gordo say?

292
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,260
He "maintained an even strain."

293
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,020
Look at them.

294
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,060
You'd think they were talking
about sports.

295
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,820
Men...

296
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,180
Sometimes they're just such... assholes.

297
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,460
Sometimes they sure are
handy assholes, though.

298
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,540
Yeah, sometimes...

299
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,100
Sometimes.

300
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,140
You want a hot dog?

301
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,180
I'm leaving, Gordo.

302
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,700
Look at that!

303
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,740
Yeah, that's the D-558 Phase Two.

304
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,580
Scott Crossfield.

305
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,260
It sure as hell is. Jesus!

306
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
He scorched that one, didn't he?

307
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,020
He's pushing the outside of the envelope.

308
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,020
He must be going for a record.

309
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,180
He's shooting for Mach 2, I heard.

310
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,020
On the 50th anniversary
of the Wright Brothers' historic flight...

311
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,780
another historic flight takes place
as Scott Crossfield...

312
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,860
streaks across the skies
over the high desert in California.

313
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,260
Mach 2.

314
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,180
Almost 1,500 miles per hour...

315
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,540
and a new world record!

316
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,940
It's a field day for the press.

317
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,660
Congratulations come
from a previous record holder...

318
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,220
as he shakes the hand
of the fastest man alive, Scott Crossfield.

319
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,500
And there's a comradeship of speed.

320
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,620
To Scott Crossfield, the fastest man alive.

321
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
To the D-558 Phase Two.

322
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,140
I'll tell you a quick one.

323
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,020
The one about the newlyweds...

324
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,100
who didn't know the difference
between Vaseline and putty.

325
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,460
All their windows fell out.

326
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,340
Compliments of Pancho's, Scotty.

327
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,340
The real test wasn't Mach 2.

328
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,500
I guess that demon lives out
at about 2.3 on your Mach meter.

329
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,980
Yeah, but Mach 2 was the magic number.

330
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,740
Like 60 homers, like batting.400,
like the four-minute mile.

331
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,500
The press likes a nice round number.

332
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,780
After that, they don't care,
until the next magic number.

333
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,380
You need more than speed records.
You need coverage.

334
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,860
Coverage?

335
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,620
You mean them root weevils
that crawl around popping off cameras?

336
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,900
Those root weevils write history.

337
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,860
Let them write the history,
and let the pilots fly the planes.

338
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,580
Pilots.

339
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,660
You know what really makes
your rocket ships go up?

340
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,180
The aerodynamics would take
so long to explain to you that...

341
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Funding.

342
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,420
That's what makes your ships go up.

343
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,100
I'll tell you something.

344
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,180
And you guys, too.

345
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,220
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

346
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,420
Whoever gets the funding
gets the technology.

347
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,340
Whoever gets the technology stays on top.

348
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,060
Flyboy, let's dance.

349
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,300
I'll drink to that.

350
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,220
He'll be going after Crossfield soon,
won't he?

351
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,860
No, he won't.

352
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,180
He'll be going after that demon
that lives in the thin air.

353
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,540
You got any Beemans?

354
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,340
Even before you hit Mach 2,
she'll be unforgiving on you.

355
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,300
So take it easy.
Wring her out a little bit this time.

356
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,380
You got any gum?

357
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,820
Yeah, I got me a stick.

358
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,180
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

359
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,060
- Fair enough.
- Thank you.

360
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,580
Okay, drop her.

361
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,860
All right, here we go again.

362
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,860
Drop!

363
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,660
Number 3 coming on.

364
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,100
Got seven seconds on 150 right now.

365
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,820
I've got you in sight, Chuck.

366
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,020
Going out of sight...

367
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,540
now!

368
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,340
Mach 1.

369
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,500
Number 4.

370
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,780
Here goes Mach 2.

371
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,420
2. 1.

372
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,900
Sorry, Scotty.

373
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,860
You got her now, buddy.

374
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,500
You can ease it back.

375
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,700
Bring it on in.

376
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,540
I'm pushing the envelope.

377
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,540
See where that demon lives.

378
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,020
Come in, Chuck.

379
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,420
Say again. Over.

380
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,260
Do you read? Over.

381
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,180
Damn! He's uncorked it!

382
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,300
Mayday! Mayday!

383
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,220
Alert all ground crews.

384
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,300
Talk to me!

385
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,740
Mayday! Mayday! Alert the ground crews.

386
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,860
Come in!

387
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,340
Do you read me? Over.

388
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,220
I'm fighting bad here.

389
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,020
I'm down to 25,000 over Tehachapi.

390
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,380
I don't know if I can make it
back to base or not.

391
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,820
What happened?

392
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,540
Think I must have bust the canopy
with my head.

393
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,380
I'm getting okay now.

394
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,940
We sure chased that old demon this time.

395
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,860
That's as fast as a man can go.

396
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,300
What's next, Ridley?

397
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,780
It's called Sputnik.

398
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,740
We know. Sit down.

399
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,260
And as I was saying...

400
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,420
whoever controls
the high ground of space...

401
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,660
will control the world.

402
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,300
The Roman Empire controlled
the world because it could build roads.

403
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,300
Later, the British Empire was dominant
because it had ships.

404
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,380
In the air stage, we were powerful
because we had the airplane.

405
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,220
Now the Communists have established
a foothold in outer space.

406
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,180
Soon they'll have space platforms
to drop nuclear bombs on us...

407
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,500
like rocks from a highway overpass.

408
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,860
How the hell did they get ahead of us?

409
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,980
Gentlemen, I think we're ready.

410
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,780
Is there a loose plug over there anywhere?

411
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,060
Here it is. I'll get it.

412
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,860
Senator Johnson's right.
This is Armageddon.

413
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,940
The decisive battle
between the forces of good and evil.

414
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,740
We're engaged in a struggle for survival.

415
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,260
This footage was assembled from...

416
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,220
sources operating under deep cover
at great risk.

417
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,300
Very great!

418
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,780
We're fortunate this material
did not perish with a couple of men.

419
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,980
This is secret footage
of the Russian Korabl rocket...

420
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,780
and these are the German scientists
that they captured after the war.

421
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,860
Was it their German scientists
who got them up there first?

422
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,300
No, it was not, Senator.

423
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,060
Our Germans are better
than their Germans.

424
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,580
That's Titov on the right
and on the left is Gagarin.

425
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,420
No, Titov's on the left.
Gagarin's on the right.

426
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,540
They bear a great resemblance
to each other.

427
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,060
If the Soviets ever do put a man up there,
it will be one of these two.

428
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,140
Most likely, the one on the left.

429
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,500
- Gagarin.
- Titov.

430
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,540
Isn't that their chief designer?

431
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,180
We know very little about him.

432
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,700
- Let us see him again.
- Here's some more of him.

433
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,740
They've developed a program
of stupendous dimensions...

434
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,300
and he is clearly the genius behind it.

435
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,700
I, for one, do not intend to go to sleep...

436
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,260
by the light of a Communist moon.

437
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,940
Get that moron off of there!

438
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,580
We could have orbited
a satellite a year ago...

439
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,700
if we had been given a green light.

440
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,380
Now we must get something up there
quick and dirty, any way at all.

441
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,620
Well, what?

442
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,700
By combining our available rockets,
the Redstone, the Atlas...

443
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,260
I agree that we could launch a pod.

444
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,260
A pot?

445
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,420
A pod.

446
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,140
A capsule.

447
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,780
Now, we will be in full control of this pod.

448
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,140
It will go up like a cannonball...

449
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,660
and come down like a cannonball...

450
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,380
splashing down in the ocean...

451
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,900
with a parachute to spare the life
of the "specimen" inside.

452
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,140
Spaceman?

453
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,620
"Specimen."

454
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,900
Well, what kind of "specimen"?

455
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,460
A tough one.

456
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,220
Responsive to orders.

457
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,220
I had in mind a chimp.

458
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,820
"Jimp"?

459
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,940
Well, what the hell is a "jimp"?

460
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,540
A chimp. A chimpanzee, Senator. An ape.

461
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,900
The first American into space
is not going to be a chimpanzee.

462
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,100
Who would you put into space,
Mr. President?

463
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,020
We have film of some people
we think are strong candidates.

464
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,180
We'd like to run it by you
and stimulate some thinking.

465
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:12,300
These are people we felt
would be excellent in the splashdown.

466
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,300
We like the one on the right.

467
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,660
- No, on the left.
- On the right. Don't embarrass me!

468
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,100
These people are very experienced with
machinery and have their own helmets.

469
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,580
Is that a factor?

470
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,100
As you'll see...

471
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,420
they're quite comfortable
in conditions of flame.

472
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,540
Now this is personnel
who have very well-developed equilibrium.

473
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,500
Good middle ear. Also very nice people.

474
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,940
Very easy to work with.

475
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,940
With some work,
they could be very responsive to orders.

476
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,780
This is my first choice.
The man with the hood.

477
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,380
Since he works without eyesight,
his other senses are sharpened.

478
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,780
In space there'll be little need
for eyeballing at any rate.

479
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,460
The cannonball effect you mentioned...

480
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,420
We were basically thinking about...

481
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,460
putting a couple into orbit.

482
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,780
Possibly adds emotional stability.

483
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,700
This individual combines many
plus factors that we mentioned.

484
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,740
Ease with flames, comfort at heights
and agility in the splashdown phase.

485
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,100
Also, he is available as of the 15th.

486
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,180
I want test pilots!

487
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,940
Test pilots? No, you can't deal with them.

488
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,060
I'm sure we can do better
with another type of man...

489
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,940
any other type of man.

490
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,820
A more manageable type.

491
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,860
It will only complicate things.

492
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,380
With a man we must guarantee
a safe return.

493
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,340
Mr. President, I think
you'd be wise to reconsider.

494
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,820
No, Lyndon.

495
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,220
Test pilots?

496
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,100
We'll be heading for some air bases.

497
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,740
Not just some air bases.

498
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,260
The one with the great test pilots.
There's only one place to go.

499
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,900
I was there once before
and I hoped I'd never have to go back.

500
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,660
It's a god-forsaken spot on the roof
of the high desert in California.

501
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,500
A prehistoric throwback
of an airfield called Edwards.

502
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,380
They've got a weird, mad-monk squadron.

503
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,340
They live in rat shacks, terrible conditions.

504
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,660
Corrugated tin, bare bones, low rent.

505
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,260
This is the joint they hang out in.

506
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,460
Pancho's Happy Bottom Riding Club.

507
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,980
It's called Happy Bottom Riding Club?

508
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,260
How'd it get a name like that?

509
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,980
Ask Pancho.

510
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,700
- Lock up?
- Yeah.

511
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,380
We're meeting the Liaison Officer.
They are expecting us.

512
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,980
They? Who's "they"?

513
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,380
The best...

514
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,820
Give me that!

515
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,100
- The best test pilots in the world.
- Here?

516
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,140
They got some kind of brotherhood.

517
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,380
They think they got the right stuff.

518
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,540
What stuff? Heroism, bravery?

519
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,740
There any snakes around here?

520
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,300
Yeah. In the bushes.

521
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,380
Heroism and bravery are part of it.
But seems to be more to it.

522
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,380
What do they say it means?

523
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,340
They don't say anything.
They don't talk about it.

524
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,620
They don't talk about it to outsiders?

525
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,100
To each other.

526
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,180
To outsiders they say even less.

527
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,020
Anyway, they're all here.

528
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,740
Including the ace of aces himself.

529
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,900
Who's that?

530
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,860
Yeager.

531
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,740
Never heard of him.

532
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,980
These must be our gentlemen
from Washington...

533
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,020
scouting for astronauts.

534
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,300
Welcome to Edwards.

535
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,100
Scouting for lab rabbits, more likely.

536
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,540
I didn't quite hear you.

537
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,540
I said, "Lab rabbits."

538
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,860
What's that mean?

539
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,660
It means you don't need
honest-to-God pilots.

540
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,940
What you ought to get is a lab rabbit
to curl up in your damn capsule...

541
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,260
with its heart beating...

542
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,140
and a wire up the kazoo.

543
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,740
I don't hold with it.

544
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,140
I don't either.

545
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,060
You want a pilot to be a ballistic missile.

546
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,740
And then splashdown.

547
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,140
Possibly get lost at sea.

548
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,460
There's some things you can't change.

549
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,420
Some peckerwood's
got to take the beast up.

550
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,740
And some peckerwood's got to land it.

551
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,540
And that peckerwood is called a pilot.

552
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,700
You're mighty right.

553
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,340
The boys smell panic in your program.

554
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,740
That's one thing they don't respond to.

555
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,980
Now maybe if we talk privately
to Yeager and some of the other boys...

556
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,260
That's Yeager?

557
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,580
Anybody goes up in the damn thing
is gonna be Spam in a can.

558
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,260
I'll drink to that!

559
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,460
- Yeager doesn't fit the profile.
- Yeager doesn't fit?

560
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,380
He didn't go to college.
We're only taking college personnel.

561
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:50,500
Forget about Walker and Crossfield
and the other civilian pilots, too.

562
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,100
The security clearance just takes
too long with those people.

563
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,140
Besides, they seem
a little too independent.

564
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,940
You mean for this space race...

565
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,660
you don't want our best pilots?

566
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,500
I didn't say that.

567
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,140
We want the best pilots that we can get.

568
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,540
Y'all want some whiskey?

569
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,380
No, thanks, Fred. Just a little coffee.

570
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,620
- I'd like a Coca-Cola.
- Coke?

571
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,620
In a clean glass.

572
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,300
There's an old saying:
"Never refuse a combat assignment."

573
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,540
Well, there sure is a long line
of shit-hot rocket aces around here.

574
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,180
Hey, Hot Dog.

575
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,820
What the hell's "astronaut" mean anyway?

576
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,260
Star voyager.

577
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,660
Star voyager Gus Grissom.

578
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,780
I like the sound of that.

579
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,380
Now your name is?

580
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,420
My name, José Jiménez.

581
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,700
Who are we gonna get
to take on the Russians?

582
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,700
Have you seen this José Jiménez?
He's a crack-up.

583
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,460
I am the chief astronaut
of the United States Interplanetary...

584
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,100
My name, José Jiménez.

585
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,180
Now I see you have some
of your space equipment with you.

586
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,820
What is that called? The crash helmet?

587
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,740
Oh, I hope not.

588
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,420
Get that guy off.

589
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,100
The country's already laughing at us.

590
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,820
This is the show I wanted you to see.

591
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,180
Who, that kid?

592
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,500
Winner of five
Distinguished Flying Crosses...

593
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:52,060
and holder of the coast-to-coast,
nonstop, supersonic flight record...

594
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,380
from the U.S. Marine Corps...

595
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,140
Major John Glenn!

596
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,180
That guy.

597
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,620
Can you tell us what's that song?

598
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,740
Straighten Up and Fly Right.

599
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,500
It's Straighten Up and Fly Right.

600
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,460
He's not dumb.

601
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,380
Major, Eddie here has a little problem
with his girlfriend.

602
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,900
Did you ever have a problem like that
when you were ten?

603
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,820
Yes, I did, Bob.

604
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,660
I liked a girl in my class, but...

605
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,900
the other guys liked her, too,
and she didn't pay attention.

606
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,140
But I kept after her, Eddie.

607
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,420
Did you finally get her to notice you?

608
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,620
Yes, I did.

609
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,260
In fact, I finally got her to marry me.

610
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,380
They love the guy.

611
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,380
Delta Charlie 9, you are clear to land...

612
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,020
at 180 degrees.

613
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,300
José Jiménez on approach.

614
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,140
My name, José Jiménez.

615
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,820
Yeah, Shepard, I forgot.
You are clear at 180 degrees.

616
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,700
Some boys here want to talk to you
about being an astronaut.

617
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,300
They want to make me an astronaut?
Oh, I hope not.

618
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,260
Are you sure the Navy's got good pilots?

619
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:59,460
They call them aviators in the Navy.
They say they're better than pilots.

620
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,380
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet Alan Shepard.

621
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,860
What?

622
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,220
I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.

623
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,220
Just the man we came to see.

624
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,860
Well. Pleasure.

625
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,860
You've heard about our project.

626
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,140
We're going up against the Russians.
It's got the highest...

627
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,540
Priority.

628
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,340
It's a hazardous...

629
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,700
undertaking. In fact,
it's extremely hazardous.

630
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:43,500
It's so hazardous that
if you decide not to volunteer...

631
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,220
it will not be held against you in any way.

632
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,300
- Sounds dangerous.
- It is.

633
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,820
Count me in.

634
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,940
There's nothing to worry about.
Absolutely nothing.

635
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,980
Why are you doing this to me?

636
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,620
I'm afraid there's no simple way
to explain that to you.

637
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,620
Thank you, Number 21.

638
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,420
Number 22, please.

639
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,340
You're gonna love it.

640
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,820
Please. Sit right there.
Put your arm right up here.

641
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,060
Excuse me, are you John Glenn?

642
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,860
Scott Carpenter.

643
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,340
I recognize you from those TV shows.
I like them.

644
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,340
I had a good time doing them.

645
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,300
I guess we're both here
for the same reason.

646
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,740
You know what they've got planned?

647
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,820
No. Let me check it out.

648
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,020
What have you got scheduled?

649
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,180
We're not really free
to reveal all the testing.

650
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,740
I don't get this.

651
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,740
Sending us down here
disguised as civilians.

652
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,540
Come on, Gus, cut it out. What the hell.

653
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,860
Hot Dog, this entire operation's
supposed to be hush-hush.

654
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,820
We got top-secret orders to blend in
with the patients. So shut up.

655
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,580
There might be Russian agents here.

656
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,620
They don't look very Russian to me, Gus.

657
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,780
All we got here is your local gentry, and...

658
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,180
then you got Navy
and Marine pilots over here.

659
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,140
None of these guys is up
to Air Force standards.

660
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,740
I hear they got some 50-some guys
trying out for seven spots.

661
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,540
After they pick us three,
there's only gonna be four spots.

662
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,380
Sounds right to me. Where do we go next?

663
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,940
You go in that door.

664
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,460
Who are you?

665
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,700
My name, José Jiménez.

666
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,620
You talking to us, buddy?

667
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:45,100
All Air Force pilots go in that door.

668
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,900
When they all go in...

669
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,780
they all look the same.

670
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,380
But when they all come out...

671
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,140
they all look different.

672
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,860
How's that?

673
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,500
Fellow, I said how's that?

674
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,780
When they all come out...

675
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,060
they all look scared.

676
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,420
Buenos días, González.

677
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,380
Buenos días yourself.

678
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,340
Would you come this way?

679
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,220
That guy didn't fool me a bit.

680
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,980
That Mexican guy?

681
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,500
That guy's Navy all the way.
There's another swabbo.

682
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,540
I'll open the box a little so you can see.

683
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,300
Don't put your fingers in there.

684
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,900
This thing will bite them off. It's vicious.

685
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,660
Real swabbo sense of humor.

686
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,900
Let's see what there is
to be scared about back here.

687
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,660
The ball must be maintained
in the position between these two lines.

688
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,420
You may begin... now.

689
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,780
The record is 91 seconds.

690
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,260
Ninety-three seconds. Read it and weep.

691
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,020
Terrific, Scott. Darn good!

692
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,540
You were probably
just getting warmed up.

693
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,860
Next time I doubt I'd win.

694
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,420
I don't know about that.

695
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,900
We're competing with Archie and Jughead.

696
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,100
Let me out of here! Let me out!

697
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,460
Gus, I got this whole thing figured out.

698
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:41,580
The drill here...

699
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:42,940
Number 3.

700
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:48,780
The drill here is to see who can drill
the brains out of Nurse Murch.

701
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:50,860
Nineteen.

702
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,820
You're nuts.

703
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,300
She thinks we're all just
miserable pudknockers.

704
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:00,780
This is one fighter jock
who is not a miserable pudknocker.

705
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:04,740
She's a woman,
susceptible to charms like all of the rest.

706
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,420
You want what in there?

707
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,700
Sperm.

708
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,780
What for?

709
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,380
Sperm motility factors.

710
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:23,260
Yeah, but, Nurse...

711
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:25,620
how am I supposed to...

712
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:31,700
The best results seem to be obtained
through fantasization...

713
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:35,380
accompanied by masturbation,
followed by ejaculation.

714
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,220
That sounds easy enough.

715
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,340
I'll tell you what.

716
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:48,580
If I get stuck, you mind coming in
and helping me out a little bit?

717
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,060
Please return it to the lab.

718
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,060
Hey, cut out the humming in there.

719
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,300
Okay, knock it off in there.

720
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,860
Okay, Glenn, I know that's you.

721
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:04,820
Just knock it off,
because I'm trying to concentrate in here.

722
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,700
That was quick.

723
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,380
There's plenty more
where that came from.

724
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,140
You want to see me again?

725
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,100
I'd like to meet your wife.

726
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,380
My wife?

727
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:54,980
You're married, aren't you?

728
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,740
Yeah, sure, I'm married all right.

729
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,460
Happily?

730
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:04,140
Yeah. A real stable relationship, too.

731
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,460
I'd like to meet your wife.

732
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:11,020
You'd like to meet my wife?

733
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,140
Tomorrow.

734
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,460
Tomorrow?

735
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,380
Tomorrow's no good.

736
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,980
Tomorrow.

737
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,460
I need you, Trudy.

738
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,860
I'm talking about a whole new ballgame.

739
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,020
Fresh start.

740
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,140
This astronaut thing is the best way
for us to move up that ladder.

741
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:53,140
If we play our cards right,
we go all the way to the top.

742
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,660
We? You mean you.

743
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,380
I mean we.

744
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,100
We're a team.

745
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,940
Have I ever let you down?

746
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,180
Yeah.

747
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,860
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

748
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,740
You're looking at him.

749
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:56,420
You're all set. I told her you were stable,
well adjusted, attentive, persevering.

750
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,540
- I lied.
- That a girl.

751
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,980
What'd she say?

752
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,260
She laughed.

753
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,580
She knows you too well, Gordo.

754
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,300
Let's face it. Some women
just have a problem with men.

755
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,460
Yeah, I know.

756
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,660
At secret locations throughout America...

757
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,460
fifty-six of our greatest pilots
are at this moment...

758
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:26,140
vying to be one of the first men
to go into space.

759
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:29,340
These are the most up-to-date
tests imaginable.

760
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:33,100
This is the most rigorous physical testing
ever done to human beings.

761
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:40,260
They're being subjected to every stress
our doctors and engineers can invent.

762
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,980
These men are preparing themselves
for the ordeal of capsule life.

763
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:52,980
They will be guiding a new machine
through a hostile environment.

764
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:56,300
They will be faced with emergencies
no man can foresee.

765
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,700
Many are called, but few will be chosen.

766
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,660
These are men who will have to face
any danger for their country.

767
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:11,500
No individual will have ever been
so adequately prepared for an event.

768
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:16,620
Each man knows
that whoever survives this competition...

769
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,140
is destined to become
a legend in his own time.

770
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,580
Here, hold this.

771
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,980
And hold this like this.

772
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,460
When the clamp is released,
the balloon inside you deflates.

773
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,100
Deflates? Where's the john?

774
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:46,020
Two floors up. González will take
you there, but wait here with him.

775
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,860
How's it going, González?

776
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,260
Faster!

777
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,100
Good day, Commander.

778
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:44,140
You prick!

779
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:49,740
Push the button.

780
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:29,740
Me and my friends think your
José Jiménez imitation is A-okay.

781
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,540
But what you're doing with it is b-a-d.

782
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,980
You're right, you're absolutely right.

783
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:38,860
Open!

784
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:49,740
You ever have any explosions doing this?

785
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,220
All the time. It's a mess.

786
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,180
Tell me something else, Mr. González.

787
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:00,260
How am I doing?

788
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,220
I think you're gonna make it.
I think you're gonna be an astronaut.

789
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,060
After a long...

790
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,740
and unprecedented series of evaluations...

791
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,980
which told our medical scientists...

792
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:42,300
of their superb adaptability
to their upcoming flight...

793
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:46,620
it is my pleasure to introduce to you...

794
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,340
seven Americans...

795
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,700
gentlemen all.

796
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:56,220
Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom!

797
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,820
Leroy G. Cooper!

798
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,820
Donald K. Slayton!

799
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,740
John H. Glenn, Junior!

800
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,140
Malcolm S. Carpenter!

801
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,700
Alan B. Shepard, Junior!

802
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,340
Walter M. Schirra, Junior!

803
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:25,100
America's Mercury astronauts!

804
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,380
Holy shit!

805
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,380
Smile, Gus. We're heroes.

806
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:47,900
Yeager ought to see this.

807
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:51,220
Seven rookies being installed
as the hottest fliers...

808
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:55,060
and they haven't done a thing
but show up for a press conference.

809
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:07,020
Following the distribution of the kits,
those of you who have p.m. Deadlines...

810
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:09,300
better dash to your phones.

811
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:12,780
Now we'll have some questions
from the press, please.

812
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:18,660
I'd like to know
whether your wives and children...

813
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,820
had anything to say about this.

814
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:29,420
Mine think it's fine.

815
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:42,220
They're all for it.

816
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:56,740
I don't think any of us could go on
with something like this...

817
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,660
if we didn't have
pretty good backing at home.

818
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:07,940
My wife's attitude towards this
has been the same...

819
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,540
as it's been all along through my flying.

820
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:14,020
If it's what I want to do, she's behind it.

821
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,260
And, by golly, my kids are, too.
100 percent.

822
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,180
I don't believe this.

823
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:30,580
But look at them out there.
They're eating it up.

824
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,780
I was brought up believing
that you are placed on Earth...

825
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,900
more or less with a 50-50 proposition.

826
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,620
This is what I still believe.

827
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:46,940
We're placed here with certain talents
and capabilities...

828
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:51,140
and it's up to each one of us
to use those talents as best we can.

829
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,740
And if we use our talents properly...

830
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:01,260
I think there is a power
greater than us that will place...

831
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,500
the opportunities in our way.

832
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:12,620
When I think of Orville
and Wilbur Wright...

833
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,260
standing on a hill
at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina...

834
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:19,340
tossing a coin to see which one
would take the first airplane flight...

835
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,260
and then I think of us here today...

836
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,180
I thank God I live in a country...

837
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,380
where the best and finest in a man
can be brought out.

838
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:50,060
I'd like to second some of the things
Mr. Glenn has said here.

839
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:55,220
I think that we are all very,
very fortunate...

840
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:59,140
that we have been,
should we say, "blessed"...

841
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,020
with the talents for something like this.

842
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:06,340
And I think that we would be most remiss
in our duty indeed...

843
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:10,380
if we did not volunteer
for something as important as this is...

844
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,180
for our country...

845
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,860
and to the world in general right now.

846
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,820
One of our Air Force boys.

847
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:24,340
Don't you agree, Deke?

848
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,540
I absolutely agree with Gordo.

849
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,260
But we're not saying anything new.

850
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,140
We're just saying the same things...

851
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:37,340
that need to be said again
and again with fierce conviction.

852
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:48,500
Can you tell us if any of you
go to church regularly?

853
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:51,780
As far as church goes...

854
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,140
I attend regularly.

855
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,820
Which one of you will be
the first into space?

856
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:19,860
The best will be first.

857
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,740
Share it, brother.

858
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,300
Fucking A, bubba.

859
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,700
This is for America's Life magazine.

860
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:58,060
These are the greatest pilots in America.

861
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,260
How much do they make?

862
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,700
$7,000-$8,000 a year?

863
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:06,020
- Tops.
- At the most.

864
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:09,980
With this one deal
I'm giving them $500,000...

865
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,460
split seven ways over three years.

866
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:14,940
How does that sound?

867
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:20,900
Now I want them all to meet my people
who will write their true stories.

868
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:24,780
These stories will appear in Life
under their own by-lines.

869
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,460
For example...

870
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:29,180
"by Betty Grissom..."

871
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,060
or, "by...

872
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,420
"Virgil I. Grissom."

873
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,860
- Or...
- Gus.

874
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,580
What was that?

875
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,660
Gus.

876
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:43,540
Nobody calls me by that other name.

877
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:45,540
Gus?

878
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,580
An astronaut named Gus?

879
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,380
What's your middle name?

880
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,420
Ivan.

881
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:00,700
Maybe...

882
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,220
"Gus" isn't so bad.

883
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,180
Might be something there.

884
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,620
All right, you can be Gus.

885
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:17,660
I bet for all that money
they could call you Virgil.

886
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,580
They sure could me.

887
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:27,580
Well, what's with her?

888
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:30,300
She seems snobby.

889
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,340
I don't get it.

890
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,660
I get it. She's "Mrs. Clean Marine."

891
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,220
I'm going to the Cape tomorrow.

892
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,860
I wish to heck it wasn't off-limits to wives.

893
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:01,660
There's so much work to do, anyway.
More tests...

894
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,780
training...

895
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,980
studying.

896
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,580
What about after?

897
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,900
After hours I'll run a lot.

898
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,820
I'm going to get up to five miles a day.

899
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:24,580
There's a beautiful, long beach there.

900
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,860
It's called Cocoa Beach.

901
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,540
You can run forever.

902
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,700
Scott Carpenter will run with me.

903
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,620
He's a good guy.

904
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,020
He's real philosophical.

905
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,980
What about...

906
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:49,980
The others want to get the job done and
keep the Mickey Mouse to a minimum.

907
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,340
They're good men.

908
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,220
Good men.

909
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,900
They'll give 100 percent
when the time comes.

910
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,740
Guess they think I'm kind of a...

911
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,100
gung-ho type.

912
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,260
"Eddie Attaboy."

913
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,620
"Harry Hair-shirt."

914
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,580
What, you agree?

915
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:27,700
You agree?

916
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,060
My own wife.

917
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:32,900
Do you think I'm a "Dudley Do-right"?

918
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,460
That's me, I guess.

919
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,420
A lonely beacon of restraint...

920
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,220
and self-sacrifice in a squall of car-crazies.

921
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:01,300
It's important to America
to get a man up there first.

922
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,740
I plan to be the first man
to ride the rocket.

923
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:43,660
Four, three, two, one. Ignition.

924
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:56,100
What is the most important thing
in rocket travel?

925
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:58,820
To me the most important thing...

926
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:01,220
is the blast-off.

927
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:04,380
I always take a blast before I take off.

928
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,500
Otherwise I wouldn't go near that thing.

929
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,260
He loves Ed Sullivan.

930
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:49,580
Four down, three to go.

931
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,420
I don't want anything to put this program
in a bad light.

932
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:35,620
We have the opportunity of a lifetime
and I'm sorry, but I won't stand by...

933
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:38,660
and let other people compromise
the whole darned thing!

934
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:42,300
You know and I know this could lead
to something very unfortunate.

935
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:45,620
I'm talking about the playing around
that's going on.

936
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:48,260
I'm talking about the young girls.

937
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,100
I'm talking about the cookies.

938
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:53,300
I'm talking about keeping our pants zipped
and our wicks dry.

939
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:55,820
Mr. Glenn, you are way out of line.

940
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:01,020
I advise you not to try to foist your
moral views on anyone else in this group.

941
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:03,500
Each man here has volunteered
to do a job.

942
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:06,420
Each man is devoting long hours
of training...

943
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:09,620
and doing many things
above and beyond the call of duty...

944
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:11,660
such as morale tours of factories...

945
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:13,780
Such as bringing girls up to your room?

946
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,300
And forgoing any orderly family life.

947
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:19,220
Mr. Glenn, as long as
a man uses good sense...

948
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:22,100
what he does with his wick
is his own business!

949
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:26,100
I'm from Life magazine.
I'm not with these people.

950
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:29,220
You can't go in.
They're discussing scientific problems.

951
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:36,540
John's right. Whether we like it or not
we're public figures.

952
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,220
Whether we deserve it or not,
people look up to us.

953
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,540
We have a tremendous responsibility.

954
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:44,660
You can't tell a pilot what to do
when he's not flying.

955
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,500
Wait a minute. You got it all wrong.

956
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,380
The issue here ain't pussy.

957
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:55,460
The issue here is monkey.

958
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:59,500
- What?
- Us. We are the monkey.

959
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:04,460
What Gus is saying is
that we're missing the point.

960
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:08,620
Gus is saying that we all heard rumors
they want to send a monkey up first.

961
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:12,100
None of us wants them to send
a monkey up to do a man's work.

962
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,900
What Gus is saying is that...

963
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:17,860
what they're trying to do to us
is send a man up to do a monkey's work.

964
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,700
Us. A bunch of
college-trained chimpanzees.

965
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:24,500
What Gus is saying is that
we've got to change things around here.

966
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,540
He's saying that we are pilots.

967
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:30,300
We know more about what we need
to fly than anybody else.

968
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:33,020
So what we have to do
is alter the experiment.

969
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:36,900
It comes down to who is going
to control this thing from here on.

970
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:40,620
What Gus is saying here is
that we've got to stick together on this.

971
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,140
These tests were designed...

972
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:51,020
to decondition, to desensitize...

973
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,460
to adapt out fears.

974
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:58,340
Since we have developed
a fully automated vehicle...

975
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:01,300
all we seek from the occupants...

976
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:03,220
of the capsule is data.

977
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:06,340
The so-called astronaut...

978
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:09,580
would merely be a redundant component.

979
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,900
And here you can see...

980
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:17,340
these chimps are capable of many
of the same tasks as men.

981
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:19,580
And they are much more cooperative.

982
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:27,420
They are being put through every phase
of the astronaut training.

983
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:31,100
As far as we are concerned,
the question still remains:

984
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,180
Which one will be first?

985
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:34,660
The man or...

986
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:36,100
the monkey?

987
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:38,260
We shall see.

988
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,900
Take it easy with that.

989
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:20,900
- Where are you putting the window?
- Window?

990
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:22,460
There is no window.

991
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:23,620
No window?

992
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:26,460
What about the hatch?

993
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:30,900
We need a hatch with explosive bolts,
that we can open ourselves.

994
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,380
There's something you don't understand.

995
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,780
This is the final form of the capsule.

996
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,100
No hatch.

997
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:40,140
What would happen
if the automatic controls went out?

998
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:43,260
With backups, checks,
this would not happen.

999
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,820
I said, what would happen if it did?

1000
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,700
The pilot would have to fly it back.

1001
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:49,500
This is the way it is.

1002
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,780
I wonder how the press
will feel about this.

1003
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:57,020
The press? What does the press
have to say about this?

1004
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:01,660
Do you boys know
what makes this bird go up?

1005
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,660
Funding makes this bird go up.

1006
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:06,780
That's right. No bucks...

1007
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:09,140
no Buck Rogers.

1008
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,780
And the press over there...

1009
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:21,100
They all want to see Buck Rogers.

1010
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:22,420
And that's us.

1011
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:24,380
Buck Rogers.

1012
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:27,900
You see, those fellows over there
have been making us out...

1013
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:31,100
as the seven finest and bravest pilots
in all America.

1014
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,580
If the story would come out in the press...

1015
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,020
that we are not allowed to fly as pilots...

1016
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,580
We want a window.

1017
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:44,660
There could maybe be...

1018
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:47,940
in future capsules a window...

1019
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:50,660
here.

1020
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,820
No, that's where the hatch
with explosive bolts goes.

1021
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,860
The hatch with the explosive...

1022
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:02,500
There could be a hatch
with explosive bolts on the capsule.

1023
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,580
That is a spacecraft, sir.

1024
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:07,700
We do not refer to it as a "capsule."

1025
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:11,220
Spacecraft.

1026
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:16,100
A hatch with explosive bolts on the...

1027
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:18,100
spacecraft.

1028
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:24,500
And there will be pitch and yaw thrusters
to enable the occupant...

1029
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,620
The pilot.

1030
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,020
Astronaut-pilot?

1031
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:33,380
The astronaut...

1032
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:35,500
pilot...

1033
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:38,580
to have some...

1034
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,420
To have...

1035
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:44,780
control...

1036
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:49,140
of the re-entry procedures.

1037
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:55,180
We appreciate it.

1038
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:59,460
You wouldn't mind if we had the press
take a few photos of us, would you?

1039
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:35,700
Which one of you is going to be
the first one to be launched into space?

1040
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,420
Here he is.

1041
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:14,780
Captain Ham.

1042
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:19,300
Grinning like a possum
eating a sweet potato.

1043
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:25,460
Does he look like the kind of guy
who'd put doo-doo in the capsule?

1044
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:27,700
Ham in a can.

1045
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,420
America's first astronaut. Look at him!

1046
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:37,740
You take a monkey like this,
you can make him a democrat, a politician.

1047
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:42,660
I think he's better looking than Crossfield.

1048
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:48,460
How would you like to go up
with this guy as your copilot?

1049
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:57,300
They've got a man up there. It's Gagarin.

1050
01:39:57,380 --> 01:39:58,820
We know. Sit down.

1051
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,540
All right, give them a break.

1052
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:42,340
Is it true you were ready to go
and the flight was cancelled?

1053
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:44,580
Is it true we could've beaten the Russians?

1054
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:47,740
Why didn't we send a man up
instead of a monkey?

1055
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:50,940
I think we ought to be...

1056
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:54,260
forthright, gracious,
and magnanimous and say...

1057
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:56,980
the Russians beat the pants off us.

1058
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,140
No sense in kidding ourselves about it.

1059
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:02,180
But the space age has begun,
and there's plenty of work.

1060
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:04,420
Who will be the second man in space?

1061
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:08,500
You mean who will be
the first free man into space?

1062
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,780
We know it'll be Glenn. Just tell us when.

1063
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:13,140
That's a secret.

1064
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:17,620
I'm tired of being "forthright,
gracious, and magnanimous."

1065
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:20,660
I'm tired of stupid questions
from the press.

1066
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:23,940
I'm tired of smocks,
of engineers telling us what we can't do.

1067
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,500
I'm tired of everybody saying
we are not pilots.

1068
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,180
I'm tired of monkeys.

1069
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:31,860
Most of all, I'm sick and tired
of being second to those...

1070
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:35,060
those darned Russians. It's time we...

1071
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:36,700
Got someone up there!

1072
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:39,860
Fucking A, bubba.

1073
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:41,540
- Exactly.
- Let's talk to them.

1074
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:43,340
Let's get this thing on the road.

1075
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,260
I'm tired of messing around.

1076
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,140
We'll just tell 'em we're ready.
We're ready to go.

1077
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:28,740
In these three weeks since the Russian
Gagarin's flight surprised everybody...

1078
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:31,300
one wretched event has followed another.

1079
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:34,180
People have begun to say
our rockets always blow up...

1080
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:36,380
our boys always botch it.

1081
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:41,540
Some say this is not the time to try
desperate deeds to beat the Soviets.

1082
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:42,940
The question really is:

1083
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:46,180
Are we actually ready
to launch a man into space?

1084
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:50,060
And yet out here at this very moment
sits a rocket, waiting in the night.

1085
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:53,340
Soon, one American astronaut
will climb atop that rocket...

1086
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:57,020
in what may be the greatest
death-defying stunt ever broadcast.

1087
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:03,540
The identity of America's first astronaut
has been kept a secret...

1088
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:05,540
until almost the final moment.

1089
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:09,100
The question everyone has asked is:
Which one will be first?

1090
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:39,620
Not very funny, John.

1091
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:44,020
But I do appreciate it, John.

1092
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,060
I surely do.

1093
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:50,380
Vaya con Dios, José.

1094
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:02,900
Dear Lord, please don't let me fuck up.

1095
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:05,780
I didn't quite copy that. Say again, please.

1096
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:10,020
I said, everything's A-okay.

1097
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:12,460
Well, that's what I thought you said.

1098
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:16,340
He said everything is A-okay.

1099
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:20,780
He says everything is A-okay.
And there you have it.

1100
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:33,220
Roger. Auto retro-jettison switch.

1101
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:37,380
Retro-heater switch... off.

1102
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:41,060
Retro-heater switch... off.

1103
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:43,940
Landing-bag switch... auto.

1104
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:48,500
Roger. Landing-bag switch... auto.

1105
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:52,620
This is it, ladies. This is for Life magazine.

1106
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:59,060
My God! They're going
after the diaper-service man.

1107
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:03,300
Stop that! Stop it!

1108
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:08,140
We don't have a diaper-service man.

1109
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,820
Get back from the door.
I don't know them, really.

1110
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:13,580
Oh, Louise, your lawn!

1111
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:15,820
Leave those diapers alone!

1112
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,220
Shut that door!

1113
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:20,820
Why are they here?

1114
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:22,380
What do they want?

1115
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:25,140
We are here live at the house
of Louise Shepard...

1116
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:28,660
wife of Astronaut Al Shepard,
who is about to go into space.

1117
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:36,620
Wanted to keep you informed,
Mrs. Shepard.

1118
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:39,180
Everything's A-okay.
Nothing to worry about.

1119
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:40,540
Just some delays.

1120
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:42,660
What kind of delays?

1121
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,860
There's another hold from NASA,
another delay.

1122
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:49,060
And Alan Shepard sits there
patiently waiting.

1123
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:52,380
What can be going through
a man's mind at this moment?

1124
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,460
I have to urinate.

1125
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:03,660
Urinate?

1126
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:08,100
Urinate? No. We did not think of that.

1127
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,500
This is only a 15-minute flight.

1128
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:12,700
The man's been up there for hours.

1129
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:14,460
Could he do it in his suit?

1130
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:17,100
It might be dangerous.
To introduce liquid...

1131
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:21,060
into the pure oxygen of the capsule
and the pressure suit...

1132
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,260
might cause a short circuit.
It could start a fire.

1133
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:26,020
No. Tell him he cannot.

1134
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:34,140
Listen, old buddy, they promise
we'll stop at the next gas station.

1135
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:38,140
Request that you remain
in a holding pattern till then.

1136
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:52,020
- You sure you just want a little smidgen?
- About a half a cup.

1137
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:54,020
- And nothing in it?
- That's fine.

1138
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:55,180
All right.

1139
01:47:57,260 --> 01:48:00,820
Alan had four cups of coffee
before he went to work this morning.

1140
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:10,100
All this waiting is driving me crazy.

1141
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:15,060
I had a little accident.

1142
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:35,220
Request permission to relieve bladder.

1143
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,380
Look, the man has got to go.

1144
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:52,660
It's either that or we get the lug wrench
and pry him out.

1145
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:55,380
Do it in the suit.

1146
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:02,380
José, permission granted...

1147
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,700
to wet your diapers anytime, son.

1148
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:19,700
Suit thermometer says
Freon flow jumping from 30 to 45.

1149
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,940
Left lower-chest sensor.

1150
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,340
No short-out. Moving up back.

1151
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,380
Well...

1152
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,380
I'm a wetback now.

1153
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,780
It is questionable if we can proceed.

1154
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:44,180
I'm cooler than you are. Why don't you
fix your problems and light this candle!

1155
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:46,900
He's right! Let's light this candle!

1156
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:49,140
He surely is! Light the candle!

1157
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:51,980
Resume the countdown.

1158
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:54,940
All systems go.

1159
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:01,380
T minus ten seconds...

1160
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,140
nine, eight, seven...

1161
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:12,660
Ignition.

1162
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:22,540
You're on your way, José.

1163
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:25,740
We have liftoff, and the clock is operating.

1164
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:37,620
I think we'll be able to talk
to one of the astronauts' wives...

1165
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:39,820
if not to Louise Shepard herself.

1166
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:08,740
He has re-entered the Earth's atmosphere
and the g-forces should be building up.

1167
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:11,020
Louise, he's coming down!

1168
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:15,020
We almost missed this.

1169
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,580
Eight.

1170
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:23,540
That's nine.

1171
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:25,820
I'm okay!

1172
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:17,580
The Vice President,
who is Chairman of our Space Council...

1173
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:20,540
and who bears great responsibilities
in this field...

1174
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:22,900
the members of the House and Senate...

1175
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:25,940
Space Committee,
who are here today to award you...

1176
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:30,460
this decoration,
which has gone from the ground up.

1177
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:55,980
What was Jackie like?

1178
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,260
She's very nice.

1179
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:00,540
We talked about all kinds of things.

1180
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:02,180
My Gus goes up next.

1181
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:04,620
I can't wait to talk to Jackie after that.

1182
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:07,900
You'll love her. She's so nice.
We talked about the kids.

1183
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:27,460
Mr. Shepard, sign here.

1184
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:34,260
I never realized...

1185
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:39,340
a gruff, mean son of a bitch like you
could be so popular.

1186
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:43,180
How'd you get to go up before me?

1187
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:45,620
Even before "Mr. Clean, the Marine."

1188
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:48,580
Charm, Hot Dog. Pure charm.

1189
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:50,740
Watch this.

1190
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:54,500
Hey, sis, how are you doing?

1191
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:56,260
So-so. How are you doing?

1192
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:58,140
I ain't doing anymore.

1193
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:01,300
Damn thing's dragging in the mud,
and I can't get it up.

1194
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:04,020
Charm, Gus, that's pure charm.

1195
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:08,860
How'd you like one of these?

1196
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:11,980
I can get one of those from a dime store.

1197
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:14,420
Not one that's been in outer space.

1198
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:17,260
I'm taking these up with me tomorrow.

1199
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:21,420
Would you like a souvenir
after I get written in history?

1200
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:24,460
Well, I might, if it's been in outer space.

1201
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:27,180
See you after outer space.

1202
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:40,140
You got to think ahead to the future.

1203
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:43,700
Folks have a taste for things
that have been there.

1204
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:50,780
I'll give you one of these dimes
I'm taking up so you can play with it...

1205
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:54,260
and dream about outer space.

1206
01:54:56,740 --> 01:55:00,140
Why don't you just make sure
you don't screw the pooch?

1207
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:05,940
Oh, God, look at this.

1208
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:15,580
Go get 'em, Deke!

1209
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:29,460
Grissom has just reached the apex
of his flight into outer space...

1210
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:32,020
and will be coming down
with the valuable data...

1211
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:35,420
needed for the future flights
that will actually orbit the Earth.

1212
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:38,220
He will be re-entering
the atmosphere now.

1213
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:22,460
Liberty Bell 7, Liberty Bell 7,
this is Hunt Club 1. Over.

1214
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:25,820
We're in orbit at this time
around the capsule.

1215
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:31,260
Are you ready to come in and hook on?

1216
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:34,820
Roger. This is Hunt Club 1...

1217
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:37,580
waiting for your okay
to come in and hook on.

1218
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:47,060
Roger. I've unplugged my suit,
so I'm kind of warm now.

1219
01:56:48,980 --> 01:56:50,740
Hunt Club 1. Roger.

1220
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,380
One, roger.

1221
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:55,580
Roger. Blow the hatch after we hook on.

1222
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:59,540
All right, get ready.
Another 15 feet to the right.

1223
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:05,700
If you're ready for me to blow the hatch...

1224
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:08,340
I'll take my helmet off.

1225
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:11,500
Say again, Liberty Bell.

1226
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:13,940
Waiting for your okay to hook on.

1227
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:19,380
Who designed this?

1228
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:23,220
Say again, Liberty Bell. We can't hear you.

1229
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:24,820
I can't get it off.

1230
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,940
Liberty Bell, say again.

1231
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:32,580
This is Hunt Club 1, waiting for your okay.

1232
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:40,500
What happened?

1233
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:46,420
It's all right. He's okay. Go for the capsule.

1234
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:48,340
Help, I'm sinking!

1235
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:52,300
Get the capsule. He can float in that suit.

1236
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:58,180
We need the data in the capsule.

1237
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:00,020
Throw down a line!

1238
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:12,340
Help! Throw down the line!

1239
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:16,740
Hey, I'm sinking!

1240
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:18,820
Forget the fucking capsule!

1241
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:25,220
We can't pull it. It's full of water.

1242
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:28,580
Hey! Help me over here!

1243
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:35,540
We've lost it!

1244
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:37,060
Blow the cable!

1245
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:42,860
Come back here, damn it!

1246
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:54,980
Throw a line down.

1247
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:51,540
I didn't do anything.

1248
01:59:52,740 --> 01:59:54,380
I was just lying there.

1249
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:56,420
It just blew.

1250
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:01,860
The hatch just blew.

1251
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:16,860
It must have been a technical malfunction.

1252
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:20,460
The capsule was rocking around a bit.

1253
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:24,540
There were no loose items. I don't see
how I could have hit that button.

1254
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:28,980
I was just lying there, flat on my back...

1255
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:30,340
and it just blew.

1256
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:45,020
Well, what do you think?

1257
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:52,180
Explosive hatches have been
on jet fighters for ten years.

1258
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:55,060
The things have been wrung inside out...

1259
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:59,380
subjected to trial by heat,
by water, by shaking, pounding.

1260
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:04,620
We even drop them from a height
of 100 feet onto concrete...

1261
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:09,140
and not one of them has ever "just blown."

1262
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:21,100
- Are we going to the White House?
- No.

1263
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:24,940
Isn't the President coming?

1264
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:32,780
No ticker-tape parade in New York?

1265
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:37,580
Not even one in Mitchell, Indiana?

1266
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:44,300
No Jackie?

1267
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,340
By order of the President
of the United States...

1268
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:59,700
the Distinguished Service Medal...

1269
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:03,980
is awarded to Captain Virgil I. Grissom...

1270
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:10,420
who distinguished himself by valor
above and beyond the call of duty.

1271
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:13,100
These actions...

1272
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:16,100
reflect great credit upon himself...

1273
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:18,380
the Air Force...

1274
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:22,180
and the United States of America.

1275
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:35,860
You proud, boys?

1276
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:49,220
Hey, look. They filled up the refrigerator.

1277
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:53,420
Pretty good, huh?

1278
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:55,620
Pretty good.

1279
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:57,820
A full refrigerator!

1280
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:01,980
I can see this afternoon
is shaping up just great!

1281
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:04,860
And the rest of the day. Tomorrow, too!

1282
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:07,500
What do they want me to do in here?

1283
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,540
Cook?

1284
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:13,140
Then risk my life and my kids'...

1285
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:17,020
by dragging them across that highway
to the worst beach in Florida!

1286
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:20,660
Oh, Gus, I wanted to eat
in the White House.

1287
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:23,980
I wanted to talk to Jackie about...

1288
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:26,660
things.

1289
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:31,700
Well, look, I've got to go
to the Holiday Inn for some...

1290
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:34,380
beer call with the guys.

1291
02:04:38,740 --> 02:04:41,100
All those years of test flying...

1292
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:46,060
and all those times I waited
and all those times you weren't there!

1293
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:49,540
The military promised...

1294
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:54,020
and now they are welshing
on that damn compact.

1295
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:57,540
Look, I am finally
"Mrs. Honorable Astronaut."

1296
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:00,100
But they are treating me like I'm...

1297
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:04,260
Honorable
"Mrs. Squirming Hatch Blower!"

1298
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:06,180
I didn't do anything wrong!

1299
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:10,980
The hatch just blew! It was a glitch!
It was a technical malfunction!

1300
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:13,540
Why in hell won't anyone believe me?

1301
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:21,700
I know that.

1302
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:29,780
Gus, I mean are these the goodies?

1303
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:33,620
Is this how the military pays off?

1304
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:41,380
Oh, Gus, they owe you.

1305
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,900
But they owe me, too.

1306
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:48,620
They owe me.

1307
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:51,940
They owe me, they owe me so much!

1308
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:33,580
I love you.

1309
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:41,180
We are here with Virgil I. Grissom
and his lovely wife, Betty.

1310
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:45,020
Gus has just come back
from the second trip in space.

1311
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:47,380
Betty, how do you feel about this trip?

1312
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:49,220
I'm so proud of him.

1313
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:51,220
I think he was wonderful.

1314
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:53,380
We're all proud of Gus Grissom.

1315
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:56,580
Gus, how do you feel about the trip?
Was it a success?

1316
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:58,500
It was A-okay.

1317
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:04,140
My God. He lost his capsule
but he's keeping his story.

1318
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:06,380
To recap yesterday's dramatic events...

1319
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:09,460
here we see America's
newest hero, Gus Grissom.

1320
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:11,980
He is shouting to save the capsule first.

1321
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:16,220
Pull that in flight test, it's all over for him.

1322
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:20,580
He screwed the pooch, partner.
Plain and simple.

1323
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:24,020
Sometimes you get a pooch
that can't be screwed.

1324
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:28,740
The President's got his own problems
with the Bay of Pigs.

1325
02:07:28,820 --> 02:07:31,180
He doesn't want
the astronauts' image tarnished.

1326
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:34,100
Nothing these guys do
is going to be called a failure.

1327
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:35,980
These astronauts are our Davids.

1328
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:40,060
You'd think the public would know they're
just doing what monkeys have done.

1329
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:47,420
You think a monkey knows he's sitting
on a rocket that might explode?

1330
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:50,620
These astronauts know that.

1331
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:54,220
I'll tell you something.

1332
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:57,700
It takes a special man to volunteer
for a suicide mission.

1333
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:59,460
Especially when it's on TV.

1334
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:05,500
Old Gus, he did all right.

1335
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:08,020
Though the capsule was lost,
our new hero...

1336
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:10,220
Astronaut Gus Grissom, was saved.

1337
02:08:10,940 --> 02:08:14,940
Now President Kennedy has started
an even more ambitious space program.

1338
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:17,140
Those who came before us...

1339
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:19,460
made certain this country...

1340
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:22,900
rode the first waves
of the industrial revolution...

1341
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:26,420
the first waves of modern invention...

1342
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:28,420
and the first wave of nuclear power.

1343
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:31,780
And this generation does not intend...

1344
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:34,300
to founder in the backwash...

1345
02:08:34,580 --> 02:08:37,940
of the coming age of space.
We mean to be a part of it.

1346
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:39,700
We mean to lead it.

1347
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:34,860
You know, I always hated flying.

1348
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:41,660
When I met you, you were already a pilot,
so I never had a complaint coming.

1349
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:46,020
When you went up in those planes,
me and the kids...

1350
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:54,460
We never had any insurance
except a couple months' pay.

1351
02:10:56,740 --> 02:10:59,340
I always hated all that talk
about insurance.

1352
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:04,380
The government spends
all kinds of time and money...

1353
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:07,060
teaching pilots how to be fearless.

1354
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:12,780
But they don't spend a penny
teaching you how to be...

1355
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:15,820
the fearless wife of a test pilot.

1356
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:22,380
But I guess I liked it.

1357
02:11:28,620 --> 02:11:31,140
I guess I liked the kind of man who could...

1358
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:34,300
push the outside of the envelope.

1359
02:11:36,940 --> 02:11:38,060
Flyboy.

1360
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:45,540
But I never could stand a man
who was one of those "remember-whens."

1361
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:50,180
Those bitter guys that just sit around
thinking about old times.

1362
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:58,740
If I ever see that happen...

1363
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:04,700
I'm going right out the front door.

1364
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:10,660
And you'll never catch me.

1365
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:15,140
I'm a fearless man,
but I'm scared to death of you.

1366
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:17,060
No, you're not.

1367
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:19,900
But you ought to be.

1368
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:42,500
What is it?

1369
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:45,940
The Russians have sent Titov up.

1370
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:47,180
Titov's up.

1371
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:48,700
How long?

1372
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:49,740
A day.

1373
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:52,340
A day? A whole day?

1374
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:54,860
He's orbiting over our country right now.

1375
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:58,100
We need a man in orbit or it's all over.

1376
02:12:58,420 --> 02:13:01,380
We're scrapping the Redstone
and going with the Atlas.

1377
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:03,140
You know what that means.

1378
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:06,060
We haven't had too much luck
with that rocket.

1379
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:08,940
We can't take all the precautions we'd like.

1380
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,060
- It'll be dangerous.
- We're ready.

1381
02:13:11,140 --> 02:13:12,820
I said it'll be dangerous.

1382
02:13:12,900 --> 02:13:16,260
- I said we're ready. 100 percent.
- Thank you.

1383
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:32,620
Inside this trim,
modest suburban home is Annie Glenn...

1384
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:34,980
wife of Astronaut John Glenn...

1385
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:39,500
sharing the anxiety and pride
of the world at this tense moment...

1386
02:13:39,860 --> 02:13:43,660
but in a private and crucial way
that only she can understand.

1387
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:53,420
The Vice President would like
to see Mrs. Glenn.

1388
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:55,620
He's asking for you again.

1389
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:58,220
Tell them no.

1390
02:13:58,900 --> 02:14:00,820
I'm sorry, she says no.

1391
02:14:00,940 --> 02:14:03,020
You don't understand. It is very important.

1392
02:14:03,100 --> 02:14:05,060
The Vice President must see her.

1393
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:09,900
We are told after the mission's success...

1394
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:13,460
the Vice President will come here
and speak with Annie Glenn.

1395
02:14:13,740 --> 02:14:16,860
Meanwhile, John Glenn waits
for the weather to clear...

1396
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:19,540
so he can undertake this historic mission.

1397
02:14:20,020 --> 02:14:22,020
You know what the Russians want?

1398
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:27,180
They want our peckers in their pockets.

1399
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:31,900
She still says no.

1400
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:37,380
Didn't you tell her I'll bring in ABC-TV...

1401
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:40,500
NBC-TV, CBS-TV?

1402
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:44,580
Her words, and mine,
will be heard by millions.

1403
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:55,740
Where are they going?

1404
02:14:57,780 --> 02:14:59,820
I think the flight's been cancelled.

1405
02:14:59,900 --> 02:15:01,100
Cancelled?

1406
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:05,300
That's perfect.

1407
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:09,300
I will go in and console her
on nationwide TV.

1408
02:15:10,420 --> 02:15:12,300
I'll pay her a sympathy call.

1409
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:43,780
The Vice President would like to make
a sympathy call if he could.

1410
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:49,620
- No? What do you mean, "No"?
- I mean, "No."

1411
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:52,100
What do you mean, "No"?

1412
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:54,500
Somebody get NASA on the line.

1413
02:15:54,660 --> 02:15:58,700
I'm going to lean on NASA.
I'm going right to the top!

1414
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:01,500
- To the top.
- Damn right!

1415
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:04,420
They better tell her to play ball!

1416
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:14,780
There's a problem with your wife.

1417
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:16,580
- Is it serious?
- We think it is.

1418
02:16:16,740 --> 02:16:19,220
There's a phone hookup,
we've got her on it.

1419
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:29,620
It's me. Are you all right?

1420
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:30,980
What's wrong?

1421
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:33,100
Johnson...

1422
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:36,740
wants... me...

1423
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:42,820
on T... V.

1424
02:16:42,980 --> 02:16:44,140
The Vice President?

1425
02:16:44,220 --> 02:16:46,500
Tell her to let him in with the networks.

1426
02:16:46,860 --> 02:16:48,180
It's coverage.

1427
02:16:52,460 --> 02:16:54,020
It's important, John.

1428
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:55,700
It means a lot.

1429
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:02,700
Listen to me.

1430
02:17:04,940 --> 02:17:07,260
If you don't want the Vice President...

1431
02:17:07,580 --> 02:17:10,780
or the networks,
or anyone else in our house, that's it!

1432
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:13,940
As far as I'm concerned,
they are not coming in!

1433
02:17:14,020 --> 02:17:17,220
And I will back you up 100 percent,
and you tell them that!

1434
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:23,060
I don't want Johnson or the others
to even put a toe in our house.

1435
02:17:29,580 --> 02:17:33,820
You tell them that Astronaut John Glenn
told you to say that.

1436
02:17:42,060 --> 02:17:43,820
I'll talk to you soon.

1437
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:50,220
You can't do that!

1438
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:52,460
The Vice President's head of the program!

1439
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:54,300
You must think of the program!

1440
02:17:54,380 --> 02:17:55,780
You are out of line!

1441
02:17:55,860 --> 02:17:57,860
- I'm out of line?
- Yes, sir!

1442
02:17:59,020 --> 02:18:00,220
I run the show here.

1443
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:01,980
We'll see about that!

1444
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:05,740
And I'm thinking of changing
the order of flight assignments!

1445
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:07,900
Who will you get?

1446
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:10,020
You heard what he said.

1447
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:17,060
Take it easy, fellows.

1448
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:18,820
Step aside, pal.

1449
02:18:30,380 --> 02:18:31,660
Pilots!

1450
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:36,940
Pansies! Cows!

1451
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:40,940
Gladiolas!

1452
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:44,980
Isn't there anybody
who can deal with a housewife?

1453
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:12,660
Waltzing Matilda,
I thought Hank Williams wrote it.

1454
02:19:12,780 --> 02:19:14,580
We don't know who wrote it.

1455
02:19:14,660 --> 02:19:16,340
It's Australian, right?

1456
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:26,340
Who are you guys?

1457
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:31,020
We're aborigines.

1458
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:37,500
Who are you?

1459
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:38,580
Me?

1460
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:42,380
I'm an astronaut.

1461
02:19:46,180 --> 02:19:48,780
Well, what do you do here, Astronaut?

1462
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:53,340
I'm here because a buddy of mine
is getting ready to...

1463
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:56,540
fly overhead. Up in outer space.

1464
02:19:57,060 --> 02:19:59,580
And I'll be talking to him on that dish.

1465
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:01,780
Fly over?

1466
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:04,140
You blokes do that, too?

1467
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:06,660
You do that yourself?

1468
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,060
Not me, mate.

1469
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:11,380
See that old bloke there?

1470
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:14,060
He know.

1471
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:15,620
He know the moon.

1472
02:20:16,420 --> 02:20:17,860
He know the star.

1473
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:20,740
And he know the Milky Way.

1474
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:22,980
He'll give you a hand.

1475
02:20:24,060 --> 02:20:25,220
He know.

1476
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:31,900
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

1477
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:03,300
Stand by for final ten-second count.

1478
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:04,100
The clock is operating.

1479
02:22:04,860 --> 02:22:06,620
We're underway!

1480
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:15,420
Good Lord, ride all the way.
Godspeed, John Glenn.

1481
02:23:27,140 --> 02:23:29,500
Zero-g, and I feel fine.

1482
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:33,500
The capsule is turning around.

1483
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:38,780
The view is tremendous!

1484
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:43,220
I can see clear back,
a big cloud pattern, towards the Cape.

1485
02:23:43,300 --> 02:23:45,100
It's a beautiful sight!

1486
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:49,820
Roger, Friendship 7.
You have a go, at least seven orbits.

1487
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:57,100
Roger, Al. Understand,
go at least seven orbits.

1488
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:58,780
This is Friendship 7.

1489
02:24:23,980 --> 02:24:27,300
Speed is 17,500 miles per hour...

1490
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:37,340
and we're moving into night.

1491
02:24:57,420 --> 02:24:59,180
Full moon rising.

1492
02:25:03,140 --> 02:25:04,860
I can almost touch it.

1493
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:22,460
Friendship 7, come in. Do you read?

1494
02:25:25,940 --> 02:25:27,820
Friendship 7, come in, please.

1495
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:29,940
This sure was a short day.

1496
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:31,740
Say again, please. Over.

1497
02:25:32,220 --> 02:25:34,780
That was the shortest day I've run into.

1498
02:25:35,300 --> 02:25:37,140
Kind of passes rapidly, huh?

1499
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:39,020
Yes, sir.

1500
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:44,340
I can see some lights down there
in Australia, Gordo.

1501
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:46,500
Where are they from?

1502
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:50,900
All of Perth and Rockingham
have turned their lights on for you.

1503
02:25:52,260 --> 02:25:55,380
And we have a few other lights turned on,
here and there.

1504
02:26:00,620 --> 02:26:02,340
They show up very well.

1505
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:05,660
Thank everybody for turning them on,
will you?

1506
02:26:06,060 --> 02:26:08,780
We sure will, John. We sure will.

1507
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:26,860
Heading towards daybreak.

1508
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:06,700
Lot of cloud coverage today.

1509
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:15,820
Man, it's beautiful.

1510
02:27:30,380 --> 02:27:32,300
Possibly it's the heat shield.

1511
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:33,740
It's loose.

1512
02:27:36,380 --> 02:27:37,660
If it comes off...

1513
02:27:37,740 --> 02:27:40,300
If the heat shield comes off, he'll burn up.

1514
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:43,260
He'll fry when he tries to re-enter.

1515
02:27:57,700 --> 02:27:59,300
Muchea, this is Cape.

1516
02:28:00,260 --> 02:28:01,980
We're showing some trouble.

1517
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:05,300
We've got a warning light.
Possibly a loose heat shield.

1518
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:07,620
Check your status lights immediately.

1519
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:27,260
He's coming.

1520
02:28:29,020 --> 02:28:30,540
John, can you hear me?

1521
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:34,860
Friendship 7, come in, please.

1522
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:36,780
Try something. Anything.

1523
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:38,100
Friendship 7, come in.

1524
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:15,060
This is Friendship 7. Do you read me?

1525
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:18,300
Wait a second.

1526
02:29:19,740 --> 02:29:21,940
I see something strange out here.

1527
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:25,340
Oh! My goodness, what the heck is that?

1528
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:29,340
Sparks and needles of some kind
all over the sky!

1529
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:32,660
Hey, let me tell you what I'm in up here.

1530
02:29:32,980 --> 02:29:35,380
I'm in a mass of very small particles...

1531
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:38,740
that are brilliantly lit up.
Like they're luminescent.

1532
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:40,860
I never saw anything like it.

1533
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:43,300
A shower of them coming by me now.

1534
02:29:43,380 --> 02:29:46,340
They're bright yellow.
They swirl around the capsule...

1535
02:29:46,420 --> 02:29:49,180
and they're brilliantly lighted.

1536
02:29:50,140 --> 02:29:52,860
Do you think they could be alive?

1537
02:29:55,060 --> 02:29:58,620
It sounds ridiculous,
but they look like fireflies or something.

1538
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:04,700
Maybe some Air Force experiment
went amuck.

1539
02:30:04,980 --> 02:30:07,220
Could our astronomers have been wrong?

1540
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:10,460
Hello, CapCom, do you read me?
This is miraculous!

1541
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:14,460
Could it be those fireflies,
or whatever they are?

1542
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:16,820
Of course not. Fireflies?

1543
02:30:19,380 --> 02:30:21,020
Roger, Friendship 7.

1544
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:25,780
Will you correlate the actions
of the surrounding particles...

1545
02:30:25,900 --> 02:30:27,980
with that of your control jets?

1546
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:30,940
Negative.

1547
02:30:31,540 --> 02:30:34,940
I do not think they were coming
from my control jets.

1548
02:30:36,060 --> 02:30:37,940
I'll tell you what I'll try to do.

1549
02:30:38,060 --> 02:30:40,780
I'll try to get some pictures
of these little guys.

1550
02:30:40,860 --> 02:30:42,420
Sounds like a good idea.

1551
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:45,180
You guys probably think I'm nuts.

1552
02:30:46,300 --> 02:30:48,020
They're very beautiful.

1553
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:50,500
Look like fireflies on a summer night.

1554
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:52,300
They just dance around.

1555
02:31:28,300 --> 02:31:29,700
Get out of here!

1556
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:34,580
Get out of here, you gadgets!

1557
02:31:37,060 --> 02:31:39,460
Heading into daybreak now. Another day.

1558
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:41,580
Leaving the fireflies behind.

1559
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:44,020
I have no idea what they were.

1560
02:31:44,940 --> 02:31:46,540
This is Friendship 7.

1561
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:50,220
That was some night.
That was really exciting.

1562
02:31:50,300 --> 02:31:51,940
He's going into his third orbit.

1563
02:31:52,060 --> 02:31:55,060
How much longer are you going
to keep him in the dark?

1564
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:56,620
What do we tell him?

1565
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:59,660
He's a pilot.
Tell him the condition of his craft.

1566
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:06,820
Glenn is in his third orbit...

1567
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:09,500
and the flight is going
pretty much as planned.

1568
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:11,300
No human individual...

1569
02:32:11,380 --> 02:32:13,820
has ever been so well prepared.

1570
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:17,580
So far the keyword
on this textbook flight is "operational."

1571
02:32:17,740 --> 02:32:19,420
Everything is A-okay.

1572
02:32:21,380 --> 02:32:24,180
We haven't been too lucky
with the Atlas rocket.

1573
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:27,820
Some say we haven't taken all
the safety precautions we'd like to.

1574
02:32:27,900 --> 02:32:29,060
Is this true?

1575
02:32:29,180 --> 02:32:30,860
No, it's absolutely not true.

1576
02:32:31,420 --> 02:32:33,940
The only critical point is the re-entry.

1577
02:32:34,380 --> 02:32:37,140
If the capsule is not at the correct angle...

1578
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:40,820
with the blunt end and heat shield down,
it will burn up.

1579
02:32:41,180 --> 02:32:42,940
There is only one hope.

1580
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:46,060
It might be possible to leave
the retro-rocket package...

1581
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:48,060
which covers the heat shield, on.

1582
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:53,020
The straps may be strong enough
to hold the heat shield in place.

1583
02:32:53,740 --> 02:32:55,460
But if this fails...

1584
02:32:57,060 --> 02:33:00,100
John, you're going to
fly-by-wire for re-entry.

1585
02:33:00,980 --> 02:33:04,500
We recommend you do the best
you can to keep a zero angle. Over.

1586
02:33:05,260 --> 02:33:07,180
Re-entry only three orbits? Over.

1587
02:33:07,540 --> 02:33:08,980
That is correct. Over.

1588
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:11,180
Do you have a reason for this? Over.

1589
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:14,820
Not at this time.
This is the judgment of Cape Flight.

1590
02:33:16,900 --> 02:33:17,900
Roger.

1591
02:33:18,740 --> 02:33:21,940
Do you have a time for going
to jettison retro? Over.

1592
02:33:24,340 --> 02:33:27,220
We are not sure your landing bag
is deployed.

1593
02:33:27,900 --> 02:33:31,340
We feel it is possible to re-enter
with the retro-package on.

1594
02:33:31,620 --> 02:33:35,020
We see no difficulty at this time
with that type of re-entry.

1595
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:36,500
Do you read?

1596
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:38,540
Roger.

1597
02:33:39,860 --> 02:33:41,300
Understand.

1598
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:46,260
I'll start lining up as carefully as I can
in a minute.

1599
02:33:46,660 --> 02:33:51,260
See whether scanners will pick up
and correct it for good retro-fire attitude.

1600
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:53,260
If not...

1601
02:33:53,940 --> 02:33:55,860
I'll correct it myself.

1602
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:58,940
Roger, Friendship 7.

1603
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:09,380
We're lined up.

1604
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:11,620
Here we go.

1605
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:50,340
What's that sound?

1606
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:52,100
Humming. It's him.

1607
02:34:52,180 --> 02:34:54,100
It's all right. He does that.

1608
02:35:59,860 --> 02:36:01,220
- John...
- He can't hear you.

1609
02:36:01,780 --> 02:36:03,900
He's hit the ionization blackout.

1610
02:36:04,820 --> 02:36:07,780
No communications are possible
for a few minutes.

1611
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:11,860
Then we'll know.

1612
02:36:20,820 --> 02:36:23,380
Friendship 7, this is Cape. Do you read?

1613
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:32,340
This is Cape. Do you read?

1614
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:40,180
Friendship 7, this is Cape. Do you read?

1615
02:36:40,580 --> 02:36:44,260
Automatic systems are not functioning.
He's in fly-by-wire...

1616
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:46,420
Finally showed up.

1617
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:49,020
The one with the big engine.

1618
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:53,580
Boy, if we'd only had
one of those a few years back.

1619
02:37:54,740 --> 02:37:58,940
The bad news is the entire program's
probably going to be scrapped.

1620
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:03,660
From now on, the astronaut boys
in Houston have got the only ticket.

1621
02:38:04,460 --> 02:38:08,020
Barring, of course, some unforeseen event.

1622
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:31,900
The Russians set a new record
of 114,000 feet...

1623
02:38:31,980 --> 02:38:33,940
going straight off the ground.

1624
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:36,620
Nobody cares about
that kind of record anymore.

1625
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:40,340
All they want now
is capsules up in outer space.

1626
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:47,340
I get a feeling this plane might be able
to beat that Russian record.

1627
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:51,700
You might be right.

1628
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:39,340
And here they come!

1629
02:39:48,740 --> 02:39:51,660
Looky here what I brought you!

1630
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:03,780
Mr. And Mrs. John Glenn.

1631
02:40:08,660 --> 02:40:10,340
Alan Shepard.

1632
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:16,620
Gus Grissom.

1633
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:21,100
Scott Carpenter.

1634
02:40:23,380 --> 02:40:25,380
Deke Slayton.

1635
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:29,860
Wally Schirra.

1636
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:32,940
Mr. And Mrs. Gordon Cooper.

1637
02:40:33,460 --> 02:40:34,700
Smile, hon.

1638
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:37,460
My fellow citizens...

1639
02:40:39,980 --> 02:40:44,060
America's Mercury astronauts!

1640
02:40:55,340 --> 02:40:58,220
Welcome to Houston, your new home.

1641
02:40:58,500 --> 02:41:03,060
Your neighbors here and I,
we'd like to give you this little barbecue...

1642
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:07,020
Texas style!

1643
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:52,860
Since you're relocating here,
to show appreciation for all you've done...

1644
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:55,940
Mr. Sharp is contributing the land...

1645
02:41:56,020 --> 02:41:58,020
the contractors the homes...

1646
02:41:58,140 --> 02:42:00,980
and the department stores,
all the furnishings.

1647
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:03,220
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you.

1648
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:04,860
- Which one are you?
- Shepard.

1649
02:42:07,660 --> 02:42:10,180
Which one's Glenn? I want to meet him.

1650
02:42:11,780 --> 02:42:13,300
He's over there.

1651
02:42:13,540 --> 02:42:14,540
Excuse me.

1652
02:42:15,820 --> 02:42:16,820
Excuse me, too.

1653
02:42:22,260 --> 02:42:25,380
I'm going to the moon,
I swear to God, I'm on my way.

1654
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:31,740
Hi, little gal.
Damned glad to meet you, too.

1655
02:42:31,940 --> 02:42:35,420
I heard an awful lot of good things
about you, gal.

1656
02:42:39,100 --> 02:42:40,300
- Howdy.
- How are you?

1657
02:42:40,380 --> 02:42:41,980
I want to meet you, too.

1658
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:44,460
Sorry, little lady.

1659
02:42:44,660 --> 02:42:45,700
We got it.

1660
02:42:46,100 --> 02:42:48,860
Steak. All the trimmings.

1661
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:52,540
Just like Pancho's.

1662
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:57,180
Steak tastes about the same...

1663
02:42:57,940 --> 02:43:00,700
only there's a lot
more trimmings now, Gus.

1664
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:04,740
You know, it's funny.

1665
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:09,900
Here I am, I got $25,000 a year
for a magazine contract.

1666
02:43:10,820 --> 02:43:13,340
I got a free house with all the furnishings.

1667
02:43:13,420 --> 02:43:15,100
Got me a Corvette.

1668
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:19,420
I got a free lunch from one end of America
to the other...

1669
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:22,620
and I ain't even been up there yet.

1670
02:43:24,820 --> 02:43:25,820
I noticed that.

1671
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:29,260
Oh, you noticed that?
You noticed I hadn't been up there yet?

1672
02:43:31,940 --> 02:43:34,300
They're saving the best for last.

1673
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:38,900
Yeah, I guess so, Hot Dog. I guess so.

1674
02:43:41,260 --> 02:43:43,500
Just watch you don't screw the pooch.

1675
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:06,780
We're talking to Gordon Cooper.
He will be the next to orbit the Earth.

1676
02:44:08,620 --> 02:44:13,260
Since you're the last of the original seven
and the least well known...

1677
02:44:13,380 --> 02:44:17,900
could you begin by telling us
who was the best pilot you ever saw?

1678
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:21,100
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

1679
02:44:28,180 --> 02:44:30,700
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

1680
02:44:34,940 --> 02:44:36,460
I'll tell you.

1681
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:41,260
I've seen a lot of them, and
most of them were pictures on a wall...

1682
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:42,420
Excuse me, what'd you say?

1683
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:46,540
I said, "pictures on a wall,"
back at some place that...

1684
02:44:48,700 --> 02:44:50,700
doesn't even exist anymore.

1685
02:44:53,780 --> 02:44:55,220
Some of them are...

1686
02:44:55,340 --> 02:44:57,260
right here in this room.

1687
02:44:58,860 --> 02:45:00,620
And some of them are...

1688
02:45:01,300 --> 02:45:05,260
they're still out there somewhere,
doing what they always do.

1689
02:45:05,380 --> 02:45:08,660
Going up each day
in a hurtling piece of machinery...

1690
02:45:08,780 --> 02:45:11,500
putting their hides out on the line...

1691
02:45:11,900 --> 02:45:14,180
hanging it out over the edge...

1692
02:45:14,420 --> 02:45:18,020
pushing back the outside
of that envelope and hauling it back.

1693
02:45:20,020 --> 02:45:21,580
But there was...

1694
02:45:22,140 --> 02:45:26,540
one pilot I once saw who I think
truly did have the right...

1695
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:29,580
How close did you ever come
to not hauling it back?

1696
02:45:34,660 --> 02:45:36,940
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

1697
02:45:37,260 --> 02:45:39,300
Well, you're looking at him.

1698
02:45:54,020 --> 02:45:54,980
Hey, Ridley!

1699
02:45:56,820 --> 02:45:58,580
You got any Beemans?

1700
02:46:00,020 --> 02:46:01,740
I might have me a stick.

1701
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:04,460
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

1702
02:46:06,140 --> 02:46:07,460
Fair enough.

1703
02:46:08,780 --> 02:46:11,780
Think I see a plane over here
with my name on it.

1704
02:46:14,020 --> 02:46:15,620
Now you're talking.

1705
02:46:29,740 --> 02:46:31,140
Hey, what's that?

1706
02:46:31,380 --> 02:46:33,220
Anyone got clearance?

1707
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:38,980
What kind of a plane is that?

1708
02:46:44,700 --> 02:46:47,580
Aircraft on ramp, did you file a flight plan?

1709
02:46:48,540 --> 02:46:51,500
Aircraft on ramp, did you file a flight plan?

1710
02:46:52,140 --> 02:46:55,620
I'm taking her up to wring her out a bit.
Any objections?

1711
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:57,100
It's Yeager.

1712
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:00,820
No objections.

1713
02:47:01,180 --> 02:47:03,020
You are clear to taxi.

1714
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:06,580
He must have clearance. Right?

1715
02:47:06,780 --> 02:47:08,780
Yeah. Sure, he must.

1716
02:47:09,340 --> 02:47:10,860
It's here someplace.

1717
02:49:10,860 --> 02:49:13,060
Now, in honor of...

1718
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:17,020
these, the greatest pilots
in the history of mankind...

1719
02:49:17,500 --> 02:49:21,340
it gives me great pleasure, great pride,
to present to you...

1720
02:49:21,980 --> 02:49:23,700
Miss Sally Rand!

1721
02:52:09,660 --> 02:52:11,580
Stretch it! Stretch it!

1722
02:52:12,260 --> 02:52:13,660
You can do it!

1723
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:18,620
Just a little bit more. 104,000, here you go.

1724
02:52:23,820 --> 02:52:25,380
Christ Almighty!

1725
02:55:36,660 --> 02:55:38,300
Sir, over there.

1726
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:42,100
Is that a man?

1727
02:55:45,140 --> 02:55:47,220
Yeah, you're damn right it is!

1728
02:56:51,180 --> 02:56:53,420
We hate to disturb you, buddy, but...

1729
02:56:54,540 --> 02:56:56,100
we've got a launch.

1730
02:56:59,020 --> 02:57:02,420
There's millions of people watching,
and we thought maybe...

1731
02:57:02,900 --> 02:57:05,820
Yep. Well, no sweat. Let's go.

1732
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:09,620
I'm ready when you are, John, 100 percent.

1733
02:57:15,180 --> 02:57:17,100
Ten, nine...

1734
02:57:57,740 --> 02:57:59,500
Go.

1735
02:58:06,660 --> 02:58:08,900
Go, Hot Dog, go!

1736
02:58:13,540 --> 02:58:16,140
"Up we go into the wild blue yonder."

1737
02:58:16,500 --> 02:58:20,060
Thirty seconds and fuel is go,
oxygen is go...

1738
02:58:20,180 --> 02:58:23,300
cabin pressure on the top peg.
Altimeter is working.

1739
02:58:25,100 --> 02:58:26,980
Have a good ride, buddy. Go!

1740
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:33,900
The sun is coming through the window.

1741
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:38,540
Oh, Lord, what a heavenly light.

1742
02:58:51,020 --> 02:58:53,060
The Mercury program was over.

1743
02:58:53,700 --> 02:58:56,900
Four years later,
Astronaut Gus Grissom was killed...

1744
02:58:56,980 --> 02:58:59,620
along with Astronauts White and Chaffee...

1745
02:58:59,740 --> 02:59:02,740
when fire swept through
their Apollo capsule.

1746
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:07,540
But on that glorious day in May, 1963...

1747
02:59:07,900 --> 02:59:11,260
Gordo Cooper went higher, farther...

1748
02:59:11,540 --> 02:59:13,940
and faster than any other American.

1749
02:59:14,420 --> 02:59:17,180
Twenty-two complete orbits
around the world.

1750
02:59:17,460 --> 02:59:20,700
He was the last American
ever to go into space alone.

1751
02:59:21,260 --> 02:59:23,100
And for a brief moment...

1752
02:59:23,420 --> 02:59:28,300
Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot
anyone had ever seen.
