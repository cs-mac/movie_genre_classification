is some stupid cheer?

163
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,944
Look, I'm sorry things didn't
work out with you and Nathan,

164
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,646
but don't go all Mariah
on me, okay?

165
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,114
You think
this is about Nathan?!

166

[ Scoffs ]
you're not even close!

167

You're not even in
the neighborhood of close!

168
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,119
Then what's wrong?

169
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,121
What's wrong is how pointless
all of this is!

170

Stop saying that!
No, because it's true!

171
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,659
What difference does it make
if you sleep a popular guy,

172
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,160
or you go to the right party,

173

or you know the moves
to some moronic cheer

Hey, you're not
working today.

Yeah,
i have a favor to ask.

178

There's this father-son
charity basketball game.

179
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:18,926
Whitey says I gotta play,
so...You interested?

180
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,694
[ Exhales ] yeah.

181
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:21,629
Yeah?

182
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,130
Yeah, okay.

183
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,266
Of course, I might be, you know,
a little out of shape.

184
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,068
Also not to mention
the fact

185
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,103
that I wasn't worth a crap
in high school.

186
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,205
Well, that's better for us,
right?

187
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,908
Why don't you start coming down
to the court with us?

188

Hang with a member of
the Scott basketball dynasty?

189
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,182
So, how are you
doing with that?

190
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,784
What are you gonna do?

191
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,218
It sucks for my mom.

192
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,987
Yeah, what about you?

193
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,024
Honestly, I can't stand being
connected to Nathan or Dan.

194
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,626
Hey, big brother!

195
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,295
I was getting some cardio in,
ran out of water.

196
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,764
You want to help me out?

197
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,131
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

198
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,770
So, uh, you want to buy
some charity tickets

199
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,638
to the big
father-son game?

200
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:07,174
Oh, well, I could if
i wasn't playing in it.

201
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,141
Luke invited me.

202
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,910
Oh, great.

203
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,313
Try not to soil the Scott family
name while you're at it.

204
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:17,150
That's everyday advice
for you, huh?

205
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,253
Hey, kid?

206
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,023
Seems you have an obligation
to the family name, too.

207
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,925
Don't blow it.

208
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,997
That article's a lie.

209
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,232
You're right. It is a lie.

210
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:35,035
You should never have had
the name in the first place.

211
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,170
Hey! Dan!

212
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,043
Are you okay?

213
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,946
I have no responsibility
to him or his name!

214
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,348
Don't let him get
inside your head, okay?

215
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,950
I don't plan on it.

216
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,219
As a matter of fact,
i think it's about time

217
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,788
I get out from under
this guy completely.

218
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,256
What's that supposed to mean?

219
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,258
Meaning I'm not gonna be
a "Scott" anymore.

220
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,796
I'm gonna change
my last name.

221

You're late.

222
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,382
I expected you this morning
after that article in the paper.

223
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,351
I understand Lucas
has asked Keith

224
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,986
to play
in the basketball game.

225
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,054
You think that's wise?

226
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,156
Why not?

227
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,991
Well, Keith isn't
exactly a father.

[ Chuckles ]

229
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,994
You're not
the best father, either,

230
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,962
Danny,
and you're playing.

231
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,363
What about Lucas?

232
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:40,233
You have to know this would
be embarrassing for him.

233
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,802
Embarrassing for him?

234
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,771
What about
embarrassing for you?

235
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,272
Wait a minute.

236
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:49,309
This isn't about
Lucas and Keith.

237
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,879
This is all about you,
Danny,

238
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:55,949
and that feeling you get in
the pit of your stomach

239
00:11:55,983 --> 00:12:01,354
when you see the son
that you never claimed.

240
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,357
You were
a great player...

241
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,360
Maybe the best
i ever had...

242
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,464
But you can score 100 points
in this game,

243
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:15,102
and that feeling's
not gonna go away.

244
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,536
It'll be there

245
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,407
until you acknowledge
that Lucas is your son,

246

and you made a mistake.

247

Your uncle Keith's been working
hard getting ready for the game.

He mentioned that you're
thinking of,

uh, changing
your last name.

250
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,464
I just don't want people to read
these stupid articles

and think I play ball
just 'cause Dan did.

I don't want you
to have to read that stuff.

Well, you're in
the spotlight now.

with the territory.

to run away from that.

I'd rather you face your
problems head-on.

happy if I took your name.

[ Sighs ]

259
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,293
When I found out
i was pregnant,

260
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,296
Dan already had
a basketball scholarship,

261
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,466
and nothing was gonna get
in the way of that...

262
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,435
But then
something strange happened.

263
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,139
Right before classes started,
Dan changed his mind.

264
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:30,110
He said he'd finish the
semester, and we'd get married.

265
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,014
So when I went into labor,
and you appeared,

266
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:38,451
the nurse asked for your name,
and I said it was "Scott."

267
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,958
Keith was there, and when
the nurse brought you in,

268
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,860
she let him hold you.

269
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:50,097
I've known Keith
my whole life...

270
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,034
And that's the only time
I've seen him cry.

271
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,407
Your father never showed up.

272
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,642
So the hell with him.

273
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,378
I don't want his name.

274
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:09,282
Keith's a "Scott," too,
you know?

275
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,351
I've never been
ashamed of you, Lucas,

276
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,120
not for a second,
or your name.

277
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:16,423
Then, I also never had to
carry that name in this town

278
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,259
the way you have, so if
you want to change it,

00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,427
you have my blessing.

280
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,063
But it's just a name,

Yeah, I guess I really didn't
give this one my best shot.

What's going on with you?

I just -- I didn't know she
was gonna take it this hard.

She went off on Brooke
at practice.

I'm kind of worried
about her.

Maybe you should have
worried about her more

She was driving to school
to pick me up.

She was late,
so she ran a red light.

One light
at the wrong split second,
