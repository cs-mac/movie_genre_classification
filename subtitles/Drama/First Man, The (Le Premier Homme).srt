1
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:28,052
THAT MAN FROM RIO

2
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,752
Eight days of leave.

3
00:02:15,797 --> 00:02:17,341
Yes, eight days.

4
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:39,346
12:00 o'clock break.
- Ooo

5
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:41,406
I'm starving.

6
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:46,912
Smell this cheese.
- Wonderful.

7
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,180
Professor! Professor!
- Yes?

8
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,559
A phone call for you.
- I'm not here.

9
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:06,769
They've robbed the museum!

10
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:10,022
What?

11
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,402
What? The museum?!
I'll come right away.

12
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:19,490
She didn't eat again.
- She didn't eat again.

13
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:35,214
See you later.
- Yes, adios Lebel.

14
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:40,261
Will you go out? - Of course.
- Yes, you have a girlfriend.

15
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:46,184
What if she has someone else?
- Impossible! If she has... than... And it's over!

16
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:53,024
Would you really hit a woman?
- Listen, my friend. Nobody is worthy of this.

17
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:57,020
In eight days on 14:40 train.

18
00:05:57,696 --> 00:05:59,530
You bet! Don't be late.

19
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,742
Later, Lebel.
- See you, Dufourquet.

20
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:10,708
No one can enter.
- I'm Agnes de Villermosa.

21
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:16,339
That's all?
- Yes, I finished. Thank you.

22
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:23,262
There are no surface wounds.
I believe, it's a heart attack.

23
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:26,974
Poor man most likely died of fear.
- You must agree, Professor...

24
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:28,684
...that something here smells funny.

25
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:39,320
He didn't touch the golden crown
or the necklace with rubies.

26
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:44,367
Most likely he's a crazy collector.
- The statuette is something really special.

27
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,371
It's priceless.
The civilization that made it has disappeared.

28
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:51,707
Disappeared? - The Maltek civilization.
- Maltek? And what has this to do with that? - Everything.

29
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,584
And who are the Malteks?

30
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:58,297
People of the Amazon rainforest, who were destroyed
by barbarians. - Barbarians?

31
00:06:58,297 --> 00:07:01,717
Conquistadors. Europeans. You, me...
- Me?

32
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:09,475
Have you been there? In the rainforest?
- Yes, I will show you.

33
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:15,022
Photo taken three years ago.
On the day that the expedition ended.

34
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:16,858
Yes, I see you.

35
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:22,071
You're here.
- No, here.

36
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:29,036
And the other two?
- Villermosa, who died after we returned.

37
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:32,582
And Di Castro.
The Brazilian who financed the expedition.

38
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:40,965
Each one of you came back with your own doll,
and yours now got stolen.

39
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:43,301
Exactly.
- We won't get anywhere that way.

40
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:48,431
The Malteks were interested in secrets and hypnosis.

41
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:51,142
Do you know what was their best weapon?
- Swords, spears?

42
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:53,728
Poison.

43
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:59,066
That's nonsense.
- What if not all of them disappeared?

44
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,988
Yes... Indians dead for the last 300 years
came to Paris...

45
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:08,492
...only to steal a lousy piece of wood.
With the help of hypnosis. Obvious!

46
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,579
The statuettes are cursed.

47
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:16,876
I gave mine to the museum.
That's why they came here.

48
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,836
Villermosa kept his and died from a poisonous arrow.

49
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:22,965
Why didn't you tell me, Martin?
- But I did, three years ago.

50
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:26,844
Agnes, you came. - Of course.
- Whom do I have the honour...

51
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:31,974
The daughter of Mr. Villermose.
- I didn't know. But of course.

52
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,143
Excuse me, miss.

53
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:39,357
Do you know where is the statuette of your father?
- We never found it.

54
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:46,030
Father hid it before he died.
- Ah, I see. Thank you.

55
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:50,201
I will accompany the lady.
- I'll wait.

56
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,962
Look, I found something. An arrow.

57
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:04,674
Everyone ridiculed me and told me
that the Malteks have died.

58
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:08,636
Those morons think that I'm mad.
The rainforest swallowed the Malteks...

59
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:14,642
...submitted to green oblivion...
It's nice that you dropped by.

60
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:19,230
You always come if something goes wrong.
Thank you.

61
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,860
I would take such a little girl for a daughter at once.

62
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:29,991
I'm not a little girl anymore.
You always call me that way.

63
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:34,453
Only once every six months.
- Haven't I changed at all?

64
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:40,209
You've chnaged a lot. You are more...
- Feminine? Ha ha ha

65
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,463
Quite a little different, no?
- Yes, truly.

66
00:09:45,882 --> 00:09:47,466
So?

67
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,552
I still age alone.

68
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:57,894
How is your aunt?
- Come for a visit, you'll find out.

69
00:09:57,894 --> 00:09:59,770
Bye!

70
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:03,876
Why would they kidnap the professor?
- Because of the statuette, of course.

71
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:09,423
The story repeats itself.
- It interests me, what's with these statuettes.

72
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:14,303
They haven't found the statuette of Mr. Villermose?
- No. - No, no, no.

73
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,226
After the expedition my brother,
her father, hid the statuette.

74
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:23,896
After that, poor him...

75
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,481
Dreadful thing, madam.

76
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:30,444
Adrien! - Free for a whole week.
Did you get the postcard? Well, I'm here.

77
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:32,405
Greetings, auntie!

78
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:38,578
Whom do I have the honor...
- My pleasure. Well, until later.

79
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:41,247
We'll come back in a week.
Don't wait for me. - No.

80
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,166
Not now, the police is here.

81
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,668
Police?

82
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:55,052
You say that your father hid the statuette.
- Yes.

83
00:11:55,052 --> 00:12:00,016
And Agnes knows where he hid it.
- At that time we lived in Rio...

84
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:04,645
She was only 14.
- He hid it at the top of the aviary.

85
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:09,817
An aviary in Brazil?
- I remember. At three in the afternoon everyone was sleeping.

86
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:15,364
I also went to take a rest...
when I saw from the window...

87
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:21,454
...how father dug a hole
and put the statuette in it.

88
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:27,668
He wore gloves and was all sweaty.

89
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:30,796
If we were to go there, I'd find it for sure.

90
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,557
Draw the location, I'll send it to the Brazilian police.
- I don't know exactly.

91
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:45,937
I would have to be there.
- Miss, your car is blocking the traffic.

92
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:49,690
My car? Let's see.

93
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:55,863
It is blocking. I'll be there right away.
- You forgot about me?

94
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:59,659
I haven't forgotten about you, young man.
Come here.

95
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:05,122
Whom do I have the plasure...
- Soldier Dufourquet, 3rd squadron.

96
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:09,085
A pilot, then. You don't look like one. A relative?
- No.

97
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:12,588
Fiance? - Not yet.
- What are you here for?

98
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:16,759
Agnes is a friend of mine.
- Oh, is she? - Yes, she is.

99
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:19,846
What are you saying?

100
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,187
Why did they kidnap the professor?
- The professor? Oh yes!

101
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,189
I'll tell you.

102
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:37,989
I kidnapped him.
- Listen. We'll be friends...

103
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:40,950
...if you don't make fun.
- Do you want details?

104
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,912
I stood at the window, the night was coming down...

105
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:50,251
...when two sinister men in black
stepped out of the car.

106
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:57,300
They walked slowly towards the professor,
reached him...

107
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:01,345
...and kidnapped him.
Shit! They kidnapped her!

108
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,782
Stop him!

109
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:59,554
Your ticket, please. - I must stop...
- You can get a ticket from the machine.

110
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:20,902
Get in line, like everyone else.

111
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:46,135
Agnes!

112
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:50,348
Thank you, sir.

113
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,268
General, general? Should I bring you a newspaper?

114
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,770
Yes, please, miss.

115
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:10,576
You didn't bring one miss?
Still, you are charming.

116
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:14,747
At your orders, general.
- At rest!

117
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:24,674
Like Charlesroi!

118
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:42,024
Sir, your boarding pass. You have to go there.

119
00:17:55,705 --> 00:18:00,418
Agnes!
- You have to go there.

120
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:03,796
All passengers embarked.

121
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:15,516
Listen... - Sit down, sir.
- Listen to me me, please.

122
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:18,978
Please...
- Buckle up yourself. I will help you.

123
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:32,658
Dear passengers, welcome on the plane
to Rio de Janeiro.

124
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:33,701
Rio!

125
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:37,747
Can I help? - No.
- Do you need anything? - No.

126
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:41,167
You seat...
- It is here.

127
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:45,296
If Lebel could hear this!

128
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:12,365
Sir?
- I have to talk to the capitan.

129
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:15,451
We can not distrub him.
- It's a serious matter.

130
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,245
They have kidnapped this girl.
- Which one?

131
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:21,791
The one who sits between those two men.
- Wait, please.

132
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:31,342
You passports, please. Thank you.

133
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,262
Thank you.

134
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:40,393
That's what the mister says.
- Do you know him?

135
00:19:46,524 --> 00:19:48,943
No.
- Agnes, after everything...

136
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:52,405
Return to your seat. We do not want any problems.
- But Agnes...

137
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:58,160
I will notify the police in Rio.
They will put things in order.

138
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:02,415
I can explain...

139
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,719
Could you hold for a moment,
we need to check your passport?

140
00:23:20,873 --> 00:23:23,918
You speak English? - No.
- French? - No.

141
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:29,423
Italian? - No.
- Only Portuguese? - Yes, yes. - Forget it.

142
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:50,838
This is Rio.

143
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:43,683
Americano? Liz Taylor, Cadillac,
Hollywood, Cape Canaveral.

144
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:45,268
I know all America.

145
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:49,397
Polish it well. And the other one.

146
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:53,401
Francaise? Tour Eiffel, de Gaule,

147
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:58,114
Brigitte Bardot... I know.
Five cruzeiros.

148
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,241
I don't have any.

149
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:11,627
Go your way.

150
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:28,519
Fifty.

151
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:36,152
Here. - Thanks

152
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,613
What am I doing here?

153
00:26:45,578 --> 00:26:47,997
What is your name?
- Sir Winston. - What?

154
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:50,750
Sir Winston.
- Bye Sir Winston.

155
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,506
Where are you going?
- I'm looking for a girl. - Girls!

156
00:26:56,506 --> 00:26:57,632
I know where. Let's go.

157
00:26:57,632 --> 00:27:03,054
No, my girl Agnes.
- Agnes? Is she pretty?

158
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:08,059
Lost in Rio. They kidnapped her
and I don't know where she is.

159
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:45,990
Wait.

160
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:24,237
Here, here!

161
00:29:58,604 --> 00:29:59,647
What's wrong?

162
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:03,901
Call the ambulance.

163
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:19,166
Hey. What's a matter with you?

164
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:28,009
Please mister, it's mine.
- Yes, yes.

165
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:34,890
If you don't mind, give it back. It's mine. Give it back!
- Stay away!

166
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:47,486
What did you see? - Let's go.

167
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,543
Miss Villermosa.
- She isn't here.

168
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:05,129
A French woman, she came with two local losers.

169
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:11,677
Tell me only the number of her room.

170
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:19,560
I may not tell you this.
- Right, I'll find it out on my own.

171
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,481
If you insist, sir, we'll have to kick you out.

172
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,025
Don't worry, I'll still find her.

173
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,917
My dear!
- What?

174
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:48,673
Don't you remember me? - No.
So you know Pickwick?

175
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:53,469
Of course I know this old saber.
After you, madam.

176
00:31:55,555 --> 00:31:57,932
I'm glad that you like him.
- Yes, yes.

177
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:07,233
It is very kind of you.
- No problem.

178
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:14,657
Pickwick, now we'll have our nice
afternoon cup of tea.

179
00:32:14,657 --> 00:32:17,368
What would he do without his tea.
You know how chidren are. - Yes.

180
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:22,373
We'll be delighted to see you again.
- Oh, thank you.

181
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:27,211
Goodbye, goodbye. - I hope to see you soon.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

182
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:50,876
Agnes, do you hear me? Wake up.
What have they done to you?

183
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:55,554
Wake up!
- What do you want?

184
00:33:57,876 --> 00:34:02,554
Let's go, do you hear me?
- Stop shaking me!

185
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,418
These scumbags drugged her.

186
00:34:42,211 --> 00:34:44,213
Look at me, Agnes.

187
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:50,302
Get up.

188
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:57,101
Smile, walk.

189
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:22,042
Agnes, go to the door and don't stop.

190
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,653
Where is she?
Where are you going?

191
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,452
Walk.

192
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:25,105
Goodbye.
- Let's go

193
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:29,818
Did you get the friends?

194
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,483
Wake up.

195
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:14,113
Wake up!

196
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,449
These lousy scumbags!

197
00:37:33,924 --> 00:37:38,137
How pleasant.
And this looks like waves.

198
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:48,147
Agnes!

199
00:37:48,147 --> 00:37:51,150
Of course these are waves.
And this is a sea.

200
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:58,449
Because we are in Rio.
- Rio?

201
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:02,661
Yes, Rio de Janeiro. Brazil.

202
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:08,834
Do you understand?
- Brazil! Brazil.

203
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:24,266
Stop!
- Some man.

204
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:28,729
Don't you remember me?
- No. I don't care who you are, forget it.

205
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:31,357
Get yourself together. - You look handsome.
Something like this never happens.

206
00:38:31,357 --> 00:38:35,778
She doesn't know me anymore.
- What a nice surprise.

207
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:46,455
Pleasant music, no one on the beach.
Thank you, handsome. - Stop it already.

208
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:48,957
These scumbags!

209
00:38:57,675 --> 00:38:58,592
What does he say?

210
00:39:01,095 --> 00:39:07,017
We shouldn't sleep on the beach, we must go.

211
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:08,435
I'm sleepy.

212
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:13,983
We go to my house.

213
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,414
Come, sweetheart!

214
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:43,137
You live here?
- Yes. Come!

215
00:40:16,962 --> 00:40:21,133
She is beautiful!
- Believe me, she's heavy.

216
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:24,053
Bring me pink sheets.
- Do you hear her?

217
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:28,015
She always wants
what I don't have.

218
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:31,977
If I say something
it's like talking to the wall.

219
00:40:31,977 --> 00:40:33,646
She doesn't listen at all.

220
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:35,648
Woman means that she waits for you at home.

221
00:40:35,648 --> 00:40:47,493
The woman is tender, understanding.
When you come home in the evening...

222
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:52,748
...you see her in the living room
playing the piano. Or the harp.

223
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:58,212
Love at home for whom it has.
This water still doesn't know how to boil.

224
00:40:58,712 --> 00:41:02,757
I'm chasing her around the world.
Is this normal? - I know. Scotch?

225
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:12,726
Chin, chin!

226
00:41:57,662 --> 00:42:03,000
Where am I?
Adrien! What are you doing here?

227
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:05,753
Where am I? Agnes!

228
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:10,216
A... Agnes. Everything is alright.

229
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:13,344
Finally you are back to yourself. Look.

230
00:42:17,223 --> 00:42:21,310
What is this? How beautiful.
- Rio.

231
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:25,481
Rio? - It's quite simple.
Yesterday I arrived with Lebel in Paris.

232
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:29,736
I went to your place...
- Dreadful!

233
00:42:29,736 --> 00:42:35,491
Wonderful. - What will it be? Dreadful or wonderful?
- The icecream is wonderful, what happened is dreadful.

234
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:38,661
You are nailed. Better stop this.

235
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:40,705
Do you think that I'm having fun?
They can shoot me for this.

236
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:43,708
You and your statuettes, Indians
and profesor Batactan...

237
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:47,295
Catalan. Don't mix the poor man into this.
- Alright, why did they kidnap him.

238
00:42:47,295 --> 00:42:51,257
And you... - They didn't dare?
- Don't get upset.

239
00:42:51,257 --> 00:42:57,054
There's more reasons to kidnap me.
Only I know where the statuette is hidden.

240
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:59,640
You aren't clear?
- So?

241
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,520
I plan to tell them where the statuette is.
They made a mistake.

242
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:07,273
Where are you going?
- Come, come!

243
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:09,692
Where?
- Just come along.

244
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,126
We lived here with my father.

245
00:43:28,836 --> 00:43:32,173
You don't like it.
- Yes, yes, beautiful. - Look!

246
00:43:33,216 --> 00:43:36,427
The dog house.
What a sweetheart he was.

247
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:39,764
His name was Pilou.
Bernard, with a blind eye.

248
00:43:39,764 --> 00:43:46,395
The chambermaid broke it with the broom.
- Beautiful...

249
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:50,817
How beautiful. - You didn't come to look around.
- You're right. Wait here.

250
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:09,836
I stood here when father came from the house.

251
00:44:09,836 --> 00:44:11,421
Go to the end of the garden.

252
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:18,594
Further back. Go, go...

253
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:23,433
To the left.
You're clumsy.

254
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:29,939
Where are you? I don't see you.
- Here. - Further back.

255
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:41,993
Quickly, quickly!
Straight. Go! Stay!

256
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:49,083
That's good. I remember
that he stood herel.

257
00:44:51,043 --> 00:44:54,505
Where is the aviary?
- This all is an aviary.

258
00:44:54,505 --> 00:45:00,553
At the time there weren't so many plants.
- This is life: from seed to plant.

259
00:45:00,553 --> 00:45:07,894
Give me the shovel.
No, no, no, no.

260
00:45:07,894 --> 00:45:09,812
Yes.
- Shovel.

261
00:45:22,992 --> 00:45:24,952
Come on, I'm waiting!

262
00:45:43,012 --> 00:45:44,889
Isn't it wonderful?

263
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:54,440
Run.

264
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:29,642
You asked for it!

265
00:46:48,453 --> 00:46:54,292
Adrien! Help me!
Adrien, save me!

266
00:47:00,047 --> 00:47:00,965
The statuette!

267
00:47:04,802 --> 00:47:08,055
What's the problem?
- I'm warning you, don't point a gun at me.

268
00:47:08,222 --> 00:47:12,185
Are you crazy? We need it.
- Adrien, what did I tell you? -  I'm going.

269
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:25,031
Why do the bad guys always win?
- They still don't know with whom they play.

270
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:26,407
There's a surprise waiting for them.

271
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:32,205
Where did they go?
- You know, I can't tell you this.

272
00:47:32,205 --> 00:47:35,041
Where did they go?
- I don't know, miss.

273
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:38,836
They have two statuettes. There's one left.
- Di Castro's.

274
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:41,839
Is he from Rio?
- Yes, I think.

275
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,007
Most probably he's in the phone directory.

276
00:47:43,007 --> 00:47:51,140
How do you spell it? - The way you pronounce it.
- As a member of the expedition he's next.

277
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,813
But I won't allow this.
- Stop talking and search. - Aha, di Castro.

278
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:03,486
Mr. di Castro is on the ship.

279
00:48:07,865 --> 00:48:11,994
There he is. - Easy.
- We must be fast.

280
00:48:11,994 --> 00:48:14,330
We have to warn him.
- We have to get such a boat.

281
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:20,795
What if we are already too late?
What if they already killed him, stabbed him?

282
00:48:22,964 --> 00:48:26,509
The ship is his grave on the water.
- You're right, let's go.

283
00:48:26,509 --> 00:48:29,303
Damn! Only your mouth works.
- Watch your language.

284
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:31,055
You're right, I'll go alone.

285
00:48:36,686 --> 00:48:38,729
Wait! Are you crazy?

286
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:42,608
You'll attract attention.
- I'm not afraid of the water.

287
00:48:42,608 --> 00:48:46,279
Did you learn to swim?
- No, why? - I will go.

288
00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:50,867
Don't worry.
Just don't move until I come back.

289
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:56,330
I'll be back right away.
- I'm not good enough anymore.

290
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:02,105
Is anyone here?

291
00:50:21,457 --> 00:50:24,085
Hands up.
- I will explain...

292
00:51:44,707 --> 00:51:46,417
Towards the shore, darling.

293
00:53:11,252 --> 00:53:14,839
I gave up my country, family,
army and friends, crossed the ocean...

294
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:18,176
...so that I could see miss Agnes,
to kick the nosy potlids.

295
00:53:18,176 --> 00:53:19,218
Is this normal?

296
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:42,158
Adrien, try it, it's not difficult.
- I'd rather die.

297
00:53:45,244 --> 00:53:50,625
You dared a lot to leave me alone.
Did you find di Castro?

298
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:53,461
No.
- Wasn't he on the ship? - No.

299
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:58,341
Is there something wrong? - No.
- You're angry, aren't you?

300
00:53:58,341 --> 00:54:01,427
You have Rio at your feet.
You can manage alone quite well.

301
00:54:01,427 --> 00:54:04,597
This is for you. Bye, darling.
In 4 days I have an appointment with Lebel...

302
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:08,142
...at the station under the clock. It was nice.

303
00:54:08,893 --> 00:54:10,478
If I start something, I finish it.

304
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:15,608
The statuette! - Mr. di Castro.
- You know him?

305
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:17,568
I know him.
- Where is he?

306
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,990
He went by plane?
- Where? - To Brasilia.

307
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:26,702
Adrien, did you hear? He's in Brasilia.
We can still catch him.

308
00:54:26,702 --> 00:54:32,583
Why not? It's not far, we'll get the subway.
Do you have a ticket? Here.

309
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:33,626
Smell it.

310
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:41,843
If you loved me, you wouldn't make fun.
- I still haven't proven my love to you?

311
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:43,678
Words don't prove anything.

312
00:54:43,678 --> 00:54:48,182
How far is Brasilia?
- Thousand, two thousand kilometers.

313
00:54:48,182 --> 00:54:53,104
We'll need a car.
- I know. - Exactly!

314
00:54:53,104 --> 00:54:57,650
You have to choose the color.
- Pink with small green stars.

315
00:55:04,282 --> 00:55:07,744
Look at this little house! Butterflies!

316
00:55:10,788 --> 00:55:16,377
What is this? Look.
- Pole. - No, that.

317
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:17,754
Telegraph pole.

318
00:55:18,546 --> 00:55:23,050
For all this you see poles.
- Leave me alone.

319
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:28,639
You are ridiculous. How could you be insensitive
to the beauty of the world?

320
00:55:29,807 --> 00:55:33,895
Listen! A deserter in a stolen car
with a hyterical woman...

321
00:55:33,895 --> 00:55:37,356
...is a moron or a drug addict,
but is not insensitive. So what am I?

322
00:55:37,356 --> 00:55:41,319
Let's go. - If I want to.
- I'll get out? - If you want to.

323
00:55:42,862 --> 00:55:45,448
You always get what you want.

324
00:56:04,092 --> 00:56:06,803
Pull!
- That's what I'm doing.

325
00:56:06,803 --> 00:56:15,311
Where does it lock? - Find it out.
- Why should I be doing everything?

326
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:19,148
Pay attention! Don't let it lose!
- But I hold it!

327
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:26,864
Get up, what are you doing?
- Yes, sergeant. At once, sergeant.

328
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:30,827
On the floor! On your feet!
On the floor! On your feet!

329
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:41,462
How sweet you are in your underwear.
Angry?

330
00:56:42,213 --> 00:56:43,589
Answer me!

331
00:56:47,218 --> 00:56:48,928
Come back!
This is the police.

332
00:56:55,768 --> 00:57:00,106
Sir, could you, please, arrest me?
I deserted...

333
00:57:00,106 --> 00:57:04,485
...lost my uniform and flew
with the stolen ticket of some invalid.

334
00:57:04,485 --> 00:57:07,238
I fought with men
of all colors and nations...

335
00:57:07,238 --> 00:57:12,618
...and I drive around in a stolen
pink car with little green stars.

336
00:57:12,618 --> 00:57:18,040
I'm also guilty of public indecency.

337
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,168
Sir, the handcuffs! Please.

338
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:24,881
Soldier Dufourquet, third squadron.
French airforce. Do you understand?

339
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:30,052
No, eh?
Only Rio and Brasilia.

340
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:34,932
Ah, Brasilia? 50 km.
- Too bad that I don't smuggle something.

341
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,577
Look!
- Yes, I know. Butterflies with ears.

342
00:57:54,577 --> 00:57:59,373
Stop, the green car. It's the professor.
Stop, it's Catalan!

343
00:57:59,373 --> 00:58:05,588
Who, Catalan?
- The professor is alive. We must save him.

344
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:06,631
Let's do it!

345
00:58:11,844 --> 00:58:13,054
Hold the steering wheel.

346
00:58:35,952 --> 00:58:39,705
No! No! No!

347
00:58:40,915 --> 00:58:42,750
Quickly, so you don't end up there.

348
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,303
Professor!
- You'll hug him afterwards.

349
00:58:56,806 --> 00:58:58,891
Let's go, fast! Step on the gas.

350
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:15,474
Agnes! How come you are here?

351
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:20,312
They kidnapped me... and Adrien,
my fiance, saved me.

352
00:59:20,312 --> 00:59:22,814
He has a leave.
- Keep your eyes on the road! - Thank you.

353
00:59:22,814 --> 00:59:25,192
Don't mention it.
- What have they done to you?

354
00:59:26,401 --> 00:59:30,322
First they kidnapped me.
- And we meet on the road to Brasilia.

355
00:59:31,073 --> 00:59:35,202
Where are we going?
- To warn di Castro.

356
00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:37,746
- To warn him?

357
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,877
We must warn him before they get him.

358
00:59:45,462 --> 00:59:49,675
I was afraid that they had killed you.
- No, no.

359
00:59:50,509 --> 00:59:55,305
Only I know the secret of the statuettes.

360
00:59:55,305 --> 01:00:00,352
Secret! I haven't come to play
cowboys and Indians.

361
01:00:00,352 --> 01:00:03,438
I still have three days of leave left.
- Don't think only about yourself!

362
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:36,471
Everywhere there'll be windows,
everywhere only glass.

363
01:00:37,597 --> 01:00:41,393
So that it will be bright, full of glare
and transparent light.

364
01:00:42,394 --> 01:00:47,357
Like a butterfly wing.
Such shall be the building.

365
01:00:47,357 --> 01:00:50,027
I insist.
Let's go!

366
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:00,412
Norbert!

367
01:01:10,964 --> 01:01:15,677
Let's go to my place for a drink.
We'll talk there.

368
01:01:54,758 --> 01:01:58,845
This is my hiding place.
Not at all.

369
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:04,184
Ah, my fountains. Not really from Versailles,
but still cool. I hate these plants.

370
01:02:04,184 --> 01:02:05,477
We'll throw them out!

371
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:11,358
No, no, no!
There won't be such crashings in my house.

372
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:13,110
Go!

373
01:02:16,363 --> 01:02:19,449
The statuette is safe.
This is the jewel in my collection...

374
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:22,619
...my most precious memory.

375
01:02:25,455 --> 01:02:26,289
My youth.

376
01:02:27,249 --> 01:02:30,752
And you? Still single?
You still wear a suit too small?

377
01:02:32,004 --> 01:02:36,299
Do you like the new Brasilia?
- Very much. - And Brasilians?

378
01:02:38,135 --> 01:02:42,097
How strong it is!
- I know her since she was in diapers.

379
01:02:42,097 --> 01:02:45,892
Everything grows: the world grows
and shoots sprouts...

380
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:52,357
...that grow like my city.
This was wilderness three years ago.

381
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,194
Then some of us got together...

382
01:02:57,237 --> 01:03:01,824
...and this is what happened.
- You are wonderful!

383
01:03:02,743 --> 01:03:06,413
Only you haven't changed, Norbert.

384
01:03:06,413 --> 01:03:09,666
I followed your work about the Malteks.
Wonderful.

385
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:15,547
You are still such a dreamer, no?
- You don't believe me? - I'm a busy man...

386
01:03:15,547 --> 01:03:21,762
...and I don't have time for daydreams.
But you aren't... - A loser?

387
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:28,018
Come on. You are wonderful!
- Mario, the statuette.

388
01:03:28,018 --> 01:03:29,728
We shouldn't bore the guests.
- They won't mind at all.

389
01:03:29,728 --> 01:03:33,982
Would you like to see the statuette?
Here it is!

390
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:52,084
Imitation.
- Bravo! The eyes of an expert.

391
01:03:55,212 --> 01:03:57,172
It's fake.
I have a few of these.

392
01:03:57,172 --> 01:04:02,594
The real one is hidden. - Where?
- Did you think in the living room?

393
01:04:02,594 --> 01:04:06,682
Where so many people pass by?
- Good. And me?

394
01:04:06,682 --> 01:04:10,852
Is there a problem?
- Our friend is in an unusual situation.

395
01:04:10,852 --> 01:04:14,815
He must be in Paris on Monday.
- Come, you have my word.

396
01:04:14,815 --> 01:04:15,857
I will arrange everything.

397
01:04:19,069 --> 01:04:23,240
Tonight there will be a hydroplane
available to Mr. Catalan. - Tonight?!

398
01:04:23,281 --> 01:04:24,324
Correct, in the morning before daybreak.

399
01:04:26,243 --> 01:04:31,790
Tonight you are my guests. - My leave...
- That's not important. I know that you are reasonable.

400
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:34,835
I'll introduce to you my wife.
Norma!

401
01:04:36,003 --> 01:04:38,255
Friends from France.
We'll quickly prepare something...

402
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:43,010
...and have entertainment.

403
01:05:29,765 --> 01:05:31,725
That's you!
- Unbeatable.

404
01:05:31,725 --> 01:05:39,358
They call me so because I always win.

405
01:05:42,903 --> 01:05:47,491
Cheers. Agnes, your eyes spill out.
- Spill out? - Full with anger and promises.

406
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:53,455
- Really?
- Your eyes are whispering, murmuring.

407
01:05:53,455 --> 01:05:56,249
Stop throbbing! I hate noise.

408
01:05:56,291 --> 01:06:00,462
Where did we stop?
- My eyes are spilling out.

409
01:06:02,214 --> 01:06:04,508
You are frightening me.
- I hope, dear.

410
01:06:04,591 --> 01:06:10,097
I took off.
The flames from the ship were high.

411
01:06:10,097 --> 01:06:12,265
Suddenly I notice that I burn.
And I'm 5km above ground.

412
01:06:12,265 --> 01:06:15,352
It was just for laughter.

413
01:06:17,104 --> 01:06:19,982
What is so funny?
- He's lying.

414
01:06:19,982 --> 01:06:24,444
Before the flight to Rio he still hadn't been in mid air.
- Just a second, girls.

415
01:06:24,444 --> 01:06:25,487
Just a second, girls.

416
01:06:27,364 --> 01:06:29,449
You're witty.
- Don't neglect me.

417
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:34,371
Be glad for what I still do for you?
- I'm not joking.

418
01:06:35,247 --> 01:06:39,876
I think that I love you.
- There's really no dragon which I have to kill for you?

419
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:44,631
It's over with the dragons.
- Whom do I shoot? Save? I can retire.

420
01:06:44,631 --> 01:06:49,803
The slippers, mom!
- This will come. Kiss me.

421
01:06:49,803 --> 01:06:50,971
Only if you'll be happy.

422
01:07:52,074 --> 01:07:57,162
Mario, show me the statuette.
- My friend...

423
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:03,293
...drink a bit. You didn't drink at all.
- No.

424
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:07,214
Are you afraid that you'll be poisoned?

425
01:08:08,882 --> 01:08:14,805
Like the father of Agnes.
- Why are you saying this? - You're nervous.

426
01:08:15,514 --> 01:08:20,102
This is expected after all that happened.
- Is the statuette really safe?

427
01:08:20,102 --> 01:08:23,855
Sure.
- I'd like to see it. - You're joking.

428
01:08:25,232 --> 01:08:27,067
You're right that you want reassurance.

429
01:08:29,861 --> 01:08:33,615
As long as I guard it, it's not in any danger.

430
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,619
Trust me. Come.

431
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:44,668
Come on, come.

432
01:09:10,694 --> 01:09:13,238
After you.

433
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:28,795
Do you still believe in Maltek's treasure?
- More than anyone else.

434
01:09:28,795 --> 01:09:32,507
And the answer is in the three statuettes?
- As if you didn't know.

435
01:09:59,284 --> 01:10:00,535
Enter.

436
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:11,463
Wonderful.
- I keep here the best pieces. My treasures.

437
01:10:11,463 --> 01:10:12,506
And the statuette?

438
01:10:49,626 --> 01:10:50,877
So?

439
01:10:58,093 --> 01:10:58,760
Yes.

440
01:11:34,629 --> 01:11:39,968
I waited three years for this.
Three years of preparations.

441
01:11:45,182 --> 01:11:51,688
You make fun of me
that I wear a suit too small.

442
01:11:54,191 --> 01:11:58,070
But this loser will soon be
richer than you.

443
01:13:50,057 --> 01:13:51,683
Wait below.

444
01:13:59,441 --> 01:14:03,236
We lead! - You try.
- Are you having fun?

445
01:14:03,236 --> 01:14:06,031
Where were you?
- Here, Agnes.

446
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:21,129
Where is di Castro?
- He left because he was tired.

447
01:14:21,129 --> 01:14:24,716
I already said goodbye so we can go.

448
01:14:24,716 --> 01:14:28,553
No, as long as we're winning.
I missed!

449
01:14:28,553 --> 01:14:32,140
Forget about this stupid game.
I have to tell you something.

450
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:02,087
20 points. - I tell you for the last time.
- I'll throw one more time...

451
01:15:02,129 --> 01:15:04,589
...and then we'll go.
I promise.

452
01:15:08,593 --> 01:15:12,681
It hurts!
- My patience has a limit.You won't play with me...

453
01:15:12,681 --> 01:15:16,018
...like with your own foolish lovers.
- Nobody complained. - How unfortunate!

454
01:15:17,352 --> 01:15:22,107
You won't make a scene.
- It's your turn, Agnes.

455
01:15:22,107 --> 01:15:23,317
I'll do it.

456
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,208
Agnes!

457
01:15:48,175 --> 01:15:50,052
Wait, Adrien calls.

458
01:22:12,809 --> 01:22:16,021
Agnes, don't worry! I'm coming!

459
01:22:38,293 --> 01:22:43,382
A call for you. Mother is calling.

460
01:22:57,771 --> 01:23:02,025
Calm down, don't panic.
What's written in the book?

461
01:23:06,571 --> 01:23:10,242
Pull the control lever.
Slowly.

462
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,414
Slowly, slowly.

463
01:24:58,391 --> 01:24:59,725
Agnes!

464
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,626
Everywhere there's only water.

465
01:25:53,295 --> 01:25:57,341
Man would need a ponton.
I'll jump.

466
01:26:17,194 --> 01:26:19,780
No, that's not for me.
I thought it over.

467
01:26:40,467 --> 01:26:42,094
Now!

468
01:28:06,762 --> 01:28:08,805
I got him, the devil!

469
01:28:15,187 --> 01:28:18,065
Also a Frenchman? It's a small world.
Where from?

470
01:28:18,065 --> 01:28:21,735
Besancon.
- And they say that we stay only at home.

471
01:28:21,735 --> 01:28:24,154
Where are we going?
- We're going to drink.

472
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:37,876
More?
- Yes.

473
01:29:10,242 --> 01:29:15,747
You'll like it here. They have everything:
girls, drinks and music.

474
01:29:15,747 --> 01:29:19,960
Paradise, my friend.
True paradise.

475
01:29:41,815 --> 01:29:44,026
Where are these two going?
- The gorillas? - Yes.

476
01:29:44,026 --> 01:29:49,448
They go to Loli, like everyone.
Come, I'll show you.

477
01:30:45,003 --> 01:30:48,924
Do you like her?
This is Lola.

478
01:30:48,924 --> 01:30:53,220
In this golden throat there's a hidden character.
The girl rules the town.

479
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:55,722
She has a business head.
Drink.

480
01:31:01,478 --> 01:31:02,688
Listen.

481
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:24,626
Calm down, drink something.

482
01:31:46,523 --> 01:31:50,861
Good luck comes your way.
- With your help.

483
01:31:51,737 --> 01:31:55,741
Help is worthy of gold.
- He's very effective, right?

484
01:31:56,575 --> 01:32:01,079
I know how to choose men.
- The boat is wonderful.

485
01:32:01,872 --> 01:32:03,999
Give me money for the crew.

486
01:32:07,711 --> 01:32:12,299
Your fairy tale is very expensive to me.
- A few more days...

487
01:32:12,341 --> 01:32:15,844
...and I'll repay you a thousand times.

488
01:32:19,723 --> 01:32:24,811
I don't believe you any more.
Things I make for you.

489
01:32:26,897 --> 01:32:30,776
These statuettes are the key to the secret.

490
01:32:30,776 --> 01:32:33,612
And only I discovered it.

491
01:32:36,823 --> 01:32:37,783
Look.

492
01:32:42,204 --> 01:32:43,038
One...

493
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:49,878
Two...

494
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:55,926
Three.

495
01:33:06,395 --> 01:33:09,523
The key is in the light.
Listen:

496
01:33:10,482 --> 01:33:16,280
"At the source of the river, the sun melts the rocks".

497
01:33:17,364 --> 01:33:21,618
"And when you enter the holy pit,
the dead light will become alive".

498
01:33:22,327 --> 01:33:26,873
Diamondes, tons of diamonds.
The famous treasure of the Malteks.

499
01:33:26,873 --> 01:33:30,335
Of course.
- You still don't believe me?

500
01:33:30,335 --> 01:33:35,757
I know what it will be when you find the stones.
- I'll give you a half. - And Agnes?

501
01:33:35,799 --> 01:33:40,137
What is she doing here? - Quiet!
- First you kill her father...

502
01:33:40,137 --> 01:33:46,351
...and then you show up with her.
- Only she knew where the statuette was.

503
01:33:46,351 --> 01:33:50,647
You needed her in Rio, not here.
- Enough! Don't monetion her anymore.

504
01:33:50,647 --> 01:33:54,735
Never!
- Alright, alright.

505
01:34:18,133 --> 01:34:20,510
He's here?
- What's wrong?

506
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:23,722
Some Parisian followed us.
- I'll arrange it.

507
01:34:32,564 --> 01:34:36,526
Is there anybody from Paris here?
- Me!

508
01:34:37,861 --> 01:34:39,613
You, right?
- Yes, madam.

509
01:34:39,613 --> 01:34:46,411
It's me.
- Come on, Chita!

510
01:35:12,437 --> 01:35:13,355
You hog!

511
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:51,018
You from the right, me from the left.

512
01:37:39,418 --> 01:37:40,919
Hey, Manuel!

513
01:37:49,594 --> 01:37:51,722
Could you help me? Thanks.

514
01:38:20,374 --> 01:38:22,835
Don't leave me alone!

515
01:38:28,324 --> 01:38:29,408
Agnes!

516
01:40:14,354 --> 01:40:15,897
You are a monster!

517
01:40:15,939 --> 01:40:17,691
Do you really believe in this?

518
01:40:18,525 --> 01:40:19,610
What do you think?

519
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:21,194
I'm enchanted!

520
01:40:23,155 --> 01:40:26,283
After the discovery, my work
became appreciated, it's fascinating!

521
01:40:26,283 --> 01:40:27,826
I needed a lot of time.

522
01:40:27,868 --> 01:40:32,914
You don't believe in my secret
and you don't see these beauties.

523
01:40:32,914 --> 01:40:36,335
Besides, you're still in love with this poor Adrien.

524
01:40:36,752 --> 01:40:40,589
Forget him. Come with me!

525
01:40:41,465 --> 01:40:44,593
Together we'll become right and enjoy glory!

526
01:40:46,178 --> 01:40:53,477
I had to use force, it came to that.

527
01:40:55,228 --> 01:40:58,982
What should I do with you?

528
01:40:59,942 --> 01:41:08,200
Could you tell me?
I don't know.

529
01:41:12,162 --> 01:41:15,999
Think about my proposal.

530
01:41:15,999 --> 01:41:18,835
See you tomorrow.

531
01:41:37,938 --> 01:41:38,939
Adrien!

532
01:41:50,325 --> 01:41:53,203
I love you.
And do you?

533
01:42:01,003 --> 01:42:02,379
What me?

534
01:42:17,185 --> 01:42:22,608
We are going to the spring with the boat.
Two come with me, the others not.

535
01:45:40,764 --> 01:45:46,270
That's it. No doubt, we arrived.

536
01:45:47,479 --> 01:45:52,401
Wait. - I can't anymore.
- A few more minutes...

537
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:54,111
...and this will be the end of my effort.

538
01:45:57,114 --> 01:46:02,327
2, 3, 4...
Here!

539
01:50:15,631 --> 01:50:16,840
Where is Catalan?

540
01:51:50,631 --> 01:51:51,840
Agnes!

541
01:54:08,153 --> 01:54:11,865
Do they still shoot deserters?
- Because I still have two days.

542
01:54:11,865 --> 01:54:13,825
More than enough.

543
01:54:31,993 --> 01:54:35,997
Have you seen Lebel? - No.
- He'll be late.

544
01:54:39,583 --> 01:54:43,087
Run, run! Jump!

545
01:54:43,087 --> 01:54:47,383
Look, what... - Wait. I was running so fast!
Let me catch my breath.

546
01:54:47,383 --> 01:54:51,554
I brought you something. - Nice.
If you would know what I went through.

547
01:54:51,554 --> 01:54:56,976
What happened?
- I walked for three hours, three hours!

548
01:54:56,976 --> 01:55:00,187
From where?
- From home. I've crossed whole Paris.

549
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:03,024
What an adventure.

550
