157
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,656
"would understand how she felt"

158
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,950
"on finding this treasure"

159
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,829
"hidden by a little boy 40 years ago."

160
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,920
"On August 31st at 4am,"

161
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:33,006
"Amélie has a dazzling idea."

162
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,593
"Wherever he was,
she would find the box's owner"

163
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,971
"and give him back his treasure."

164
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:43,767
"If he was touched,
she'd become a regular do-gooder."

165
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,811
"If not, too bad."

166
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:56,571
The girl from the 5th floor!
We don't see much of you.

167
00:15:56,613 --> 00:16:00,909
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the '50s?

168
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:03,203
A boy? Come and have a glass of port.

169
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:07,791
- No, thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

170
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:11,962
Boys? I've known so many.

171
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:16,299
They're cute until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

172
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,426
I've known so many boys.

173
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:22,013
- When did you come here?
- In '64.

174
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:24,808
You'll have heard the story.

175
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,060
No, I don't think so.

176
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:28,937
I'm amazed. Sit down.

177
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:33,650
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.

178
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:37,153
It's no secret that he slept
with his secretary.

179
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:41,157
They used every hotel around.

180
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,909
Not the grotty ones, either.

181
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:46,287
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

182
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:47,830
but only on satin.

183
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:50,875
So my husband swiped from the till.

184
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,961
A little at first, then 50 million.

185
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:57,298
Off they flew to South America.

186
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:00,593
Drink up.

187
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:05,681
On January 20th 1970,

188
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:08,142
my doorbell rang.

189
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:13,272
«Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America.»

190
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,442
My life stopped there.

191
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:19,654
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.

192
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,531
Poor creature.

193
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:27,161
See how lovingly

194
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:29,246
he still stares at his master?

195
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:31,332
One day

196
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:32,875
I'll read you his letters.

197
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,669
No, don't go!

198
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,171
You can spare five minutes.

199
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:38,881
He wrote this

200
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:40,591
from the barracks.

201
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,678
«Darling Mado.» That's me.

202
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,388
I'm called Madeleine.

203
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:49,433
«I can't sleep, can't eat,»

204
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:54,271
«knowing that my only reason
to live is far away in Paris.»

205
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,732
«I won't see her until a fortnight
on Friday,»

206
00:17:56,815 --> 00:18:02,571
«when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station»

207
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:05,699
«in her strappy blue dress.»

208
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:09,787
In brackets: «The one you think
too see-through.»

209
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:20,672
Has anyone ever written to you like that?

210
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:24,802
No. I'm nobody's little weasel.

211
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:27,429
My name's Madeleine Walace.

212
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:30,557
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

213
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,102
She wept, right? And Walace
as Wallace Fountains.

214
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:38,357
Talk about being born to cry!

215
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:43,779
About your question...

216
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:49,284
Ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

217
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:53,000
Hello, Amélie-melo!
"[Joke:Add «mélo» to Amélie
to mean «méli-mélo» as mishmash]"

218
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,313
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?

219
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:58,168
Who lived in my flat in the '50s?

220
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,214
- What was their name?
- You've got me there, dear.

221
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:06,218
In 1950, I was two.
The mental age of this cretin.

222
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:07,886
"The «cretin» is Lucien."

223
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:11,973
"He's no genius, but Amélie likes him.
She likes the way"

224
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:15,352
"he handles each witloof
like a precious object"

225
00:19:15,393 --> 00:19:18,605
"to be treated with care.
It's his way of showing"

226
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,065
"his love of good work."

227
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:21,149
Look at him!

228
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:25,653
Like he's nursing a baby bird
that's fallen out of its nest!

229
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:28,405
Don't ask him for currants!

230
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:30,033
You'd be here till Monday!

231
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:33,244
Get moving, spastic!

232
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,330
She hasn't got all day.

233
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,376
Here.

234
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:44,130
Go and see my mother.
She has the memory of an elephant.

235
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:47,441
Elephant Mum!
[sea elephant: Mum and sea have
the same pronunciation in French (Joke)]

236
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,135
Thank you.

237
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:08,863
Bredoteau.

238
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,491
Sorry?

239
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:13,326
It's the name you're after.

240
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:17,788
But if it's me that says so,
it won't count. I'm senile.

241
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:19,790
Ignore him. He's senile.

242
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,919
See what he's done to my laurel?

243
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:29,717
His old job was punching métro tickets.

244
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,972
For three months now,
he's got up every night to punch holes

245
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:38,517
- in my laurels!
- I'd have preferred lilacs. Such is life!

246
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,022
- We all need a way to relax.
- I skim stones.

247
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:47,234
- You do?
- I'll find it. Don't worry.

248
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:50,237
- I file everything.
- Like what?

249
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:55,075
Your son's nearly 50
and I'm still doing his book-keeping.

250
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:59,830
You were still squeezing his toothpaste
at 15, so it follows.

251
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:02,249
Right. Camus...

252
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:06,295
2nd floor on the right. Brossard...
Brossard was on staircase B.

253
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:07,922
Got it!

254
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,090
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.

255
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:12,885
They were from the Pas de Calais.

256
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:15,554
Bredoteau. What more can I say?

257
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,997
"Groping under the photo booth
is Nino Quincampoix."

258
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:33,131
"When Amélie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many."

259
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:49,339
"Five miles apart, one dreamed
of having a sister, the other a brother"

260
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:51,441
"to spend all their time with."

261
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,130
Hi, Dad.

262
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:17,133
A new friend?

263
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:20,386
No, I've had him for years.

264
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,348
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

265
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,393
There. Let's reconcile them.

266
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:32,899
There. Not bad, eh?

267
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:42,241
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,

268
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:46,162
how would it make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic? What?

269
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:49,749
I didn't have this gnome
when I was a child.

270
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:53,419
He was a retirement gift
from my old regiment.

271
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:57,923
No, I mean something you hid
like a secret treasure.

272
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:01,552
I should varnish him before autumn.

273
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:08,100
I'll make some tea. Do you want some?

274
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:10,227
Breathe in. Hold still.

275
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:14,023
Better now?

276
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:15,941
Shut the door!

277
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:18,027
There's a howling gale.

278
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,070
It's hardly Siberia.

279
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:22,698
I can see you're not allergic

280
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:27,411
to car fumes.
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

281
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:28,954
Coughed up a pleura? Sure.

282
00:24:29,037 --> 00:24:32,583
- What's on the menu today, Suzanne?
- «Endives au gratin».

283
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:35,085
They'll have you on your knees,
you'll see.

284
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:36,336
They're good, then?

285
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:38,589
- Depends where.
- If it's at the toilet...

286
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,923
Not good!

287
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,433
12:15, laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

288
00:24:49,474 --> 00:24:52,394
He's going to drive me berserk!

289
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:56,189
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars.

290
00:24:56,231 --> 00:24:58,191
Goodbye.

291
00:24:58,233 --> 00:24:59,484
Suzanne.

292
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:01,445
- Suzanne.
- Yes.

293
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:04,239
«au gratin» means white sauce, right?

294
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:05,907
Yes, why?

295
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:10,996
I can't stomach it.
Like you and horse meat.

296
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,790
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

297
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,626
I'd rather cook human flesh.

298
00:25:16,668 --> 00:25:18,712
You're kidding!

299
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:34,227
Suzanne, would you mind
if I left early today?

300
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:36,312
What's his name?

301
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:38,440
Dominique Bredoteau.

302
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:45,822
Hello.

303
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:48,867
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?

304
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,285
That's me.

305
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:52,328
Why?

306
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,455
It's about...

307
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,749
...the petition.

308
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:58,209
Petition?

309
00:25:58,293 --> 00:26:03,006
Yes. The petition to...

310
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:06,342
...to canonize Lady Di.

311
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:08,052
No, thanks.

312
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:09,137
No.

313
00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:19,522
"Ladies and gentlemen,
sorry to bother you..."

314
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:26,654
- Yes?
- Hello.

315
00:26:26,737 --> 00:26:30,366
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau
for the European census.

316
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:33,578
Come up. Third floor.

317
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:44,964
Hello, kitten.

318
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:49,552
Earl Grey?

319
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:51,679
Jasmine?

320
00:26:51,762 --> 00:26:54,765
What will you have?

321
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,104
I'm working.

322
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:11,782
"There. I'm coming."

323
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:16,203
Do you know where I can find
Dominique Bredoteau?

324
00:27:16,287 --> 00:27:18,539
Oh, my poor dear!

325
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:20,791
You just missed him.

326
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,586
Look, there he goes now.

327
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:35,097
Bre-to-deau.

328
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,016
Not Bre-do-teau.

329
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:39,935
You need

330
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:43,480
a glass of mulled wine.

331
00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:45,357
Come in.

332
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:46,650
Come on in.

333
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:54,283
I've lived here for five years.
This is the first time we've met.

334
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:57,119
I never go out on the landing.

335
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,164
I'm fussy about who I meet.

336
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:02,791
They're all creeps anyway.

337
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:07,587
Come in. Here.

338
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:09,005
Come in.

339
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,634
They call me the Glass Man,

340
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:16,263
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

341
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,685
- Amélie Poulain. I'm a waitress at...
- The Two Windmills. I know.

342
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:27,857
And you've come back empty-handed
from your search for Bretodeau.

343
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,612
Because it's not «do», it's «to».

344
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:35,198
- Like «Toto».
- Thank you.

345
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,704
I love that painting.

346
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:43,456
It's the «Luncheon Of The Boating Party».

347
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,209
By Renoir.

348
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:56,010
I've painted one each year
for twenty years.

349
00:28:57,637 --> 00:29:00,348
The hardest part is the looks.

350
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:06,479
I sometimes feel they deliberately change
their mood as soon as my back's turned.

351
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:08,189
They look quite happy there.

352
00:29:08,231 --> 00:29:10,525
They should be.

353
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:12,652
This year they had hare with morels.

354
00:29:13,903 --> 00:29:17,490
And waffles with jam for the children.

355
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:23,037
Now, what have I done
with that piece of paper?

356
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:30,545
Ah, you've noticed my video camera
at the window.

357
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:33,256
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

358
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,175
I put it there

359
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:39,136
so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

360
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:43,182
After all these years,

361
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:47,561
the only person I still can't capture

362
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:49,897
is the girl with the glass of water.

363
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,440
She's in the middle,

364
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:54,318
yet she's on the outside.

365
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:58,531
Maybe she's just different
from the others.

366
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:01,367
In what way?

367
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,453
I don't know.

368
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:09,750
When she was little, she can't
have played much with other children.

369
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:13,838
Maybe never.

370
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,926
Here.

371
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:22,930
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

372
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:25,516
It's for you.

373
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:31,730
"Every Tuesday morning,
Dominique Bretodeau goes to buy a chicken."

374
00:30:31,814 --> 00:30:34,900
"He usually roasts it
and has it with «sauté» potatoes."

375
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:38,237
"After carving the legs,
the breast and the wings,"

376
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,324
"he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers,"

377
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,034
"starting with the oysters."

378
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:51,041
"But not today.
Bretodeau won't buy a chicken."

379
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,543
"He'll go no further"

380
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,253
"than this phone booth here."

381
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,951
"In a flash, it all came back to him."

382
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,204
"Federico Bahamontes
winning the «Tour de France» in '59."

383
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:16,292
"Aunt Josette's slips."

384
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,923
"And most of all, that tragic day."

385
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,928
"That tragic day when he won
all the marbles at break time."

386
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,813
Bretodeau!

387
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,150
Bretodeau!

388
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:50,910
The pinch, Bretodeau!

389
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:53,037
Do you understand, Bretodeau?

390
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:02,129
Cognac, please.

391
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:10,221
It's amazing, what just happened to me.

392
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:14,475
It must be my guardian angel.
It's the only explanation.

393
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:16,977
It was as if the phone booth
was calling me.

394
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,438
It rang and rang.

395
00:33:21,982 --> 00:33:25,027
Same here. The microwave's calling me.

396
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,365
I'll have another cognac.

397
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,500
Life's strange.

398
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:46,423
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.

399
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:50,677
All that's left of your childhood

400
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,971
fits in a little box,

401
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:54,473
a little rusty box.

402
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,437
Have you got kids, miss?

403
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:08,195
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

404
00:34:11,948 --> 00:34:13,950
We haven't spoken for years.

405
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:17,954
I heard she had a child, a boy.

406
00:34:19,122 --> 00:34:20,165
His name is Lucas.

407
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:31,301
I think it's time I looked them up
before I'm in a box myself.

408
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:34,054
Don't you think?

409
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:46,024
"Amélie suddenly has a strange feeling
of complete harmony."

410
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:49,752
"It's a perfect moment.
Soft light, a scent in the air,"

411
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:52,063
"the quiet murmur of the city,"

412
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:56,576
"She breathes deeply.
Life seems so simple and clear."

413
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:01,414
"A surge of love, an urge to help
mankind suddenly engulfs her."

414
00:35:13,843 --> 00:35:16,429
Let me help you. Step down.

415
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:19,515
Off we go!
We just passed the drum major's widow!

416
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,560
She's worn his coat since the day he died.
Careful.

417
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:25,730
The horse's head on the butcher's
has lost an ear.

418
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:29,317
That's the florist laughing.
He has crinkly eyes.

419
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,445
In the bakery window there are lollipops!

420
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:34,280
Mmm. Smell that.

421
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:36,574
They're giving out melon slices.

422
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:40,703
Sugarplum ice cream!

423
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:43,455
We're passing the pork butcher.

424
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:45,875
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45!

425
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:50,755
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90, cabecous 23.50.

426
00:35:50,796 --> 00:35:55,384
At the butcher's a baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens roasting.

427
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:58,846
Now we're at the newspaper kiosk
by the métro.

428
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:00,973
I'll leave you here. Bye.

429
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:54,735
«She can't relate to other people.»

430
00:36:56,945 --> 00:36:59,823
«She was always a lonely child.»

431
00:37:02,826 --> 00:37:05,746
"On a sparkling evening in July,"

432
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:08,665
"while on the beaches holidaymakers"

433
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:11,293
"relax in the new-found sun,"

434
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,879
"and in Paris the sweltering crowds"

435
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:16,298
"gaze at the first bursts"

436
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:19,050
"of the traditional fireworks,
Amélie Poulain,"

437
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:22,804
"godmother of outcasts,"

438
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:25,348
"Madonna of the unloved,"

439
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,559
"finally succumbs to exhaustion."

440
00:37:27,642 --> 00:37:32,355
"In Paris' grief-stricken streets,"

441
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:35,233
"a vast throng of mourners"

442
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:38,403
"line her funeral route in silence"

443
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:42,908
"with the measureless sorrow
of newly orphaned children."

444
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,077
"What a strange destiny for one"

445
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:47,537
"who gave her all,"

446
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,251
"yet took such joy
in life's simple pleasures."

447
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:56,921
"Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself"

448
00:37:56,963 --> 00:38:00,133
"against the grinding windmill
of all life's miseries."

449
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:14,647
"It was a losing battle"

450
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:16,691
"that claimed her life too soon."

451
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:19,027
"At barely 23, Amélie Poulain"

452
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,697
"let her young, tired body merge"

453
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,159
"with the ebb and flow of universal woe."

454
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:32,457
"As she went, she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die"

455
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,085
"without trying to give his stifled life"

456
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:40,381
"the breath of air she had given"

457
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:42,508
"to so many others."

458
00:40:58,768 --> 00:40:59,811
"Wait!"

459
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:06,651
"Wait!"

460
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:10,572
"Wait..."

461
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:12,991
"Wait, wait!"

462
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:04,959
"Pages full of dud ID photos
torn up and discarded by their owners,"

463
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:08,671
"carefully reassembled by some oddball."

464
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:11,799
"What a family album!"

465
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:17,555
A pack of «Gauloises».

466
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:21,684
Just a second. It's so smoky in here.
Can you tell me where they are?

467
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:24,395
- I can't see a thing.
- More to the left.

468
00:42:24,437 --> 00:42:26,105
- There?
- A bit more. There.

469
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:31,277
Thank you. You need change.

470
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,737
Forget it.

471
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:35,781
- Yes?
- A «mauresque».

472
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:38,325
A «mauresque» for the young man.

473
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:41,787
One «Kir aligoté», one mauresque,
and two mint sodas.

474
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:45,124
Was that prenuptial or
post-coital smooching?

475
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:47,251
Is your bullshit congenital?

476
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:51,338
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry.

477
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,465
You'll find Mr. Right one day.

478
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:57,886
All women want to sleep
on a man's shoulder. All of them.

479
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:02,766
All men snore after a few drinks,
and I have a musical ear.

480
00:43:02,808 --> 00:43:06,562
I had an operation on my nasal cavities.

481
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:08,689
I see you're a born romantic.

482
00:43:10,482 --> 00:43:13,235
I see you've never known true love.

483
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:17,155
I did. It shortened my leg.

484
00:43:18,657 --> 00:43:23,161
- I thought you fell off a horse.
- I did.

485
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:25,706
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

486
00:43:25,747 --> 00:43:29,042
I should have known.
They always drop you at the last minute.

487
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,795
He dropped me just before my act.

488
00:43:33,922 --> 00:43:37,509
It floored me. And the horse.

489
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:40,595
With me under it.

490
00:43:42,514 --> 00:43:44,891
The «mauresque»?

491
00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:47,853
Still, true love does exist.

492
00:43:47,936 --> 00:43:51,857
I'm not saying it doesn't.
After 30 years behind this bar,

493
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,569
I'm an expert.
I can even give you the recipe.

494
00:43:57,946 --> 00:44:00,657
Take two regulars.

495
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:03,994
Let each think the other fancies them.
Leave it to simmer.

496
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:05,954
It never fails.

497
00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:16,089
Excuse me!

498
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:17,882
Excuse me.

499
00:44:17,966 --> 00:44:19,717
- I've had enough.
- I'll go.

500
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:25,473
Haven't you hurt enough people?

501
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,937
Gina can defend herself.

502
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:34,232
I don't mean Gina. I mean Georgette.

503
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:38,486
Georgette?

504
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:41,614
Open your eyes! She craves your attention

505
00:44:41,656 --> 00:44:43,449
but you only have eyes for Gina.

506
00:44:45,702 --> 00:44:49,038
Poor girl! The things she does

507
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,165
to catch your eye!

508
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:55,795
You really must be blind.

509
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,556
I'm off on a date. Bye!

510
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:08,683
Goodbye.

511
00:45:11,018 --> 00:45:13,354
Whoever her new one is,

512
00:45:13,437 --> 00:45:16,983
he can't be worse
than that nut with his tape recorder.

513
00:45:18,192 --> 00:45:20,111
Joseph's not so nutty.

514
00:45:21,195 --> 00:45:22,905
He's just in pain.

515
00:45:22,947 --> 00:45:25,950
Come off it, Amélie.
They split up two months ago.

516
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:29,286
To keep on coming here every day,
he must be a masochist.

517
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,373
Don't say you haven't noticed.

518
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,292
Noticed what?

519
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:38,212
He always sits here, right?

520
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:39,797
Yes.

521
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,215
Sit down.

522
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:43,509
Sit down, Georgette.

523
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:48,931
- What can you see?
- My cigarette counter.

524
00:45:49,974 --> 00:45:52,184
And nothing's missing?

525
00:45:52,226 --> 00:45:53,269
No.

526
00:45:54,395 --> 00:45:55,854
Make an effort.

527
00:46:02,903 --> 00:46:04,738
I don't get it!

528
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,409
I'll leave you to think about it.
Good night.

529
00:46:25,175 --> 00:46:28,011
Good morning.

«Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.»

531

«A mailbag found by climbers on a glacier
on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo»

532
00:46:38,355 --> 00:46:41,900
«lost in a plane crash in the late 1960s.»

533
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:46,446
So sad! A young, pretty princess for once.

534
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,907
Would it be less sad
if she were old and ugly?

535
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:51,159
Of course. Look at Mother Teresa.

536
00:46:53,036 --> 00:46:55,580
Is he still chasing Gina?

537
00:46:55,622 --> 00:46:57,874
No, he's after somebody else now.

538
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:02,295
- Anyone I know?
- Yes.

539
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:04,756
Funny about this glacier.

540
00:47:04,798 --> 00:47:07,676
Somebody at The Two Windmills?

541
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:09,844
Not you, surely!

542
00:47:09,886 --> 00:47:11,096
No.

543
00:47:12,305 --> 00:47:15,100
Not Suzanne.

544
00:47:15,141 --> 00:47:17,102
Surely not!

545
00:47:17,143 --> 00:47:18,853
Yes.

546
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:26,069
- Look. There he is again.
- How strange.

547
00:47:26,152 --> 00:47:29,489
- And here.
- Him again.

Always the same blank expression.

00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,293
Twelve times.

553
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:45,296
I counted.

554
00:47:45,338 --> 00:47:46,673
It's very odd.

555
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:51,678
Why keep taking your picture all over town
only to throw them away?

556
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:54,555
Good ones, too.

557
00:47:54,597 --> 00:47:57,475
It's like a sort of ritual.

558
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:59,727
Maybe he's so terrified

559
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:03,147
of growing old, it's his only consolation.

560
00:48:05,024 --> 00:48:06,275
He's dead.

561
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:08,569
Dead?

562
00:48:08,611 --> 00:48:11,447
Yes. He's scared of being forgotten.

563
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:15,701
So he uses the photo booths
to remind people what he looks like.

564
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:20,164
Like faxing his portrait
from the afterlife.

565
00:48:20,206 --> 00:48:24,210
A dead man who's scared
of being forgotten.

566
00:48:24,293 --> 00:48:27,463
At least these guys here have made it.

567
00:48:27,546 --> 00:48:29,632
They're long dead,

568
00:48:29,715 --> 00:48:33,594
but they'll never be forgotten.

569
00:48:35,971 --> 00:48:38,391
- The girl with the glass...
- Yes.

570
00:48:38,474 --> 00:48:41,811
Maybe she's distracted
because she's thinking about someone.

571
00:48:41,894 --> 00:48:43,771
Somebody in the picture?

572
00:48:45,397 --> 00:48:46,440
No.

573
00:48:46,482 --> 00:48:49,193
More likely a boy she saw somewhere,

574
00:48:49,235 --> 00:48:52,655
and felt an affinity with.

575
00:48:52,738 --> 00:48:58,869
You mean, she'd rather imagine herself
relating to someone who's absent

576
00:48:58,911 --> 00:49:03,624
than build relationships
with those around her?

577
00:49:05,918 --> 00:49:07,211
No.

578
00:49:07,252 --> 00:49:11,423
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.

579
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:13,425
What about her?

580
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:16,428
And her own messy life?

581
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,015
Who'll fix that?

582
00:49:21,683 --> 00:49:25,229
It's better to help people
than a garden gnome.

True, Mrs. Cauchoix!

593
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:08,623
It's not his fault he can't sleep.
It's Lady Di's.

Guess what I found in the truck.
A lingerie catalogue.

595
00:51:14,796 --> 00:51:19,258
He'd pasted Lady Di's face over
the model's.

No, it's about a guy who keeps a journal.

00:55:51,293 --> 00:55:53,962
- You've already asked me that.
- Yes. Yes.

637
00:55:56,632 --> 00:55:58,091
You're keeping well?

638
00:55:59,134 --> 00:56:00,594
Pretty much.

639
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:03,805
I feel a change.

640
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:10,812
I had two heart attacks
and had to have an abortion

641
00:56:10,896 --> 00:56:13,315
because I did crack while I was pregnant.

642
00:56:14,399 --> 00:56:15,984
Other than that, I'm fine.

643
00:56:16,068 --> 00:56:17,652
Good.

644
00:56:17,736 --> 00:56:19,780
Good.

645
00:56:21,573 --> 00:56:23,450
Is something wrong?

646
00:56:26,495 --> 00:56:27,579
No, nothing.

647
00:56:29,164 --> 00:56:31,041
Your garden gnome's gone.

648
00:56:32,584 --> 00:56:34,836
Is he back in the tool shed?

649
00:56:47,766 --> 00:56:48,767
Moscow.

650
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,894
There.

651
00:56:52,437 --> 00:56:54,272
No explanation.

652
00:56:54,356 --> 00:56:57,567
Maybe he just wanted to see the world.

653
00:57:00,862 --> 00:57:02,363
I can't understand it.

654
00:57:03,448 --> 00:57:05,492
I can't understand it.

655
00:57:21,215 --> 00:57:23,292
[LOST... RED AND BLACK BAG... PHOTOS ALBUM]

656
00:57:27,472 --> 00:57:30,725
"Any normal girl
would call the number straightaway,"

657
00:57:30,808 --> 00:57:32,935
"meet him at a café to return the album."

658
00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:36,272
"Then she would know
if her dream was viable."

659
00:57:36,314 --> 00:57:41,778
"It's called a reality check,
but it's the last thing Amélie wants."

660
00:57:46,407 --> 00:57:47,617
I say!

661
00:57:47,658 --> 00:57:50,161
She's not falling in love, is she?

662
00:59:16,747 --> 00:59:19,625
- ...and 30 make 50.
- Thanks, Lucien.

663
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:21,293
Yes, ladies?

664
00:59:21,335 --> 00:59:23,837
- A pound of leeks.
- Two artichokes.

665
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,756
OK.

666
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,011
- Where's the boss?
- Shh! He's sleeping in the cauliflowers.

667
00:59:31,094 --> 00:59:32,179
What?

668
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:35,182
He's sleeping in the cauliflowers.

669
00:59:35,265 --> 00:59:36,641
Oh, right.

670
00:59:42,355 --> 00:59:43,815
You want me... want what?

671
00:59:43,857 --> 00:59:46,318
A scratch card, please.

672
00:59:55,201 --> 00:59:56,911
How does it work?

673
00:59:58,872 --> 01:00:00,623
Tell you what.

674
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:04,252
I'll take one too,
and we'll do this together.

675
01:00:06,546 --> 01:00:08,590
You scratch it here...

676
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:11,885
...sideways.

677
01:00:21,978 --> 01:00:23,104
Nothing. You?

678
01:00:23,146 --> 01:00:24,939
No, me neither.

679
01:00:28,735 --> 01:00:31,070
Unlucky at cards...

680
01:00:32,405 --> 01:00:34,240
So they say!

681
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:38,995
I have to get back.

682
01:00:39,078 --> 01:00:41,664
OK. See you.

01:00:49,338 --> 01:00:50,965
"Porno Video Palace."

684
01:00:52,008 --> 01:00:54,218
I'm calling about the ad.

685
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,470
"- Are you over 18?"
- Yes.

686
01:00:56,512 --> 01:00:59,849
"- Shaved?"
- Sorry?

687
01:00:59,932 --> 01:01:03,811
"Are you shaved? Fur pie doesn't sell."

688
01:01:23,122 --> 01:01:24,331
How's life, Mrs. Walace?

689
01:01:24,373 --> 01:01:27,209
When you've nothing to live for...

690
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:31,839
- Don't say that. Life's great!
- Sure. Dream on, kid!

691
01:01:47,229 --> 01:01:48,272
Hello, Mr. Dufayel.

692
01:01:48,314 --> 01:01:50,024
Hello, Lucien.

693
01:01:50,065 --> 01:01:53,902
Here's your order, Mr. Dufayel.

694
01:01:53,986 --> 01:01:56,947
I doubt it. I hate artichokes.

695
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:59,032
You shouldn't.

696
01:01:59,074 --> 01:02:01,160
Watch this.

697
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:09,209
Take it.

698
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:13,130
That's better.

699
01:02:26,268 --> 01:02:28,228
Lucien, you're a wizard!

700
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,856
All courtesy of Mr. Collignon.

701
01:02:33,692 --> 01:02:36,695
«Mr. Collignon?» Lucien...

702
01:02:36,778 --> 01:02:39,531
Sorry, Mr. Dufayel. It just slipped out.

703
01:02:39,614 --> 01:02:41,741
Practice, Lucien!

704
01:02:41,783 --> 01:02:43,535
Practice!

705
01:02:43,618 --> 01:02:45,453
Repeat after me.

706
01:02:45,537 --> 01:02:47,664
Collignon, down the john.

707
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:52,460
- Col... Collignon, down the john.
- That's it.

708
01:02:52,544 --> 01:02:55,213
Your turn now. Go on. Collignon...

709
01:02:58,633 --> 01:03:00,802
Collignon, big moron!

710
01:03:00,885 --> 01:03:03,555
See? You can do it when you want to!

711
01:03:03,638 --> 01:03:06,224
Collignon, dead and gone!

712
01:03:06,307 --> 01:03:08,476
Very good!

713
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,561
Collignon...

714
01:03:09,644 --> 01:03:13,732
- Collignon, big moron, down the john!
- That's it!

715
01:03:21,322 --> 01:03:23,741
OK! That's enough for today.

716
01:03:23,825 --> 01:03:25,785
Enough! Enough!

717
01:03:25,827 --> 01:03:28,788
Lucien, stop!

718
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,582
Very good.

719
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:35,628
Mr. Dufayel, I found this under your mat.

720
01:04:52,663 --> 01:04:54,707
Still no win!

721
01:04:54,748 --> 01:04:56,834
Me neither.

722
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,921
May I?

723
01:05:02,256 --> 01:05:04,341
There's a little...

724
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,431
You're gorgeous

725
01:05:11,515 --> 01:05:13,183
when you blush.

726
01:05:14,268 --> 01:05:16,603
Like a wild flower.

727
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:19,982
It's my dyspepsia.

728
01:05:21,692 --> 01:05:22,693
"Morning, all."

729
01:05:24,278 --> 01:05:25,445
"Beautiful day."

730
01:05:44,548 --> 01:05:46,258
Pack of «Gitanes», please.

731
01:05:46,299 --> 01:05:50,220
«Bravo! Vive la France!» You scalded me.

732
01:05:50,303 --> 01:05:54,683
Bravo! Ten out of ten! Bull's-eye!

733
01:05:58,728 --> 01:06:00,855
It was Amélie. She...

734
01:06:34,847 --> 01:06:38,851
Do you know what happened
when they went up Mont Blanc?

735
01:06:38,935 --> 01:06:41,354
The silicon in her face froze up.

736
01:06:41,437 --> 01:06:45,900
Her face was a festering mass!

737
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:15,554
Mulled wine and ginger biscuits.

738
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:18,266
Thank you.

739
01:07:18,307 --> 01:07:21,519
I was too hard the other day
on the girl with the glass.

740
01:07:22,561 --> 01:07:26,524
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

741
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:29,110
No.

742
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:31,987
They're into different things.

743
01:07:33,072 --> 01:07:35,616
Luck is like the Tour de France.

744
01:07:35,658 --> 01:07:37,743
You wait, and it flashes past you.

745
01:07:39,328 --> 01:07:43,290
You have to catch it while you can.

746
01:08:07,689 --> 01:08:09,441
Can I help you?

747
01:08:09,525 --> 01:08:12,653
Excuse me.
I found this album in the street and I...

748
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:17,282
Nino will be so pleased!
He was so sad the other day.

749
01:08:17,366 --> 01:08:19,284
I almost prayed to St Anthony.

750
01:08:20,869 --> 01:08:23,038
Is... Nino there?

751
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:25,874
No. On Wednesdays he works at the funfair.

752
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,295
How long has he had this collection?

753
01:08:30,379 --> 01:08:34,800
Since I got him the job here, last year.

754
01:08:34,883 --> 01:08:39,054
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

755
01:08:39,137 --> 01:08:45,060
In the daytime he took pictures
of footprints in wet cement.

756
01:08:45,143 --> 01:08:47,270
He's a funny guy.

757
01:08:47,312 --> 01:08:49,606
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

758
01:08:52,818 --> 01:08:54,528
Other things like...

759
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:58,448
Whenever he heard a funny laugh,
he'd tape it.

760
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:03,662
Really?

761
01:09:05,497 --> 01:09:08,124
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

762
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:10,502
He never keeps them long.

763
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:13,338
Times are hard for dreamers.

764
01:09:13,421 --> 01:09:16,174
Eva! Where are those coffees?

765
01:09:16,257 --> 01:09:18,677
I'd better go. Thanks for the album.

766
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,389
It's OK. I've got time to take it
to the funfair.

767
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:26,893
Suit yourself. The ghost train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix, like the street.

768
01:09:51,209 --> 01:09:53,294
I'm looking for Nino. Is he here?

769
01:09:53,378 --> 01:09:55,421
He doesn't get off till seven.

770
01:09:56,964 --> 01:09:59,384
- Is there no way to see him before?
- Sure.

771
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:02,303
20 francs.

772
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:14,875
See you next Wednesday.

773
01:11:26,595 --> 01:11:31,016
"5pm tomorrow, Montmartre carousel
near the phone box. Bring a 5 franc piece."

774
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:51,244
"Want to know about her?"

775
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:56,708
- You know her? You saw her?
"- You bet."

776
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,752
"She put us in her shirt pocket."

777
01:11:59,795 --> 01:12:01,379
"Next to her breast."

778
01:12:01,421 --> 01:12:03,340
Is she pretty?

779
01:12:03,423 --> 01:12:05,342
"Not bad."

780
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:08,428
"- Beautiful.
- No, pretty."

781
01:12:08,511 --> 01:12:09,804
"- Beautiful.
- Pretty."

782
01:12:09,846 --> 01:12:13,683
- What does she want from you?
"- She's broke."

783
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:16,436
"She wants a reward for the album."

784
01:12:16,478 --> 01:12:18,772
"Or she collects photos, too."

785
01:12:18,855 --> 01:12:23,109
"She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!"

786
01:12:27,781 --> 01:12:28,823
No, you dope!

787
01:12:30,366 --> 01:12:32,744
She's in love.

788
01:12:32,786 --> 01:12:35,538
- I don't even know her.
"- Yes, you do."

789
01:12:35,622 --> 01:12:37,415
Since when?

790
01:12:37,499 --> 01:12:39,209
"You've always known her."

791
01:12:39,292 --> 01:12:40,543
"In your dreams."

792
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:55,058
Hello?

793
01:12:55,099 --> 01:12:59,187
Yes. You! Man with the plastic bag!
It's for you.

794
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:02,190
- Me?
- Yes.

795
01:13:05,526 --> 01:13:06,569
Thank you.

796
01:13:08,571 --> 01:13:09,572
Hello?

797
01:13:09,614 --> 01:13:12,366
Follow the blue arrows, Mr. Quincampoix.

798
01:14:37,659 --> 01:14:42,122
When the finger's pointing to the sky,
only a fool looks at the finger.

799
01:15:54,694 --> 01:15:55,695
Hello?

"dip his finger in the sugar,"

958
01:37:32,772 --> 01:37:35,441
"turn around slowly,"

959
01:37:35,525 --> 01:37:37,568
"and speak to me."

960
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,159
Excuse me.

961
01:37:46,703 --> 01:37:47,912
Is this you?

962
01:37:54,377 --> 01:37:55,628
Yes, it's you.

963
01:38:16,315 --> 01:38:18,401
I'll take that.

964
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:22,488
Another coffee?

965
01:38:22,571 --> 01:38:24,657
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- OK.

966
01:38:45,261 --> 01:38:49,682
So it's this man here,
the one with his hand up?

967
01:38:50,933 --> 01:38:51,976
Yes.

968
01:38:54,353 --> 01:38:57,189
Is she in love with him?

969
01:39:00,025 --> 01:39:01,026
Yes.

970
01:39:02,945 --> 01:39:06,323
I think it's time she took a real risk.

971
01:39:06,365 --> 01:39:10,869
She might just do that.
She's devising a stratagem.

972
01:39:10,953 --> 01:39:14,581
She's fond of stratagems.

973
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:17,668
Yes.

974
01:39:19,378 --> 01:39:21,505
In fact, she's cowardly.

975
01:39:22,881 --> 01:39:26,260
That's why I can't capture her look.

976
01:39:28,136 --> 01:39:33,600
"Dufayel's attempts to meddle
are intolerable!"

977
01:39:36,144 --> 01:39:42,067
"If Amélie chooses to live in a dream"

978
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:46,321
"and remain an introverted young woman,"

979
01:39:46,405 --> 01:39:51,034
"she has an absolute right
to mess up her life!"

980
01:40:25,777 --> 01:40:27,529
What are you doing, Mr. Dufayel?

981
01:40:29,948 --> 01:40:32,033
Tell me, Lucien.

982
01:40:32,116 --> 01:40:36,955
For deliveries,
do you keep keys to all the apartments?

983
01:40:49,467 --> 01:40:53,304
One of your booths is out of order.

984
01:40:55,473 --> 01:40:57,975
It seems to be jammed.

985
01:40:59,143 --> 01:41:01,395
Gare de l'Est ticket hall.

986
01:41:04,232 --> 01:41:06,609
- Buy a video, get one free.
- No, thanks.

987
01:41:13,407 --> 01:41:15,034
Sam?

988
01:41:16,077 --> 01:41:17,119
Samantha?

989
01:41:20,498 --> 01:41:21,499
Samantha?

990
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:28,339
Can you stand in for me at...

991
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,000
"Can you replace me this afternoon?"

992
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:55,180
"Photo booth, Gare de l'Est ticket hall,
Tuesday 5pm."

993
01:43:09,105 --> 01:43:10,398
Almost done.

994
01:43:15,528 --> 01:43:19,574
"The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of aging,"

995
01:43:19,616 --> 01:43:21,701

996
01:43:21,785 --> 01:43:24,204
"a normal guy doing his job."

997
01:43:26,373 --> 01:43:27,999
Sorry.

998
01:44:13,669 --> 01:44:17,006
He keeps spying on me!
It's making me sick.

999
01:44:17,089 --> 01:44:20,468
4:05: Blatant female conspiracy.

1000
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:24,972
Gosh, you're tense, Georgette!

1001
01:44:26,015 --> 01:44:27,558
Good luck. You'll need it.

1002
01:44:33,022 --> 01:44:37,568
Excuse me. Did you put this in my pocket?

1003
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:41,030
- Yes, but I'm not the one...
- I know. Where is she?

1004
01:44:41,113 --> 01:44:42,615
She's at her father's.

1005
01:44:42,698 --> 01:44:46,162
It's awkward. I'd like to speak to you,
but...

1006
01:44:46,196 --> 01:44:48,078
I finish work at six.

1007
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,080
- Can you come back?
- OK.

1008
01:44:51,123 --> 01:44:52,208
See you later.

1009
01:44:52,291 --> 01:44:55,836
4:08: Docking scheduled.

1010
01:45:27,659 --> 01:45:32,331
The blond guy in a camel coat.
He's very absent-minded, too.

1011
01:45:32,414 --> 01:45:34,124
How come?

1012
01:45:35,167 --> 01:45:37,628
He came back three times
the same afternoon.

1013
01:45:38,921 --> 01:45:40,172
1:12:

1014
01:45:40,255 --> 01:45:41,506
"Camel coat."

1015
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:42,799
2:50:

1016
01:45:42,841 --> 01:45:44,676
"Camel coat."

1017
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,928
"- 4:17: Camel coat.
- Stop it!"

1018
01:45:48,013 --> 01:45:51,183
My rash has come back! Look, Suzanne!

1019
01:45:51,266 --> 01:45:54,936
My rash is back. He's driving me nuts.

1020
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,147
Lay off!

1021
01:45:57,189 --> 01:46:01,485
If she had a clear conscience,
she wouldn't be in such a state.

1022
01:46:01,526 --> 01:46:03,487
I've had it. I'm going home.

1023
01:46:03,528 --> 01:46:07,032
Psychos are the last straw!

1024
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:10,452
Georgette! Georg...

1025
01:46:12,037 --> 01:46:14,789
Stop smothering them!
Women need to breathe.

1026
01:46:14,873 --> 01:46:18,126
You let them breathe,
they want a change of air.

1027
01:46:18,209 --> 01:46:20,045
Fresh air's healthy.

1028
01:46:20,128 --> 01:46:22,088
Shut it, failure!

1029
01:46:24,632 --> 01:46:26,343
Failed writer, failed life...

1030
01:46:26,384 --> 01:46:28,970
I love the word «fail».

1031
01:46:29,054 --> 01:46:31,056
Failure is human destiny.

1032
01:46:31,139 --> 01:46:32,682
It's gasbag time!

1033
01:46:32,724 --> 01:46:35,977
Failure teaches us
that life is but a draft,

1034
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:39,898
a long rehearsal for a show
that will never play.

1035
01:46:41,316 --> 01:46:43,651
I bet he stole that.

1036
01:46:43,735 --> 01:46:46,196
I do have some original ideas,

1037
01:46:46,237 --> 01:46:51,701
but people always steal them.
A bit like your women.

1038
01:46:51,743 --> 01:46:53,786
Meaning?

1039
01:46:53,828 --> 01:46:57,040
Meaning you'd better get used to it.

1040
01:46:57,081 --> 01:46:59,626
Speak for yourself, you...

1041
01:46:59,667 --> 01:47:00,710
What?

1042
01:47:04,505 --> 01:47:07,592
- What's going on?
- Nothing much. Georgette went out.

1043
01:47:07,675 --> 01:47:09,385
Joseph got mad.

1044
01:47:09,427 --> 01:47:10,928
«Went out?»

1045
01:47:11,012 --> 01:47:16,184
Just like Gina. You know who's she's with?
The guy with the plastic bag.

1046
01:47:17,935 --> 01:47:20,271
I saw their little game.

1047
01:47:20,354 --> 01:47:22,648
The note in the coat pocket,

1048
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:24,317
4:08.

1049
01:47:24,358 --> 01:47:28,321
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

1050
01:47:32,283 --> 01:47:34,683
I'm worried for Amélie because I like you.

1051
01:47:34,717 --> 01:47:35,944
What do you mean?

1052
01:47:36,954 --> 01:47:40,750
By and large, the men I like
are mentally unsound.

1053
01:47:40,791 --> 01:47:43,836
- I'd like to know more about you.
- Ask me questions.

1054
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:48,424
One swallow doesn't make...?

1055
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:50,551
A swallow?

1056
01:47:52,136 --> 01:47:53,679
A spring.

1057
01:47:53,721 --> 01:47:55,097
And clothes...?

1058
01:47:55,139 --> 01:47:56,682
The monk.

1059
01:47:56,724 --> 01:47:58,142
- A good cat deserves...?
- A rat.

1060
01:47:58,225 --> 01:47:59,852
- Patience...?
- Is a virtue.

1061
01:47:59,894 --> 01:48:01,478
- Rolling stone...?
- Gathers no moss.

1062
01:48:01,562 --> 01:48:03,856
- It's a sin...?
- To steal a pin.

1063
01:48:03,898 --> 01:48:05,900
Absence makes...?

1064
01:48:05,983 --> 01:48:07,401
The heart grow fonder.

1065
01:48:07,484 --> 01:48:09,445
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

1066
01:48:09,486 --> 01:48:13,824
In my family, we say a man
who knows his proverbs can't be all bad.

1067
01:48:18,412 --> 01:48:21,874
Pretty girl from the 5th floor,
listen to this!

1068
01:48:21,915 --> 01:48:24,877
- Do you believe in miracles?
- Not today.

1069
01:48:26,336 --> 01:48:28,464
You're in for a surprise.

1070
01:48:28,505 --> 01:48:31,842
What if I told you that a team of climbers

1071
01:48:31,925 --> 01:48:35,846
on Mont Blanc had found

1072

"hard proof that my husband loved me?"

1073

She's baking her famous plum cake?
