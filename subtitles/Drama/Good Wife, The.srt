1
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:08,571
I want to be clear.

2
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:10,540
I have never abused my office.

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,775
<i>Alicia,</i>

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:14,010
I know this has been
hard on you,

5
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,612
But you have to believe me--
I'm innocent.

6
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:17,347
<i>Jackie:
He needs you</i>

7
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:19,015
To forgive him, alicia.

8
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:21,318
Jackie, he took everything
I thought we had

9
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:24,054
And he just put it
out there for everyone.

10
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:26,022
He didn't want that.
The press...

11
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:27,857
Oh, jackie,
stop it.

12
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:30,460
Peter wasn't thinking of us.

13
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:34,130
Kalinda sharma.

14
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:36,666
I'm the in-house.
Oh, the investigator.

15
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,635
You're peter florrick's wife.
That's right.

16
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,503
Ryan thinks there's
a good chance

17
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:42,605
The appellate court's going
to listen to my case.

18
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:45,008
If they overturn it,
everything goes back to normal.

19
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,411
Peter, it's never
going back to normal.

20
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:57,620
<i>Golden:
This was after you dropped
your kids off at school?</i>

21
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:00,090
<i>Alicia:
Yes.</i>

22
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,427
Golden: This was
on the 16th?

23
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:06,629
Yes.

24
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:10,400
And who first told you of
your husband's infidelity,

25
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:13,236
Mrs. Florrick?

26
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:15,004
Cnbc.

27
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,539
(laughs)

28
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,208
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

29
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:21,878
I was at the cleaners.

30
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,646
I was waiting in line.

31
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:26,249
Cnbc was playing on the tv.

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,253
I saw it on the crawl
at the bottom of the screen.

33
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:32,288
And, just so we're clear,

34
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:34,958
You never once suspected
your husband's infidelity

35
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,026
Before that moment, is that
correct, mrs. Florrick?

36
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:39,996
That's correct.

37
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:42,766
I'm-I'm sorry to ask these
personal questions,

38
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,267
But I'm really
on your side,

39
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:46,403
And as your
husband's attorney,

40
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:48,638
Our appeal depends on proving
that your husband made

41
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:49,839
Untruthful
statements at work,

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,775
Not because he was
trying to cover up

43
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:54,244
Illegal acts as a
state's attorney,

44
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:57,680
But that he was trying
to hide an affair

45
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:00,183
From his wife.

46
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:01,851
You understand?

47
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,987
I understand.

48
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:05,655
Good.

49
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:07,223
Uh...

50
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:09,592
Let's turn to
the call girl.

51
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:10,860
She made some statements
in the press.

52
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,662
(phone rings)

53
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:16,433
Alicia florrick.

54
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:18,968
When?

55
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,372
Are you sure
you need me now?

56
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,211
Um... I'll call your office
to arrange

57
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:30,513
To do this
another time?

58
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:34,751
I just want to let you know
that peter has a lot of friends.

59
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:37,053
Judges, lawyers,
business folk

60
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:39,689
Who didn't like the way
that this went down.

61
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,723
They want to help.

62
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:43,860
I'm just saying
if you need anything,

63
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:46,162
Day or night,

64
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:49,199
Give me a call?

65
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:53,503
We're fine.

66
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:55,171
Ah, one more thing.

67
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,873
Um...

68
00:02:56,874 --> 00:02:57,941
We're looking
for correspondence

69
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,275
That may have taken place

70
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:01,978
Between peter
and a gerald kozko.

71
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:06,182
Just like the store,
only with a "k" and a "z."

72
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:07,584
The real estate
developer.

73
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:09,953
Peter says all
of his private correspondences

74
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:11,888
Are at your apartment.

75
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,656
It would help a lot

76
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:17,727
If you could look for a letter
or a card from him.

77
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:18,828
That's it.

78
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:23,533
Dentist visit... Is over.

79
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,246
Alicia.

80
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:38,348
I heard you were coming
on board to replace bree.

81
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:39,516
Could you...?
Sure.

82
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,184
Ah, talk about
complicated.

83
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:42,519
Jury selection
took a week.

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,820
We got five more of these

85
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,622
Filled with medical testimony
and the depo dump.

86
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:46,856
Did you read that?

87
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:48,892
I was on will's felony case
till 30 minutes ago.

88
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:50,193
Yeah, I was on
a slip-and-fall

89
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,394
Until diane yanked
me on this.

90
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:53,096
It's just "all hands
on deck," you know?

91
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:54,397
But this one's
pretty cool,

92
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:57,400
So come on, I'll get
you up to speed.

93
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:00,570
Diane:
And what is an
ironman, ray?

94
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:03,706
Ray:
Running, biking,
ocean swimming.

95
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:06,142
You swim 2.4 miles,

96
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:08,211
Bike 112 miles,

97
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:09,712
And then run a
full marathon.

98
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:11,681
And you placed third
in the hawaiian ironman,

99
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,349
Is that correct?

100
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,518
Ray:
Yes, I did, yeah.

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,554
Diane:
So tell me what
happened on the 12th,

102
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:18,655
Ray.

103
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:19,923
Ray:
Well, it was right after

104
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:21,424
The ironman.

105
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:23,927
We were back
at the hotel,

106
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:25,261
And I felt
this migraine coming on,

107
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:27,530
So I took these...

108
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,999
Pills my doctor
prescribed me

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,535
And the migraine
just...

110
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:34,537
...Seemed to be getting worse.

111
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:36,272
Ray demory.

112
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:37,740
He's our test case.

113
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,075
If diane wins
this one,

114
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:41,044
There's a massive class
action in the wings.

115
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:43,313
Ray:
...I felt unsteady.

116
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,882
The next day at the hospital,
I found out I had a stroke.

117
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:48,318
And these pills you took--
they were zennapril, correct?

118
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,652
Your honor...

119
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:52,956
The drug manufactured by these
three gentlemen over here.

120
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:54,724
There's nothing I enjoy
more than watching

121
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,159
Miss lockhart perform

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,327
Her courtroom magic...

123
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:59,996
James mccloon-- killer
defense counsel.

124
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:01,331
They call him
the velvet shiv.

125
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,132
Mccloon:
...My clients
manufactured

126
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,233
Zennapril,

127
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:05,702
And stop poking
at them like perps

128
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:07,070
<i>On america's most wanted.
Funny,</i>

129
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:08,304
I didn't hear an objection,
your honor.

130
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:10,873
Let's just please refrain
from the crosstalk.

131
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,041
Yes, your honor.

132
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:14,243
I will try not to interrupt
miss lockhart again.

133
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:15,478
It will be difficult,

134
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:16,846
But I will try.

135
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:19,182
So, ray,

136
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:21,818
How would you describe
your physical condition now?

137
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:22,952
(chuckles)

138
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:25,855
You're looking at it.

139
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,692
Mostly it's been
hard on carol.

140
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:35,298
We got married a year ago,
before my stroke, and she...

141
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:37,834
She didn't buy
into this.

142
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:39,569
I mean...

143
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,439
One day her husband's an ironman
and the next day he's a...

144
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,807
(sighs)

145
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:47,010
...An invalid.

146
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:50,947
Brandon, lahna, you take point
on legal precedent.

147
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:52,382
Cary, you take alicia
and review anything

148
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:53,616
That could undercut
the class action.

149
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:56,252
I don't want
to win the battle
and lose the war.

150
00:05:56,253 --> 00:05:57,620
Use kalinda
if you need to, okay?

151
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:59,889
Let's get to it.

152
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,669
Mrs. Demory.

153
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,569
Hmm?

154
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,104
Can I get you
something?

155
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:18,141
No, I'm fine.

156
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:21,177
Sorry, must have had
a zombie look on my face.

157
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:22,278
No, no, no.

158
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,281
We all need a moment.

159
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:27,483
I'm alicia.

160
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:30,853
Right, you replaced bree.

161
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:33,523
Nice to meet you.

162
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,025
Oh, this.

163
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:38,194
This is what keeps us going.

164
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:41,397
Michael graff.

165
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:44,701
He took zennapril
after a little league game.

166
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:47,103
Jenny hollis.

167
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:50,006
She was a dancer.

168
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:52,075
They all wrote you?

169
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:53,242
Yes.

170
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:56,012
138 of them.

171
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:57,980
I...

172
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:59,382
Sorry.

173
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:02,318
Just...

174
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,454
They're all counting
on us, you know?

175
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:08,357
If we don't win,
they're stuck.

176
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:12,028
It's just a lot
of responsibility, you know?

177
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,400
Objection.
Relevance.
Isn't it the case,

178
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,235
Mr. Demory, the only reason
you're not suing your doctor is

179
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:22,138
Because his pockets aren't
as deep as my client's?

180
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,206
Objection!
Your honor!

181
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:24,340
Can we have a ruling?
Please, your honor.

182
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:27,076
Approach the bench.
Get me all references

183
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:29,245
To secondary prescriptions
in ray's deposition.

184
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:30,780
Right.

185
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:24,700
<i>Alicia:
Kalinda, I need you
to look into this.</i>

186
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,769
So, what are you saying?
Someone's bribing a juror?

187
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,804
I'm not saying
anything.

188
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:30,239
I just found it.

189
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,141
Look, this could
be anything.

190
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:34,777
A seating chart
for a garden party,

191
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:35,812
A football lineup.

192
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:38,247
With 12 linemen?

193
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:44,120
What's that?

194
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,890
Alicia:
Yep.

195
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:22,425
We should talk
to the hostess,

196
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,227
See if anyone from the court
eats here regularly.

197
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:26,596
No, we should take a deep
breath, show this to diane...

198
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:27,930
Shh!

199
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,032
Man: ...Only spot in
chicago not stuffed
full of yuppies.

200
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:31,467
Been coming here
three times a week...

201
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:34,537
I don't think we need
to talk to the hostess.

202
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:35,605
I come here
so often,

203
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:37,807
I asked them to name
a sandwich after me.

204
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:39,642
Waitress looked me dead
in the eye and said,

205
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,177
"we don't serve ham."

206
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:44,313
(laughter)

207
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:50,319
(no audio)

208
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:55,925
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

209
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:09,020
It could be anything.

210
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:09,621
It could be
just a doodle.

211
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:10,889
We don't know.

212
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,958
And you found it
in our depositions?

213
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,460
Yes, but it could have been
on the floor and stuck to one.

214
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:18,597
We just thought it should be
brought to your attention.

215
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:20,198
Remember last year?
Yep.

216
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,867
Diane: Was mccloon
ever cleared of that?

217
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:23,535
Will:
It's still up for review.

218
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:24,636
So you think
we should-- what?

219
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:26,338
Don't go to
the judge.

220
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,073
It makes no sense.

221
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,341
How does it end
up in our depos?

222
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:30,475
Mccloon sticks it in there.

223
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,643
He wants a mistrial,

224
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,578
But he wants us to go
to the judge and request it.

225
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,514
Or he's just screwing
with your head.

226
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,118
There's another
possibility.

227
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,153
There's a young associate
on his team-- a redhead.

228
00:10:42,154 --> 00:10:44,122
She came over and introduced
herself this morning.

229
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:46,358
Said she worked as a paralegal
here last summer.

230
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:49,160
So, what, mccloon has
a whistle-blower in his midst?

231
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,830
Young, idealistic junior
associate sees something wrong,

232
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,366
Feels bad about it,
slips us a warning in our depos.

233
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,634
I could see that.

234
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:59,404
Okay, this is what we do.

235
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:02,340
We do our homework
and look into juror number two.

236
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:03,675
And juror number 11.

237
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:05,310
Mm-hmm.
Or juror number 11.

238
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,178
We go to the judge
if we have anything.

239
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:08,413
You don't want a mistrial,
right?

240
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:09,915
No.
Ray was good on the stand.

241
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,149
The jury liked him.

242
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,951
And mccloon's defense seems
to be a variation

243
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:15,020
On holding his breath
and threatening to turn blue.

244
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:17,756
This trial is sounding
more and more fun.

245
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:20,191
Let's see if you got
a bad juror on your hands.

246
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:21,893
Put in for an alternate.
Okay. I'll put

247
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:23,094
Kalinda and cary on it.

248
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:24,596
Excuse me...

249
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,698
But I'd like to do this.

250
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:30,468
Okay.

251
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,940
Juror number two
is marilyn wolk,

252
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,708
A hairdresser
from south bridgeport.

253
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:40,345
We scored her an 85 positive
on our bias scale,

254
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:42,047
One of the highest scores
we've ever given,

255
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:43,982
So we believe
she's firmly in your camp.

256
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:47,786
Now, I know that you pay me
only to help select jurors,

257
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:49,721
But if I knew
what you were after,

258
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,756
I could offer
further consultation.

259
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:54,259
No.

260
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,527
This is good.

261
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:57,228
Keep going.

262
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:01,600
Uh, juror number 11
is calvin tober.

263
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:04,369
He's a grad student
in comparative history.

264
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,038
We scored him only
a 62% positive

265
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,640
On our bias scale--

266
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,575
Well within the range
of acceptability,

267
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:11,710
But we like him.

268
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:14,112
Being african-american,
he's more prone

269
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:15,914
To mistrust authority.

270
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:17,916
He's intelligent, but not
to the point of overcoming bias.

271
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,752
Not like asians
or mexicans.

272
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:25,724
We talk in racial stereotypes
because you pay us to,

273
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,792
And we find
racial profiling works.

274
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,260
But if I'm
not needed...

275
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,895
You're not needed.

276
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,567
Thank you.

277
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:45,410
You've got issues?

278
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:48,647
Paying her $100,000
for three months

279
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:51,016
Of high school-level
psychology--

280
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:53,585
Yeah, I guess I do have issues.

281
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:55,487
Okay.

282
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:57,022
So, what are we thinking?

283
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,923
(sighs)

284
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,431
Wolk worked as a rent-a-chair
hair stylist, right?

285
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,033
Which means she
only gets paid

286
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:09,601
When she actually
has a customer.

287
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:11,369
She could have claimed
financial hardship

288
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,438
And ducked jury duty.

289
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:14,939
So why didn't she?

290
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,775
Civic duty?

291
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:18,843
Jury tampering pays better.

292
00:13:18,844 --> 00:13:20,278
Okay.

293
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,213
But let's look into both.

294
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,916
Okay.

295
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,085
Hi. I hate to trouble you,

296
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:28,853
But I'm from
the next building over

297
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:31,656
And the delivery man left this
at my door by mistake.

298
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:34,392
Is there a mr. Tober
in the building?

299
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:36,895
Hi.

300
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,363
I'm sorry to bother you.

301
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:41,199
My name's kalinda,
and my husband and I

302
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,268
Were thinking of buying a home
in the area.

303
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:44,536
I can always come back later,

304
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,271
If you know what time
he gets home.

305
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:47,539
We're interested
in the preschool

306
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,673
Around the corner and...

307
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:50,341
...Or anyone else in his family.

308
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:52,310
I just wanted to get a sense
of the neighborhood.

309
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,012
Tober, I think his name is.

310
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:56,281
Usually, I don't like
black people much,

311
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:57,816
But he seems nice.

312
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,351
They're the wolks.

313
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:01,686
She's a hairdresser.

314
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:04,823
And he's...  Actually,
I think he's out of work.

315
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,325
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.
Mmm.

316
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:09,327
Hard times, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.

317
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:10,962
But their house
is so lovely.

318
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,764
Looks like they put
a lot into it.

319
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,399
Storm windows
in front

320
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,600
And air-conditioning...

321
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:16,735
They bought a car, too.

322
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:19,671
Guess they came
into some money.

323
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:21,106
Hey, there he is now.

324
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:24,442
That's the
husband-- derek.

325
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:25,443
(car alarm chirps)

326
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:27,011
Oh, gosh!

327
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:28,580
I'm sorry.

328
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,915
I forgot-- I have
to meet the realtor.
Oh!

329
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,951
Thanks so much for your time.

330
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:42,560
Diane:
Objection, your honor.

331
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:43,762
Is this
really necessary?

332
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:45,663
Mccloon:
The demorys are
seeking damages

333
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:47,832
For loss of consortium,
your honor.

334
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,334
The jury needs
to understand that loss.

335
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,202
Counsel...
Diane:
Sir, the term,
"consortium,"

336
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:53,438
Is not limited...
Mccloon:
I know what the term

337
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,140
Consortium means.
Counselors, please.

338
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,342
I have prided myself
in not using my gavel once

339
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:58,977
In my 30 years on the bench...

340
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:01,546
What's going on?
...But you are truly
making me reconsider.

341
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:02,781
What?
Now, miss lockhart,

342
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:05,350
I just... Overruled.

343
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:06,918
Ka-ching.

344
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,087
Cary:
I heard you were on

345
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:10,989
Some hush-hush project.
What is it?

346
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,824
It's hush-hush.

347
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,759
Mccloon:
Mrs. Demory,

348
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,494
Before your husband's stroke,

349
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,730
How often did you
have sexual relations?

350
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,131
I don't know-- I guess...

351
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:21,733
Twice a week.

352
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:22,967
Mccloon:
And since the stroke,

353
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:25,103
How often do
you have sex?

354
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:27,705
Carol:
I don't know.

355
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:29,607
Mccloon:
Would you say
it was less?

356
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:30,608
Yes.

357
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:31,676
Less.

358
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,011
But your husband

359
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:35,814
Isn't completely paralyzed
from the waist down, is he?

360
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,020
Carol:
No.

361
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:45,490
No, I'm fine.

362
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:46,591
I'm just...

363
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:49,027
Angry at myself for
letting him get to me.

364
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:51,329
Well, it's hard when they
treat your private life

365
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,697
Like a crime scene.

366
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:53,798
Yeah.

367
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,701
But I guess there are...
Greater tragedies.

368
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:01,306
(phone ringing)

369
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,109
Alicia florrick.

370
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,211
Ah. Alicia.

371
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:07,712
I'm glad I got you.
It's daniel.

372
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:08,746
Who?

373
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:09,781
Peter's lawyer.

374
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:10,748
Oh, hi.

375
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:11,816
Do you have a minute?

376
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:12,984
Actually, I'm a bit busy.

377
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:14,018
I was just wondering if you had

378
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,286
A chance to look
for the kozko letters.

379
00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:17,889
We're struggling
with these weekend meetings

380
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,124
That he had with peter,

381
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,492
Um, last March.

382
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:24,128
Uh, the ninth, the 16th
and the 25th.

383
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:26,598
I haven't looked yet.

384
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:27,832
Anything that will show

385
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,002
That peter did not know,
going into those meetings,

386
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:33,805
There was something untoward
will help us.

387
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:38,276
Daniel:
Oh, uh...

388
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:39,944
Alicia, um...

389
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,747
I was chatting with
the headmaster at briarcrest

390
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,382
On another matter,
and he mentioned

391
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:46,517
That they have scholarships
for your kids.

392
00:16:46,518 --> 00:16:47,986
Mr. Golden.

393
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,520
Yes?

394
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:51,756
Don't. Please.

395
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,492
Yes.

396
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,394
I'm sorry.

397
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,714
(indistinct conversation)

398
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:28,860
(sighs)

399
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:42,740
Kalinda (over phone):
$35,000 can buy you
a lot of stuff.

400
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:44,409
Alicia:
That's a bit tenuous, isn't it?

401
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,778
Her husband works
at mccloon's firm?

402
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,613
Look, I'm not saying
it's a smoking gun.

403
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:51,149
I'm just saying that she
didn't put it on her voir dire,

404
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,718
So if we wanted to get rid
of her, we can.

405
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:57,689
I say we bring it to diane
and see what she says, okay?

406
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,258
Thanks. Bye.

407
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:26,317
Grace: Zach, give me
back the remote!

408
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:28,686
Zach: We've already
seen this one.

409
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:33,658
Peter (on video):
Shh. Not so loud.

410
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,960
(girl giggling)

411
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,795
Peter:
I don't hear the front door.

412
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,333
Is she gone?

413
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,968
(girl giggling)

414
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,306
Peter: Oh, I thought for sure
she suspected something.

415
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:51,809
(sighs)

416
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,278
Oh, yes!
(laughter over camera)

417
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:56,280
Zach, give me the camera.

418
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:59,617
Peter:
I'm not alone in this.
I am not alone in this.

419
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:01,519
It wasn't even my idea!

420
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,487
Let's go!

421
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:04,889
Hurry up.
Yeah.

422
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,257
Peter:
Okay.

423
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,927
Here we go.

424
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:11,462
Put a lot of
this on, right?

425
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:12,630
Do we have
sprinkles?

426
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:13,898
Peter: Hurry up.
She's coming back.

427
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:15,233
What the heck do you do?

428
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,934
I don't know; it's a
little too thick.

429
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:19,237
All right... I'm gonna do
a little surgery.

430
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:21,039
I just wanted to lay
on it a little...

431
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,006
You know what I mean?

432
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,341
Straighter.
Yeah, push it...

433
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:25,076
Peter:
I know, but it's sticking
to the bottom.

434
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:26,677
Grace: Dad, you were
supposed to get rose petals

435
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:28,246
Already petaled,
not roses.

436
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,048
I know, but this is what I have.

437
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:31,315
Zach:
Dad, that looks...
Okay.

438
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,317
How does that look?
That looks
terrible.

439
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,820
Grace:
Oh, my gosh.

440
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,021
Zach:
That looks expensive.

441
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,490
Peter: There goes your
college education.

442
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:41,692
(all laughing)

443
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,229
Okay, let's get ready.

444
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,275
The day you were talking about--
the 16th--

445
00:19:57,276 --> 00:19:59,177
The day he was supposedly
with kozko...

446
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:00,478
Well, he couldn't have been.

447
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,580
He was with us the whole day.

448
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:03,848
Okay.

449
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,017
I'll bring it by your office--
30 minutes.

450
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:07,218
Hey, jackie?

451
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:08,486
I'm heading out.

452
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:09,821
Oh, but I'm making dinner.

453
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,856
Wow.

454
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:13,024
That's big.

455
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:14,258
Mmm.

456
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:20,331
Where did this
come from?

457
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:21,699
Well, it was on
the doorstep.

458
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,068
I think it's
from your work.

459
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:29,540
It's very nice of your
firm, wasn't it?

460
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:36,747
Uh, dear, what...

461
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:38,483
Oh, dear.

462
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,087
Alicia,
what are you doing?

463
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:44,722
(sighs)

464
00:20:45,557 --> 00:20:46,824
What else was in the basket?

465
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:47,859
(stammering)

466
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,260
I don't know. Bananas.

467
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:51,062
Anything else?
I don't know.

468
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,463
Cookies?

469
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:01,906
Oh, good.
I'm so glad.

470
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,775
Uh... You have the tape?

471
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,210
Why, yes.

472
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:08,212
And something else, too.

473
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,082
A gift.

474
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:13,818
What is it?

475
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:15,853
Ham, ipods,

476
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:17,822
Some half-eaten bananas.

477
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,959
Don't you ever
try to buy me.

478
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,662
And don't you ever try
to buy my kids.

479
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:25,930
You understand that?

480
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:42,493
We're still working on the
other juror-- juror number 11.

481
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:44,128
And we're not saying
that juror number two

482
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:45,429
Was definitely
bought off.

483
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,598
We just think that
based on appearances

484
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,834
And the fact that it
just takes one bad juror

485
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:51,535
To toss out a favorable verdict,

486
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:53,604
We should use
that as pretext

487
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,607
To bump juror number two
and put in the alternate.

488
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:01,178
They make a good point.

489
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:03,814
Better to be
safe than sorry.

490
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:06,149
What does the jury consultant
say about the alternate?

491
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,485
The alternate's
a republican.

492
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:10,353
Not as good for us as
the current juror.

493
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:12,089
So what if juror number two
wasn't bought off?

494
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,224
I've just replaced a good juror
with a bad alternate.

495
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:17,027
So, smoke out mccloon.

496
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:19,463
Bring the potential bias
to the judge,

497
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,131
But don't insist on
replacing juror two.

498
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,866
Just bring it up.

499
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,568
And if mccloon goes crazy,
you know she was bought,

500
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:25,602
And fight for her expulsion.

501
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:27,738
And mccloon doesn't go nuts?

502
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:29,806
Just say you were
following your duty

503
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,108
As an officer of the court.

504
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:33,076
Back off.

505
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:36,379
It's your call.

506
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:42,152
We don't know what this means,
your honor.

507
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,820
We just know it wasn't in
juror number two's voir dire.

508
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,555
I don't even look at the guards
at my reception;

509
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:47,924
I go straight down to
the parking garage.

510
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:49,559
I don't understand,
miss lockhart--

511
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,262
Do you want juror number two
off the jury or not?

512
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:53,463
Well, we're undecided,
your honor.

513
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:54,598
We merely felt an obligation

514
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,032
To bring it
to the court's attention.

515
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:58,769
Hey, if miss lockhart has
any hesitation at all,

516
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,470
I say let's dump her.

517
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:02,005
Of course, we are willing
to stipulate

518
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,140
To the fairness of this.

519
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:04,808
Mccloon:
Let's just put in
the alternate.

520
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,376
We have no objection,
your honor.

521
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:07,644
Judge:
All right, fine.

522
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:08,745
Juror number two is out.

523
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:10,213
We'll put in
the alternate.

524
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:17,821
We got played.

525
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:18,822
What happened?

526
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,357
It was a mccloon setup.

527
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,325
He put the placemat
in our depos

528
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:24,427
To get us to dump
our best juror.

529
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:26,429
We don't know that.

530
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,098
Mccloon didn't fight it.

531
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,166
He welcomed it.

532
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,001
He wanted number two
off the jury.
Right.

533
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,035
Because we were wrong.

534
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,069
It wasn't number two.

535
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,137
It was number 11.

536
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:35,472
Or it was no one.

537
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:37,474
Okay, maybe.

538
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:39,009
But we find out.

539
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,811
I don't know.

540
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:42,245
We thought number two
looked guilty

541
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:43,847
Because she wanted
to serve on a jury.

542
00:23:43,848 --> 00:23:46,149
But she was just
being a good person.
So?

543
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,186
So, if that x was
on juror number five

544
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:50,821
Or eight or anyone,

545
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:53,089
We would pry into their lives
and we would find something,

546
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,492
Because from the outside
people look guilty.

547
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:56,660
Yeah, and sometimes,

548
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:58,028
People from the outside
look guilty

549
00:23:58,029 --> 00:23:59,429
<i>Because they are guilty.</i>

550
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,198
I mean, what's your point?
We don't look?

551
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,332
(sighs)

552
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,567
I don't know.

553
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,202
I don't like prying.

554
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:06,770
Then don't.

555
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:08,605
Let me.

556
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,807
(knocking on door)

557
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,277
Oh, thank god.

558
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:15,779
I hope you can help me.

559
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,013
I just locked myself out

560
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:19,583
Of 4b and I left
my purse inside.

561
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,551
So, where's tober?
He left earlier.

562
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:22,819
Jury duty, I think.

563
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,387
But he said to ask the super--

564
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:25,755
Hey, you're ozzie,
right?

565
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,592
Yeah.
But I've never seen you before.

566
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,694
Look, I know
this is awkward, okay?

567
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:31,895
I met calvin
last night.

568
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:33,830
He let me sleep in
while he went off.

569
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:36,333
Please.

570
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,401
I'm already so
late for work.

571
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:41,037
In our phase I and
phase ii trials,

572
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:43,573
We never once found
a causal link

573
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:46,576
Between zennapril
and brain stem stroke.

574
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:48,044
Mccloon:
Dr. Winsor,

575
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:50,547
Is it possible that mr.
Demory took a wrong

576
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:52,649
Dosage of zennapril
for his migraine headache?

577
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,552
Well, he shouldn't have taken
any zennapril at all.

578
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:57,621
It's not indicated for
headache relief.

579
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,089
Zennapril's not

580
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,891
Approved
for migraines?

581
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:02,659
Winsor:
No.

582
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,094
It's a powerful drug

583
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:07,063
Intended only for patients
suffering schizophrenia.

584
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:13,703
<i>Daniel:
I want to apologize
for last night.</i>

585
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:16,039
I sent that basket before
we had our conversation.

586
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,975
No one will ever
send you anything again.

587
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,043
Thank you.

588
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:22,012
(sighs)

589
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:24,214
(chuckles)

590
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,351
I, uh...

591
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,353
I don't mean to keep doing this.

592
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:33,356
I need to ask
another favor...

593
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,358
Regarding the videotape
that you gave me.

594
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,660
Okay.

595
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,229
On the tape was a present--
a bracelet.

596
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,532
I need you to look
for the receipt.

597
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:44,467
Why?

598
00:25:44,468 --> 00:25:47,437
I want to use the videotape to
try to get peter a new trial.

599
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:48,705
I think it's very effective.

600
00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:50,874
But I'm afraid that the
prosecution will suggest

601
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:53,410
That the present wasn't
paid for by peter.

602
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:55,545
Why would they
suggest that?

603
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:58,548
(sighs)

604
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:01,351
Mrs. Florrick, as you know,

605
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,086
Technically,
I don't represent you.

606
00:26:03,087 --> 00:26:04,888
I represent
your husband.

607
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:07,357
And so, as much as I would like
to be completely forthcoming,

608
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,293
In these circumstances,
I don't believe I can.

609
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:16,333
So kozko gave peter things,

610
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:18,802
And you believe peter
regifted these things--

611
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:22,138
This bracelet-- to me?

612
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:26,142
I can say this:

613
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:29,746
It would be helpful
if we could find the receipt.

614
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,942
(rattling)

615
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:05,849
Alicia...

616
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,318
If it's money
you're concerned about...

617
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,352
What?

618
00:27:09,353 --> 00:27:11,821
You don't have to be so proud.

619
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:13,990
I know you're carrying
a great deal

620
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:15,258
Of responsibility right now.

621
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,326
The rent alone...

622
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:18,194
Well, I just want
you to know

623
00:27:18,195 --> 00:27:20,864
That I have
more than enough room.

624
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:23,633
Oh!
You know, we're okay for now.

625
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:24,834
But thanks.

626
00:27:30,374 --> 00:27:31,541
(message alert beeping)

627
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,313
(line ringing)

628
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:40,950
Woman:
Yeah?

629
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,919
Hold on.
Kalinda?

630
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,588
Kalinda:
Hello?

631
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:47,023
Hi, it's alicia.
I'm returning your call.

632
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,191
Who was that?

633
00:27:48,192 --> 00:27:50,193
Donna.

634
00:27:50,194 --> 00:27:51,294
Look, I found out something

635
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,363
About juror number 11,
calvin tober.

636
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:55,732
I was talking to the super
in his building,

637
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,167
And he let me
into his apartment.

638
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:59,269
Why would he let you
into his apartment?

639
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,838
You really want to know?

640
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,807
No.

641
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,742
Here's the thing:
Tober's bank account--

642
00:28:05,743 --> 00:28:08,511
He just deposited
$20,000 in cash.

643
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:11,748
I think we have
our bribed juror.

644
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:24,527
Yes, it's ours.

645
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:25,628
You lost the receipt?

646
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:27,697
And I need a copy
for my tax records.

647
00:28:27,698 --> 00:28:28,664
It's a beautiful piece.

648
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,199
One of our finest.

649
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,235
When was it purchased?

650
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:33,436
Um...

651
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:34,937
February or March.

652
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:35,905
Maybe January.

653
00:28:35,906 --> 00:28:39,041
I'm sorry,
you said "florrick."

654
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:40,943
Yes.

655
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:43,012
I found the receipt, but
it's not under florrick.

656
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,014
Might it be under
a different name?

657
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,282
I'm not sure.

658
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:48,484
What name do you have?

659
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,953
I'm sorry,

660
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:53,489
I'm not able to give out
that information.

661
00:28:58,228 --> 00:29:01,464
Could the name be kozko?

662
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,700
I'm sorry.

663
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,969
I'm afraid I can't give out
that information.

664
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:12,008
<i>Kalinda:
Hey!</i>

665
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:14,176
So, I tracked down
tober's ex-wife.

666
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:16,746
She says he was five months
behind on alimony.

667
00:29:16,747 --> 00:29:18,881
Then last week,
he paid her ten grand.

668
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,784
He claims he took out a second
mortgage on his house.

669
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:23,519
Is that all?

670
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,788
Tober doesn't own a house.

671
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:30,159
Did you hear me?

672
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,761
Yeah.

673
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:33,596
Kalinda, do you know
someone named kozko?

674
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,598
Gerald kozko?

675
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,266
The real estate developer.

676
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:40,770
What does he have to do
with my husband?

677
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,306
I don't know-- does he have
anything to do with him?

678
00:29:43,307 --> 00:29:45,508
You worked at the state's
attorney's office for how long?

679
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:46,709
Two years.

680
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,377
Did you ever see anything?

681
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:49,845
Like what?

682
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:52,615
Payoffs, gifts--
I don't know.

683
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:54,884
I don't even know
if I want to know.

684
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:59,922
Look, you don't go to the
state's attorney's office

685
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,324
To find saints.

686
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:04,727
I'll get back to you
about tober.

687
00:30:04,728 --> 00:30:06,095
If his payoff's $35,000,

688
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,964
Then mccloon owes him
another $15,000.

689
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:11,534
My guess is he gets it
before deliberations.

690
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:13,669
That's at the end of today.

691
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,338
I better rush then.

692
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:19,141
Mccloon:
Objection, your honor!

693
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:21,911
This is a research document,
not promotional material.

694
00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:22,978
Judge:
Overruled.

695
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:25,414
Diane: Then let me
continue quoting:

696
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:28,517
"primary outcome for zennapril
include a 40% reduction

697
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:30,986
In the average frequencies
of migraines."

698
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:33,255
We test drugs for all
possible outcomes.

699
00:30:33,256 --> 00:30:35,491
It doesn't mean that
we recommend them.

700
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:40,563
Could you please
tell the court...

701
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:42,598
What this is, doctor?

702
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,266
Objection.
We haven't seen this.

703
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:46,836
Discovery materials, item 469.

704
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:47,970
I'll help you, sir.

705
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,873
This document is an
application to the emea,

706
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:53,542
Seeking approval to market
zennapril in europe

707
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:55,644
As a migraine medication.

708
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,114
Am I correct?

709
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:03,219
Yes.

710
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,020
Filed 20 months ago.

711
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:07,790
Dr. Winsor,

712
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:09,458
Would you please
tell the court

713
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:12,328
Whose signature is
on this application?

714
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,798
Uh, my signature.

715
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,400
Diane: No further
questions, your honor.

716
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:19,435
Then that concludes
the trial testimony.

717
00:31:19,436 --> 00:31:20,970
We'll finish the day
with summations

718
00:31:20,971 --> 00:31:22,104
And jury instructions,

719
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:24,507
And then ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

720
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:28,344
The trial moves
into your hands.

721
00:31:37,988 --> 00:31:39,889
(starts engine)

722
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:38,581
(quiet groan)

723
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:46,589
<i>Diane: And she's sure
it was a payoff?</i>

724
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,224
No. She saw an envelope
exchange hands,

725
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:50,426
But she doesn't know
what was inside the envelope.

726
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,094
And she didn't
see the driver?

727
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,996
No. She saw
a dark green suv.

728
00:32:53,997 --> 00:32:56,665
Uh, kalinda saw
a partial plate-- j15.

729
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:59,335
She's running it now,
crossing it with make and model,

730
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:00,836
But that could take a while.

731
00:33:00,837 --> 00:33:02,137
Start with mccloon's
legal team.

732
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:03,239
Oh, I don't know.

733
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,473
The jury's already
deliberating.

734
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:05,641
They've sent word to the judge

735
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:06,909
They may have a verdict
by today.

736
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,011
So if we pull the
trigger, we do it now.

737
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:10,579
Diane: I'd have to bring
the judge everything.

738
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,982
The place mat,
the $35,000, the alimony.

739
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:15,551
You request another juror now,
it'd be a definite mistrial.

740
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:16,752
(diane sighs
heavily)

741
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:19,188
Diane:
But I feel like the
jury was with me.

742
00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:20,890
I mean, the summation--
they were nodding.

743
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:22,525
They want to give this to us.

744
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:24,827
Yes, unless juror
11 torpedoes it.

745
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:27,596
Either way, we're
risking a mistrial.

746
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:28,898
Damn.
This is roulette.

747
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,332
This isn't law.

748
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,167
Will:
We're talking about

749
00:33:32,168 --> 00:33:34,537
A felony crime here;
we have an obligation.

750
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,542
(knocking on door)

751
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:42,811
The judge wants
you in chambers.

752
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,548
This should be interesting.

753
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:48,751
In the next ten minutes, we're
going to figure something out.

754
00:33:48,752 --> 00:33:50,719
You're honor, I would like
to request a private meeting.
Your honor, may I please...?

755
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,955
In the meantime,
I would like silence.

756
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,624
Not mccloon silence,

757
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,560
Not lockhart silence,

758
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:58,727
Just silence.

759
00:33:58,728 --> 00:34:00,062
Unless I point to you,

760
00:34:00,063 --> 00:34:01,997
You will
not speak.
Your honor?

761
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,299
Sergeant largon!

762
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:06,168
Sergeant, come in, please.

763
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,137
And wait right there.

764
00:34:08,138 --> 00:34:09,572
Anyone who speaks
without my permission

765
00:34:09,573 --> 00:34:11,040
Will be held in contempt.

766
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,508
Now, the jury
has reached a verdict.

767
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,809
I'm holding that verdict

768
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,477
Until we settle an issue
that has arisen.

769
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:19,715
The foreman has approached me
about being followed by someone

770
00:34:19,716 --> 00:34:21,684
From one of your legal teams.

771
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,319
Who would that be?

772
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:26,855
You may speak.
Your honor,

773
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,991
We have reason to believe
that mr. Mccloon bribed

774
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,159
One of the jurors.

775
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,393
We intended

776
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:33,095
To bring these charges
to your honor,

777
00:34:33,096 --> 00:34:35,664
But first, we wanted to be
certain of our information.

778
00:34:35,665 --> 00:34:38,067
And so you had one
of the jurors followed?

779
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:42,304
Mccloon:
Your honor,

780
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:43,505
I am stunned.

781
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:44,840
Judge:
Mr. Mccloon, without

782
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:46,275
The outrage, please.

783
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:48,510
Clearly, miss lockhart
has nothing solid,

784
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:50,012
And she's trying to torpedo

785
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:51,880
This verdict
before it comes in.

786
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,616
She's worried
it won't go in her favor.

787
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:55,084
Judge:
All right, miss lockart, I am

788
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:56,518
Holding you in contempt.

789
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,754
You owe the legal
defense fund $80,000

790
00:34:58,755 --> 00:35:00,789
To be paid no later than Friday

791
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,157
Of next week.

792
00:35:02,158 --> 00:35:03,792
And I think
I am damn well owed an apology.

793
00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:04,994
Judge:
Uh, uh, uh!

794
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:06,462
I did not point to you.

795
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:10,132
That'll be $10,000,
mr. Mccloon.

796
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,367
Now...

797
00:35:11,368 --> 00:35:13,602
We are all going back
into that courtroom,

798
00:35:13,603 --> 00:35:16,105
And we are all living
with this verdict.

799
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:18,807
If you have evidence
of jury tampering,

800
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:21,143
Miss lockhart,
take it up on appeal.

801
00:35:21,144 --> 00:35:22,344
Too many people
have selflessly

802
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:23,879
Invested their time

803
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,516
For your playground tactics
to throw this into a mistrial.

804
00:35:27,517 --> 00:35:29,184
Now, that's it.

805
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:02,217
Judge:
Ladies and gentleman
of the jury,

806
00:36:02,218 --> 00:36:05,153
Have you reached a verdict?

807
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,791
Yes, your honor.

808
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,328
Judge:
And what is your verdict?

809
00:36:14,898 --> 00:36:18,133
"we, the jury,
find for raymond demory

810
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,702
"and against

811
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:22,371
"the defendant zennapril
pharmaceutical.

812
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:25,708
"and we assess damages
in the sum of $800,000

813
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,076
"in compensatory damages

814
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:29,945
And three million
in punitive damages."

815
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:33,215
Judge:
Thank you for your service

816
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,683
To the state of illinois.

817
00:36:34,684 --> 00:36:36,185
The jury is dismissed.

818
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:37,853
Court adjourned.

819
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:40,622
(applause)

820
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:45,861
Settle, and I won't
pursue an appeal.

821
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:48,597
I still have
my class action clients.

822
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:51,533
Right. I'll get you some
numbers by the end of the day.

823
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:02,678
So, we were wrong?

824
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,847
It happens.

825
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,349
People sometimes
just look guilty.

826
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:10,452
Carol:
Alicia?

827
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,867
Thank you.

828
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,469
Oh, it was...
It was all diane.

829
00:37:30,106 --> 00:37:33,008
I want you to
have something.

830
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:38,180
These are the people
that you helped today.

831
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,753
(sighs)

832
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:45,954
Thanks again.

833
00:37:45,955 --> 00:37:46,955
(laughs)

834
00:37:46,956 --> 00:37:49,224
It really is amazing.

835
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,027
Is it?

836
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:53,829
Yes.

837
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,066
Ever been
to the hungry kitten?

838
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,068
The restaurant?

839
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,303
Sure. Ray loves it.

840
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:02,905
And you borrowed
our deposition books?

841
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,373
Yes.

842
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:06,108
Why?

843
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:10,012
Wow.

844
00:38:12,315 --> 00:38:15,484
Diane wanted us to look through
ray's earlier statements.

845
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,186
You didn't have to do it.

846
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:18,987
You would have won.

847
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,425
We did win.

848
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:55,557
They bribed
the foreman.

849
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:57,726
Our clients did.

850
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,202
They drive a
dark green suv.

851
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:09,204
Their license
plate prefix

852
00:39:09,205 --> 00:39:10,772
Is j15.

853
00:39:10,773 --> 00:39:14,243
There was no
whistle-blower.

854
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:16,445
Our clients bribed the jury.

855
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:20,349
Maybe.

856
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,617
No. It's true.

857
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:23,852
We need to bring this
to the judge.

858
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:25,320
We already did.

859
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,222
We brought our suspicions
to the judge,

860
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:28,857
And he overruled us.

861
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:32,895
<i>Yes, but now we know.</i>

862
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:36,665
We fulfilled our obligation
under the law.

863
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,068
It's wrong.

864
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:42,070
No.

865
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:45,207
We follow the law, alicia.

866
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,475
Sometimes it's wrong,

867
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:48,310
Sometimes it's right,

868
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:49,778
But we always follow the law.

869
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:54,983
And today, you helped a lot
of people in pain find justice.

870
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,567
(door rattling,
closes with an echoing bang)

871
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:15,037
Peter:
How are you doing?

872
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,672
Good.

873
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:18,974
I hear that work is going well.

874
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:20,742
It is. It's good.

875
00:40:20,743 --> 00:40:22,511
You sound like grace.

876
00:40:22,512 --> 00:40:23,912
"how's school?"
"good."

877
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:25,681
"how are your teachers?"
"good."

878
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,751
Are you having fun?

879
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:33,088
That's the most
important thing.

880
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:34,823
(laughs)

881
00:40:34,824 --> 00:40:36,425
Fun as disneyland.

882
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:38,694
Well, I'm... I'm, uh...

883
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:40,629
I'm glad you're making a life
for yourself.

884
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,664
It gives you a break
from this whole...

885
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:44,633
Situation.

886
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:46,201
Right, daniel?

887
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:49,972
Alicia can handle herself,
I know that.

888
00:40:52,775 --> 00:40:54,743
So...

889
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,478
(clears throat)
uh...

890
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:59,381
Daniel and I wanted to talk
to you about something.

891
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:03,752
Alicia, um, we've been going
over our appeal strategy,

892
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,886
And, um...

893
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:06,288
(clears throat)
...We need you to

894
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,423
Do something
that we didn't expect.

895
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:13,929
We need you to testify.

896
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:17,666
Peter:
I'm sorry,

897
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:20,035
But we have gone over this
every which way we could, and...

898
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:21,336
Daniel:
We need you to say

899
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:22,738
On the stand
when you found out

900
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:24,306
About the affair,
so that we can show

901
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:27,676
That peter was lying
to protect you.

902
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,614
Oh, um, from the affair.

903
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,815
Peter:
Well, I mean,

904
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:34,916
It's bill clinton
all over again.

905
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:37,085
Remember what we used
to say about him?

906
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:38,453
They were using sex
to crucify him.

907
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,055
They're doing
exactly the same thing to me.

908
00:41:40,056 --> 00:41:41,123
Crucifying you?

909
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,159
Daniel:
Alicia,

910
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,927
We need you to do this.

911
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,234
I wouldn't ask you
if I didn't need it.

912
00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:57,806
Will you testify?

913
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:05,314


914
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:09,718
