1
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,999
LOVE AND ANARCHY

2
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,040
Or

3
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:43,124
"This morning at 10:00 in Via dei Fiori,
in the well-known whorehouse..."

4
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,290
Mom, what's an anarchist?

5
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:48,249
Someone who kills kings and throws bombs,
then ends up on the gallows.

6
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,332
Now shut up.

7
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,249
Socialism's what we need, not anarchy
and people who end up on the gallows.

8
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,374
We need the people
who end up on the gallows too!

9
00:02:55,458 --> 00:03:00,457
As long as the world is for all of us,
brothers and sisters, equal and free,

10
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,124
all of us the same, like nature made us.

11
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,999
I came back to kill Mussolini.

12
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,624
<i>Love, love!</i>

13
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,124
Giovinó's is closed.
This is a first-class joint, you know?

14
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,499
We open at 11:00.
You'll have to wait.

15
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,999
<i>Bring me a lot of roses</i>

16
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,874
<i>And a whole lot more</i>

17
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:13,374
<i>Choose the thorniest ones</i>

18
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,957
Go clean the rooms.

19
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,707
<i>I'll press them to my heart</i>

20
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,957
Excuse me.

21
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,665
Do you have a hearing problem?
We're closed. We open at 1 1:00.

22
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,207
Don't start getting pushy!

23
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,540
Shit, you're really ugly.

24
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,790
Where in the hell did you come from?

25
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,082
Do you have any money?
You know, it's expensive here.

26
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,290
This is a first-class joint.

27
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,207
Do you know how much a fuck costs?

28
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,457
Seven lire.

29
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,332
You're scared?
What happened?

30
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,499
I'm here!

31
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,124
Odette, where's the clean laundry?

32
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,040
I've been looking for it for over an hour.
What a mess!

33
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:53,374
They never find anything in here.
Oh, dear Saint Rosalia.

34
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:58,457
If you're in a hurry to fuck, why don't you
go to Pellegrino's? It's cheap there.

35
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,540
Actually, why don't you give yourself
a nice hand job?

36
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,040
You'll have fun and save money.

37
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,124
Actually, I'm looking for Miss Salomè.

38
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,249
- Shit!
- I'm a relative.

39
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,207
Where is he?

40
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,582
Shit, Zoraide, you idiot!

41
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,374
Why did you wax the stairs?
Everyone is falling down.

42
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,832
Where is he?

43
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,540
There he is, my cousin.

44
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,499
Well, you've grown up, cousin.

45
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,582
You became a hunk, baby.

46
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,457
It's about time you arrived.

47
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:37,207
Sorry, I can't kiss you
with this stuff on my face. Beauty mask.

48
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,707
Zoraide, isn't he handsome?

49
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,874
How is my aunt? Does she still
have problems with varicose veins?

50
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,999
Come on up.
Let's get comfortable and talk.

51
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,374
Zoraide, can you tell Madam Aïda
I'm busy this morning?

52
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,415
I have a relative visiting.
Come this way. It's faster.

53
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,165
My room is the mirror room,
the best in the house.

54
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,207
It's straight out of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.
Just imagine that!

55
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,499
Come on. Follow me.

56
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,582
See what a beautiful house this is?
It's the most elegant house in Rome.

57
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,374
- Hey, who's that asshole?
- Shut up. He's a relative.

58
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,874
Carmela, the lieutenant of the house.

59
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,415
- Hello.
- Hello, my ass.

60
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,749
What about this morning at 11:00?
Who's gonna do it?

61
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,707
- Shut up. I'll ask Ivonne.
- Yes, ask Ivonne.

62
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,999
- My cousin has just arrived.
- The cousin, the cousin.

63
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,415
He comes here to get it.

64
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,790
Wait. I need to ask
a favor of a friend.

65
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,415
Ivonne?

66
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,332
No kidding.
She's snoring like a train.

67
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,999
Ivonne!

68
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,124
Would you shut up? Shit!

69
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,207
Oh, I'm sorry, milady,
for my loud voice.

70
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,374
- Sleep is sacred.
- I'm sorry, okay?

71
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,540
Introductions:
Miss Jacqueline, my cousin.

72
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,665
Who cares?

73
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,374
- What do you want?
- Some family business came up.

74
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,999
Can you take care of my morning shift?
My cousin is visiting.

75
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,540
Let me introduce you:
Ms. Ivonne, my cousin.

76
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,957
- Good morning!
- My pleasure.

77
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,707
Your cousin.
Meanwhile, I take it up the ass.

78
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,332
Quit busting my balls.

79
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,957
You owe me.

80
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,499
What's wrong?
Are you in love? Tunin!

81
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,749
Come on in.

82
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,165
Get comfortable.

83
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,874
- Excuse me.
- Come on! Leave him alone!

84
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,915
Look at all this stuff on the bed.

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,999
Come on.
Make yourself at home.

86
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:36,124
I'm sorry I said you're my cousin,
but this way they won't bother us.

87
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,957
Close the door.

88
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:43,707
Those idiots are always
walking up and down the hall.

89
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:48,624
So, you're Antonio Soffiantini,
alias Tunin, right?

90
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,915
I'm Salomè.

91
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,999
Pleasure to meet you.
How was the trip? Good?

92
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,707
Good.
Come here. Sit down.

93
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,999
Make yourself at home.

94
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,707
Shit, those idiots
haven't prepared my room yet.

95
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,832
I'm really sorry, but sit down.

96
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,874
Oh, sorry.

97
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,707
There we go.

98
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,874
Now, let's have a cup of coffee.

99
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,290
Okay?

100
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,957
Odette!
Two coffees, room nine, please.

101
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,165
Quickly!

102
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,374
So the news is confirmed.
We're all set.

103
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,832
Wednesday, July 8.
It's certain.

104
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,040
Tomorrow, we're going to the place.

105
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,915
By the way, those windows
I wrote to the comrades about?

106
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,290
They are right over the square,
just in case you prefer a rifle.

107
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,790
No.

108
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,665
I practiced with a handgun.

109
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,290
I don't trust rifles.

110
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,457
Rumba, the longer you touch it,
the longer it gets.

111
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,332
Rumba? Please.
You don't even know what the rumba is.

112
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,040
Leave me alone, whore!
Who do you think you are, huh?

113
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,999
- Excuse me!
- Watch it!

114
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,124
She's so ugly anyway.

115
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,165
Yeah. Who'd take her?

116
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,790
Coffee!

117
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:14,165
I'm not gonna bring you coffee,
shame of our land, you whore.

118
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,915
Come in.
Come in, Odette.

119
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,290
Finally, the coffee.

120
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,832
My mouth is like a toilet bowl
if I don't drink coffee in the morning.

121
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,540
Have you seen Madam Aïda?

122
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,624
- No.
- Okay, then.

123
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,415
But Donna Carmela has taken charge.
She's downstairs in the hall.

124
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,415
- Do I need to tell her anything?
- Let sleeping dogs lie.

125
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,790
But if she asks, tell her that I have guests
and not to bother me.

126
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,124
What are you looking at?

127
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,707
He's my cousin.
I'm almost his aunt.

128
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,332
Go. Go!

129
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,415
These snoopy ones
always think the worst.

130
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,457
And close the door, stupid!

131
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,874
How much sugar?

132
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,582
- One or two?
- Two, thank you.

133
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,207
So, I think we've said
everything there is to say.

134
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,499
You know, the information
should be accurate

135
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,999
because most of our clients
are very important people.

136
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,332
Military officials.
All the good ones.

137
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,624
Filthy and vain men
who like to talk about ceremonies.

138
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,082
May they all get cancer.

139
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,957
You can't imagine
how filthy those pigs are.

140
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,665
Well, good luck.

141
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,040
For July 8?

142
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,457
To July 8.

143
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,957
Listen.
Do you really come from Paris?

144
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,457
Don't tell me if it's a secret.

145
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,082
The less one knows
about these things, the better.

146
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,832
Well, let's hope we come back alive.

147
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,124
I don't know why I'm doing this,

148
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,832
because you're all crazy.

149
00:11:54,916 --> 00:12:00,790
I can't stand these "respectable" bastards
who create such a shitty world.

150
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,874
And you?
Isn't it the same for you?

151
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,124
You're still so young.

152
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,624
Otherwise, why would you be doing this?

153
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,249
I...

154
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,124
I hate tyrants.

155
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,624
But you...

156
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,165
Tell me the truth, Tunin.

157
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,665
You're not thinking about tyrants, are you?

158
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,040
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, fuck. Come on.

159
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,457
You're staring at my legs.

160
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,374
Those eyes look like
you're starving in front of a rotisserie.

161
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:41,165
I can't keep watching those eyes.

162
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,290
I'm sorry, but have you
ever been in a brothel?

163
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,207
Never.

164
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:54,999
When I was serving in Cuneo,
there were girls under the bridge...

165
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,790
but I've never been in a brothel.

166
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,249
Not even in Paris.
I was busy there.

167
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,082
Oh, well.

168
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,707
Why didn't you say something?

169
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,957
You’re just sitting there, so quiet,

170
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,165
looking at me like a hungry kitty.

171
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,707
Come on.

172
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:21,624
Given our plans, let’s just do it.

173
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,874
I'm actually very happy
to satisfy someone like you.

174
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,124
You never know.
It might even bring me some luck.

175
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,457
Come on. Come here.

176
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,290
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

177
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,665
Don't make a fuss about it!

178
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,832
If I don't like it,
it's the same anyway.

179
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:52,457
No, it’s just I still have to settle
into a hotel, find my room.

180
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,832
Maybe later,
if it's not too much trouble.

181
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,707
- Thank you.
- Sure.

182
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,415
We'll find some time, right?

183
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,290
But tell me, are you okay?

184
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:06,832
Thank you very much.

185
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:10,207
By the way, Pensione Margherita
is right around the corner.

186
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,374
- I got you a room there.
- Thank you, very kind of you.

187
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,124
Via Manziana. It's the first one
on the right after you leave.

188
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,457
If you need anything, don't hesitate.

189
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,124
Thank you.
Thanks for the thought.

190
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:27,749
Then, Tunin, when you get settled,
you can come back to eat.

191
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,040
Thanks.

192
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,582
I'll be waiting for you. Bye.

193
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,082
- Well, maybe...
- What?

194
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,332
Well...

195
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:46,290
Maybe I'll settle in later,
unless I'd be an inconvenience?

196
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,374
Sure, I told you.

197
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,790
You need some satisfaction.

198
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,957
Especially here with all these beautiful girls.

199
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,374
This way it's over with,
and you get your head back on track.

200
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,499
Exactly.
Thank you very much.

201
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,332
Come on.

202
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,040
Come here.

203
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,082
Anteo Zamboni.

204
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,790
The attack on Mussolini in Bologna.

205
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,832
- You were there?
- I was with Anteo.

206
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,124
But we weren't involved.

207
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,040
We were there, in Via Rizzoli.

208
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,415
It was around 5:30 p.m.

209
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,874
The procession with Mussolini's car
was passing by.

210
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,540
He was standing up
among all the black shirts.

211
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,499
Then suddenly a gun shot, loud.
I can still hear it.

212
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,290
Then complete confusion.

213
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,874
The shooter, a guy in his thirties,

214
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:57,165
threw the gun at Anteo's feet like a dirty snake,
and shouted, "It's him. It was him!

215
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,624
Get him! Get the killer!"

216
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,499
Then he disappeared, that coward!

217
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:07,499
I'll never forget Anteo,
not even if a hundred years go by.

218
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,124
Poor guy.

219
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,207
With that haircut and face.

220
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,624
So young, he looked like a baby.
1 5 years old.

221
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:19,040
He stared at me, all pale and sweaty.

222
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,832
He couldn't even find the strength
to say, "Help! It's not true!

223
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,790
I didn't shoot anybody! No!"

224
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:31,207
While those crazy bastards,
bastards in black shirts,

225
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:35,582
jumped on him like animals,
I was screaming.

226
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,832
They pushed me away.

227
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,082
And that's it.

228
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,624
They beat him so badly

229
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:48,499
that, back at the police station,
Balbo threw up when he saw him

230
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,207
and some leader from Brescia passed out.

231
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,415
That's how bad he was.

232
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,290
And then they constructed a bunch of bullshit

233
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:04,207
that served only to show
there are far more cops than citizens here.

234
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,249
And then they completely
pulverized the family, you know.

235
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,957
Why? What did they do?

236
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,207
Mammolo Zamboni, the father,

237
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,332
and the sister Virginia Tabarroni
were ex-anarchists.

238
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,999
You can imagine.

239
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,582
Thirty years in jail.
I can't even find out if they’re still alive.

240
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,999
The mother died in a madhouse last year.

241
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,040
But it's better that way.

242
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:33,999
And me, I was like a fiancée.

243
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:38,540
And in the middle of all that shit,
it was like I had leprosy.

244
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,499
So I left.

245
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,124
Oh, shit.
It was hell.

246
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,457
I changed my name, and here I am.

247
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,624
And here I am playing Salomè.

248
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,124
Here, yes, but to prepare everything for you!

249
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,165
To prepare this nice July 8.

250
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,874
You know, I promised myself and Anteo.
I promised those eyes crying for help.

251
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,207
I swore to him, "My love, someone will pay.

252
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,540
That bastard has to die!"

253
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,540
Enough now with these stories.

254
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,082
It's useless to talk about it anyway.

255
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,499
Salomè!

256
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,540
- Oh, Jesus! I'm sorry.
- I can't...

257
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,124
God damn it!

258
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,249
- I'm really sorry. May I?
- No, he's my cousin.

259
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,624
- It's an honor.
- I'm sorry. It's a pleasure.

260
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,624
I'm Tripolina.

261
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:54,165
Come on. Give him more chicken.
The salad too.

262
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,040
Eat, Tunin, it's good for you.

263
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,540
A big boy like you, used to the country.

264
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:04,999
You know, I don't like to send
a relative to the restaurant.

265
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,374
Madam Aïda, thank you.

266
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,124
It was kind of you
to invite him over for lunch.

267
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,874
Great! I've been waiting
for three hours!

268
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,249
- I said thank you, Madam.
- You're welcome.

269
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,457
Oh, shit, Madam, this egg is not fresh.

270
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,415
What? You're such a drag.

271
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,040
My eggs come fresh
every day from the country.

272
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,374
Fresh every day?

273
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,874
A little chick is going to hatch
any moment now!

274
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,415
What did she say?

275
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,082
She said that a little chick
is coming out any moment now.

276
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,707
Nice.

277
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,874
You have that little chick right up here.

278
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,707
- In this house, you eat very well.
- Oh, sure!

279
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,707
In Florence, at Madam Saffo's,

280
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,540
Madam Valeria got a chef from Paris
to please her girls.

281
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,457
Madam Valeria?
Who knows what's behind that?

282
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,707
What's the chef's name?

283
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,457
- René, maybe?
- Yes. Do you know him?

284
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:07,165
Darling, René isn't there for cooking.
He's there for sleeping. Let me tell you.

285
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,040
Forget the kitchen.
He's working in Valeria's bed.

286
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,749
- She's making him earn his money.
- And his food!

287
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,707
In Turin, at 1 3 Via Fratelli Calandra,
there you really eat like a king!

288
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:23,999
No, no. Young man, this is the house
where you eat the best.

289
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,957
You're the guest.
What do you think?

290
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,124
Actually...

291
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,290
the food seems great,
and there's plenty of it.

292
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,457
- Oh, sure. Like in the army!
- How nice. Funny girl.

293
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,915
How finicky.

294
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,290
All princesses on a pea.

295
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,457
You see how ungrateful they are, boy?

296
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,332
On Sunday, I even send them
to Faraglia for a sorbet.

297
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:03,082
If you listen to Madam, this is better
than Danieli's restaurant in Venice.

298
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:07,165
Don't remind me of Danieli's.
That was my realm, you know.

299
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,415
Yeah, when you used
to wash dishes there, baby.

300
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,624
- May you get cancer, fucking bitch!
- You get something, idiot.

301
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:18,374
You know, Tunin, I'm not like them.

302
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,874
I'm an artist.

303
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,790
You know what they used to call me
at the Salone Margherita?

304
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:26,457
Ivonne is the Italian Josephine Baker.
Just think of that.

305
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,707
Shut up, bitches!

306
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,832
What do you know about my life?

307
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:38,374
When I had on my silver dress
and my ostrich feathers,

308
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,707
the royal princes started salivating.

309
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,874
- Oh, no. Don't tell me she's gonna start singing?
- I was a star.

310
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,207
I still have my voice, you know.
Listen to me.

311
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,749
Idiots!

312
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:01,082
Ever since she got syphilis,
she's gone insane, that girl.

313
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,374
She's stupid.
What do you think, stupid?

314
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,290
You think we can't sing too?
Just listen.

315
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,290
- Bitch!
- Idiot!

316
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,957
Fuck you, you know?

317
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,874
They're really shouting!

318
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,207
They're giving me a migraine.

319
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:39,415
Ivonne, for crying out loud,
you're giving the baroness a migraine.

320
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,165
Baroness Fornigotti,
the baroness of the broken asses.

321
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:49,082
Well, well!
Stop it now! Enough!

322
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:53,457
- What is this? Where are we?
- Well, in a brothel, Madam.

323
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,207
No, baby.
This is not a brothel.

324
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,332
This is a <i>maison</i>.

325
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,874
Understand? Good.

326
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,707
If you don't, take your stuff
and get out of here!

327
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:05,957
She's right!

328
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:16,082
Go tell her I don't give a shit, spy!

329
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:20,582
I'm gonna tell her right now.
Fuck you!

330
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:26,040
Go ahead and tell her, you fucking bitch!

331
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,582
You eat. Don't pay attention
to these bitches. Eat.

332
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:46,749
That's where you copied your
Jean-Harlow-of the-Renaissance haircut.

333
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,415
Look.

334
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,415
Stick it up your ass, bitch!

335
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,957
Coffee!

336
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,790
Jesus! Don't get all sentimental listening
to a girl who makes a living with her genitals.

337
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,457
Beautiful. I like it a lot.

338
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,207
Now sing another one.
We still have time. Come on.

339
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,540
- I have to go now.
- But that was so beautiful.

340
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:46,124
- Don't be difficult. Just sing.
- You take the guitar.

341
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:59,707
Miss Salomè, you have a phone call.

342
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:03,582
Come on.
It must be Uncle.

343
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,790
You're such a pig.

344
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:23,540
Shut up.
We're on the phone.

345
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:26,874
I don't know, darling.

346
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:30,874
Sunday is a day of rest, you know.

347
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:36,124
What?
No, I said rest, stupid!

348
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:39,207
Listen, stop it.

349
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:43,582
It's all right, as long as
you promise to be a good boy.

350
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,749
But I have my cousin here with me.

351
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:51,749
Yes, poor guy. He's from the country,
and he looks like <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

352
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:55,957
I'm not gonna leave him alone
in a whorehouse. I can't!

353
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,332
Well, okay.
I'll ask Tripolina to come along.

354
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,707
Yes, it's all settled then.

355
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:07,540
Shut up, you filthy thing.

356
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,749
Okay, bye-bye.

357
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:12,332
Shit! I did it!

358
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,040
Do you know who that was?
That was Spatoletti.

359
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:17,749
Do you know how lucky we are?
Tomorrow we'll go together.

360
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,749
- But who's this Spatoletti?
- Are you kidding?

361
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:25,040
He's the one who positions the secret service
around the piazza to protect Mussolini.

362
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:28,874
I've been after him
for three months, that pig.

363
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:33,124
That son of a bitch was part
of the first squads, you know?

364
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:56,832
Listen. Do you think we're blankets?
Leaving us there under the sun?

365
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:59,707
There'll be so many people
that we won't see shit!

366
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:02,624
And I'm pissed off
because I wanted to see Mussolini.

367
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:03,957
Calm down, honey.

368
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,790
Spatoletti is here!
I'll find you a first-class spot.

369
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:11,957
No, I wanna stay close to you,
or at least one of your secret agents.

370
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:15,207
You know, if they're secret,
a lady nearby can be useful.

371
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:19,249
- But will there be other secret agents?
- Yes, 35 of them.

372
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,874
Imagine!

373
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,790
- 35! That's right!
- That's too many!

374
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,749
Security is all my responsibility!

375
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,374
As long as Spatoletti is there,
Italy can sleep tight.

376
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,290
Damn it! They just have to try,
and I'll break them.

377
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,624
Watch out if they touch the Duce!

378
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,415
You drive like a madman!
I'm never riding with you again!

379
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,582
Romoletto, what beautiful girls
I've brought you!

380
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:28,832
- Hands off!
- Come on, honey. Let's eat.

381
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:32,582
- Keep your hands off me.
- I'm starving for your ass too.

382
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:37,165
- Hands off. Come on.
- I'm so hungry, I could eat a cow.

383
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,540
Sit down.
Come on, everyone!

384
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:42,290
So what's cooking, Romoletto?

385
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:46,332
- Today, bucatini all'amatriciana...
- Bucatini all'amatriciana.

386
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:49,790
You've got everything, Romoletto.
Good, good.

387
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,040
Here we go. Quickly.

388
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:54,915
Who are they? Your daughters?
They're beautiful, nice and firm.

389
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,207
Fortunately, they weren't ready
for use yet in 1 922.

390
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,790
Otherwise...

391
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:05,082
The whole Tamburini squad, 2,000 of us.
We camped out here for the march on Rome.

392
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:08,040
- Do you remember, Romoletto?
- Yes, I remember.

393
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,332
Since then, they call me "Five and three-eight".

394
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,082
"Five and three-eight," right.
Who was it?

395
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,957
Chiusini or Govoni?

396
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:19,624
We were probably hungry,
drunk on bad wine from Castelli.

397
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:21,457
We weren't gentle.

398
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:27,124
He was late bringing the chicken.
I remember he said, "You need to be patient."

399
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:31,915
And zap!
A knife cut off two of his fingers.

400
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,415
You understand.
Patience? Us Fascists?

401
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,790
Romoletto!

402
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,790
We were on the edge.

403
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,207
That was during the revolution, right?

404
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,999
We were making the Italy of Mussolini.

405
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:49,124
And if Romoletto gave two fingers up,
you have to feel honored.

406
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,332
It's like you have a medal this big!

407
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:55,415
Sure, I'm honored!
But there's a little political problem.

408
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,832
Ifyou'll forgive
my impertinence, Commander,

409
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:01,790
when I make the Roman salute,
it looks like I'm making the sign of a cuckold!

410
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,665
I wouldn't want Mussolini to be offended.

411
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:09,124
Damn, that's funny!
I think they understand.

412
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,290
Romoletto, I —

413
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,915
Salomè, don't sit like that,
because I'm going to jump you.

414
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,457
I will split you open.

415
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:27,040
You bitch, you do it on purpose
because you like me.

416
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:32,082
My little puppy, isn't it true
that I make your mouth water?

417
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:36,249
Everyone knows that
I love macho men like you.

418
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:41,624
But then, you filthy villain,
who can resist you?

419
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:46,665
- Romoletto!
- What are you screaming for, damn it?

420
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,874
At once, Commander!

421
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:52,874
Romoletto, hurry up!
I'll throw you in jail, damn it!

422
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,707
- I'm hurrying!
- Run!

423
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:58,207
Tunin, listen. I'll keep him in the room
for a couple of hours, okay?

424
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,999
You're going with that asshole now?

425
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,499
Stupid. I'll get him
to explain the ceremony in detail.

426
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:05,415
In the meantime,
check out the square. All right?

427
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,124
- Blondie, are we going?
- Yes, calm down.

428
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,790
And if it's true that you have a soft spot
for me, this time I want proof.

429
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,874
Yes, baby. Look.

430
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:20,207
Honey, if you if you really liked me,
you could do it for free occasionally.

431
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:26,249
I promised myself. When my fiancé left me
pregnant at 1 6, I promised myself.

432
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,790
Not even with the pope.
I'd rather close down business.

433
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,707
The exception confirms the rule.
Come on.

434
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:34,040
No, Commander! I told you.

435
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,207
Free, not even for his sanctity, Pius XI.

436
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,749
Today's Sunday.
The rate is 1 2 lire. So?

437
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:43,790
- Why won't you give me the satisfaction?
- Twelve lire or nothing.

438
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,707
- So?
- So, I'll give you the 1 2 lire.

439
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,874
How generous. For 12 lire.

440
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:52,290
- You could have done it once!
- Sure!

441
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:55,332
- With a Tuscan big spender like you.
- For love!

442
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,040
- What love? Enough!
- You cynic.

443
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,749
You've been destroying my buttocks
since this morning.

444
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,999
You love me so much.
I can feel it.

445
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,624
I'm gonna do you in the ass right now.

446
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:11,332
Well, he did it. He finally gave me
a headache with that voice.

447
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:15,207
- You too?
- Yes, madam.

448
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,082
Madam?
My name is Tripolina.

449
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,749
Like the song.
"Tripoli, beautiful land of love."

450
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,874
I was looking for an eccentric name.
Tripolina came out.

451
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:29,290
Maybe I've always liked Africa, the palms,

452
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,082
Rudolph Valentino doing <i>The Sheik.</i>

453
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,290
How stupid!

454
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:41,207
Well, instead you could have
called yourself Curly.

455
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,249
Yes, Curly.

456
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,499
The country is so beautiful,
lots of fresh air, so green.

457
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,749
I like it.

458
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,374
It's very hot today.
It's time to go swimming.

459
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,915
- Do you like the sea?
- I've never seen it.

460
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,665
You've never seen the sea?

461
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,957
I've always lived in the country.

462
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,374
That's why you've got such a clean face.

463
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,624
You're a great dancer.

464
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:56,957
I get by.

465
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,999
What are you looking at?

466
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,915
Don't look at me like that.
You're making me sad.

467
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:16,624
I'm sorry, but I wasn't looking at you.
I was thinking.

468
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,707
You were looking at me,
but you didn't see me.

469
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,374
Can't we play something happier?

470
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,749
I don't know.
A fox-trot? A one-step?

471
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,540
Here.

472
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,957
Miss...

473
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,124
If I may, I'll change the record.

474
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,915
Good. You take care of it.

475
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,749
I'll go back to my boyfriend.

476
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,457
Here you are.

477
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,874
- Why did you leave like that?
- Why?

478
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:50,624
- Are you angry?
- Not me.

479
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:53,165
- Did I do something?
- What? No.

480
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,957
And so?

481
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,957
I'm sorry, but can't you explain?
What happened to you?

482
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,499
Why did you leave me?

483
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:13,415
Well, I just went for a walk.

484
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:18,332
- Why? Are you upset?
- A little.

485
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:21,249
I'm sorry.

486
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:25,207
- You didn't get offended, did you?
- Well, yes!

487
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:28,624
- I'm sorry.
- You'd better be.

488
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:34,290
Oh, well. It's okay.
You know, there was a guy after me.

489
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:44,207
Do you know what I told him?
That you were my boyfriend.

490
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:45,332
Do you mind?

491
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,124
I wish.

492
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,415
What?
Are you kidding?

493
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,707
What a face.

494
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:00,832
Why are you always so down?

495
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,665
Tell me.

496
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,290
Nothing. It's like that.

497
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,332
- Maybe because it's spring.
- Yeah, spring.

498
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,290
Beautiful cows.

499
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:20,415
I love the smell of lemons.

500
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,624
Smell.

501
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,040
You smell it too.

502
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:27,832
Do you like it?

503
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,999
Funny.

504
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,707
This morning, I was thinking
it's too bad you're Salomè's cousin.

505
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:37,457
Otherwise...

506
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:41,332
- Otherwise, what?
- Stupid.

507
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:44,415
We could... do it.

508
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,540
But actually...

509
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,790
I just don't feel like it anymore.

510
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:54,957
I just can't do it,
and I don't understand why.

511
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,415
Why?

512
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,040
Because if you don't like somebody,
you just don't like them. That's all.

513
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,290
Basically, it's because you don't like me.

514
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:13,082
No, I do like you.

515
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:15,832
Too much.

516
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,749
That's why it's better not to.

517
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:43,415
What do you mean no, damn it? Yes!

518
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:51,874
May I?

519
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,915
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

520
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,499
If you want, I have a little room.
It's my brother-in-law's.

521
00:43:57,583 --> 00:44:00,790
- Look, I —
- We don't, well, allow it,

522
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:03,374
but for Commander Spatoletti,
if you would like to...

523
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,832
I'm serious.
You're doing me a favor.

524
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:10,165
I have those two little girls around.
If they came here...

525
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,915
They're two angels.
I wouldn't like...

526
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,124
- You understand.
- I really...

527
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:19,374
The lady and gentleman understand me, right?
Please, no compliments.

528
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:22,457
Please, make yourselves at home.

529
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,040
Follow me.

530
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:32,374
Looks like my parents' home.

531
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:38,790
Look. Like my mother, always knitting.

532
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:44,249
She knits here and she knits there.

533
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:49,457
Then, after all that knitting,
we don't have any socks.

534
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,582
Hey, Curly.

535
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,707
Come on, don't act stupid.

536
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:14,582
Don't cry.

537
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:18,707
Oh, Jesus, what's happening to me?

538
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:22,040
Listen, get undressed.
Let's make love.

539
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,540
Why all this respect for me?

540
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:29,082
Did you forget who I am?
I'm Tripolina!

541
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,915
What are you waiting for?

542
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,332
Get undressed. Come to bed.

543
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:37,374
Let's make love, right now,
so I can get rid of this craziness!

544
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:39,999
What's happening to you?

545
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:41,999
Calm down, okay?

546
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,124
Come on. Calm down.

547
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:45,499
What are you waiting for?

548
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:48,290
At the whorehouse, they wait in line
to make love to Tripolina.

549
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:51,415
Come on.
Let's make love.

550
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:54,999
Let's do it, and maybe
you'll give me a present later.

551
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,957
Come here!

552
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,499
Take off your pants, quick.

553
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,624
Stop looking at me with those eyes,
those beautiful eyes.

554
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:06,499
Get undressed. Let's make love
without problems, without staring.

555
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,749
I'm good. Come on!

556
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:10,999
Stop it, damn it!

557
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,207
Stop.

558
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23,790
Listen...

559
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:28,124
it doesn't have to be like this.

560
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:33,957
Everything becomes bad like this.

561
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:44,415
It could be nice, couldn't it?

562
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,624
Don't hurt me.

563
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,790
Hurt you?

564
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:12,124
We'll be nice to each other, Curly.

565
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,207
Oh, my God!
Did you see your cousin?

566
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,540
He's been screwing for three hours.

567
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,665
Who could imagine it? That loser.

568
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,665
Shut up, you pig!
Tunin is a country boy.

569
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:36,124
He's never had this kind of fun.
Let him get it out of his system.

570
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:39,874
Getting it out of his system is fine,
but is he going to do it 1 2 times?

571
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,374
Who is he? Joe Fuck?

572
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:44,415
He's a loser!

573
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,624
He's an artichoke without the sauce.
He's probably sleeping.

574
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,249
Cousin!

575
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:51,874
If you're sleeping, wake up!
And if you 're fucking, put your pants on!

576
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,665
It's time to go! It's late!

577
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,582
Move it!

578
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:59,457
Get your ass down here!
Put your undies on!

579
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:03,457
I'm gonna kick his ass.

580
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,290
It's very late.

581
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:20,540
Zoraide will kill us
for waking her up at this hour.

582
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:24,707
Look! You snagged my hose.
You'd better buy me new ones!

583
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:27,874
What the hell are you doing?
You idiot!

584
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,124
- Come here, sugar.
- Let go of me!

585
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,707
Just feel that nice, hard ass.

586
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:36,790
Salomè, fucking is good for you.
You're a flower.

587
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,374
Are you coming tomorrow?

588
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,749
Come after 11:00, when we're closed.

589
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:46,415
I'll be waiting.

590
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:53,040
- We can do it up against the wall.
- Stop it.

591
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,207
- I told you I'm tired!
- Fuck you.

592
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:59,040
- Did you hear that?
- God fucking damn it.

593
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:03,374
And you're having the altar boy
defend you, that freckle-face.

594
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,874
You asshole. Don't even joke,
or I'll kick your ass!

595
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:11,249
- Don't even think of provoking Spatoletti.
- Come here now. What are you doing?

596
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,415
You fucking men.
Let us sleep. Fuck!

597
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,707
Did you see that?
You heard Zoraide? Stop it.

598
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:18,874
Move it, Tripoli.
You go to bed.

599
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:21,415
Come on. Don't go.
Stay here with me.

600
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,457
- That's enough!
- What are you doing tomorrow?

601
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:28,540
Stop it now! Enough!
You've been pinching my ass all day!

602
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,832
- Come back here!
- That's enough, you pig.

603
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,999
Listen, witch!

604
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:35,082
Where do you think
you're working? In a church?

605
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,915
This is a whorehouse, thank God.

606
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,999
And the ladies are whores.

607
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:41,707
Hours are hours,
and we're closed, faggot!

608
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,540
Faggot? You bitch!

609
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:49,707
Call your own son a faggot!
Got it?

610
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:52,374
Did you hear that?
Me, a faggot?

611
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:56,832
Well, Zoraide can say whatever she wants.
I've known her for 1 0 years.

612
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:59,624
I could use a drink.

613
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,749
My turn.

614
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:10,957
Nice day.

615
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:14,040
We ate, we drank, we laughed,

616
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:18,582
we belched, we fucked,
we farted and we fought.

617
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:22,374
What more do you want?
A perfect Sunday.

618
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,624
You know what we're gonna do now?

619
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:27,207
We're gonna take a nice walk.

620
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:29,124
I think it's getting a bit late.

621
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:31,374
Don't be an asshole.

622
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:34,207
Don't you feel the fresh breeze?

623
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:39,915
At this hour, I get that old longing
to run around raising hell like I used to.

624
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,832
Like when our squad used to go out
and funnel castor oil down the anarchists' throats.

625
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:48,040
Those were the days.

626
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:23,374
Greetings, Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

627
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:26,749
From up there, you can see the lights
in Palazzo Venezia, can't you?

628
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:30,165
That's where he is.
He works for everybody, even for you.

629
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,332
Duce, you're the light.

630
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:34,624
It's true.

631
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,749
If I was you, Emperor,
I wouldn't be so calm on that horse.

632
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:41,040
Some day, they might take you down
and put him up there.

633
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:43,499
What a man.
What a man, God damn it!

634
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:45,207
Have you ever seen him up close?

635
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:48,915
No? Then you don't understand shit.
When I see him, I tremble.

636
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,332
He's got a pair ofeyes
that could bring the dead back to life.

637
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:56,624
If you see them, you'll understand
he could take the whole world if he wants.

638
00:52:56,708 --> 00:53:00,374
Let me tell you something.
A superman like him is only born once in a century.

639
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:05,207
There aren't many men
who have balls like that.

640
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:06,999
And the rest?
What are the rest?

641
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,874
Losers, common people.

642
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:17,124
The masses, the beggars, hungry little men.

643
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:19,415
Ready to shit themselves
and drop their pants for nothing.

644
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,665
They would even sell their sister
and their ass for a piece of bread.

645
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,415
That's the people.
The people.

646
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,624
Those socialist pigs were fattening
themselves offof the people.

647
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,457
Damn them!

648
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,540
It's because they're so poor, Commander.

649
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:37,040
You know, courage is for gentlemen.

650
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:40,790
Me, for example.
I'm from a farming family.

651
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:49,290
And my mother, the priest
and everybody taught me this:

652
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:55,207
"Better to kneel down and live
than stay put and die."

653
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:59,374
There it is.
The morale of the losers.

654
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:02,499
Well, now we can make them have the balls.

655
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:05,915
All they need is an iron fist
and some orders.

656
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,082
And ifthey refuse to understand,
beat them, by God!

657
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,957
- Give me the bottle.
- Oh, sure.

658
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:14,249
But, Commander, that's dangerous,

659
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,832
because you could end up
like the innkeeper.

660
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:18,499
What kind ofshit are you talking?

661
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:24,207
In my town, the innkeeper had a dog.

662
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:28,540
He was always kicking him
in the ass, every day.

663
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:32,749
But the poor dog always went back
to the innkeeper, good as ever,

664
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,707
licking his hand,
so he would feed him scraps.

665
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,874
He was hungry, you know?

666
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:40,207
And the innkeeper kept kicking him.

667
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:43,457
But one day, the dog got angry,

668
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:46,249
and after the first kick, he started to bite.

669
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,790
And then?

670
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:51,665
You won't believe it,
but he never let go of the innkeeper

671
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:56,124
until he saw him dying on the ground
with foam coming out of his mouth.

672
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:56,874
Well?

673
00:54:56,958 --> 00:55:01,707
What I mean is that maybe one evening
a loser, a crazy loser like me —

674
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:04,124
He's gonna be pissed off.

675
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:07,582
You come along
with your iron fist, and zap!

676
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:10,332
That guy stabs you
in the stomach, for example.

677
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:15,624
The man hasn't been born
that could stab Spatoletti.

678
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:19,499
You never know in this world.

679
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,332
Really, I'm serious.

680
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:26,540
With all these poor people,
you never know what someone could do.

681
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:28,290
I'm talking about the stabbing.

682
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:30,832
Maybe one day someone will think of it.

683
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:33,874
There are so many desperate people.

684
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:36,624
Desperate people are crazy.

685
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,457
I don't give a shit!

686
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:57,374
It feels so good here
in the arms of the god Tevere.

687
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:02,374
You feel likeJupiter, god of Rome.

688
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:07,290
No place is better than Rome,
and you can see everything from up here.

689
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:10,040
Weakness, betrayal, scumbags.

690
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:13,499
How many do you hide?
Rome, the capital.

691
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:18,457
Seven hills full ofshit and snakes.
We have to do more than just dust the corners.

692
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,374
If he would listen to me,

693
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:23,624
opportunists, anarchists,
traitors, subversives,

694
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26,040
we should have gotten rid of them.

695
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:29,790
Even today, I'd just need a sign.
Imagine, it's fun for me. It's like a party.

696
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:35,374
I've killed over 1 00 with these hands,
but now we have to be good.

697
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,374
According to him, we need to be politicians.

698
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:39,415
You know what?

699
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,999
I'll probably go wake up Salomè,
that beautiful witch.

700
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:44,915
What a woman.

701
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,499
You know, a Fascist doesn't pay women.
He takes them.

702
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:53,040
But with Salomè, it's another story.
You pay her, all right.

703
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:55,040
Because she's got something special.

704
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:58,207
So much that there's a line
at the brothel for her.

705
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:01,540
Because she's a real tramp.

706
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,040
I don't know if you can understand,
being her cousin.

707
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,749
But your Tripolina doesn't have anyjuice.

708
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:08,707
I've been with her.

709
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:11,165
I know a thing or two about whores,
and poor little Tripolina...

710
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,415
Shit! Enough now!

711
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,624
You've been bragging all evening!

712
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:17,874
- Enough!
- You idiot!

713
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,165
- Stop busting my balls!
- Get out of here!

714
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,874
- I'll smash your face in!
- You pain in the ass!

715
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:25,874
Don't even mention their names!
Got it, asshole?

716
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:30,665
- All this for Tripolina?
- I'm not the loser. Guys like you are!

717
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:34,332
Oh, boy, the baby's in love.
In love!

718
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:38,207
Watch it! I can be a tiger!
I'll kickyour ass!

719
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,499
I'll slaughteryou!
I'm gonna have your balls for dinner!

720
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:43,249
I'll smash your face!

721
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:50,082
You're crazy!
Look at this loser!

722
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,207
He's in love,
and he takes it out on me.

723
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,040
You're right.
I feel sorry for you.

724
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:59,874
You're drunk as hell!
It's a good idea to run away, asshole!

725
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:04,624
If I catch you, I'll throw you in the fountain
and sober you up Spatoletti-style.

726
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:07,207
Run away! They're whores!

727
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:10,707
<i>My love, my love</i>

728
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:15,207
<i>Why are you a whore?</i>

729
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,624
Did you hear that, Caruso?

730
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,999
Are you fucking crazy?
You're still here? Shut up!

731
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:50,540
- I wanna come in.
- Who is it?

732
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:53,874
My Lord. This faggot again.
Do you wanna let us sleep?

733
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:56,540
Tripoli, my ass.
Will you go away?

734
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:59,749
Do I have to call the police?
You're drunk!

735
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:02,124
Slam the door in his face,
or he'll throw up on the rugs.

736
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:04,707
Go, go, go! I'll call the police!

737
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,374
Close the door!

738
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:09,582
Will you leave already, you ugly bastard?

739
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:11,457
Think you're smart?
Slam that door!

740
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:13,415
His foot's in the door!

741
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,207
- Take out your foot, asshole.
- No, ma'am.

742
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:19,290
- Tripoli!
- Is he Salomè's cousin?

743
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:23,707
Yes, let me in.
I want in, Madam.

744
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:27,457
Come in? At this hour?
Are you crazy?

745
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:30,540
- Go! Get out! Close the door.
- Madam, be nice!

746
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,207
Go away, on two feet!

747
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:34,832
Actually, just one!

748
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:39,665
Shit, right on my big toe!

749
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:43,499
Fuck!

750
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:49,374
- You hurt me!
- I meant to hurt you.

751
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:52,165
You old witch!
This isn't the way. Hurting people.

752
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,915
You can walk, so go to bed.

753
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,499
Go to sleep and come back tomorrow
to visit Salomè, maybe at lunchtime.

754
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,165
Ugly baboon.

755
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:05,874
She broke my foot,
and my shoes were already hurting me.

756
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:10,124
Shit, my toenail is gonna come off.

757
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:17,124
Go away, you!

758
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:20,499
Go, stupid! Go away!

759
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:22,999
What do you want from me?

760
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:27,124
What is it you want from me?
What are you trying to do?

761
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:29,165
Go away.

762
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:32,999
Bye, kitty. Bye, stupid!

763
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,874
You don't give up, huh?

764
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,665
Go home, kitty.

765
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,707
Why are you following me?

766
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:47,624
I'm not a pussycat.

767
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:49,957
And you're young for those things.

768
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:54,124
You're still here?

769
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:03,624
Did your cats kick you out like me?

770
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:10,624
You feel lonely, don't you, kitty?

771
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:19,457
It's dark, isn't it?

772
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:23,124
Maybe it's because of all these lights,

773
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:28,540
but the night is scarier here in the city
than in the country.

774
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:30,957
It's darker.

775
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,957
Why are you purring?
You're comfortable in my arms.

776
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:39,957
Listen to me.
Go look for a warm corner.

777
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:45,165
Because you're better off losing me
than finding me. Got it?

778
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:49,249
You're lonely. You're so lonely.

779
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:51,665
Holy Mary, this Rome...

780
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,415
Just look at this Rome.

781
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,290
Shit, what a city, Rome.

782
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,749
Hey, little kitty.

783
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:01,374
Do you have a home?

784
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:04,165
I have a hotel.
I'm gonna take you there now.

785
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,665
But listen,
you're making a big mistake,

786
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:10,832
because, friend, today I'm here,

787
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,582
but tomorrow who knows where I'll be?

788
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:57,040
Boy, you're a sharpshooter.
Where did you learn, in the army?

789
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,915
No. Another round, please.

790
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,624
My God, you've been shooting all morning.

791
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,249
It clears my head.

792
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:09,707
For that, you need a girlfriend, not a rifle.

793
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:11,874
- Right.
- Boy, I'll read your palm.

794
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,457
I'll tell your future. Yes?

795
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:14,915
No.

796
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,874
No, better not,

797
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,499
but thanks for the thought.

798
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:22,499
- Nice of you.
- So do you have a girlfriend or not?

799
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:25,749
- More or less.
- Yeah?

800
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:29,582
Why aren't you with her
if you need to clear your head?

801
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:32,207
She's working.

802
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,915
What does she do?

803
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:41,290
Will you tell me
what your girlfriend does?

804
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:44,749
Commerce.

805
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:49,457
Come on, beauties.
We're opening the whorehouse.

806
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:16,165
- Hello, prostitutes!
- Fuck you!

807
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:22,540
Professor Flannel!

808
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:24,082
How rude.

809
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:28,165
What's with all the long faces this morning?
Everybody's a faggot this morning.

810
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,874
Get them up to the rooms!

811
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:35,749
Look, professor, let's go to my room.
The first fuck is always the best.

812
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:38,499
Let's go, guys!

813
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:41,874
I don't have time to waste.
I don't like you anyway.

814
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,832
What's your name, honey?

815
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,665
So, what are we going to do, sir?

816
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:48,290
What's this crowd this morning?

817
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:51,957
The Fascist gathering is going on.

818
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:54,124
I don't understand why
whenever there's a military ceremony,

819
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:56,082
everybody winds up in the whorehouse.

820
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:57,540
Maybe it's the brass band?

821
01:07:57,625 --> 01:08:00,707
See? Looks like it's going
to be a good morning.

822
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:02,624
There's a crowd, Madam.

823
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:06,207
Is there a problem?
Introduction maybe?

824
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,290
What are you, gay? Come on.

825
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:12,957
Why are you all still dressed?
Come on. Go up to the rooms.

826
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:15,374
God bless you!

827
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:19,082
Where do you think you are?
In the barracks?

828
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,040
Carmela, don't you recognize me?
What an ass!

829
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:26,124
It's like a flower today.
Who's gonna deflower me this morning?

830
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:28,999
Me, beautiful. Thank you.

831
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:33,457
Bologna's arriving on track 4.

832
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:35,957
What a blonde.

833
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:40,040
What a crowd.
Salomè from Bologna is here.

834
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:44,415
I've got 1 5 minutes free.
Any gourmets want to try a new dish?

835
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,540
Shoot. What a pain.
Whoever wants me, follow me.

836
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,832
Let's go, baby.

837
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:52,790
Come on, honey.
I'll show you a little piece of heaven.

838
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:56,374
Let's go, let's go.
This morning is not that good, girls.

839
01:08:56,458 --> 01:09:00,082
Tripoli, land of love.

840
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:03,290
Tripolina's coming!

841
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,832
Hey, you. Is he deaf?

842
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,290
What a beautiful beard, professor.
Are we going up?

843
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:11,582
Yes, sweetie.

844
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:15,832
God damn it.
The flight arrives, and it departs again.

845
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:18,749
Did you see that? The salon,
and then straight back to the room.

846
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:20,999
They should give her a medal, like Balbo.

847
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:23,499
Have you lost your head
looking at all these nude women?

848
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:27,165
What have you done so far this morning?

849
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,749
- You're a student.
- Be nice.

850
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,040
- You've got no money.
-Just five minutes.

851
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,957
Go away. Get out.

852
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:35,665
Take them up to the rooms, gentlemen.

853
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:39,499
What a lovely fresh bunch of girls
we have this morning!

854
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:46,790
Tunin, what are you doing here?

855
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:48,457
- Here for breakfast?
- No.

856
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:49,249
No?

857
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:53,874
Don't tell me you're a client?
For relatives, I have a special deal.

858
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:57,374
I'm all yours, okay?
Obviously, after hours.

859
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:01,124
I've got to go.
Today's a busy day for fucking.

860
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:05,374
Listen. Go for it. I feel crazy today.
I'll give you a half hour—

861
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:06,957
Did you want something?

862
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:09,540
As I was saying, go for it.
I'm in a bad mood today.

863
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:12,040
I'm gonna show you
my whole repertoire, like in a movie.

864
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:16,582
What do you want?
Leave me alone!

865
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:18,624
Wanna try some Bolognese pasta?

866
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:22,124
Try me out, honey!

867
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,957
You want to 69, handsome?

868
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,915
Come here, handsome.

869
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,915
Admiral...

870
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,790
Sailor...

871
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:41,624
Faggot.

872
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:48,624
Hey, look who's here.
The cousin.

873
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:51,832
Are you looking for Salomè?
She's fixing herself up.

874
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:55,749
She picked a fat turkey,
the honorable Pezzotto's son.

875
01:10:55,833 --> 01:11:01,374
She got him in her room.
She screwed him for a half hour.

876
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:04,915
She can smell a rich one a mile away.

877
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,374
Now where's that ship captain?

878
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:10,415
Oh, ship captain!

879
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,957
Bye, Fefé.

880
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:15,665
Come again.
I'll treat you nice.

881
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,249
It's hot! I'm dying.

882
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:21,832
Worse than in Catania.

883
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:25,040
Have you been to Catania?

884
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:27,457
Yes or no?

885
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:29,165
What's wrong?

886
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,415
Bye-bye, and come back to visit me, professor.

887
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:38,457
Hey! Tripolina's here.

888
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:48,790
Hey, it was my turn.

889
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,624
Where are you going, son of a bitch?

890
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:05,582
Here, damn it. I'm paying.

891
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:07,665
I've got the same rights as anyone else.

892
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,082
Seven lire, shit.

893
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:13,165
Quick. This is rush hour.

894
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:16,290
We're crowded today.
Let's move it.

895
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,040
No. Tunin, no.
That's private.

896
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:21,249
Tunin!

897
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:31,540
Well, what's this?

898
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,707
I'm sorry.

899
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:37,582
Look. Leave me alone, okay?

900
01:12:37,666 --> 01:12:39,999
- What did you do?
- What? Leave you alone?

901
01:12:40,083 --> 01:12:42,499
Tunin, wait.
Listen, Tunin.

902
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:46,040
- The cousin with Tripolina?
- Tunin, open up. You're pissing me off!

903
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:49,999
That's funny.
He wants a good fuck, does he?

904
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:54,207
Hey, Salomè, are you jealous?

905
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:57,749
Stop being a pain in the ass,
or I'll rip your heart out.

906
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:04,207
Why are you behaving like this?
What's wrong?

907
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:12,290
I can't watch you do this.

908
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:14,374
Can't you just be with me
for a couple of days?

909
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:17,165
What are you saying?

910
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,332
Only two days.
Will you just be with me for two days?

911
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,749
Two days, and then?

912
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:28,249
Then I have to go away.

913
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:30,957
Don't ask, damn it!

914
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:34,124
Are you gonna spend two days
with me, just with me?

915
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,207
Listen.

916
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:44,915
I've lost my mind for you,

917
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,124
and I'll do anything you want,
but tell me the truth.

918
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,832
There's nothing to say.
Nothing!

919
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:54,582
Sure!
Do you think I'm stupid?

920
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,415
You're hiding something.

921
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,624
I've known it since I met you.

922
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:02,290
Sometimes, you're like a crazy man.

923
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:04,332
- Tell me the truth.
- Stop it.

924
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:06,915
I can't tell you anything.

925
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:10,832
Just tell me if you'll be
only with me for two days.

926
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:14,082
You don't trust me?
I love you.

927
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:19,040
It's not that I don't trust you.

928
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:22,624
It's just that the less you know, the better.

929
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,457
Oh, well.
It's the same anyway.

930
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:47,624
Look here.
Do you see this bullet?

931
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:50,624
This "B" and this "M"?

932
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:54,290
Pay attention, Tripolina.
Look at it.

933
01:14:56,083 --> 01:15:02,790
I'm here to put this bullet
in Benito Mussolini's head.

934
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:06,957
My God!
You're an anarchist?

935
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,499
Now, my love,
my life is in your hands.

936
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:23,457
Come on.

937
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:25,499
- Where are you going?
- Let go of me.

938
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:27,790
Wait. Wait a moment.

939
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:33,165
If you wanna get killed by the Fascists,
then leave now. Just go.

940
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:36,790
I'm going back down to work,
to have them abuse me,

941
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:39,040
so I don't think about it anymore.

942
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,165
It was too beautiful.

943
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:45,249
Get out.
Leave me alone.

944
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,790
This is the worst.

945
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:52,999
No. No, it's not the worst.

946
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:58,957
I said the same thing to myself.
But, Tripoli, listen.

947
01:15:59,041 --> 01:16:04,665
Many people will never have two days of love.

948
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:07,624
- Don't throw it away like this.
- Me?

949
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:11,249
You're the one that wants to.
Why? For politics?

950
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,999
What the hell do we care? Why?

951
01:16:16,916 --> 01:16:17,790
Why?

952
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:26,624
Well, because sometimes
someone has to say, "Enough!"

953
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,624
You feel you have to do it.

954
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:33,415
Anyway, I have to do this,
and I'll do it.

955
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,290
Understand?

956
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:40,249
No.

957
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:44,040
I only understand that
when someone is born unfortunate,

958
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:46,749
she remains so.

959
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:53,874
Calm down, baby.

960
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:56,832
Calm down, Curly.

961
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,665
What?

962
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,207
Two days' leave in the middle of all this?

963
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:07,915
Tripolina, you're not a teenager in love.
Do you know that?

964
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,165
Then I'm sorry, Madam.
I'll take my two days and go.

965
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:16,040
You're going?
No problem.

966
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:19,374
But, watch it. If you screw me over
like this, I'll ruin you.

967
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:22,707
You can count on it.

968
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:26,957
You're off the A-list.
So says Madam Aïda.

969
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,957
And for what?

970
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:33,249
For that loser farmer with the freckle-face?

971
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:35,207
Come on, stupid.

972
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:37,165
You don't know men.

973
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,999
They come, fuck and go away.
Come on!

974
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:42,957
And remember, you're under contract.

975
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:47,624
Do the math. These whims of yours
are costing you a lot of money.

976
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:50,374
I've never gotten anything for free
in my whole life.

977
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:54,249
I've seen many end up on the sidewalk for love.

978
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:56,124
It doesn't matter.

979
01:17:56,208 --> 01:18:00,332
Stupid idiot. Loser.
You'll believe anything.

980
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:02,665
Still believe in Santa Claus, eh?

981
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:06,374
Isn't it enough at your age
to be a prostitute in this whorehouse?

982
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:09,540
Madam, the Commendatore isn't feeling well.

983
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:11,540
I was working, and I started caressing him.

984
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:14,415
He's white as a sheet.
He's shaking.

985
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:19,165
Pull! Put him on the bed.

986
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:22,374
Grab hold of him.
Get him up there.

987
01:18:22,458 --> 01:18:25,790
- Shit! He's heavy, poor guy.
- Careful!

988
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:30,249
He's chubby, isn't he?
Damn, he's heavy.

989
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:31,582
Careful, careful.

990
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,207
Shit! Put him on the bed, Maurizia.

991
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,499
- Pull him up!
- Right away.

992
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:39,499
Call Zoraide.
Not a word to anyone!

993
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:40,707
Giuliana!

994
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:42,249
- Who's this Giuliana?
- I dunno.

995
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:46,040
Who's she? His wife.
She died not long ago, poor soul.

996
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:48,790
Otherwise, I'll throw all of you out. Got it?

997
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:51,457
I'll take care of it, Madam.

998
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:54,290
Go get some water.

999
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:56,499
Shit!

1000
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:58,457
The papers.

1001
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:01,540
And, honey, continue with the vinegar massage.

1002
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:06,124
- But, it's disgusting.
- Disgusting?

1003
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,874
If you'd do your job well,
this wouldn't happen.

1004
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:12,999
Poor guy.
He's an old guy who's sick.

1005
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:17,165
Is this everything?
Nothing else in his pockets? Are you sure?

1006
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,665
Poor guy. Is it true
that he lost his wife a year ago?

1007
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,540
Yes, she died last year.

1008
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:25,540
Shit! A good client.

1009
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:28,749
He always came here
just to spend time with us girls.

1010
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:32,749
He said that the smell of youth
made him feel young again.

1011
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:34,332
He's frozen.

1012
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:37,082
He's dying.
We've got to get him out of here.

1013
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:39,665
Can't we ask one of these big shots for help?

1014
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:42,207
The police commissioner's nephew,
the general.

1015
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:44,207
They're all good clients.

1016
01:19:44,291 --> 01:19:48,957
Yes, sure. You find one
that's willing to expose himself for us.

1017
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:50,665
Come on, Nina! Wake up.

1018
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:53,124
We've got to get rid of him.

1019
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:56,749
He can die anywhere but here.
I don't want dead people around. Go!

1020
01:19:56,833 --> 01:20:00,874
- Sure. Like it's easy, right?
- Easy or not, we've got to do it. Period.

1021
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:03,040
I'm here, Madam.
Did you want me?

1022
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:06,707
Zoρaide, come here.
Madam Aïda needs to have a word with you.

1023
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:09,124
Oh, shit. Is he dead?

1024
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:15,124
Listen, Zoraide, does your brother
still have his carriage around here?

1025
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,374
Sure, he has it right down in the alley.

1026
01:20:17,458 --> 01:20:19,665
- Do you need it?
- Bring it here right away.

1027
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:23,374
Look how sweaty he is. Damn it!

1028
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:27,957
He looks better,
but it's safer to take him home.

1029
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:37,915
Well, I don't know Rome that well.

1030
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,415
Where am I supposed to take that guy?

1031
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,457
Right around the corner, near the Forum.

1032
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:46,374
Nobody's around at this hour
in this heat, not even the cats.

1033
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:49,082
It won't make a difference for him, poor guy.
For me, on the other hand —

1034
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:52,957
You can imagine, right?
You're helping me out of a bad jam.

1035
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:56,915
Then, Ninni, if you do me this favor,

1036
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,790
I'll give you Tripolina.

1037
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:05,374
Tripolina is a gold mine for us,
right, Carmela?

1038
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:07,332
You can have her until the day after tomorrow,

1039
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:11,415
meals, lodging and laundry included,
everything free and loving.

1040
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:17,332
And look, I wouldn't do this
even for Benito Mussolini.

1041
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:27,582
Listen, you!
I knew he was crazy, but you?

1042
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:30,915
What is this? While I'm working,
you're busy framing my cousin?

1043
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,999
Carmela! I ordered maximum discretion.

1044
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:37,540
No, who talked?
I didn't say a word!

1045
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:41,165
Sure, everybody's talking downstairs.

1046
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,499
Anyway, Tunin can't do these things!

1047
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:46,207
I didn't know you were his governess.

1048
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:48,415
Anyway, he's an adult.

1049
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:52,915
Besides, if he does me a favor,
I'll do him one.

1050
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,040
Sure!

1051
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:56,915
Bringing him oranges in jail.

1052
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,707
There is no need to talk.
My cousin won't do it.

1053
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:02,207
It's dangerous. Got it, Tunin?

1054
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:04,249
Come on.

1055
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:10,165
With this heat, the lady says
only the cats are around now.

1056
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:13,165
- She said that?
- Isn't it true?

1057
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,124
So?

1058
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:18,457
Sure, and if a cop catches you
carrying a dead man, what will you say?

1059
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:22,082
I said you're not going to do it.
It's dangerous!

1060
01:22:22,166 --> 01:22:24,957
That's enough!

1061
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:28,124
There's no need for a big scene.

1062
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:33,665
I said I'm going,
and that's the end of it.

1063
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,374
- Let's go.
- Wait, Tunin.

1064
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:37,624
Come on. Let's go.

1065
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:40,999
- Don't be a pain!
- If he goes, I go.

1066
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:42,874
Are you crazy?
Carmela's going.

1067
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,624
What do I tell the guys who want Salomè?

1068
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:50,915
Tell them that Salomè's
fallopian tubes shut down.

1069
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,290
- Hurry.
- This way.

1070
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:02,749
- I'll do it.
- Take this.

1071
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:06,124
- Come on. Jump up.
- Let's go.

1072
01:23:10,708 --> 01:23:13,540
- Well, come on. Move!
- Let's go.

1073
01:23:56,958 --> 01:23:58,999
Stay here and whistle if someone comes.

1074
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:00,957
No, I'm coming with you.
He's heavy.

1075
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:03,749
Poor Carmela has varicose veins.

1076
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,790
I prefer to wait here.
I don't feel well.

1077
01:24:09,875 --> 01:24:12,957
- Pull him up.
- Be careful.

1078
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,290
Let's go.

1079
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:20,290
Hurry.

1080
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:41,790
Come on.

1081
01:24:41,875 --> 01:24:44,665
Let's take him behind the column.
It's more private.

1082
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,499
Let's hurry, damn it!

1083
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:49,707
Listen to me.
Stop giving me that look.

1084
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:52,707
If you're angry at me,
it's better if you just tell me.

1085
01:24:52,791 --> 01:24:56,457
Listen. A joke is a joke,
and I like to joke. Life is a bitch.

1086
01:24:56,541 --> 01:24:59,124
If you don't laugh at it,
better to shoot yourself, and that's it.

1087
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:03,207
But for someone like you,
with what you have to do, it's different.

1088
01:25:03,291 --> 01:25:05,832
- I know how I'm supposed to behave!
- No, you don't!

1089
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:08,040
Because I imagined you like a saint,

1090
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:11,915
someone without room for anything except
those who suffered and died for the cause.

1091
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,040
Why? Don't I suffer?
I don't want to die doing this stuff.

1092
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:17,415
Right. Doing this stuff...

1093
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:18,999
- But you fell in love!
- Go to hell!

1094
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:23,124
So take your Tripolina, go to France
and stop thinking about —

1095
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:27,082
- Oh, my Lord!
- Giuliana, forgive me.

1096
01:25:27,166 --> 01:25:29,832
Commendatore, calm down.
Don't get excited, Commendatore.

1097
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:32,082
There. Put him there.

1098
01:25:35,625 --> 01:25:39,540
Come on, Commendatore.
It's nothing.

1099
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:41,290
It's the hot weather.

1100
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:45,540
Come on, Commendatore.
It's nothing.

1101
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:47,790
You feel better now, right?

1102
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:49,082
He's dead.

1103
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,290
Let's go.

1104
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,165
Come on.

1105
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:09,415
Hurry!

1106
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:22,165
- How did it go?
- Good. Nice.

1107
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:25,082
- I had a nice sight-seeing tour.
- I was so scared.

1108
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:28,707
I'm sorry, but I've got to talk to Salomè.

1109
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:32,457
- Wait here.
- But... wait. Tunin!

1110
01:26:48,916 --> 01:26:51,749
What are you doing here?
Go make love to your Tripolina.

1111
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:54,999
After a couple ofdays of gymnastics,
you'll see what a nice steady hand you have.

1112
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:57,874
You won't be able
to even pick up your gun. Go!

1113
01:26:57,958 --> 01:27:00,290
I don't want to talk to you.

1114
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:06,124
Listen, I'll probably die in two days.

1115
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:07,874
I need to stay here.

1116
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:09,540
What's the matter with you?

1117
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:12,207
What the hell is going on?

1118
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:17,249
I can't stay alone in that hotel
anymore, thinking about it.

1119
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:20,290
Look how shaky my hand is.

1120
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:27,290
I'm always thinking about it,
about that moment when I'll have to shoot.

1121
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:31,707
And shit, I feel like I'm dying.
I feel a pain right here.

1122
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:35,957
I'm scared shitless.

1123
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:40,332
That's why I wanted
to take that poor guy there.

1124
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,832
- To see if I could win it over.
- You won, right?

1125
01:27:44,916 --> 01:27:46,832
And now you're not going
to be upset, are you?

1126
01:27:46,916 --> 01:27:48,749
Fear is normal.

1127
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:53,207
The Fascists are not scared
and kill people, but you...

1128
01:27:53,291 --> 01:27:55,124
You're an anarchist.

1129
01:27:56,166 --> 01:27:58,915
Yes, anarchist.

1130
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:02,207
Drop it, okay?

1131
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:05,915
I'm not Michael Sgaravento.

1132
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,249
I'm Antonio Soffiantini, and that's it.

1133
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:11,457
What does that mean?
You're a comrade.

1134
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:15,082
Yes, well...

1135
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:19,124
I'vejust recently become involved in this.

1136
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:28,540
I joined after I saw the police
shoot Michael Sgaravento in the back.

1137
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:31,874
Nothing before.

1138
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:38,124
Antonio Soffiantini
was just a simple farmer. That's it.

1139
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:41,290
One of the flock.

1140
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:43,624
But he...

1141
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:46,957
I mean, I...

1142
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:52,999
Shit, Michael was different!

1143
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:58,374
I'm a joke.

1144
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:03,832
While he, even in that bush,

1145
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:07,832
dead, with his mouth full of mud,

1146
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:10,415
he looked like a king.

1147
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,915
What the fuck?

1148
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,749
What kind of bullshit assassin
did the comrades send me?

1149
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:20,749
Explain yourself!

1150
01:29:20,833 --> 01:29:24,832
Who are you, exactly?
Are you one of the Brighenti group or a loner?

1151
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:27,999
I'm nobody.

1152
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:30,915
I was a friend.

1153
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,957
Michael was like a brother to me.

1154
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:39,790
When he came back,
he confided only in me.

1155
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:45,249
"I came back to kill Mussolini."
That's exactly what he told me.

1156
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,957
He told me everything.

1157
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,749
He left me the suitcase.

1158
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:53,374
He trusted only me.

1159
01:29:54,166 --> 01:30:00,707
He told me, "If something happens to me,
take this to the comrades."

1160
01:30:00,791 --> 01:30:02,374
As if he knew.

1161
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:04,582
So why are you involved then?

1162
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:11,749
I'm involved because,
when I saw him killed like that,

1163
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:15,124
I sold the cow, I took the suitcase,
I went to see Brighenti in Paris,

1164
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:18,499
and I told him that I would
come here to kill Mussolini.

1165
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:22,749
They taught me how to shoot...

1166
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,582
and here I am.

1167
01:30:29,666 --> 01:30:31,499
Listen.

1168
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:35,249
Have you given it some thought?

1169
01:30:35,333 --> 01:30:38,374
Michael was a dedicated anarchist.
He dedicated his life to it.

1170
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:39,915
But you, I mean...

1171
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,999
Maybe at the time you thought
of revenge, but now...

1172
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:47,749
If you don't feel up to it,
you shouldn't do it.

1173
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:51,790
Something like this is a desperate act.
There's no way out.

1174
01:30:53,458 --> 01:30:56,290
Why? Do you think I'll end up like Anteo?

1175
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:59,790
Forget Anteo.

1176
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:03,124
If they arrest you, it's the firing squad.
Or worse, the Saint Anthony.

1177
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:06,707
Saint Anthony?

1178
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:10,124
They'll beat you to death,
and no one will know a thing.

1179
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:15,999
What do you want to do?
Scare me?

1180
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:18,040
You're wasting your time,

1181
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:21,207
because I'm already so scared

1182
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:23,874
that you can't even imagine.

1183
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:30,540
But I have to do this.

1184
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:34,707
Even if I'm not an anarchist now,
maybe they'll make me one later.

1185
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:38,332
Look, I promised myself
I wouldn't go back to that slave life.

1186
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:41,374
Day after day, only to die like a dog.

1187
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:43,415
I can't do it anymore.

1188
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:47,249
A farm rat lives better than us.

1189
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:49,707
I promised myself
to never again crawl around in shit.

1190
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:55,082
This action is what I need
to feel like a man.

1191
01:31:57,291 --> 01:31:59,582
Maybe now you don't trust me.

1192
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,332
No, it's not about trust.

1193
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:06,374
It's this war we're fighting.

1194
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:08,665
You don't even know why you're doing it.

1195
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:11,749
You're the one to be sacrificed,
and you're not involved at all.

1196
01:32:12,458 --> 01:32:16,290
Once I've killed Mussolini,
I'll be involved, right?

1197
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:21,249
Yes.

1198
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:26,332
Enough now.
It'll be okay.

1199
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:28,165
Go to that girl now.

1200
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:31,374
She's waiting behind the door for you,
dying with anxiety.

1201
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:36,499
When she looks at you,
you can see little stars falling from her eyes.

1202
01:32:36,583 --> 01:32:40,415
Poor Tripoli.
Life has already been so bad to her.

1203
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:41,999
Go now.

1204
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:07,040
Good morning.
This is really funny.

1205
01:36:07,125 --> 01:36:10,957
I knew the cousin lost it for you.

1206
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:14,540
Did you know the other night this jerk
almost smashed a bottle on my head?

1207
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:17,165
I didn't break him
because I felt bad for him.

1208
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:18,915
He was drunk as hell.

1209
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,499
Well, well, Tripolina, who knows?

1210
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:25,457
Maybe you found the jerk
who's going to marry you.

1211
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,457
Best wishes for male children.

1212
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:32,957
Pardon.

1213
01:37:48,708 --> 01:37:51,207
These, Tunin, are our passports.

1214
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:53,082
The comrades delivered them.

1215
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:56,124
It's better to cross the border legally
as emigrants than illegally.

1216
01:37:56,208 --> 01:38:00,332
Because if everything goes well
and Mussolini dies,

1217
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:03,874
you know how many problems we'll have
with those jerks at the border.

1218
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:05,040
Right.

1219
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:08,707
If everything goes well, then we'll see.

1220
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:14,165
I'll wake you up at 6:00.
Everything will be okay. You'll see.

1221
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,749
Put this stuff away now.

1222
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:34,082
Don't make this kitty wait for you.

1223
01:38:34,166 --> 01:38:36,290
Isn't love beautiful?

1224
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:39,499
But it sure is headed
in one hell of a direction.

1225
01:39:46,791 --> 01:39:49,374
I'm sorry, honey,

1226
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:53,207
but I've got to sleep, at least a little.

1227
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:54,832
Love.

1228
01:39:54,916 --> 01:39:56,790
My love.

1229
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,915
Hey, girl.

1230
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,249
You're always crying, you know?

1231
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:13,207
Listen.

1232
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:14,957
Come here.

1233
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:18,707
Don't do this.

1234
01:40:18,791 --> 01:40:21,457
You're making it worse.

1235
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:27,790
So, Curly.

1236
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:29,999
Tell me.

1237
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:33,749
Damn, it was beautiful, wasn't it?

1238
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:37,832
The two of us alone,

1239
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:41,499
like a honeymoon.

1240
01:40:42,041 --> 01:40:43,915
Two days only for us.

1241
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,707
They flew by.

1242
01:40:49,791 --> 01:40:51,665
And now?

1243
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:58,290
Now we've got to sleep, and that's all.

1244
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:03,374
And she's crying again.

1245
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:11,499
Listen, Curly.

1246
01:41:11,583 --> 01:41:13,290
Listen to me.

1247
01:41:14,125 --> 01:41:18,332
I want to tell you something.

1248
01:41:23,041 --> 01:41:25,249
You're the best thing...

1249
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:30,040
that's happened in my life.

1250
01:44:59,208 --> 01:45:01,582
What are you doing up?
Is he up already?

1251
01:45:01,666 --> 01:45:03,165
We must wake him.

1252
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:06,540
- No, you will not wake him up.
- Are you crazy?

1253
01:45:06,625 --> 01:45:09,290
- Come. I need to talk to you.
- Don't be stupid! It's late already.

1254
01:45:09,375 --> 01:45:14,374
If you wake him up,
I'm going to report you and him.

1255
01:45:14,458 --> 01:45:17,749
Let's go.
Let's talk in the bathroom.

1256
01:45:24,833 --> 01:45:26,624
Okay.

1257
01:45:26,708 --> 01:45:30,290
- And now?
- Now, you will not wake him.

1258
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:33,165
He's sound asleep,
and when he wakes, it must be too late.

1259
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:37,374
Listen, little girl. Get out of the way.
You were never involved to begin with.

1260
01:45:37,458 --> 01:45:39,790
This is not a teenage romance.
Give me the key.

1261
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:40,832
No!

1262
01:45:40,916 --> 01:45:44,415
I know it's the cause and all the rest.

1263
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,332
But you're not waking him up!

1264
01:45:46,416 --> 01:45:50,040
Because no cause is worth
a poor, young guy having to die like a dog.

1265
01:45:50,125 --> 01:45:53,499
- Because you know he'll die like a dog.
- Of course he'll die like a dog.

1266
01:45:53,583 --> 01:45:56,415
Like all the others even younger than him,

1267
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,457
more innocent than him.

1268
01:45:58,541 --> 01:46:00,082
I saw them with my own two eyes.

1269
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:01,999
He knows it too, but he doesn't care,

1270
01:46:02,083 --> 01:46:05,540
because he'd rather die like a dog
than live like a dog.

1271
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:08,957
But only after he does what he has to do.
Yes, you die for these things!

1272
01:46:09,041 --> 01:46:10,999
All of us are ready to die for this dream!

1273
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:14,124
Get out of the way!
You cannot understand.

1274
01:46:14,208 --> 01:46:15,749
- And give me the key!
- Damn you!

1275
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:18,082
Give me the key!

1276
01:46:24,125 --> 01:46:26,124
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1277
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:29,790
Watch it! I'll smash your—

1278
01:46:34,875 --> 01:46:38,249
You're not going to wake him!
I'll kill you!

1279
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:41,290
You're completely insane!

1280
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,332
I'll kill you!
Yes, I'll kill you!

1281
01:46:45,416 --> 01:46:47,207
And then I'll kill myself.

1282
01:46:47,291 --> 01:46:49,499
I don't give a shit about living anymore.

1283
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:54,290
You've got a black heart.
You don't care about that poor creature.

1284
01:46:54,916 --> 01:46:57,874
He's got that nice cause.

1285
01:46:57,958 --> 01:46:59,790
Sure, it's the cause.

1286
01:46:59,875 --> 01:47:03,290
Maybe one day it'll happen,
and what if it doesn't?

1287
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:06,665
But he's got to die this morning.

1288
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:09,374
If you wake him up,
you're killing him!

1289
01:47:09,458 --> 01:47:13,707
- With those dirty hands!
- Shut up, you idiot! Don't scream.

1290
01:47:13,791 --> 01:47:16,707
Do you think you're doing him a favor?
It's his decision.

1291
01:47:16,791 --> 01:47:18,707
- When he wakes up, he'll hate you.
- I know.

1292
01:47:18,791 --> 01:47:22,207
He won't see me anymore.
He'll leave full of hatred but alive.

1293
01:47:22,291 --> 01:47:25,957
- That's enough for me.
- Not for me. I can't.

1294
01:47:26,041 --> 01:47:27,915
That pig has to die.

1295
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,374
I made a promise to a dead boy
that trusted me.

1296
01:47:30,458 --> 01:47:33,207
The comrades trust me.
<i>He</i> trusts me.

1297
01:47:33,291 --> 01:47:35,207
I can't listen to you.
I don't want to!

1298
01:47:35,291 --> 01:47:36,874
You must listen.

1299
01:47:36,958 --> 01:47:38,874
Because you have another reason.

1300
01:47:38,958 --> 01:47:41,457
- You're jealous.
- Up yours!

1301
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:43,665
- You're jealous.
- You idiot!

1302
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,790
I beg you to help me save him.

1303
01:47:45,875 --> 01:47:48,790
- I know you care about him.
- Of course!

1304
01:47:48,875 --> 01:47:51,582
Of course I care about that boy.

1305
01:47:51,666 --> 01:47:53,040
Poor guy.

1306
01:47:53,125 --> 01:47:57,374
He just fell into this political mess
like a fly into a glass.

1307
01:47:57,458 --> 01:48:00,999
It's even worse than Anteo.
He's so young that my heart breaks.

1308
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:03,832
I would go if I knew how to shoot.

1309
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:06,040
Too late!

1310
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:08,540
I can't afford these fucking feelings.

1311
01:48:08,625 --> 01:48:11,332
Feelings are a luxury, and this is war!

1312
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:16,040
What would happen if all women stopped
their soldiers at the door during war?

1313
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:17,707
You die in war.

1314
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:19,999
It would be great if every mother did that.

1315
01:48:20,083 --> 01:48:22,540
Why not? Why?

1316
01:48:22,625 --> 01:48:25,374
For history?
For justice?

1317
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:28,165
They've been fighting
since the creation of the world.

1318
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:31,290
Explain it to me, all this justice.

1319
01:48:31,375 --> 01:48:35,165
The dead stay dead, and that's it.

1320
01:48:39,333 --> 01:48:42,415
Damn you, and damn me.

1321
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:46,624
Fucking sentimental whores that we are.

1322
01:48:48,916 --> 01:48:52,207
Open up the door.
I can't stand this bullshit any longer.

1323
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:54,790
I disgust myself. Go away.

1324
01:48:55,625 --> 01:48:57,415
They're right.

1325
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:59,915
Never trust a whore.

1326
01:50:05,708 --> 01:50:08,332
Why didn't you wake me?
Why didn't you wake me?

1327
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:10,790
Why didn't you wake me?

1328
01:50:10,875 --> 01:50:13,290
Fucking traitor!

1329
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:15,665
It's 1 0:00! I'm ruined!

1330
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:18,624
Why didn't you wake me up?

1331
01:50:20,458 --> 01:50:23,540
And you,
you fucking treacherous whore,

1332
01:50:23,625 --> 01:50:25,957
why didn't you call me? Why?

1333
01:50:26,041 --> 01:50:29,207
Because right now you'd be dead,
with a bullet in your chest.

1334
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:32,040
I'm worse than dead now.

1335
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:36,374
Like a worm sleeping in a whore's bed.

1336
01:50:36,458 --> 01:50:40,332
That's what you are to me, whores!

1337
01:50:40,416 --> 01:50:42,832
What am I going to do now?

1338
01:50:42,916 --> 01:50:45,290
I'll kill myself. I'll do it.

1339
01:50:45,958 --> 01:50:48,874
Where's my gun?
Where did I put it?

1340
01:50:48,958 --> 01:50:51,290
- Where is it?
- Wait, Tunin. Stop!

1341
01:50:51,375 --> 01:50:53,665
I'm going to put that bullet
in my forehead anyway.

1342
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:55,665
- Stop it!
- Fucking whores.

1343
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:58,082
Get away from me, whore!

1344
01:50:58,166 --> 01:50:59,832
Go away!

1345
01:50:59,916 --> 01:51:03,457
Stop crying!
We've got to stop him.

1346
01:51:03,541 --> 01:51:05,957
I'm gonna shoot myself in the head!

1347
01:51:08,125 --> 01:51:09,249
Let go of me!

1348
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:14,415
Give me that pistol!

1349
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,457
Give me that pistol!

1350
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:23,665
Shut up.

1351
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:26,457
Please shut up.
You're gonna ruin everything. Shut up!

1352
01:51:26,541 --> 01:51:29,707
Coming. Stop it.
What the hell do you want?

1353
01:51:29,791 --> 01:51:31,040
Salomè!

1354
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:34,374
Can't we even have
a private family argument, damn it?

1355
01:51:34,458 --> 01:51:38,374
Fucking whores. Everybody behind the door
shrieking like a bunch of hens.

1356
01:51:38,458 --> 01:51:40,582
Mind your own business! Got it?

1357
01:51:40,666 --> 01:51:45,207
That has nothing to do with it. You know
I don't allow people to make a scene in here.

1358
01:51:45,291 --> 01:51:48,374
- What do I care?
- It sounded like you were killing each other.

1359
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:51,082
You, shut up!
Look who's talking.

1360
01:51:51,166 --> 01:51:55,915
The other day, this one and the Spanish girl
screamed like hell over a pair of underwear.

1361
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,374
Get a life!

1362
01:51:58,958 --> 01:52:00,624
What's wrong?

1363
01:52:11,416 --> 01:52:14,207
Oh, shit.
They're coming for me.

1364
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:16,415
- Calm down.
- They're going to arrest me, arrest me.

1365
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,249
Stay calm.

1366
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:22,290
What am I going to do now?
They're here for me.

1367
01:52:22,375 --> 01:52:24,874
You betrayed me.

1368
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:27,749
Stop with this bullshit.
Nobody betrayed you. You know it.

1369
01:52:27,833 --> 01:52:30,915
- Calm down.
- I can't end up like this.

1370
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,624
They're coming.
I knew it. They betrayed me.

1371
01:52:33,708 --> 01:52:35,457
What the hell have you done to me?

1372
01:52:35,541 --> 01:52:38,332
- Love!
- Fuck! I feel sick.

1373
01:52:38,416 --> 01:52:41,374
I'm scared shitless.

1374
01:52:41,458 --> 01:52:43,707
Listen. Nobody here betrayed you.
You know it.

1375
01:52:43,791 --> 01:52:47,249
We did it only to save you and for love.

1376
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:50,290
I love you two also.

1377
01:52:50,375 --> 01:52:52,832
Don't leave me.
Don't abandon me.

1378
01:52:52,916 --> 01:52:56,499
Enough!
For Christ's sake, Tunin!

1379
01:52:56,583 --> 01:53:00,332
I'm going down to delay them.
You and Tripolina can escape out the back.

1380
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,957
She's got some money,
and you can take mine too.

1381
01:53:03,041 --> 01:53:05,040
It's in the bottom drawer.
The gun's there.

1382
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:07,290
You'll make it. You'll see.

1383
01:53:07,375 --> 01:53:11,957
Go back to Paris, to Saverio Brighenti.
Listen to me! Saverio Brighenti!

1384
01:53:13,791 --> 01:53:17,540
Mother, please don't leave me.
My mother!

1385
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:19,540
Tunin, enough!

1386
01:53:19,625 --> 01:53:21,957
Don't waste time!
And don't be upset with yourself.

1387
01:53:22,041 --> 01:53:25,457
Not everyone has to be a hero, damn it!

1388
01:53:28,458 --> 01:53:33,624
Come on, Tunin. Here's the money,
the passports and the gun.

1389
01:53:33,708 --> 01:53:35,915
Oh, dear God!

1390
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,999
What are you doing?
Come on, honey. I'll help you.

1391
01:53:39,083 --> 01:53:41,165
Why are you acting like this?

1392
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:44,582
Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

1393
01:53:46,083 --> 01:53:48,290
We're going to make it.

1394
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,290
- No, baby.
- I love you. Calm down.

1395
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:59,374
I'm going to calm down now, you'll see.

1396
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:02,290
You'll see how calm I'm going to be.

1397
01:54:12,458 --> 01:54:14,290
No!

1398
01:54:16,375 --> 01:54:18,957
What are you doing?
Let's go! Let's run away.

1399
01:54:19,041 --> 01:54:22,249
No, I'm not running away anymore.

1400
01:54:22,333 --> 01:54:24,540
Go away!

1401
01:54:24,625 --> 01:54:28,124
- Tunin!
- It's over.

1402
01:54:29,375 --> 01:54:30,749
It's all over.

1403
01:54:33,041 --> 01:54:35,415
I won't run away!

1404
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:40,749
The medical checkup
is on Thursday, my dear Marshal.

1405
01:54:40,833 --> 01:54:44,624
In any case, the girls are in order.
They're up in their rooms.

1406
01:54:44,708 --> 01:54:48,207
You're at home here. If you want to come in,
you know the way, right?

1407
01:54:48,291 --> 01:54:50,624
Yes, ma'am. I know the way.

1408
01:54:51,333 --> 01:54:53,290
-Jesus!
- Who's that?

1409
01:54:54,125 --> 01:54:55,832
I wanted to kill Mussolini!

1410
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:07,499
Stop!

1411
01:55:08,458 --> 01:55:11,249
What are you doing, Tunin?

1412
01:55:18,333 --> 01:55:20,374
Run, Tunin!

1413
01:55:20,458 --> 01:55:23,124
Tunin!
Run away, Tunin!

1414
01:55:25,458 --> 01:55:26,790
Long live anarchy!

1415
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:36,665
No, Jesus, no!

1416
01:56:14,291 --> 01:56:15,624
Tunin, run!

1417
01:56:31,291 --> 01:56:32,790
Tunin, shut up!

1418
01:56:32,875 --> 01:56:35,957
Don't say anything! There's no use!

1419
01:56:36,041 --> 01:56:37,332
Stop it!

1420
01:56:37,416 --> 01:56:38,665
Stop that car!

1421
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:43,165
Not like this.
Not like Anteo!

1422
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,707
I wanted to kill Mussolini
for all of you comrades,

1423
01:56:49,791 --> 01:56:54,040
equal and free like nature created us.

1424
01:56:54,125 --> 01:56:57,749
- Stop him! He's an anarchist!
- I wanted to kill Mussolini!

1425
01:57:01,958 --> 01:57:04,165
Not like Anteo!

1426
01:57:04,708 --> 01:57:07,249
Just like Anteo! Not you too!

1427
01:57:07,333 --> 01:57:10,624
Shut those whores up!

1428
01:57:11,375 --> 01:57:12,957
My love!

1429
01:57:14,458 --> 01:57:18,290
Tunin, my love! Tunin!

1430
01:57:23,833 --> 01:57:25,207
Help!

1431
01:57:25,291 --> 01:57:27,874
Stop! Do something.

1432
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:30,707
He was doing it for you, you bastards.

1433
01:57:30,791 --> 01:57:32,874
He did it for you!

1434
01:57:32,958 --> 01:57:36,249
You're all slaves,
and you don't even know it!

1435
01:57:36,333 --> 01:57:39,040
Bourgeois sheep!

1436
01:57:39,125 --> 01:57:42,749
He was a poor guy with a big heart.

1437
01:57:42,833 --> 01:57:45,499
He was better than all of you, you bastards!

1438
01:57:55,791 --> 01:57:58,290
Enough. That's enough.
Excuse me, Captain.

1439
01:57:58,375 --> 01:58:00,832
Pull him up properly in the chair, like that.

1440
01:58:00,916 --> 01:58:04,207
Here, honey. Have a cigarette.

1441
01:58:04,833 --> 01:58:06,999
So, Professor Soffiantini,

1442
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:09,749
your jail is going to be
30 feet under the sea.

1443
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:11,374
Air comes in through a little pipe.

1444
01:58:11,458 --> 01:58:13,790
Little air and no light.
Complete darkness.

1445
01:58:13,875 --> 01:58:17,957
They lock you up, and you stay there
in the silence. Nobody says a word to you.

1446
01:58:18,041 --> 01:58:20,707
Sooner or later, you go crazy.

1447
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:23,457
Passannante was found eating his own shit.

1448
01:58:23,541 --> 01:58:27,207
He had turned green, flabby and bald.
He looked like a worm.

1449
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:30,499
But give me a few names and addresses,
and I'll consider the mental illness excuse.

1450
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:34,124
I give you my word.
Maybe 1 0 years, and you're free.

1451
01:58:34,208 --> 01:58:36,790
Who sent you?
Are you part of Brighenti's gang?

1452
01:58:36,875 --> 01:58:38,874
Tell me.
Are you with Brighenti's gang?

1453
01:58:38,958 --> 01:58:42,457
Are you from Paris?
From America? Who sent you?

1454
01:58:42,541 --> 01:58:47,124
You don't think I'd believe you came
to Rome alone to kill Benito Mussolini?

1455
01:58:47,208 --> 01:58:49,457
- Who sent you?
- Love live anarchy.

1456
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:52,165
What'd you say?

1457
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:56,124
I don't know anything about anybody.
Shoot me. I want you to.

1458
01:58:56,208 --> 01:58:59,624
Fucking anarchist!

1459
01:58:59,708 --> 01:59:01,790
I'll teach you!

1460
01:59:01,875 --> 01:59:05,707
"Love live anarchy!" Shit!

1461
01:59:06,375 --> 01:59:08,374
Away! Take him away!

1462
01:59:08,458 --> 01:59:10,665
Rough him up nice and good.

1463
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:12,957
Because he's got to talk.

1464
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:15,374
Hello? Captain Fautasso.

1465
01:59:15,458 --> 01:59:17,582
Yes, Your Excellency.

1466
01:59:18,083 --> 01:59:20,457
Yes, Your Excellency.
Of course.

1467
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:23,124
Don't you worry.

1468
01:59:23,208 --> 01:59:25,415
Good-bye, Your Excellency.

1469
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,915
They don't want it known.
He prefers it.

1470
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,749
The number of these crazies
has tripled lately, huh?

1471
01:59:30,833 --> 01:59:34,499
What are you saying, Captain?
The Italians love their Duce.

1472
01:59:34,583 --> 01:59:36,290
Besides...

1473
01:59:37,791 --> 01:59:39,332
there's been no negative talk for years now.

1474
01:59:39,416 --> 01:59:42,540
Then again, instead of killing them
like they deserve, he pardons them.

1475
01:59:42,625 --> 01:59:45,540
Oh, my poor child.
What are you talking about, Commander?

1476
01:59:45,625 --> 01:59:49,082
He pardons them! What pardon?
Who got a pardon?

1477
01:59:49,166 --> 01:59:52,457
He pardoned those two we know about,
but what about the others?

1478
01:59:52,541 --> 01:59:54,874
He's a hero, but he's not stupid.

1479
01:59:54,958 --> 01:59:58,332
It's better to make some people
disappear without publicity.

1480
01:59:58,416 --> 02:00:00,749
And this is one more case like that.

1481
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:04,540
It's faster. More political, right?

1482
02:00:04,625 --> 02:00:06,665
Damn it!

1483
02:00:07,458 --> 02:00:08,665
Go ahead.

1484
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:13,290
This morning at 1 0:00 in Via dei Fiori,

1485
02:00:16,458 --> 02:00:19,999
in the well-known whorehouse,

1486
02:00:20,958 --> 02:00:24,832
an unknown man,

1487
02:00:26,666 --> 02:00:31,124
overcome by a fit of madness,

1488
02:00:32,583 --> 02:00:36,249
fired some shots at a police unit

1489
02:00:40,375 --> 02:00:43,874
during a routine inspection.

1490
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:46,499
Once arrested,

1491
02:00:47,125 --> 02:00:49,749
the unknown man took his own life

1492
02:00:50,708 --> 02:00:54,082
by violently beating his head

1493
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:01,040
against the wall of his cell.

1494
02:01:12,541 --> 02:01:14,499
Mother!

1495
02:02:02,625 --> 02:02:05,290
I wish to repeat my horror at attacks,

1496
02:02:05,375 --> 02:02:09,540
which besides being bad
in and of themselves are also stupid,

1497
02:02:09,625 --> 02:02:13,707
because they harm the very cause
they are trying to serve...

1498
02:02:13,791 --> 02:02:17,207
But those assassins are also saints and heroes...

1499
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:21,707
And they will be celebrated
once the brutal facts are forgotten,

1500
02:02:21,791 --> 02:02:25,665
and all that is remembered
is the idea that inspired them

1501
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:28,499
and the martyrdom that made them saints.
- Errico Malatesta

1502
02:02:40,458 --> 02:02:43,457
LOVE AND ANARCHY

1503
02:02:43,541 --> 02:02:45,540
Or

1504
02:02:45,625 --> 02:02:50,624
"This morning at 10:00 in Via dei Fiori,
in the well-known whorehouse..."
