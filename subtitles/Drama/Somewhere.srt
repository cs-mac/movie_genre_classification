1
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,220
- Sammy, you're coming?
- Where's that little midget waiter dude?

2
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,013
- What?
- The little midget waiter.

3
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,934
- Oh, shit!
- That was funny.

4
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,560
You always trip like that.

5
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,853
Fuck.

6
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,877
Hey, Johnny, doing okay?

7
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,170
Great. Thanks.

8
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,509
I think he is.

9
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,096
He's cute.

10
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,902
That was great.

11
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,871
Come here, Bambi.

12
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,748
I'm Cindy, you moron.

13
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,374
I'm sorry, Cindy.

14
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,918
I'm the other one.

15
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:49,991
Hmm.

16
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,203
Hi, Dad.

17
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,622
Hey, Cleo.

18
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:01,920
Hi, Johnny.

19
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,506
Hey, Layla.

20
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,093
What happened to you?

21
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,470
Ah, just a little stunt work.

22
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,723
You know, I do all my own stunts.

23
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,063
Don't get her back too late, okay?

24
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,606
Yeah, sure.

25
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,237
I like this, my first signature.

26
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,239
- Thanks.
- This is cool.

27
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,125
- You see that?
- What?

28
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,087
The black SUV behind us.
I think he's following us.

29
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,590
Does he have any cameras?

30
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,759
It just looks like a car.

31
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,933
Watch your line. Step back.

32
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,228
And remember to keep yourself square, okay?

33
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,521
Play the music.

34
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,915
You're really good.

35
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,875
Thanks.

36
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,294
When did you learn how to ice skate?

37
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,838
I've been going for three years.

38
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,050
Really?

39
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,389
Is that the same SUV?

40
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,184
There's kind of a lot of those in LA.

41
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,062
Yeah, but I think that's the same one.
I've seen it.

42
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,989
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking down the plates.

43
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,574
Nice. Good thinking.

44
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,955
- Bye, kiddo.
- Bye.

45
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,211
Got it?

46
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,661
Hi.

47
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,414
Hey, Johnny, we're having a party.

48
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,875
- Yeah, it looks great.
- Thanks.

49
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,755
Hey, man, how are ya?

50
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,384
- Cheers.
- Johnny.

51
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:10,056
There's this documentary, it's amazing.
it's called The F Word.

52
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,851
People saying "fuck" on TV in America.
It was this video and stuff.

53
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:19,607
And it's about $200,000 fine in the US
if you say it on TV.

54
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,361
Thanks.

55
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,446
Cool.

56
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,875
Yeah. So how many times do you go?

57
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,252
MAN 22 You like it, I like it.

58
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,546
I love you. Oh, I really love you.

59
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,632
They've to go straight for door number two.

60
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,598
Hi.

61
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:34,932
Hi.

62
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,230
Oh, hey. Hey, Johnny. I'm sorry.

63
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,440
Sorry.

64
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:46,110
Hey, I don't want to bother you.
I just wanted to...

65
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:49,405
I'm an actor and I just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

66
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,741
- Spitball and stuff, you know.
- Yeah. Go for it.

67
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:55,286
Um...
So, did you study formally?

68
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,913
Study? No, I didn't really.

69
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,748
No? Really? Really?

70
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,751
So you don't do, like, method and stuff,
or anything like that?

71
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,169
Method acting?

72
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,213
- Yeah. You know, like...
- I don't really follow...

73
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,090
I don't really follow
a particular method or anything.

74
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:12,094
I just, really, I started and I got an agent
and auditioned and stuff.

75
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,262
Yeah. Cool.

76
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,597
- But stick with it, all right?
- Yeah.

77
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,890
- You can do it, man.
- Okay.

78
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,600
- All right, homie.
- Thank you.

79
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,441
Hi. I'm Johnny.

80
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,653
Hi, Johnny.

81
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,952
Ah, come here. Come here.

82
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:38,704
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

83
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,748
Johnny.

84
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,546
Oh, my cast is stuck.

85
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:47,922
Kiss me, kiss me.

86
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,134
- You're a good kisser, Johnny.
- Yeah?

87
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,263
Oh, boy!

88
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,267
Kiss me, please.

89
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:06,190
- Oh, Johnny.
- Oh, my God. That's...

90
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,486
Oh, yeah.

91
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,238
It tickles.

92
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,492
Where are your panties? Oh, here they are.

93
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,660
Okay.

94
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,079
Okay.

95
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,956
Oh, boy.

96
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,385
Johnny.

97
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,056
Johnny?

98
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,853
Johnny?

99
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,996
- Hello.
Good morning, Johnny.

100
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,206
Oh, hey, Marge.

101
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,957
Your car's waiting downstairs.

102
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,125
For what?

103
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,419
The junket at the Four Seasons.

104
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,505
Oh, right.

105
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,801
Claire will meet you in the lobby
to take you up when you get there.

106
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,428
Okay, I need, like, five minutes.
Give me a second.

107
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,895
Hi, Johnny. How are you?
You look amazing. Oh, my gosh.

108
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,189
Hey, Johnny, Paul Metcalf. Universal.
Thanks for coming.

109
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,149
- Hi, I'm Jane Amrow from Universal.
- Hi.

110
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,569
Great, great. Okay, we're going to go upstairs
for a photo with Rebecca.

111
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:16,737
Okay.

112
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,656
Okay. Then we're going to go down
for a press conference.

113
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,367
I'll be right there.
If you don't know the answer, I do.

114
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,494
Do you want something to drink?
We're going to go this way.

115
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,830
- I'm good right now.
- Coffee or water?

116
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,999
Rebecca, Johnny, can you just move
a little bit closer together there?

117
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,209
- Sure.
- Put your arm around...

118
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,502
That's great.

119
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,379
Big smile.

120
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,382
That's it, straight to camera.

121
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,219
Let's check those.

122
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,181
- You look great.
- Thanks.

123
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,350
I was being sarcastic.

124
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,311
You good?

125
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,063
Yeah, good to go.
- Okay.

126
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,691
And big smiles.

127
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,485
Can I get you to look towards each other
and smile?

128
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,572
That's it. That's it. And back to camera.

129
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,077
That's it. Great. Let me just test these.

130
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,370
Is that it?

131
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,293
PHOTOGRAPHERS And...

132
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,794
Big smiles.

133
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,842
And we're good. Thank you.

134
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,594
It wasn't even that good.

135
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,229
- So are we good?
- Yeah.

136
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,857
That was awesome!

137
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,942
Okay, ready for the press conference?

138
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,319
- Yes. Great.
- You're gonna follow me.

139
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,653
Do you need anything to drink?

140
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:41,822
- Are you okay till we get there? Okay.
No, I'm great.

141
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,244
I'm just going to be right over here.

142
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,080
MALE REPORTER II Johnny.
FEMALE REPORTER III Hi, Johnny.

143
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,249
Hi, everybody.

144
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,419
How do you think
this role represents Italian-Americans?

145
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,879
She always goes first.

146
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,507
Would you like to go to China?

147
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,800
Yes.

148
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,802
You have many fans there.

149
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,472
Hi, Johnny. You're always in good shape.

150
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,516
Can you share your workout secrets with us?

151
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,185
I'm asking because I'm writing my next book
for Russia

152
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,312
on workout secrets of Hollywood stars.

153
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,605
Oh.

154
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,690
Just basics.

155
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:22,863
This film has a
reflection of today's post-modern globalism?

156
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,451
I'm sorry, what was the question again?

157
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,620
Who's Cleo on your cast?

158
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,372
Cleo's my daughter.

159
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,875
Who is Johnny Marco?

160
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,711
Um...

161
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,987
Hey, man, can you take a right on Fountain?
I want to make a quick stop.

162
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,405
Sure.
- Thanks.

163
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,956
Great, man. I'll be back in a minute.

164
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,374
Okay.

165
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,134
I

166
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,456
Thanks, man.
You got it.

167
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,707
All right.

168
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,776
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

169
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,744
What room you in?

170
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,079
59.

171
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,667
I met Bono in 59.

172
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,378
oh, yeah?

173
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,838
That's cool.

174
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,138
- See you, man.
- Stay loose.

175
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,812
- Yeah.
Morning, Johnny.

176
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,439
Hey, Marge.

177
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,441
They're waiting for you
at the special effects studio.

178
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,151
They need to do a mould of your head.

179
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,820
The map should be under your door, okay?

180
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,489
Yep, okay.

181
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,287
<GROANS>

182
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,174
All right, so, Johnny,
what we're gonna need you to do here...

183
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,427
You're slouching a little bit.
We'll need you to sit up a little more.

184
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:56,595
Oh, yeah. Oh, sure.

185
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:00,390
Now the most important thing to do
is to remain rigidly upright

186
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:02,226
during this entire process.

187
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,812
- Like this?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

188
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,611
Good in the front for you or...

189
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,404
Uh, I can be.

190
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,244
On the left side,
let's pull this back just a little over here.

191
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:22,371
Close your eyes.

192
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,749
Now I'm going to have you
keep your eyes closed

193
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:29,419
and your mouth closed
for the rest of this process, okay?

194
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:30,629
Yep.

195
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,382
And this shouldn't take longer
than 40 minutes or so.

196
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,551
Oh!

197
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,053
- Yeah, it's cold, isn't it?
- Hmm.

198
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,727
All right.

199
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,708
All right, let's get the, uh...

200
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,626
Let's get the bandages ready.

201
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,171
All right.

202
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,637
All right.

203
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,275
Okay, Johnny,
we're just about done.

204
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,194
Let me show you how you look.

205
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:07,577
Jesus.

206
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:23,844
Hello?

207
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:27,931
Good evening, Mr. Marco.
Your masseur is here. Shall we send him up?

208
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,517
Him? Okay.

209
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,618
Hey.

210
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,038
- Where's Lori?
Oh, they didn't tell you?

211
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:52,706
She wasn't available.

212
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,916
No. Come on in.

213
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,871
Whoa!

214
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:20,043
- What the fuck, dude?
- Oh, did they not tell you how I work?

215
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,545
No.

216
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,713
You see, I have a website
that explains my technique.

217
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,924
I feel that if my client's naked,

218
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,635
it's just more comfortable
if I meet them at the same level.

219
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,179
Yeah, it's not for me.

220
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,015
Thanks, though.
Why don't you just pack it up?

221
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,434
All right.

222
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,944
Sir, I'm sorry about that.

223
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,529
No, it's cool.

224
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:59,458
Gandhi advocated the boycott
of machine made European clothing.

225
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:03,044
And it caused large scale unemployment
in India.

226
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:07,799
As always Gandhi wore
only white linen cloth,

227
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,636
which had become a symbol
of the entire movement.

228
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,974
He took to making a handmade cloth
called khadi.

229
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:21,146
Most importantly,
it showed India how to be self-reliant.

230
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,172
Hi.

231
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,174
You got another cigarette?

232
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,551
Yeah, sure.

233
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,394
Hi.

234
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,532
Oh, Shania...

235
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,784
Shannon.
Shannon. Sorry.

236
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,914
- Hey, Cleo.
- Hey.

237
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,461
Why are you taking a bath next door?
Is yours broken?

238
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,839
Yeah. Yeah, it's been acting weird.

239
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:32,217
What a nice surprise.

240
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,056
Come on in. You got your stuff?

241
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,018
Shouldn't you be in school today?

242
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,353
it's Sunday.

243
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,443
You need to hold down the...
The rhythm.

244
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,445
Yeah.
Yeah!

245
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,033
Here we go.

246
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,054
Here we go.

247
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,479
- Are you using your whammy?
- Yup.

248
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,578
Drummers is what you do now.

249
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:43,913
Why don't you use drummers?

250
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,666
It's not Stewart Copeland?

251
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,045
Well, it wasn't that hot pretty girl.

252
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:51,671
Big lips.

253
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:56,176
Let's see what the score was.
Let's see the score.

254
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,970
Oh, God. Jeez.

255
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,973
-97!
-97! Whoa.

256
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:03,642
-92.
-92.

257
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,185
- I beat you?
- Yeah.

258
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,027
Stick to movies!

259
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,737
Are you kidding me?

260
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,448
Another actor's failed transition into music.

261
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,242
Oh, God!

262
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,161
Cleo, check this out.

263
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,831
You don't do any sports, you just do ballet?

264
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,124
Mmm-hmm.

265
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,335
Ice skating.

266
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,379
And jazz dance, huh?

267
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:34,005
No.

268
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,425
My sister did jazz dance.

269
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,761
It was so stupid. I always had to watch her.

270
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,809
Oh, God, and her stupid leotard.

271
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,104
- Like this? Like...
- Yeah, she looked like...

272
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,443
What else do you do, do you do karate?

273
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,028
No.

274
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:02,242
At ballet, are you the best in the class?

275
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,829
I... Well, I try to be, yeah.

276
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,999
Ls your ballet teacher an alcoholic?

277
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,835
No.

278
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:15,338
I knew a girl whose ballet teacher
was this alcoholic.

279
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:16,715
I figured they all were.

280
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:19,342
It's true, like, you probably don't know
'cause you're a kid.

281
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,011
When you get older,
you'll realise she goes off to the back

282
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,972
more often than you guys think, you know.

283
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,849
You can smell wine on her breath.

284
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,644
Seriously, it's a big...
it's a big thing for ballet teachers.

285
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,396
It is.

286
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,232
You don't recognise that stuff.

287
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,443
<GROANS>

288
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,487
Wait. Do people really...
You can't play on hard.

289
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,114
No.
it's so hard.

290
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,284
That's insane.

291
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,162
- Hello?
Hi, Johnny.

292
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,581
Hey, Marge.

293
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,709
So, the LA Times wants a quote
on your mother's book.

294
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,879
I think it's better to give them something.

295
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,881
Jesus.

296
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,966
Are you serious?

297
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,843
Yes.

298
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,554
And you need to be in Milan, Wednesday.

299
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,724
We can fly you out tomorrow night
or Tuesday.

300
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,811
Are you there?

301
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,439
Johnny?

302
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,191
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm here.

303
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,568
We'll get you the flight options
later today, okay?

304
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,403
And let us know what you want.

305
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,530
All right. Thanks, Marge.

306
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,491
I'll talk to you later.

307
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,247
Hi, I need a few things.

308
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,917
Could I get three cups of milk,

309
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,795
a stick of butter,

310
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,255
some cheddar cheese.

311
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,801
And do you have a cheese grater
that you could bring up?

312
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,053
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

313
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,019
MALE VOICES 15-30.

314
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,687
Oh, that was my point, huh?

315
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,397
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

316
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:57,690
Press A.

317
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,901
I'm Martina Navratilova.

318
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,986
- You like her?
- Well, who?

319
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,822
Martina Navratilova.

320
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:05,740
She'd like you.

321
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,326
MALE VOICES 30 all.

322
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,455
Oh, look at Martina's power!

323
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,957
Yeah! Oh!

324
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,417
Oh. Oh!

325
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,795
Ah!
40-30.

326
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,214
Martina against who are you?

327
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,174
- Sharapova?
- You're Martina?

328
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:25,093
- You're some communist bitch.
- What?

329
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,595
- Maria Sharapova?
- Yeah. Yeah.

330
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,307
Even Martina wouldn't like you now.

331
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:32,767
Game point.

332
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,395
Wow. Your turn.

333
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,480
Red team wins!

334
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,974
Hey, Layla. Hold on a sec.

335
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:15,351
Yeah?

336
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:18,313
I'm going away for a little while.

337
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:24,068
I need you to take Cleo to camp,
she's going there for e few weeks.

338
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,237
It's close to your parents.

339
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,700
- When are you coming back?
- I don't know.

340
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,953
I need a little time.

341
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,832
How long? I'm going to Italy.

342
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,209
I've got my movie opening there.

343
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:43,546
Just make sure
she gets to Belmont by the 10th.

344
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:46,758
Bye, Johnny.

345
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,801
Yeah.

346
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,062
Welcome to LAX, Mr. Marco.
- Thanks.

347
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,397
Right through those doors
and to the left, please.

348
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,649
Great.

349
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,026
- Got everything?
- Got the passports.

350
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,194
Okay.

351
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,447
Hello.
- Hi.

352
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,331
Right this way.

353
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,622
I

354
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,972
Mr. Marco, I hope you enjoy your suite.

355
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,140
Thank you.

356
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,726
Bedrooms are on the left.

357
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,567
Please, this way.

358
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,072
And here's your swimming pool.

359
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:36,826
Oh, my God!
Wow!

360
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,745
And this is your way
to the salon.

361
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,496
Thank you.

362
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,670
Hey, Pupi

363
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:51,174
This is my daughter, Cleo.

364
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,176
- Hi, Cleo! How are you?
- Hi, I'm good.

365
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,635
Ciao, Cleo.

366
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:58,389
Listen, you take your time in your suite.

367
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,309
And we'll see you downstairs
when you're ready, okay? In the lobby.

368
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:02,852
- Great, thank you.
- Okay.

369
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,688
- Thank you, bye. Enjoy, yeah?
Bye.

370
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,191
Ciao.

371
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:09,859
See you.

372
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,163
- That's fine, Pupi.
Mr. Marco.

373
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,915
- Ah!
- I hope you had a nice rest.

374
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,917
So Pupi's waiting for us in the next room.

375
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,502
Hello, Johnny.

376
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,421
- Hi.
- Can I talk to you?

377
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,382
Yeah. Be right back.

378
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,763
What the fuck, Johnny?

379
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,307
Did you think you'd never
fucking see me again?

380
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,101
Take it easy, okay?

381
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,734
Good news, Johnny!

382
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:54,904
I spoke with the mayor.
He's giving you the key to the city.

383
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,073
Okay, give me the hand, please.

384
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:06,791
Hi, Johnny! How you doing?

385
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,084
- Hi.
- Hey!

386
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,337
Welcome to Italy.

387
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,547
Thank you.

388
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,382
So can I ask you some questions?

389
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,259
- Sure.
- Okay.

390
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,928
What's the first...
Um, what's the most beautiful thing

391
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,596
you have done in Italy so far?

392
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,932
Well, we just arrived in the hotel, so...

393
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,267
Okay.

394
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:33,651
Do you speak some Italian words?
Some few words.

395
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:10,563
- Can you hold your breath?
Huh?

396
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,900
- Can you hold your breath? There and back.
- Okay. I'll try.

397
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,077
- One more.
- It took too long.

398
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:36,714
How about the handstand?

399
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,258
- That was good before.
- Okay.

400
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,559
7.2.

401
00:54:02,198 --> 00:54:03,866
Are you sleeping?

402
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:06,702
No.

403
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,541
You want to get a snack?

404
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:14,126
Yeah.

405
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,430
How can we be of service to you?

406
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:31,143
Um... What kind of gelato do you have?

407
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:35,231
Cioccolata, strawberry, pistachio e vaniglia.

408
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:38,442
Hmm. Well, we'd like to try them all.

409
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:40,695
Uh, could you send up two of each, please?

410
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,613
Certamente, Mr. Marco.

411
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,490
Thank you.

412
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,199
How about vanilla? Did you try it?

413
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:29,118
- Mmm. Good.
- Mmm-mmm.

414
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,543
Mmm.

415
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:42,089
- I like strawberry the best.
- I like chocolate.

416
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,217
I know you do.

417
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,960
- Hi.
Were you sleeping?

418
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,337
No.

419
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,090
Come in.

420
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,929
How old are you, Cleo?

421
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,264
Eleven.

422
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,768
Do you have a boyfriend?

423
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:25,317
When I was eleven
I was so in love with this boy. Nino Viti.

424
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,778
He was so handsome.

425
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,655
And he had a scooter.

426
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,992
Do you like to ride a scooter?

427
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,453
sure.

428
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:37,788
Morning.
- Good morning.

429
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:39,248
Hi.

430
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,102
Mmm.

431
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,981
The coffee's good.

432
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,358
Do you like coffee?

433
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,449
it's good.

434
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:20,122
So, Johnny. We stop by the awards show.

435
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:21,290
Mmm-hmm.

436
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:25,961
You tell something about
your history with Al Pacino, everything.

437
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,798
And after, you remember,
we have the dinner with the mayor.

438
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:31,759
- it's very important. Okay?
- Okay.

439
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:36,722
Wow.

440
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,808
- She's beautiful.
- You look beautiful, Cleo.

441
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:41,602
Thanks.

442
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,648
- Shall we?
- Mmm-hmm.

443
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:29,251
Congratulations!

444
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:32,463
Congratulations, Johnny.

445
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,724
The stage is yours.

446
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,297
No, no, no! No, no!

447
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:59,216
This is Miss Lane's car.

448
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,009
Can you please take us to the airport?

449
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:05,180
I'm supposed to be waiting here but...
For you, Mr. Marco, we'll go.

450
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:07,474
- I'll get you there.
- Thank you.

451
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:38,297
- Hey.
- Hey.

452
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,799
- Welcome back. Nice to see you.
- Thanks.

453
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,768
You take that spot.

454
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,528
How you doing?

455
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:03,489
- Tired.
- Yeah, me too.

456
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,368
Hi, Johnny, welcome back.

457
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,746
Hey, Romulo, how are things, man?

458
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:13,415
Good. Would you like a song?

459
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:15,751
Good.

460
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,880
Have you ever heard him sing before?

461
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,049
Just wait. He's great.

462
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:45,405
Baby, let me be your loving teddy bear

463
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:50,619
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere

464
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:55,707
Oh, let me be your teddy bear

465
01:03:56,792 --> 01:04:01,672
Baby, let me be around you every night

466
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:06,051
Run your fingers through my hair
and cuddle me real tight

467
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:10,305
Oh, let me be your teddy bear

468
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:16,812
I don't wanna be a tiger
'Cause tigers play too rough

469
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,314
I don't wanna be a lion

470
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:23,151
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough

471
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:28,240
Just wanna be your teddy bear

472
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:33,328
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere

473
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:37,332
Oh, let me be your teddy bear

474
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:44,298
I just wanna be your teddy bear

475
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:51,305
Thank you very much.
- Thanks, Romulo.

476
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,895
- Morning, beautiful.
- Good morning, Victor.

477
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:23,146
I have your orange juice.

478
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,773
Thank you.
Oh, can you bring it in the kitchen?

479
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,024
Yeah.

480
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,698
Mmm. This is so good.

481
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,616
Yeah, it's really good, Cleo.

482
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,785
- Mmm, you got the sauce perfect.
- Thanks.

483
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,537
It's, like, not too heavy.

484
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:40,455
Mmm.

485
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:43,917
I'm making a list
for the things I need for camp.

486
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,752
I have tennis racquet, tennis balls,

487
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:48,714
bathing suit, shampoo and conditioner.
What else?

488
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:50,173
- Sunglasses.
- Okay.

489
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:52,467
Bring your own soap.

490
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:56,680
So you don't get warts from the other kids.
That always happens at camp.

491
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:58,932
Ask your dad.

492
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,311
Maybe some snacks. You might get hungry.

493
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,855
You're not allowed.

494
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:07,733
Well, you can sneak a little in your backpack.

495
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,693
Get hungry at night or something.

496
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,366
Wow.

497
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:20,996
Oh, I like that spin move. What is that?

498
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,497
Chaîné turn.

499
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:25,375
Cool. Chainay-nay turn.

500
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:31,131
That's one of the fundamentals
of Afro-Cuban dancing, huh?

501
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,800
Is that what you're doing?

502
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,635
- Ballet.
Oh, ballet.

503
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:38,055
We're almost there.

504
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,977
Have you read all these, Dad?

505
01:07:44,186 --> 01:07:45,520
None of them.

506
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,066
I've got an idea. Why don't you be my reader?

507
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:52,527
You read them and tell me
if the character is any good.

508
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:53,862
I'll check it out.

509
01:07:54,196 --> 01:07:55,739
Why don't we read Cleo's diary?

510
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:56,907
No.

511
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:00,368
When me and your dad
were a little bit older than you,

512
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,120
we got your Aunt Tiffany's diary,

513
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:04,539
and she was going through, like,
a rebellious stage.

514
01:08:04,623 --> 01:08:07,542
And we read it all dramatically
to a tape recorder

515
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,669
and we waited until she got home.

516
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:12,714
And, it was like... It was really bad.

517
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:15,383
We put it on the stereo
and turned it on really loud.

518
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:18,386
And then we just went running.

519
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,763
- Oh! I got it.
- What'd she do?

520
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,139
She raised hell.

521
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,267
I just heard her screaming and crying.

522
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,937
I wasn't allowed over for like a month.

523
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:30,774
- They should have kicked your dad out, too.
- I got it.

524
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,277
We were looking for adventure, though.

525
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,737
Oh, crap.

526
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,656
Oh!

527
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,408
Damn.

528
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:42,702
Souvenir?

529
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:45,705
- That smells.
- No, no, no.

530
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:47,415
Smell it, smell it.

531
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,044
All right. Anybody following us?

532
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,882
No. The coast is clear.

533
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,804
Have you talked to your mom?

534
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:46,892
No, I left her a message.

535
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,977
How has she been doing?

536
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,855
She's good, I guess.

537
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,531
Whoa!

538
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:03,867
What the... Hold on.

539
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,163
Damn it.

540
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:16,254
Hey. I was driving...

541
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:19,674
I need a tow.

542
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,053
Sunset and Sierra.

543
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:27,098
No.

544
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:33,855
Thanks.

545
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,446
Now what?

546
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,002
There you go.

547
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,681
This is not a good time.

548
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:09,849
Are you sure?

549
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,518
Yeah.

550
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:14,896
- Hey, Cleo, you hungry?
- Mmm-hmm.

551
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,691
- You want to go downstairs, get a burger?
- Oh, yeah.

552
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:27,075
- All right. So what do you got?
- A triple.

553
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:28,535
Get out of there.

554
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,832
- Two tens.
- Shuffle 'em.

555
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:39,045
Am I ever going to win a game today or...

556
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,589
Think I'll win? Can I win a game?

557
01:11:42,424 --> 01:11:43,883
Oh, there's your outfit.

558
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:50,724
- I think that hat would look good on you.
- it's a turban.

559
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,101
Well, maybe we should get you
one of those for camp?

560
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:55,437
That's embarrassing.

561
01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,441
Look at their outfits.

562
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,693
Val Kilmer calls himself Val-ibu.

563
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:07,115
Check this out. Cleo.

564
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:09,743
Hi, Johnny.

565
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,912
Hey, how you doing?

566
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:14,164
Good.

567
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,587
What? I don't know her that well.

568
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,633
The airplane!

569
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:28,345
I used to do this. It was a lot easier.

570
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:40,940
You're getting big.

571
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,820
Hey, you want to stay one more day
before we go?

572
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:47,030
Yeah.

573
01:12:53,328 --> 01:12:54,871
It's that sound it makes
when we're doing good.

574
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,456
I like that sound.

575
01:12:58,249 --> 01:12:59,918
- Okay, here we go.
- I'll let that one go.

576
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:04,798
- I got it.
- Okay.

577
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:06,674
Okay.

578
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:44,462
- How are you doing?
- I'm good.

579
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,365
- Can we pet him?
- Yes.

580
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:36,991
Oh, hey!

581
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:39,410
Hey, sweetie! Hi!

582
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:43,373
What's that book about again?

583
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,251
it's about this girl
that's in love with this guy.

584
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:50,296
But he's a vampire
and his whole family is vampires,

585
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,131
so she can't really be with him.

586
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:54,050
Why doesn't she become one, too?

587
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:57,428
Because she can't.
He doesn't want to turn her into a vampire.

588
01:15:57,512 --> 01:16:00,640
And if she gets too close to him,
he won't be able to help himself.

589
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,225
Oh!

590
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:50,064
Okay.

591
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:53,526
- You need that? No?
- No.

592
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:01,367
Allow me.

593
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,123
- See you, Ray.
Take care, Johnny.

594
01:18:20,822 --> 01:18:22,490
Cleo, what's wrong?

595
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:24,617
Why are you crying?

596
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,498
I don't know when Mom's coming back.

597
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:39,173
She said she had to go away for a while.

598
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:42,260
But she didn't say
when she was coming back.

599
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:45,513
And you're always gone.

600
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:55,815
Come here.

601
01:18:56,524 --> 01:18:58,234
Don't cry, honey.

602
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:38,816
Another two...

603
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,151
- That's a bet, sir.
- Come on.

604
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,069
Come on, 11.

605
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,739
- Seven.
- Seven.

606
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:50,495
Excuse me, sir. She can't be at the table.
She has to take a step back.

607
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,622
Okay. Stand over there.

608
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:58,795
- Okay, folks.
- All right, here we go. Here we go.

609
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:00,046
Come on!

610
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:03,841
All righty. Watch this.

611
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:06,260
You always want to take the full odds.

612
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:08,304
Always. it's the best bet.

613
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:11,015
It's the only bet where the house
and the player have the same advantage.

614
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:12,266
You got it?

615
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:14,227
- Okay. Got it.
- Okay, sir, your dice.

616
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,232
- Go hard 10. Hard 10.
- That's a bet, sir.

617
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:21,692
- I want a hard 10. Say, "Hard 10."
- Hard 10.

618
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:23,528
Hard 10. Come on!

619
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:26,030
- it's okay. it's all right.
- Four, four...

620
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:27,907
- Easy four.
- I'm still in there.

621
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:29,909
Still alive.

622
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:32,870
Sorry there.

623
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:34,914
- Hard 10. Come on!
- Your dice.

624
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,041
Hard 10!

625
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,378
Hard 10!

626
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:43,047
We got it, we got both wins.

627
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:43,649
All right.

628
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:45,318
Have fun at camp.

629
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:49,280
- I'll see you in a few weeks.
- Okay.

630
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:56,495
Okay.

631
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,166
- Bye.
- Bye.

632
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:12,511
Cleo!

633
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,771
I'm sorry I haven't been around.

634
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:45,474
Hello.
- Layla?

635
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:47,768
Johnny.

636
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:50,062
Hey.

637
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:54,358
What's wrong?

638
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:02,658
I'm fucking nothing.

639
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:14,295
I'm not even a person.

640
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,968
Why don't you try volunteering
or something?

641
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:22,261
No.

642
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,146
I don't know what to do.

643
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,783
I'm just... I want...

644
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:49,705
Can you... Can you come over? Just...

645
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,459
Can you come over?

646
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,294
No, I can't.

647
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,300
All right. Thanks.

648
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,510
Johnny, you're gonna be okay.

649
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:59,061
Hello, Mr. Marco.
How can I help you today?

650
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,896
Hey, is Serena around?

651
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:03,899
You know, she's not in.
Can I help you with something?

652
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,443
I'm gonna be checking out.

653
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:10,406
Oh, all right. Well, should we put your things
in storage until you return?

654
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:13,826
No. Just box it up
and I'll get an address to you.

655
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,702
Yes, Mr. Marco. Have a great day.

656
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:17,037
