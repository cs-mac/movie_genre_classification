1
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:33,484
We're almost there.

2
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:36,353
Is that supposed
to make me stop?

3
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:40,123
You're gonna make me crazy.
I'm gonna have to pull over.

4
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,192
So pull over.

5
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:24,563
Lauduree!

6
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:28,567
Trying to sleep.

7
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:29,969
Did gigi call?

8
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,437
Yeah.

9
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,938
What'd you tell her?

10
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,974
The truth.

11
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,876
Shit! Ree!

12
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,113
Just kidding.

13
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,482
You're not gonna believe what
happened... my phone died.

14
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:47,217
It jumped right out of the canoe
into the lake, and Tommy tried...

15
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,518
Okay.

16
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,325
Good night, my little boobaloo.

17
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,929
Good night,
my little sugar booger.

18
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,001
Thanks, Ree.

19
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,104
Did you have fun?

20
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:09,938
Yeah.

21
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,573
Then what's wrong?

22
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:14,542
He's here now, and I just want
to cuddle up.

23
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:18,480
Well, can't you tell him
to go home?

24
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:20,649
Yes.

25
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:22,950
Y'all having a slumber
party in here!

26
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:25,920
Tommy, I am tucking
my daughter in.

27
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,221
Can I watch?

28
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:29,356
That is so wrong!

29
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,659
Tommy, this is Lauduree.

30
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,626
She's gonna save
the world someday.

31
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:35,495
Hi.

32
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:36,629
Hi.

33
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:43,202
Oh, you're waiting for me,

34
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,369
Aren't you, sweetie?

35
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,939
Okay, I'll just be one minute.

36
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,110
Okay, rooster.

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,547
Did you water your plants?

38
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,650
Did you water your trees?

39
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:01,152
Uh-huh.

40
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:03,454
Do you forgive me?

41
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:11,695
Okay, guys.

42
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:14,531
Here is your extra
credit question,

43
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,367
and you have 15 minutes
to answer.

44
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,401
Why...

45
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:21,403
Does science matter?

46
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,706
For makin' babies!

47
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,709
Actually, Alex,
that's an excellent answer.

48
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:31,612
And if you guys can
answer that using science,

49
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,681
you will get 25 extra points,

50
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:37,151
which you guys need, 'cause
your test scores are dismal.

51
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:42,723
So, not a great way to start
the year, guys, okay?

52
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:46,560
See you guys writing...
already. Good.

Hi.

74
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,908
Your mom wanted me to check
on you on my way to work.

75
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,444
Wait a minute, my phone.

76
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:47,346
Hey.

77
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:50,749
I-I can't hear you, the reception's
bad out here. Hang on.

78
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,851
Are you okay?

79
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:55,587
Yeah, I have a test tomorrow.

80
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:58,590
Well, if your mom forgets to come
home tonight, you call me.

81
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:00,792
She's doing 'mary kay.'

82
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,627
I know what she's doing, hon.

83
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,796
Have her call me.

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,910
Mom.

88
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,549
Pretty pro, huh?

89
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:41,817
Boo!

90
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:16,449
La la la la! Stupid asshole
piece of shit!

91
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:18,718
Screw you! Fuck you!

92
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,608
Oh. Hi.

93
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,977
I didn't see you sitting there.

94
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,789
My name is Neel.
I just moved here.

95
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:05,694
Lauduree's very pretty.

96
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:07,829
Where'd it come from?

97
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:09,130
My mom made it up.

98
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:10,998
She was obsessed
with french things.

99
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,101
Is she not alive anymore?

100
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:16,904
No.

101
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,977
What are you reading?

102
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:27,881
An article that says
that the buildup

103
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:30,683
of carbon dioxide
is killing off coral.

104
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:32,418
It's poisoning
their food source,

105
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,986
so they're spitting out
their own tissue

106
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,854
and starving to death.

107
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:37,923
It's why they're turning white.

108
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:44,595
Are you going to the Science
Club meeting tomorrow?

109
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:46,831
I'm trying to read.

110
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,599
Ms. Markovi's really cool.

111
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:51,969
I think she's Macedonian.

112
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:54,037
I'll save you a seat.

113
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:35,943
<i>Hey, it's Tanya and Ree.</i>

114
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:37,811
<i>Leave us a message
after the beep.</i>

115
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,546
Hey, girls, it's Gigi.

116
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:42,782
I'm inviting y'all
for dinner tomorrow.

117
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:45,117
Ed, his daughters,
and the grandkids

118
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:48,688
are making a special trip
down from Owensboro.

119
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,056
I got really good news.

120
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:53,058
<i>Okay, call me. Bye.</i>

121
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,199
Hey.

122
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:10,274
Yeah, I just gotta go get
something from my locker.

123
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:15,211
Hey, how's it goin', buddy?

124
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:17,914
How's my little science
nerd doing today?

125
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,649
Huh? Huh? You like my
armpits, creep?

126
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:23,520
- They stinky? They stinky?
- Oh, nice! From gym class!

127
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:27,122
Look me in the eye! Look
me in the eye, butt wad!

128
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:29,258
- It's trash girl!
- Trash girl!

129
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,895
It's trash girl.
Is she gonna save us?

130
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,563
- She can't do it...!
- Leave him alone.

131
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,967
Gettin' your girlfriend
to fight your battles.

132
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,103
I'll kick your balls, piss ant.

133
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:45,139
Did she just say piss ant?

134
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:47,675
Let's go. Let's leave this loser

135
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:50,210
for someone else
to take care of, huh?

136
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:56,116
Do you need me
to call a teacher?

137
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:00,653
So... welcome to Science Club.

138
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:03,923
We have two brave souls.
You like raisins?

139
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,190
You?

140
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,825
Good.

141
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:08,260
And we will get started.

142
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:09,995
Biodiversity.

143
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:11,796
You know what that is,
right, guys?

144
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:14,599
The number of plant and animal
species in the ecosystem.

145
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:18,670
Right. What's the plainest language
we can put that in?

146
00:14:18,672 --> 00:14:20,004
Life.

147
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:22,273
Yeah. Biodiversity.

148
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,809
What else do we know
about biodiversity?

149
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,879
It's being threatened by global warming.
Yep. Mmhmm.

150
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:31,582
What are some other threats? Neel?
Polution.

151
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:36,886
Deforestation.
Mmhmm. And the list could go on.

152
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:38,888
So most scientists agree

153
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,223
that the rate of species
loss is greater

154
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:42,892
than it's ever been
in human history.

155
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:44,694
I mean, this is a big deal.

156
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:47,762
This is something that scientists should
be talking about more, right?

157
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:49,731
And we're not.

158
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,200
So my challenge to you
as young scientists is,

159
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:54,235
how do you guys propose
we get the data

160
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:57,105
out of the laboratory
and into the community?

161
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:58,305
By telling people?

162
00:14:58,307 --> 00:15:00,040
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

163
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,343
We need to tell people.

164
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:05,379
But more than that,
we need to involve people,

165
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,915
'cause that's where stuff
starts to happen.

166
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,149
So what I thought we would do

167
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:12,652
is something called
community interventions,

168
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,787
where we take these field trips...
I... I started...

169
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,789
a science project
in the spring already.

170
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,726
I didn't know we were
gonna do a group one.

171
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:22,794
Oh! Well... tell us about it.

172
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,231
Well, my hypothesis is
that in our region,

173
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:29,635
the loblolly pine affixes more
carbon dioxide yearly

174
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,836
than the red oak.

175
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:32,036
Great.

176
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:34,338
So you're trying to use
photosynthesis.

177
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,240
To pull CO2 out of
the atmosphere.

178
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:37,675
- It's a great premise.
- Yeah.

179
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:40,144
Whichever species
uses the most CO2

180
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:42,146
could be planted as
forests in our region

181
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:44,414
to reverse the effects
of global warming.

182
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,350
This is something scientists are
talking a lot about right now.

183
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:51,021
However, from what I've
read about carbon sinks,

184
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:53,123
which is what you're
trying to create,

185
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,357
more forests can
actually raise temps.

186
00:15:56,893 --> 00:16:00,062
I haven't been looking
at temperature change

187
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,364
because the trees are too small.

188
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:05,334
What you're proposing is
extremely complicated.

189
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:06,834
I mean, there is
a lot of variables.

190
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,404
It's very tricky to model,
even for scientists,

191
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:13,241
especially with climate patterns
becoming so unpredictable.

192
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,290
Lauduree.

193
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,759
I-I thought your mom
was picking you up.

194
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,930
I forgot, she has
to work on thursdays.

195
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:41,266
Well, get into the car.
I'll take you home. Come on.

196
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:55,713
We can change the meeting night.
I can call your mom.

197
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:01,285
I decided I'm not doing science
club this year. - Why?

198
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:04,187
I've spent too much time
with my tree data.

199
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,389
I'm not giving up now.

200
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:10,393
I mean, we're gonna learn a
lot about conservation issues.

201
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,895
I know you're interested in
that from your extra credit.

202
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:14,030
Neel's really smart.

203
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,231
I think you guys would
make a great team.

204
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,868
I don't work with partners.

205
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,440
Who wants a burger? Huh?

206
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:30,344
Greta, honey? You coming back?

207
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:36,150
<i>Hey, you've reached
my voicemail.</i>

208
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:38,451
<i>I'm waiting for your
secret message.</i>

209
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:40,887
<i>Well, here's my secret message:</i>

210
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,757
Ed and I are moving.
I'll send you a postcard.

211
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:36,938
Same time next week?

212
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,822
You like it in the ground.

213
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:57,524
I'd sleep out here
with you tonight,

214
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:59,458
but I can't risk a tick bite.

215
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:29,153
Can you believe
how good she looks?

216
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:31,856
Do you sell light bulbs?

217
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:32,956
Right there.

218
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,966
You want one?

219
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,634
Nah, it's okay.

220
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:53,342
Total is $19.72.

221
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:01,215
I think these have expired, hon.

222
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:05,553
Hold on. Let me talk to
the manager a second.

223
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:35,213
Will you give me a ride?

224
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:36,347
Sure.

225
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:40,918
Hey! Ernesto! Hey!

226
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:50,560
Did you get any I.D.?

227
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:57,934
- Whoo!
- Hot damn!

228
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:59,969
That was like fate
that I was there!

229
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:01,971
Yeah, that was awesome.
Thanks for the ride.

230
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:04,940
Sure. I won't tell
your mom, but...

231
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:06,541
Is she here?

232
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:07,709
No.

233
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,686
Listen, honey,

234
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:21,722
they're not gonna
press charges, okay?

235
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:25,259
But the deal is, I need to speak
to a guardian.

236
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:27,961
What about your dad?

237
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:30,129
I don't have one.

238
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:34,634
All right, I guess you'd better get
started on your homework, then.

239
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,302
If your mom's not
back in an hour,

240
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:38,537
I'm gonna have to take you
down to the jail.

241
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,505
I need to file a report.

242
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,345
You got somebody you wanna call?

243
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,348
No.

244
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:56,087
So why are these things so
expensive? They last longer?

245
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,491
Looks like you're in luck.

246
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:05,095
What happened?

247
00:22:05,097 --> 00:22:06,429
- You Mrs. Cready?
- Yes.

248
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:08,465
Well, we picked up your
daughter for shoplifting.

249
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:10,567
Tanya!
There's not gonna be any charges...

250
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:13,102
but, you know, you may
wanna keep an eye on her.

251
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:16,305
And next time I see you, you'd better
be giving your valedictorian speech.

252
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:17,506
Valedictorian?!

253
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,041
She's a terrible thief.

254
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,481
What's going on?

255
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:28,182
I shoplifted.

256
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:30,018
I can see that.

257
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,186
Why were you shoplifting,
and more importantly,

258
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:34,288
where is your mother?

259
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,289
Do you know that Roy called me,

260
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,291
and the goddamn rent check
is late again.

261
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:43,463
The district manager requested
her for a bachelorette party.

262
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:45,632
They... they liked her best.

263
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:53,039
- How'd you get to the store?
- I walked.

264
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:56,208
You walked two goddamn miles
to shoplift a light bulb?

265
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,676
I like walking.

266
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,546
Where's your vanity?

267
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,650
Huh? Where is it?

268
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,585
Mom loaned it to Juanita
for the miss apple pageant.

269
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,087
Where... where's the TV?

270
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,689
It broke. No, you shouldn't
go back there.

271
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,091
Why? - Something really
bad happened.

272
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,559
- Roy was supposed to...
- Oh, really?

273
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,127
- What happened, huh? What?
- It was really bad.

274
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,630
You better tell me what's going on,
Lauduree,

275
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:22,465
or I'm gonna find it
out for myself!

276
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:25,668
She moved.

277
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,704
She what?

278
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:31,207
She moved to California!

279
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:59,766
I'll see you in hell, Tanya.

280
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,210
I haven't seen
Mr. banana in years.

281
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:16,615
Want me to lay with you
till you fall asleep?

282
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,855
You must be feeling
pretty crummy.

283
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,492
I'm here if you want
to talk about it.

284
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:34,631
Right.

285
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:43,239
What were you planning doing
out here all by yourself?

286
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:44,507
Living.

287
00:24:46,576 --> 00:24:49,345
Aren't you afraid
it'd get lonesome?

288
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:51,580
You live alone.

289
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:53,715
I have, for a long time.

290
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:58,686
I don't want to leave my home.

291
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:02,223
I don't blame you, hon.

292
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:08,595
Let's not talk about it tonight.

293
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:10,164
We're wiped out.
Let's get some rest.

294
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,266
We'll talk about it
in the morning, okay?

295
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:20,206
No, it's not.
It's based on evidence.

296
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,841
Hey, Ree, you up?

297
00:25:21,843 --> 00:25:23,809
Yeah, I'm just working
on a report.

298
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:25,778
- Well, what time's your bus?
- No, there's no more debate.

299
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,612
Just follow the hot spots.

300
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:30,649
Listen to me. Spring is happening...
Ree!

301
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:34,319
Hon, you're talkin'
in your sleep.

302
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,623
What time is it?

303
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,558
It's 6:45. Let's go.

304
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:46,897
I don't like to lollygag,

305
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:49,400
so I'm gonna spend the day
doing stuff around here.

306
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:51,201
Like what?

307
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:55,371
Well, I gotta pack up everything
to move it to my house.

308
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:58,641
- Now, I talked to Roy, and he said...
- When did you talk to Roy?

309
00:25:58,643 --> 00:26:00,476
Well, earlier this morning.

310
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:02,477
- Did he call?
- I called him.

311
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,380
Thought you said we would
talk about it in the morning.

312
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:08,317
Lauduree, there is
nothing to talk about.

313
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,385
You are 13 years old.

314
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:13,421
You cannot live here on
your own. That is it.

315
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:14,755
Why?

316
00:26:14,757 --> 00:26:16,757
Well, for one thing,
the criminal life

317
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,759
doesn't seem to be working
out so well for you.

318
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:22,263
I told you, I'm working
as a tutor to pay the rent.

319
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:26,233
- What is it? You don't like me?
- I like you.

320
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:28,668
Then what is so bad about
coming to live with me?

321
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,270
I can't leave my research.

322
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,506
Lauduree, you are
not a scientist.

323
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,542
You are a minor
without a mother.

324
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:39,445
I am in the middle
of finding out.

325
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:41,547
That fix a greater
proportion of CO2

326
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,349
in the atmosphere than oaks.

327
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,783
If you make me leave now,

328
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:47,286
I'll have to abandon
six months' of data.

329
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:51,356
Lauduree, look,

330
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:56,294
I know that you are an extremely
self-sufficient girl,

331
00:26:56,296 --> 00:27:00,530
but even if I could abide you
living out here on your own,

332
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:03,667
the state would come in,
and they would take you away

333
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:04,968
and place you in a foster home.

334
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,037
Now, is that what you want? Huh?

335
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:17,813
And anyway, I am not gonna be
around here to bail you out.

336
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:19,448
Ed and I are movin'.

337
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,317
- What?
- Yeah.

338
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,486
To Florida, just as soon
as the house sells.

339
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:26,821
I'm not going.

340
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:28,957
Well, you can take
those trees with you.

341
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,492
<i>No, I can't, because pinus taeda</i>

342
00:27:30,494 --> 00:27:32,460
will not survive in
a tropical climate.

343
00:27:32,462 --> 00:27:34,662
And guess what?
We're running out of time!

344
00:27:34,664 --> 00:27:38,332
Well, you really don't have any
choice in the matter, do you?

345
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:42,803
Do you realize the situation
your mother's placed us in?

346
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,353
You had a piece of
hair sticking up.

347
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:06,458
It looked cool.

348
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:19,969
How do you know they'll survive?

349
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:22,639
I think they'll do just fine.

350
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:24,808
Can't promise, though, can you?

351
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,376
No, Ree, I can't,

352
00:28:26,378 --> 00:28:28,778
because there are all sorts
of things in this world

353
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,646
that are beyond my control.

354
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:32,047
Like what?

355
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:34,883
Like a fungus.

356
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:37,386
Or you could mow them over
like you did mom's stargazers.

357
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:38,987
That was a mistake
for christ's sake.

358
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:41,890
Just tie a ribbon around them,
they'll be just fine.

359
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:43,858
Not if you've tied 'em on.

360
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:56,036
I'm gonna get ya!

361
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,580
Hey, you want me
to make you a scar?

362
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,415
- Nah.
- Yeah? Come on!

363
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:10,850
Don't be such a fuddy-duddy.

364
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:12,451
I'm not. I just don't
like looking weird.

365
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:13,953
Well, I'll make you
look pretty, then.

366
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:15,588
I don't want to look
pretty, either.

367
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,456
<i>What do you want to look like, then?
Mom.</i>

368
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,692
- Mom.
- Hmm-hmm?

369
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:21,826
Mom, look what I found.

370
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:22,961
Pretty.

371
00:29:22,963 --> 00:29:25,597
Will you take my picture?

372
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,499
Sure.

373
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,099
Where'd you get this?

374
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,701
Tommy.

375
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:32,403
I gotta get my
portfolio together.

376
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:33,837
Tout de suite, cherie.

377
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,407
This is the big time.

378
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,680
Mew. Another. I wasn't ready.

379
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:44,129
Okay. Okay.

380
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,951
Cheese!

381
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:01,163
Hey. I'm gonna
smoke a cigarette.

382
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:03,531
Why don't you go on in
and say goodbye?

383
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,625
I'm just saying,
don't bug me about that.

384
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:34,993
Don't...

385
00:30:34,995 --> 00:30:38,162
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not mad. No...</i>

386
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:43,201
<i>I'll call in to work.</i>

387
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:46,471
<i>No, what are they gonna say?</i>

388
00:30:46,473 --> 00:30:47,839
<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

389
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,979
<i>I'll call you back. Bye.</i>

390
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,864
Thanks, Ed. It's, um...

391
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,866
It's really big.

392
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:33,834
You're welcome.

393
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:38,239
So what's this I hear about your
mom driving to California?

394
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:40,608
She wants to be a makeup artist.

395
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,878
Well, I just want to say,
Ree, how sorry I am.

396
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,279
She's not dead.

397
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:48,014
What'd she say?

398
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:49,950
She didn't die, Ed.

399
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:52,886
That's awful, Ree. I would
never say something like that.

400
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,221
Hon, you want to
start up the grill?

401
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:57,590
Sure.

402
00:32:57,592 --> 00:33:01,627
Oh... I got you this too.

403
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:03,629
Thought you might like it.

404
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:09,367
Everybody's doing the
best that they can,

405
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:12,103
and you'd better rise
to the occasion, hon.

406
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:19,109
Real page-turner, huh?

407
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:21,945
What's happening now, Ree?

408
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:25,682
They're lost.
Everyone back at base camp

409
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:28,151
thinks they've either
died of hypothermia

410
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:29,719
or eaten each other.

411
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:30,987
Ooh.

412
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:32,788
Now, you want to do
something like that?

413
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,192
Work at a weather station
under perilous conditions?

414
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:38,094
It's just a story.

415
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:39,662
Well, sure, but...

416
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,461
<i>I mean, people really do
do stuff like that, you know?</i>

417
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:46,011
You could definitely get that
kind of training in Florida.

418
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:48,529
And it's a lot warmer
than the Himalayas.

419
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:51,132
Anyplace is warmer
than the Himalayas, Ed.

420
00:33:51,707 --> 00:33:53,173
The Himalayan glaciers

421
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:56,677
are actually melting faster than
any glacier in the world,

422
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,881
<i>and over a billion people
depend on them for water.</i>

423
00:34:00,883 --> 00:34:03,082
<i>- A billion.
- Hmm.</i>

424
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:06,185
Your grandma hates
the cold, don't you, hon?

425
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:08,855
I live through it.
Every year, Ed.

426
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:10,356
Ree, did you know

427
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:13,826
that the Kennedy Space Center
is in Florida, and they have got

428
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:16,928
every kind of research facility
that you can think of.

429
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,965
As a matter of fact,
right next door to my condo

430
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:22,868
is the school for meteorology,

431
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,970
Which is global warming, Right?

432
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:26,303
Weather patterns.

433
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:29,206
I'm more interested in
wilderness preservation.

434
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:31,909
Florida is a wilderness paradise.

435
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:33,711
Ree...

436
00:34:33,713 --> 00:34:38,214
One of the sharpest kids
that I have ever met.

437
00:34:38,216 --> 00:34:40,984
- What do you want to do?
- You just asked her that, Ed.

438
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:42,986
Well, no, Greta, I did not.

439
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:46,256
Whatever it is that
you are after,

440
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:49,024
you need to promise yourself,

441
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:52,761
make a promise to yourself
that you will try to get there.

442
00:34:52,763 --> 00:34:54,997
In case you haven't noticed, Ed,

443
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:59,301
we are not in the mood for one
of your motivational speeches

444
00:34:59,303 --> 00:35:02,336
because we are sucking lemons.

445
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:04,172
'Course, if we were Himalayan,

446
00:35:04,174 --> 00:35:07,308
we'd be making lemonade,
and we'd be grateful.

447
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:15,348
What do you think, Ree?

448
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,418
I think Florida's gonna be
underwater in 30 years, Ed.

449
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:36,835
Yeah, that book?!

450
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:38,303
<i>That book now?!</i>

451
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,905
Yeah, well, I thought the book
would be a good idea.

452
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:42,440
Just lookit. She's interested.

453
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:45,744
- Death and Mayhem.
- I know, I know!

454
00:35:45,746 --> 00:35:47,377
What do you wanna do?

455
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,446
There's so much
tension in this house.

456
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:52,182
I know. You're smoking again!

457
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,051
I don't even want to know

458
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:55,519
what kind of a wreck
you would be

459
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,987
if you had to look after
little Caleb and Courtney

460
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,155
all by yourself.

461
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,890
I suppose I would have
called the police.

462
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,359
Right! Because if Mandy
or Tina disappeared,

463
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,795
that would mean that
they had been kidnaped.

464
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,930
Mine, on the other,
disappeared her own goddamn self!

465
00:36:08,932 --> 00:36:10,365
She ran away, Greta!

466
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:12,934
Ed, she's a 30-year-old
woman, she's not a runaway.

467
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:16,471
So I guess looking for her
is out of the question.

468
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:18,473
I didn't say that.

469
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:20,908
Well, Lauduree certainly
wasn't warm

470
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,443
to the idea of
moving to Florida.

471
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,845
Well... maybe it's better
if she just stays put.

472
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:27,181
What, so she can get
knocked up her junior year?

473
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:30,217
Ed, I'm just talking till
the end of the school year.

474
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:34,154
You could move in here.

475
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,339
My mom's coming back.

476
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:57,842
Whatever floats your boat.

477
00:36:57,844 --> 00:36:59,443
<i>Weather will spell</i>

478
00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:01,846
<i>economic disaster
for many local farmers,</i>

479
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:05,817
<i>as extreme draught continues to
plague the tri-state area.</i>

480
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:07,584
Mustard or mayo?

481
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:09,119
Dry.

482
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:11,154
<i>Temperatures in the upper 90s.</i>

483
00:37:11,156 --> 00:37:14,191
<i>That the prices of corn
and soy could soar.</i>

484
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:50,967
How 'bout plants?

485
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:52,234
Very good.

486
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:54,470
Local plant or flower?

487
00:39:56,506 --> 00:39:58,540
I'm ready to help.

488
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,141
Awesome.

489
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:02,010
We're just getting ready
to do interviews.

490
00:40:02,012 --> 00:40:04,079
Let's go. Grab your backpack.

491
00:40:09,118 --> 00:40:11,218
Okay.

492
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,722
Hi, I'm a member of the Central
School Science Club.

493
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:16,523
Would you have a minute
to tell us about

494
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:18,726
your favorite local
animal or insect?

495
00:40:18,728 --> 00:40:21,027
<i>I always loved butterflies,</i>

496
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:23,096
<i>the yellow kind
that look like tissue.</i>

497
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:25,732
<i>Oh, and of course, cicadas.</i>

498
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:28,001
There's someone,
Lauduree. Go for it.

499
00:40:28,003 --> 00:40:30,737
We're talking to people
in the community

500
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:35,240
about how environmental disruption...
Sorry.

501
00:40:35,242 --> 00:40:36,775
<i>I love horses. I love horses.</i>

502
00:40:36,777 --> 00:40:39,745
<i>It's a passion of mine.
I love to ride,</i>

503
00:40:39,747 --> 00:40:42,314
<i>and, you know,
I used to ride, like,</i>

504
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:43,748
<i>english, western, you know,</i>

505
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,549
<i>and then I went into bareback.</i>

506
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:47,718
<i>I like snapping turtles.</i>

507
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:52,323
<i>I remember him showing me
this beautiful,</i>

508
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,325
<i>snowy-white egret,</i>

509
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,192
<i>and... but, you know,</i>

510
00:40:56,194 --> 00:40:59,162
<i>you don't see them
around here anymore.</i>

511
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:02,766
<i>You know, I haven't
seen any in... 14 years.</i>

512
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:05,468
<i>They used to come around
every summer.</i>

513
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,536
<i>I used to be able to
catch lake sturgeon</i>

514
00:41:07,538 --> 00:41:09,171
<i>this big across't.</i>

515
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:12,474
<i>I haven't caught any
like that in 20 years.</i>

516
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:15,244
<i>What are you laughing at?</i>

517
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:17,146
<i>Pigtoes!</i>

518
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:20,481
All right, so...

519
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:23,518
a pigtoe looks like, um...

520
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,219
looks like the...

521
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:27,088
<i>Pleurobema Serlus.</i>

522
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,290
Let me see.

523
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:31,224
"Habitats include
streams and creeks

524
00:41:31,226 --> 00:41:34,194
in and around Jackson County
Nature Preserve."

525
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:35,495
That's right by my house.

526
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:38,165
"They ingest algae, bacteria,
and other detritus

527
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:39,499
in the water."

528
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,167
They're natural filters.

529
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:42,468
They keep the water clean.

530
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,803
It says here that
they're in danger.

531
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:45,671
Maybe we've found the hero
to our food web, guys.

532
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:47,773
They're primary consumers.

533
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:50,776
Their ecosystem is fragile.
Their habitat is endangered.

534
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:53,745
Endangered doesn't mean they're
past the point of no return, right?

535
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:57,382
No. Some mussels species have
lived over a hundred years.

536
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:59,350
If you find one in this draught,

537
00:41:59,352 --> 00:42:01,252
you have a chance
at restoration.

538
00:42:01,254 --> 00:42:03,455
Save the pigtoe!

539
00:42:03,457 --> 00:42:05,089
Why not?

540
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:23,473
Hey, where did you buy
this lovely...?

541
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,308
They were on sale
at J.C. Penney!

542
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,510
<i>Oh, he's taking advice
from strangers!</i>

543
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,811
I can't believe you
bought this for me!

544
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,646
You should have seen the girl!

545
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:33,281
What did you say?

546
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:35,817
I said, "Oh, she's
about this big, and..."

547
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,253
"and she's..."

548
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:40,421
well... just...

549
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:42,356
<i>I think they thought
it was for me!</i>

550
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:45,687
Wait a minute. I am going to go over
to meet the boys at the VFW.

551
00:42:46,016 --> 00:42:47,681
Would you like to buy a vowel?

552
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:54,601
- Oh. Hi, hon!
- What?

553
00:42:54,603 --> 00:42:57,303
Hey! Hey...

554
00:42:57,305 --> 00:42:58,838
She's a beauty, ain't she?

555
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,874
Darling, would you like to
join us on the veranda?

556
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:03,876
Come on, Ree, come on!

557
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:05,844
Come on out!

558
00:43:11,584 --> 00:43:13,584
Smells like a skunk.

559
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:19,824
Honey, stay out here
and celebrate with us.

560
00:43:19,826 --> 00:43:22,460
I got an offer on
the house today.

561
00:43:25,263 --> 00:43:26,763
I have homework.

562
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:47,382
Lauduree?

563
00:43:47,384 --> 00:43:48,850
Hi.

564
00:43:48,852 --> 00:43:49,951
Hi.

565
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:53,254
Are you okay?

566
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:56,257
Yeah, yeah, I'm...
it's just allergies.

567
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,892
Global warming's increasing
pollen count.

568
00:43:58,894 --> 00:44:02,596
- What have you got there?
- It's my oak.

569
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,264
I'm staying with my grandma

570
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,501
'cause my mom's out of town,
so I had to move it.

571
00:44:07,503 --> 00:44:09,336
The experiment's dead.

572
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:11,637
I'm sorry to hear that.

573
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:13,806
Do you need someplace
to plant it?

574
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:20,246
I guess we were thirsty.

575
00:44:20,248 --> 00:44:22,948
Yeah, I guess so.
The mint's from my garden.

576
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,650
I can give you a bunch
to take home.

577
00:44:25,652 --> 00:44:27,953
Also, I thought
you could use this.

578
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:31,489
Sometimes it helps to have
a camera in the field.

579
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:33,324
It's just a point-and-shoot.

580
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:05,320
Hey, if there's anything you want
from your mom's room,

581
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:07,922
take it, 'cause the rest,
goin' to Goodwill.

582
00:45:09,558 --> 00:45:11,425
Ms. Markovi...

583
00:45:11,427 --> 00:45:13,628
says that if Science Club goes
well next year,

584
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,396
she's taking a group
of us to Guatemala

585
00:45:15,398 --> 00:45:17,798
to do a community
outreach program there.

586
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,367
Is Miss Markovi paying for this?

587
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:23,303
<i>Miz. I don't know.</i>

588
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:26,706
<i>Well, why don't you ask
Miz Markovi about that</i>

589
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:29,709
before she goes booking
trips to other countries.

590
00:45:29,711 --> 00:45:31,510
Why don't you have a carwash?

591
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:32,978
I'd pay a buck for
a good carwash.

592
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,781
Carwashes poison rivers and
everything that inhabits them.

593
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:39,418
Well, lucky for you,
you're gonna be in Florida.

594
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:42,987
Aren't you going to
eat your broccoli?

595
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:45,523
- You're a crank.
- Hmm?

596
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:47,058
Nothing.

597
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,428
I-I thought you said that you
wanted to be a vegetarian!

598
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,863
No. I said...

599
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:53,997
that confined animal
feeding operations

600
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:56,333
are the largest cause
of greenhouse gases,

601
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:59,069
and that we should only buy
from small local farms.

602
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:01,071
I swear, you have
selective hearing.

603
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:03,740
<i>Do not talk to me
that way, Lauduree!</i>

604
00:46:03,742 --> 00:46:07,076
I'm really tired of this
"miss know-it-all attitude."

605
00:46:07,078 --> 00:46:08,778
Now, if you're gonna be
living in this house...

606
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,414
I didn't ask to live here!

607
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:14,417
You're right.

608
00:46:16,552 --> 00:46:18,453
Where are you going?

609
00:46:18,455 --> 00:46:19,988
It's none of your business.

610
00:47:01,494 --> 00:47:03,094
Shot of maker's.

611
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,032
Hey, you seen a girl named
Tanya in here lately?

612
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,801
She's about this tall,
blonde hair, blue eyes,

613
00:47:10,803 --> 00:47:12,937
real cute figure.

614
00:47:12,939 --> 00:47:14,404
Crystal's friend.

615
00:47:14,406 --> 00:47:16,706
That's the one.

616
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,675
Nah, I ain't seen
here in a while.

617
00:47:18,677 --> 00:47:21,411
Crystal was in here
the other night, though.

618
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:24,414
She was showing me pictures
of her chihuahua.

619
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:25,714
Lucky you.

620
00:47:25,716 --> 00:47:27,883
Them things are freaky.

621
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:54,441
<i>Hello?</i>

622
00:47:54,443 --> 00:47:56,843
Hi, is Neel home?

623
00:47:56,845 --> 00:47:59,545
<i>This is Neel.</i>

624
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:02,448
<i>Is this Lauduree?</i>

625
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:04,417
<i>- Yes.
- Hi.</i>

626
00:48:08,188 --> 00:48:12,056
Do you want to find
some pigtoes tomorrow?

627
00:48:22,134 --> 00:48:24,001
Let's get started, baby!

628
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:29,206
- Hey, Crystal!
- Whoo!

629
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:31,041
Hey!

630
00:48:31,043 --> 00:48:32,843
I need to talk to you.

631
00:48:32,845 --> 00:48:34,844
Oh, hey, Greta, I'm workin'.
You wanna come in for a drink?

632
00:48:34,846 --> 00:48:37,013
No, not really.

633
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:39,582
Are you still working
nights at the V.A.?

634
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:40,716
Like a rat in a can.

635
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:45,587
So you got a number
where she's at.

636
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,956
- Who?
- Cut the crap, Crystal...

637
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,524
'Cause you know what
I'm picturing right now?

638
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,927
I'm picturing her real high on crank.
Good lord!

639
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,895
In a horse barn turned
into a meth lab

640
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,131
with the lowlife that
you turned her on to.

641
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,766
I'm gonna go back inside, baby.

642
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:00,868
Cruiser!

643
00:49:03,171 --> 00:49:04,805
Look, Greta,

644
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:06,774
I'm in the same boat you are.

645
00:49:06,776 --> 00:49:09,242
I haven't heard from her in two weeks,
and I'm worried to death.

646
00:49:09,244 --> 00:49:12,645
I can tell when you're
lying, Crystal,

647
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:15,715
'cause you are the one that
taught Tanya how to do it.

648
00:49:15,717 --> 00:49:17,951
Oh, little ol' me, huh?

649
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:20,219
I just wanna know
if she's alive.

650
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:25,991
Okay, I'm gonna level with you.

651
00:49:27,927 --> 00:49:29,561
Ree thinks she's dead.

652
00:49:29,563 --> 00:49:33,998
She won't eat. She won't sleep.
She won't bathe.

653
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,200
She quit goin' to school.

654
00:49:36,202 --> 00:49:39,103
I been thinkin' about
goin' to a psychiatrist.

655
00:49:39,105 --> 00:49:41,739
Now, where am I gonna get
that kind of money?

656
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:43,006
Shit!

657
00:49:44,942 --> 00:49:47,210
Told her she should have
just let me take her.

658
00:49:47,212 --> 00:49:50,080
She wrote me some
dumb-ass letter.

659
00:49:50,082 --> 00:49:51,948
It broke her heart, Greta,

660
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,283
honest to god, but you gotta
try and be proud of her.

661
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:57,019
She thinks she's doing
something right in her life.

662
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:05,860
You know how old I was
when I had my first beer?

663
00:50:05,862 --> 00:50:07,629
12.

664
00:50:08,764 --> 00:50:10,265
You know where I was?

665
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:12,100
Your basement.

666
00:50:12,102 --> 00:50:13,635
Hey, I know your daddy.

667
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:15,837
There wasn't any shortage
at your place.

668
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:50,801
No pigtoes.

669
00:50:50,803 --> 00:50:52,670
No pigtoes here, either.

670
00:50:54,139 --> 00:50:57,241
Gotta find a spot
with deeper water.

671
00:50:57,243 --> 00:50:58,742
Did you read that somewhere?

672
00:50:58,744 --> 00:51:00,044
No.

673
00:51:01,012 --> 00:51:03,346
But pigtoes need fish
to reproduce.

674
00:51:03,348 --> 00:51:06,215
It was too shallow over
there for fish to swim.

675
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:09,986
You gotta get in.

676
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:13,956
It's just water.

677
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:29,103
- I found one.
- Where?

678
00:51:30,772 --> 00:51:32,306
- Just kidding!
- Hey!

679
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:36,177
All right, stop, stop, stop.

680
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:38,912
You're gonna make
the water cloudy.

681
00:51:38,914 --> 00:51:41,348
Look! I found one!

682
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:42,983
Really?

683
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,088
Don't touch it!

684
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:52,658
You need a permit.

685
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,759
Oh.

686
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,130
He's dug in there.

687
00:51:58,132 --> 00:52:00,965
That's it.

688
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:02,300
I think I got it.

689
00:52:02,302 --> 00:52:04,869
There's no way you're
catching up with me.

690
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:22,285
Do you want to go in?

691
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,087
No.

692
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:28,024
Should we wait here
till your mom gets back?

693
00:52:28,026 --> 00:52:31,093
My mom ran away.

694
00:52:31,095 --> 00:52:32,662
What do you mean?

695
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:35,830
I mean she packed up her
stuff and drove away.

696
00:52:35,832 --> 00:52:37,932
I thought you said your mo...
I lied.

697
00:52:38,964 --> 00:52:41,586
I didn't want you to make a big
deal about the whole thing.

698
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,444
We moved here when I was 5.

699
00:52:50,446 --> 00:52:53,747
This was our first
house together.

700
00:52:53,749 --> 00:52:56,916
Before that, we lived
at my grandma's.

701
00:52:56,918 --> 00:52:58,418
Is that where you live now?

702
00:53:01,855 --> 00:53:04,090
What about your dad?

703
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:08,760
He was a business
student at Rend Lake.

704
00:53:08,762 --> 00:53:12,731
He was killed in a motorcycle
crash when I was 2.

705
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:15,100
I never met him.

706
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:20,705
Will you take my picture?

707
00:54:58,363 --> 00:55:00,396
Jesus!

708
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:01,531
Ree!

709
00:55:03,232 --> 00:55:05,200
You scared me.

710
00:55:06,402 --> 00:55:09,838
Lauduree.

711
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,206
Lauduree.

712
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,142
Honey.

713
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,145
Come on, you gotta wake up.

714
00:55:18,147 --> 00:55:20,314
You fell asleep in the kitchen.

715
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:25,152
For Pete's sake.

716
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:26,853
Fine. I don't care.

717
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:32,058
What you drinkin'?

718
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,527
A beer.

719
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:36,863
How come?

720
00:55:36,865 --> 00:55:38,597
Well, 'cause I like it.

721
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:40,966
What are you doing up
past your bedtime?

722
00:55:40,968 --> 00:55:42,334
You said I could.

723
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:46,171
I don't recall that.

724
00:55:46,173 --> 00:55:48,307
You said it was a new
first date rule.

725
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:51,242
Lauduree, I don't know
what you're talking about.

726
00:55:51,244 --> 00:55:52,543
<i>Mom.</i>

727
00:55:57,282 --> 00:55:59,617
Remember that guy you
dated when I was 9?

728
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:02,886
He was bald and had a ponytail?

729
00:56:02,888 --> 00:56:04,888
Good french inhale.

730
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,424
Jim Polecock.

731
00:56:07,426 --> 00:56:09,526
Yeah, that's right.

732
00:56:09,528 --> 00:56:13,128
He called Crystal Betty Grable,

733
00:56:13,486 --> 00:56:15,516
- and you Gene Tierney.
- I didn't know that.

734
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:17,867
Yeah, 'cause you were
both beautiful.

735
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:21,637
But Crystal was an airhead,
and you were tragic.

736
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:23,938
God, if he only knew.

737
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,108
And he called Gigi Bette.
Bette for...

738
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,911
- Bette Davis?
- Yeah.

739
00:56:29,913 --> 00:56:31,012
Huh.

740
00:56:33,582 --> 00:56:36,917
Hey, do you remember
the nursing home?

741
00:56:36,919 --> 00:56:38,018
Yeah.

742
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,519
They kicked you out, though,

743
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,588
'cause you made all the old
ladies look like movie stars.

744
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,458
God, they loved her there.

745
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,559
That was a great job,

746
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:48,227
and you know,
I got her that job.

747
00:56:48,229 --> 00:56:51,163
She was at her best then.

748
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:54,033
Think you'll ever get married?

749
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:57,602
No.

750
00:56:58,938 --> 00:57:00,572
Why?

751
00:57:00,574 --> 00:57:03,408
'Cause I stay up late,
and they get up early.

752
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,243
Well, that's sorta dumb.

753
00:57:05,245 --> 00:57:08,346
Yeah, well...

754
00:57:08,348 --> 00:57:10,147
I don't trust men.

755
00:57:10,149 --> 00:57:11,415
Why not?

756
00:57:15,353 --> 00:57:17,421
I met a bad one once.

757
00:57:19,157 --> 00:57:21,291
He kind of ruined the rest.

758
00:57:26,997 --> 00:57:29,966
All right, come on.

759
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:32,167
Gotta get you up to bed.

760
00:57:32,169 --> 00:57:33,936
It's okay.

761
00:57:34,387 --> 00:57:36,200
It's grandma. It's Gigi.

762
00:57:37,057 --> 00:57:38,882
- Gigi?
- Yeah.

763
00:57:41,544 --> 00:57:43,177
Is mom here?

764
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:45,179
No, honey.

765
00:57:45,181 --> 00:57:47,281
I... I was just talking to her.

766
00:57:47,283 --> 00:57:49,383
Where'd she go?

767
00:57:49,385 --> 00:57:52,186
It's just me.

768
00:57:52,188 --> 00:57:53,521
It's all right. Come on.

769
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:55,288
We came down here
in the kitchen,

770
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,090
we had a nice little talk.

771
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,528
Your momma used to sleepwalk.

772
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:04,197
I used to find her
all around this house.

773
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:05,999
It's all right, honey.

774
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:27,085
You know, it's gonna be okay.

775
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,487
We just gotta tough it out.

776
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:41,497
What if we never see her again?

777
00:58:49,574 --> 00:58:51,640
I want her to come back.

778
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:57,200
<i>Hello?</i>

779
00:59:59,203 --> 01:00:00,470
<i>Hello?</i>

780
01:00:15,251 --> 01:00:17,652
<i>Hey hey! What's
the banana, Popsicle?</i>

781
01:00:17,654 --> 01:00:19,754
I can't do it, Ed.

782
01:00:19,756 --> 01:00:22,657
<i>Darling, I'm on the green here
with lamb and the doc.</i>

783
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:24,524
<i>Can I call you back
this evenin'?</i>

784
01:00:24,526 --> 01:00:27,527
I can't uproot her again...

785
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:31,631
and I am through with
this long-distance stuff,

786
01:00:31,633 --> 01:00:34,801
<i>- so we're breaking up.
- Can I call you tonight?</i>

787
01:00:34,803 --> 01:00:37,703
<i>- No, I'm working tonight.
- Call me when you get off.</i>

788
01:00:37,705 --> 01:00:39,805
<i>- You'll be sleeping.
- I'll wake up!</i>

789
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,141
You always say that, Ed,
and you never do it.

790
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:43,542
<i>I will this time!</i>

791
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:47,779
<i>Listen, I am trying to find a time
when I can give you my...</i>

792
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:50,148
I am breaking up with you!

793
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:18,828
- Made coffee.
- Wonderful.

794
01:02:20,631 --> 01:02:22,265
Want some eggs?

795
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:24,701
Hon, I don't have
my stomach yet.

796
01:02:28,773 --> 01:02:30,606
I called the realtor,

797
01:02:30,608 --> 01:02:32,608
turned down the offer
on the house.

798
01:02:33,777 --> 01:02:36,212
We're not moving to Florida.

799
01:02:38,715 --> 01:02:41,449
Is Ed moving in with us?

800
01:02:41,451 --> 01:02:43,718
I'm sick of Ed.

801
01:02:45,788 --> 01:02:47,622
Thought everything
was going good.

802
01:02:47,624 --> 01:02:50,291
Same as it's always been.

803
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:55,596
Do you know that we had to go

804
01:02:55,598 --> 01:02:57,864
in front of the 'Queens
of Owensboro'

805
01:02:57,866 --> 01:03:00,367
to get a blessing for this move?

806
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:02,769
Who are the Queens of Owensboro?

807
01:03:02,771 --> 01:03:04,804
Ed's daughters.

808
01:03:04,806 --> 01:03:06,539
They practically disowned him

809
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:09,642
<i>when he even thought of buying
me an engagement ring.</i>

810
01:03:09,644 --> 01:03:12,245
He is spineless.

811
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:14,680
That sucks.

812
01:03:14,682 --> 01:03:17,549
Yeah, it does. It sucks.

813
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:19,684
But it was my own goddamn fault

814
01:03:19,686 --> 01:03:22,254
for thinking that this
was gonna work out.

815
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:27,358
There's a reason we've been
long-distance for 10 years.

816
01:03:28,593 --> 01:03:30,594
But you know what?

817
01:03:30,596 --> 01:03:31,996
You make your bed.

818
01:03:37,936 --> 01:03:40,703
Your mom, when she was pregnant,

819
01:03:40,705 --> 01:03:43,706
she begged me to
have an abortion,

820
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:46,309
and I said over my dead body

821
01:03:46,311 --> 01:03:47,977
because I thought a child
would teach her

822
01:03:47,979 --> 01:03:51,513
how to take care of herself.

823
01:03:51,515 --> 01:03:52,948
What a joke!

824
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,884
She blows town,
leaves you with me.

825
01:04:00,356 --> 01:04:02,957
Poetic justice.
Isn't that what they call it?

826
01:04:03,859 --> 01:04:05,793
Isn't that what you get?

827
01:05:50,057 --> 01:05:51,823
Where are you going?

828
01:05:51,825 --> 01:05:54,426
Okay, I think it might be...

829
01:05:54,428 --> 01:05:55,793
I think I left it on...

830
01:05:55,795 --> 01:05:57,628
Lauduree.

831
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,530
What are you doing here?

832
01:05:59,532 --> 01:06:02,700
How... how did you get in here?

833
01:06:02,702 --> 01:06:05,136
Neel and I found
the crescent pigtoe.

834
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:07,537
Laudur, how did you
get into my house?

835
01:06:07,539 --> 01:06:08,705
What's wrong?

836
01:06:08,707 --> 01:06:11,074
This is my student, Lauduree.

837
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:13,176
Lauduree, this is
my husband, Paul.

838
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:15,145
Hi. Maybe you could
get us some water.

839
01:06:15,147 --> 01:06:16,179
Sure.

840
01:06:25,755 --> 01:06:27,856
You in trouble?

841
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,758
We found the pigtoe in a
stream near little grassy.

842
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,094
Okay. That's great.

843
01:06:33,096 --> 01:06:34,996
It's not extinct,
so we could breed it

844
01:06:34,998 --> 01:06:38,566
and reintroduce it
to a bigger river.

845
01:06:38,568 --> 01:06:40,435
Lauduree.

846
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,770
Florida was a lie.

847
01:06:43,772 --> 01:06:45,205
What do you mean?

848
01:06:45,207 --> 01:06:48,575
I mean my mom's not taking
me there on vacation.

849
01:06:48,577 --> 01:06:51,478
She moved to California.

850
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,012
Oh.

851
01:06:53,014 --> 01:06:56,182
You know?
Your grandmother came to school.

852
01:06:56,184 --> 01:06:58,017
She's very worried about you.

853
01:06:58,019 --> 01:06:59,985
I can't stay with her.

854
01:06:59,987 --> 01:07:01,687
Did something happen?

855
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:04,756
I thought I could
live here for a while.

856
01:07:04,758 --> 01:07:08,059
You're the only one who gets
what's going on in the world.

857
01:07:08,061 --> 01:07:10,528
I am not equipped
to deal with this.

858
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,697
Let me get you someone
to talk to, okay?

859
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:14,566
I don't need someone to talk to.

860
01:07:14,568 --> 01:07:17,501
I need a place to stay.

861
01:07:17,503 --> 01:07:19,903
You don't have any kids.

862
01:07:19,905 --> 01:07:23,106
No, actually, we're
expecting a baby.

863
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,225
You trying to get
yourself killed?

864
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:45,560
Your car's already
doing the job, asshole!

865
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:49,064
And your selfish,
ignorant oil addiction!

866
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:52,933
What are you lookin' at, huh?

867
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:54,935
Are you ready for
23 feet of water

868
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:56,670
flooding the eastern seaboard?

869
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:59,907
You ready for refugees camping
out in your backyard?

870
01:08:02,676 --> 01:08:04,944
What do you think the
future's gonna look like?

871
01:08:04,946 --> 01:08:06,246
Tropical paradise?

872
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,248
Think it's gonna be
nice and warm?

873
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,116
Hell, there's not
gonna be any food.

874
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:13,285
Welcome to my future.

875
01:08:16,089 --> 01:08:18,624
This is part of our problem!

876
01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:20,025
Do you really need to buy

877
01:08:20,027 --> 01:08:23,562
a new plastic water bottle
every day of your life?

878
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:26,531
It's made from oil,
the same stuff that gushed

879
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:28,099
into the Gulf of Mexico,

880
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:30,568
while we all just stood around.

881
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:31,570
Lauduree.

882
01:08:32,604 --> 01:08:35,606
You are a hypocrite!

883
01:08:35,608 --> 01:08:37,941
Why would you want to bring
a child into this world?

884
01:08:37,943 --> 01:08:40,610
It's cruel, and you know it.

885
01:08:40,612 --> 01:08:42,312
I was born with
a mother and a father,

886
01:08:42,314 --> 01:08:44,614
and I don't know
where they went.

887
01:08:44,616 --> 01:08:47,117
And that's how your kids
are gonna feel

888
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:48,884
when the shit hits the fan.

889
01:08:48,886 --> 01:08:51,620
Lauduree!

890
01:08:51,622 --> 01:08:52,988
It's time to come home.

891
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:54,990
I'm not getting in that car.

892
01:08:54,992 --> 01:08:56,659
It's poison.

893
01:08:56,661 --> 01:08:58,060
<i>You're poison.</i>

894
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:01,884
Hello?

895
01:10:01,886 --> 01:10:04,253
<i>Hey. Is Greta there?</i>

896
01:10:06,857 --> 01:10:08,123
One second.

897
01:10:19,068 --> 01:10:22,770
Um... she's in the bathtub.

898
01:10:22,772 --> 01:10:25,072
Can I take a message?

899
01:10:25,074 --> 01:10:27,274
<i>She hasn't picked up
for three days.</i>

900
01:10:29,077 --> 01:10:32,345
<i>You, uh... you okay?</i>

901
01:10:32,347 --> 01:10:33,680
Yeah.

902
01:11:09,747 --> 01:11:11,348
<i>Not going to do that anymore.</i>

903
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,916
<i>I'm tired of being half here.</i>

904
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:15,052
<i>I'm tired of putting
my life on hold!</i>

905
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:33,368

Why are you wearing makeup?

915
01:12:06,867 --> 01:12:08,800
It's an experiment.

916
01:12:08,802 --> 01:12:10,168
What kind of experiment?

917
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:13,071
To see whether people
will treat me differently.

918
01:12:13,073 --> 01:12:14,438
Are they?

919
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,074
You're the first
person I've seen.

920
01:12:17,076 --> 01:12:20,311
Do you want people to
treat you differently?

921
01:12:20,313 --> 01:12:21,846
That would be bias.

922
01:12:21,848 --> 01:12:24,782
I can't introduce bias
into my experiment.

923
01:12:27,184 --> 01:12:29,986
Do you think I'm attractive?

924
01:12:29,988 --> 01:12:31,254
Yeah.

925
01:12:34,091 --> 01:12:36,292
Do you think you could
like me forever?

926
01:12:37,894 --> 01:12:39,161
Probably.

927
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:44,500
Then for the experiment,
I need you to kiss me.

928
01:12:45,902 --> 01:12:47,770
Okay.

929
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:57,111
I still have that feeling.

930
01:12:57,113 --> 01:12:58,446
Where is it?

931
01:12:58,448 --> 01:12:59,913
In my chest.

932
01:12:59,915 --> 01:13:02,115
What does it feel like?

933
01:13:02,117 --> 01:13:04,351
Tight and panicky.

934
01:13:04,353 --> 01:13:06,553
It's like I have no future.

935
01:13:11,124 --> 01:13:13,292
Everything's your future.

936
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:15,828
Right this second is.

937
01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:21,333
Can I kiss you,
to see if that has a result?

938
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,364
Oh, my god!

939
01:14:32,366 --> 01:14:34,533
My baby! Come here!

940
01:14:34,535 --> 01:14:36,435
Ohh...!

941
01:14:36,437 --> 01:14:40,305
I came back for you, Ree!

942
01:14:40,307 --> 01:14:42,974
I came back for you!

943
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:51,449
Shh. Shh.

944
01:14:51,451 --> 01:14:53,651
Let me look at you.

945
01:14:53,653 --> 01:14:56,920
You're a real lady now,
aren't you?

946
01:14:56,922 --> 01:15:00,323
Feels like you've been
gone for a year.

947
01:15:00,325 --> 01:15:03,526
Well, time moves
slowly when you're little.

948
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:07,463
I had to give up my project.

949
01:15:07,465 --> 01:15:09,331
We'll just...
we'll start a new one

950
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:11,033
just as soon as you
get home, okay?

951
01:15:11,035 --> 01:15:12,468
It's too late.

952
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:15,938
Ree, you're gonna be
so proud of me.

953
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:18,606
I've found us a place
by the beach,

954
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:20,575
in San Diego.

955
01:15:20,577 --> 01:15:22,610
With a patio for your plants.

956
01:15:22,612 --> 01:15:24,445
And it's real close to school,
so you can walk

957
01:15:24,447 --> 01:15:25,947
without having to take the bus,

958
01:15:25,949 --> 01:15:27,582
just like you're
always talking about.

959
01:15:27,584 --> 01:15:30,617
And there is nature
everywhere in California.

960
01:15:30,619 --> 01:15:33,153
Sound good?

961
01:15:33,155 --> 01:15:34,521
Yeah?

962
01:15:34,523 --> 01:15:36,490
Okay.

963
01:15:36,492 --> 01:15:38,258
All right, will you just
help me up now?

964
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,359
Okay. Okay.

965
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:43,095
Okay, we gotta hustle,
though, okay?

966
01:15:43,097 --> 01:15:45,631
Will you... will you just close
up that back right there?

967
01:15:45,633 --> 01:15:48,467
Just give it a real good shove.

968
01:15:48,469 --> 01:15:50,603
I was puttin' that TV
in the back,

969
01:15:50,605 --> 01:15:52,704
and just as I was jumping out,

970
01:15:52,706 --> 01:15:54,706
I thought I shouldn't
leave it loose like that.

971
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:58,076
It'll roll all around,
and I landed right on my ankle.

972
01:15:58,078 --> 01:15:59,377
Ohh!

973
01:15:59,379 --> 01:16:01,379
I just gotta think for a second.

974
01:16:01,381 --> 01:16:03,514
Maybe you should take a nap.

975
01:16:03,516 --> 01:16:06,183
A nap?

976
01:16:06,185 --> 01:16:07,384
Oh, god.

977
01:16:07,386 --> 01:16:10,187
We have to go, Ree!

978
01:16:10,189 --> 01:16:12,656
What am I gonna do?

979
01:16:12,658 --> 01:16:16,726
I killed it.

980
01:16:16,728 --> 01:16:18,361
Just until Missouri.

981
01:16:18,363 --> 01:16:21,364
Rooster! Rooster! Rooster!

982
01:16:21,366 --> 01:16:24,400
Are you ready for
a whole new life, Ree?

983
01:16:24,402 --> 01:16:26,668
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

984
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,537
All right, you've got it in park.

985
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:31,373
Now, let's turn that key.

986
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:33,742
That's it!

987
01:16:34,978 --> 01:16:36,712
Now... put it in reverse.

988
01:16:38,213 --> 01:16:40,214
Yeah, just take your
foot off the brake.

989
01:16:40,216 --> 01:16:42,583
- You got it, Ree!
- Whoo-hoo!

990
01:16:48,756 --> 01:16:52,158
See ya, suckers!
Wouldn't wanna be you!

991
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,493
Au revoir!

992
01:16:53,495 --> 01:16:55,295
♪ I woke up

993
01:16:55,297 --> 01:16:57,630

994
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:01,166

999

01:17:16,249 --> 01:17:18,349
♪ peace signs ♪

1001
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:21,452
Okay, I'll be just a minute.

1002
01:17:21,454 --> 01:17:23,420
You be good.

1003
01:17:48,712 --> 01:17:51,379
What was that? - Oh, yeah, you
know, it just started doing that,

1004
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:52,814
So I thought we could
take it to, um,

1005
01:17:52,816 --> 01:17:54,482
this friend of mine,
just on the way out of town...

1006
01:17:54,484 --> 01:17:55,617
- who fixes cars.
- Mm-hmm.

1007
01:17:55,619 --> 01:17:57,352
It probably just needs some oil.

1008
01:17:57,354 --> 01:17:59,319
You know I'm an idiot when it
comes to that kind of stuff.

1009
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:01,288
Oh, my god!

1010
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,624
So guess who's gonna help
me pay for beauty school?

1011
01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:05,559
Mom, I don't know if
we should keep going.

1012
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,761
My dad! I met my dad!

1013
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:10,163
Thought no one knew
where he was.

1014
01:18:12,433 --> 01:18:15,368
He's got a whole new family.

1015
01:18:16,404 --> 01:18:19,205
- Forgot his daughter, Ree!
- Mom.

1016
01:18:19,207 --> 01:18:22,774
Mom, I need you to focus. I need
you to tell me what to do. Mom!

1017
01:18:22,776 --> 01:18:24,576
You need to cut her, Ree. Brake.

1018
01:18:24,578 --> 01:18:26,812
- I'm trying.
- Well, turn off, turn off.

1019
01:18:26,814 --> 01:18:28,847
Right here. Easy!

1020
01:18:31,652 --> 01:18:35,119
Goddamn it! What am I
supposed to do now?

1021
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:37,221
Call a tow truck.

1022
01:18:37,223 --> 01:18:39,223
I can't afford a tow truck.

1023
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,228
What was the $300 for, then?

1024
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:48,098
To get back to California!

1025
01:18:56,473 --> 01:18:58,207
Give me your phone.

1026
01:18:58,209 --> 01:19:00,542
No, let's just wait
for somebody to stop.

1027
01:19:00,544 --> 01:19:03,512
Give me your phone. I know
someone who can help us.

1028
01:19:30,203 --> 01:19:34,540
I'm at the juncture
of 29 and 70.

1029
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:40,512
Who was that?

1030
01:19:40,514 --> 01:19:41,713
It's fine.

1031
01:19:41,715 --> 01:19:44,182
You should stay off your foot.

1032
01:20:04,601 --> 01:20:06,602
California is beautiful, Ree.

1033
01:20:06,604 --> 01:20:08,304
You're gonna love it.

1034
01:20:11,608 --> 01:20:14,343
There's palm trees everywhere.

1035
01:20:14,345 --> 01:20:16,912
The beach is real close by.

1036
01:20:19,615 --> 01:20:21,550
I'm gonna get a convertible.

1037
01:20:22,752 --> 01:20:24,920
Custom-painted to match the sky.

1038
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,622
Why didn't you tell me
about the truck?

1039
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,328
Because I wanted everything
to be perfect

1040
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,829
when I came to get you.

1041
01:21:25,508 --> 01:21:27,376
Let's go.

1042
01:21:27,378 --> 01:21:29,478
<i>Did you call her, Lauduree?</i>

1043
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,413
Look, do not put this on her!

1044
01:21:31,415 --> 01:21:33,549
Get in the car!
Just stop ordering me around!

1045
01:21:33,551 --> 01:21:36,384
I would love to leave you by
the side of the road, Tanya.

1046
01:21:36,386 --> 01:21:37,652
It's up to you.

1047
01:21:37,654 --> 01:21:38,853
Just let me make a phone call.

1048
01:21:38,855 --> 01:21:41,756
<i>- I am not waiting.
- Just wait!</i>

1049
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,295
Jesus Christ!

1050
01:21:51,432 --> 01:21:53,834
I swear to god, Tanya.

1051
01:21:53,836 --> 01:21:55,836
There is something
wrong with you.

1052
01:21:55,838 --> 01:21:57,671
I don't know whether I should call
the police department...

1053
01:21:57,673 --> 01:22:00,039
or the psych unit! Well, there's
no need to call anybody...

1054
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:02,408
'cause I came to get
my daughter!

1055
01:22:03,944 --> 01:22:06,946
Well, what happened to you
out there, anyway, huh?

1056
01:22:06,948 --> 01:22:08,948
Did you lose all your cash?

1057
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:11,449
You down to your
last plug nickel?

1058
01:22:11,451 --> 01:22:13,351
Get outta the car, Lauduree.

1059
01:22:16,856 --> 01:22:18,690
Give these to your Ma.

1060
01:22:22,527 --> 01:22:24,862
Lauduree, maybe you can tell me

1061
01:22:24,864 --> 01:22:27,464
why you were a half a mile away

1062
01:22:27,466 --> 01:22:29,400
from the gold post pawn shop.

1063
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:32,802
Just tell her, mom.
She's gonna find out, anyways.

1064
01:22:34,763 --> 01:22:38,122
I found a diamond ring in an ashtray
in the bathroom, and I sold it.

1065
01:22:41,445 --> 01:22:42,879
Lauduree, go upstairs.

1066
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:46,014
Go upstairs!

1067
01:22:46,016 --> 01:22:47,449
Ree, I love you.

1068
01:22:47,451 --> 01:22:49,318
Jesus Christ, mom.

1069
01:23:02,397 --> 01:23:04,999
Did you just think that was just,
like, some bauble?

1070
01:23:05,001 --> 01:23:07,767
<i>From my bathroom?</i>

1071
01:23:07,769 --> 01:23:09,769
<i>- What is...?
- Stay out of my life!</i>

1072
01:23:09,771 --> 01:23:12,572
<i>I did not ask you to come
back here, did I?</i>

1073
01:23:12,574 --> 01:23:14,407
<i>I did not ask to come back here!</i>

1074
01:23:14,409 --> 01:23:15,775
<i>Well, then, why are you here?</i>

1075
01:23:15,777 --> 01:23:18,477
<i>Because she called you!
I told her not to.</i>

1076
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:19,945
<i>I said I didn't need you!
I didn't want to be here!</i>

1077
01:23:19,947 --> 01:23:23,415
<i>Somebody in the family
has a brain.</i>

1078
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:27,920
Do you know that every
barfly in Jackson County

1079
01:23:27,922 --> 01:23:30,922
wants to be a makeup artist,
don't they?

1080
01:23:30,924 --> 01:23:33,091
But they have something
you don't, Tanya.

1081
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:36,828
See, you're just saying that
because you hate me.

1082
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:39,130
I don't hate you!

1083
01:23:39,132 --> 01:23:43,867
Tanya, you're just...
missing something.

1084
01:23:43,869 --> 01:23:46,403
I have tried for years
to give it to you.

1085
01:23:46,405 --> 01:23:48,505
I just don't know what
to do anymore.

1086
01:23:48,507 --> 01:23:53,042
The more you tell her that,
the more she believes it.

1087
01:23:53,044 --> 01:23:56,445
Okay, Ree, um, why don't you
go up and pack up your stuff,

1088
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:59,515
'cause we're gonna sleep
at Crystal's tonight.

1089
01:24:00,617 --> 01:24:02,451
I'm not going with you.

1090
01:24:02,453 --> 01:24:03,786
What?

1091
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,120
I'm not going with you.

1092
01:24:06,956 --> 01:24:08,623
Okay. Now, look, baby.

1093
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:10,959
It was a mistake to leave, okay?

1094
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:12,660
I know that you're mad at me.

1095
01:24:12,662 --> 01:24:15,462
It was so, so, so selfish.

1096
01:24:15,464 --> 01:24:16,897
But now I'm back,

1097
01:24:16,899 --> 01:24:18,098
and we're gonna
have a great time

1098
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,168
and be really,
really happy together.

1099
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:24,505
I can't make you happy,
'cause it makes me a nothing,

1100
01:24:24,507 --> 01:24:25,973
it makes me a blank.

1101
01:24:25,975 --> 01:24:27,707
I'm your mom.

1102
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:29,575
Why would I make
you a... a blank?

1103
01:24:29,577 --> 01:24:30,710
What is a blank?

1104
01:24:30,712 --> 01:24:32,445
I have no idea.

1105
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:36,749
Can I go to the library?

1106
01:24:36,751 --> 01:24:38,917
Sure.

1107
01:24:38,919 --> 01:24:41,052
We're gonna be at the pawn shop.

1108
01:24:42,989 --> 01:24:45,123
I'm not giving up.

1109
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:47,793
I'm gonna be right here
when you get back, Ree.

1110
01:24:50,495 --> 01:24:51,662
Okay.

1111
01:24:51,664 --> 01:24:54,131
- Now give me a kiss.
- Okay.

1112
01:24:56,735 --> 01:24:59,537
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1113
01:27:47,257 --> 01:27:51,860
I was about two minutes
away from calling the cops.

1114
01:27:51,862 --> 01:27:53,127
I'm sorry.

1115
01:27:57,032 --> 01:27:59,033
Your mom went out with Crystal.

1116
01:27:59,035 --> 01:28:01,736
She said she'd be back
to tuck you in.

1117
01:28:01,738 --> 01:28:03,338
Believe it when you see it.

1118
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:07,307
What happened?

1119
01:28:10,945 --> 01:28:12,646
I stood by you.

1120
01:28:14,849 --> 01:28:16,616
What'd she say?

1121
01:28:18,051 --> 01:28:21,120
I told her I would take her to court,
if need be.

1122
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:26,192
You know, I had a feeling

1123
01:28:26,194 --> 01:28:29,361
that goddamn,
no-good son of a bitch.

1124
01:28:32,798 --> 01:28:34,165
Well...

1125
01:28:35,401 --> 01:28:38,136

Who knows?

1127
01:28:52,883 --> 01:28:54,217
I would have paid cash money

01:28:56,021 --> 01:28:59,155
When he opened up the door,
there she was.

01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:03,892
That man was so stingy

1131
01:29:03,894 --> 01:29:05,827
that if he'd give you
a cigarette

1132
01:29:05,829 --> 01:29:07,996
and you didn't smoke it
right down to the filter,

1133
01:29:07,998 --> 01:29:10,766
he'd go pick it out of the
ashtray and suck on it,

1134
01:29:10,768 --> 01:29:13,035
and suck it like he
was suckin' lemons!

1135
01:29:17,739 --> 01:29:21,375

a little bit since then.
