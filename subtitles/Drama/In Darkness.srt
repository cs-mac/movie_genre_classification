2
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,599
Szczepek!

3
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,719
Leave it.

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,519
Shine the light.

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,999
Tell them there's nothing of value here!

6
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,679
He says his parents left nothing behind.

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,399
- What are you doing with this Kraut?
- None of your business!

8
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,599
- Hands up, Polack pig!
- Shoot!

9
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,839
Go on!

10
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,679
Shoot!

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,799
Go ahead, shoot!

12
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,439
Get yourself a Polish man to fuck!

13
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,719
Where were you?

14
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,919
A blocked pipe.

15
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,399
Was it blocked with chickens?

16
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,399
She needs fresh fruit or
she'll be coughing until summer.

17
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,999
Fresh fruit?

18
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,839
At her age I didn't even know
what an orange was.

19
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,599
At her age you were living
on the street.

20
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,799
Leave her alone, will you?

21
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,199
Leave her be!

22
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,119
- We need to get up.
- It's Sunday.

23
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,999
- I have to go to Mass.
- There's still time.

24
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,559
No tickling!

25
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,519
Stop that, you fool!

26
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,679
Something bit me.

27
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,079
- Can you see anything?
- What?

28
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,119
I can't see a thing.

29
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,719
It itches terribly. Scratch me, Poldek.

30
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,999
Quiet!

31
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,519
You'll wake Stefcia!

32
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,559
IN DARKNESS

33
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,679
You're making too much noise!

34
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,359
Get the ladder.

35
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,759
Come on, get over here!
Go on, hurry up, move on!

36
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,359
Dance!

37
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,799
Put your hands up. Up!

38
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,359
Hold him down.

39
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,719
Say cheese...

40
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,199
Klara...

41
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,679
Give him 200.

42
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,239
See you next week.

43
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,719
- Hello.
- Hello, Szczepek.

44
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,199
Hey, Yid!

45
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,799
What is it?

46
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,239
That's for the fake engagement ring
you sold me.

47
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,719
Marysia is expecting a nice present
for her Saints' Day.

48
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,399
Give her a good fuck
and be done with it.

49
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,919
I'm serious.

50
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,519
- We have to sell this shit.
- Not now, the market's bad.

51
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,119
This shit's worth nothing right now.

52
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,519
You can buy decent jewelry
from a Yid for a few sausages.

53
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,319
- Patience, Szczepek.
- Patience?

54
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,159
Marysia's going to leave me.
Aleksy, this new neighbor of hers...

55
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,879
She says they're just friends,
but I'm sure the bastard's fucking her.

56
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,639
He's clever. He knows how to talk.

57
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,999
The fucking bastard!

58
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,599
Poldek...

59
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,679
I love her.

60
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,479
So beat her!
If you love a woman, beat her!

61
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,919
- Do you beat Wanda?
- She beats me!

62
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,919
You're teasing me again!

63
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,759
Hear that?

64
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,399
That...

65
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,639
- What's that?
- From the ghetto.

66
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,639
We're through!

67
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,519
We've done it!

68
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,199
The sewer is ours!

69
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,319
So we meet again.

70
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,839
It's Swiss. Take it.

71
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,199
It's worth a lot. Don't you believe me?

72
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,679
If you don't get at least 500...

73
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,319
you can turn us in.

74
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,759
We'd get more if we reported you.

75
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,239
Alright.

76
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,559
500...

77
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,799
plus the watch.

78
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,839
- 500 and the watch.
- No, no, no.

79
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,919
I'll handle it. I will go up...

80
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,559
- for the money.
- We'll come with you. Just in case.

81
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Krysia!

82
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,719
Stop it, or you'll both go back
into the closet!

83
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,839
- Paulina, what are they doing here?
- They needed some fresh air.

84
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,999
Just for a few minutes.
Don't be angry, Ignacy.

85
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,759
I'll be right back.

86
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,399
- What's your name?
- Pirate.

87
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,319
Perfect name for a thief.

88
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,719
I know the sewers better
than I know my own wife.

89
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,759
- It's no place for you.
- There is no place for us anywhere.

90
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,799
But I know places where it could work.

91
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,479
For the right price.

92
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,599
Name your price.

93
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,479
500 a day.

94
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,039
- Agreed.
- Poldek...

95
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,799
- they'll hang us.
- Listen, don't worry.

96
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,639
The young one...

97
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,439
- he's scared, he'll betray us.
- Never trust a Polack.

98
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,919
It's four against two.
We can easily finish them off.

99
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,919
We can't just kill them.

100
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,159
Why not? It's war!

101
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,119
It'll end in a massacre.
Twenty of ours for one of theirs.

102
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,919
- No one has to know.
- Forget it. We have no choice!

103
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,079
We can always turn them in later.
First let's see how much they have.

104
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,279
So, do we have a deal?

105
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,079
Here's a down payment.

106
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,679
You'll get the rest when we need you.

107
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,999
- How will we find you?
- Don't worry. I'll find you.

108
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,039
Fuck, I should've asked for more.

109
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,199
Socha?

110
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,079
Socha!

111
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,719
Bortnik!

112
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,639
My Ukrainian friend!

113
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,439
- It's been years!
- Good to see you, brother!

114
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,119
I'm a commander now.

115
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,759
Szczepek here works with me.
I know Bortnik...

116
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,639
- from Lonski!
- You were in jail?

117
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,999
- I had no choice.
- Szczepek, listen...

118
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,359
Lonski was full of sons of bitches.

119
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,399
But not Poldek. He could be trusted.

120
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,799
I will never forget it. Cheers.

121
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,519
Cheers!

122
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,239
Your best vodka for my friends!

123
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,159
You know what this means?

124
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,319
It means I can help all my friends.

125
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,079
- Even the friends of my friends.
- May I?

126
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,559
If you need anything,

127
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,399
just ask.

128
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,519
I trained near the Baltic.
They're tough mothers.

129
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,479
But the Germans are the best thing...

130
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,759
to happen to the Ukrainians.

131
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,199
The Polacks, too.

132
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,519
Cheers!

133
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,839
Poldek!

134
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,879
Janek, your wife!

135
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,319
You'll wake her up.

136
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,359
Poldek, stop pulling my leg! I went
there for a drink like a gentleman...

137
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,559
and there, on the accordion,
was Ryszek Kynczel...

138
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,359
- Was Witek Szugenia there?
- Yes, he was, I'm telling you.

139
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,639
And the Grochowiak girl,
she was there, too.

140
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,119
- So you started partying?
- Yes, I did. She's got these eyes...

141
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,159
like a little lost sheep, you know?
They look like a pair of diamonds...

142
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,719
- Krysia? Pawel?
- We're here, Mama.

143
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,319
This is my room!

144
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,439
- Go away! Stop pushing!
- Let us in!

145
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,119
Calm down, calm down!

146
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,239
Get out of my way.

147
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,719
Make way!

148
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,239
- We're not coming with you, Janek.
- What?

149
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,439
It's her or us!

150
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,039
Now is not the time...

151
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,999
Do you think I don't know
what's going on?

152
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,759
I'm not blind!
It's her or us. Choose!

153
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,119
Father...

154
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,239
Take your prize, you bitch!
Home wrecker.

155
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,719
Stop pushing!

156
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,519
Help me, please!

157
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,519
Help me please, I have a baby!

158
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,439
- Help me, please!
- Poldek, I want no part in this!

159
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,159
I've got a baby! Help me!

160
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,639
Go away!

161
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,719
Faster, come on, come on!

162
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,159
They get to go first.

163
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,319
- I'm sorry...
- Ignacy, you go first.

164
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,479
Krysia insisted on wearing
her red boots.

165
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,239
Faster! Faster!

166
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,719
- Where is our Polack Moses now?
- So much for your down payment!

167
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,999
- Ignacy!
- No, it's dark in there!

168
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,399
- Krysia, please.
- No, no!

169
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,799
You'll be fine.

170
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,999
Give me your hand, Paulina.

171
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,399
Pirate!

172
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,799
- Krysia, it'll be alright.
- Mr. Chiger, are you there?

173
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,399
Thought we weren't coming, didn't you?

174
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,639
Klara, I'm not going!

175
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,239
No, it stinks down here.

176
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,679
Get in, Mania. Now!

177
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,919
- Klara, I'm begging you, I can't!
- Mania, please, come on.

178
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,519
- Krysia, please, you must go down.
- No, no!

179
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,999
- Krysia...
- No!

180
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,999
Listen. Listen to me!

181
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,279
Listen to me!

182
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,919
You will be safe down here,
but you must stop crying, you hear?

183
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,839
Mania, you can't stay here.

184
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,879
- But we are staying!
- Mania, please!

185
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,999
- Where's your bag?
- You can't stay here.

186
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,119
Where is it?

187
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,119
- You have to come with us!
- Don't tell me what to do!

188
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,119
Make way!

189
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,119
- Mania, come on, get down there!
- No, no!

190
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,119
Let me go!

191
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,599
Klara...

192
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,839
Get down there!

193
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,599
Be careful!

194
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,079
There's shit everywhere!

195
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,679
- Come on, Mania.
- No, I'm going back.

196
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,359
Mania, come on!

197
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,759
- If we don't keep up, we'll get lost!
- I'm going back!

198
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,519
- Are you deaf? We'll get lost!
- I don't want to be here.

199
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,519
- Do you think I want to be here?
- Leave me alone!

200
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,799
- Come on!
- I want to go home!

201
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,879
I won't always be here to take
care of you! Don't be such a baby!

202
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,479
- You're no longer a child! Understand?
- Klara...

203
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,719
Stay out of this, Mundek!

204
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,479
- Come on.
- I hate you, you bitch!

205
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,079
Mania...

206
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,159
They'll kill you up there.

207
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,679
Klara, she's your sister,
the only family you have.

208
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,279
We have to hurry. Come on, please!

209
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,759
You could've brought some food instead!

210
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,319
Can't we rest for a few minutes?

211
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,639
When I say so!

212
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,999
Children first.

213
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,399
Fucking hell.

214
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,519
Everyone and their dog came down!
Bunch of lice.

215
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,839
Out of the way.

216
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,719
Out of the way!

217
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,079
Get away!

218
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,839
Make room for the children!
Mrs. Chiger, over here.

219
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,719
Sit down, Pawel.

220
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,639
You will stay here for now.

221
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,799
It's so dirty in here.

222
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,079
- I'm thirsty.
- They suck out all the air!

223
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,119
Szczepek!

224
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,599
Come...

225
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,279
- Stop, Yid, or I'll shoot!
- Don't shoot!

226
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,839
I'm not a Yid!

227
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,479
- I know Bortnik. He's my friend.
- Hands up!

228
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,599
- Antoni's in the ghetto.
- All Ukrainians are my friends.

229
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,879
- Come on, we'll check it.
- Keep your hands up!

230
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,799
Left here!

231
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,479
Hey, Bortnik, this guy says
he knows you.

232
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,199
He's okay.

233
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,399
Let him go.

234
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,119
- Socha, what are you doing here?
- I work here. The sewer was blocked.

235
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,719
You're lucky they found me.

236
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,679
See any Jews down there?

237
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,639
Just bodies. They caused the blockage.

238
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,719
- Tell me if you find any live ones.
- Absolutely!

239
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,639
- It's our duty.
- Yes.

240
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,439
Herr Officer!

241
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,079
Watch out!

242
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,079
You look like hell.

243
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,079
Hard day at work.

244
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,919
If you like, I'll draw you a bath.

245
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,399
Did you hear it?

246
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,199
I doubt if there's anything
left of the ghetto.

247
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,399
Did you see anything?

248
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,919
Those poor people.

249
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,359
They're offering rewards
for turning in Jews.

250
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,879
Some people are making a pile.

251
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,359
God will punish the greedy.

252
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,399
The Jews crucified Jesus.

253
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,759
It's written in the Bible:

254
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,559
"His blood be upon them and
their children." The priest said so.

255
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,559
That's just church politics.

256
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,919
Just think about it.

257
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,639
Jews are just the same as us.

258
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,239
Our Lady and the apostles,
they're all Jews!

259
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,519
Even Jesus.

260
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,719
Jesus?

261
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,919
Mania...

262
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,279
Have you seen Mania?

263
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,799
Mania. Have you seen Mania?

264
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,559
Has anyone seen Mania?

265
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,359
Is Mania your sister?

266
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,079
She stepped on me as she was leaving.

267
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,559
She left?

268
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,599
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

269
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,199
She was crying.

270
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,639
Said she didn't want to die here.

271
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,879
I must...

272
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,159
I must find her.

273
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,919
Klara...

274
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,359
- You can't go out there!
- I must find her!

275
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,559
Where is she?

276
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,919
Klara...

277
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,639
Where is she?

278
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,999
Go and find her!

279
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,439
Find her.

280
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,199
Having a party, Mr. Socha?

281
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,679
Some sausages.

282
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,839
Good morning.

283
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,679
440 zlotys.

284
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,799
Really? That's steep!

285
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,319
Onions are ten zlotys.

286
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,199
Last week they were five!

287
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,439
You can afford it, Mr. Socha.

288
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,399
A week ago your wife...

289
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,519
had no cash and now
suddenly you're shopping...

290
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,199
for an army.

291
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,399
Basia, do you want some candy?

292
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,559
Smartass.

293
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,039
I love you.

294
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,039
Listen to this nonsense
from Mr. Goebbels...

295
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,439
"Our heroes in the East will prevail
over the Bolsheviks and Jews...

296
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,639
in the steppes."

297
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,359
And get slaughtered in Stalingrad!

298
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,879
I never thought I'd miss the ghetto.

299
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,039
Unbelievable, isn't it?

300
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,919
You're welcome to go back!

301
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,239
Be quiet!

302
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,559
The Germans are losing, that's obvious.
You have to read between the lines.

303
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,599
- The Germans...
- Mr. Chiger, we all know...

304
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,079
you speak their fucking language.

305
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,759
The language of Heinrich Heine.
You should learn it.

306
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,439
But I suppose in your view ignorance
is bliss. Right, Mr. Grossmann?

307
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,119
I've brought food.

308
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,039
Take it easy, calm down!

309
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,679
Stop it! Stop pushing!

310
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,759
- That's ours!
- Stay calm!

311
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,279
- Calm down, you'll kill each other!
- That's our bread!

312
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,919
Take it easy I said.

313
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,919
Is the campaign in the ghetto over?

314
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,999
My sister went back there.

315
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,039
To the ghetto?

316
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,879
Anyone left alive was taken
to Janowska Camp.

317
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,999
The ghetto is empty.

318
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,719
You...

319
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,839
you...

320
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,519
and you...

321
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,159
come with me.

322
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,159
Szczepek, you stay here.

323
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,199
No, no, no.

324
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,719
Look!

325
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,319
We'll move you here. It's safer.

326
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,119
For you or for us?

327
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,159
There are lots of hiding places here.

328
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,599
How do we all fit into this shit hole?

329
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,119
I didn't promise to take care of every
Jew in Lvov. Too many is dangerous.

330
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,559
Exactly how many can be saved?

331
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,679
Ten.

332
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,599
Make it twelve or fourteen at least!

333
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,439
Ten, eleven at the most.

334
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,879
I've chosen seven.

335
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,719
And who made you God, Grossmann?

336
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,239
It was my room. I took all the risk.

337
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,719
- And the idea was mine, too.
- Which I'm paying for!

338
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,759
That makes you better than us?

339
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,679
Before the war we'd never have been
in the same room!

340
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,279
What a joke! Listen to the professor...

341
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,999
who refuses to speak Yiddish!

342
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,719
All your education didn't
buy you any sense.

343
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,359
Bringing children into such a hell!

344
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,399
You fool!

345
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,799
Better to leave them with the Germans.

346
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,799
- Like your loverboy did with his.
- Stop it, you bitch!

347
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,839
Quiet. Be quiet!

348
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,199
You old bitch!
- This is pointless! Enough!

349
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,279
So?

350
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,359
There's the four of us, Mundek...

351
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,399
Klara, Janek, Berestycki...

352
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,439
That makes eight.

353
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,719
Chaja,

354
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,479
- Landsberg.
- Why Landsberg?

355
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,119
- He's a cripple!
- At least not a mental cripple!

356
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,599
So, Landsberg makes ten...

357
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,879
- Frankiel eleven.
- Speak Polish, damn it!

358
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,239
And Irena?

359
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,199
- Frankiel is more useful.
- I'm staying here anyway...

360
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,439
I don't trust these Polacks.

361
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,079
Who's coming?

362
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,439
- There's twelve of us.
- I said ten.

363
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,839
- I'm staying here. - You have to come.
- Why? - Because I say so!

364
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,999
I'm begging you...

365
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,719
Twelve. Like the twelve apostles.

366
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,359
A Yid wouldn't know,
but the twelfth was Judas!

367
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,839
There were always twelve.

368
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,439
After Judas there was Matthias.

369
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,359
Okay, twelve, but that's it!

370
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,079
- You can come with us.
- Daniel, too?

371
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,479
I'm not coming without him. And what
about those kids? They have no one.

372
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,719
Thirteen? Fourteen? Sixteen?

373
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,799
Give a Jew a finger
and he'll take your arm!

374
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,319
- I'm begging you...
- No!

375
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,119
Eleven or no one.

376
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,359
You can always leave your kids
behind, if you like, Mrs. Chiger.

377
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,279
We'll wait here.

378
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,719
Come on.

379
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,279
Krysia!

380
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,439
Krysia, come on.

381
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,719
Here you go, little one.

382
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,799
We're grateful for all you've done...

383
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,559
But 500 a day for only eleven
is a lot...

384
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,719
Out of which I buy all your bread,
potatoes and sugar!

385
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,879
- Yes, but you still earn...
- A mere 70 zlotys...

386
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,399
that I share with Szczepek.

387
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,119
You're bargaining over your own life.
You're just like any other Yid!

388
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,319
Wait.

389
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,039
Wait!

390
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,879
Goddamned rats!

391
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,519
Come here.

392
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,039
Come on.

393
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,399
Goddamned vermin!

394
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,999
Are you cold? We'll be alright.

395
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,039
Don't be afraid, little one.

396
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,799
Mama, will they bite us?

397
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,639
- Marysia will love this!
- There's blood on it.

398
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,079
I'll wash it out. It's the perfect size.

399
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,039
- For your Stefcia. - They're hideous!
- Give them to her.

400
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,719
A ghetto souvenir from Uncle Szczepek.

401
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,359
There you are! Speak of the devil!

402
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,879
I was just asking your charming wife
where you were.

403
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,519
You've got Jews living in your sewers!

404
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,799
- Poldek knows nothing about it.
- Like I said, I only saw corpses.

405
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,039
A woman on Peltewna Street
could smell fried onions.

406
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,239
It came from her toilet.
I could smell it myself. Look.

407
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,719
They must be here.

408
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,039
If we enter the sewer here, it can't
be far. Can we get down there?

409
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,519
- Well, yes.
- So let's go.

410
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,599
Come on, Poldek, let's go!

411
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,039
No one knows the sewers
better than your husband!

412
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,439
Listen, I live in a beautiful home.

413
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,279
Want to know who gave it to us?

414
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,279
Some rich Yid family I never even met!

415
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,479
Poldek,

416
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,079
the Germans pay 500 cash
for every Jew we catch.

417
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,599
Let's hope we'll find
some Jews in the sewers.

418
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,919
Preferably rich ones.

419
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,759
Look.

420
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,479
- Idiot, you announced us! Be quiet!
- The rat scared me, sir.

421
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,919
God, what a stench.

422
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,559
You could choke to death in here.

423
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,199
Poldek!

424
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,359
Isn't it this way?

425
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,399
Well...

426
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,839
Poldek...

427
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,599
Fuck it!

428
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,719
I can check over there, if you want.

429
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,159
Alright. Check it out.

430
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,719
Nothing here.

431
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,359
Fuck! The shit's ruined my boots!

432
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,119
Take me outside.

433
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,159
- No way. It's much too dangerous.
- Please! Just for a little bit.

434
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,439
My shoes are broken.

435
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,879
I don't know.

436
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,799
How are the children?

437
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,439
It's only a rat.

438
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,359
Come on, sit down.

439
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,799
She took one look
at the tablecloth and said...

440
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,759
it was nice. "Nice!" After all the
trouble I took to clean it!

441
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,799
- So I told her to fuck off.
- Szczepek!

442
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,599
Then she told me she'd rather "..."
Aleksy anyway.

443
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,879
Wanda, we have to find Szczepek
a woman like you...

444
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,079
just a little younger.

445
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,839
New?

446
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,039
This here? From Mr. Chiger.

447
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,799
- It's Swiss.
- Mr. Chiger?

448
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,079
Yes, he's one of our Jews.
Hasn't Poldek told you about...?

449
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,359
Jews, Poldek?

450
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,319
We found some Jews in the sewers.

451
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,919
- And you're helping them?
- Mrs. Socha...

452
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,439
Wanda...

453
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,599
they pay us.

454
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,079
So that's your "raise".

455
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,919
You said the Jews were just like us.

456
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,119
- That Jesus was a Jew.
- This is different.

457
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,639
- Jesus was a Jew?
- I did it for you and Stefcia!

458
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,039
- Don't you dare say you did it for us!
- Wanda!

459
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,559
Don't you touch me!

460
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,759
Is that really true? Jesus was a Jew?

461
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,039
Janek!

462
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,039
Chaja.

463
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,319
Bortnik, how are you?

464
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,719
Lousy.

465
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,519
Didn't I tell you?
They were there, the bastards!

466
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,879
They found a bunch of Yids
in your sewer, you hear?

467
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,039
What? Where?

468
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,599
- We missed out!
- How many?

469
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,799
I don't know.

470
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,839
Their bodies were left to rot.
They must've had help.

471
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,519
Otherwise they could never
have survived this long.

472
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,879
What do you think, Poldek?

473
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,199
- If I get my hands on the bastard!
- Fucking hell, all that money!

474
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,199
Bortnik, if there are any Yids left,
don't worry, they're ours!

475
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,279
Stay, let's have a drink.

476
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,359
Make haste slowly!
I'll get the next round.

477
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,599
- Will you join me?
- We have work to do.

478
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,639
Coming, Szczepek?

479
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,559
You look like you could use
another drink.

480
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,679
You heard the boss.

481
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,999
A shot of vodka for me!

482
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,839
Let's go! Hurry up!

483
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,839
What if they talked before
they were killed?

484
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,559
Then we'd be dead by now.

485
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,559
- No, Poldek!
- What?

486
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,119
Come on!

487
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,839
I can't help you anymore.

488
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,359
What did you say?

489
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,279
- What about ours?
- They must not know.

490
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,199
So they're alright?

491
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,599
Who led the Krauts here?

492
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,399
You?

493
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,319
Go to hell, you vermin!

494
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,199
Give it back! That's my crayon!

495
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,559
- Mama, he won't give it back!
- It's mine!

496
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,639
Give it back, it's my crayon...

497
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,319
- Give it to her, Pawel.
- Let go, it's my crayon, I cut it!

498
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,439
Look at that idiot!

499
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,639
God isn't listening!

500
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,359
Come on...

501
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,439
Give it back, Pawel!

502
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,879
- Children, be quiet.
- Mama! Give it back!

503
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,359
Hey, Janek!

504
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,719
Stop it!

505
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,239
Janek, Janek! Stop, stop it!

506
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,719
- Calm down.
- I will shoot, I swear!

507
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,719
- Get away!
- Calm down... - Janek.

508
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,999
Stop crying or I'll shoot! I swear!

509
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,319
Get away from me!

510
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,999
I swear!

511
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:56,159
- Calm down, calm down!
- Stop this damned praying!

512
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,079
- God isn't here!
- Janek, put the gun down!

513
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,439
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

514
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,599
Janek, calm down.

515
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,079
Come on, put the gun down.

516
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,919
Put the gun down.

517
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,399
- What happened?
- Nothing.

518
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,439
Mundek?

519
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,359
Where's Janowska?

520
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,999
It must be around there
to the left somewhere.

521
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,919
Klara!

522
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,439
I am... "Cinder... girl?"

523
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,599
- Cinderella.
- Cinderella.

524
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,319
Do they fit?

525
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,799
Do you miss Leipzig?

526
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,439
I haven't seen my family in four years.

527
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,239
The letters stopped coming two years
ago. I have no home anymore.

528
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,439
The German who hanged my father...

529
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,519
the one...

530
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,639
who actually pulled the rope...

531
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,319
had just promised to save him.

532
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,319
Papa made me promise...

533
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,919
to take care of Mania...

534
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:35,039
She's very spoiled...
but she has a good heart.

535
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,719
We always fought, so he had to
make me promise.

536
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,039
- Well?
- The flame looks good.

537
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,039
They got the others, not ours.

538
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,599
- Any change?
- It's safe.

539
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,599
There's no methane today.

540
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,719
- Did you hear what I said? The Jews...
- Jews?

541
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,199
What Jews?

542
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:23,359
Tickets...

543
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,639
Curtain!

544
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,399
The gate is already closed.

545
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,679
The people sleep, the birds sleep,
the cats and the dogs sleep, too.

546
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,799
So close your little eyes.

547
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,119
Everyone's asleep...

548
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,919
so you should sleep, too.

549
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,719
If I earn 200 zlotys...

550
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,119
I will buy you a beautiful house.

551
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,319
Then you will sleep like a princess
on a bed of white roses.

552
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,919
Good night. Now close your eyes.

553
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,239
And this house will have a garden...

554
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,199
and a choir of singing birds.

555
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,879
They will sing you
sweet fairy tales till dawn.

556
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,879
Good night. Now close your eyes.

557
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,679
You sing beautifully, Krysia.

558
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,919
Wonderful!

559
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,999
Klara, take this.

560
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,759
I have run out of money, Mr. Socha.

561
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,359
But don't worry...

562
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,799
right after the Germans entered,
I hid some jewelry.

563
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,039
Put me down, you idiot, put me down!

564
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,599
I want to show you something.

565
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,399
It's Chiger's. I'm supposed to sell it.

566
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,679
Wanda, you'd never have to work again.

567
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,439
You'd have your own maid.

568
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,479
They're not even grateful
for anything I've done for them.

569
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,319
All they do is demand.

570
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,319
It's gone.

571
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,919
It was in the left pocket. Gone!

572
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,399
It's gone.

573
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,799
I've looked here, too.

574
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,799
Maybe... it's over there.

575
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:03,039
- I've looked everywhere.
- It was stolen. - Yes.

576
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,879
They took it.

577
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,239
Get down, get down!

578
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:14,919
I signaled.

579
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,879
Why so scared?

580
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,719
We were worried you wouldn't come back.

581
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,599
Or with the Gestapo.

582
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,239
Where's Janek?

583
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,439
He ran off.

584
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,479
- With Frankiel and Landsberg.
- They'll be caught and...

585
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,999
Janek will never talk! Never!

586
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,279
I'm glad you have such faith in him.

587
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,479
Never!

588
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,879
I thought you were going to sell them.

589
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,799
I won't be coming back.

590
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,679
I'm risking my life, my family's life,
for what?

591
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,879
Complaints and accusations.
And now this betrayal.

592
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,599
Enough. This is too much.

593
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,719
Szczepek was right.

594
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,399
Mundek!

595
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,919
- He'll run straight to the Gestapo.
- He could've done that ages ago!

596
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,279
- He could've kept the jewels!
- Mundek!

597
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,639
- We should've killed him long ago.
- He didn't have to come back!

598
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,399
Are you crazy?

599
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,759
I'm very sorry, Mr. Socha.

600
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,039
You'll die here like dogs.

601
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,119
Mr. Socha!

602
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,359
Are you happy now?

603
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,719
Mr. Socha!

604
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,559
Are you thirsty?

605
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,559
Are you tired?

606
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,759
Go on, lie down.

607
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,399
That's nice!

608
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,079
Is that nice?

609
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,159
- We need to do another job.
- What?

610
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,559
- Two addresses we haven't hit.
- Oh, I thought...

611
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,119
What?

612
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,319
The Jews.

613
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,759
What Jews?

614
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,759
Poldek...

615
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,799
I wasn't just scared for myself.

616
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,479
My Marysia's pregnant.

617
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,599
Is it yours or Aleksy's?

618
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,199
- Hey, you asshole!
- Stand up!

619
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,279
You stupid asshole!

620
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,919
Wipe your nose, you chickenshit!

621
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,399
Fucking bastard!

622
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,599
Crybaby!

623
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,999
Coward!

624
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,519
Crybaby...

625
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,319
One, two, three, four...

626
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,719
Chaja?

627
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,399
Get her some water.

628
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,559
Get her some water!

629
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,439
She's had her ration.

630
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,199
Give her mine.

631
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,999
Okay, right, come on.
Let's start all over again.

632
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,359
One, two, three, four...

633
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,839
Do you think Janek's still alive?

634
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,439
Do you?

635
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,999
I keep dreaming I'm eating
my mother's plum cake.

636
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,039
I don't dream about eating.

637
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,599
What is it?

638
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,759
I used to snitch on Mania for eating
all the plums off the cake.

639
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:06,399
I hated how she got off so easily.

640
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,599
- I can't go on anymore.
- Yes, you can.

641
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,199
You must go on.

642
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,199
You will!

643
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,079
If you don't live, I don't live either.

644
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,999
And I plan on living
a long and happy life.

645
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,559
What are you doing?

646
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,559
I have to join my group.

647
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,479
- You're late.
- I don't have a watch.

648
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,759
Alright. Go on then.

649
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,319
Wait!

650
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,079
You look a little too healthy.

651
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,519
- Maybe you're a partisan.
- Partisan? Can't you see I'm a Jew?

652
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,279
There are Jewish partisans.

653
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,519
- You're keeping me from my work.
- Shut up!

654
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,079
- Shut up or I'll shoot!
- I always do my job!

655
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,159
- I told you to shut up!
- You'd be shooting a good worker!

656
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,319
There you are, you stinking Yid!

657
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,039
Thanks for finding him.
I'll beat the shit out of you!

658
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,839
- What's he saying?
- This fucking Jew...

659
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,039
was supposed to help me in the sewers.

660
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,719
What's the Polack talking about?

661
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,519
I'm an inspector.

662
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,199
- I'll show you my identification.
- What's that in your pocket?

663
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,039
- I found it over there. Want some?
- What's he saying?

664
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,199
He's offering you a drink.

665
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,999
- You're trying to bribe me?
- No, no.

666
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,719
- Yes, he is.
- You're coming with me, both of you!

667
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,159
- Why are you here, in God's name?
- None of your business, traitor!

668
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,519
Goddamned Polack.

669
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,919
"Let your brother find his own job,"
I told her.

670
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,799
There's a war on. It's hard
on everyone.

671
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,159
Listen, we don't have much time
to find the blockage.

672
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,719
Let's split up and meet back
in ten minutes.

673
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,919
Okay, boss.

674
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,239
- What are you doing here?
- Mr. Socha, we got lost.

675
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,479
- Where are your parents?
- If we knew, we wouldn't be lost.

676
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,239
Socha!

677
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,799
Wait here. I'll be back.

678
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,039
I've found something.
I'll take care of it. You go home.

679
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,519
Pirate!

680
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,999
I've found your children.

681
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,879
Krysia!

682
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,599
Thank you!

683
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,479
Thank you.

684
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,119
- You're welcome, Mrs. Chiger.
- Thank you.

685
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,119
It's alright.

686
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,319
Krysia, Pawel...

687
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,759
Oh, my God!

688
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,759
If you like...

689
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,719
I could continue as before.

690
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,199
Do you still have the jewelry,
Mr. Chiger?

691
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,239
Krysia...

692
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,039
Have you found them?

693
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,879
Have you heard?

694
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:26,479
The Germans have been having their fun.
They hanged ten Poles in revenge...

695
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,879
for a single German soldier.

696
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,839
A German soldier?

697
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,399
But they weren't satisfied,
so they shot 40 more people.

698
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,719
Or maybe 50,
all good, God-fearing Poles.

699
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,599
You know, whoever killed
that soldier is a hero to me...

700
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,039
but the innocent always have to suffer.

701
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,279
- Come, I'll show you.
- Thank you.

702
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,519
Don't be too long, Anelka, okay?

703
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,919
FOR THE BRUTAL MURDER OF KURT GOTZ
5 JANUARY 1943 - MARTYR AND SOLDIER

704
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:02,879
Papa!

705
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,479
Stefcia!

706
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,479
Wanda...

707
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,359
Szczepek...

708
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,559
they hanged him.

709
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,399
Stefcia, go upstairs.

710
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,439
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

711
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,439
No, Szczepek hasn't worked
with me in months.

712
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,759
It was a coincidence.

713
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:47,759
It was because of something
completely different.

714
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,199
He was innocent.

715
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,439
- I can do it.
- Can you manage?

716
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,799
- Count the stitches for me.
- Will you count them, too?

717
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,119
- Hey, look, you see?
- Can I try?

718
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,239
Mama, don't you count them?

719
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,159
I don't need to.

720
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,999
Quiet. Be quiet!

721
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,319
Someone's coming, hide!

722
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,839
Oh, shit!

723
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,039
Help me!

724
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,919
There are Jews here!

725
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,879
I've found Jews!

726
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,519
Jews!

727
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,839
I've found Jews!

728
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,839
Come with me, hurry!

729
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,519
Leave your things.

730
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,999
Leave everything here!

731
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,079
Mr. Chiger, let's go!

732
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,359
Head and shoulders first,
the rest will follow.

733
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,639
Quick, move on!

734
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,479
- Be careful.
- Climb up.

735
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,999
Be careful, Krysia.

736
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,559
Go on, you're next. Faster!

737
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,799
- Chaja, go on!
- No...

738
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,879
- No, no, no!
- Crawl! - Come on.

739
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,519
What's wrong, Chaja?

740
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,719
Your hips. Move your hips!

741
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,479
- Move your hips! - Save me!
- Take my hand. - Keep moving!

742
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:03,919
Crawl, for fuck's sake!

743
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,919
Go on, take my hand!

744
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,999
Come on, come on!

745
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,759
Hurry up!

746
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,839
- Pull!
- Hurry up!

747
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:00,159
You've been stealing food!
That's why you got stuck...

748
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,719
I'm wearing a thick coat.

749
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,679
Can't you see?

750
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,919
Don't you talk to me like that!

751
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,999
What's that?

752
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,759
- We're beneath Our Lady of the Snow.
- You can hear everything.

753
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:42,399
That's why you have to be very quiet.
Absolutely no yelling.

754
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,999
I'll go get your things.

755
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,479
Will we be staying here now?

756
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,439
Yes.

757
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,679
I'm going to have a baby.

758
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,199
What?

759
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,719
I'm going to have a baby.

760
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,399
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

761
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,159
Janek's?

762
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,759
Ours.

763
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,799
Do you understand? It's ours.

764
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,079
All of ours!

765
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:30,439
Poor kid! As if one set of parents
wasn't enough!

766
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,399
You know, I was trying to get
into Janowska Camp when we...

767
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,039
when I killed that soldier.

768
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,319
It's easier to walk when
the water's low.

769
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:13,239
How can you work in these?
My feet feel twice as big.

770
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,559
You know what they say
about men with big feet.

771
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,159
Janek...

772
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,799
They didn't get very far.

773
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,079
You still want to get into Janowska?

774
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,719
Mania may still be alive.
Either way, Klara has to know.

775
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,519
And I always thought
all Yids were cowards.

776
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,519
Come on in.

777
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,079
Right, so you're the genius
who wants to...

778
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:27,719
get into Janowska?
Go on in.

779
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,159
Listen to me carefully.

780
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,519
Tomorrow morning first thing
you will go into the camp.

781
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,439
Then someone from the camp will
change places with you for two days.

782
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:44,239
The guards can't tell?

783
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:50,079
Not as long
as there are 50 in each brigade.

784
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:54,759
This poor guy wants to go and look
for his wife in the ghetto.

785
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,719
I told him it's useless,
but he insists...

786
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,719
- on going there himself.
- Will he come back? - Absolutely.

787
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,279
His whole family is in the camp.

788
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,639
So he's sure to come back.

789
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,759
God will repay me.

790
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,359
- See you soon.
- Remember...

791
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,759
- if anyone asks...
- You went to get supplies.

792
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,599
Get a move on! On your knees!

793
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:45,799
Get down!

794
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,039
I said get down. Down!

795
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,399
Get a move on. Faster!

796
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,399
Move it, come on!

797
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,079
Faster!

798
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:01,079
Get a move on!

799
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,639
Move it, move it!

800
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,559
On your knees!

801
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,719
Stay down!

802
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,040
Caps off!

803
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,079
Where's your cap?

804
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,439
It was stolen, sir.

805
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,919
Bad luck. Without a cap...

806
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,799
you have no business here.

807
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,359
The man's healthy!

808
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,439
Can't you see?

809
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,079
If you must use a bullet...

810
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,599
use it wisely.

811
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,119
Cap!

812
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:24,439
Please.

813
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,599
Thank you.

814
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,279
Caps on!

815
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,679
Good, very good. Very good.

816
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,199
Jesus!

817
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:18,879
Do you realize the danger?

818
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,799
The crying will bring down
half the city!

819
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,999
Chaja, it's coming.

820
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,839
Easy, it's coming.

821
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,799
Once more, it's coming.

822
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,999
It's a boy!

823
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,719
- If Janek could see him!
- Janek's dead.

824
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,119
Scissors.

825
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:03,919
Get out!

826
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,039
You're upsetting her, can't you see?

827
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,279
A baby? But how?

828
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,239
She always wore bulky clothes.

829
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:26,119
Who will take in a Jewish baby?

830
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,639
I'll see the nuns at the convent.

831
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:40,719
A boy?

832
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,639
A sweet little guy.

833
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,719
- Is he circumcised?
- They're not that stupid.

834
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,279
You know...

835
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,919
we could always say...

836
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:04,559
he's my brother's.

837
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,999
My sister-in-law is in hospital...

838
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,719
so we're taking care of their baby.

839
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,719
Quiet...

840
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:43,399
I wish we could find a Mohel,
who could do it properly.

841
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,239
- He will not be circumcised!
- He must be! - No, no.

842
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,599
- Chaja...
- I said no!

843
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,039
Give him to me.

844
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:54,919
Give him to me!

845
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:57,839
Give him to me, right now!

846
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,359
He's not yours!

847
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,639
Keep the child quiet!

848
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,079
Put the light out.

849
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,519
Do you know Mania Keller?

850
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,639
Does anyone know Mania Keller?

851
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,399
Who knows Mania Keller?

852
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,239
- Who knows Mania Keller?
- I know Mania Keller.

853
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:03,759
The child, the child...

854
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,239
it's only praying.

855
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:12,239
And the dear Lord, the dear Lord...

856
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:14,039
He hears it.

857
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,359
What?

858
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,639
The baby's dead.

859
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,639
She smothered him.

860
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,519
- Maybe it's for the best.
- For whom?

861
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,359
- For Socha?
- What?

862
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,679
- Klara!
- What?

863
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:45,799
No!

864
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,359
I came to say...

865
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,359
that my wife and I agreed...

866
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,559
to take him.

867
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:06,999
She wants to...

868
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,919
- throw him into the river.
- No!

869
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:14,559
A burial.

870
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,679
He must have a proper burial.

871
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,439
Are you coming?

872
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:41,519
I'm sorry.

873
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,679
I'm sorry, Mr. Socha. I know...

874
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,759
I know you're not to blame.

875
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:50,999
I understand.

876
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:54,599
Mundek has never been away this long.

877
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,119
He went to Janowska...

878
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,199
to look for Mania.

879
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:38,319
Klara shouldn't feel guilty.
I just couldn't live...

880
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,559
- in that sewer.
- You can! Mania...

881
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:44,719
I came here for you.
I can get you out of here.

882
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,839
- Mania, please!
- Where is he? - Tell Klara...

883
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:49,999
Where is my husband? Tell me...

884
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,639
- My Janek, is he with that whore?
- Mrs. Grossman, your husband is dead.

885
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,679
You're lying!

886
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:00,719
- I know where he is!
- Come with me!

887
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,839
Go, just go. There's a guard coming!

888
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:07,279
- Come with me! - Just go!
- My child is dead. This is hell!

889
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,399
- Rachel's dead!
- The guards!

890
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:18,559
Kovalev!

891
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:26,079
I know my way.

892
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:36,119
Mania wouldn't come.

893
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,119
I tried everything but
she just wouldn't.

894
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,319
I'm so sorry.

895
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:53,719
It's alright.

896
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,479
Matzo!

897
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,039
It'll be Passover soon, won't it?

898
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:14,679
I found them in a Jewish home.
And I brought you something else.

899
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,199
- Pirate!
- Thanks!

900
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,159
This is for you.

901
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,279
Krysia!

902
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:34,759
Don't you want to have a look?

903
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:40,119
She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak.

904
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:41,719
Krysia.

905
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,359
She even tore up her drawings.

906
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:48,199
- What's wrong, Krysia?
- I don't know what to do.

907
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:02,799
Come on.

908
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:04,879
Let's go.

909
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,839
I want to show her something.

910
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,799
Breathe deeply.

911
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,359
And again.

912
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,599
Mr. Socha...

913
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,799
Mr. Socha, we can't pay you anymore.

914
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,359
Friday's payment was the last.

915
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:54,439
We have nothing left. Nothing.

916
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:57,439
Mr. Socha...

917
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,679
- can I ride piggyback?
- Another time, dear.

918
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:02,399
Piggyback? No problem.

919
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:12,679
Giddyup, Mr. Socha!

920
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:29,679
Mr. Chiger...

921
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,999
Do the others know?

922
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:40,319
I didn't want them to panic.

923
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:53,639
Alright.

924
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:58,199
Here's next Friday's payment.

925
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,399
Pay me in front of the others.

926
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,079
I don't want them to think I'm a sucker
who's doing all this for nothing.

927
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:30,719
Socha!

928
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:36,639
Quiet, I have a child sleeping!

929
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:39,439
Let us in for a drink.

930
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,039
- Go to sleep, Stefcia.
- You've had enough.

931
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:48,159
Poldek, do you want to make me look like
a liar in front of my buddy? Let us in!

932
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:52,199
Poldek, hurry, get them
something to eat.

933
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:55,439
Cheers, Max.

934
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:05,159
Leave it, Papa, that's for the Jews!

935
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,119
What a pretty little girl!

936
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,159
What Jews?

937
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,799
- She just...
- Shut up, let her talk!

938
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:28,439
These are my Jews.

939
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,159
And they're hungry.

940
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:34,719
- Why Jews?
- Uncle Szczepek...

941
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:38,839
brought them from the ghetto for me.
Two little Jewish girls.

942
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,559
But this one...

943
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,359
- has blond hair.
- Jews can have blond hair, too.

944
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:53,639
- She's a clever one!
- She's to have her first communion.

945
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:59,159
- We'd like you to come. Right, Poldek?
- Of course! You'd be very welcome.

946
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:05,559
And I'm sure Stefcia's Jews won't mind,
if we share their food with you.

947
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:08,799
- Please, make yourself at home.
- Poldek!

948
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:14,479
Max, why the long face?
Let's have a drink. Cheers!

949
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:17,479
Socha, to your health!

950
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,319
Didn't I tell you... Didn't I?

951
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:40,559
Don't you dare blame her!

952
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:43,639
- You brought this on us, not her!
- She has to learn!

953
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,319
And when will you learn?
Wasn't it enough they hanged Szczepek?

954
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,039
Have no fear...

955
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:41,679
Mama, why are you laughing?

956
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,919
Why are you laughing?

957
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:53,279
Why are you laughing, Mama?

958
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:57,759
Klara, what's going on?

959
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:28,519
- I have to go.
- Are you crazy?

960
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:33,079
- I have to move them.
- But it's Stefcia's communion!

961
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,119
I won't be long. Just to check on them.

962
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:36,279
Poldek!

963
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:52,839
Socha, what's up?

964
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,599
- What are they doing?
- Laying mines.

965
01:57:56,040 --> 01:58:00,159
- A little surprise for the Russians.
- Don't you know what's down there?

966
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:05,079
Gas pipes! If you hit one, everything
will be blown up in a second!

967
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:07,439
The Germans are leaving. Do you think
they give a shit?

968
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:08,799
What's going on here?

969
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,839
- Nothing, sir.
- Gas! Gas!

970
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:13,719
You'll all be blown up!

971
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:16,759
Poldek, shut up!
There are gas pipes down there.

972
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,879
He's a sewer inspector.

973
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:25,679
Very well. Go down there with him.
If there are no gas pipes, shoot him!

974
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:29,119
- Yes, sir.
- Stop digging!

975
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:33,039
Sorry I couldn't come to church.
I'm on duty.

976
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:37,559
- Why aren't you with your family?
- It was pure stupidity.

977
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,919
I left my tools down here and
I got scared they might be swept away.

978
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,359
Satisfied?

979
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:05,719
Poldek!

980
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:10,799
Socha!

981
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:41,639
These tools must be worth a lot, for you
to leave your daughter's communion!

982
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:57,199
Are these your tools?
Or were you trying to save the rats?

983
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:01,719
- Is that it? Were you saving the rats?
- I don't know what you mean.

984
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:05,079
This whole time you've been hiding
Yids right under my nose.

985
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:06,439
You're crazy!

986
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:10,479
Stop, Poldek. Stop, God damn you!

987
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:22,599
Poldek, you were the only one
in Lonski that I trusted...

988
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,519
You betrayed me!

989
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,079
If you shoot me, you'll never find
your way back.

990
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:34,519
Tell me the truth! At least tell me
the truth, Socha!

991
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,399
Damn you! Stay here!

992
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:39,119
Socha!

993
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,439
Poldek!

994
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,239
Stay here!

995
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:10,119
- Please, Papa, make it stop!
- I can't, Krysia. Oh God!

996
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,919
Our Father who art in heaven...

997
02:01:58,240 --> 02:01:59,879
Don't gulp, breathe slowly.

998
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:34,439
It's a miracle, Mr. Socha!

999
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:37,719
A miracle! The water just went away.

1000
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:45,079
I'll go and get you some dry clothes.

1001
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:45,679
Oh, you fool.

1002
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:49,199
Or am I the bigger fool for coming back?

1003
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,439
I have to get them some dry clothes.

1004
02:05:57,880 --> 02:05:59,439
Don't speak.

1005
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:18,439
Listen!

1006
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:22,839
Russians...

1007
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:26,799
Russians!

1008
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:30,919
Where the hell are you going?
It's too dangerous. Hey!

1009
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:34,639
- It was dangerous all the time.
- Mundek, you're crazy!

1010
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:36,679
Be quiet, Paulina!

1011
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:39,279
I'm in charge!

1012
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:43,919
Mundek! No one makes a move here
without my permission!

1013
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:47,319
- Ignacy!
- Ignacy, calm down.

1014
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:54,199
Pirate!

1015
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:56,439
Chiger!

1016
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,719
You can come out!

1017
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:00,639
It's over!

1018
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:45,879
Mundek!

1019
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,639
Breathe, breathe!

1020
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:57,840
It's okay...

1021
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:31,999
Jesus Christ!

1022
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:40,559
I'm scared. Mama, I want to go back.

1023
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:47,519
Where the hell did they come from?

1024
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:54,079
- Come on...
- Come, come.

1025
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:57,119
Come on, Klara, let's go.

1026
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:06,159
Come on.

1027
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:15,919
It's okay, okay...

1028
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:19,919
Dear God...

1029
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,399
where did you come from?

1030
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:24,639
From the dead, sir...

1031
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:26,639
From the dead.

1032
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:28,559
Eat this, little girl.

1033
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:33,159
You must be hungry.
Eat. It's still warm.

1034
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:35,839
What are you looking at?

1035
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:41,759
Don't you have anything better to do?
Move along!

1036
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:46,519
Wanda!

1037
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:48,879
Wanda...

1038
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,679
Here, please, have some cake.

1039
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:54,119
It's all over now!

1040
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:56,439
You are safe now!

1041
02:10:58,080 --> 02:10:59,199
Here you are.

1042
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:00,839
Mr. Chiger...

1043
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,719
you're safe now.

1044
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:06,319
And now everyone, have some cake!

1045
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:09,119
Wanda baked it for you!

1046
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:11,639
Here you are.

1047
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,359
- Wanda!
- Here you are!

1048
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:22,559
- Please have some.
- This is my Wanda.

1049
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:26,559
My Jews. These are my Jews.

1050
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,359
- Please, have something to eat.
- My Jews!

1051
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:31,559
Socha.

1052
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:35,559
These are my Jews.
They're my work!

1053
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:42,599
"Socha's Jews" spent
14 months in the sewers of Lvov.

1054
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:44,559
On May 12, 1945, Leopold was killed,

1055
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:47,759
saving his daughter from an
out-of-control Russian army truck.

1056
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:54,639
At his funeral, someone said, "It's
God's punishment for helping the Jews."

1057
02:11:55,360 --> 02:12:01,039
As if we need God
to punish each other.

1058
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:12,599
Krystyna Chiger grew up

published in 2008.

1060
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:18,559
She and the others suvivors
escaped Soviet Lvov

1061
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:21,639
for Israel, Europe

1062
