1
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,646
Try pineapple.
I'll have some of that...

2
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:35,681
that turkey jerky,
that smoked turkey?

3
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,150
It's excellent,
and it's quite tender.

4
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:11,017
Wake up, Tommy.

5
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:28,734
Lemme get a shot, Connie.

6
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:31,337
Last call was 15 minutes ago.
Oh, come on.

7
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:37,076
Get one for him too. Whatever he wants.
I'm tryin' to get outta here.

8
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:40,112
Connie!
Bill, you want one?

9
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:43,282
Nah.

10
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,018
Oh, that's pretty.

11
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:49,622
Thank you.

12
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:51,624
Hey, what's your name again?

13
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:57,563
Mike. Right. I'm Tommy.

14
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:13,245
Hey. Buddy?
Buddy? New guy.

15
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,982
Back door.
Front door's closed.

16
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:25,891
Whoa. I'll take it.

17
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:33,599
Okay, Bill, we're closin' now!

18
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:37,003
Everybody went home, Bill.

19
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:39,271
Bye-bye!
Everybody went home.

20
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,875
Ahh.

21
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:34,186
Get me a three-quarter-inch
wrench, would you, Raymond?

22
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:51,771
Jesus Christ!

23
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:56,976
Your brother's here again.

24
00:04:57,044 --> 00:05:00,346
You want me to go talk to him?
No, get me a cup of coffee.

25
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:33,145
<i>Just don't look at him.</i>

26
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:39,185
What is wrong with him? I don't know.
Let's just go.

27
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:42,321
He's been standin' out there
every day for a week almost.

28
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,658
Good. Let him. He'll get tired of it
eventually. Well,<i> I'm</i> tired of it.

29
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:50,229
Rob. I'm just gonna talk
to him, okay? Relax.

30
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:57,469
What the fuck, Tommy, huh?

31
00:05:57,538 --> 00:05:59,972
What the fuck?
What do you want?

32
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,041
I just wanna know how it feels.

33
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:05,311
How what feels? How does
it feel to be a chump?

34
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,913
I don't know. You tell me.
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.

35
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:10,916
You're bein' an asshole. At
least I know I'm an asshole.

36
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:13,853
- Question is, do you know it? <i>-Yeah, I
know you're an asshole. Everybody does.</i>

37
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:16,522
<i>No, no. Do you know you're an asshole?
That's the question.</i>

38
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:18,657
I'm an asshole? Right!
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,726
Hey, you're an even
bigger asshole than me,

40
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:23,195
and if you don't think you are,
you're a bigger asshole than that.

41
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:25,965
You know what I'm talkin' about, man.
Hey, don't...

42
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,634
Let go of my finger, man!
Ah! <i> Rob!</i>

43
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:30,636
Stop! Stop! I'll break it off.
I don't wanna hurt you.

44
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:32,638
Get in the car. Rob.
Rob. Take it easy!

45
00:06:32,707 --> 00:06:35,641
Take it easy, man!
I'm warning you, man.

46
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,544
Jesus Christ!
Calm down.

47
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,766
Go, go, go, go, go!

48
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,925
Hey, Johnny!
Johnny!

49
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:29,128
Yo. Come here for a second, will ya?
Hurry up.

50
00:07:34,702 --> 00:07:37,403
What's up? Sit in here and keep
your foot on the gas pedal.

51
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,772
I wanna run upstairs and change my T-shirt.
This stallin' out?

52
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,941
Take me two seconds. Yeah.
Take your foot off the gas.

53
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,943
Let me listen for one second.
It's gonna stall out.

54
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:46,345
I need to listen to the engine.
I won't be able to start it.

55
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:48,647
Just for one second.
Will you trust me?

56
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:51,650
Take your foot off.
Come on.

57
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:54,920
That's a serious problem
you got there. Yeah.

58
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:57,189
All right.
Good luck.

59
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:59,658
But you can't leave it there.
You're blockin' my driveway.

60
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,461
All right, all right.

61
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:19,611
<i>What'd you tell me</i>
<i>when you came in here?</i>

62
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,282
<i>- I know what I said.
</i> - You made me promise to cut you off after one drink.

63
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,351
Okay? One drink.
I already served you two.

64
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,786
I didn't make you promise.

65
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:29,788
Jackie, what'd he say
when he came in here?

66
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:32,291
He said he promised one drink
and then he's outta here.

67
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,493
You weren't even here
when I came in, Jackie.

68
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:37,096
You say the same thing
every time you come in.

69
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:39,298
What the fuck you listen to her for?
She don't know. She was here.

70
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,567
Hey, show some respect.
Bill, back me up on this.

71
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:43,569
Back yourself up.

72
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:46,472
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Just give me one.</i>

73
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:51,810
You're a weak man. That's why I drink it
straight. The ice cubes are too heavy.

74
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,947
Thank you.

75
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,617
Hold it. Ho, ho, ho, ho.
I'll tell you what.

76
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:01,754
I'll give you five bucks
if you don't drink the drink.

77
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:03,856
I'll do it. Don't get weird
on me, Victor, please.

78
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:07,726
I'm not gettin' weird on you. I'll give
you five bucks. See, you can't do it.

79
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:10,396
- Give him the drink, for Christ's sake.
- Hey, butt out!

80
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:12,598
<i>What the fuck am I gonna
do with five bucks?</i>

81
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,067
All right. I'll give you $10.
Ten dollars?

82
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:17,169
Yeah, if you don't drink the
drink and you walk outta here.

83
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,671
<i>I've never been</i>
<i>so insulted in my life!</i>

84
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,874
<i>Big money. Do it!</i>

85
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:24,209
Look at this.
Ten bucks.

86
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:26,345
Unbelievable.

87
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:28,480
Out, now. Yeah. You're leavin'.
Out. I'm leaving?

88
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:30,482
Go. Go ahead.

89
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:34,319
I'm a weak man, Vic!
You little chickenshit!

90
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:38,624
<i>See, I knew he couldn't do it.</i>

91
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:54,206
Can I help you? Yeah, I
was in here last week.

92
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:57,776
I left my number. Just wonderin'
if you found a mechanic yet.

93
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:01,080
No, not yet. Hey,
'cause I'm available.

94
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:03,615
I know you're probably still
lookin' at other possibilities,

95
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:06,685
but, uh, I could start anytime.

96
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:09,121
I remember you.
Where's your car?

97
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,391
My car? Yeah, when you drove
away from here last week,

98
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,393
your car stalled out
down the block.

99
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:16,495
It took you 25 minutes
to get it started.

100
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:19,932
Well, it's a piece of shit, but, uh,
I got it runnin' pretty good now.

101
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:24,002
So how come you're on foot?

102
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,004
Just felt like walkin'.

103
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,012
That's... That's...
That's my number.

104
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:37,082
If I'm not there, you can leave
a message with this guy Vic.

105
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,652
Thanks a lot.

106
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,714
Do you think I'm using you?

107
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:11,517
Oh, Theresa, please.
Do you?

108
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:14,553
No. I said
I was sorry.

109
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,555
How many times
do I have to say it?

110
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:19,024
Whose baby do you
think I'm carrying?

111
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:22,594
Tommy's, okay? Is that
what you want me to say?

112
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:25,364
Is that what you think I think? How many
times do we have to go through this?

113
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:29,568
Well, if that's what you
think... It's not what I think.

114
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,570
Look, I said I'm sorry.

115
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,010
He's drivin' me crazy.

116
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,212
Well, don't let him. Ignore him.
I know, I know.

117
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:42,281
That's what I do.

118
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:46,919
Yeah. You don't
even look at him.

119
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:50,656
It's like you're tryin'
to punish him or somethin'.

120
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:53,825
What do you think,
I'm playing games?

121
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:56,228
No, I don't think
you're playin' games,

122
00:11:56,297 --> 00:12:00,232
but... you did go out
with him for eight years.

123
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,272
So what?

124
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:10,776
What do you mean,
"So what?"

125
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:14,513
What do you mean, what do I mean?
It's over. It's been over.

126
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:16,748
Yeah, well, you don't
have to be so fuckin' cold.

127
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:19,518
What do you want me to say,
I'm still in love with him?

128
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:21,520
Are you?

129
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,423
<i>No.</i>
<i>You idiot.</i>

130
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:28,093
Besides, if I wanted to be
with him, I would be with him.

131
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:31,997
And even if the baby was his,
I would still want you.

132
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,499
<i>What?</i>
Even if it was his baby?

133
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:38,837
- Meaning it could be.
- No, I was just saying that.

134
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:42,107
"I would still want you."
"Want." Not "love," want.

135
00:12:42,176 --> 00:12:45,110
<i>What do you</i> want <i>with me?</i> Oh,
you are such an asshole.

136
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,778
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
Yeah.

137
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:51,516
Yeah? Yeah? Well... Hey, hey, hey.
I'm in there.

138
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:54,453
<i>Do me a favor and</i>
<i>tell me your name again.</i>

139
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,655
<i>Come on. I told you</i>
<i>twice already.</i>

140
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:59,591
<i>I know, I know. But,
you see, I wanna say...</i>

141
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,562
It's Christine. It's not Christine,
but it sounds like Christine.

142
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:05,597
What's this?

143
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:09,468
Look into my...

144
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:11,770
Crystal! Crystal. Yeah.

145
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,772
Oh, my God.
I'm losin' my mind.

146
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,774
Ah.
That's a nice name.

147
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:17,776
Yeah, you said that
the first time.

148
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:19,611
- I did?
- Rum and coke.

149
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,182
Yeah, you did. Well, I'll say it again.
It's a nice name.

150
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:27,286
<i>It's different. That's why I can't
remember it, 'cause it's unusual.</i>

151
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:29,288
<i>Yeah, yeah, it is.</i>

152
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:31,290
- Hi.
<i>- Is your last name "Meth"?</i>

153
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,558
No, it's not "Meth."
<i>No, I'm kiddin'.</i>

154
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:36,628
What are you doin'?
What am I doin'?

155
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:40,699
<i>My name is common, but
yours, I swear to God,</i>

156
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:43,001
Who's watchin' Anna? <i>I'm
never gonna forget it.</i>

157
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,104
- Oh, who's that?
<i>- Because now,</i>

158
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,874
now I got it
"embezzled" in my head.

159
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:50,876
Yeah. All right. All right?

160
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:52,878
Now I'll tell you another reason.
Why?

161
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:56,648
Because it's a pretty name, and
you're pretty like your name.

162
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:59,284
Thank you.

163
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:01,920
You're killin' me.
<i>Oh, stop.</i>

164
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:05,223
You're makin' me blush. Pretty
name for a pretty girl.

165
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:08,226
Gimme a kiss.

166
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:10,662
Forget it.

167
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:13,131
- <i> You gamble?</i>
- No, I don't.

168
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,167
Okay, good. I'm gonna make you a bet.
Connie!

169
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:17,169
Let me get two big
glasses of beer...

170
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:20,906
and a little shot glass of
beer here for Cleo... Crystal!

171
00:14:20,974 --> 00:14:23,141
Not this stupid trick
again, Tommy.

172
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,745
What trick? Who do ya think you're
trickin' here, huh? <i>It's not a trick.</i>

173
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:28,613
<i>Be quiet, Connie.</i>
It's a trick.

174
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:31,249
It's a bet, all right?
It's a gentlemen's bet.

175
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:34,186
I bet you that I can drink
two big glasses of beer...

176
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:37,589
before you could drink
one little shot glass of beer.

177
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,394
But if I win,
I get to take you home.

178
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,429
If you win, you go home with me.

179
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:47,432
What kind of deal is that?
That don't make sense to me.

180
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,434
It's a<i> good</i> deal.
It's a good deal for me.

181
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:51,470
<i>I gotta see this.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

182
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:53,638
<i>You have to let me</i>
<i>finish one beer first.</i>

183
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:57,476
<i>You have to wait till I put my glass
down before... Let me get this straight.</i>

184
00:14:57,544 --> 00:14:59,711
You're gonna drink one
full glass of beer. Right.

185
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,115
When you put the glass down, I'm
gonna drink this little, Yeah.

186
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:05,117
Eensy-weensy
glass of beer.

187
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:08,053
And you're gonna drink another glass of
beer, and whoever finishes first wins?

188
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:10,722
<i>But remember, you can't touch my
glass, and I can't touch yours.</i>

189
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,125
<i>Come on. Let's just do it already.
Wait. Hold it.</i>

190
00:15:13,193 --> 00:15:16,128
<i>Connie, let me get</i>
<i>two shots of Wild Turkey.</i>

191
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:19,631
- Do you want me to leave?
<i>- Gotta warm up here.</i>

192
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,734
- I'm watching this.
- <i> One for you, one for me.</i>

193
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,903
Salute.
Salutey-booty.

194
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:30,442
- Whoo!
- Okay, here we go.

195
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,387
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

196
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:45,023
- You have to wait till I put
my glass down. - Well, come on.

197
00:15:46,393 --> 00:15:49,294
Hey, wait a second. No!
You can't touch my glass.

198
00:15:49,363 --> 00:15:51,296
Why not? That's not fair.
No, that's the deal.

199
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:53,465
- You can't touch my glass. I win.
- That's good.

200
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:55,634
- That's good.
<i>- That's not fair!</i>

201
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,069
<i>I know.</i>
Yeah.

202
00:15:58,138 --> 00:16:01,706
I'm glad we could talk. <i>What trick? I
explained the rules fair and square. I win.</i>

203
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:04,843
- <i> No. You said it was a gentlemen's...</i>
- I'm not a gentleman.

204
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:07,045
Hey!
Hey, what...

205
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:12,250
I win, and you lose.

206
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:15,520
Yeah, that means
you go home with me.

207
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:18,523
We'll see about that. Think
you got it like that, huh?

208
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:07,539
Do me a favor? Yeah? Anything.

209
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:09,941
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay.

210
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,245
Don't, don't sit with anybody
and don't talk to anybody.

211
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,514
No. And don't dance with
anybody else, okay?

212
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:17,816
I don't wanna lose you.
You won't.

213
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:19,818
All right?
Okay.

214
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:27,025
Mmm.
Want another drink?

215
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:29,628
I don't think so.
No.

216
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:32,197
You wanna sit down?
Uh, yeah. Okay.

217
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:34,299
Okay. Oh! Ooh! Okay.

218
00:17:34,368 --> 00:17:36,835
Jesus Christ! You all right?
Yeah.

219
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:38,837
Okay.

Okay.

Sorry.
Okay.

222
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:50,749
I'm so embarrassed. It's okay.
It's okay.

223
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:52,751
They're not paying attention.
Ahh!

224
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:55,086
You all right? Okay. Okay.

225
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:57,522
Be right back.
I'll be okay.

226
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:00,225
Take me home after this?
Take you home?

227
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:02,227
Take me home.
Okay.

228
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,262
Okay. Hurry.

229
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:31,189
Oh, I'm hot. Hey, man,

230
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,627
What you fuckin' talkin' about?
You are, right?

231
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:38,563
Fuck you! I don't give a shit,
but don't let Connie catch you.

232
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:40,599
She'll 86 your ass right outta here.
Great. Yeah.

233
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,801
Oh, God.

234
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:52,644
I don't even know anybody
who does it anymore.

235
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:55,380
That's why I was surprised
when you... What?

236
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,916
Uh, you got good shit or what?
No, I...

Why, you want some? This shit sucks.
Does it?

239
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:06,625
I wouldn't mind just doin'

240
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:09,427
'cause, uh, I got
somethin' goin' right here.

241
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:11,429
Aw, why not?

242
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,266
Sure hope nobody
comes in that door.

243
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:20,805
Hey. Freddie, how ya doin'?
Hey, man.

go home by yourself now.

Oh. Thanks.

300
00:25:56,803 --> 00:25:58,803
So do you.
You got new hair?

301
00:25:58,872 --> 00:26:00,972
I mean, not new, but, uh...

302
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,541
Yeah, it's smaller.
Yeah.

303
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,643
Hi, Tommy. Hey, Sandy.
Oh, your father.

304
00:26:05,712 --> 00:26:07,879
God, I'm so sorry.

305
00:26:07,947 --> 00:26:10,415
Hey.
Who's this?

306
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:13,151
George.
George. Yeah.

307
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:15,286
Haven't seen you since the wedding.
Yeah.

308
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:18,689
The wedding. Yeah. He wasn't
at our wedding, George.

309
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:21,859
Oh, your wedding.
Yeah. No, I, uh...

310
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:24,362
I, uh, don't know what happened.

311
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:26,497
Sorry.
It's all right.

312
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,601
Tony.
Tommy's here.

313
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,870
I got two eyes, Josie.
Hey, Dad.

314
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,473
Doesn't he look good?
I think he looks good.

315
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:38,342
He looks better now, that's for sure.
Oh, please.

316
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:40,344
For Christ's sake,
your brother is dead.

317
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:44,082
Couldn't we have one day without an
argument? Just one day, I'm asking you!

318
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,117
All right. Get off my back.
I'm not on your back!

319
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:48,419
I'm just asking... Ma! Get
off my back, will ya?

320
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:50,421
Please.

321
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:54,092
I'm goin' in.

322
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:01,732
She give you any money?
No, and I didn't ask.

323
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:03,768
Well, don't ask me either.
I'm not.

324
00:27:03,837 --> 00:27:06,337
I can't keep giving you
handouts forever.

325
00:27:06,406 --> 00:27:09,640
Did I ask you for anything?
I came here to see Uncle Al.

326
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,642
I didn't come here to get anything
from you. Don't yell at me.

327
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:14,679
I'm not yellin' at ya.
What do you... Okay, okay.

328
00:27:14,747 --> 00:27:16,848
Okay.

329
00:27:24,357 --> 00:27:26,290
Thanks.

330
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:32,597
Keep the pack. I got
a carton in the car.

331
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:09,200
Hey.

332
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:13,437
For weeks I said
he didn't look good.

333
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,541
Nobody listens to me.

334
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:22,046
<i>I just don't understand why he carried
on the way that he did if he knew.</i>

335
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:25,583
If he knew that... You know how many people
tried to change your father, Sandy?

336
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:27,785
It couldn't be done.

337
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:32,723
I couldn't change him. You couldn't change
him. Your mother couldn't change him.

338
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:36,194
My mother couldn't change him.
Nobody could change him.

339
00:28:37,597 --> 00:28:40,331
Sandy, you want more coffee?
No, thanks, Aunt Josie.

340
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,968
I couldn't change him. Your
brother couldn't change him.

341
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:46,704
I was, uh... I was sorry
to hear about you.

342
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:50,641
About me? Yeah. Uh, Matt
said that you lost your job?

343
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,744
Oh, that.
Yeah. Well...

344
00:28:53,813 --> 00:28:55,746
Whatever.
Yeah.

345
00:28:55,815 --> 00:28:58,282
Well, you know, good
mechanic's not easy to find.

346
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:01,452
Shouldn't be too hard for you to get
picked up by another place, right?

347
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:04,355
Yeah. I haven't really been lookin'.
Just takin' it slow.

348
00:29:04,424 --> 00:29:06,557
Ya know.
Good.

349
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:10,361
So... You know, if you're just lookin'
for a job just for the summer,

350
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,231
you should take over Al's truck.

351
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,667
Really? Yeah, Sandy said he
made out really good on that.

352
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:18,903
Uh...

353
00:29:18,972 --> 00:29:23,341
Drivin' an ice cream truck. I don't really
see myself drivin' an ice cream truck.

354
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,743
Hey, Sandy.
How ya doin'?

355
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:30,681
- You saw him recently, huh?
- Your father?

356
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,984
Yeah, there was a poker game at
his house last Saturday night.

357
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:35,720
You see? I never
played poker with him.

358
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:39,390
He would never ask me. No, no, no.
I was just passing by.

359
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:41,859
The light was on,
so I, ya know, went in.

360
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:45,329
We should go downstairs soon.
Yeah, you're right.

361
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:48,966
You know what he said to me?

362
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:53,037
He told me to stay after the game
and have one last drink with him.

363
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:55,706
That's what he said. One last drink.
Really?

364
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,543
Did he say anything about me?

365
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:04,882
Well, yeah. I mean,
we talked for a while.

366
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:06,884
I mean, uh... I'll bet it
was hard for him, Matt,

367
00:30:06,953 --> 00:30:11,055
because, uh, ya know, I mean, he
felt like he was a failure to you.

368
00:30:11,124 --> 00:30:14,258
He made me feel like a
failure, you know? It's...

369
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:16,761
Like not even a fail... Like nothin'.
Like I was nothin'.

370
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:20,765
No, but you know why? Because he felt
bad about the kind of father he was.

371
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:25,603
So he had to make you feel bad. And then
that probably made him feel even worse.

372
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:28,606
That's why he hated me. <i> Come on.
He didn't hate you.</i>

373
00:30:28,675 --> 00:30:30,841
<i>He didn't say he</i>
<i>hated you, Matthew.</i>

374
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,044
H-How could
he hate you?

375
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:35,913
I mean, who knows? M-Maybe
he thought you hated him.

376
00:30:35,982 --> 00:30:37,915
You think so?

377
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:40,751
<i>No. Hey, come on.</i>
<i>Don't listen to me.</i>

378
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,989
I'm just... Hey, deep down,
he knew how you felt.

379
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:47,858
Ya know? Just like, uh, you
know how he felt about you.

380
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:51,095
But along the way, things
got fucked-up, ya know?

381
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:54,532
But so what? I mean,
everybody's fucked-up.

382
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,001
Ya know? But nobody wants
anybody else to think they are,

383
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,937
but everybody knows
they are anyway, so...

384
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:08,446
The thing I'm tryin'
to say, Matthew, is that, uh,

385
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:13,117
I think, in his own way,
your father really loved you.

386
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:15,186
<i>It's... It's</i>
<i>that simple.</i>

387
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:31,302
Uh, we should really get
back downstairs. <i>Yeah.</i>

388
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,175
<i>Fuck. I just did</i>
<i>your line, man.</i>

389
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:40,177
I'm sorry. No, hey, man.
You deserve it.

390
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:41,779
It's all right.

391
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:54,458
Hey, Bill, did... Did
you ever kill anybody?

392
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:58,996
What kind of an asshole
question is that?

393
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:01,365
I mean in, uh, Korea.

394
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:04,268
What career?

395
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:06,437
- No.
- <i> Hey, Tommy.</i>

396
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:09,940
We're gonna get some food. You wanna come?
<i>No, I'm all right.</i>

397
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:14,845
Listen, uh, Rob said if you come to the
station again he's gonna call the cops.

398
00:32:14,914 --> 00:32:16,881
Did I come by today?
<i>No, but...</i>

399
00:32:16,949 --> 00:32:19,350
you're comin' by
like every other day.

400
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:21,752
<i>So what? Anyway, what
are you, his messenger?</i>

401
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:23,754
<i>Look, I'm just tellin' ya.
</i> Now<i> you're</i> tellin' me.

402
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:26,524
<i>You're gonna call the cops now?
</i> Forget it.

403
00:32:26,592 --> 00:32:29,226
<i>Remember somethin'. You wouldn't be
workin' there if it wasn't for me.</i>

404
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:32,830
<i>Am I supposed to quit</i>
<i>because you got fired?</i>

405
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:35,599
<i>No, but you could take my side for once.
You're my fuckin' brother.</i>

406
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:38,469
It was your own fault
you got fired.

407
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:40,504
<i>Oh, really? Who told
him about the money?</i>

408
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:43,441
Hey, he asked me. What was I
gonna do, tell him I took it?

409
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:46,343
No, but you could keep
your mouth shut.

410
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:50,281
<i>Why are you pissed at me? Every
time I talk to you lately...</i>

411
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:52,383
<i>Then don't talk to me, okay?</i>
<i>That's simple.</i>

412
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:56,887
If my best friend
stole my girlfriend...

413
00:32:56,956 --> 00:33:00,791
and fucked her and knocked her up and...
fired me,

414
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,094
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>I would do, man.</i>

415
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:07,031
Look, I asked ya. Now I'm
not gonna ask ya again.

416
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:09,066
Just move, all right?
What are you asking me?

417
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:12,236
- I said would you just...
- Hey, hey, hey, Matthew. Sit down.

418
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:14,638
- Just move, all right?
- <i>Raymond, sit him down, will ya?</i>

419
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:16,841
You big pussy. Hey! I said move!

420
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:19,143
You guys!
Hey!

421
00:33:19,212 --> 00:33:21,812
- Not on that clean floor!
- Christ!

422
00:33:23,883 --> 00:33:26,584
Come on! Oh, get
f... Get off him!

423
00:33:26,652 --> 00:33:28,786
<i>- Matthew, come on!</i>
- <i> Get off me!</i>

424
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:31,322
<i>Matthew, go!</i>
<i>Go! Come on, man!</i>

425
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:36,026
Now calm down!
Calm down, all right?

426
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:38,295
What is that guy doin'?
Just calm down.

427
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:41,899
Get him outta here! I asked him
about five times all fuckin' night!

428
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:44,068
Everything's all right. You
want a drink on the house?

429
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:48,739
If I were you, I'd shoot him.

430
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:52,843
Who?
Your ex-boss.

431
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:55,312
What's his name?
Rob?

432
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:57,815
Rob?
Rob's his name?

433
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:59,783
What?
Rob?

434
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,988
He steals your girlfriend
and that's his name?

435
00:34:24,343 --> 00:34:27,344
<i>So where's the fuckin'
after-hours clubs around here?</i>

436
00:34:29,782 --> 00:34:33,417
Not here, man. Forget about it.
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

437
00:34:33,486 --> 00:34:36,987
<i>Really? I really don't
feel like goin' home.</i>

438
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:41,125
Well, don't you have to, like,
work in the morning or anything?

439
00:34:41,193 --> 00:34:44,094
<i>Oh, man!</i> What do you do, anyway?

440
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:47,698
What do you do?
You're a mechanic?

441
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:51,635
Yeah.

442
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:57,007
Yeah, I been lookin' around, but if anybody
calls Rob for a reference, I'm screwed.

443
00:34:57,076 --> 00:34:58,876
Is the guy a scumbag or what?

444
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:01,245
Oh, he's pissed off at me.

445
00:35:01,314 --> 00:35:04,815
<i>He's</i> pissed off at me.

446
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:07,151
'Cause the kid's yours or what?

447
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:10,654
Well, she's got him thinkin'
otherwise, but... Nah.

448
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:13,824
I mean, yeah, but there's this
other thing that happened...

449
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:16,727
right before he let me go.

450
00:35:16,796 --> 00:35:19,730
What?
I borrowed money from him,

451
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:23,000
and, uh, I was
gonna put it back...

452
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:25,202
<i>You were gonna put it back?</i>

453
00:35:27,974 --> 00:35:30,441
- Well, he didn't know I took it.
- Hold on, man.

454
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:33,978
You took money from the station?

455
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:36,513
<i>Yeah. I mean, it was a
Friday night, and, uh,</i>

456
00:35:36,582 --> 00:35:39,650
I mean, he wasn't there, and so
I just borrowed this money.

457
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,753
I was gonna put it back.
<i>How much?</i>

458
00:35:42,822 --> 00:35:46,123
<i>Fifteen hundred.</i>
Fifteen hundred bucks?

459
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:48,425
<i>Yeah. But I went</i>
<i>to Atlantic City...</i>

460
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:51,261
that weekend, and then, I don't
know, I just lost it all.

461
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,531
The first time that ever happened to me.
Where am I goin'?

462
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,302
Uh, three more lights
and you can make a right.

463
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:03,774
How 'bout here?
Where? Here?

464
00:36:03,843 --> 00:36:06,276
<i>Yeah, man, I'm not</i>
<i>too far from...</i>

465
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:12,750
<i>Mind if I take another beer?</i>

466
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,088
See ya.

467
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:29,299
Fuckin' loser.

468
00:36:33,172 --> 00:36:36,907
How you feelin' today? I'm
okay, but I'm a little tired.

469
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:39,309
Hmm. Do you want
my pancakes?

470
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:41,912
Mm-mmm.
I'm feeling fat.

471
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:43,914
Oh, I-I like you fat.

472
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:49,153
<i>I don't have to go today.
I can stay with you.</i>

473
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:51,789
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>You pitching today?</i>

474
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:54,692
<i>Yeah. Why?</i> Well, maybe if you
don't go, your team will win.

475
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,328
- Ah! Ha-ha-ha!
- You said I was fat!

476
00:36:58,397 --> 00:37:01,365
<i>No, no. You said you were fat.
I said I liked you fat.</i>

477
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:05,936
- I said I was feeling fat. - Don't start
with me, okay? I'm not in the mood.

478
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:09,773
<i>I'm not in the mood today. Everything
I say is wrong.</i> I'm not starting.

479
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:13,010
God, Mr. Sensitive.

480
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,612
Is that a crime?

481
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:17,614
No.

482
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:23,787
What are you doin'?

483
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,990
I like you like that.

484
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:30,094
Yeah? You're so fat.

485
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:33,564
Stop. What do you got
in there, a Buick?

486
00:37:33,632 --> 00:37:35,966
What is it?
Uh!

487
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:38,502
Rob. Come over here, will ya?
<i>We're ready for the cake.</i>

488
00:37:38,571 --> 00:37:41,505
Bring that camera. Get a
shot of this beautiful face.

489
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:43,574
Really close.

490
00:37:43,642 --> 00:37:46,577
What are you doin',
you moron? Not me!

491
00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:49,847
Sandy. It's her birthday.
She's 22 years old today.

492
00:37:49,915 --> 00:37:52,382
<i>Twenty-five, Dad.</i>

493
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:54,918
<i>Twenty-five.</i>
<i>What do you mean 25?</i>

494
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:57,087
I'm only 42 years old.

495
00:37:57,156 --> 00:37:59,823
Right!

496
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:02,159
Right, and your name
is Pinocchio.

497
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:04,528
Oh, really? My name is what?
Pinocchio.

498
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:06,663
<i>Pinocchio.</i>
<i>Your nose is growing.</i>

499
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:08,766
Is it?
Uh-huh.

500
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,034
Can you see it growing?
I see it.

501
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:13,137
Look at it closely.
Uh-huh. I'm looking.

502
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:16,473
Then come over here and maybe you'll
get something else that grows, baby!

503
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:19,042
You are sick!
You are sick!

504
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:21,111
You're a bad boy!

505
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,113
<i>Don't be gross!</i>
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

506
00:38:23,182 --> 00:38:24,948
It was him.
It wasn't me.

507
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:28,218
Here comes the birthday cake.
Here comes the birthday cake!

508
00:38:35,594 --> 00:38:40,097
Can you guys liven this up a little?
I wanna sell it to channel "J".

509
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,099
Oh, yeah? You want me
to whip it out?

510
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:44,368
Don't, Tommy, don't!

511
00:38:44,436 --> 00:38:47,037
Sure. Just let me get out
the microscopic lens here.

512
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:49,139
Ooh! Ah-ooh!

513
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:51,208
Them's fightin' words.
Put up your dukes.

514
00:38:51,277 --> 00:38:53,210
<i>Raymond, attend me.</i>
Yes.

515
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,313
Kick him in the nuts.

516
00:38:56,382 --> 00:38:58,715
I'm gonna kick your ass!

517
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:00,584
Prepare to die.

518
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:02,986
Yeow!

519
00:39:03,055 --> 00:39:05,622
Hi-hi-hi!
Oh!

520
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,591
Ha-ha!

521
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:14,264
Hey-ah!

522
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:24,241
Oh, he killed me!

523
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,243
He killed me!
Oh, my baby!

524
00:39:26,312 --> 00:39:28,612
Oh, God! He needs mouth-to-mouth.
Oh, yes, I do.

525
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:32,349
<i>Good idea. Mmm!</i>

526
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:34,351
Wait.
More, more, more!

527
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,386
Oh, geez!
I thought it was you!

528
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:38,889
I... Oh...
Darling! Oh!

529
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,891
She was saving my life.
You don't understand.

530
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,161
And who's gonna save you from me?
I... He is.

531
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,998
Help me, please. He hasn't told you yet.
We're together now.

532
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:50,000
I thought she was you!

533
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:53,637
- He didn't know it was her.
<i>- You're in big trouble.</i>

534
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:55,939
Here.

535
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:58,442
Don't get mad. Okay?

536
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:07,017
Vic. I knew you were comin'.

537
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:09,152
Pitcher of beer, man.

538
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:11,488
Hey, Billy.

539
00:40:11,557 --> 00:40:13,490
Come home.

540
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,792
Why? I don't wanna
live there anymore.

541
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:19,329
Are we gonna talk about this?
There's<i> nothing</i> to talk about.

542
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:21,331
I get<i> no</i> support from you!

543
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,569
Oh, no. Just a roof over your
head, clothes on your back.

544
00:40:25,638 --> 00:40:29,006
Food on the table.
Oh, God, I hate you!

545
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,211
What?

546
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,346
Victor. You got my 10 bucks?

547
00:40:36,415 --> 00:40:38,382
'Cause if you don't,
take a walk.

548
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,450
I got your 10 bucks.

549
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,955
Victor!
Gimme a Wild Turkey.

550
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:58,168
Hey, Tommy.

551
00:40:58,237 --> 00:41:00,370
What?

552
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,739
Sorry about Al.

553
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,511
Yeah, me too.

554
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:09,980
Hey, Vic.
Give Tommy a beer.

555
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:12,916
Do I have to? You
buyin' me a beer?

556
00:41:12,985 --> 00:41:15,585
Yeah, I'm buyin' you a beer.
Wait, wait. H-Hold it.

557
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:17,621
Not, not, not that swill.

558
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,223
If he's buyin', I'll take
a bottled beer. Imported.

559
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:23,293
<i>What are you,</i>
<i>Mr. International?</i>

560
00:41:23,362 --> 00:41:26,363
Payback.
Still hurts.

561
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:29,666
Should've bent it back further.

562
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:33,236
Thank you.

563
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:37,574
See ya later.

564
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,518
Hey! What the fuck?

565
00:41:54,393 --> 00:41:56,460
Didn't you see me there?
Sorry, man.

566
00:41:56,528 --> 00:41:58,895
Hey, Tommy. What's up? Fuckin'
gave me a heart attack!

567
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:00,831
You all right?
Yeah.

568
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:03,967
Hmm. Got a new fuckin'
problem, that guy.

569
00:42:04,036 --> 00:42:06,937
<i>No, put the car in neutral</i>
<i>and turn it off.</i>

570
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:08,638
<i>I put the car in neutral</i>
<i>and turned it off.</i>

571
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:11,641
If you'd done that, James, it
wouldn't have jumped fuckin' forward.

572
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,643
Can we get two Budweisers?

573
00:42:13,712 --> 00:42:16,913
<i>You 21?</i>
I'm 22.

574
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:18,982
You got I.D.?

575
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:25,655
He's 22. Can't serve
him without I.D.

576
00:42:25,724 --> 00:42:27,891
<i>He shouldn't even</i>
<i>be in here without I.D.</i>

577
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:32,996
Okay, uh... He's with me, all right?
He won't drink.

578
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:37,701
What's the problem?

579
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,703
<i>Throw 'em both out.</i>

580
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:47,177
<i>Mr. Hyde!</i>
<i>So this is where you hide.</i>

581
00:42:47,246 --> 00:42:50,013
No, he's Dr. Jekyll today.
Look at him. Grungy.

582
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:52,282
<i>I like it.</i> James,
you're pushin' it, man.

583
00:42:52,351 --> 00:42:55,986
What, uh... I didn't even recognize you
sittin' there. You stop takin' baths?

584
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:59,623
That's funny, man. Funny. <i>Damn!
You know, it's bad enough...</i>

585
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:03,794
we gotta be workin' on a Sunday, and
then we run into our fuckin' boss, huh?

586
00:43:05,864 --> 00:43:09,433
<i>Yeah, you look like you're
workin' your ass off.</i>

587
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:12,969
Look. Gimme a shot of bourbon
with that beer. It's on him.

588
00:43:13,038 --> 00:43:17,507
<i>All right. Him too.</i>
<i>He's... He's 22.</i>

589
00:43:17,576 --> 00:43:20,644
Thank you. What, you
own this place too?

590
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:23,080
Nah, he just lives here.

591
00:43:24,149 --> 00:43:27,317
<i>I thought you were on vacation.</i>

592
00:43:31,056 --> 00:43:33,156
You're livin' here now, huh?

593
00:43:33,225 --> 00:43:35,659
You don't like your new house?
No, I like my house fine.

594
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:38,361
How 'bout Marie?
How she like it?

595
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:42,599
Well... See? See? I

596
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:46,603
What? I told ya you weren't
gonna like it out here.

597
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:49,906
Six months, you and Marie be at each
other's throats. Now it's been what?

598
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:52,075
Half of that?
I fuckin' told ya.

599
00:43:52,144 --> 00:43:54,077
You never said nothin' to me.

600
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:56,079
I shouldn't have had to tell ya.

601
00:43:56,148 --> 00:43:58,815
Marie's a city girl. So are you.
No, I hate the fuckin' city.

602
00:43:58,884 --> 00:44:01,651
Oh, right. And this is
so much better, huh?

603
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,054
Got yourself a little
lawn you can piss on.

604
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:06,690
So what?
This Wonder Bread town.

605
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:09,826
Everybody looks alike, run around
like they all happy and shit...

606
00:44:09,895 --> 00:44:12,095
when they're really
fuckin' miserable.

607
00:44:12,164 --> 00:44:15,065
Just look around ya.
It's bullshit.

608
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:21,771
- Hey, let me get a quarter. <i>- Ja</i> They
ain't got <i>y no</i> no stupid shit.<i>ll right?</i>

609
00:44:25,677 --> 00:44:27,878
Hey, not for nothin', man,
but my taillight is cracked.

610
00:44:27,946 --> 00:44:30,580
Aw, shit.
What happened?

611
00:44:30,649 --> 00:44:33,250
James hit him in the ass. James?

612
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:36,753
I'm teachin' him how to drive stick.
You need more drivers.

613
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:38,755
Fuckin' guys!

614
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:42,993
This cover it?

615
00:44:44,296 --> 00:44:46,763
It's my truck.
It's your truck?

616
00:44:46,832 --> 00:44:48,765
Yeah.
You own that truck?

617
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:52,569
He owns like five trucks.
You own five trucks?

618
00:44:52,638 --> 00:44:54,571
Yeah.

619
00:44:56,141 --> 00:44:59,943
I could use some work, man.
I'm available.

620
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:04,014
I got a mechanic I use
already, man. I'm sorry.

621
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:06,950
No, I mean as a mover.

622
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:09,286
I'm stronger than I look, man.
I can do it.

623
00:45:09,354 --> 00:45:13,256
Uh... Oh... Well, I got
a full crew. I mean, I...

624
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:17,694
Come on, man. Ya don't gotta be a fuckin'
genius to move furniture, do ya?

625
00:45:17,763 --> 00:45:20,664
You gotta have a brain.

626
00:45:32,578 --> 00:45:34,511
Come on.
Just wait a minute.

627
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,613
Just wait one second.

628
00:45:39,885 --> 00:45:41,952
Christ! Bill,
just take it easy.

629
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,954
Slow down.
Slow down, all right?

630
00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:00,070
Bill?

631
00:46:00,138 --> 00:46:03,473
Bill. You gonna sleep
with your clothes on again?

632
00:46:15,454 --> 00:46:18,388
Connie.
Where ya goin'?

633
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:22,392
You wanna go get some breakfast?

634
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:24,861
Don't you ever stop?

635
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,264
No.

636
00:46:27,332 --> 00:46:29,966
I'll see you tomorrow, Tommy.
You'll be all right.

637
00:46:31,203 --> 00:46:33,136
Get some sleep.

638
00:46:38,777 --> 00:46:40,677
<i>Connie.</i>

639
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,647
What am I gonna do?

640
00:46:47,653 --> 00:46:50,420
Yeah!

641
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:52,489
One. Come on.
Let's go.

642
00:46:53,725 --> 00:46:55,759
Hey.
Hey.

643
00:46:55,827 --> 00:46:57,961
What's he doin'? Come on.
What are you doin'?

644
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,963
We don't want any.
Come on!

645
00:47:00,032 --> 00:47:03,967
We don't want any! Hey!
Get away from the truck!

646
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:06,469
Back up, man. You come on.
Come on.

647
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:13,410
Hey, you fuck!
Get away from the truck!

648
00:47:31,997 --> 00:47:34,531
Where's Uncle Al?

649
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:36,266
He... He's not here anymore.

650
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:38,301
When's he comin' back?

651
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:41,137
He's not. He died.

652
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:42,906
Died?

653
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:47,310
<i>Who are you?</i>
I'm Tommy.

654
00:47:47,379 --> 00:47:49,946
Uncle Tommy?
<i>Nah.</i>

655
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,616
Just Tommy.
You want somethin'?

656
00:48:14,673 --> 00:48:16,206
Hey.

657
00:48:16,274 --> 00:48:19,142
<i>Oh. Hey, Deb.</i>

658
00:48:19,211 --> 00:48:22,145
I need some gum.
<i>Help yourself.</i>

659
00:48:26,785 --> 00:48:29,753
I heard you were doin' this
now, but I couldn't believe it.

660
00:48:29,821 --> 00:48:32,455
I haven't seen you in how long?
This is how you treat me?

661
00:48:32,524 --> 00:48:35,525
I'm mad at you.
<i>What for?</i>

662
00:48:35,594 --> 00:48:38,528
What happened between you
and my Aunt Theresa?

663
00:48:38,597 --> 00:48:40,563
Why don't you ask her, not me?

664
00:48:40,632 --> 00:48:43,166
She's smart.

665
00:48:43,235 --> 00:48:45,201
'Cause she hooked up with Rob?
<i>He's smart too.</i>

666
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:48,471
He doesn't cheat on her.

667
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,841
- How old are you now?
- Fourteen.

668
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:55,111
- You're only 14?
- Seventeen, stupid!

669
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,648
- <i> When you gonna be 18?</i>
- <i> Why, you gonna ask me out?</i>

670
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:01,651
I might.
I'm a free man now.

671
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,322
- You're an old man now. - Yeah?
You wanna get out here?

672
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:08,425
Stop! Stop the truck. <i>What?</i>

673
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:11,261
<i>Oh.</i>

674
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:15,131
Hey, Lisa, what do you want? Can I
have a banana cream pie, please?

675
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,434
<i>Banana cream pie?</i>

676
00:49:18,837 --> 00:49:22,939
<i>Uh, we don't have...</i>
<i>Uh, you like fudge bars?</i>

677
00:49:23,008 --> 00:49:24,941
Just give her a fudge bar.

678
00:49:26,077 --> 00:49:29,012
It's dead up there.
You should turn here.

679
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:40,356
Forget this block.
Make a left up there.

680
00:49:40,425 --> 00:49:42,459
That's how Al used to do it.

681
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:49,833
Stop. Don't.

682
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:52,035
It gives me a headache.
Stop, please.

683
00:50:03,882 --> 00:50:07,283
Hey, this is your street.
Yeah, you can drop me off.

684
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:09,419
You're not gonna go all the way with me?
No, I can't.

685
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:11,921
I have to eat. You
should take a break too.

686
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,257
Nobody's gonna be out
again till 7:00 anyway.

687
00:50:15,627 --> 00:50:18,428
I was gonna go home. How
late did my uncle stay out?

688
00:50:18,497 --> 00:50:21,431
9:30, 10:00.
That late?

689
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Man, you need training.

690
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,342
<i>Nice.</i>
<i>Very nice.</i>

691
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:36,479
Get in the house
and help your mother.

692
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,687
<i>Hey, Jerry.</i> You tryin' to
corrupt my daughter or what?

693
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:48,091
I'm sorry. I thought
she was allowed.

694
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,328
Aw, fuck it. You hungry?
You want something to eat?

695
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:54,330
Yeah.

696
00:51:01,072 --> 00:51:04,541
This is excellent, Patty. Yeah,
this is good grub, Patty.

697
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:07,076
You wanna grab us
a couple more beers, please?

698
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:09,879
Thanks.
Hey, Slappy.

699
00:51:09,948 --> 00:51:13,683
<i>You all right over there?</i> It's
good to see you again, Tommy.

700
00:51:13,752 --> 00:51:16,085
Just because you don't go out
with my sister no more...

701
00:51:16,154 --> 00:51:18,588
doesn't mean you can't
stop by once in a while.

702
00:51:18,657 --> 00:51:21,591
No, I know. I will. I mean it.
I missed ya.

703
00:51:22,661 --> 00:51:24,594
I missed you too.

704
00:51:24,663 --> 00:51:28,398
The only reason I went out with Theresa to
begin with was so I could be close to you.

705
00:51:28,466 --> 00:51:31,534
Oh, stop it.

706
00:51:31,603 --> 00:51:33,603
<i>It's true.</i>

707
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:36,906
You know, uh, I used to have
a big crush on you.

708
00:51:36,975 --> 00:51:40,209
Please.

709
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:43,112
Sorry, Jer.

710
00:51:43,181 --> 00:51:45,515
That's all right. You two
wanna go upstairs? Go ahead.

711
00:51:45,584 --> 00:51:48,017
Jerry!
<i>What?</i>

712
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:50,687
It was a joke. He made
a joke, so I made a joke.

713
00:51:50,755 --> 00:51:54,090
<i>Yeah, but his joke was funny.</i>

714
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,094
The only reason I married Patty was
so I could get close to Theresa.

715
00:51:58,163 --> 00:52:00,129
<i>- That's sick!</i>
- <i> What?</i>

716
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:03,600
Aunt Theresa was only 14 when
you and Mom got married. <i>So?</i>

717
00:52:03,668 --> 00:52:05,702
She didn't look 14.

718
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,737
<i>Jerry!</i>

719
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:10,740
<i>What, not funny?</i>
No.

720
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:13,743
Tommy, you want some more roast beef?
Debbie doesn't eat meat.

721
00:52:13,812 --> 00:52:15,244
No?

722
00:52:15,313 --> 00:52:17,246
<i>She's a veggie.</i>
I am not.

723
00:52:17,315 --> 00:52:19,849
<i>What do you mean you're not?</i> I
never said I was vegetarian.

724
00:52:19,918 --> 00:52:21,918
I just don't eat meat
every night. It's gross.

725
00:52:21,987 --> 00:52:24,087
What about chicken? <i>You know
what they do to chickens?</i>

726
00:52:24,155 --> 00:52:27,390
<i>They keep 'em cramped together in little
cages and they peck each other's eyes out.</i>

727
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:31,094
Hey. What did I say about talkin'
about that shit at the table?

728
00:52:31,162 --> 00:52:33,730
- She asked me. -<i> I don't
care what they do to 'em.</i>

729
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:35,765
I don't wanna hear about it
while I'm eatin'.

730
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:39,469
- Tommy, would you have some more?
- No, really, I'm fine.

731
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:41,571
We should go.

732
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:49,612
Hey. You're gonna get me
in trouble again.

733
00:52:50,982 --> 00:52:53,082
Thanks a lot for helpin' me.
Sure.

734
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:55,551
It was fun. You need
some help tomorrow?

735
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,621
You want to? Yeah,
if you want me to.

736
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,491
Yeah, why not? All right.
See ya tomorrow.

737
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,360
It was fun.
Yep.

738
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:06,362
Bye.
Bye.

739
00:53:13,071 --> 00:53:15,271
Don't he look like you?
He doesn't look like me.

740
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,840
He's got a mustache.
He's got tights on.

741
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:20,276
You could have a mustache.

742
00:53:20,345 --> 00:53:22,712
We could get you... I ain't wearin'
no tights. No, thank you.

743
00:53:22,781 --> 00:53:24,747
Anyhow, this is all fixed.

744
00:53:24,816 --> 00:53:27,050
<i>Are you jealous?</i>
<i>Jealous of this guy...</i>

745
00:53:27,118 --> 00:53:29,052
<i>with the tights</i>
<i>and the mustache?</i>

746
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,120
<i>He looks like one</i>
<i>of the village people.</i>

747
00:53:31,189 --> 00:53:33,122
<i>Hey, Stan, where's your glasses?</i>

748
00:53:33,191 --> 00:53:37,226
Billy, Stan got new glasses.
Show him your glasses.

749
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:39,862
He don't like 'em.
Get ready, Bill.

750
00:53:43,368 --> 00:53:46,803
- You look like an idiot!
<i>- Go fuck, Billy!</i>

751
00:53:46,871 --> 00:53:49,806
What'd you say that for? He looks
like Kissinger with the glasses.

752
00:53:49,874 --> 00:53:51,808
I ain't wearin' 'em no more.

753
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:53,810
<i>Now look what you did.</i>
<i>I'm gonna squint.</i>

754
00:53:53,878 --> 00:53:55,778
<i>Ha! He's gonna squint.</i>

755
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:18,301
You think he wants anything? I
don't think he's comin' back out.

756
00:54:37,822 --> 00:54:40,656
Had a dream about you last night.
Really?

757
00:54:40,725 --> 00:54:42,692
Yeah.
You're a jerk.

758
00:54:42,761 --> 00:54:45,161
- What did I do?
<i>- Tell him what you want, honey.</i>

759
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:53,069
Hi. All right, big guy.
What do you want?

760
00:54:53,138 --> 00:54:55,872
Blue cotton candy.
He loves that stuff.

761
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,808
Hey.
How ya doin'?

762
00:54:58,877 --> 00:55:00,810
Hi.

763
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:05,214
- <i> What do you say?</i>
- Thank you.

764
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:08,451
Okay, thanks. Oh. I'm so sorry.
Hold on. Oh, 75 cents.

765
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,020
Here you go.
Keep the change. Okay.

766
00:55:17,462 --> 00:55:19,495
You know her?
<i>Not really.</i>

767
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:21,864
Do you?
<i>Yeah, she's weird.</i>

768
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:24,534
- Why?
- I don't know.

769
00:55:24,602 --> 00:55:27,470
<i>What's her name again?
</i> How should I know?

770
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:30,206
<i>- You just said you knew her.</i>
- What, do you like her?

771
00:55:30,275 --> 00:55:32,341
What do you care?

772
00:55:39,851 --> 00:55:41,984
<i>Watch it, watch it.</i>
Look out, look out.

773
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:47,056
Honey, these will stay here.

774
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:52,195
Why did I even bring
all this stuff?

775
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:54,230
<i>Here.</i>

776
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:56,365
<i>My ice cream really made a mess.</i>

777
00:55:56,434 --> 00:55:59,468
Yeah. Can I get a bite?
You already had one.

778
00:56:01,105 --> 00:56:03,039
All right.

779
00:56:03,107 --> 00:56:05,074
Let me sit down.

780
00:56:05,143 --> 00:56:07,476
Can I get a bite of yours?

781
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:09,645
Why didn't you just get one?
I don't want one.

782
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:13,749
I just want a bite. You always take
the whole sandwich, so don't eat it.

783
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:15,852
Don't let him eat it.
Hey, you pig!

784
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,487
Come on.
I wasn't gonna.

785
00:56:18,556 --> 00:56:20,556
You were too.
I'm not...

786
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,795
Too big? You want me
to put it back?

787
00:56:25,864 --> 00:56:28,731
That is really
disgusting! Ugh!

788
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,034
You don't want it now? Not after
you had your whole mouth on it.

789
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:34,904
Oh, yeah. Throw it away.
It's putrid, disgusting.

790
00:56:39,143 --> 00:56:41,811
Great.
What are you doin'?

791
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,414
Let me have a cigarette. You
gonna smoke in front of her?

792
00:56:51,823 --> 00:56:54,190
You miss Brownie? That's
why I brought him. Mm-hmm.

793
00:56:54,259 --> 00:56:57,126
- Thank you.
- Ruff! Ruff!

794
00:56:59,063 --> 00:57:02,832
I wanna move to the city,
or else upstate. No.

795
00:57:02,901 --> 00:57:05,167
Where's she gonna go
to school in the city?

796
00:57:05,236 --> 00:57:07,970
Huh? You gonna follow her
to class every day?

797
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:11,374
Sit with her so some idiot doesn't blow
her head off? We'll figure it out.

798
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:14,343
I don't wanna move, Mom. We're just
talkin' about it, sweetie, all right?

799
00:57:14,412 --> 00:57:16,512
No, we're not. We're
not talkin' about it?

800
00:57:16,581 --> 00:57:20,016
No. We're not movin'.
Upstate?

801
00:57:20,084 --> 00:57:23,753
I could commute two, three fuckin'
hours every day to go to work? No way.

802
00:57:23,821 --> 00:57:28,024
You don't go to work every day.
You go to a bar every day.

803
00:57:28,092 --> 00:57:31,027
I'm on vacation. Huh! Great.
Some vacation.

804
00:57:31,095 --> 00:57:33,963
You ever heard of Disneyland?
Are we going to Disneyland?

805
00:57:34,032 --> 00:57:35,965
No, no, no.
We're not.

806
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:39,602
Fuck! You shut up! Hey!

807
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:42,538
You don't tell me to shut up.
I tell<i> you</i> to shut up.

808
00:57:42,607 --> 00:57:45,708
Hey! Mike! What? Yeah, hey.

809
00:57:45,777 --> 00:57:48,644
Let's go inside, babe.

810
00:57:48,713 --> 00:57:50,646
Come on. Let me know
when you wanna talk.

811
00:57:50,715 --> 00:57:52,648
Anna, gimme a kiss.

812
00:57:52,717 --> 00:57:54,417
Hi, Mom.
You're back.

813
00:57:54,485 --> 00:57:56,252
How was the movie?
It was all right.

814
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:57,887
Is he staying?
No.

815
00:58:08,866 --> 00:58:12,134
Connie. Can I
get a beer?

816
00:58:12,203 --> 00:58:15,371
What are you looking at?

817
00:58:18,176 --> 00:58:20,109
Are you looking at my tan line?

818
00:58:22,347 --> 00:58:25,481
Hey, Bill.
Did you eat?

819
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:30,086
Did you see the Chinese I left for you?
The noodles? Yeah?

820
00:58:30,154 --> 00:58:32,355
You see my tan?
I got a tan.

821
00:58:32,423 --> 00:58:34,523
I do look tan, right?

822
00:58:34,592 --> 00:58:37,093
Don't I? Yeah, you look...
Yeah, you look great.

823
00:58:37,161 --> 00:58:38,761
I don't look tan.
What?

824
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:43,666
What? I saw you today with
somebody in your ice cream truck.

825
00:58:43,735 --> 00:58:46,002
That's Debbie.
It's Theresa's niece.

826
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,171
Ooh. Nice.
How old is she?

827
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,374
There's nothin' goin' on, Conn.

828
00:58:51,442 --> 00:58:54,777
I just asked how old she is.
She's 17. Why?

829
00:58:54,846 --> 00:58:56,979
I mean, I'm...
I don't... I don't...

830
00:58:57,048 --> 00:59:00,016
I don't come here, I mean, much.

831
00:59:00,084 --> 00:59:02,284
I didn't.
You know, but...

832
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:05,321
You look like you do.

833
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:09,025
Excuse me, hon. You're
gonna have to leave.

834
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:11,460
You have no I.D.
and you're not 21.

835
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:14,597
I am too. I told you,
my purse was stolen.

836
00:59:14,665 --> 00:59:17,366
She's... She's telling you
the truth. I swear it.

837
00:59:17,435 --> 00:59:19,368
You're gonna have to leave too.

838
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:22,905
Why? Why? I-I'm 21. I
showed you my proof.

839
00:59:22,974 --> 00:59:25,541
You lied about your friend here.

840
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,910
- I'm not lying.
<i>- We're waitin' for my boyfriend.</i>

841
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:30,513
He'll tell you how old I am.
Who's your boyfriend?

842
00:59:30,581 --> 00:59:32,848
Tommy Basilio.
Tommy!

843
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:44,126
<i>Eww! Don't lick it</i>
<i>so much.</i>

844
00:59:44,195 --> 00:59:46,662
<i>You too, huh?</i>
What?

845
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:50,066
- <i> Think I'm disgusting?</i>
- <i> I didn't say that.</i>

846
00:59:50,134 --> 00:59:53,235
- <i> Is this good pot?
- </i> -<i> Oh, like you would know the difference.</i>

847
00:59:53,304 --> 00:59:55,738
I don't. That's why I'm asking.
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

848
00:59:58,509 --> 01:00:00,609
It is good.

849
01:00:02,046 --> 01:00:05,047
I get too stoned if it's good.
Oh, it's okay.

850
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:08,784
It's just nice. You're not
gonna get wasted or anything.

851
01:00:08,853 --> 01:00:11,687
It won't get you too high... <i> But
you gotta inhale it, though.</i>

852
01:00:11,756 --> 01:00:14,090
- Or messed up.
<i>- Oh, really.</i>

853
01:00:14,158 --> 01:00:16,525
- Well, she doesn't inhale her cigarettes.
- Get outta here.

854
01:00:16,594 --> 01:00:18,828
<i>You don't.</i> He's right.
You don't.

855
01:00:18,896 --> 01:00:21,630
So what?

856
01:00:21,699 --> 01:00:24,867
That was really beautiful.

857
01:00:24,936 --> 01:00:28,804
"That was really
beautiful."

858
01:00:28,873 --> 01:00:32,241
Wow. I wasn't
laughin' at ya.

859
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:35,211
<i>You were.</i>
I guess I was, huh?

860
01:00:35,279 --> 01:00:39,415
<i>No, with total</i>
<i>respect and wonder.</i>

861
01:00:39,484 --> 01:00:42,284
<i>Ooh.
Oh, that was very...</i>

862
01:00:42,353 --> 01:00:45,054
deep, heavy shit, Mike.

863
01:00:47,758 --> 01:00:50,759
I'm serious.
I know.

864
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:53,996
- Yeah?
- Fuck you.

865
01:00:54,065 --> 01:00:56,532
What?
I'm serious.

866
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:59,735
Me too. Yeah? About what?

867
01:00:59,804 --> 01:01:03,606
About what? Yeah. What
are you serious about?

868
01:01:03,674 --> 01:01:05,508
Anything at all. <i> What
are you talkin' about?</i>

869
01:01:05,576 --> 01:01:08,511
Anything. Would you give me something
that you're serious about?

870
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:10,846
Oh, that's good.

871
01:01:10,915 --> 01:01:13,048
Anything that you're serious about.
What's the matter with you?

872
01:01:13,117 --> 01:01:15,050
<i>Leave him alone!</i>
Just shut up.

873
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,354
I'm askin' him. Don't
tell me to shut up!

874
01:01:18,422 --> 01:01:20,789
You should shut up! Why don't you shut up?
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

875
01:01:20,858 --> 01:01:25,427
<i>Kelly, I am so sorry</i>
<i>that I said shut up.</i>

876
01:01:25,496 --> 01:01:28,964
Seriously?

877
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:30,966
- She's good.
- <i> I know.</i>

878
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:33,035
So that deserves somethin'.

879
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:36,205
Voilà!

880
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:38,207
Ahhh!

881
01:01:38,276 --> 01:01:40,342
<i>You?</i>

882
01:01:40,411 --> 01:01:42,778
Uh, I don't want any.

883
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:47,383
More for us. Uh, nah,
that's all right.

884
01:01:49,253 --> 01:01:53,556
<i>- Amazing.
- Well, I'm gonna go look around.</i>

885
01:01:53,624 --> 01:01:55,157
<i>Hold on.</i>

886
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,030
Do it. I don't care.

887
01:02:01,098 --> 01:02:03,032
<i>I don't want any.</i>

888
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:12,408
Sure.

889
01:02:12,476 --> 01:02:14,543
Might as well.

890
01:02:17,415 --> 01:02:19,481
Come on. Dance with me.
It'll be fun.

891
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:21,850
Come on.
No, I don't wanna dance.

892
01:02:21,919 --> 01:02:25,254
Oh!

893
01:02:27,892 --> 01:02:30,159
Ooh!

894
01:02:47,411 --> 01:02:49,912
Sorry.

895
01:03:00,157 --> 01:03:02,157
Shut up. Shut up!

896
01:03:04,295 --> 01:03:07,596
Oh! What? Everybody's gotta go.
Everybody's gotta go.

897
01:03:07,665 --> 01:03:09,598
Now, now, now!

898
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:11,600
Out! Out! Out! Hey, don't push.
Come on.

899
01:03:11,669 --> 01:03:14,970
Stop pushing us! Go on!
Thanks... for comin'.

900
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,039
Good-bye.

901
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:23,479
Marie?

902
01:03:25,216 --> 01:03:27,149
Hi.

903
01:03:27,218 --> 01:03:30,686
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
So sorry.

904
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:35,024
I know, I know. Me...

905
01:03:35,092 --> 01:03:38,027
Would you get outta here!
Get! I forgot my keys.

906
01:03:39,964 --> 01:03:45,401
Yeah. I know,
I just... I...

907
01:03:45,469 --> 01:03:48,270
Shit!
Will you get out!

908
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:50,406
Go... what...

909
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:54,143
No, nobody.

910
01:03:54,211 --> 01:03:56,145
Noth-Nothing.

911
01:03:56,213 --> 01:04:00,015
Where's Kelly?
She went to the park.

912
01:04:00,084 --> 01:04:03,786
I thought you were supposed to
stay over her house tonight.

913
01:04:03,854 --> 01:04:05,788
I'm really stoned.

914
01:04:05,856 --> 01:04:07,790
You want me to take you home?

915
01:04:07,858 --> 01:04:10,125
No, I'm too stoned.

916
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:12,394
Hey, Deb.
What?

917
01:04:12,463 --> 01:04:15,297
Are you stoned? Eee-ooh-ooh.
Shut up.

918
01:04:15,366 --> 01:04:18,434
Whatever it takes.

919
01:04:18,502 --> 01:04:20,436
Yes.

920
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:23,872
Will you just come home?

921
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:25,908
Please?

922
01:04:35,986 --> 01:04:37,953
It's hot. Careful.

923
01:04:41,025 --> 01:04:43,859
Is it instant?
Yeah.

924
01:04:43,928 --> 01:04:45,928
No, thanks.

925
01:04:47,198 --> 01:04:49,832
Ay-yi!

926
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,934
How ya feelin'?
Pretty beat.

927
01:04:53,437 --> 01:04:56,138
You wanna lay down?
I'll fall asleep.

928
01:04:56,207 --> 01:04:59,141
So what? You're supposed to
be at Kelly's house anyway.

929
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,143
If you fall asleep, I'll take
you home in the morning.

930
01:05:01,212 --> 01:05:06,014
You sure? Yeah. Why don't you take the bed?
I'll sleep on the couch.

931
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:09,718
Do I have to go now? No,
we can go to bed later.

932
01:05:09,787 --> 01:05:12,287
I mean...
You know what I mean.

933
01:05:22,466 --> 01:05:25,968
<i>Nine, 10 bottles of gin
</i> So, tell me about Mike.

934
01:05:26,036 --> 01:05:28,103
Mike?

935
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:38,113
That guy's some kind of a wacko.

936
01:05:38,182 --> 01:05:40,282
<i>Why?</i>

937
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,185
I don't know. There's
somethin' wrong with that guy.

938
01:05:43,254 --> 01:05:46,422
If I had a wife and kid, I
wouldn't be doin' what he's doin'.

939
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:49,425
<i>What does he do?</i>

940
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:52,594
Hangs out at the bar all the time.
He does shitty drugs.

941
01:05:52,663 --> 01:05:54,930
<i>That's what you do.</i>

942
01:05:54,999 --> 01:05:57,032
Yeah, but I'm not him.

943
01:05:57,101 --> 01:06:00,803
<i>So you think if you and Theresa were married
and the kid was yours, you'd be different?</i>

944
01:06:00,871 --> 01:06:03,105
Wait.
Where'd that come from?

945
01:06:03,174 --> 01:06:06,475
<i>You said it.</i> I said if
I had a wife and kid.

946
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:08,610
<i>I didn't say with who.</i>

947
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:11,947
Well, what I meant about Mike was
what does he do for a living?

948
01:06:12,016 --> 01:06:14,016
<i>I don't know. He like
owns some trucks.</i>

949
01:06:14,084 --> 01:06:17,119
<i>He's got a moving company. He's
not really a friend of mine.</i>

950
01:06:17,188 --> 01:06:19,121
Do you have any friends?

951
01:06:21,225 --> 01:06:25,494
What do you mean,
do I have any friends?

952
01:06:25,563 --> 01:06:28,497
- Yeah. -<i> You used to hang
out with my dad a lot, huh?</i>

953
01:06:28,566 --> 01:06:31,533
<i>Well, he kinda had his own crew.</i>

954
01:06:31,602 --> 01:06:34,670
- Your father knew some real sickos.
- Like himself.

955
01:06:34,738 --> 01:06:38,273
<i>Hey, Jerry's all right.</i>
<i>Saved my life once.</i>

956
01:06:38,342 --> 01:06:41,109
What, he was gonna kill you,
but he changed his mind?

957
01:06:41,178 --> 01:06:43,111
No.

958
01:06:44,515 --> 01:06:47,049
One time...

959
01:06:47,117 --> 01:06:49,384
One time this guy
had me by the throat.

960
01:06:49,453 --> 01:06:51,386
This big guy.
<i>Where?</i>

961
01:06:51,455 --> 01:06:53,388
At the Trees.

962
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:55,791
I think I spilled my drink
on him or somethin'.

963
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:59,061
<i>So Jerry picks up one of
those big glass ashtrays?</i>

964
01:06:59,129 --> 01:07:02,431
<i>And he whacks it down
on the guy's head.</i>

965
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,466
He scares me sometimes.

966
01:07:06,504 --> 01:07:09,404
<i>So you used to get</i>
<i>in a lot of fights?</i>

967
01:07:09,473 --> 01:07:11,874
Me? No.

968
01:07:11,942 --> 01:07:15,043
I mean, my friends did
all the time, but, uh...

969
01:07:15,112 --> 01:07:18,113
I was pretty useless when it came to
fights. They kept me around for laughs.

970
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:21,383
Yeah, I remember
when you used to be funny.

971
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:25,454
You remember
when I used to be funny?

972
01:07:25,523 --> 01:07:29,024
Yeah, you and Rob would do<i> The Wizard of
Oz</i> for me when I was little, remember?

973
01:07:29,093 --> 01:07:32,294
Yeah.
<i>The Munchkin Song?</i>

974
01:07:32,363 --> 01:07:35,097
<i>Do it.</i>
Get outta here.

975
01:07:35,165 --> 01:07:37,566
<i>Come on. Please?</i> No way.

976
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:41,036
Just a little bit?

977
01:07:51,482 --> 01:07:55,217
<i>Do the Cowardly Lion.</i> No, forget it.
That's it. No more.

978
01:07:55,286 --> 01:07:58,353
Oh! You used to be good
at imitations.

979
01:08:00,257 --> 01:08:04,259
<i>Yeah, I coulda been somebody.</i>

980
01:08:04,328 --> 01:08:08,597
Instead of an ice cream man, which
is what I am. Let's face it.

981
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,601
<i>Who's that?</i>
What?

982
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:15,871
Was that Jerry Lewis?
<i>Jerry Lewis?</i>

983
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:18,740
You thought that was
Jerry Lewis?

984
01:08:18,809 --> 01:08:20,742
That's it.

985
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:23,312
You're goin' home.
Come on.

986
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,314
Where's your shoes?

987
01:08:26,383 --> 01:08:28,850
Hey! What,
you wanna wrestle?

988
01:08:28,919 --> 01:08:31,153
No.
Come on. I'll show you how.

989
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:33,589
I know how.
I'll whup your ass, Basilio.

990
01:08:33,657 --> 01:08:35,958
Oh, you think so?
Oh, yeah.

991
01:08:36,026 --> 01:08:38,527
Let's see.
Hey, you can't hit!

992
01:08:38,596 --> 01:08:40,596
Why not?

993
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,866
Ow! Jesus!
Ow! Hey!

994
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:48,203
Ow! God!

995
01:08:48,272 --> 01:08:50,339
Ow! I don't wanna
wrestle anymore.

996
01:08:51,575 --> 01:08:53,542
Okay, okay.

997
01:09:00,284 --> 01:09:02,484
What do you wanna do?

998
01:09:02,553 --> 01:09:04,486
I don't know.

999
01:09:09,393 --> 01:09:11,393
You wanna watch TV? No.

1000
01:09:14,231 --> 01:09:16,264
You want me to take you home?

1001
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:18,333
No.

1002
01:10:00,611 --> 01:10:03,111
Is this good here? I'd drive
you further, but, uh...

1003
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:05,447
No, this is fine.

1004
01:10:05,516 --> 01:10:07,449
All right.
I should go.

1005
01:10:07,518 --> 01:10:10,652
Maybe I'll see ya later?
Yeah, I don't know.

1006
01:10:10,721 --> 01:10:13,522
What's the matter? I don't know.
I kinda feel weird.

1007
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:15,657
Don't you?
Why?

1008
01:10:15,726 --> 01:10:19,594
I mean, we just... We just
had some fun, that's all.

1009
01:10:19,663 --> 01:10:21,730
Yeah.

1010
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:23,732
It's all right.

1011
01:10:26,103 --> 01:10:28,036
See ya, Tommy.
Bye.

1012
01:10:30,107 --> 01:10:32,340
Hey.
Don't forget your bag.

1013
01:10:32,409 --> 01:10:34,876
Thanks.

1014
01:10:51,662 --> 01:10:53,729
Oh, Christ!

1015
01:11:01,972 --> 01:11:05,974
- You seen Debbie? - Hey,
Jerry, what are you doin'?

1016
01:11:06,043 --> 01:11:08,410
<i>Lookin' for Debbie. What
are you doin' around here?</i>

1017
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,347
- You're lookin' for Debbie?
- That's what I just said, Tommy.

1018
01:11:12,416 --> 01:11:15,083
She slept over a friend's house
last night, but she snuck out.

1019
01:11:15,152 --> 01:11:17,219
<i>Girl's mother calls</i>
<i>about an hour ago...</i>

1020
01:11:17,287 --> 01:11:19,921
<i>saying her daughter got busted in the
park, and Debbie wasn't with her.</i>

1021
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:22,924
- No? - No! And I'm
fuckin' pissed!

1022
01:11:24,495 --> 01:11:26,862
<i>You at the Trees last night?</i>

1023
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:29,498
Uh, last night? No.

1024
01:11:29,566 --> 01:11:31,800
I mean, uh, no.

1025
01:11:31,869 --> 01:11:34,269
Why? I thought maybe
they were barhoppin'.

1026
01:11:34,338 --> 01:11:37,506
- The girl got caught with a
phony I.D. on her. - Huh.

1027
01:11:41,145 --> 01:11:43,812
Well, what are you doin'
out so early, Tommy?

1028
01:11:43,881 --> 01:11:48,416
Just, uh, goin' to restock the truck. I gotta
get there early before there's a line.

1029
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:54,055
Yeah. Uh, okay, Tommy. Lemme...
Lemme let you go, all right?

1030
01:11:54,124 --> 01:11:57,559
All right, Jer. Well, uh, let me
know if she's all right, all right?

1031
01:11:57,628 --> 01:12:01,763
Oh, yeah.

1032
01:12:07,905 --> 01:12:09,838
Fuck!

1033
01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:27,923
She's home.
Where was she?

1034
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:30,425
I don't know yet. Will you let
me handle this? That's bullshit.

1035
01:12:30,494 --> 01:12:33,261
She's gotta learn.
Jerry, I am warning you.

1036
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:36,998
Hey. I'm goin' upstairs to talk to her.
That's all, all right?

1037
01:12:37,067 --> 01:12:41,136
I'm just askin' you a question.
Where were you?

1038
01:12:41,205 --> 01:12:43,905
Fuckin' leave me alone!
What did you say to me?

1039
01:12:43,974 --> 01:12:45,941
Hey!

1040
01:12:47,244 --> 01:12:49,878
You slam this door
on me? Huh?

1041
01:12:51,315 --> 01:12:53,348
You don't ever slam
the door in my house!

1042
01:13:08,198 --> 01:13:10,632
Hello.
Hi, it's me.

1043
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:15,136
- Theresa?
- No, Debbie.

1044
01:13:15,205 --> 01:13:16,972
Oh.

1045
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,974
What's up?

1046
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:22,811
My Dad threw a shit fit this morning.
Fuckin' wailed on me.

1047
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,114
- He what?
- He went nuts...

1048
01:13:26,183 --> 01:13:29,117
'cause I wouldn't tell him
where I was last night.

1049
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:35,724
Tommy?
Yeah, I'm here.

1050
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:43,064
- Can I come over?
- Uh...

1051
01:13:43,133 --> 01:13:47,702
Well, where's, uh...
Where's Jerry?

1052
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:50,538
He went out. I don't wanna
be here when he gets back.

1053
01:13:50,607 --> 01:13:53,508
Well, I was just about
to take the truck out.

1054
01:13:53,577 --> 01:13:56,511
- Can I come with you?
- Oh.

1055
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:59,681
I don't... I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1056
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:02,717
Why not?

1057
01:14:02,786 --> 01:14:05,553
It... It...
It's just not.

1058
01:14:12,496 --> 01:14:15,397
What do you think we should do?

1059
01:14:15,465 --> 01:14:17,666
What do you mean?

1060
01:14:17,734 --> 01:14:21,770
With my dad. Can you talk to
him, tell him I was with you?

1061
01:14:21,838 --> 01:14:24,906
Ooh.
I don't know, Deb.

1062
01:14:24,975 --> 01:14:27,275
You don't think
we should tell him?

1063
01:14:27,344 --> 01:14:30,578
I, uh...

1064
01:14:31,682 --> 01:14:34,049
I... I... I...

1065
01:14:34,117 --> 01:14:36,084
I can't think straight
right now.

1066
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:43,425
Deb?
What?

1067
01:14:43,493 --> 01:14:46,728
You okay? Did, uh...

1068
01:14:46,797 --> 01:14:49,397
How bad did he...
did he...

1069
01:15:02,913 --> 01:15:05,580
Okay, Billy, easy does it.
Take a little sip. Drink this.

1070
01:15:05,649 --> 01:15:07,716
That's enough. Put it down.
Pass?

1071
01:15:07,784 --> 01:15:09,718
Relax. You better? I'm fine.

1072
01:15:09,786 --> 01:15:11,720
Billy, listen.
You don't look so hot.

1073
01:15:11,788 --> 01:15:13,722
Go upstairs and lay down.

1074
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:16,791
Here, wipe his nose.
Come on, Stan.

1075
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:20,095
Here, Bill. All right.
You all right, Billy?

1076
01:15:20,163 --> 01:15:23,531
How ya doin', Vic?
You work last night?

1077
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,667
No, Connie did.

1078
01:15:25,736 --> 01:15:27,669
She workin' tonight?

1079
01:15:27,738 --> 01:15:29,704
She's supposed
to be here at 4:00.

1080
01:15:32,609 --> 01:15:34,542
Gimme another one, will ya?

1081
01:15:34,611 --> 01:15:37,712
While you're at it, give Billy one.
We almost had him there for a minute.

1082
01:15:37,781 --> 01:15:40,548
Yeah, we almost did have him. That's why
I don't want to give him another one.

1083
01:15:40,617 --> 01:15:42,517
Fuckin' guy don't stop.

1084
01:16:19,656 --> 01:16:21,823
Hey, Deb.
Oh, hey, Tommy.

1085
01:16:23,493 --> 01:16:25,660
This is my friend Puck.
Puck, Tommy.

1086
01:16:25,729 --> 01:16:27,662
Tommy man.
How ya doin'?

1087
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:29,664
What's goin' on?

1088
01:16:29,733 --> 01:16:33,134
Do you remember me? I'm Kevin
Kelly's little brother.

1089
01:16:33,203 --> 01:16:36,304
Eddie. What do
they call you now?

1090
01:16:36,373 --> 01:16:38,807
Puck.

1091
01:16:39,976 --> 01:16:42,744
You play guitar?
<i>Yeah, she's good.</i>

1092
01:16:42,813 --> 01:16:44,913
Let's go.

1093
01:16:44,981 --> 01:16:46,915

You movin' out?
Yep.

1095
01:16:52,422 --> 01:16:54,956
Hey, Tommy man. Can we get a
couple ice creams for the road?

1096
01:16:55,025 --> 01:16:57,725
We don't have time, Eddie.
Let's just go.

1097
01:16:57,794 --> 01:17:00,528
Look, would you just
wait a minute, please?

1098
01:17:00,597 --> 01:17:02,597
Where you movin' to?

1099
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:06,568
I'm movin' in with my cousin Vickie
in the city for a while. All right?

1100
01:17:06,636 --> 01:17:10,872
- I can give you a ride. - And
what, sell ice creams on the way?

1101
01:17:10,941 --> 01:17:13,875
Really, dude, it's cool.
I don't mind takin' her.

1102
01:17:13,944 --> 01:17:16,878
Where's your cousin live?
263 East 10th Street.

1103
01:17:18,715 --> 01:17:21,483
What?
Hey, Deb.

1104
01:17:21,551 --> 01:17:24,319
Are you all right?

1105
01:17:27,624 --> 01:17:29,924
Can we go? We're goin'.
We're goin'.

1106
01:17:33,663 --> 01:17:36,231
Hey, Tommy,
I'll see you later, bro.

1107
01:17:52,949 --> 01:17:56,584
- Who else was here last night?
- I told ya, nobody.

1108
01:17:56,653 --> 01:17:58,586
This guy, uh...

1109
01:17:59,756 --> 01:18:02,190
Tommy, from the bar.

1110
01:18:02,259 --> 01:18:05,193
- What were you guys doin'?
- Hangin' out.

1111
01:18:10,867 --> 01:18:13,334
<i>Ya know, can't I</i>
<i>have people over?</i>

1112
01:18:13,403 --> 01:18:16,804
<i>I thought you said</i>
<i>it was just you and him.</i>

1113
01:18:23,213 --> 01:18:26,347
Ya know, I really don't
wanna talk about this anymore.

1114
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:28,349
Do we have to?

1115
01:18:28,418 --> 01:18:31,319
I'm really glad you're home.
I really am.

1116
01:18:31,388 --> 01:18:33,755
Really.

1117
01:18:33,823 --> 01:18:36,591
So can we just...

1118
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,993
Can we just stop, please?

1119
01:18:44,034 --> 01:18:46,534
You want some ice cream?

1120
01:18:47,804 --> 01:18:50,738
<i>Go to second! Third base!
Third base!</i>

1121
01:18:58,748 --> 01:19:00,682
Here you go. Who gets the change?
Me.

1122
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:02,517
All right, Mommy.

1123
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,688
Anyway, I come back outside.
The other girl left.

1124
01:19:06,756 --> 01:19:09,290
Debbie didn't want to go home,
so she ends up at my place.

1125
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:12,093
- At your place?
- Yeah, which is not cool.

1126
01:19:12,162 --> 01:19:14,329
Hey.
Can I help ya?

1127
01:19:14,397 --> 01:19:16,497
Oh, this is Marie, my wife.

1128
01:19:16,566 --> 01:19:18,900
Oh, hi.

1129
01:19:18,969 --> 01:19:21,302
I'm Tommy.

1130
01:19:21,371 --> 01:19:24,072
Tommy. You're the Tommy
who was over last night.

1131
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:27,408
Uh, yeah.

1132
01:19:27,477 --> 01:19:31,012
We were just, uh... The bar got kinda
crowded, so we were hangin' out.

1133
01:19:31,081 --> 01:19:33,047
Oh.
<i>Hope that's okay.</i>

1134
01:19:33,116 --> 01:19:36,050
Oh, yeah. Sure. <i>You
got a nice place.</i>

1135
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:38,052
Thanks.
Thanks.

1136
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:40,922
<i>Uh, how much?</i>
Uh, five.

1137
01:19:40,991 --> 01:19:45,226
<i>So I guess I'm supposed to ask if there
was anyone else over there with you.</i>

1138
01:19:45,295 --> 01:19:47,228
Like girls, maybe?

1139
01:19:48,765 --> 01:19:52,367
Uh... No. No. It was
just me and Mike.

1140
01:19:52,435 --> 01:19:55,803
Huh. That was
a joke, Tommy.

1141
01:19:55,872 --> 01:19:58,239
Oh.

1142
01:19:58,308 --> 01:20:00,308
Let's go. <i>Yeah, there was about
five or six girls there.</i>

1143
01:20:00,377 --> 01:20:03,177
<i>Oh, really?</i>
Yeah. Naked girls.

1144
01:20:03,246 --> 01:20:06,614
<i>Naked girls? Sounds like fun.
Sorry I missed it.</i>

1145
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:08,616
Yep, me too.
See ya, man.

1146
01:20:08,685 --> 01:20:10,785
Oh, shit.

1147
01:20:10,854 --> 01:20:13,588
She was with you last night,
wasn't she? Fuck!

1148
01:20:13,657 --> 01:20:15,556
Hey, Jerry.
Jerry, take it easy.

1149
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:18,226
- Wasn't she?
- Nothin' happened.

1150
01:20:18,295 --> 01:20:20,361
- I... Jerry!
- Hey! Hey!

1151
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:23,631

1152
01:20:25,402 --> 01:20:28,036
Jerry!
You fuck!

1153
01:20:28,104 --> 01:20:30,271
Jerry, come on, man!

1154
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:33,274
- <i> I fuckin' trusted you!</i>
- <i> Get off the field!</i>

1155
01:20:33,343 --> 01:20:36,144
- Get off the field!
- <i> What happened last night, Michael?</i>

1156
01:20:36,212 --> 01:20:38,946
Would you give me a fuckin' break?
What? What?

1157
01:20:42,385 --> 01:20:45,119
I wish you'd just tell me
the truth for once!

1158
01:20:46,189 --> 01:20:47,922
Ahhh!

1159
01:20:47,991 --> 01:20:49,924
<i>Hey, hey...</i>
<i>Hey, fuck you!</i>

1160
01:20:49,993 --> 01:20:53,361

1163
01:20:58,868 --> 01:21:01,536
I swear to God,

1164
01:21:01,604 --> 01:21:03,871
You're fuckin' dead!
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1165
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:05,873
Get the fuck outta here! <i>Nothin' happened!

1166
01:21:05,942 --> 01:21:09,010

1169
01:21:14,484 --> 01:21:16,451

1170
01:21:16,519 --> 01:21:18,453
<i>You're fuckin' dead!</i>
Come on, man.

1171
01:21:18,521 --> 01:21:20,855
Kiss your fuckin' truck

1172
01:21:23,727 --> 01:21:26,427
<i>Hey, Jerry, come on, man.</i>

1173
01:21:26,496 --> 01:21:28,029
Jerry!

1174
01:21:29,499 --> 01:21:31,466
Oh, man! You like that, Tommy?
Huh?

1175
01:21:31,534 --> 01:21:33,868
That's my truck!
Hey, Jerry!

1176
01:21:36,206 --> 01:21:39,674
Come on, man! I'm sorry, all right?
I should've told ya, okay?

1177
01:21:39,743 --> 01:21:42,744
But, please... You like that, Tommy?
Huh? Huh?

1178
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,481
She's 17 years old!
I... I swe... Ah!

1179
01:22:15,178 --> 01:22:17,111
Fuck you, Tommy.

1180
01:22:32,562 --> 01:22:34,896
You didn't try anything
with Debbie, did ya?

1181
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:40,968
Oh, Tommy. She's like 17.
I know.

1182
01:22:41,037 --> 01:22:43,104
I know, Raymond, but I...

1183
01:22:43,173 --> 01:22:46,174
I swear to God,
nothin' happened.

1184
01:22:46,242 --> 01:22:50,478
She... You know, she ended up
stayin' over and, I don't know...

1185
01:22:50,547 --> 01:22:54,615
We... Nothin' happened. We just ended up
makin' out like a couple of high school kids.

1186
01:22:54,684 --> 01:22:57,785
She is a high school kid.
I know. I was there.

1187
01:23:20,577 --> 01:23:22,777
Hey.

1188
01:23:22,846 --> 01:23:24,979
Hi. I heard
you were here.

1189
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:29,083
Who told you?
Your mother?

1190
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,085
What happened?

1191
01:23:32,722 --> 01:23:35,490
I... I'll tell ya
some other time.

1192
01:23:35,558 --> 01:23:37,492
How you doin'?

1193
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,394
I'm all right.
You look good.

1194
01:23:40,463 --> 01:23:43,130
You just missed the baby.
No, I saw the baby.

1195
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,132
You did?
Yeah.

1196
01:23:45,201 --> 01:23:47,134
Isn't he beautiful?

1197
01:23:48,338 --> 01:23:51,272
He's so little.
He's a little old man.

1198
01:23:53,142 --> 01:23:55,343
Can't they take
some of the wrinkles out?

1199
01:23:55,411 --> 01:23:57,845
Cut it out. You gave birth to Mr.
Magoo.

1200
01:23:59,649 --> 01:24:02,350
No, he's... he's...
he's amazing.

1201
01:24:04,754 --> 01:24:07,154
What are you gonna name him?

1202
01:24:07,223 --> 01:24:10,057
Um, we didn't decide yet.

1203
01:24:18,668 --> 01:24:23,104
<i>Um... I know</i>
<i>when we were goin' out...</i>

1204
01:24:23,172 --> 01:24:26,240
I was a jerk a lot, and, uh,

1205
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:29,544
I treated you like...

1206
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:31,712
Like shit?

1207
01:24:33,116 --> 01:24:35,082
Yeah.

1208
01:24:35,151 --> 01:24:37,084
<i>Yeah?</i>

1209
01:24:38,154 --> 01:24:40,087
Well.

1210
01:24:40,156 --> 01:24:42,089
I'm sorry.

1211
01:24:45,295 --> 01:24:48,529
<i>I was really fucked-up</i>
<i>back then.</i>

1212
01:24:48,598 --> 01:24:51,866
Oh, and you've really straightened
yourself out now, right?

1213
01:24:51,935 --> 01:24:55,036
I would if I had a kid.

1214
01:24:56,372 --> 01:24:58,639
I mean, if we had a kid.

1215
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:01,842
Tommy.
<i>I would.</i>

1216
01:25:04,047 --> 01:25:06,113
I mean, things...

1217
01:25:07,817 --> 01:25:10,351
It was just so much better
when we were together.

1218
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:13,054
You just told me
how fucked-up you were.

1219
01:25:14,123 --> 01:25:16,390
I know, but now I'm even worse.

1220
01:25:17,994 --> 01:25:20,461
I don't know what I'm doin'.
I just, uh...

1221
01:25:24,133 --> 01:25:27,368
I just feel like...
I don't know what I feel.

1222
01:25:27,437 --> 01:25:29,937
I don't...
I don't feel anything.

1223
01:25:33,109 --> 01:25:35,042
Except lost.

1224
01:25:37,814 --> 01:25:41,616
Look, I was stupid to think that
I was gonna change you, right?

1225
01:25:41,684 --> 01:25:45,486
<i>No, I know. I gotta do that
myself and all that shit, but...</i>

1226
01:25:46,689 --> 01:25:48,656
if I had a reason...

1227
01:25:50,593 --> 01:25:54,395
Look, I don't care
if the baby's not mine.

1228
01:25:54,464 --> 01:25:57,965
<i>I don't.</i>
Tommy, stop.

1229
01:26:03,673 --> 01:26:05,773
<i>I'm really tired.</i>

1230
01:26:08,878 --> 01:26:11,312
Well, you mind if I just
sit here for a while?

1231
01:26:12,949 --> 01:26:15,883
Um, Rob is gonna be back
any minute, so...

1232
01:26:25,995 --> 01:26:27,928
Okay.

1233
01:26:39,142 --> 01:26:41,075
I'm sorry.

1234
01:26:46,215 --> 01:26:48,149
Yeah, I know.

1235
01:26:53,222 --> 01:26:55,356
What?

1236
01:26:55,425 --> 01:26:58,359
You're drinking
the whole bottle, Vic.

1237
01:26:58,428 --> 01:27:01,362
<i>This is my last one.</i>
<i>Then I'm gonna go.</i>

1238
01:27:05,268 --> 01:27:07,635
Oh, geez!

1239
01:27:07,704 --> 01:27:10,371
Thought you were Bill.

1240
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,407
What happened to you? Yuck!
Nothin' happened to me.

1241
01:27:13,476 --> 01:27:15,509
Just gimme a Wild
Turkey and a beer.

1242
01:27:15,578 --> 01:27:17,878
Don't talk to me
that way, Tommy!

1243
01:27:17,947 --> 01:27:21,882
I'm sorry. Can I just get my
drink and a beer, please?

1244
01:27:28,558 --> 01:27:31,325
You know, your friend Jerry
was in here this afternoon...

1245
01:27:31,394 --> 01:27:34,729
askin' if I saw you
and his daughter last night.

1246
01:27:34,797 --> 01:27:36,997
Hope I didn't say
the wrong thing.

1247
01:27:37,066 --> 01:27:40,201
Oh, like what? "I think Tommy's
boppin' your daughter, Jer"?

1248
01:27:40,269 --> 01:27:44,238
I only told him what I saw. He
must've drew his own conclusions.

1249
01:27:44,307 --> 01:27:47,241
<i>Looks like he drew a conclusion</i>
<i>on your head.</i>

1250
01:27:49,579 --> 01:27:52,346
"Conclusion on your head."
Yeah, real funny, Connie.

1251
01:27:52,415 --> 01:27:55,583
<i>Hey. You're sittin'</i>
<i>in Billy's seat.</i>

1252
01:27:55,651 --> 01:27:58,319
What is this?
So what?

1253
01:27:58,387 --> 01:28:00,354
No respect.

1254
01:28:00,423 --> 01:28:02,356
<i>Where is he, anyway?</i>

1255
01:28:02,425 --> 01:28:07,161
- He's in the hospital. - He's in
the hospital? Wh-Wh-What happened?

1256
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:10,231
<i>He just stopped</i>
<i>breathing. Yeah.</i>

1257
01:28:10,299 --> 01:28:12,700
Poof. Just like that.
Stopped.

1258
01:28:12,769 --> 01:28:16,137
It's true. Wasn't like he
had an attack or nothin'.

1259
01:28:16,205 --> 01:28:20,541
He just fell off the stool
like all the air went outta him.

1260
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:22,576
Well...

1261
01:28:22,645 --> 01:28:25,646
Shouldn't... Shouldn't somebody
be with him? <i>Yeah, I'm gonna go.</i>

1262
01:28:25,715 --> 01:28:27,715
I'm gonna go in a few minutes.

1263
01:28:27,784 --> 01:28:31,085
<i>Come on.
You've been sayin' that for an hour.</i>

1264
01:28:31,154 --> 01:28:33,621
By the time you get there,
he'll be dead already.

1265
01:28:33,689 --> 01:28:36,157
<i>Hey, I'll go when I feel
like it, all right?</i>

1266
01:28:36,225 --> 01:28:38,292
<i>When I'm ready, then I'll go.</i>

1267
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:40,628
<i>He's gonna be all right.</i>

1268
01:28:40,696 --> 01:28:43,764
Oh, come on. Don't talk
like an idiot, Stan.

1269
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:47,601
Don't call me an idiot, Jackie!
Well, then don't talk like one.

1270
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:50,204
<i>Listen. He's gonna be fine.</i>

1271
01:28:50,273 --> 01:28:53,307
<i>They just have to clean out</i>
<i>his system is all.</i>

1272
01:28:53,376 --> 01:28:56,544
<i>What the hell are you talkin'
about, cleanin' out his system?</i>

1273
01:28:56,612 --> 01:28:59,747
<i>Why don't you just</i>
<i>shut up, Jackie?</i>

1274
01:28:59,816 --> 01:29:03,017
Gimme a quarter, Conn,
for the box.

1275
01:29:03,085 --> 01:29:05,219
You're not gonna play
that song again.

1276
01:29:05,288 --> 01:29:07,888
Just be quiet.
