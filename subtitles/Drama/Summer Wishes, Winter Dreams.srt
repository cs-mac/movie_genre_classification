4
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,280
Xiao Si.

5
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:43,537
You don't have to walk us out.
See you again next time.

6
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,360
- No need to see us out.
- Happy New Year.

7
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,879
Xiao Si, there's something wrong
with your parents today.

8
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,960
Be careful. Don't provoke them.

9
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:55,919
Bye.

10
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:24,159
Xiao Si, come here.
I have questions for you.

11
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,879
What were you doing yesterday?

12
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,319
Don't tell me you were out sketching.
You didn't even bring your sketch pad.

13
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,439
Tell me.

14
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,159
Why did you lie?

15
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,800
I thought I could come back in time.

16
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,439
You thought you could come back in time?

17
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,400
Whether you could and whether you lied
are two different matters.

18
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,800
Xiao Si.

19
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:59,680
You've never lied to me before.

20
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,000
Why?

21
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,199
He's already back. Why look into it?

22
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,560
- What should we eat tonight?
- Eat?

23
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:27,800
Then... if we're not having dinner,
I'll be going to the institute.

24
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,999
All right.

25
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,439
Go to the institute.

26
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,199
We don't have to celebrate the new year!

27
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,040
It's New Year.

28
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:45,399
Like father, like son.

29
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,360
You two are bent on
vexing me, aren't you?

30
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,600
You two don't have to leave today.
I'll leave, okay?

31
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,959
Xiao Si, you can go
wherever you want from now on.

32
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,399
I won't worry anymore.

33
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,160
I won't care anymore, okay?

34
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,199
And you.

35
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,079
You can have your books and airplanes.

36
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,879
You're all disappointing.

37
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,160
Goodbye!

38
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,920
You are on your own now, okay?

39
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,000
What's wrong? Hungry?

40
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,759
A little.

41
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,959
You eat.

42
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,800
No, I was going to
get it for you. You eat.

43
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,579
Let's each have one.

44
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,240
Dad, why don't we go find Mom?

45
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,279
You know your mom's temper.

46
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,560
If we go now, we'll just be
adding fuel to the fire.

47
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,959
That's true.

48
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,240
Why don't we go to the kitchen
to try our luck?

49
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,839
Let's go.

50
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,879
Dad, it's push.

51
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,040
There are so many things.

52
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,319
Is there anything you know
how to make?

53
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,560
It can't be harder than making a plane.

54
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,040
I can make mapo tofu.

55
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,000
There's no tofu.

56
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,639
We can't eat mapo tofu.

57
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,480
Is there something that is
simple yet filling

58
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,079
and can be an entree on its own?

59
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,199
Think about it.

60
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,720
Egg fried rice.

61
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,959
Good idea.

62
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,600
Eggs.

63
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,079
Rice.

64
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,079
Let's go.

65
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,220
Sorry, Xiao Si. I'm sorry.

66
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:18,959
Sorry.

67
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,120
Dad, can you really cook?

68
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,199
I eat at the canteen at work.

69
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,920
What were you flipping the pan for?

70
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,000
That's how the chefs do it on television.

71
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh no, Dad. It's on fire!

72
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Quick, quick! Xiao Si, hurry!

73
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,279
Don't get water.
Get the fire extinguisher!

74
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,799
Hurry, Xiao Si!

75
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:51,960
<i>There are many things in life
you don't notice</i>

76
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,440
<i>because you're already used to them.</i>

77
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,720
<i>When life returns to its
original disorderly state</i>

78
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,279
<i>that's when you'll notice them.</i>

79
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,519
It's the first day of the new year.

80
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,960
There probably won't be anything
more unlucky than this happening.

81
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:18,960
This is bad.

82
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,480
When Mom sees this,
she'll definitely kill us.

83
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,167
That depends on whether
your mom will come back.

84
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,720
<i>Behind those forever fresh
plates of fruit</i>

85
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,679
<i>those spotless floors,
and those warm and dry clothes</i>

86
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,879
<i>are hidden a lot of thought.</i>

87
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,120
<i>You don't want to miss a second of it</i>

88
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,799
<i>because more important than air</i>

89
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,159
<i>are regards from the heart.</i>

90
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,039
Dad, if you had instant noodles,
why didn't you bring them out earlier?

91
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,720
Then we wouldn't have been in such a fix.

92
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,000
I never imagined
it'd be like this either.

93
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,879
It should be bustling with noise
and excitement for the new year.

94
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:21,600
All right, we're fortunate to have
a bowl of hot noodles.

95
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,919
Xiao Si.

96
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,240
Do you know?

97
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,080
This is good.

98
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,759
Back then, I loved eating

99
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,264
your grandma's noodles with
beef and preserved vegetables.

100
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,875
I still remember that flavor.

101
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,639
Later on, I met your mom

102
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,000
and it turned out she likes
this flavor as well.

103
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,200
Dad, how did you know you liked my mom?

104
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,208
You two are like magnets of
the same pole, repelling each other.

105
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:16,375
Back then, your mom was
the Athena of our university.

106
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,000
She had a good family background
and was beautiful.

107
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
Everyone was beneath her notice.

108
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,279
8 out of 10 boys in
our department liked her.

109
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,600
Back then, I was different.

110
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,875
I was still a powerless young fellow.

111
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,440
Don't come again.

112
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,440
I don't even like the things you give me.

113
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,399
Here.

114
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,519
Take them!

115
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,960
Listen up. It's impossible between us.

116
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,879
You hear me?

117
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,440
Wait.

118
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,000
Please come with me to a place
before you make your decision.

119
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,120
Please come in.

120
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,999
This is amazing.

121
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:10,292
You're so amazing.

122
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:12,799
How did you do this?

123
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,120
It's for you.

124
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,679
I...

125
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,679
I'm willing to take the drive I have
for researching airplanes for the country

126
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,159
and invest it into an enthusiastic
pursuit of your affections.

127
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,279
You...

128
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,519
Will you accept me?

129
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,600
You...

130
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,879
Wipe off your sweat first.

131
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:25,519
You're not very good at
saying endearing words.

132
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,240
You don't get it.

133
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,120
You can't use normal methods to
pursue someone like your mom.

134
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,399
Then how did you know Mom liked you?

135
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,759
I didn't know in the beginning either.

136
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,039
Until one day

137
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:55,600
I saw your mom talking with
another male classmate.

138
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,320
I realized I minded.

139
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,679
That's how you knew you liked her?

140
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,919
Of course.

141
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,960
Caring is the beginning of liking.

142
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,160
Since my mom liked you,
why would you two be like this now?

143
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,400
Like how?

144
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,720
A total mess.

145
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,660
Xiao Si.

146
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:27,119
Do you think we're in such a bad state?

147
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,880
You're often busy with work
and don't come home.

148
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,119
When you're back,
you lock yourself in the study.

149
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,440
I get the feeling
you don't really care about Mom.

150
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,960
No, it's because
I care too much about her.

151
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,541
I'm afraid of having a conflict with her
so I'd rather avoid her.

152
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,000
It's like that?

153
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,000
Your mom could never have dreamed

154
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,200
she would be annoyed of my profession
that she once loved.

155
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,839
Life is absurd sometimes.

156
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:17,200
<i>That afternoon, I watched my father</i>

157
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,720
<i>and it seemed like I was
getting to know him again.</i>

158
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,400
<i>He's not considered old.</i>

159
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,240
<i>He's a successful middle-aged man.</i>

160
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,119
<i>His usually determined face
had a weariness I never noticed</i>

161
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:33,279
<i>uneasiness, and an expression
that shows experience.</i>

162
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,880
It's work.

163
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Hello?

164
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,599
It's me.

165
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,500
Right now?

166
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,039
No, I won't be coming in today.

167
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,279
I'm going to spend New Year
with my family.

168
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,559
Yes. Okay, bye.

169
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,599
It's all the way in your hair.

170
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
<i>That was my first deep talk
with my father.</i>

171
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,880
<i>We were on equal footing.</i>

172
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,559
<i>We weren't father and son,
but more like friends.</i>

173
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,880
<i>That was the first time I realized</i>

174
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,599
<i>there are many things that
aren't as simple as they look.</i>

175
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,039
<i>Every relationship is like
river and silt.</i>

176
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,200
<i>The continuous flow
and battering of the waves</i>

177
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,799
<i>change the shape of each other's heart.</i>

178
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:07,980
I'd like to ask you to give me an idea.

179
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,200
What do you think I should do now?

180
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,359
I mean about your mother and I.

181
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,599
You're asking me?

182
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:21,920
You have to win her back.

183
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,279
Good idea.

184
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,559
Thanks, son.

185
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

186
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,819
Change your clothes first, Dad.

187
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,480
This way.

188
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
Dad, do you know where Mom is?

189
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,839
Obviously. She's my wife.

190
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,160
Come on.

191
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,079
Don't be mad anymore.

192
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,000
All right.

193
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,519
Don't be mad.

194
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,640
I was wrong. It's all my fault.

195
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,720
It was all my fault.

196
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,541
Our son is here. Look, he's watching you.

197
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,917
Okay, let's go home.

198
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,680
Our son is waiting to eat.

199
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,880
- I'm starving too.
- Then keep starving.

200
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:04,160
All right, all right.
Come on, let's go home.

201
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,279
Let's go.

202
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,834
Come on, come on.

203
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,839
Let's go.

204
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Your bag.

205
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,759
Dad, you got it.
What miracle drug did you use?

206
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,680
A master can't divulge all his secrets.

207
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,960
I'll teach you when
you'll have a use for it.

208
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,319
<i>What's all this?</i>

209
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,319
<i>I wasn't even gone for half a day.</i>

210
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,362
<i>Xiao Si, look at you.</i>

211
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:58,559
<i>How could you have forgotten to
turn off the water?</i>

212
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,680
<i>Dad, I said not to flip the pan,
but you just had to.</i>

213
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,920
<i>Honestly, you two.
Next time, you guys will leave.</i>

214
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,440
Hello, Mom? How's Dad's mood?

215
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,666
Good, good.

216
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm not bullying Zeus.
I'm treating him well.

217
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,279
All right.

218
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,880
Okay, have fun.
Happy New Year.

219
00:23:57,209 --> 00:23:58,440
Okay, bye.

220
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,660
It's just the two of us.

221
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,559
Cheers.

222
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,119
Dad.

223
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,960
Xiao Si.

224
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,160
Thank you for today.

225
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,200
<i>When we were young, we thought
our parents were invincible.</i>

226
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,519
<i>Only when we stumble upon them
when they feel helpless do we realize</i>

227
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,839
<i>it is because of love that
they were willing to act as heroes.</i>

228
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,519
<i>Every child will experience
such a moment.</i>

229
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,160
<i>They'll suddenly want to grow up faster</i>

230
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,960
<i>and shelter their parents
the way they once sheltered us.</i>

231
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
Li Xia!

232
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:53,359
You're finally here.

233
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,140
Li Xia, did you do
the winter break homework?

234
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,119
I'm not sharing it!

235
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,839
I knew you finished it.

236
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,440
Let me copy it later.

237
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,519
There better not be a next time.

238
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,039
I promise I won't do it again.

239
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,359
Li Xia, you're the best!

240
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,559
Song Ying Ying!

241
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,759
If you keep slacking off,
you'll get even fatter!

242
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,059
Be honest with me.

243
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,440
Did I get fat?

244
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:22,400
I know.

245
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,640
I can never control myself
during New Years.

246
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,160
I need to diet!

247
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:33,279
I brought pastries. Do you want them?

248
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,819
I didn't say anything just now.
I take it back.

249
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,119
This is my favorite.

250
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,960
How come Wen Jing isn't here?

251
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,200
Her?

252
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,640
She must have come across
a hot guy on the street.

253
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,960
You know her.

254
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
A 10-minute trip

255
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,416
can turn into an hour-long trip
if she sees someone to obsess over.

256
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,920
Maybe she's already here
but she didn't bring her luggage in.

257
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,480
All right, I'll leave some for her.

258
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:00,960
It's about time. We should go to class.

259
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,920
Ms. Wenren said we have a class meeting.

260
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,200
Let's hurry and get our things.

261
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,720
I had so much fun during winter break.

262
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,319
It was awesome!

263
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:15,440
Li Xia, Li Xia!
Your Si-Ang idol group is coming!

264
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,279
So handsome.

265
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,999
Good morning.

266
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,880
We won't keep you from your date
with the Si-Ang idol group.

267
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,920
You got this.

268
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,599
You're so gossipy. Leave already.

269
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:57,279
Long time no see.
Did you miss us?

270
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,740
Sure.

271
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,039
I want you to give me back the photo.

272
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,079
What photo?

273
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,720
Didn't you take the photo
under the tabletop glass?

274
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,960
Give it to the one you were thinking of

275
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,839
and your wish will come true.

276
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,119
Doesn't my hat look nice?

277
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,519
Yes, you look good in anything.

278
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,759
Give me back my photo.

279
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,640
Just give it to me.

280
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,240
Give it back to me!

281
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,160
Lu Zhi Ang!

282
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Xiao Si, save me.

283
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,960
Can you not be so immature?

284
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,440
Xiao Si, did you have
a good winter break?

285
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,720
It was good.

286
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,440
You guys can talk. I'm going inside.

287
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,079
What's the matter with him?

288
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,079
That's just how he is,
moody now and then.

289
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,440
He'll be fine later.

290
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,960
I want my photo!

291
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,119
No, no.

292
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,119
- I don't have it.
- Give it back to me!

293
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:13,160
Give it back to me! Give it back!

294
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,960
Hello, Miss.

295
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,440
Nippon Paint's face is becoming
more and more white.

296
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,720
Three things.

297
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,720
First, new semester, new start.

298
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,240
Turn your focus back to studying.

299
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,839
Starting tomorrow, everybody is to
wear the school uniform.

300
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:51,799
Second, the Arts Festival
is coming up soon.

301
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:55,960
The three contestants,
Fu Xiao Si, Li Xia, and Lu Zhi Ang

302
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,160
must perform well.

303
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,640
Especially Fu Xiao Si.

304
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,079
He has been chosen to be the host of
the Arts Festival evening party.

305
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,359
For the rest of the students
who aren't participating

306
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,160
don't go around making a ruckus.

307
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,480
Focus all your energy on studying.

308
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,759
We must rise above the other classes.

309
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,519
And one last thing.

310
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:40,720
This semester, Chen Wen Jing has
transferred to another school.

311
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,759
Her seat will remain empty for now.

312
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,200
Miss, do you know where
Chen Wen Jing transferred to?

313
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,839
I know where students transfer from.

314
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,480
I don't know where they go from here.

315
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,480
All right, that's all for
the class meeting. Class dismissed.

316
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,960
I'm really hungry. Can I eat it?

317
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,400
But that is for Wen Jing.

318
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,920
We've left food for her.

319
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,440
Why did she suddenly transfer?

320
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:01,720
If she were here,
the room wouldn't be so quiet.

321
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,160
If we know her address,
we could send letters to her.

322
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:16,599
Will we never see her transformation
from Braces Girl?

323
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:22,160
Do you think she will miss us?

324
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,400
She will write to us.

325
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,839
I hope so.

326
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,799
Are you participating in
the Arts Festival?

327
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,160
Why don't we enter as a duo?

328
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,480
Okay, let's go.

329
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,079
"Youthfulness, radiance,
talent, rise above."

330
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,209
Arts Festival?

331
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:04,166
"The 16th campus Arts Festival."

332
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:16,680
These are presents I'm giving you
for the new semester.

333
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,880
- This is for Li Xia.
- Thank you.

334
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,559
- Zhi Ang.
- Thank you.

335
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,160
And Xiao Si.

336
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,240
Thank you.

337
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,759
Thank you for preparing gifts for us.

338
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,240
Were you okay that day?

339
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:38,319
Yes. I have to thank you.

340
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,440
What's this between you two?

341
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,000
It’s nothing. It's in the past.

342
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,319
How come yours is so big? Let's swap.

343
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,559
No!

344
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,960
I carefully selected each of your gifts.

345
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,039
Every person's is different.

346
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,400
It's okay. The ugly one fits him.

347
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,480
I'll switch with you.

348
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,799
Immature.

349
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,240
You can swap if you want.

350
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,920
- But don't--
- Wait!

351
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,519
These are gifts
I carefully selected for you.

352
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,719
You're treating it so carelessly.

353
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,079
Not at all. We're happy
we got gifts from you.

354
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,719
Why would we swap them?

355
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,639
All right. Maybe his is empty.

356
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,679
Thank you.

357
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,559
I'll buy something special for you.

358
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,519
- Let's go practice our songs.
- Let's go.

359
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,119
Bye.

360
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:32,280
By the way, did you guys
get home on time?

361
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,760
You weren't scolded, right?

362
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,599
We didn't catch the bus.
We stayed at Li Xia's house.

363
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,599
How come I didn't know?

364
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:43,480
They just stayed the night.
They left the following morning.

365
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,039
You guys could have called me.

366
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,159
You have so many questions.
Let's go practice our songs.

367
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,880
Next time. We'll call you next time.

368
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,000
Let's go.

369
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,280
The art studio is this way.
Where are you going?

370
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:08,800
I'm meeting someone today
so I won't be going to draw.

371
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,000
Xiao Si!

372
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,519
I'm meeting up with Yan Ran.

373
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,599
Li Xia is here too?

374
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,119
Xiao Si and I have been chosen
as hosts for the Arts Festival.

375
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,360
We'll be rehearsing our speeches.

376
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,000
Xiao Si, let's go to the auditorium.

377
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,039
All right.

378
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,840
If you don't need anything,
we'll be leaving now.

379
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,480
Bye.

380
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,800
<i>On the banyan tree by the pond</i>

381
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,840
<i>the cicadas chirp into the summer.</i>

382
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,840
So you guys really stayed overnight
at Li Xia's house?

383
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,360
Yes. You've asked several times already.

384
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,119
You're basically asking
every five minutes.

385
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,079
Why don't I set a timer
and remind you in five minutes?

386
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,159
Why didn't you guys call me?

387
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,760
You could have come to play at my house.

388
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,440
You don't even know
how boring it was for me.

389
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,639
Okay, we'll be sure to
tell you next time. All right?

390
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:41,880
So...

391
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,159
You and Fu Xiao Si slept together
in Li Xia's room?

392
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,840
The two of us have slept together
since we were kids. What about it?

393
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,360
Lu Zhi Ang, have I angered you?

394
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,840
Why are you so impatient
when answering my questions?

395
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,960
I... I'm impatient?

396
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,159
You're the impatient one.
Can you focus on practicing?

397
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,360
No! I'm not practicing anymore!

398
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,400
What's going on with her?
Her mood changes at the drop of a hat.

399
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:21,000
Nobody needs me.
Nobody thinks I'm important.

400
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,340
Nobody told me!

401
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,599
Why is the whole world against me?

402
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,679
March is the season when
sunshine reawakens.

403
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,780
March is the season when flowers bloom.

404
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:59,239
We'll use wisdom and passion
to sow the seeds of hope

405
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:02,039
so art can dwell in our hearts.

406
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,400
Xiao Si.

407
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,239
Do you feel unwell?

408
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,400
No.

409
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,280
It's your turn.

410
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:24,880
Where were we?

411
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,719
We'll use illusions and rainbows.

412
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,920
We'll use illusions and rainbows

413
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,960
to weave our youthful dreams
with no regrets

414
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,760
and let love flow through all corners.

415
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Who wrote this speech? It's so gaudy.

416
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:45,119
I wrote it.

417
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,119
Xiao Si.

418
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,880
I feel our relationship isn't
the same as it was before.

419
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,840
I wanted you to edit my speech
but I couldn't find you.

420
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,079
Even if I found you, you'd be busy.

421
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,840
You don't have time for me anymore.

422
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,119
I get the feeling my best friend since
childhood is distancing himself from me.

423
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:10,320
Xiao Si, can you be nicer to me?

424
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,280
I consider your needs
with everything I do.

425
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,199
You... Can you...

426
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:20,059
Can you not treat me so indifferently?

427
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,480
Okay, okay.

428
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,840
Don't be sad. I'll edit this for you.
I'll edit your speech.

429
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,039
What's wrong? Are you cold?

430
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:12,880
Yes, the wind is... a bit cold.

431
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,960
I have an idea. Wait for me.

432
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,840
Li Xia, Li Xia, Li Xia!

433
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,360
Guess who I saw.

434
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,400
Who?

435
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,440
Fu Xiao Si and Li Yan Ran
leaving together.

436
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,760
That's normal. They're classmates.

437
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,360
Li Yan Ran was sitting on his bike seat.

438
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:53,360
A bike only has one back seat.

439
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,760
Otherwise, she'd be on the handlebars.

440
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,360
They were hugging!

441
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,760
It has nothing to do with me.

442
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,280
Nothing to do with you?

443
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,320
The enemy has breached
far past the front line.

444
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,400
Li Xia, you can't
resign yourself to fate.

445
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,199
Fu Xiao Si and Li Yan Ran
isn't my business

446
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,679
and I can't interfere.

447
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,280
All right.

448
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,840
You won't be cold this way.

449
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,280
The car is nice and warm
and there's a heater.

450
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,079
You won't have to endure the wind.

451
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,840
I won't have to worry now.

452
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,360
Thanks, Xiao Si. You're so thoughtful.

453
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,079
Be careful on the road.
Call me when you get home.

454
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,920
Where would you like to go, Miss?

455
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,519
Just go straight.

456
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,250
He's such an unromantic blockhead.

457
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:47,360
