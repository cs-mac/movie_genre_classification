00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000

2
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,620
Park Do Kyung is a cure-all.
I'm better.

3
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,000
My fever's gone.

4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,000
You had a tough time.

5
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,000
You did it tough.

6
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,620
Both of us.

7
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,970
We had it tough.

8
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,200
If you hadn't persisted,
we'd be over.

9
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,500
Thank you.

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,999
You didn't apologise glibly.

11
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,900
I thought, what if I die?

13
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,950
If I looked back at this time...

14
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,800
I concluded it's nothing.

15
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,890
No need to hold back.

16
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,900
Go as far as my heart takes me.
Don't hold back, just go.

17
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,210
I like that.

18
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,970
"Go as far as my heart takes me.
Don't hold back, just go."

19
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,420
The men I knew held back.

20
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,780
Men who tested the waters.
Calclulating men.

21
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,990
An embarrassed bankrupt
who dumped his woman.

22
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:17,590
None of them moved me
with their perseverance.

24
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,999
I wanted to be moved.

25
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,970
I'm insanely happy now.

26
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,320
If you hold back again,

27
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,700
- I'll kill you.
- Go ahead.

28
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,990
If you waver again,
I won't forgive you.

29
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,800
- I won't to and fro.
- I will to and fro.

30
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,990
Do it. You can.

E14:  SILENCE ALL SOUNDS EXCEPT THOSE OF LOVE

932
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,999
No...

32
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,940
Where were you? Where were you?

33
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,900
In case you died, we checked
the hospital roof!

34
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,330
Where were you?

35
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,840
I got better and left.

36
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,480
You should've told us
you were leaving!

37
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,900
I didn't see you, so I left.

38
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,800
You healed damn fast.

39
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,550
In the vision you saw,

40
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,900
you two broke up.

41
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,930
But in reality you dated...

42
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,790
Then things changed?

43
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,900
It changed! Hey, Do Kyung! Do Kyung!

44
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,500
Congratulations! 

45
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,900
Hey, Park Do Kyung! You won, you rascal!

46
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,000
You changed your fate!

47
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,660
But what's that face?
You're too calm.

48
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,800
Shouldn't you be happier?

49
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,000
I should love her as much
as I can before I leave

51
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,040
to make her happy, right?

52
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,900
Leave? Who's leaving? 

53
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,999
Why will you die?
It changed! Why die?!

54
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,420
Hey, that time...you lost her.

55
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,490
So you had dying regret.

56
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,840
But you're with her
so things changed.

57
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,970
Can't your ending change?!

58
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,280
Predestination has flaws

59
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,310
and famed fortune tellers
can be wrong.

60
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,820
They can't predict what
the heart will do or love will do.

61
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,800
Love!

62
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,970
What? Are you worried?

63
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,500
That you might leave your woman?

64
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,500
Now there's only one thing to do.

65
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,870
To the utmost,

66
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,930
love.

67
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm so jealous!

68
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,990
<i>What are you up to?</i>

69
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,600
<i>I'm off to work.</i>

70
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,830
<i>I just left home. You?</i>

71
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,000
- I'm off to work. - Scared me!

72
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,630
You surprised me!

103
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:08,100
Sheesh.

73
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,210
Morning's so nice with you.

74
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,000
Come on. I'll drive you.

75
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,290
I feel I can do anything,
even kill someone.

77
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,570
Keep it together.

78
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,900
Pick someone to kill for you.

79
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
Oh, alright, Mom. Don't worry.

80
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,620
Of course I won't.
Okay. I love you.

113
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,100
Rooftop party. Rooftop party...

81
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,560
You're a 3 year-old.

82
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,940
No man dances on waking.

83
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,130
- Ask me why I'm like this.
- Just tell me.

84
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,990
I hit the jackpot!

85
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,700
I had an amazing dream.

86
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,690
Mom said to tell no-one...

87
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,510
Keep this quiet, okay?

88
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,430
Mom said it's truly great.

89
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,900
Awesome!

90
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,150
I don't dream much.

91
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,830
This is my first vivid dream.

92
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,900
What did you dream?

93
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,599
The stars in the sky shone like gold dust.

95
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,910
But they moved into a fish shape.

96
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,640
It wiggled, as if it was alive.

97
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,160
Then it fell from the sky.

98
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,170
- I caught it. - You didn't drop it?

99
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,999
For sure! I caught it in my hands. 
Don't doubt me.

100
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:18,900
Anyway, as I woke from my dream...

132
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,500
how can I explain this?

133
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,100
My heart fluttered so much,
but was sinking too.

104
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,720
I felt I heard God's voice.

105
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,400
"This is your time."

106
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,350
- Sell it to me for $5.
- Crazy bastard.

107
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,370
Don't sell that dream,
not even for a million.

108
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,690
Of course I won't!

109
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,500
I might be Attorney-General.

110
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,510
<i>No table manners!</i>

111
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,660
Let's meet for a good dinner.

112
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,150
I know a great steakhouse.

113
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,300
What would you do without me
taking care of you.

114
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,120
So tell your family

115
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,610
before you start showing.

116
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,470
Oh, did you tell that guy? Mr. Brazil?

117
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,570
What is it?

118
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:23,900
You don't have his contact info?

119
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,950
Not even his e-mail?

120
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,250
Oh, that jerk, really.

121
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,680
Tell me his name. 
I'll find out for you.

122
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,160
- He's not the baby's father.
- What?

123
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,400
- What do you mean?
- He's not the father.

124
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,990
What other man do you have?

125
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,260
What? By chance...

126
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,999
- A one-night stand?
- It's not your business.

127
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,950
Oh my god. A one-night stand,
really? 

128
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,099
Mind your own business.

129
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,550
I'll raise the kid by myself.
Only I'll know who the dad is.

131
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not that Brazil guy
so don't disturb his family.

132
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,760
Don't uselessly wonder
who the dad is.

133
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,000
And also...

134
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,510
- I'll emigrate. - What? Why?

135
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,800
In Korea,

136
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,030
I'll get tired of being
asked about the dad.

137
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,750
It's tough on the kid.

138
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,750
I'll raise it overseas.

139
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,790
That's too sad to raise it
alone overseas.

140
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,730
Stay here.
You have Do Kyung and me.

141
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,920
We can all help you.

142
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,097
I won't forget you 
once I hit it big.

143
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,000
Stay! Where would you go?

144
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,700
- Shut up. Forget it.
- You forget it.

145
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,550
I'm late. Let's go.

146

We're here.

147
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,030
Noona. See you tonight!

148
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,700
Okay? Stay strong! Fighting!

151
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,390

How funny.

158
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
You needn't explain.

A man and woman making up

We won't break up, though.

162
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,990
Don't break up. Ever.

We'll go by ourselves. Relax.

335
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,820
We'll get you when we finish.

336
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,730
- Work hard. - Have a nice time!

337
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,660
But is here okay for you?

338
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,130
How about the city 
where you can lie down?

339
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,750
Isn't that better?

340
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,600
- You punk! - Your mouth!

341
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,100
Your mouth is trouble! Jeez.

342
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,500
We're going now.

343
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,970
Let's go.

344
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:33,730
No-one is around. Let's hug.

345
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,950
Here.

346
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,700
It's daytime.

347
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,600
- Let's go.
- So what if it's daytime?

348
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,110
What? What did I do? What?

349
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,610
[ C.E.O. Lee Chan Soo ]

350
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,660
[ C.E.O: Han Tae Jin ]

351
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,640
You waited a while?

352
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,870
Call me first.

353
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,200
I had to go to Customs.

354
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,950
The office expanded. 
Things seem better.

355
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,740
Good follows bad.

356
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,920
Soon after your incident,
sales rose in Europe.

357
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,010
After that, all the banks

358
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,130
that wouldn't budge
began throwing money at us.

359
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:47,800
They wouldn't look at us before
when we begged for loans.

361
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,000
What work should I do?

362
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,490
What can I do?

363
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,870
Take it easy. You just got out.

364
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,700
Did you fix things with Hae Young?

365
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,740
Is it going well?

366
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,650
What's there to work out?

367
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,730
I'll give you back your position.
We went through a lot.

369
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,480
Look after Hae Young first.
Get married.

370
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,250
Don't put work first
and make her sad.

371
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,840
That's the proper order.

372
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,099
Let's go out and eat.

373
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,980
<i>Leave a message after the beep...</i>

374
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,160
Is this Western District Police?

375
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,990
Uh, yes, Oh Hae Young. 
Oh Hae Young, yes.

376
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,990
But they said they're 
from your station.

377
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,900
They took her with them.

378
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,590
- Those guys aren't ours.
- Th-they're not?

379
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,590
Oh dear...

380
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,440
They weren't detectives.

381
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,150
No. They weren't.

382
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,999
- Can you zoom in on that car?
- Yes.

383
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,690
- They're pros. - Pros?

384
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,370
They hid their licence plate.

385
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,999
W-what do we do?

386
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,950
<i>We're the police.</i>

387
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,000
<i>This is Oh Hae Young's house, 
right?</i>

388
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,830
Oh Hae Young was kidnapped
by unidentified men.

389
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,990
So we're in pursuit.

390
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,180
There are two Oh Hae Youngs.

391
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,990
There's another Oh Hae Young
besides my daughter.

392
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,780
- Ma'am. - Ma'am.
- Wake up. - Are you okay?

393
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,600
Ma'am.

394
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:39,390
A dog barking at dusk
in the country...

395
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:43,450
I like that sound at this hour.

396
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,310
On a cold winter morning,

397
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:51,280
people shoveling snow 
while I'm under my blanket.

431
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,700
Scrape, tuk tuk.

398
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,300
Around four p.m,

399
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,800
a little boy running on a hill road.

433
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
Tak tak tak tak tak.

400
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,350
And...

401
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,800
the sound of a music box.

402
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,095
<i>It sounds pretty.</i>

403
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,300
And there's one sound I want to hear.

404
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,099
Your saying my name.

405
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,330
You've never called me Hae Young.

406
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,990
Hae Young is still her, not me, huh?

407
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,080
Oh, sorry. That's petty of me.

408
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,500
You called her that for ages.

410
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,990
I didn't call you that
because of misgivings.

411
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,720
You might think I'm not
referring to you.

412
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,990
You might believe I'm thinking 
of the other Hae Young.

413
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,800
That's true.

414
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,600
But my name is Hae Young.

415
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Just call me by name.

416
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,990
I won't think of the other
Hae Young when I look at you.

450
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:57,800
So be comfortable.

451
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
Call me by my name.

419
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,100
I want a favour too.

420
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,150
No matter what Han Tae Jin
does to me, don't butt in.

421
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,260
Whatever he does,

422
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,240
it's right to take it all.

423
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,640
I was in the wrong.

424
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,100
I even took you from him.

425
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,240
So whatever I go through,

426
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,150
don't get involved.

427
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,370
Don't think of Oh Hae Young
when you look at me.

428
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,700
And let Han Tae Jin punish me.

429
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,530
Let's do that, okay?

430
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,900
And also...

431
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,140
Stop calling me 'that person'.

432
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,930
What's up with that?

433
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,700
What should I call you?

434
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,500
You know, that word...

435
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,990
- What is it? - That.

436
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,490
What is it?

437
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,910
Oppa.

438
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,990
Hae Young.

439
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,900
Oppa.

440
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,740
Hae Young.

441
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,930
Oppa.

442
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,900
Hae Young.

443
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,900
Oppa.

444
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,530
Hae Young.

445
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,900
A little peck?

446
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,900
- Open your eyes. - Huh?

447
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,999
Look up at the stars.

448
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,999
Shall we just die today?

449
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,950
I want to die when I'm happiest.

450
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,510
Park Do Kyung!

451
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,050
Park Do Kyung!

452
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,780
Why don't you answer?

453
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,780
I know you're there!

454
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,370
You're surrounded right now!

455
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,680
What kind of love business is this?

456
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,490
In someone's barley field,

457
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,830
you slacked off all day!

458
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,010
Wrap it up quickly.

459
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,250
Come out now.

460
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,900
Come out now!

461
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,999
Oh my, you do look like detectives.

462
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
You sure do.

463
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,760
Impersonating a cop
and obstruction of justice.

464
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,090
You're in big trouble.

465
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:13,180
- Oh... - Please be kind.
- We were helping Park Do Kyung...

466
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,410
Oh, we're in trouble.

467
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,550
<i>Freaking bastards!</i>

468
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,410
<i>Taking my girl and
putting us through hell!</i>

469
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,010
You hussy! I'll break your legs
and lock you in the house.

471
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,740
I can't live because of you!

472
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,120
<i>You add this crazy stunt
to all the others?</i>

473
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,810
<i>When you come home,</i>

474
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,700
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

475
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,099
<i>You bitch!</i>

476
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,600
I'm sorry.

478
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,000
You can have her.

479
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,000
You keep her.

480
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,999
Just give her to him.

481
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,780
Uh, well...

482
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,300
- How is it? Good?
- It's edible.

483
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,090
That makes me sad.
This is pricey. Jeez.

485
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,600
Are you crazy?

486
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,240
Don't eat pineapple in pregnancy.

487
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,220
You don't know much as a mom.

489
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,530
It's all rumours.

490
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,280
Rumour or not, have awareness.

491
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,910
I want to go home, but I'm 
not going because they say

493
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,080
not to come and go 
in a pregnant woman's home.

494
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,760
Do an Internet search
on the do's and don'ts.

496
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,530
You have time now you can't drink.

497
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,100
Why's she here?

498
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,800
Just a sec.

499
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,350
Oh boy...

500
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,900
Why'd they walk in together?

501
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,850
Why are they here?

502
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,980
What are these women doing?

503
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,240
Don't mind me.

504
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,740
I just came here to eat.

505
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,470
She knows what he is, huh?

506
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:35,900
I do know. Carry on.

507
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,060
I saw your phone.

508
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,970
I wondered how you 'saved' me-

509
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:48,400
as "darling" or just my name?

510
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,990
I was MON. Why MON?

512
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:57,140
But I saw TUE, WED..
THU, FRI, SAT.

514
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:02,050
Ah, no SUN. Your day off?

516
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:07,640
How is it seeing Monday
to Saturday together?

517
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,530
It's no fun ending it alone.

519
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,000
Six of us can beat you up.

520
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,099
Wait, seriously?

521
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:39,760
We can talk about this.

522
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,910
Why do this? This isn't the way!

523
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,910
<i>Cuckoo. Cuckoo.</i>

524
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:51,095
Don't touch him. Just go.

525
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,530
Why dirty your hands?

526
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:57,560
You chased him for his status.

527
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:02,000
- Why butt in, Ajumma?
- I'm Mademoiselle. Miss.

529
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,950
Mon, Tue, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat. 
I'm Dimanche! (FR = Sunday)

530
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,220
Sunday is mine.

531
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,999
We live together.

532
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,160
- You're married?
- No, no. I'm not...

533
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,000
Here's my advice.

534
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,200
Don't focus on appearance, 
job, or money.

535
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,950
Date a man for his character.

536
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,180
Ooh-la-la.

537
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,810
Forget it.

538
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:43,950
You must have character
to judge character.

539
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:49,400
Fine. Keep looking at that,
meeting guys like that.

541
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,970
Fighting!

542
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,800
You, seriously!

942
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:56,200
{\an4}<i>Oh my goodness...</i>

543
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,900
Unni, you're scaring me.

544
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,900
You fight so girly!

564
00:49:12,715 --> 00:49:17,000
This girl! Hey!

545
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:30,120
Thank you. You mopped up in one go.

546
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,890
Women need taming by women. Right?

548
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:41,499
How am I gonna set up my week
all over again?

549
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,950
I'm sorry.

550
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:55,400
Jin Sang.

551
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,240
When you were in high school,

552
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,100
you were utterly adorable.

553
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:09,560
You came home crying 
when your principal died.

554
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,200
You pushed the cart 
around the neighbourhood

555
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,600
for the old trash picker.

572
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,950
That was so adorable.

556
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,240
When you studied with Do Kyung,

557
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:26,000
you two met me at the bus stop 
if it was late.

558
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:28,720
When I got off the bus,

559
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,400
I'd think, "such lovable boys".
It was really nice.

560
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,600
When I think how you were then,

561
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,500
I liked everything about you.

562
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:50,990
I don't know why you changed.

563
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,000
Only you know.
Something happened, huh?

565
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,030
Know what, Jin Sang...

566
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:06,900
You're a very good guy.

567
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,950
Why are you saying this?

568
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,350
You make me want to cry.

569
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:18,850
So quit all this now.
Marry someone nice.

571
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:21,800
And also...

572
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:28,950
Become Attorney-General for real.

573
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,830
<i>I won't tell the kid
you're the dad</i>

574
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:55,990
<i>but I want my kid's dad
to be a good guy,</i>

576
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:02,999
<i>a respectable, cool dad.</i>

577
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,010
<i>Two men joined the company 
at the same time.</i>

578
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:16,760
<i>Let's see how one 
failed at his job. </i>

579
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,890
<i>- Too much. - I'm full.</i>

580
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,160
<i>A lunchtime workout is good. </i>

581
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,470
<i>Excuse me, Na Sang Gyu.
Na Sang Gyu!</i>

582
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:28,060
<i>How can you sleep?</i>

583
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,180
<i>Manager, a post-lunch sleep 
is great. </i>

584
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,160
<i>You young fellow.</i>

585
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,470
<i>Always sleeping after lunch
got you a belly!</i>

586
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,300
<i>Exercise like I do.</i>

587
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,300
Crazy bitch.

588
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,130
What are they thinking?

589
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,630
Just let them be.

590
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:52,900
Forcing them apart won't work.

592
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:58,180
- Your chicken's ready.
- Thank you.

593
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,890
- You don't deliver?
- No, sorry.

594
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:06,690
Well, good food is worth
any distance. Bye.

596
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:09,700
Thanks. Bye.

597
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:21,850
I never dreamed 
I'd bail out Do Kyung.

599
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,100
How'd that dame captivate him?

601
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,720
- She's noisy, so loud.
- He dislikes noisy women.

603
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,160
So she must be amazing somehow.

604
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,140
What's her appeal?

605
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,620
Ask him.

606
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:40,099
Oh my, as if he'd tell me.

607
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,620
Dog Jin Sang, don't drink out of it!

608
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,930
My mouth's as dirty as yours.

609
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,830
Dog Jin Sang, get a cup!

610
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,890
- Get a cup! Get a cup...!
- Nah!

611
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,999
Say it again.

612
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,900
Dog Jin Sang?

613
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,560
You're way younger
yet kicked him?

614
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,850
You dare call him "dog"?

615
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:14,530
What got into you?
I've said it for years.

616
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:20,640
His name *Jin Sang makes him 
seem a *mess. (pun)

617
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,410
But you add 'Dog', 
making it a bigger mess?

619
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,160
Jin Sang is 36.

620
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,240
Will you call him Dog Jin Sang 
at 40?

621
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,760
When he's married with a kid,
you'll call him Dog Jin Sang?

622
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,240
You said it heaps.

623
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,910
Give Jin Sang respect.

624
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,500
And you!

625
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:48,330
Why do you let a younger guy
act rudely to you?

626
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:55,500
If he steps from close to rude,
warn him with a look or word.

629
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,330
Respect is earned

630
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,080
so earn it!

631
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,140
What's with you?

632
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,580
You mistreat him.

633
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,930
It upsets me. Stop.

634
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,890
You abused him!

635
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,990
- What?! - I said stop!

636
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,600
Oh no, I'm getting a feeling!

637
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,840
It's a bad feeling!

638
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,099
What's wrong now?

639
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,950
It's not true.

640
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:48,300
It's not! Say it's not!

641
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,870
What's with you two?

642
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:52,950
Gosh, we never did that!

643
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,000
I didn't do that with you!

644
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,000
Oh no! It makes no sense!

647
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,500
That dream.

645
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,099
That dream!

646
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:10,850
You're right.

647
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,800
It was a Tae-Mong. 
(conception dream)

648
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,430
- No! - Crazy bastard!

649
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,600
- Crazy bastard! - Wasn't me!

650
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,370
No way. Wait! It wasn't me. 

651
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,580
It wasn't me.

652
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,930
Hey, who's pitiable?

653
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,280
Who's pitiable?!

654
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,500
For the crime of womanising,

655
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,500
you're sentenced to life with 
Soo Kyung. Bang-bang-bang!

656
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:47,030
Damnit! Sheesh!

657
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,080
Here, grab him! 

658
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,080
Hey!

659
00:56:52,095 --> 00:56:56,080
- Come here! Grab him!
- No! Hold on. No!

660
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,930
Dog Jin Sang has no right 
to silence!

661
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:02,000
- No! - Sheesh.

662
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,000
Will it be tough on you?

663
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,950
Will it work?

664
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,500
Hae Young.

665
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:24,900
Hae Young.

666
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,060
Oppa.

667
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,900
<i>Hae Young.</i>

668
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,940
Oppa.

669
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,760
Hae Young.

670
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,600
-<i>Oppa.</i> - Hae Young.

671
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,830
Mm, Oppa.

672
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,500
Hae Young.

673
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:49,000
Oppa.

674
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,400
<i>Hae Young.</i>

675
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,099
Mm, Oppa.

676
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,900
Hae Young.

677
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,900
I'm sorry.

678
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:22,400
I know I'm at my craziest.

679
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:27,500
I won't ask you to forgive him...

680
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:33,000
nor to forgive me.

681
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,800
I'll take all the blame.

682
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,999
Seriously...

683
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,900
You made a fool of me.

684
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,200
I'm sorry.

685
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:52,990
Oppa.

686
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:56,510
- Going somewhere?
- A blind date.

687
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:03,600
How thoughtless after 
I told you I loved you.

689
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,850
But I accepted this blind date
before that.

690
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,450
Sorry.

691
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,900
I'm glad you're going 
on blind dates.

692
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:17,450
- I'm late for the date. 
- Sure. Go.

693
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:20,100
See you next time.

694
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:25,100
Let's get a drink with 
Hae Young some time.

695
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,990
Sure.

696
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:21,560
<i>The deep love you'd die for...</i>

697
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,460
<i>can be the pain to make
another want to die.</i>

698
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:31,990
<i>But it can't be helped. 
My love is precious.</i>

699
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:38,400
Okay.

700
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:42,160
Seriously?

701
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,630
- It's done. - It is?

702
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,500
This is fascinating.

729
01:05:49,465 --> 01:05:55,000
{\an8}<i>~ Please know I want to be close to you ~</i>

730
01:05:57,635 --> 01:06:03,995
{\an8}<i>~ If you do, please answer me ~</i>

703
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:11,090
I want to call him... 
to say we're dating.

732
01:06:09,735 --> 01:06:13,664
{\an8}<i>~ All your hidden, painful scars ~</i>

733
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:20,900
{\an8}<i>~ Give them all to me ~</i>

734
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:29,395
{\an8}<i>~ So you won't be sad and weary ~</i>

735
01:06:29,435 --> 01:06:35,000
{\an8}<i>~ Let me be closer to you ~</i>

905
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,480
Hi.

705
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:45,200
Yes. My father owned this house.

706
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,600
I heard you wanted to buy it.

707
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:52,990
Do you still want to buy it?

708
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,980
<i>My father passed away.</i>

709
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,199
My father passed away.

710
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,260
<i>Let's beg him.</i>

711
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,310
<i>...we ended back 
with the right people.</i>

712
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:10,080
<i>The woman who lived here...</i>

713
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,910
<i>- Meet twice to be polite.
- Which Oh Hae Young...</i>

714
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,900
Too hot!

715
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:48,095
<i>I burned my hand.</i>

716
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,900
Luckily it's my left hand.

717
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:27,550
I was braising beef
and spilled it.

718
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,860
I always mess up at new things.

719
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:32,600
You haven't eaten, have you?

720
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,098
Ta-da!

721
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:56,740
Get hurt, die.

722
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,990
So things won't change?

723
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,270
What's it all about?
