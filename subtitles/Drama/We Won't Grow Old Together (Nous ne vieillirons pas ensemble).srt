2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:11,805
(This program is about 2 MCs)

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,205
(who are praised and survived)

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,697
(in a jungle of variety shows.)

5
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:16,406
(This is a documentary about these two)

6
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,058
(going on a trip to find dinner.)

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,125
In a heart of the mountain...

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,961
A sound of wooden bell coming out

9
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:22,961
from a temple...

10
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,055
Why did two sinners come to this temple?

11
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:32,594
Kyung-kyu!

12
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:35,018
We're in Gangnam!

13
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:37,422
We're in the middle of Gangnam!

14
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:38,938
Samsungdong.

15
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:41,021
That's Bongeun Temple!

16
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,381
(Now that he mentioned it...)

17
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:45,906
(It's right in the middle of a city.)

18
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,688
I heard it's 1,200 years old.

19
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:49,109
1,200 years?

20
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,109
Yes.

21
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:52,848
That's pretty cool.

22
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:55,188
Those Chinese characters mean...

23
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:56,938
Receiving luck.

24
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,188
No, receiving grace.

25
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:01,016
A temple where you receive grace.

26
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:02,219
It sits on an amazing land.

27
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,266
Why?

28
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:04,445
It's great.

29
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:07,037
This whole area is really expensive.

30
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:08,172
That's COEX!

31
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:10,219
KEPCO used to be here

32
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:12,907
but they sold the site to Hyundai

33
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:15,344
for 2 billion dollars.

34
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:18,703
This place...

35
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:20,076
Is incredible!

36
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:23,642
This place is priceless!

37
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:26,538
Before Kyung-kyu starts feeling greedy,

38
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,436
they head into a 1,200 years old temple.

39
00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:31,646
A lot of foreigners.

40
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:32,875
Ask them something.

41
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:33,875
Should I?

42
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:38,016
Belgium.

43
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:40,280
(Tourists from Belgium.)

44
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:45,883
(To visit Bongeun Temple.)

45
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:47,095
How do you like it?

46
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:50,320
(He was doing so well at first...)

47
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:52,402
(Frustrated.)

48
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:55,399
What do you think about Bongeun Temple?

49
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,923
Can you tell them it's 1,200 years old?

50
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:06,500
It was made over a thousand years ago.

51
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:16,563
(Got his numbers confused.)

52
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,836
(It became 10,000 years old now...)

53
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,327
1,200 years ago.

54
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:23,781
This temple?

55
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,856
1,000 is one thousand!

56
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:34,737
(Finally understands.)

57
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,578
Are you guys friends?

58
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,408
She's my cousin.

59
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:40,660
Have a nice day.

60
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:42,968
Thank you.

61
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,294
(A Buddhist farewell.)

62
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,469
Kyung-kyu.

63
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:50,553
Do you realize something?

64
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,192
Nature this way.

65
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:53,730
There's a mountain

66
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:55,438
But look this way.

67
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,680
Look at all those buildings!

68
00:02:58,422 --> 00:02:59,625
That's a forest of trees.

69
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:01,563
That's a forest of buildings.

70
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,622
An awesome sight of an old temple

71
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,031
in the middle of tall, modern buildings.

72
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:09,484
This temple is a time machine

73
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,016
that can travel 1,000 years.

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,195
And this is where today's guests are.

75
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,539
They must be here somewhere.

76
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:16,484
It's about time they come out.

77
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:17,445
Really?

78
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,797
We have incredible guests.

79
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:20,039
We have to stay alert.

80
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,039
Really?

81
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,990
You might face harsh internet comments.

82
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:26,813
I gave you enough hints.

83
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:28,359
You'll like them.

84
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:29,359
Really?

85
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:31,844
Wait.

86
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:33,606
Is that our guest?

87
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,609
(She's just praying...)

88
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:39,297
You need to read the news...

89
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,430
Today's guests...

90
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:46,786
Are one of your favorites.

91
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:49,754
You said the name all the time!

92
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,115
(Let's see...)

93
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:56,781
It's already on the news!

94
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:58,547
(he just yells the most famous people)

95
00:03:58,547 --> 00:03:59,614
(that he knows.)

96
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,133
BTS!

97
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,726
(Even in front of Wanna One...)

98
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,073
BTS!

99
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,375
(Are they really here today?)

100
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,229
(No way...)

101
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,422
Is it really BTS?

102
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,195
Are they here?

103
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,541
(They go inside to look for the guests.)

104
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,750
(Careful.)

105
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,750
Over there.

106
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,070
I think that's them.

107
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,332
Should we go in?

108
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:27,980
(Who could it be?)

109
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:30,891
(Walks in quietly.)

110
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:33,781
(They're concentrating on calligraphy)

111
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:36,248
(in a quiet, 1,000 years old temple.)

112
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,616
(Let's see...)

113
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:43,742
(Shows respect to the monk first.)

114
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:44,773
Hello.

115
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:48,915
Sir, we're looking for our guests.

116
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:50,859
Food?

117
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:51,898
Guests.

118
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:55,147
A friend to eat with today...

119
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,391
Welcome.

120
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:58,588
We're doing calligraphy.

121
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,492
(Practicing hard.)

122
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:03,559
Have you ever watched our show before?

123
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:05,413
I'll start from now on.

124
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:07,547
(Please do!)

125
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:08,814
Please take a seat.

126
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:10,196
But these guys...

127
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:11,971
Are they your students?

128
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:14,250
Today's their first day.

129
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:16,328
Sir...

130
00:05:17,406 --> 00:05:19,148
Do you know who they are?

131
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:20,609
I think...

132
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,389
They were BTS?

133
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:26,449
(An unexpected exposure...)

134
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,683
People in other countries call them BTS.

135
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:34,796
They were even on the Billboard.

136
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:36,023
Really?

137
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,164
They won a huge award just now.

138
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:43,128
They're my favorite idols.

139
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,109
Really?

140
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,918
(Nice to meet you.)

141
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,797
Then could you sing...

142
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,219
What was it...

143
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,289
Pop?

144
00:05:52,406 --> 00:05:53,406
Hip hop?

145
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,226
Could I listen to you guys sing?

146
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:57,875
(Jung-gook starts first.)

147
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:13,653
(Good job.)

148
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:15,954
(Jin's turn.)

149
00:06:24,695 --> 00:06:27,212
(That's my BTS.)

150
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:29,382
They're good songs.

151
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:32,990
If they're really popular,

152
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,155
you guys will succeed today.

153
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,594
Don't worry.

154
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,503
And good luck.

155
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,111
Thanks for your time.

156
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,727
Hi.

157
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:48,628
(They're finally here.)

158
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,477
You got lucky this time.

159
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,641
I know who they are.

160
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:52,727
Who?

161
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:54,641
Jin, Jung-gook.

162
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:58,159
Do you know all 7 of us?

163
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:00,453
Why would I know that?

164
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:02,922
Kyung-kyu have been waiting for them

165
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,922
to come to our show.

166
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,563
An idol that took the world by a storm.

167
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:10,124
Jin, their oldest member

168
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,116
Jung-gook, the youngest, are here.

169
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,188
Where will they go test their fate today?

170
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,906
Samsungdong, Gangnam-ku, Seoul.

171
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:22,172
Samsungdong is the focus

172
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:24,361
of trades and finances.

173
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,391
It's the focal point of buyers

174
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,727
from all over the world.

175
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,672
With a lot of expensive houses

176
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:35,672
and apartments,

177
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:38,047
it's one of the wealthiest areas

178
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:39,609
in Korea.

179
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,969
With BTS that conquered the world,

180
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:47,316
can they conquer a meal too?

181
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,891
Let's Have Dinner Together ep. 50

182
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:52,490
Rice, Sweats, Tears.

183
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:56,063
BTS!

184
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:02,133
(Kyung-kyu's favorite idol is here.)

185
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,895
BTS is here!

186
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:05,547
Us too!

187
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:11,766
(Jung-gook and Jin are today's guests.)

188
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,813
They're back with a new song!

189
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:16,282
Where do you live?

190
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:17,492
Manduk in Busan.

191
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:18,906
Manduk?

192
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:19,938
Yes.

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Choryang!

194
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:22,641
Choryang?

195
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:23,656
He's their mascot!

196
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,711
Really?

197
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:26,609
You don't know the big 3 in Busan?

198
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:28,211
Lotte Giants.

199
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:29,391
I know Giants.

200
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:30,969
Haewoondae.

201
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,067
I know that too.

202
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:33,438
Lee Kyung-kyu, old man.

203
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,639
(Let's get going guys...)

204
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:41,023
Swag!

205
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,984
That's COEX, the biggest convention center

206
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:44,984
in Asia.

207
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:48,570
It's huge!

208
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:50,922
What exactly is COEX for?

209
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:53,021
Isn't it a movie theater?

210
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:54,975
It's a trade center...

211
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:58,063
I'm sure it has a movie theater!

212
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,381
They hold conventions.

213
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:03,000
A lot of exhibitions too.

214
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,805
That's the Tehran Street.

215
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,515
Isn't that a big road?

216
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,242
Why do you think it's called

217
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:10,242
Tehran Street?

218
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,724
Star Craft?

219
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:16,464
(That's Terran...)

220
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:19,953
Tehran is Iran's capital.

221
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,008
Iran's capital.

222
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:25,578
When the mayor of Tehran came to Seoul,

223
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,233
we changed its name to celebrate

224
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:28,581
that moment.

225
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,897
It was in the 70s.

226
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:32,393
Since then, it's become Tehran Street.

227
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,272
(Iran has a Seoul Street too!)

228
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:37,850
That's a cool story!

229
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:41,586
(They're walking on Tehran Street now...)

230
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:43,806
Jin loves dad jokes!

231
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:46,562
What kind of dad jokes?

232
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:50,217
How do you say don't fart in English?

233
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:52,241
Don't fart in English?

234
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:53,834
Don't Gas.

235
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,795
He's loving it!

236
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:00,796
(Stuck Kyung-kyu's chords.)

237
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:04,913
What happens when you pass the limit?

238
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:06,886
Pass your limit?

239
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,786
Two!

240
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:11,815
(That's it!)

241
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:14,343
Writers are laughing too!

242
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:17,019
(Unbelievable but funny...)

243
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:19,436
There's nothing special to what he says!

244
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:21,233
It's just 2!

245
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,142
Do you have about 500 of these?

246
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,395
Only about 400.

247
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
400?

248
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:31,480
Jin never closes his eyes.

249
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:33,413
He's good at staring contests.

250
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:34,772
Ready!

251
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:36,182
Staring contest!

252
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,866
Jin vs. Kyung-kyu!

253
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:40,906
Who ever blinks first loses!

254
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:42,053
Ready...

255
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:43,858
Are you ready?

256
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:45,170
Go!

257
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,536
(A staring contest in Samsungdong...)

258
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,632
(He's been spinning his eyes for 30 years.)

259
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:53,980
(But Jin's the best within all idols.)

260
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:57,309
(The match of the century.)

261
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,568
(Shocked.)

262
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,288
(Surprise attack.)

263
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,904
His eyes move so fast!

264
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:11,475
(Can't hold Jin's eyeballs attack...)

265
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,058
I won!

266
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,639
(The fall of the master...)

267
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:19,475
What high school is that?

268
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:20,875
Gyeonggi High School.

269
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:22,535
That's Gyeonggi High School?

270
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:25,145
A lot of smart students went there.

271
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:26,991
It was a prestigious school.

272
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,897
(Bang Si-hyuk, a producer who made BTS)

273
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,007
(graduated from this school.)

274
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:32,881
This is known as the

275
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:34,717
Gyeonggi High School Intersection.

276
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:36,850
I remember that bus stop!

277
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:41,237
(In the middle of tall buildings.)

278
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,459
The entire place was a field before!

279
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:44,827
Here?

280
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,290
There was nothing here!

281
00:11:46,897 --> 00:11:48,131
When he was in college!

282
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:49,178
Really?

283
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,444
There were absolutely nothing here

284
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,655
except for rice paddies and fields.

285
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:55,487
(Gangnam that Kyung-kyu remembers...)

286
00:11:56,428 --> 00:11:58,437
Just 40 years ago,

287
00:11:58,702 --> 00:12:00,631
it was full of rice paddies and fields.

288
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,483
Gangnam was not a wealthy neighborhood

289
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:03,506
that it is today.

290
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:05,311
After 1960,

291
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:07,491
because of a rapid increase in population,

292
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:08,850
the old town area was muddled

293
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,250
with over population,

294
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:14,387
the government decided to develop this area

295
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:17,069
to expand the city.

296
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:19,309
The result...

297
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,997
Saw Gangnam become the most expensive

298
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:22,754
area in Korea and is making Kyung-kyu

299
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:23,954
regret his past choices.

300
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:25,192
That's when...

301
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:28,956
Do you know what his biggest regret is?

302
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,066
He studied.

303
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:33,606
I was in college.

304
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:35,083
If I bought real estate here

305
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:36,856
with my tuition...

306
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,575
I could've built my own university!

307
00:12:39,997 --> 00:12:41,809
This is a disaster!

308
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,350
This place is golden now!

309
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:47,178
It used to be a field!

310
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:50,309
That's why everyone's rich here!

311
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:52,673
Wouldn't it get even more expensive?

312
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,372
Wouldn't it get more expensive?

313
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:57,070
Buy it now!

314
00:12:57,137 --> 00:12:58,713
Just in case it does go up!

315
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,585
I'll go talk to the mayor

316
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,791
and make a BTS Street!

317
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,774
From over there to over there!

318
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:07,075
Thanks!

319
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,558
A lot of our fans heard that.

320
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:11,351
Let's go make BTS Street!

321
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,144
(They start walking around again.)

322
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:16,735
Is this Samsungdong too?

323
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:17,794
Yup.

324
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,707
(They have to find a residential area...)

325
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:23,095
I don't think I saw houses here.

326
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,809
Me neither.

327
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:27,270
I only passed business districts.

328
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,294
Let's go talk to a real estate agent.

329
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,840
We need to familiarize ourselves to here.

330
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Exactly.

331
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,536
This is important to Jin.

332
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:38,492
How much is this building?

333
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:41,008
You and Jin have a lot in common.

334
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,762
This place smells nice.

335
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:45,907
You're working on a Sunday too?

336
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:49,557
(They shot on Sunday this time.)

337
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:50,680
Can we sit down?

338
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:51,809
Sure.

339
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:52,926
Where are we?

340
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,434
That's where this office is.

341
00:13:57,356 --> 00:14:00,111
If you take a look around here,

342
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:01,684
this read area,

343
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,104
that's a designated residential area.

344
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:05,926
Designated residential area?

345
00:14:05,997 --> 00:14:09,231
Buildings can't be higher than 2 stories.

346
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,709
They're mostly houses.

347
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:14,861
 (This is it!)

348
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,549
House size are between 251 and 561

349
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:17,942
square meters.

350
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,809
The smallest one is 251 sq. meters?

351
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:22,325
Some are smaller...

352
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,208
But most of them have yards.

353
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,208
In Seoul?

354
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,253
Most people who live there

355
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,271
are either celebrities or CEOs.

356
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:32,684
Really?

357
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,971
Do you know any celebrities who live there?

358
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:37,167
Jun Ji-hyun, Song Hye-kyo.

359
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,590
Yoo Ho-jeong and Lee Jae-ryong.

360
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:42,887
Is it because it's close to Daechidong?

361
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:43,864
Exactly.

362
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:45,153
There are a lot of great

363
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:46,567
private educations there.

364
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:49,122
That's why a lot of people live here

365
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,817
and Cheongdamdong.

366
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:53,520
What's special about houses in Samsungdong?

367
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,469
They're expensive.

368
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,661
If you only count the houses,

369
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:00,544
Samsungdong is the most expensive place

370
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,298
in Gangnam.

371
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:03,856
More than Cheongdamdong?

372
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,004
Yup.

373
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:07,028
Normally, Gangnam's houses cost

374
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,624
$40,000 per sq. meters.

375
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:11,036
But now, it's way more than $40,000.

376
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,919
Some are $50,000 or $55,000 even.

377
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,372
Some houses here cost $60,000.

378
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,372
Monthly rent?

379
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:17,442
No, per sq. meter.

380
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,919
I thought the rent was $60,000.

381
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:22,900
Are you losing it?

382
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:24,872
What's the age group here?

383
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:26,364
Not a lot of young people.

384
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:29,269
People here are mostly old.

385
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,772
So we won't find a lot of people

386
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:32,903
who eat alone?

387
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,208
Not much.

388
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:36,684
But there are some townhouses here too.

389
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:40,544
(Just behind Gyeonggi High School...)

390
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:43,794
(There are a lot of townhouses

391
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:45,442
or condos too!)

392
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:46,950
No studios?

393
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:48,426
There are some.

394
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:49,426
Really?

395
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:51,184
They're not in this residential area.

396
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,319
It's a bit far.

397
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:54,089
What kind of people live here?

398
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:55,637
People who work nearby.

399
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:56,637
I see.

400
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:57,794
The rent is around $700

401
00:15:57,848 --> 00:15:59,182
with $1,000 deposit.

402
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:02,129
Do you think we'll succeed today?

403
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:06,208
It might be tough...

404
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,758
A lot of people go out on weekends.

405
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:12,950
People go out to eat.

406
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,615
It's 5:30 right now.

407
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:16,385
Let's hurry.

408
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:17,426
We'll get going then.

409
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:18,504
Thank you.

410
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:19,872
This was expected.

411
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:21,930
Having a meal here will be difficult.

412
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:24,090
Will they be able to open the doors

413
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,090
in Samsungdong?

414
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:29,872
This is the residential area.

415
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,822
Is this the place he told us about?

416
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:33,254
Yes.

417
00:16:33,754 --> 00:16:35,434
I've never been here before.

418
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:36,434
Me too.

419
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:39,806
I didn't know this even existed!

420
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:42,558
I only saw tall buildings.

421
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,528
I would love to live in a quiet place

422
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:45,528
like this.

423
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,293
It'll be peaceful here at night.

424
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,911
This place is huge but it's so quiet.

425
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:51,247
Maybe everyone's out.

426
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:54,691
(Quiet.)

427
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:58,317
There's no one walking around even!

428
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:01,239
(Quiet and empty streets.)

429
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,278
Look, there's no one there.

430
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,938
Is it because today's Sunday?

431
00:17:04,997 --> 00:17:06,817
It's like this on weekends too.

432
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,539
Oh, people go to work.

433
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:11,085
Maybe it's the mountain

434
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:12,536
next to Bongeun Temple...

435
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:15,255
But there are a lot of trees here.

436
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,287
This kinda feels like Yangpyeong.

437
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:19,294
Or a country house.

438
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:20,770
The air seems fresh too.

439
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:21,794
So quiet.

440
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:23,512
And they really do have yards!

441
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:29,856
That's a huge persimmon tree!

442
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,876
They all are.

443
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,590
They're starting to ripe!

444
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:35,864
(Autumn is coming.)

445
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:39,222
They're turning yellow from the bottom.

446
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:41,184
Those dates are becoming ripe too.

447
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:47,276
(Met traces of Autumn in Samsungdong.)

448
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:51,247
Ho-dong!

449
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:53,969
Finger print scanner!

450
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:55,942
That's so cool.

451
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:57,590
I've never seen it before.

452
00:17:57,622 --> 00:17:58,622
Really?

453
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:00,875
Our house is like that too...

454
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:03,402
(Really...?)

455
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:05,356
So this is the generation gap.

456
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:06,684
Well, this is my first time...

457
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:08,224
Even cell phones have them!

458
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:09,763
(Old vs. New)

459
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:11,936
Some even uses face recognition!

460
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:14,997
(Changes the topic.)

461
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:16,122
Donkatsu delivery!

462
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:17,545
It has New York in its title.

463
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,049
Don't fart in English.

464
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,934
(Old but creative.)

465
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:24,919
(Used dad jokes to bridge)

466
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,319
(the generation gap.)

467
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:28,223
You guys haven't eaten at home in a while?

468
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:30,329
I really miss home cooking.

469
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:32,684
How long has it been?

470
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:35,122
Thanksgiving from 2 years ago?

471
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:39,596
(Jin's eyes start to wander.)

472
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:40,751
I live close by.

473
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,009
I went 3 days ago.

474
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:45,841
(He doesn't miss it that much.)

475
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,879
It's really close from here.

476
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,907
You have to be honest.

477
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:53,643
(Not all idols miss home cooking.)

478
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:56,583
(Look at this.)

479
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,520
Retina scanner!

480
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,200
This is what you'll do later.

481
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:03,340
(Ring a bell...)

482
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,909
(Approaches quietly.)

483
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:09,257
(He just rang?)

484
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,262
Did you just ring it?

485
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,952
You can't do that yet!

486
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:16,871
I'm not supposed to?

487
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:17,934
Not yet!

488
00:19:18,786 --> 00:19:21,684
Go say sorry if someone answers.

489
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,361
Sorry...

490
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:24,864
Did someone pick up?

491
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,356
No one's home.

492
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:28,903
We didn't start yet!

493
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:31,618
(Well that was a first.)

494
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,333
Think before you act!

495
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,953
I don't care if you're BTS!

496
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,426
(Sad.)

497
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,167
You told me to ring it...

498
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,747
You said, you have to ring it.

499
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:42,766
I said, you will have to ring it.

500
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,208
Try to think first.

501
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,997
You're 5 years older than me!

502
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,840
He's 5 years older than you?

503
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:54,106
Yes.

504
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:55,153
Is he frustrating?

505
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,010
(Needs water to calm down.)

506
00:19:58,075 --> 00:19:59,754
You guys must be good friends.

507
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:00,754
We are.

508
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,122
Do you call him hyung?

509
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,657
I say Jin hyung.

510
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:06,145
He just doesn't use honorific.

511
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:07,153
I do.

512
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:08,369
But I hit him too.

513
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,278
While using honorific?

514
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:12,661
This is a dance for our unreleased song.

515
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:16,103
If we stand like this in a formation...

516
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,323
He slaps me.

517
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:20,575
I was so dumbfounded.

518
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:22,789
Even our choreographer laughed.

519
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,387
That's because it looks so soft.

520
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,504
Back of his neck?

521
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,200
(Jin's neck attracts violence.)

522
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:34,786
We've been slapping each others' necks

523
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:36,825
a lot these days.

524
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:40,190
Doesn't that look like a castle?

525
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Samsung.

526
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,313
(Sung = Castle.)

527
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:45,254
These all are estates, literally.

528
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:47,557
(Houses fenced in with high walls.)

529
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,669
I think it was a same developer.

530
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:51,395
They look identical.

531
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:52,723
You're right.

532
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:56,323
(6 identical houses in one street.)

533
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:57,544
Just like townhouses!

534
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:59,528
They are townhouses.

535
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,134
(Built by Hyundai.)

536
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:04,181
Look over there.

537
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:06,386
That's the Namyang Houses.

538
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:08,668
It looks like a complex.

539
00:21:09,182 --> 00:21:11,389
There are streets inside too.

540
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:13,651
Wouldn't they have managers Yoo?

541
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:15,714
Hi.

542
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,987
What's that space for?

543
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:19,073
What?

544
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,685
A' studio?

545
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,323
What kind of people live around here?

546
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:24,878
Someone really famous.

547
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:25,987
Who?

548
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:27,411
I can't.

549
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:29,244
Can you whisper it to me?

550
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:31,761
Who?

551
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:34,432
It was supposed to be a secret...

552
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:37,041
(Confidentiality.)

553
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:38,808
I wanted to act like I was surprised...

554
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:40,823
Bye!

555
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:43,211
(Samsungdong is a popular areas)

556
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:44,211
(among celebrities.)

557
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,292
Kyung-kyu,

558
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,692
someone we know might

559
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:48,761
open the door.

560
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,118
I know!

561
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:52,214
We might run into our friends.

562
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:53,487
That's why that lady told us

563
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:54,784
to not say anything.

564
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:56,206
But I want to tell someone badly.

565
00:21:56,276 --> 00:21:57,722
We can just cut her out!

566
00:21:57,886 --> 00:21:59,928
Or you could just give us hints.

567
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:01,198
Then try to guess.

568
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:02,706
Lee Min-jung!

569
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,975
(If Lee Min-jung's a hint...)

570
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:07,003
Lee Min-jung!

571
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:09,339
She told me not to reveal

572
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,793
who the other one is!

573
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:13,812
She didn't say don't mention Lee Min-jung.

574
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:15,282
This is Min-jung's house!

575
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:17,776
Do you know who lives here now?

576
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:19,550
What happens if we go there?

577
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:20,995
We know who lives there

578
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:22,464
so you can't ring the doorbell.

579
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:23,862
He's probably out of the country.

580
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:25,065
He's my friend!

581
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,800
(Your honor, I didn't say any names.)

582
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:30,050
I'm starving.

583
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:32,718
We didn't eat properly today.

584
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:34,323
Please...

585
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,230
(Please give us a meal...)

586
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:37,331
Kyung-kyu.

587
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:39,855
Let's choose teams.

588
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:41,948
I want to go with him...

589
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:43,413
But he says so many weird things!

590
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:45,198
It's uncomfortable.

591
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,198
Me?

592
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:47,815
You rang a bell when you shouldn't!

593
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,886
You told me to go ring it.

594
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:51,417
That's why I did!

595
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,042
You two are perfect for each other.

596
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:54,282
They'll be a great team.

597
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,601
They both complain a lot.

598
00:22:57,214 --> 00:22:58,214
With BTS...

599
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:01,746
Let's Have Dinner Together!

600
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,448
The time for BTS to open doors

601
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,585
is finally here.

602
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:10,307
Let's break our limit today.

603
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,979
Let's succeed in two houses.

604
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,995
We're going for 2 houses!

605
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:17,175
Do you think we'll succeed today?

606
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:19,510
(Will they be able to eat today...?)

607
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:22,291
(Who's first?)

608
00:23:22,995 --> 00:23:24,160
Who's going first?

609
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:26,159
Should Jin go first?

610
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,190
Jung-gook should do it!

611
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:29,229
Rock, paper, scissors!

612
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,550
(Jung-gook won!)

613
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,550
I'll go first.

614
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,198
(Not cool...)

615
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:38,248
(Jin's first attempt.)

616
00:23:38,643 --> 00:23:40,714
(His first ring.)

617
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:42,362
(Nervous...)

618
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:44,509
(More nervous...)

619
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:45,917
Show your face!

620
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,870
Yes?

621
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:50,932
Hello.

622
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:53,525
I'm Jin from BTS.

623
00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:55,206
Do you know who we are?

624
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:57,261
Do you know BTS?

625
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,397
Yes.

626
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
You do?

627
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,026
(His eyes are about to pop.)

628
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:03,293
How can I help you?

629
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:04,573
You know BTS?

630
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:05,573
Yes.

631
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:07,979
(He's more surprised that she knows.)

632
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,042
If I man...

633
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,108
How old are you?

634
00:24:12,245 --> 00:24:13,245
I'm old.

635
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:14,425
Why?

636
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:19,307
I'm truly honored that you know who we are.

637
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:20,307
Thank you.

638
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:22,323
Please continue.

639
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:24,964
Did you eat yet?

640
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,102
Our grandma lives here

641
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:29,323
so we eat early.

642
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:30,823
I see...

643
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:33,542
(They ate already!)

644
00:24:33,862 --> 00:24:36,963
(Disappointing.)

645
00:24:38,073 --> 00:24:39,901
She knew who we are!

646
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,011
She knew BTS.

647
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:42,643
She knew BTS...

648
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:44,958
We're taking the world by storm!

649
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:47,903
(Confident after being recognized.)

650
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:50,556
World wide BTS!

651
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:55,475
(Self congratulations is in his DNA.)

652
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,417
Can you express that happiness

653
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,046
by dancing?

654
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:03,229
(Fire.)

655
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:06,026
Jung-gook!

656
00:25:06,432 --> 00:25:07,432
Is it my turn?

657
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:09,653
We go right after one another?

658
00:25:09,745 --> 00:25:12,949
(Jung-gook's first attempt.)

659
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:14,542
Good!

660
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,448
(Readjusts his location.)

661
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:21,432
He has to show his face on the monitor.

662
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,832
He's so good looking!

663
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:24,897
No one's home?

664
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,548
(Tries to use his looks.)

665
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:28,050
I don't think anyone's home.

666
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:29,843
Try one more time.

667
00:25:32,393 --> 00:25:36,010
(Can't use his looks if no one's home...)

668
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:39,533
(No answer yet.)

669
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:42,901
(Jung-gook's first attempt failed.)

670
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:46,425
Let's succeed by the end of this wall.

671
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:48,511
That'd be great.

672
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,964
Jin!

673
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:51,800
(Jin's second attempt!)

674
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,172
Does Jin mean truth?

675
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:54,354
Nope!

676
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:56,932
Aren't you nervous?

677
00:25:56,948 --> 00:25:58,479
I'm really nervous.

678
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,204
(Silly.)

679
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:03,716
I look terrible...

680
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:05,026
Wait.

681
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,146
He needs lights.

682
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:10,432
He's BTS!

683
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:12,886
But still...

684
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:15,104
Who cares about lighting?

685
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:16,136
I'm beautiful!

686
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:18,714
(Stop talking nonsense.)

687
00:26:18,964 --> 00:26:21,965
(A match made in heaven.)

688
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:24,281
(Think before you speak!)

689
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,016
(Rings the bell.)

690
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,629
(Please...)

691
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:35,080
Jin's going toe to toe against Kyung-kyu.

692
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,862
(No answer again...?)

693
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:38,901
Yes?

694
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,307
Hi.

695
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,213
Do you know BTS?

696
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:46,159
No...

697
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:49,676
We're singers...

698
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,393
Did you eat yet?

699
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:52,768
Yes, we all ate.

700
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:53,901
I see...

701
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:56,073
Do you know Let's Have Dinner Together?

702
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,659
Of course!

703
00:26:58,307 --> 00:27:00,284
That's what we're doing right now.

704
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:01,714
Hi.

705
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:02,886
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu!

706
00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:08,411
Why did you eat so early?

707
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:10,409
We're old...

708
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,437
If you didn't...

709
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:15,200
Do you think you would've invite us in?

710
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,339
Of course!

711
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:20,057
(Thank you for the kind gesture.)

712
00:27:20,127 --> 00:27:21,345
Thank you for your time.

713
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:22,651
Thanks.

714
00:27:23,706 --> 00:27:27,334
(It's Jung-gook's turn again.)

715
00:27:28,432 --> 00:27:29,643
(Kyung-kyu rings the bell.)

716
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,690
We'll do it!

717
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:32,175
We need to get ready first!

718
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:35,849
(Nervous.)

719
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:38,831
(Even if you are ready...)

720
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:41,579
(It's no use if no one's home.

721
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,011
We even prayed to Buddha...

722
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:49,079
(Please...)

723
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:51,182
No one's home.

724
00:27:51,956 --> 00:27:52,956
Hello?

725
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:56,698
(Empty house twice in a row.)

726
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,159
(Not only do doors in Samsungdong)

727
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,542
(look incredibly thick...)

728
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,690
It's shut as people went out to eat

729
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,024
on a Sunday evening.

730
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:07,237
The lights are on!

731
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:08,971
(Jin tries to ring...)

732
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:10,159
Do you live here?

733
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:11,909
Hi.

734
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,089
Do you know BTS?

735
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,401
This is BTS.

736
00:28:16,464 --> 00:28:17,464
Hi.

737
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,807
Are you coming back or leaving?

738
00:28:18,807 --> 00:28:19,807
Leaving.

739
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:21,858
Did you eat yet?

740
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:24,448
I'm on a diet.

741
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:28,534
(First person on a diet in this show!)

742
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,139
It would've been nice if we ate together.

743
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:34,285
With this many people?

744
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:37,083
No, only two would've gone in.

745
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:39,612
So you don't normally eat dinner?

746
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:42,042
I do.

747
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,292
Why is the light on inside?

748
00:28:44,596 --> 00:28:46,276
My kids are inside.

749
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:49,511
(Her kids are at home)

750
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:50,956
(and she's going to the gym.)

751
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:53,479
Who else is in there?

752
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:55,261
We could eat with them...

753
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,425
But she won't be home...

754
00:28:58,073 --> 00:28:59,253
Are they young?

755
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:00,714
No.

756
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:02,677
One's in college.

757
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,667
Then can we try?

758
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,133
You can go to the gym.

759
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:09,042
Do you think they ate?

760
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:10,721
They didn't eat yet.

761
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:14,011
Do you want to eat at our yard?

762
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:15,631
Of course!

763
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,120
I don't care if it's a basement.

764
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,511
I could eat on the roof too.

765
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:19,628
We can eat here too!

766
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:20,786
Did you just succeed?

767
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:21,995
Just be quiet for a second.

768
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:23,151
She's on her way out.

769
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:24,770
She said she's not leaving.

770
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:26,917
(Debating about what's going on.)

771
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:27,971
Miss.

772
00:29:28,026 --> 00:29:29,270
I'll have to cook!

773
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:32,200
(Success?)

774
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,711
(Did we do it?)

775
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:38,073
(They're getting their hopes up now!)

776
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,495
Didn't Jung-gook ring a bell?

777
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:43,534
(Damn it.)

778
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,388
His fans are watching!

779
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,374
(Then let me!)

780
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:51,612
How many kids do you have.

781
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:52,667
3.

782
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:57,053
Can I put some makeup on and change?

783
00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:58,386
Of course!

784
00:29:58,448 --> 00:30:01,131
(Take your time.)

785
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:03,096
Then would you like to eat with

786
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:04,401
Kyung-kyu and Jin?

787
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:05,862
Sure!

788
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,920
(Success!)

789
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:14,448
(Totally jealous.)

790
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:17,534
(She goes into her house first.)

791
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,456
Could you ask your kids

792
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:22,722
if they're okay with being filmed?

793
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:24,463
Thank you!

794
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:26,932
We'll get going.

795
00:30:26,932 --> 00:30:28,604
We don't have a lot of time.

796
00:30:28,604 --> 00:30:29,671
Congratulations!

797
00:30:29,737 --> 00:30:30,937
See you next week!

798
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:32,237
We might end up going with you.

799
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:34,281
Congratulations Jin!

800
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:35,815
See you next time.

801
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:37,042
See you tomorrow Jung-gook!

802
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:40,948
(They leave with heavy hearts)

803
00:30:40,948 --> 00:30:42,815
(and heavy steps.)

804
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:44,487
Did they get in?

805
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:48,995
The only thing he sees when he turns,

806
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:50,328
is disappointment...

807
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:53,510
(Waiting outside.)

808
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:55,182
What if her kids don't want to do it?

809
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:57,592
Then we have to go somewhere else.

810
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:00,335
(They need everyone's approval)

811
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:02,301
(to succeed.)

812
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:04,559
She's coming.

813
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,698
Is it okay?

814
00:31:07,706 --> 00:31:10,214
Only my son wanted to do it...

815
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:15,319
(A bolt from the blue.)

816
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:17,300
Then we have to go.

817
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,370
We need everyone's permission.

818
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:21,886
The little ones ran away.

819
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,409
We can't have that.

820
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,947
Thank you.

821
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,604
Thank you for even talking to us.

822
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,011
Thank you.

823
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:29,245
Wish us luck!

824
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:31,237
Good luck!

825
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:33,354
Thank you.

826
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,706
So close, but no cigar.

827
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:39,190
They have to wander in the dark again.

828
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:40,557
Jung-gook!

829
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:43,682
Huh?

830
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
What's wrong?

831
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:48,902
You just said, see you next week.

832
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:51,057
Her son didn't want to?

833
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,542
No.

834
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:54,222
She has 3 kids...

835
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:56,104
Only her son wanted to do it...

836
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,128
(So close.)

837
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:01,354
(I thought it was too easy.)

838
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:03,026
(He's too disappointed to a point)

839
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:04,226
(it became funny.)

840
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,964
The sun is setting.

841
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:07,565
Let's hurry.

842
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:10,773
Most people finish eating by 7.

843
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,870
(Goes down to the camera.)

844
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,901
Are you getting a good vibe?

845
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,229
Stop overreacting.

846
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:28,823
Wake up!

847
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:30,127
That scared me.

848
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,682
(Hilarious.)

849
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:34,362
Hello.

850
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:35,854
I'm BTS.

851
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:37,827
Do you know BTS?

852
00:32:38,534 --> 00:32:41,011
Do you know BTS?

853
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:42,729
No.

854
00:32:43,448 --> 00:32:44,448
Hello?

855
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:46,221
Hi.

856
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,792
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu.

857
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:49,034
Hi.

858
00:32:49,128 --> 00:32:50,194
Did you eat yet?

859
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,702
Did you eat yet?

860
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,607
 I ate a long time ago.

861
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:55,378
You did?

862
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:57,690
We'll close the door for you!

863
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:59,792
Thank you!

864
00:33:02,268 --> 00:33:03,268
Sorry?

865
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:04,661
I'd like to pay for your meal.

866
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:05,661
Money?

867
00:33:05,675 --> 00:33:06,675
It's okay

868
00:33:07,864 --> 00:33:09,309
Thank you for your kind gesture!

869
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:10,973
She wanted to give us money?

870
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:11,973
Wow...

871
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:14,739
Go get the money.

872
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:16,582
Yes, money.

873
00:33:16,832 --> 00:33:18,118
That would've been nice.

874
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:22,864
(She was worried that they'll starve.)

875
00:33:24,215 --> 00:33:25,645
So we can buy food with it?

876
00:33:27,184 --> 00:33:30,018
(Jung-gook's turn.)

877
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:33,504
(Will he be able to talk to someone?)

878
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,059
Hearts!

879
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:36,098
Love!

880
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,661
They're spreading love.

881
00:33:38,512 --> 00:33:39,512
Excuse me!

882
00:33:40,473 --> 00:33:41,473
Hello?

883
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,223
(No one's home again...)

884
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,692
(Let's hurry.)

885
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:48,434
Someone's out!

886
00:33:48,911 --> 00:33:49,911
Who is it?

887
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,950
Ma'am!

888
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:54,194
I'm Kang Ho-dong!

889
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:56,386
We're doing a show when

890
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:58,493
we can talk all sorts of things

891
00:33:58,551 --> 00:33:59,551
in Samsungdong!

892
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:00,965
Let's Have Dinner Together?

893
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:01,965
(She knows!)

894
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
I'm starving!

895
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:04,463
For our guest today,

896
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:06,942
I brought...

897
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,340
Do you know BTS?

898
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:12,104
I'm too old to know what it is.

899
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:14,505
I ate already!

900
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:16,254
You did?

901
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:17,938
(Failed...)

902
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,734
Why did you eat so early?

903
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,082
We always eat early.

904
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:22,082
How early?

905
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:23,106
4:30.

906
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:25,674
That's lunch!

907
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:27,079
You didn't eat dinner yet.

908
00:34:27,176 --> 00:34:28,575
Our breakfast is at 5.

909
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:29,903
Breakfast is at 5?

910
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:32,137
Then when do you eat lunch?

911
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:33,653
12.

912
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:35,582
Just like in a military.

913
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:36,749
Aren't?

914
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:38,856
Old people don't get hungry.

915
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:41,775
Do you think we'll succeed today?

916
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:44,223
Everyone probably ate by now.

917
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:47,250
Only old people live around here.

918
00:34:47,762 --> 00:34:50,620
(Most people eat early here...)

919
00:34:50,684 --> 00:34:51,901
Then we'll have to get going.

920
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:54,126
Sorry we have to go!

921
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:55,473
Wish us luck.

922
00:34:56,317 --> 00:34:59,110
(They're picking up speed.)

923
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:01,848
We even brought our own spoons!

924
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:04,096
We ate already.

925
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,481
You did?

926
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:07,895
We ate already.

927
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,145
Did you eat yet?

928
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:12,348
Yup!

929
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:15,469
We eat late.

930
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,048
But people here eat really early.

931
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:20,567
Dinner's early in Samsungdong...

932
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:22,192
As they hurry more,

933
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,786
the walls grow taller.

934
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,848
This isn't as easy as I thought it'd be.

935
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:30,497
(Ho-dong and Jung-gook's attempt!)

936
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,593
One team has to succeed at least.

937
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:36,281
(Desperate hands.)

938
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:38,497
We should change the rules.

939
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:41,817
(A trick in order to succeed.)

940
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:44,576
Let's allow houses that already ate.

941
00:35:44,887 --> 00:35:46,684
There are 3 houses here.

942
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:47,684
Who is it?

943
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:51,060
Do you know BTS?

944
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,060
Yes.

945
00:35:53,825 --> 00:35:55,325
Hi!

946
00:35:55,832 --> 00:35:57,912
I'm Kang Ho-dong!

947
00:35:58,176 --> 00:36:00,161
Ho-dong!

948
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:01,223
Yes?

949
00:36:01,848 --> 00:36:02,848
Me?

950
00:36:02,926 --> 00:36:03,926
Kang Ho-dong!

951
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:05,965
Do you know me?

952
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:07,395
Of course I do!

953
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,013
(Who could it be?)

954
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:12,036
I'm...

955
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:16,883
Who is she?

956
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:18,911
Do you know me?

957
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:20,434
Of course I do!

958
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,983
(Who could it be...)

959
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:26,199
Ho-dong, I'm Kim Nam-ju.

960
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,691
(They rang Kim Nam-ju's house!)

961
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:31,739
Kim Nam-ju!

962
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:34,567
We didn't know you lived here!

963
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:35,778
We really didn't.

964
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:36,895
We're shooting

965
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:38,153
Let's Have Dinner Together!

966
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:41,899
I saw a bunch of lights pass by

967
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:45,460
and was wondering what it was.

968
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,426
I was so surprised when my doorbell rung.

969
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:50,754
Did you eat already?

970
00:36:51,223 --> 00:36:52,745
I already ate with my kid.

971
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:56,809
Did you ever watch our show before?

972
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:58,239
Of course!

973
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:01,228
Why did you have to come today...

974
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:04,090
I seriously would love to offer

975
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,622
you guys a meal.

976
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:07,725
That sucks.

977
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:09,770
Who's home right now?

978
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:13,438
Just me and my 2 kids.

979
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:15,309
Do they like BTS?

980
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:16,930
My daughter loves them.

981
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:18,692
Jin, say hell.

982
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:22,143
(Identifies himself.)

983
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,567
Hi Kim Nam-ju!

984
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:26,598
Hi!

985
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,473
Where did Sung-woo go?

986
00:37:29,098 --> 00:37:31,973
Seung-woo stepped out for a bit.

987
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:35,145
He's not home right now.

988
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:36,895
That's fine!

989
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:39,653
Please tell him we said hi!

990
00:37:39,653 --> 00:37:40,653
Sorry!

991
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:43,320
Come to our show next time!

992
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:45,872
If you pass our house again,

993
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:47,981
you can definitely come in.

994
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,629
We literally just ate.

995
00:37:50,629 --> 00:37:51,629
I'm so sorry.

996
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,105
This is such a weird coincidence!

997
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:58,254
Jung-gook wants to say bye

998
00:37:58,254 --> 00:37:59,598
to your daughter!

999
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:01,114
Hi.

1000
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,145
Hi!

1001
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,328
See you next time!

1002
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:08,996
Bye!

1003
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,739
We'll get going then!

1004
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:11,913
Sorry!

1005
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:13,602
Thank you!

1006
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:18,933
(They almost ate at Nam-ju's!)

1007
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:21,254
I'm sorry but...

1008
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,239
We're going to Lee Min-jung's house.

1009
00:38:25,926 --> 00:38:29,755
(Still can't believe what just happened...)

1010
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,012
I'm starving.

1011
00:38:36,286 --> 00:38:38,187
We'll try first.

1012
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:43,317
Yes?

1013
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:44,411
Hi!

1014
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,270
Ma'am!

1015
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:47,809
Hi!

1016
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:49,801
This is BTS.

1017
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:56,318
She's coming out.

1018
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,893
(Can they find someone who didn't eat yet?)

1019
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:01,989
Hi!

1020
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:03,606
Is this Let's Have Dinner Together?

1021
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:04,606
Yes!

1022
00:39:04,747 --> 00:39:05,963
Did you eat yet?

1023
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,051
Yes.

1024
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:09,668
It would've been nice to eat together.

1025
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:10,849
I'm Kang Ho-dong.

1026
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:12,106
(Let's go.)

1027
00:39:13,098 --> 00:39:14,239
I'm sorry.

1028
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:17,418
I'm sorry that you can't even come in...

1029
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:18,981
That's okay.

1030
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,624
Good luck in the future!

1031
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:21,653
Thank you!

1032
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:23,707
Thanks for welcoming us.

1033
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:29,442
Hi.

1034
00:39:29,926 --> 00:39:33,593
We're from JTBC.

1035
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:35,260
Let's Have Dinner Together!

1036
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,332
Yes!

1037
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:37,778
I watch it every day!

1038
00:39:37,848 --> 00:39:39,106
We're on air on Wednesday.

1039
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:40,454
Where do you live?

1040
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:42,348
Way over there.

1041
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,668
Did you eat yet?

1042
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,762
Of course I ate.

1043
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,363
(Shows her disappointment.)

1044
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,215
It would've been nice to talk to you

1045
00:39:51,215 --> 00:39:52,682
while eating together.

1046
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,627
I already ate.

1047
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,614
(Should've come sooner...)

1048
00:39:57,754 --> 00:39:59,345
That house has lights on!

1049
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:01,676
Lights are on!

1050
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:05,938
(Jin takes the lead.)

1051
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:12,856
Who is it?

1052
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:14,676
Hi!

1053
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:18,262
Do you know BTS?

1054
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:19,965
I don't.

1055
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:22,480
We're an idol.

1056
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:24,067
We're shooting a show called,

1057
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,867
Let's Have Dinner Together.

1058
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:27,973
(The most important question!)

1059
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:29,110
Did you eat yet?

1060
00:40:29,465 --> 00:40:31,106
I'm eating right now.

1061
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,450
Hello?

1062
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:34,317
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu!

1063
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:38,332
We bring our own spoons...

1064
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,480
If you let us in,

1065
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,981
this is a show about eating together

1066
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:43,364
while having a conversation.

1067
00:40:43,394 --> 00:40:45,535
Did you watch Let's Have Dinner Together?

1068
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:46,566
No.

1069
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,074
I see...

1070
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:49,917
Who are you eating with?

1071
00:40:50,464 --> 00:40:51,620
By myself.

1072
00:40:51,894 --> 00:40:53,902
Then how about...

1073
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:57,417
Eating with me and BTS?

1074
00:40:58,027 --> 00:41:01,081
Would you like to eat with us?

1075
00:41:01,214 --> 00:41:02,717
I don't think I can...

1076
00:41:02,777 --> 00:41:04,792
I see.

1077
00:41:05,003 --> 00:41:06,667
Thank you!

1078
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,730
Thank you!

1079
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:09,574
Thank you!

1080
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:13,224
This is hard...

1081
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:14,441
She's alone right now.

1082
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:16,417
We only have 30 more minutes.

1083
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:17,511
We have to run.

1084
00:41:19,722 --> 00:41:21,480
We're done eating.

1085
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:27,363
(They all ate already...)

1086
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:29,558
The clock keeps ticking.

1087
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:32,592
Now it's time for Blood, Sweat and Tears.

1088
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:35,480
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1089
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:38,028
I can smell the convenience store.

1090
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:39,433
Jin.

1091
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:41,500
We only have 20 more minutes.

1092
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:44,079
As long as I'm with you, I don't care.

1093
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:46,554
I don't think you understood my question.

1094
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:52,051
(He doesn't care what the question is.)

1095
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,870
We're running out of time!

1096
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,386
(With no teams succeeding yet,)

1097
00:41:55,386 --> 00:41:56,887
(they have to start running.)

1098
00:41:57,909 --> 00:41:58,910
7:42.

1099
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,718
(Hopeless...)

1100
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:04,785
Car! Car! Car!

1101
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:05,980
There's a car!

1102
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:09,436
(No more hesitations.)

1103
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:11,511
Kyung-kyu.

1104
00:42:15,238 --> 00:42:16,816
That sounds like a song.

1105
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,339
Why does it sound like that?

1106
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:24,700
(Even bells are giving the trouble now...)

1107
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,308
There's no time to have fun with it!

1108
00:42:27,894 --> 00:42:28,894
I'm starving.

1109
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:31,878
Let's go to the apartments!

1110
00:42:33,214 --> 00:42:34,464
We only have 15 more minutes.

1111
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:36,808
They hopelessly walk into apartments

1112
00:42:36,808 --> 00:42:38,644
with one foot in the convenience store

1113
00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:39,644
already.

1114
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:43,912
Okay, here we go.

1115
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:46,995
(Please...)

1116
00:42:47,995 --> 00:42:48,995
Who is it?

1117
00:42:49,597 --> 00:42:50,597
Hello?

1118
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:52,542
I'm...

1119
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,251
(He's stuttering.)

1120
00:42:54,464 --> 00:42:55,686
I'm Kang Ho-dong.

1121
00:42:56,136 --> 00:42:58,042
We're done eating.

1122
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:00,039
You already ate?

1123
00:43:00,464 --> 00:43:01,464
Yes...

1124
00:43:02,097 --> 00:43:03,230
Our deadline's at 8.

1125
00:43:03,277 --> 00:43:05,160
We'll get going.

1126
00:43:06,558 --> 00:43:09,225
(Turns on his boosters.)

1127
00:43:10,527 --> 00:43:12,606
We'll go next door!

1128
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:16,660
10 minutes to go.

1129
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:18,777
Everyone for themselves.

1130
00:43:20,722 --> 00:43:22,339
(They split up into 2 teams)

1131
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:23,964
(for a better chance!)

1132
00:43:24,027 --> 00:43:25,027
Who is it?

1133
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:26,167
Hi.

1134
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:30,308
Do you know Let's Have Dinner Together?

1135
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,574
I'm sorry...

1136
00:43:33,425 --> 00:43:35,347
It's okay!

1137
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:36,714
It's fine!

1138
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:37,714
Thanks!

1139
00:43:38,253 --> 00:43:39,745
We only have 7 minutes!

1140
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:42,152
7 is a lucky number!

1141
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,152
Exactly!

1142
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,253
I'm sorry...

1143
00:43:44,285 --> 00:43:45,285
We just ate!

1144
00:43:45,816 --> 00:43:48,547
(Unlucky 7.)

1145
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,230
Come back to our show later...

1146
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:52,636
For a revenge.

1147
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:54,824
We don't have any time left!

1148
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:56,222
We only have 4 minutes.

1149
00:43:56,253 --> 00:43:58,423
But we already ate...

1150
00:43:58,753 --> 00:43:59,753
You did?

1151
00:44:01,331 --> 00:44:02,917
2 minutes!

1152
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:05,355
Should we go to Bongeun Temple

1153
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
for temple food?

1154
00:44:08,363 --> 00:44:10,495
These doors are bullet proof.

1155
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:13,301
Will they both fail for the first time?

1156
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:15,214
1 minute.

1157
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,550
This is our last chance.

1158
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:19,550
(Failure here means they're going)

1159
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:20,811
(to the convenience store!)

1160
00:44:21,331 --> 00:44:24,037
(Ring the bell together!)

1161
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,191
(They only have 1 more minute too.)

1162
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:28,464
Hi!

1163
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:32,092
(Their last hope.)

1164
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:34,233
Do you know BTS?

1165
00:44:34,245 --> 00:44:34,862
Yes!

1166
00:44:34,886 --> 00:44:35,886
Really?

1167
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:37,407
Nice to meet you!

1168
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:40,292
Did you eat yet?

1169
00:44:40,355 --> 00:44:41,355
No!

1170
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:42,402
You didn't eat yet?

1171
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,246
Are you about to?

1172
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:46,507
We're getting ready for dinner!

1173
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:47,676
Where's your mom?

1174
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,080
Dad's home!

1175
00:44:49,558 --> 00:44:51,105
You can come up!

1176
00:44:51,324 --> 00:44:52,590
Ask your dad first!

1177
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:55,699
Dad!

1178
00:44:55,738 --> 00:44:56,738
Please...

1179
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,410
Hi!

1180
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:01,964
Who is it?

1181
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,328
This is BTS.

1182
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:07,300
What?

1183
00:45:07,324 --> 00:45:10,684
And I'm Kang Ho-dong!

1184
00:45:11,535 --> 00:45:12,964
Kang Ho-dong is here!

1185
00:45:13,636 --> 00:45:15,096
BTS!

1186
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:17,089
Hi!

1187
00:45:18,128 --> 00:45:20,222
Let me explain what we're doing.

1188
00:45:20,222 --> 00:45:21,222
Please...

1189
00:45:23,105 --> 00:45:25,058
Do you want me to explain what we're doing?

1190
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:27,703
You're wearing rubber gloves...

1191
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:32,232
You're even holding a spoon!

1192
00:45:32,324 --> 00:45:33,699
You didn't eat dinner yet?

1193
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:35,091
No idea.

1194
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:38,734
(What does her rubber gloves mean?)

1195
00:45:39,026 --> 00:45:40,574
(Doing the dishes after a meal?)

1196
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:42,546
(Or before a meal?)

1197
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:46,051
We don't care what you have...

1198
00:45:46,355 --> 00:45:48,214
This is our last house.

1199
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:49,839
We're out choices now.

1200
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,028
This is our last chance.

1201
00:45:52,855 --> 00:45:54,191
Don't get nervous.

1202
00:45:54,191 --> 00:45:55,568
Let's shake hands.

1203
00:45:57,152 --> 00:45:58,972
Can I ask you an important question?

1204
00:45:59,988 --> 00:46:00,988
Please...

1205
00:46:01,245 --> 00:46:02,760
You should ask.

1206
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:05,208
Did you eat dinner yet?

1207
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,167
Can we come up?

1208
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,438
The time has run out.

1209
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:11,636
Can they make one last miracle

1210
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:14,078
and have a meal in Samsungdong?

1211
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:18,078
He said you can!

1212
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:19,152
We can?

1213
00:46:19,558 --> 00:46:22,317
(It's a miracle!)

1214
00:46:22,394 --> 00:46:24,167
(Ecstatic.)

1215
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,652
I can't believe we ran into them!

1216
00:46:27,003 --> 00:46:29,309
(Will miracle happen here too?)

1217
00:46:29,355 --> 00:46:30,422
Did you eat yet?

1218
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:35,980
We're cleaning up right now...

1219
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,522
(No way...)

1220
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:41,146
(No...)

1221
00:46:41,238 --> 00:46:44,054
(Ho-dong and Jung-gook failed.)

1222
00:46:44,878 --> 00:46:46,393
We love BTS.

1223
00:46:46,425 --> 00:46:48,330
My son does too.

1224
00:46:48,402 --> 00:46:49,826
I'm sorry...

1225
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:52,932
Can the camera get your hand?

1226
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:55,183
Were you doing the dishes?

1227
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,863
I just started doing the dishes.

1228
00:46:58,027 --> 00:46:59,628
It would've been nice if she was

1229
00:46:59,628 --> 00:47:00,730
getting ready for dinner.

1230
00:47:00,808 --> 00:47:02,075
We just finished...

1231
00:47:02,324 --> 00:47:03,324
You'd be still eating

1232
00:47:03,394 --> 00:47:04,660
if we came 5 minutes early?

1233
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,917
3 minutes.

1234
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,160
3 minutes?

1235
00:47:07,347 --> 00:47:08,644
(Disappointed...)

1236
00:47:08,808 --> 00:47:10,480
Would you have eaten with us

1237
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,542
if we came 3 minutes early?

1238
00:47:13,714 --> 00:47:14,714
Of course!

1239
00:47:14,956 --> 00:47:17,722
Because it's Sunday...

1240
00:47:17,722 --> 00:47:19,441
We had Korean BBQ.

1241
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:23,464
How was it?

1242
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:24,527
Good.

1243
00:47:25,128 --> 00:47:27,128
(Sad...)

1244
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,776
And we just went to a bakery...

1245
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:31,422
And bought cake.

1246
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:33,199
Cake as well?

1247
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:35,198
Then had a glass of wine.

1248
00:47:36,894 --> 00:47:38,761
(What was the point of our whole day...)

1249
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:40,571
(This place was heaven...)

1250
00:47:42,105 --> 00:47:43,105
This meal...

1251
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:44,652
Is a perfect course meal

1252
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:48,074
with LA style galbi, cake and wine.

1253
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,800
It could've been theirs

1254
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,394
if they came 3 minutes earlier.

1255
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:55,730
Do you know who this is?

1256
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:57,542
Probably not...

1257
00:47:57,745 --> 00:47:59,019
I know BTS...

1258
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,212
(She knows!)

1259
00:48:02,597 --> 00:48:04,076
Thank you.

1260
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:05,928
She says BTS not Bangtan.

1261
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,713
They're popular in Japan.

1262
00:48:07,808 --> 00:48:09,308
How did you know that?

1263
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:12,152
I go there often for business trips.

1264
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,636
Didn't you have a concert in Osaka?

1265
00:48:14,777 --> 00:48:15,777
That's right!

1266
00:48:15,863 --> 00:48:17,558
I saw a bunch of people in a line

1267
00:48:17,683 --> 00:48:18,750
so when I asked,

1268
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,505
they said, we're waiting for BTS!

1269
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,962
(Embarrassed.)

1270
00:48:24,074 --> 00:48:26,340
Only if we came 3 minutes early...

1271
00:48:26,729 --> 00:48:28,144
we could've talked about this

1272
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:29,144
while sitting down.

1273
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,261
I love one of their songs,

1274
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,017
Blood, Sweat and Tears.

1275
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,872
I love it.

1276
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:40,081
(I could've sang it inside...)

1277
00:48:40,152 --> 00:48:41,761
When I listen to that song...

1278
00:48:46,597 --> 00:48:47,971
Spring Day and Not Today.

1279
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:58,109
(Singing in a hall because of 3 minutes.)

1280
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:00,542
(Touched.)

1281
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:04,260
(I want to eat...)

1282
00:49:05,636 --> 00:49:08,461
(The crowd is going nuts!)

1283
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:10,316
Thank you.

1284
00:49:11,003 --> 00:49:13,538
I want LA style galbi.

1285
00:49:14,527 --> 00:49:16,861
I'm so disappointed!

1286
00:49:17,308 --> 00:49:18,308
Attention!

1287
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:19,870
Say thank you.

1288
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:21,256
Thank you!

1289
00:49:22,777 --> 00:49:25,925
They missed a meal by 3 minutes...

1290
00:49:26,268 --> 00:49:28,736
Now they head to the convenience store.

1291
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:31,449
So close...

1292
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:34,636
That could've been a dramatic finish.

1293
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:36,409
It really was close.

1294
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,597
What happened to the other team?

1295
00:49:43,285 --> 00:49:47,739
(Arrived at the front door!)

1296
00:49:49,363 --> 00:49:50,363
Hi!

1297
00:49:50,386 --> 00:49:51,386
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu.

1298
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:53,511
Thank you for inviting us in!

1299
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:54,558
Invite...

1300
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,167
My kids did!

1301
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,497
You didn't yet yet?

1302
00:49:57,605 --> 00:49:58,605
I didn't...

1303
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,796
But my wife isn't home.

1304
00:50:00,878 --> 00:50:02,761
We can eat whatever's lying around.

1305
00:50:02,777 --> 00:50:03,839
I'm a good cook!

1306
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:04,917
He is!

1307
00:50:05,152 --> 00:50:06,518
Then come inside!

1308
00:50:06,566 --> 00:50:07,566
Thank you!

1309
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:10,050
Thanks to the little girls by the window,

1310
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:11,894
they finally got the door opened

1311
00:50:12,003 --> 00:50:14,070
and went inside to have a meal.

1312
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,245
Hi!

1313
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,986
I love Let's Have Dinner Together!

1314
00:50:18,339 --> 00:50:19,708
BTS!

1315
00:50:21,035 --> 00:50:22,852
BTS!

1316
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:25,191
Who's that?

1317
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:26,536
My oldest daughter.

1318
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:28,459
(Shy.)

1319
00:50:28,574 --> 00:50:29,972
How many daughters do you have?

1320
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:31,011
Jenny!

1321
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:32,706
That's a pretty name.

1322
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,324
Who's Jenny?

1323
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:36,012
She's too shy. She can't come out.

1324
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:37,810
She's a huge fan.

1325
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:38,870
A fan!

1326
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,288
We all are!

1327
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:41,339
Jenny!

1328
00:50:41,402 --> 00:50:42,589
Come here.

1329
00:50:42,636 --> 00:50:44,011
Introduce yourselves.

1330
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,449
What grade are you in?

1331
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:48,175
We're all in 6th grade!

1332
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:50,089
Elementary school?

1333
00:50:50,722 --> 00:50:52,027
You're all friends?

1334
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,574
Except her.

1335
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:54,605
What grade are you in?

1336
00:50:54,675 --> 00:50:55,675
2.

1337
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,617
Who's your daughter?

1338
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,980
Jenny.

1339
00:51:00,011 --> 00:51:01,667
The little one here, and the oldest one.

1340
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:03,277
What's your name?

1341
00:51:03,308 --> 00:51:04,308
Min-ji.

1342
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,964
Min-ji and Jenny.

1343
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,949
Min-ji and Jenny love BTS.

1344
00:51:09,089 --> 00:51:10,995
A dinner with their friends.

1345
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,090
(Can't believe BTS is here!)

1346
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,113
Calm down.

1347
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:18,745
First time seeing him?

1348
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:19,745
Yes.

1349
00:51:20,183 --> 00:51:21,230
Isn't he handsome?

1350
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,480
Very!

1351
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:25,269
Why are you eating so late?

1352
00:51:25,402 --> 00:51:27,818
We're having a pajama party today...

1353
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:28,917
What party?

1354
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:29,964
Pajama party.

1355
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:31,636
You walk around in pajamas?

1356
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:34,825
It's kind of a sleep over.

1357
00:51:35,214 --> 00:51:36,777
That's called a pajama party?

1358
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,910
But for an old man, Kyung-kyu,

1359
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:40,636
there's something more important

1360
00:51:40,636 --> 00:51:42,667
than a pajama party.

1361
00:51:42,761 --> 00:51:44,206
What are you making?

1362
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:46,870
I'm making rice for now.

1363
00:51:47,347 --> 00:51:48,347
Kimchi stew!

1364
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:50,042
(Love it!)

1365
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:52,777
Do kids come here often...

1366
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,527
To stay over?

1367
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,452
Yes, all the time!

1368
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:59,120
I've never heard of a pajama party before.

1369
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:01,292
They wear pajamas and just play

1370
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:02,292
in a room.

1371
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:04,987
Do you have to take care of them?

1372
00:52:05,558 --> 00:52:08,147
My wife does normally.

1373
00:52:08,214 --> 00:52:09,785
But she's traveling right now.

1374
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,855
Travel?

1375
00:52:12,347 --> 00:52:14,830
You're a good husband.

1376
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,593
If I may, what do you do for a living?

1377
00:52:17,816 --> 00:52:19,261
I'm in an education business.

1378
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,653
Education business?

1379
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:21,800
You own an academy?

1380
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
Yes.

1381
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,137
Kids in that age...

1382
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,912
Love BTS.

1383
00:52:26,964 --> 00:52:27,964
I know...

1384
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,660
If you said no, you would've been

1385
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,660
in trouble.

1386
00:52:35,058 --> 00:52:36,058
Hi...

1387
00:52:37,214 --> 00:52:39,339
You're my wallpaper...

1388
00:52:39,339 --> 00:52:40,677
Can I see it?

1389
00:52:42,214 --> 00:52:44,738
(Shaking.)

1390
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,030
(Fact checked.)

1391
00:52:47,324 --> 00:52:48,831
That's embarrassing.

1392
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,980
Thank you.

1393
00:52:50,011 --> 00:52:51,917
Min-ji!

1394
00:52:52,933 --> 00:52:54,089
Did you call your friend?

1395
00:52:54,136 --> 00:52:56,292
She was supposed to come over...

1396
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:57,925
We don't have enough rice.

1397
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,144
Tell her to go home.

1398
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,183
(You're too mean...)

1399
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,237
I'm her phone's wallpaper!

1400
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:05,589
Really?

1401
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:08,646
She had my face on her phone!

1402
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:09,870
It's true!

1403
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,438
(Proud.)

1404
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:17,113
She has Jin as her wallpaper!

1405
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:18,761
Guys.

1406
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:20,855
You guys need to thank me.

1407
00:53:20,933 --> 00:53:22,184
I brought him here.

1408
00:53:23,152 --> 00:53:24,527
Thank you.

1409
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:26,157
Didn't I say hi first?

1410
00:53:26,902 --> 00:53:28,714
(Embarrassed.)

1411
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:29,917
Change your wallpaper

1412
00:53:30,089 --> 00:53:31,089
to me later.

1413
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:33,750
(No thank you...)

1414
00:53:33,761 --> 00:53:35,225
I'll even take a picture with you.

1415
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,253
Thank you...

1416
00:53:39,753 --> 00:53:43,493
(A fart broke the ice in the room...)

1417
00:53:45,136 --> 00:53:47,075
He has healthy intestines!

1418
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:49,066
He knows how TVs work!

1419
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:51,792
For the first time in our show...

1420
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:53,722
Someone farted.

1421
00:53:54,456 --> 00:53:55,923
Do you know how to say

1422
00:53:56,081 --> 00:53:57,863
farting in English?

1423
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:00,074
Thar's not right!

1424
00:54:00,144 --> 00:54:02,077
What's don't fart in English?

1425
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,620
How do you say don't fart in English?

1426
00:54:05,152 --> 00:54:06,152
I have no idea.

1427
00:54:10,644 --> 00:54:12,980
He told me that earlier today.

1428
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,143
Then he really farted!

1429
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:16,949
(Perfect timing!)

1430
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:18,558
That was the first time.

1431
00:54:18,636 --> 00:54:19,769
Who's his sister?

1432
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,800
I am.

1433
00:54:20,886 --> 00:54:22,527
Did he follow you to the pajama party?

1434
00:54:22,558 --> 00:54:24,092
No, he'll go home soon.

1435
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,216
(That's cold...)

1436
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:29,183
Why don't you guys introduce yourselves?

1437
00:54:29,691 --> 00:54:31,058
I'm in grade 6, class 3 in

1438
00:54:31,058 --> 00:54:32,325
Bongeun Elementary.

1439
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:33,378
Kim Jenny.

1440
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,338
I'm in grade 6, class 1.

1441
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:37,619
Kim Ho-jung.

1442
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:40,105
Are you a good student?

1443
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,685
I'm not...

1444
00:54:43,988 --> 00:54:45,238
What do you wanna be later?

1445
00:54:45,464 --> 00:54:46,830
 Korean classical music.

1446
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:47,964
Really?

1447
00:54:48,128 --> 00:54:49,449
I want to listen to it later!

1448
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,441
She can play a pipe!

1449
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,444
She wants to do it too.

1450
00:54:54,495 --> 00:54:56,615
(It was Jenny's dream too!)

1451
00:54:57,362 --> 00:54:58,328
Next!

1452
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,328
Fart!

1453
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:01,846
(His turn to introduce himself.)

1454
00:55:02,742 --> 00:55:04,789
I'm in grade 2, class 4.

1455
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:06,140
Kim Ho-jun.

1456
00:55:06,203 --> 00:55:07,203
Kim Ho-jun!

1457
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:08,664
Grade 6, class 5.

1458
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,750
Jo Su-min.

1459
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:10,820
Jo Su-min.

1460
00:55:11,171 --> 00:55:12,882
What do you wanna be when you grow up?

1461
00:55:13,296 --> 00:55:15,588
I haven't thought about that yet...

1462
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,343
You didn't?

1463
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,562
You're only in 6th grade.

1464
00:55:19,656 --> 00:55:20,804
I'm in grade 6, class 4.

1465
00:55:20,804 --> 00:55:22,265
Lee Ji-Ahn.

1466
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:24,751
What do you wanna be?

1467
00:55:24,828 --> 00:55:25,828
A perfumer.

1468
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:28,117
(She wants to make perfumes.)

1469
00:55:28,445 --> 00:55:30,414
You want to make your own perfume?

1470
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:33,781
I'm in Gyeonggi Women's High School,

1471
00:55:33,828 --> 00:55:35,479
9th grade, Ko Ye-rang.

1472
00:55:36,492 --> 00:55:38,453
9th grade, I'm Kim Min-ju.

1473
00:55:39,304 --> 00:55:40,304
I...

1474
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:42,148
Want to do my own business!

1475
00:55:43,234 --> 00:55:44,976
(Cracks up.)

1476
00:55:44,976 --> 00:55:45,976
Fashion?

1477
00:55:46,554 --> 00:55:47,554
Nice.

1478
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:49,437
(While they're having fun inside...)

1479
00:55:49,492 --> 00:55:52,259
(They're distraught by disappointment.)

1480
00:55:52,259 --> 00:55:53,607
It's not over yet.

1481
00:55:54,132 --> 00:55:55,617
Look for a convenience store?

1482
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,344
I'm disappointed.

1483
00:55:58,585 --> 00:55:59,968
Talk about this...

1484
00:55:59,968 --> 00:56:00,968
And that!

1485
00:56:01,148 --> 00:56:03,020
That's what we should be doing...

1486
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,664
But the last family really did welcome us.

1487
00:56:09,835 --> 00:56:11,242
I guess that counts too.

1488
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:12,335
I guess so.

1489
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:13,359
We got love instead!

1490
00:56:13,593 --> 00:56:14,976
The love and warm heart...

1491
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,210
Were enough to fill me up today.

1492
00:56:18,749 --> 00:56:21,198
But I can't get galbi out of my mind...

1493
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:24,638
(Where is he going?)

1494
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:27,851
(He lost his mind due to hunger.)

1495
00:56:28,054 --> 00:56:29,328
Put some garlic in it.

1496
00:56:30,648 --> 00:56:33,783
(This is how scary hunger is.)

1497
00:56:34,062 --> 00:56:36,017
That looks delicious.

1498
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,070
wonderful!

1499
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:42,453
(After a tough acting...)

1500
00:56:42,523 --> 00:56:43,718
(Comes a deep sigh.)

1501
00:56:43,718 --> 00:56:45,252
Let's sit for 1 minute.

1502
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,804
We walked so much today.

1503
00:56:48,429 --> 00:56:50,411
(Exhausted.)

1504
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,093
I'm starving.

1505
00:56:54,023 --> 00:56:56,490
Both teams failed for the first time?

1506
00:56:56,929 --> 00:57:00,383
(They don't know about Kyung-kyu yet.)

1507
00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:02,192
Should we call them?

1508
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:04,289
What?

1509
00:57:05,085 --> 00:57:06,765
Ho-dong called me.

1510
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:07,867
Wait.

1511
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:10,779
 (Found Jung-gook.)

1512
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:13,260
(2nd chaos.)

1513
00:57:13,281 --> 00:57:15,945
(They can only see Kyung-kyu.)

1514
00:57:15,945 --> 00:57:18,421
(Unaware of their success.)

1515
00:57:22,578 --> 00:57:25,363
(What?)

1516
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:27,242
They got in!

1517
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:29,330
Why aren't you inside?

1518
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,296
Is this real?

1519
00:57:32,835 --> 00:57:34,242
(Totally real.)

1520
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,242
Hi!

1521
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:38,101
Hi!

1522
00:57:39,304 --> 00:57:40,617
You guys succeeded?

1523
00:57:40,882 --> 00:57:42,250
At 8!

1524
00:57:42,578 --> 00:57:44,039
Did you eat yet?

1525
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,882
It's being cooked!

1526
00:57:47,117 --> 00:57:48,781
He's cooking by himself.

1527
00:57:49,437 --> 00:57:52,704
That's unbelievable.

1528
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:54,226
Go to the convenience store

1529
00:57:54,382 --> 00:57:56,409
and call me back when you eat ramen!

1530
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:01,226
Jin, since you're the only one to succeed,

1531
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:03,801
good luck on promoting your song!

1532
00:58:04,733 --> 00:58:06,820
Good luck Jin!

1533
00:58:07,523 --> 00:58:08,921
Our episode in Samsungdong...

1534
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:11,740
Only a half successful!

1535
00:58:14,132 --> 00:58:15,814
Enjoy your meal!

1536
00:58:17,976 --> 00:58:20,279
(Good luck Jung-gook!)

1537
00:58:20,429 --> 00:58:21,960
They succeeded...

1538
00:58:23,445 --> 00:58:25,148
We don't have all the time in the world

1539
00:58:25,148 --> 00:58:26,304
for convenience stores.

1540
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:28,063
Our deadline's at 9:30.

1541
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:30,250
We have an hour left.

1542
00:58:30,617 --> 00:58:31,617
Let's go.

1543
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:32,773
Let's go find one.

1544
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:39,176
(Can they find people to eat with?)

1545
00:58:40,671 --> 00:58:42,164
I don't know where we are.

1546
00:58:42,343 --> 00:58:44,148
I don't think there are any here.

1547
00:58:44,757 --> 00:58:46,320
Over there!

1548
00:58:46,976 --> 00:58:48,506
Let's watch from over here.

1549
00:58:48,781 --> 00:58:49,781
This way.

1550
00:58:49,945 --> 00:58:53,101
(Tries to scout from across the street.)

1551
00:58:53,265 --> 00:58:54,265
3 men?

1552
00:58:54,695 --> 00:58:56,382
(Having a conversation.)

1553
00:58:56,437 --> 00:58:57,437
Should we go?

1554
00:58:58,257 --> 00:59:00,972
(Ho-dong approaches them first.)

1555
00:59:01,578 --> 00:59:02,578
Hi.

1556
00:59:03,726 --> 00:59:05,304
Are you eating?

1557
00:59:05,695 --> 00:59:06,946
We're about to go eat.

1558
00:59:07,054 --> 00:59:08,445
You're going right now?

1559
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:10,164
Isn't it too late?

1560
00:59:10,523 --> 00:59:11,912
We just got out of work.

1561
00:59:11,912 --> 00:59:13,206
Now?

1562
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:14,984
Are you guys coworkers?

1563
00:59:16,179 --> 00:59:17,710
Okay, have fun!

1564
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,632
(Searching for convenience stores.)

1565
00:59:21,132 --> 00:59:23,741
(Found another one.)

1566
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:26,630
(Anyone eating...?)

1567
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:28,992
(No one.)

1568
00:59:28,992 --> 00:59:29,992
Let's just wait.

1569
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,835
Someone will come, right?

1570
00:59:33,093 --> 00:59:35,320
We have until 9:30...

1571
00:59:35,562 --> 00:59:37,039
Let's hide here.

1572
00:59:37,796 --> 00:59:41,720
(Stake out by one of their tables.)

1573
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,379
We can eat only when people come.

1574
00:59:44,617 --> 00:59:46,390
That looks like rice.

1575
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,078
Is that an ash tray?

1576
00:59:49,664 --> 00:59:51,867
My dad used to smoke...

1577
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:53,921
And quit.

1578
00:59:54,554 --> 00:59:55,554
How old is he?

1579
00:59:55,882 --> 00:59:57,273
He was born in 1971.

1580
00:59:57,382 --> 00:59:59,571
(Pause.)

1581
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,098
(What's wrong?)

1582
01:00:07,195 --> 01:00:08,540
I'm your uncle.

1583
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,281
(He's old enough to be most idols' dads.)

1584
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,007
1 year?

1585
01:00:18,335 --> 01:00:21,142
(He's older than Jung-gooks dad by 1 year.)

1586
01:00:21,187 --> 01:00:23,960
My dad did get married early.

1587
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,448
He's younger than my mom.

1588
01:00:27,492 --> 01:00:29,039
By how much?

1589
01:00:29,554 --> 01:00:30,554
By 2 years.

1590
01:00:30,898 --> 01:00:32,328
Do you know their love story?

1591
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:34,632
Mom hit on him first.

1592
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,351
(That sums everything up.)

1593
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:40,015
She said she did because dad

1594
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:41,149
was good looking.

1595
01:00:41,195 --> 01:00:42,195
Mom is...

1596
01:00:42,265 --> 01:00:43,265
Proactive?

1597
01:00:43,304 --> 01:00:44,304
Yes.

1598
01:00:44,367 --> 01:00:45,433
She's energetic.

1599
01:00:46,286 --> 01:00:50,203
Until his parents' love story was over,

1600
01:00:50,539 --> 01:00:52,998
no one came...

1601
01:00:55,171 --> 01:00:57,381
Do you need my help with anything?

1602
01:00:57,562 --> 01:00:59,781
It's okay.

1603
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:02,005
I really like cooking.

1604
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,460
I'd like to help.

1605
01:01:03,476 --> 01:01:05,507
Should I make some egg rolls?

1606
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:07,414
Sure...

1607
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:08,570
Just a second.

1608
01:01:08,734 --> 01:01:10,667
You cracked the eggs already?

1609
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:13,432
(Washes his hands firs)

1610
01:01:13,617 --> 01:01:15,750
Cooking at someone else's house...

1611
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,407
(Is awkward.)

1612
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:21,252
Do you know what a surprised car is?

1613
01:01:21,546 --> 01:01:23,039
A surprised car?

1614
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:24,870
Canola oil.

1615
01:01:25,078 --> 01:01:26,078
Sorry...

1616
01:01:31,289 --> 01:01:34,570
Your daughters said you're a great cook...

1617
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:38,515
They had high praises...

1618
01:01:39,585 --> 01:01:41,835
But you might be disappointed.

1619
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:44,233
I haven't had home cooking in a while.

1620
01:01:44,382 --> 01:01:48,373
(It's been whole 3 days...)

1621
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:51,114
(Tuna.)

1622
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:56,358
While stew with tuna and ham

1623
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:59,514
are cooking just as kids would love it...

1624
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:02,539
One man is deep in thought.

1625
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:05,620
How many eggs did you use?

1626
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,390
5.

1627
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,679
That's a lot to cook at once.

1628
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,570
I normally use 3 at a time...

1629
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:14,851
(5 eggs...)

1630
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,125
(What am I gonna do...)

1631
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,167
(Let's go!)

1632
01:02:18,429 --> 01:02:21,023
(Rolled.)

1633
01:02:21,023 --> 01:02:23,093
(Spread out again.)

1634
01:02:24,656 --> 01:02:27,522
(It's being cooked with some fancy skills.)

1635
01:02:28,617 --> 01:02:32,530
(He really was good at cooking.)

1636
01:02:33,476 --> 01:02:38,089
(His passion is on fire.)

1637
01:02:38,328 --> 01:02:40,921
(Careful.)

1638
01:02:41,203 --> 01:02:45,155
(Jin's egg rolls are ready!)

1639
01:02:46,148 --> 01:02:47,958
You're really good.

1640
01:02:48,851 --> 01:02:51,140
This is my first time cooking on TV...

1641
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,960
It's my first time too.

1642
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:01,328
Fish is almost cooked...

1643
01:03:04,616 --> 01:03:07,578
Delicious Kimchi in beautiful red...

1644
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,908
And Kimchi stew looking spicy as well...

1645
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:13,062
To top it off,

1646
01:03:13,062 --> 01:03:14,304
pepper paste fish.

1647
01:03:17,773 --> 01:03:19,226
These two men's cooking

1648
01:03:19,226 --> 01:03:20,601
is heating up the kitchen

1649
01:03:20,601 --> 01:03:22,117
as much as the pajama party.

1650
01:03:22,671 --> 01:03:25,150
(Meanwhile, in the living room...)

1651
01:03:25,203 --> 01:03:26,875
How long did you live here for?

1652
01:03:27,117 --> 01:03:28,117
3 years?

1653
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,039
3 years...

1654
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:32,218
Where did you live before?

1655
01:03:32,296 --> 01:03:33,296
Seochodong.

1656
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,640
Seochodong?

1657
01:03:35,476 --> 01:03:37,085
How do you like Samsungdong?

1658
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:39,039
Quiet...

1659
01:03:39,835 --> 01:03:42,502
Don't a lot of old people live here too?

1660
01:03:42,937 --> 01:03:44,054
There's nothing here!

1661
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,917
Not even convenience stores...

1662
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,320
Really?

1663
01:03:47,414 --> 01:03:48,414
Not that many.

1664
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,476
There were no pedestrians either!

1665
01:03:50,617 --> 01:03:51,617
Yup.

1666
01:03:53,093 --> 01:03:54,492
Why am I...

1667
01:03:54,843 --> 01:03:56,920
Interviewing them?

1668
01:03:58,937 --> 01:04:00,433
I'm not their teacher...

1669
01:04:00,562 --> 01:04:01,976
This is our first time having

1670
01:04:01,976 --> 01:04:03,414
this many students on our show.

1671
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,284
Elementary, middle school...

1672
01:04:06,765 --> 01:04:08,171
Don't I look like a principle?

1673
01:04:11,218 --> 01:04:15,155
When Jin was here, they were so excited.

1674
01:04:15,195 --> 01:04:17,328
After he left, they calmed down.

1675
01:04:19,632 --> 01:04:20,859
I think they feel like

1676
01:04:20,859 --> 01:04:22,390
they're talking to a teacher.

1677
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:25,946
(Only Jin disappeared...)

1678
01:04:26,531 --> 01:04:29,066
(Silence.)

1679
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,320
Can I go help?

1680
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,320
Sure.

1681
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:33,995
(They go help set the table...)

1682
01:04:34,835 --> 01:04:37,687
(He even plates the egg rolls beautifully!)

1683
01:04:37,851 --> 01:04:40,694
(But the fish disintegrated...)

1684
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:43,079
(Stew is complete.)

1685
01:04:43,242 --> 01:04:45,398
(They quickly move to get ready.)

1686
01:04:45,468 --> 01:04:46,468
9 people?

1687
01:04:48,554 --> 01:04:51,387
(Works hard.)

1688
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:54,187
Both of his daughters' friends are here.

1689
01:04:54,367 --> 01:04:56,900
This rice has to feed a lot of people.

1690
01:04:58,054 --> 01:05:00,588
Unused bowls have to come out as well.

1691
01:05:01,203 --> 01:05:03,827
He expertly hands out rice.

1692
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:05,335
Take this.

1693
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:07,765
(Kids take the food then places)

1694
01:05:07,765 --> 01:05:09,442
(them on a table.)

1695
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:13,320
(Table set!)

1696
01:05:13,554 --> 01:05:16,769
(Can't forget to take a picture!)

1697
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:23,429
This meal was made by a super dad and Jin

1698
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:26,929
for girls in Samsungdong.

1699
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,407
It's delicious and nutritious.

1700
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,632
(Dinner theater first!)

1701
01:05:36,507 --> 01:05:39,437
(Today has an audience too!)

1702
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:40,929
Okay.

1703
01:05:41,226 --> 01:05:43,726
When I say ready...

1704
01:05:43,726 --> 01:05:44,726
Say action!

1705
01:05:44,882 --> 01:05:46,500
Ready!

1706
01:05:46,703 --> 01:05:47,703
Action!

1707
01:05:47,812 --> 01:05:48,812
Let's eat.

1708
01:05:50,992 --> 01:05:52,946
Thanks for the food.

1709
01:05:53,038 --> 01:05:54,320
Thanks for the food.

1710
01:05:55,078 --> 01:05:57,988
(Very awkward...)

1711
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:01,742
Did you work hard

1712
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:03,320
at the art academy?

1713
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:04,539
I stopped going...

1714
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,507
I can't because of school exams...

1715
01:06:08,694 --> 01:06:09,695
Really?

1716
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,871
(Embarrassed.)

1717
01:06:11,953 --> 01:06:13,296
So only Jenny is studying?

1718
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,585
She didn't go either.

1719
01:06:15,757 --> 01:06:16,891
I had tutoring...

1720
01:06:16,937 --> 01:06:18,144
Her tutor came here.

1721
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,007
Jenny...

1722
01:06:21,132 --> 01:06:22,854
Is your middle school application

1723
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:23,854
start tomorrow?

1724
01:06:25,851 --> 01:06:26,851
Get ready.

1725
01:06:26,898 --> 01:06:27,898
Get prepared.

1726
01:06:28,429 --> 01:06:29,875
You never study.

1727
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,398
She always plays with her phone.

1728
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:34,499
BTS is coming back soon...

1729
01:06:35,272 --> 01:06:37,430
(What?)

1730
01:06:37,453 --> 01:06:40,039
(He feels guilty...)

1731
01:06:40,054 --> 01:06:42,078
I have to watch BTS with my phone...

1732
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,189
(Loss for words...)

1733
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,821
(Finished before things get serious.)

1734
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,367
I feel bad now...

1735
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:52,254
She doesn't study because of us...

1736
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,167
I feel so guilty...

1737
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:57,296
She doesn't study because of BTS!

1738
01:06:57,593 --> 01:06:58,789
Take a seat.

1739
01:06:58,843 --> 01:07:00,437
All we need is rice!

1740
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:03,359
(Finally a time to eat!)

1741
01:07:03,531 --> 01:07:04,753
Give him a round of applause!

1742
01:07:06,453 --> 01:07:08,058
I made the eggs.

1743
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:12,281
Try some.

1744
01:07:12,726 --> 01:07:14,117
Thank you!

1745
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,117
Enjoy!

1746
01:07:16,085 --> 01:07:17,351
Thank you for the food!

1747
01:07:17,664 --> 01:07:19,925
(They all go for the egg rolls!)

1748
01:07:21,835 --> 01:07:24,490
(Hesitates.)

1749
01:07:24,726 --> 01:07:27,177
(This is...)

1750
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:29,219
(Jin's egg rolls...)

1751
01:07:29,335 --> 01:07:30,335
She's like...

1752
01:07:30,492 --> 01:07:31,820
I can't eat this...

1753
01:07:31,898 --> 01:07:33,875
(Wants to cherish it forever.)

1754
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,087
(They should freeze it to keep it forever.)

1755
01:07:37,437 --> 01:07:39,156
(Jin, who was hungry,)

1756
01:07:39,187 --> 01:07:41,171
(is happy.)

1757
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,570
Hey guys...

1758
01:07:44,742 --> 01:07:46,608
You're the only fans who get

1759
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:49,246
to eat with Jin.

1760
01:07:50,453 --> 01:07:51,837
It's not in a big group either!

1761
01:07:51,945 --> 01:07:53,828
I always liked cooking.

1762
01:07:53,828 --> 01:07:56,132
I've been saying I want to cook

1763
01:07:56,132 --> 01:07:57,799
for the fans for a while.

1764
01:07:57,859 --> 01:07:59,523
And I finally got to today.

1765
01:07:59,523 --> 01:08:00,523
It's an honor.

1766
01:08:00,812 --> 01:08:03,400
(It's an honor for us...)

1767
01:08:03,453 --> 01:08:04,562
Did you really make this?

1768
01:08:05,296 --> 01:08:06,328
This Kimchi stew.

1769
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:07,375
Yes.

1770
01:08:07,437 --> 01:08:08,828
It's delicious!

1771
01:08:08,828 --> 01:08:09,828
Thank goodness.

1772
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:11,508
It's really good.

1773
01:08:12,414 --> 01:08:14,135
I really missed home cooking.

1774
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:16,381
We always deliver.

1775
01:08:16,429 --> 01:08:17,429
It's really good.

1776
01:08:17,476 --> 01:08:18,803
(Heartbroken...)

1777
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,640
I saw him cook eggs...

1778
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,435
He's really good.

1779
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:24,595
(Shy.)

1780
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:26,179
They met this family

1781
01:08:26,179 --> 01:08:27,367
When things were bleak.

1782
01:08:27,976 --> 01:08:30,117
Kyung-kyu is loving this meal...

1783
01:08:31,117 --> 01:08:32,726
It's delicious.

1784
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,764
(And...)

1785
01:08:37,195 --> 01:08:39,546
And Jin finally gets to enjoy home cooking

1786
01:08:39,546 --> 01:08:41,629
after 3 whole days.

1787
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:43,773
Did you make this too?

1788
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:48,764
(Can't get their eyes off of him.)

1789
01:08:48,882 --> 01:08:50,201
What's this?

1790
01:08:50,507 --> 01:08:52,533
Bean pepper fish!

1791
01:08:56,187 --> 01:08:58,015
Watching Jin fill up himself...

1792
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,074
These girls doesn't know how to

1793
01:09:01,117 --> 01:09:03,408
control themselves.

1794
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,210
And...

1795
01:09:06,437 --> 01:09:08,320
He got to feed the culprit

1796
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,234
that prevents his daughters from studying.

1797
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:16,132
Sorry, I have a cold...

1798
01:09:16,132 --> 01:09:18,520
(Heartbroken 2...)

1799
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:20,437
It's not serious.

1800
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,507
(Worried.)

1801
01:09:22,757 --> 01:09:24,957
My head!

1802
01:09:25,007 --> 01:09:26,007
Are you okay?

1803
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:28,605
When he said he had a cold...

1804
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:30,942
(Jealous of an idol...)

1805
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:34,000
(Keep it up!)

1806
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:35,554
These kids...

1807
01:09:35,914 --> 01:09:38,164
Love  BTS.

1808
01:09:38,164 --> 01:09:39,502
How is it as a father?

1809
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:41,882
Well...

1810
01:09:42,507 --> 01:09:43,570
I don't think it's bad.

1811
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:44,609
Really?

1812
01:09:46,585 --> 01:09:48,281
It'll be a problem if they don't study

1813
01:09:48,281 --> 01:09:50,547
and go to see their show everyday.

1814
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:52,914
My youngest daughter said...

1815
01:09:53,226 --> 01:09:54,893
She'll pass her next exam

1816
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,727
if I invited BTS to our house.

1817
01:09:58,289 --> 01:09:59,289
She promised.

1818
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,164
(A deal was struck.)

1819
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,864
When we were outside?

1820
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:04,304
When you said no,

1821
01:10:04,304 --> 01:10:06,331
she promised she'll pass her exam?

1822
01:10:06,531 --> 01:10:09,640
(She promised just to have a meal!)

1823
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:13,382
Someone came to our signing event...

1824
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:16,757
Said she's 1st in her class...

1825
01:10:16,945 --> 01:10:18,617
She said, she'll come back as

1826
01:10:18,617 --> 01:10:19,817
1st in her school,

1827
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:21,386
if I cheered her on.

1828
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:24,150
Then she really got 1st in her school.

1829
01:10:24,812 --> 01:10:26,345
You could be the reason

1830
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,576
for kids not studying.

1831
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,671
But you could also make them study.

1832
01:10:30,671 --> 01:10:31,671
Exactly.

1833
01:10:32,296 --> 01:10:34,645
(Under a huge pressure now...)

1834
01:10:34,687 --> 01:10:36,406
Do you cook like this often?

1835
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,500
I don't get to eat often at home lately...

1836
01:10:40,343 --> 01:10:41,343
Busy?

1837
01:10:41,468 --> 01:10:43,429
Kids leave early,

1838
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:45,280
I come back late.

1839
01:10:45,304 --> 01:10:46,853
We don't get to eat at home often.

1840
01:10:48,882 --> 01:10:50,171
Then where do you eat dinner

1841
01:10:50,171 --> 01:10:51,238
during the week?

1842
01:10:51,312 --> 01:10:55,257
Their mom cooks at home normally...

1843
01:10:56,695 --> 01:10:58,186
But since she's not here today...

1844
01:10:58,304 --> 01:11:00,931
We had chicken for a few days...

1845
01:11:01,117 --> 01:11:03,148
We got tired of it for a few days.

1846
01:11:03,351 --> 01:11:04,460
So decided to eat rice?

1847
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,466
I missed home cooking.

1848
01:11:06,531 --> 01:11:08,555
(It's a destiny!)

1849
01:11:08,648 --> 01:11:09,851
Perfect timing.

1850
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:11,210
Exactly.

1851
01:11:11,523 --> 01:11:13,320
Why did you allow a pajama party?

1852
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:15,468
They do it often.

1853
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:18,488
(They hold pajama parties often.)

1854
01:11:18,562 --> 01:11:20,117
They come over a lot.

1855
01:11:20,773 --> 01:11:22,460
My wife's friends come over a lot.

1856
01:11:23,476 --> 01:11:25,772
My wife is from Geojedo.

1857
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:28,918
When her friends come to Seoul,

1858
01:11:29,093 --> 01:11:30,960
they stay over at our house.

1859
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:32,913
How did your daughter

1860
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,320
start on a classical music?

1861
01:11:34,617 --> 01:11:36,460
She likes music.

1862
01:11:36,734 --> 01:11:38,445
When she sleeps at night...

1863
01:11:38,914 --> 01:11:41,524
She listens to BTS all the time!

1864
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:44,593
(Feels guilty.)

1865
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:47,867
What an honor.

1866
01:11:48,789 --> 01:11:49,867
When I go in my car,

1867
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,390
she changes the CD

1868
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:53,729
and plays BTS as soon as she's in the car.

1869
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:56,607
(Jenny's with BTS 24 hours a day.)

1870
01:11:56,664 --> 01:11:57,882
She promised her mom that

1871
01:11:57,882 --> 01:11:59,398
if she gets 100 on her exam,

1872
01:11:59,484 --> 01:12:01,126
she wanted a BTS CD.

1873
01:12:03,203 --> 01:12:04,203
Did you get it?

1874
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:06,054
She didn't get 100 yet.

1875
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,500
I did!

1876
01:12:08,421 --> 01:12:09,945
Isn't that a really good score?

1877
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:10,992
It is!

1878
01:12:11,054 --> 01:12:13,187
People who like BTS,

1879
01:12:13,492 --> 01:12:14,854
are all nice.

1880
01:12:15,187 --> 01:12:16,695
Our fans are all nice.

1881
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:18,696
I'm a huge BTS fan!

1882
01:12:19,742 --> 01:12:21,335
(Everyone unites under BTS.)

1883
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:22,976
Do you know our members' names?

1884
01:12:23,414 --> 01:12:25,054
I only need you and Jung-seok.

1885
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:26,117
Jung-gook...

1886
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:29,859
(He doesn't even remember)

1887
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,117
(what he did yesterday.)

1888
01:12:31,164 --> 01:12:32,468
Do you know all 7's birthdays?

1889
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:33,531
Yes!

1890
01:12:33,585 --> 01:12:34,585
Really?

1891
01:12:34,773 --> 01:12:35,867
When's V's birthday?

1892
01:12:36,054 --> 01:12:37,468
12/30.

1893
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:39,367
They do know!

1894
01:12:39,617 --> 01:12:40,617
Jung-gook?

1895
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:41,710
9/1.

1896
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:43,570
And?

1897
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,031
9/12.

1898
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,070
3/9.

1899
01:12:46,117 --> 01:12:48,261
(They're on top of their stuff.)

1900
01:12:48,335 --> 01:12:49,523
How do you know all that?

1901
01:12:50,085 --> 01:12:52,789
When's Jin's birthday?

1902
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:53,976
12/4!

1903
01:12:55,164 --> 01:12:56,164
My birthday?

1904
01:12:56,882 --> 01:12:58,680
How would they know that?

1905
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:01,085
No?

1906
01:13:01,132 --> 01:13:02,132
7/3!

1907
01:13:02,202 --> 01:13:04,180
(1/365 chance to get it right.)

1908
01:13:04,819 --> 01:13:05,820
Your dad's birthday?

1909
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:07,195
8/14.

1910
01:13:07,218 --> 01:13:08,218
January?

1911
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:10,122
(Quickly closes her mouth.)

1912
01:13:10,218 --> 01:13:12,603
(Gotta laugh it out...)

1913
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,216
(Embarrassed.)

1914
01:13:15,272 --> 01:13:17,205
(Let's go play in the room.)

1915
01:13:18,117 --> 01:13:20,007
Kids who finished the father's cooking

1916
01:13:20,007 --> 01:13:21,007
leaves...

1917
01:13:21,632 --> 01:13:22,766
The two daughters

1918
01:13:22,781 --> 01:13:24,447
and their father remains.

1919
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:26,570
What's hard about raising daughters?

1920
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:28,539
Isn't this the worst time?

1921
01:13:28,585 --> 01:13:30,070
When they're on puberty?

1922
01:13:30,242 --> 01:13:33,639
My wife and I are different in that sense.

1923
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,132
Because they're girls,

1924
01:13:35,695 --> 01:13:37,781
they go through things only girls

1925
01:13:37,781 --> 01:13:38,781
go through.

1926
01:13:39,023 --> 01:13:40,695
They need their mom for that.

1927
01:13:40,695 --> 01:13:41,695
Exactly.

1928
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:44,054
There are things I can't do anything about.

1929
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,466
That's what's tough for me.

1930
01:13:46,632 --> 01:13:48,673
But my wife is really good with that.

1931
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:50,617
She talks to them a lot.

1932
01:13:51,234 --> 01:13:52,710
Are both of your daughters...

1933
01:13:52,976 --> 01:13:54,945
Past puberty?

1934
01:13:55,054 --> 01:13:56,445
The older one did.

1935
01:13:57,757 --> 01:13:59,118
Jenny's just getting started.

1936
01:14:01,289 --> 01:14:02,851
Just slightly.

1937
01:14:02,992 --> 01:14:03,992
How?

1938
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:07,723
Because of her puberty...

1939
01:14:08,132 --> 01:14:10,320
When I tell her to study,

1940
01:14:10,468 --> 01:14:11,468
she says, wait!

1941
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:14,007
Wait for what?

1942
01:14:14,757 --> 01:14:16,203
(Embarrassed.)

1943
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:18,041
(She's becoming more independent.)

1944
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:19,289
Does she know

1945
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:20,703
that she's on puberty?

1946
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,148
It happened to my daughter too.

1947
01:14:23,953 --> 01:14:25,811
But I had male menopause.

1948
01:14:26,734 --> 01:14:27,950
I won.

1949
01:14:30,945 --> 01:14:32,945
Are you comfortable with your dad?

1950
01:14:33,648 --> 01:14:34,648
I...

1951
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:35,710
She likes dad more.

1952
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:37,750
More than mom?

1953
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:38,875
Yup!

1954
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:40,875
You're gonna be in trouble!

1955
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,960
Mom's scary...

1956
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:44,554
Mothers do nag.

1957
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:47,570
(Her dad is like her friend.)

1958
01:14:48,093 --> 01:14:49,093
Yes...

1959
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:50,585
Dad or BTS?

1960
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:51,679
BTS.

1961
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:56,626
(Didn't even think for 1 second.)

1962
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:58,908
(Guilty as charged...)

1963
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,070
She said BTS...

1964
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:02,382
But he's really good looking.

1965
01:15:02,953 --> 01:15:04,117
(Thank you.)

1966
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,179
No wonder kids like them.

1967
01:15:06,773 --> 01:15:08,101
I spent the whole day with him.

1968
01:15:08,218 --> 01:15:09,618
He's really nice too.

1969
01:15:10,718 --> 01:15:12,000
He's a great person.

1970
01:15:12,093 --> 01:15:13,507
I am very nice.

1971
01:15:14,539 --> 01:15:16,463
(Compliments himself.)

1972
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:17,992
I know I'm the one who said it.

1973
01:15:17,992 --> 01:15:18,992
But it's true.

1974
01:15:19,242 --> 01:15:20,242
Okay.

1975
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:23,698
Time to give compliments.

1976
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,631
They're both the same...

1977
01:15:26,164 --> 01:15:27,497
They're really nice.

1978
01:15:27,585 --> 01:15:29,656
They listen to their parents well.

1979
01:15:29,742 --> 01:15:30,808
That's the best.

1980
01:15:31,429 --> 01:15:32,882
That's the best.

1981
01:15:33,382 --> 01:15:34,382
Why don't you

1982
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:36,570
thank your father for letting

1983
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,370
BTS into his house tonight?

1984
01:15:38,609 --> 01:15:40,742
We could've gone somewhere else.

1985
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,476
Thank you for saying yes.

1986
01:15:44,226 --> 01:15:46,515
(Her shy gratitude makes him laugh.)

1987
01:15:46,515 --> 01:15:48,367
(Happy.)

1988
01:15:48,413 --> 01:15:50,820
This dad tries to understand his daughter's

1989
01:15:50,867 --> 01:15:53,764
puberty and love for BTS.

1990
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:54,890
Meanwhile...

1991
01:15:55,054 --> 01:15:58,068
They didn't find anyone to talk to yet.

1992
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,226
Right about now...

1993
01:16:00,867 --> 01:16:02,523
Today's Sunday...

1994
01:16:02,914 --> 01:16:05,796
People sleep early on Sundays.

1995
01:16:05,851 --> 01:16:07,210
If it was during the week...

1996
01:16:07,695 --> 01:16:09,664
People could be getting off work late

1997
01:16:09,664 --> 01:16:11,960
and stop by on the way back.

1998
01:16:12,164 --> 01:16:13,489
To get something quick.

1999
01:16:13,489 --> 01:16:14,489
Exactly.

2000
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:16,429
Someone's here.

2001
01:16:16,429 --> 01:16:17,429
Act natural.

2002
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,431
Hope he comes here.

2003
01:16:22,648 --> 01:16:25,701
(Pretends to not look...)

2004
01:16:26,687 --> 01:16:28,882
He's buying beer.

2005
01:16:29,898 --> 01:16:31,054
Beer?

2006
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:34,260
(Beer and ramen would be perfect.)

2007
01:16:34,351 --> 01:16:35,828
It's so good right before sleeping.

2008
01:16:35,976 --> 01:16:37,940
But he's leaving.

2009
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,203
He wants to drink right before he sleeps.

2010
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:45,625
Wait.

2011
01:16:45,804 --> 01:16:49,545
(Someone goes in with a kid.)

2012
01:16:50,117 --> 01:16:52,117
(Takes a peak.)

2013
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:56,351
Coming here must mean they live here.

2014
01:16:57,789 --> 01:16:59,003
They're leaving...

2015
01:16:59,187 --> 01:17:01,421
(Most people go home.)

2016
01:17:03,671 --> 01:17:05,179
(When he was about to complain...)

2017
01:17:05,179 --> 01:17:06,882
Someone's here!

2018
01:17:06,882 --> 01:17:09,922
(This customer is alone.)

2019
01:17:11,109 --> 01:17:12,518
Maybe he'll eat alone!

2020
01:17:14,015 --> 01:17:15,507
A lone wolf type.

2021
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,912
Lone wolf...

2022
01:17:16,984 --> 01:17:20,141
(His filter doesn't work out of hunger.)

2023
01:17:20,664 --> 01:17:21,898
Someone who eats alone,

2024
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:23,093
watches movies alone,

2025
01:17:23,093 --> 01:17:24,493
and does a BBQ alone.

2026
01:17:24,523 --> 01:17:26,788
(Choosing carefully.)

2027
01:17:27,421 --> 01:17:28,922
You're unstoppable!

2028
01:17:29,343 --> 01:17:31,077
Buy ramen!

2029
01:17:32,007 --> 01:17:33,007
Ramen!

2030
01:17:33,085 --> 01:17:34,085
He's leaving...

2031
01:17:34,789 --> 01:17:37,491
(He didn't buy anything.)

2032
01:17:37,968 --> 01:17:40,164
(20 minutes left.)

2033
01:17:41,734 --> 01:17:43,429
Isn't this a TF?

2034
01:17:43,695 --> 01:17:45,125
A total failure.

2035
01:17:47,007 --> 01:17:49,460
I want to call someone

2036
01:17:49,578 --> 01:17:51,111
and act like a stranger...

2037
01:17:51,242 --> 01:17:53,894
(To have a meal.)

2038
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,963
(He's that desperate.)

2039
01:17:58,296 --> 01:17:59,828
What are your concerns?

2040
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:00,843
Concerns?

2041
01:18:01,984 --> 01:18:03,835
I used to be the Knee Drop Guru.

2042
01:18:04,335 --> 01:18:05,476
Do you know what that is?

2043
01:18:05,476 --> 01:18:06,476
Of course I do!

2044
01:18:08,414 --> 01:18:09,640
You watched it?

2045
01:18:09,742 --> 01:18:13,609
(What's Jung-gook worried about?)

2046
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,585
When I was in a puberty...

2047
01:18:16,976 --> 01:18:19,304
I came to Seoul alone...

2048
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:26,281
When I meet someone for the first time...

2049
01:18:27,601 --> 01:18:29,406
I don't feel completely sincere

2050
01:18:29,406 --> 01:18:31,367
in how I act.

2051
01:18:32,164 --> 01:18:33,507
It feels like there's a wall.

2052
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,210
To get close,

2053
01:18:36,265 --> 01:18:38,465
we need to understand each other.

2054
01:18:38,945 --> 01:18:41,212
But I worry about what should I do

2055
01:18:41,796 --> 01:18:43,663
to make this person like me?

2056
01:18:44,531 --> 01:18:48,335
I feel like I'm wearing a mask...

2057
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:53,187
You want to be more sincere with people?

2058
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:54,187
Yes.

2059
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:57,606
(Told Ho-dong what he's worried about.)

2060
01:18:58,507 --> 01:19:00,405
You started working too early.

2061
01:19:00,405 --> 01:19:02,493
I think so too.

2062
01:19:02,493 --> 01:19:04,132
(It was his survival instincts.)

2063
01:19:04,132 --> 01:19:05,468
But on the other hand...

2064
01:19:05,734 --> 01:19:07,398
I used to wrestle...

2065
01:19:07,937 --> 01:19:09,156
To be the champion,

2066
01:19:09,156 --> 01:19:11,478
you can't just have one style.

2067
01:19:13,257 --> 01:19:14,453
Against a tall person,

2068
01:19:14,585 --> 01:19:16,187
you need to put your right leg more

2069
01:19:16,203 --> 01:19:18,031
to put more pressure with your weight.

2070
01:19:18,031 --> 01:19:19,738
Against a smaller person,

2071
01:19:19,976 --> 01:19:23,677
you need to try to bring him inside.

2072
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:25,507
You need different styles

2073
01:19:25,507 --> 01:19:26,609
for different people.

2074
01:19:28,233 --> 01:19:29,405
That's complicated.

2075
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:32,328
Depending on people you meet,

2076
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,739
you're changing how you treat them.

2077
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:37,249
That's right.

2078
01:19:37,562 --> 01:19:39,539
Being open to many stances...

2079
01:19:41,078 --> 01:19:42,398
Could be a good thing?

2080
01:19:42,398 --> 01:19:43,390
Exactly!

2081
01:19:43,757 --> 01:19:45,107
(He may look happy,)

2082
01:19:45,107 --> 01:19:46,579
(but he had his issues too.)

2083
01:19:47,226 --> 01:19:49,759
A little boy who wanted to be an idol,

2084
01:19:50,351 --> 01:19:52,751
broke out of his shells to the world

2085
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:57,812
and took over the world by storm.

2086
01:19:59,914 --> 01:20:01,132
Should we say it out loud?

2087
01:20:01,765 --> 01:20:03,460
(Goes back being the Guru.)

2088
01:20:04,085 --> 01:20:05,843
Here's my solution.

2089
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:07,906
Today's client...

2090
01:20:08,914 --> 01:20:10,476
Look over there!

2091
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:12,710
That tree!

2092
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:13,937
That tree!

2093
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
That flower!

2094
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:17,253
Change their appearance every seasons.

2095
01:20:19,187 --> 01:20:22,186
Every sides of Jung-gook!

2096
01:20:23,242 --> 01:20:24,242
Is who you are!

2097
01:20:25,312 --> 01:20:27,297
(Touched.)

2098
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,832
Stay positive!

2099
01:20:34,203 --> 01:20:35,710
I have goosebumps.

2100
01:20:35,757 --> 01:20:38,687
(Ho-dong's happy with his solution too.)

2101
01:20:38,687 --> 01:20:39,687
Everybody!

2102
01:20:40,109 --> 01:20:42,007
(Ceremony for solving a crisis.)

2103
01:20:42,007 --> 01:20:44,009
(He's too skinny...)

2104
01:20:44,054 --> 01:20:46,664
The guru solved the problem...

2105
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:49,426
But no one's here to give them a meal.

2106
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:51,541
(Worried about a meal.)

2107
01:20:51,617 --> 01:20:54,019
(Worried.)

2108
01:20:54,968 --> 01:20:56,168
15 minutes left...

2109
01:20:59,031 --> 01:21:01,491
(They're choosing what to eat.)

2110
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:03,430
They're buying gimbap.

2111
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,890
It's a matter of eating here

2112
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:07,090
or taking it home.

2113
01:21:08,101 --> 01:21:09,960
Please...

2114
01:21:10,289 --> 01:21:11,859
(Desperate.)

2115
01:21:18,585 --> 01:21:20,886
(Transaction complete.)

2116
01:21:21,195 --> 01:21:23,274
(Please eat here!)

2117
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:24,867
Can their desperate plea

2118
01:21:24,867 --> 01:21:27,164
become true?

2119
01:21:29,835 --> 01:21:32,042
(Didn't even turn back.)

2120
01:21:36,187 --> 01:21:37,546
That's how...

2121
01:21:38,242 --> 01:21:39,242
Our saviors...

2122
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:41,484
Left.

2123
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:45,729
I'm getting mosquito bites.

2124
01:21:45,914 --> 01:21:47,964
(Would they really fail?)

2125
01:21:47,964 --> 01:21:49,123
We have 5 minutes.

2126
01:21:49,296 --> 01:21:50,615
I can't stay seated.

2127
01:21:53,804 --> 01:21:56,528
(A car stopped in front of them.)

2128
01:21:56,528 --> 01:21:58,081
(What?)

2129
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:00,045
(Someone's getting off...)

2130
01:22:00,085 --> 01:22:01,938
I heard the news!

2131
01:22:02,054 --> 01:22:03,257
You scared me!

2132
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,849
I heard the news!

2133
01:22:05,593 --> 01:22:07,130
(Did he see a ghost?)

2134
01:22:07,554 --> 01:22:09,737
(Who is it?)

2135
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:11,382
(A familiar voice.)

2136
01:22:11,382 --> 01:22:12,567
Did you get to eat?

2137
01:22:13,398 --> 01:22:14,398
No?

2138
01:22:14,414 --> 01:22:16,387
(Kim Nam-ju's husband, Kim Seung-woo.)

2139
01:22:16,945 --> 01:22:18,656
(A celebrity couple for the first time)

2140
01:22:18,656 --> 01:22:20,186
(in our show!)

2141
01:22:20,304 --> 01:22:21,638
(He's confused too.)

2142
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,710
I'm sorry..

2143
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:24,273
We saw your wife!

2144
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,895
She told me over the phone!

2145
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:29,054
What are you up to?

2146
01:22:29,054 --> 01:22:30,484
I'm on my way home!

2147
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:31,804
This is a coincidence?

2148
01:22:31,804 --> 01:22:33,647
I live right there!

2149
01:22:34,656 --> 01:22:35,656
Did you eat?

2150
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:37,304
You saw us on your way back?

2151
01:22:37,429 --> 01:22:39,203
How could I miss you!

2152
01:22:39,242 --> 01:22:40,979
(Huge.)

2153
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:43,437
We have 3 minutes left...

2154
01:22:44,257 --> 01:22:45,539
If nothing happens in 3 minutes,

2155
01:22:45,539 --> 01:22:46,539
we fail.

2156
01:22:46,554 --> 01:22:47,585
I can't buy it for you?

2157
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:48,796
No...

2158
01:22:48,859 --> 01:22:49,882
You have to starve?

2159
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:51,212
Can you give them a wave?

2160
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:52,593
They're still shooting.

2161
01:22:52,695 --> 01:22:53,695
Just wave.

2162
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,094
Give them a wave.

2163
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,515
When are you coming to our show?

2164
01:22:57,742 --> 01:22:58,898
You need to go eat.

2165
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,445
When are you coming to our show?

2166
01:23:05,289 --> 01:23:08,748
My wife's doing a new drama on JTBC!

2167
01:23:09,195 --> 01:23:10,195
So...

2168
01:23:10,281 --> 01:23:11,354
Call her!

2169
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:12,354
That's better!

2170
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:13,421
That'd be great.

2171
01:23:13,734 --> 01:23:15,838
I'm really sorry for not eating...

2172
01:23:15,906 --> 01:23:17,523
Jung-gook from BTS!

2173
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
BTS!

2174
01:23:19,054 --> 01:23:20,109
He's the youngest.

2175
01:23:20,109 --> 01:23:21,344
Nice to meet you!

2176
01:23:21,344 --> 01:23:23,402
Your niece is a huge fan!

2177
01:23:23,546 --> 01:23:24,929
That's right!

2178
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,133
Is my voice getting recorded?

2179
01:23:28,398 --> 01:23:29,398
Of course!

2180
01:23:29,476 --> 01:23:30,476
Then I'll use honorifics.

2181
01:23:30,531 --> 01:23:31,531
That's fine!

2182
01:23:32,859 --> 01:23:34,717
(See you later.)

2183
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,945
Thank you!

2184
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,515
Bye.

2185
01:23:38,539 --> 01:23:39,539
Thanks.

2186
01:23:39,601 --> 01:23:40,781
What did you have for dinner?

2187
01:23:40,914 --> 01:23:41,914
I had noodles.

2188
01:23:43,382 --> 01:23:45,031
There's a delicious restaurant there.

2189
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:47,359
Thanks!

2190
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:48,773
Bye!

2191
01:23:50,132 --> 01:23:51,132
Wow.

2192
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:52,164
(Thank you Kim Seung-woo)

2193
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:54,498
(for coming on to our show.)

2194
01:23:54,835 --> 01:23:57,320
Instead of a meal,

2195
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,370
they got to meet Seung-woo.

2196
01:24:02,257 --> 01:24:04,156
It's too early to say we failed.

2197
01:24:04,156 --> 01:24:05,156
We still have 2 minutes.

2198
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,250
2 minutes?

2199
01:24:06,304 --> 01:24:08,224
2 minutes is an eternity.

2200
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:12,048
(But he feels the hunger...)

2201
01:24:12,351 --> 01:24:14,093
We went to a convenience store

2202
01:24:14,093 --> 01:24:15,093
in Neungdong.

2203
01:24:15,226 --> 01:24:16,226
No guests came.

2204
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:18,542
(We even ate with a dog...)

2205
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:20,963
(Don't give up yet.)

2206
01:24:23,023 --> 01:24:25,239
(Someone's here!)

2207
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:28,981
(Someone came with a minute left!)

2208
01:24:29,703 --> 01:24:30,984
I feel like this is it.

2209
01:24:31,085 --> 01:24:32,685
This is our last chance.

2210
01:24:34,023 --> 01:24:35,613
I'm looking forward to eating...

2211
01:24:36,085 --> 01:24:37,800
He's at the food section!

2212
01:24:39,195 --> 01:24:40,194
Ramen!

2213
01:24:40,445 --> 01:24:41,750
He got ramen!

2214
01:24:45,992 --> 01:24:49,367
(Another miracle?)

2215
01:24:49,914 --> 01:24:50,914
Please...

2216
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:53,921
I can't believe this is happening.

2217
01:24:54,015 --> 01:24:55,015
Its 9:30!

2218
01:24:56,164 --> 01:24:57,164
Wow.

2219
01:24:57,757 --> 01:25:00,054
(Unbelievable.)

2220
01:25:00,085 --> 01:25:01,304
(He goes to the cashier!)

2221
01:25:03,421 --> 01:25:05,648
(Please eat here!)

2222
01:25:05,781 --> 01:25:06,781
He's paying.

2223
01:25:07,976 --> 01:25:09,523
He should open it anytime now.

2224
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:13,021
Eating outside is always more delicious!

2225
01:25:14,164 --> 01:25:15,164
But...

2226
01:25:15,882 --> 01:25:18,111
Will the last guest...

2227
01:25:18,492 --> 01:25:20,930
Make the miracle happen?

2228
01:25:22,703 --> 01:25:24,695
Will the last guest...

2229
01:25:25,429 --> 01:25:27,878
Make the miracle happen?

2230
01:25:29,414 --> 01:25:32,060
(Ho-dong to the rescue.)

2231
01:25:32,578 --> 01:25:33,578
Hi.

2232
01:25:33,664 --> 01:25:34,797
I'm Kang Ho-dong.

2233
01:25:35,015 --> 01:25:37,039
What did you just buy?

2234
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:38,437
Just...

2235
01:25:38,515 --> 01:25:39,515
Ramen?

2236
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:41,888
Why don't you eat it here?

2237
01:25:42,023 --> 01:25:43,223
It's for tomorrow.

2238
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:44,723
Did you eat dinner already?

2239
01:25:44,835 --> 01:25:45,835
Yes.

2240
01:25:46,492 --> 01:25:47,773
Enjoy rest of your night!

2241
01:25:51,031 --> 01:25:52,031
Bye!

2242
01:25:52,117 --> 01:25:53,772
(They...)

2243
01:25:54,289 --> 01:25:58,031
(Completely failed for the first time.)

2244
01:26:00,414 --> 01:26:01,814
This is a let down...

2245
01:26:03,132 --> 01:26:05,496
(Deep sigh.)

2246
01:26:06,015 --> 01:26:07,640
They desperately wanted a meal

2247
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,640
in Samsungdong.

2248
01:26:09,695 --> 01:26:11,828
They tried their best to get it...

2249
01:26:14,164 --> 01:26:15,990
We just ate...

2250
01:26:16,101 --> 01:26:18,404
But their dreams didn't come true.

2251
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:24,070
In the end...

2252
01:26:24,398 --> 01:26:25,695
They couldn't find anyone

2253
01:26:25,695 --> 01:26:27,492
at the convenience store either.

2254
01:26:28,179 --> 01:26:30,304
The win the prize of being a first team

2255
01:26:30,304 --> 01:26:32,054
to completely fail in our show.

2256
01:26:33,007 --> 01:26:34,571
(Sad.)

2257
01:26:34,687 --> 01:26:36,453
Ho-dong and Jung-gook tried very hard

2258
01:26:36,453 --> 01:26:37,453
as a team.

2259
01:26:37,585 --> 01:26:39,031
We broke every single record

2260
01:26:39,031 --> 01:26:40,226
on a show that's 1 year old.

2261
01:26:41,789 --> 01:26:43,968
(Dizzy.)

2262
01:26:44,101 --> 01:26:46,932
(It's funny and sad at the same time.)

2263
01:26:47,054 --> 01:26:48,188
A record breaker.

2264
01:26:48,218 --> 01:26:49,898
That's what BTS is.

2265
01:26:49,976 --> 01:26:50,976
TF.

2266
01:26:51,945 --> 01:26:54,048
The first guest to totally fail.

2267
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,375
TF...

2268
01:26:55,429 --> 01:26:58,703
We went to a celebrities house

2269
01:26:58,757 --> 01:27:00,945
completely unaware.

2270
01:27:00,992 --> 01:27:03,781
And a couple were both in our show!

2271
01:27:03,781 --> 01:27:04,781
Exactly.

2272
01:27:04,945 --> 01:27:06,078
It was so random!

2273
01:27:07,312 --> 01:27:09,070
Out of all the firsts...

2274
01:27:09,484 --> 01:27:11,210
The best one is...

2275
01:27:12,382 --> 01:27:14,382
The total failure.

2276
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:15,429
TF.

2277
01:27:15,492 --> 01:27:17,027
Couldn't eat until the end...

2278
01:27:17,898 --> 01:27:19,570
I need to buy something on the way back.

2279
01:27:20,546 --> 01:27:21,656
You can't eat today.

2280
01:27:21,656 --> 01:27:22,656
I can't?

2281
01:27:23,789 --> 01:27:26,979
It's on effect until I fall asleep?

2282
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:30,523
His goal of the day became fasting...

2283
01:27:31,406 --> 01:27:32,406
Meanwhile,

2284
01:27:32,828 --> 01:27:34,361
Jin is doing the dishes

2285
01:27:34,429 --> 01:27:36,082
after a great meal.

2286
01:27:36,234 --> 01:27:37,234
That's okay.

2287
01:27:38,265 --> 01:27:39,945
Our fans said they really like you.

2288
01:27:41,945 --> 01:27:43,012
Your fan club...

2289
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:46,103
Has protected me a lot.

2290
01:27:46,203 --> 01:27:47,936
You yell BTS all the time.

2291
01:27:49,718 --> 01:27:52,304
(Shiny.)

2292
01:27:52,398 --> 01:27:53,398
Guys!

2293
01:27:54,171 --> 01:27:55,250
He's about to sing.

2294
01:27:55,632 --> 01:27:58,083
(Getting ready for the party.)

2295
01:27:58,242 --> 01:28:00,117
Take a seat.

2296
01:28:00,117 --> 01:28:02,145
(Gets to promote his new song.)

2297
01:28:02,156 --> 01:28:05,414
Tell us what kind of a song it is.

2298
01:28:09,578 --> 01:28:11,242
The title song for our album, DNA,

2299
01:28:11,265 --> 01:28:13,039
is saying our love has been connected

2300
01:28:13,078 --> 01:28:14,078
since the beginning.

2301
01:28:14,476 --> 01:28:17,313
That's what the song's about.

2302
01:28:18,257 --> 01:28:21,445
(Live performance begins.)

2303
01:28:21,445 --> 01:28:23,839
(I must be dreaming.)

2304
01:28:25,882 --> 01:28:29,632
(They won't be able to sleep tonight.)

2305
01:28:29,765 --> 01:28:31,287
(Stay cool.)

2306
01:28:31,367 --> 01:28:32,767
In our previous life,

2307
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:34,141
in our next life...

2308
01:28:34,757 --> 01:28:36,905
(He's pretty good.)

2309
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:42,775
(A round of applause.)

2310
01:28:43,882 --> 01:28:45,289
It's not released yet!

2311
01:28:45,444 --> 01:28:46,773
Give him a round of applause!

2312
01:28:46,835 --> 01:28:48,835
(DNA promotion was a success!)

2313
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:50,539
(Time to take a photo.)

2314
01:28:50,539 --> 01:28:52,064
(Their father goes to the end.)

2315
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,351
My kids will be happy if he's

2316
01:28:53,351 --> 01:28:54,351
in the middle.

2317
01:28:54,671 --> 01:28:57,666
(His daughters love their dad right now.)

2318
01:28:58,335 --> 01:28:59,890
 (Gives him a spoon.)

2319
01:29:03,898 --> 01:29:04,898
BTS!

2320
01:29:07,351 --> 01:29:08,351
Guys!

2321
01:29:09,117 --> 01:29:11,459
(What everyone was waiting for.)

2322
01:29:11,601 --> 01:29:13,570
One, two, three!

2323
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:17,710
With a huge welcome from the girls,

2324
01:29:18,164 --> 01:29:20,179
a house who offered a meal, #80

2325
01:29:20,179 --> 01:29:21,779
was born in Samsungdong.

2326
01:29:22,164 --> 01:29:23,430
We had a great time

2327
01:29:23,507 --> 01:29:25,118
with Let's Have Dinner Together.

2328
01:29:25,296 --> 01:29:27,304
Let's go Let's Have Dinner Together!

2329
01:29:32,937 --> 01:29:34,851
This show is so fun!

2330
01:29:35,062 --> 01:29:37,101
You said it was difficult!

2331
01:29:37,241 --> 01:29:38,242
It was before.

2332
01:29:38,281 --> 01:29:40,354
But it was really fun.

2333
01:29:40,601 --> 01:29:43,665
I feel at one with that family's peace...

2334
01:29:43,984 --> 01:29:46,554
I thought I was a part of that family.

2335
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:47,710
Good work.

2336
01:29:52,406 --> 01:29:53,866
(On their way home...)

2337
01:29:57,312 --> 01:29:59,085
Adults used to say if you whistle at night,

2338
01:29:59,085 --> 01:30:00,750
snakes will come out.

2339
01:30:01,601 --> 01:30:03,366
My grandpa told me to not whistle.

2340
01:30:05,296 --> 01:30:07,386
That was our new song...

2341
01:30:07,453 --> 01:30:08,453
Your whistle?

2342
01:30:10,015 --> 01:30:12,464
(They didn't get to eat today)

2343
01:30:12,601 --> 01:30:15,192
(but they don't let that bring them down.)

2344
01:30:15,289 --> 01:30:16,992
Jung-gook, 1,2,3!

2345
01:30:21,656 --> 01:30:22,929
A dinner to wipe

2346
01:30:22,929 --> 01:30:24,585
your blood, sweat and tears...

2347
01:30:24,609 --> 01:30:26,365
Would you like to join us?

2348
01:30:26,389 --> 01:30:28,389
