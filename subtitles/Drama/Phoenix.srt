{20575}{20675}Natives on this island. They build this huge fucking wall, designed to keep out king kong
{20675}{20697}wouldn't you?

{20967}{21038}They built a wall, to keep out this giant gorilla .
{21038}{21121}why the fuck did they put two giant doors in it big enough for kong to fit through ?

{21250}{21281}but he can't climb this wall
{21281}{21349}did they coat it with KY jelly or something, it doesnt make sense.

{69499}{69528}It's very brave of you.
{69566}{69628}I'll have to set a meeting with your attorney's office.
{69679}{69736}Now you do realize it's gonna be difficult for you to testify.
{69736}{69790}You are aware of that.
{69790}{69873}I did what i did for my husband,|lieutenant.
{69912}{69978}It won't be difficult to testify against that pig Henshaw.
{70639}{70659}yeah.
{70659}{70732}-Louie.|-Mike.

{71765}{71801}Fascinating stuff.
{71834}{71957}I watched a story|the other day about relationships.
{71957}{72057}about fish, Sharks, barnacles, crabs.
{72104}{72136}they achieve something.
{72137}{72173}which i strive for.
{72173}{72253}it's called parasitic castration.
{72274}{72368}The barnacle lives and grows inside certain crabs.
{72401}{72485}a mass of fibre, extends through the crab and actually alters
{72485}{72598}the body of the crab, into a female,|regardless of what sex it was.
{72630}{72661}The barnacles reproduce.
{72723}{72748}But not the crab.
{72765}{72791}Fascinating shit!
{72829}{72844}yeah!
{72886}{72942}Louie, check it out!
{73018}{73038}Thank you, Norm.
{73038}{73074}Want me to stick around?

{74498}{74525}Full of them.
{74535}{74561}like leeches.
{74561}{74641}they crawl into the bluefish , for example.
{74641}{74701}And suck the blood out of them.
{74743}{74818}The leeches have to keep the bluefish alive.
{74818}{74907}otherwise, the leech dies.
{74931}{74998}The barnacles have to keep the crabs alive.
{75029}{75082}otherwise the barnacles die.
{75172}{75194}Am i getting throught to you?
{75248}{75272}Abso-fucking-lutely
{75277}{75367}You want to make an example|out of somebody who owes me money,

{79472}{79491}what about me?
{79506}{79582}you don't want me to wack Chicago because there's a bullshit code that

{83924}{83978}I can drive a lousy car, James.

{84179}{84203}what the fuck does that mean ?
{84203}{84229}Stop, stop, stop.

{84659}{84683}-Right.|- Ok!

{84729}{84781}I would have felt more comfortable if Fred is driving the fucking car.
{84781}{84815}What's the big fucking deal?
{84822}{84904}- Will you pay him out of your money.|- Fine! whatever,Come on!
{84960}{84989}Fred, you're driving the car.
{84989}{85013}Sit down.
{85450}{85474}Robert Johnson, huh?
{85498}{85532}it's a very antique jukebox !?
{85566}{85589}How are you ?
{85651}{85668}What's the name of this song ?
{85668}{85735}Terraplane Blues.
{85735}{85769}My grandpa used to have this car.
{85769}{85851}Said he got it to 88 miles/h and that was in 1938.
{85851}{85891}The song isn't about a car.
{85891}{85915}Really?
{85915}{85987}You think there's a hidden meaning to the line: who's been 
{85987}{86057}Driving my Terraplane Blues since i've been gone?
{86102}{86176}Maybe i'm wrong, but the line :| i'm gonna get down deep in this connection
{86176}{86224}keep on tanglin' with your wires
{86224}{86299}Seems to me it's about a guy singing about a shortage in his wiring system.
{86299}{86374}I flash my lights, mama,|but this horn won't even blow.
{86411}{86456}Aha,little generator won't get the spark.

{89688}{89703}i can't.
{89703}{89727}why ?
{89756}{89774}Why you busy ?
{89774}{89798}I just can't.
{89924}{89989}If the drop on the left here,|beats the drop on the right

{91991}{92028}then stop fucking his wife.
{92028}{92052}Maybe that will help.

{92434}{92450}here !
{92578}{92617}I got you a taco.
{92651}{92673}where did you get that shit.
{92673}{92704}the only place that was open,|do you want it ?

{93569}{93626}- i don't know|- Mike...
{93650}{93691}Are you sure about the money being there?
{93691}{93737}what the fuck is wrong with you tonight ?
{93761}{93779}nothing, nothing.
{93966}{93997}i know a man that used to work for a loanshark.
{94058}{94076}So ?
{94077}{94138}He used to tell me the worst thing a gambler can do 
{94139}{94188}is borrow money from the loanshark.
{94189}{94243}loan shops are okay, but not loansharks.
{94243}{94334}Harry, borrowing money from a loanshark |and stealing money from a loanshark
{94334}{94358}are two different things.
{94358}{94403}It's still coming from a loanshark though, Mike.
{94566}{94592}It's better than cheating.
{94592}{94645}I'd never cheat, never.
{94645}{94721}Gamblers who cheat are more interested in money than gambling.
{94721}{94757}What's money ?
{94855}{94878}I don't gamble to make money.
{94902}{94925}No shit.
{95575}{95636}You think that's fucking funny ?
{95636}{95683}Hell yes, i think that's funny.
{95683}{95714}That's damn funny.
{95714}{95761}What's wrong with you anyway ?
{95761}{95832}Somebody a little testy today ?
{95832}{95871}Not in the mood for you funny shit that's all.
{95904}{95973}Oh, I see what it actually is.
{95973}{96062}It's a case of a little testy.
{96062}{96101}You want a fucking piece, motherfucker ?
{96205}{96236}- You can't take a hit ?|- Knock it off!
{96281}{96310}What the hell is going on right here, guys ?
{96310}{96327}Is the heat getting to you ?
{96351}{96395}I am talking on the goddamn phone.
{96419}{96441}Keep this shit out.
{96480}{96500}Detective Shuster.
{96535}{96612}Katie, no, we already told them once.
{96657}{96736}Listen to me, do what i say, just take care of it!
{96793}{96828}What are you looking at ?
{96877}{96901}Take it easy, Fred.
{96994}{97010}Has anybody seen my lighter ?
{97060}{97080}No.
{97208}{97229}God damn it!

{97363}{97382}Did you steal it ?
{97382}{97446}- did you take it ?|- No, i didn't steal your fucking lighter.
{97458}{97470}Son of a bitch.
{97501}{97558}it's the only thing my dad gave me.|it's my lucky piece.
{97558}{97604}Why would i steal your father's lighter.
{97604}{97648}Because you are a sadistic fuck, that's why!
{97672}{97684}Fine.
{97747}{97768}this is not good.
{97795}{97815}Not good.
{97930}{97963}I need some air.
{97963}{97987}Where ?
{97987}{98026}it's fucking Phoenix, there is no air.
{98110}{98140}John, you got some matches ?
{98176}{98191}Here you go.
{98191}{98215}Thanks.
{98851}{98874}Hi.

{99623}{99722}And i just wanted to have something of yours for luck.
{99750}{99784}I wouldn't know what good luck looks like.
{99815}{99849}It's really important to me.
{99895}{99926}what do you want it for, Harry ?
{99943}{99979}It doesn't matter.
{100025}{100065}why ask me, why not somebody else ?
{100181}{100199}Because i like you.
{100262}{100294}And i just wanted to come from you.
{100367}{100389}You're a gambler.
{100389}{100436}You wanna change your luck.
{100436}{100527}Get yourself sucked out of whatever this shit you got yourself into.
{100576}{100615}Just don't gamble with me.
{100646}{100661}I won't.
{101184}{101208}can i have those matches ?
