1
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,914
<i>Somebody told me</i>

2
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,255
<i>About an endless journey</i>

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,658
<i>And I can say</i>

4
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:33,529
<i>I feel it clearly now</i>

5
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,296
<i>He spoke to me</i>

6
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,804
<i>Of lightness, grace and glory</i>

7
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,101
<i>And I can see</i>

8
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,666
<i>I feel it clearly now</i>

9
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,043
<i>I can say</i>

10
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,945
<i>He touched my soul and</i>

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,779
<i>I know now</i>

12
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,048
<i>I'll take the walking slow</i>

13
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,282
<i>Movin'on and on</i>

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,759
<i>- What did you hear
- Oh, the sweetest sound</i>

15
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,729
<i>We had a tree
in our yard with a palace in the branches.</i>

16
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,732
<i>It was built for my sister...</i>

17
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,894
<i>and it had fairy lights
that went on and off in a sequence.</i>

18
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,572
<i>She was the princess.</i>

19
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,905
<i>It was her tree.
She wouldn't let me up it.</i>

20
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,876
<i>At night their darkness frightens me.</i>

21
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:28,818
<i>Someone could be watching from behind them-
someone who wishes you harm.</i>

22
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,119
<i>I used to imagine
the roots of that tree crawling-</i>

23
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,127
<i>crawling right under the house...</i>

24
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,197
<i>right under my bed.</i>

25
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,797
<i>Maybe that's why trees scare me.</i>

26
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,939
<i>It's like they have hidden powers.</i>

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,304
<i>Hey, hey, hey, come, come</i>

28
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,673
<i>It was so, so, so soon</i>

29
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,769
<i>Hey, hey, hey, come, come</i>

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,576
<i>It was so, so, so soon</i>

31
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,049
<i>Hey, hey, hey, come, come</i>

32
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,518
<i>It was so, so, so soon</i>

33
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,819
<i>Hey, hey, hey, come, come</i>

34
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,758
<i>Hey, hey, hey, come, come</i>

35
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,228
<i>It was so, so, so soon</i>

36
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,027
<i>There was darkness all around</i>

37
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,931
<i>But I did not feel a thing</i>

38
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,765
<i>Yes, I saw him smilin'true</i>

39
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,499
<i>The sword plows on through</i>

40
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,974
<i>Although darkness tempted me</i>

41
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,706
<i>That's when I reached out to you</i>

42
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,647
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

43
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,382
<i>Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

44
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,021
<i>All right. Let's have a look then, shall we?</i>

45
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,294
Mmm.
There is a man.

46
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,341
He's going to be important.

47
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,812
He's... offering a deep love.

48
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,512
<i>Yes. It's special.</i>

49
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,744
<i>Oh.</i>

50
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,185
What's that?

51
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,189
A question mark.

52
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,260
<i>Excuse me.</i>

53
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,093
<i>Hello?</i>

54
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,463
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

55
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,368
<i>Oh, my dear, no.</i>

56
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,929
No. No.

57
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,943
<i>Teddy. Please, Teddy.</i>

58
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,774
Please?

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,007
Thank you.

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,179
Oh, yes.
It's on his face.

61
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,256
There's a question mark
on his face, dear.

62
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,155
<i>- Question mark?
- Yes.</i>

63
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,468
Question mark?

64
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,477
Why didn't you tell me?

65
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,479
Ohh!

66
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,244
- Is that a sapphire?
- No, it's a diamond, silly.

67
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,810
- Lovely!
- That's wonderful. Congratulations.

68
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,890
- When's the wedding?
- Soon.

69
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,817
Kay, have you seen Cheryl's diamond?

70
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,362
It's not my kind of thing.

71
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,989
Not till you're asked. Eh, Kay?

72
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,442
She believes in serial monogamy.

73
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:11,275
So, uh, you believe
in serial monogamy, Kay?

74
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,277
Silly.

75
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,506
Maybe.

76
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,583
Well, what does that mean?

77
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,380
It just means maybe.

78
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,766
<i>Oh, God.</i>

79
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,835
<i>Question mark.</i>

80
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,242
<i>Lou, you're staring.</i>

81
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:02,989
Kay.

82
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,989
<i>I don't know what I'm doing down here,
but if Cheryl or anyone else sees me-</i>

83
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,936
<i>I know.
I'm as surprised as you are.</i>

84
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,770
It's just, well,
I'm destined to be with you.

85
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,203
That's a bit theatrical, isn't it?

86
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,579
Look, I wouldn't bother you,
but I think it's true.

87
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,709
It's in the spirits.

88
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,719
<i>Kay.</i>

89
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,451
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but really, no.

90
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,051
<i>I've been engaged to Cheryl
for, what, 55 minutes.</i>

91
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,292
Toss. Toss a coin.

92
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,372
<i>- For what?
- For keeps.</i>

93
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,838
All right.

94
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,915
<i>But they have to be tails, all five.</i>

95
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,826
<i>Tails.</i>

96
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,275
Why didn't you tell me this before?

97
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,850
<i>- Tails.
- Anyway, this doesn't matter.</i>

98
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,514
Because I'm in love with Cheryl.

99
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,623
<i>I'm on the right road</i>

100
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,630
<i>I'm on the right road</i>

101
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:50,532
<i>I'm on the right road to glory</i>

102
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,833
<i>I'm on the right road</i>

103
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,840
<i>I'm on the right road</i>

104
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,967
<i>Mended my soul</i>

105
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:02,673
<i>And now I stand upon</i>

106
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,340
<i>The right road</i>

107
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,884
<i>To glory, glory</i>

108
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,079
<i>- Hallelu-
- Oh, shit!</i>

109
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,250
Well, look in the park.

110
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,763
Hey, look!

111
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,795
Well, pick 'em up.
I'm not proud.

112
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,743
You know, I feel all...

113
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,820
sexy.

114
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,090
Yeah.

115
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,291
<i>Love</i>

116
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,728
<i>Love will never, never</i>

117
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:57,235
<i>Never</i>

118
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,567
<i>Let you fall</i>

119
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,641
Kay?

120
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,302
<i>Love</i>

121
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,972
<i>Love will never, never, never</i>

122
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,982
<i>Later I told him about the question mark...</i>

123
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,780
<i>and how we were meant to be.</i>

124
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,481
<i>He understood.</i>

125
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,582
<i>He'd worked out
that there were seven spiritual planes...</i>

126
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,652
<i>and the kind of love we had
was somewhere near the top.</i>

127
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:33,763
<i>Love will never, never, never</i>

128
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:41,041
<i>Let you fall</i>

129
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,744
- Clayton?
- They're taking your hoistie!

130
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,821
Him and another man.

131
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,461
Ah. Hi, Kay.

132
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,463
Lou, what -

133
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,830
- See?
- Hello, Simboo.

134
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,835
What are you doing?

135
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,064
I'm putting in a baby alder.

136
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,633
- That?
- Yeah.

137
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,812
I'm planting it for us.

138
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:18,043
Lou, this tree's got yellow leaves.
What does that mean?

139
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,313
That's okay.
It's just a mineral deficiency.

140
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,481
- A mineral deficiency?
- Once we put it in, it'll recover.

141
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,022
Well, where will I dry the washing?

142
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,222
Come on, Kay.

143
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,822
It'll be lovely-
our anniversary tree.

144
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,835
What about the roots, Lou?
They spread in under the house.

145
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,337
That kind of damage costs a fortune.

146
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,339
Kay!

147
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,841
Let's not do it.

148
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,845
I don't want this tree.
It's yellow and sick.

149
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,849
Jesus!

150
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,584
See ya.

151
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,055
Uh, it's a good tree, Kay.

152
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,558
That yellow, it's nothing.

153
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,002
<i>It was so, so, so soon</i>

154
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,733
<i>It was so, so, so soon</i>

155
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,332
<i>Hey, hey, hey, come, come</i>

156
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,878
<i>It was so, so, so soon</i>

157
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,073
<i>Hey, hey, hey, come, come</i>

158
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,751
What if it does die?

159
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,757
<i>What?</i>

160
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,827
<i>The tree.</i>

161
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,229
<i>Well, we'll get another one.</i>

162
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,233
<i>Yeah, but this one's our tree.</i>

163
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:47,135
Look, it's not gonna die.

164
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,730
The roots grow to be really strong.

165
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,810
They can split concrete.

166
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,084
Kay!

167
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,229
Kay!

168
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,958
<i>Wanna buy one of me cars?</i>

169
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,336
<i>Kay!</i>

170
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,368
Do you wanna buy a car?

171
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,378
- I don't want a car, Clayton.
- Just one.

172
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,778
<i>No, I don't want any.</i>

173
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,942
Please!

174
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,883
I've gotta go.

175
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,806
Where did you sleep?

176
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,808
In the other room.

177
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,810
- Why there?
- Shh!

178
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,743
Louis!

179
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,815
<i>Are you there?</i>

180
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,253
<i>Come on!</i>

181
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,323
<i>Louis!</i>

182
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,159
Couldn't sleep.

183
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,229
I've got a cold.

184
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,796
Germs.

185
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,874
Oh, yeah.

186
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,710
What's he doing?

187
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,408
Shh. He's meditating.

188
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,254
What for?

189
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,983
<i>Become aware of your breath.</i>

190
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,571
Thunder.
He's a wild one.

191
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,146
This is Blaze.

192
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,216
He used to be my favorite.

193
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,987
This is Blaze's mother, Gypsy.

194
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,292
That's her foal, Pride.

195
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,498
This one's Socks.

196
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,668
See?

197
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,135
Who done that?

198
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,474
My sister.

199
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,548
That's Broken Heart.

200
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,548
<i>- Kay?
- Yeah?</i>

201
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,552
Thunder! Thunder! Giddyap!

202
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,417
Our tree's gone.

203
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,854
That's strange.

204
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,589
Yeah.

205
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,257
<i>Got it looking nice.</i>

206
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,467
It's just temporary.

207
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,707
Thunder!

208
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,542
<i>I don't know why...</i>

209
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,276
<i>but even when my cold went...</i>

210
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,945
<i>I couldn't move back.</i>

211
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,023
<i>I just stayed on
in the spare room.</i>

212
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,504
Well, good night.

213
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,609
Good night, big sister.

214
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,680
Don't call me that.
I'm your girlfriend.

215
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,684
All right then.

216
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,926
<i>Love</i>

217
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,861
<i>Love will never, never</i>

218
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:50,298
<i>Never</i>

219
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,066
<i>Let you fall</i>

220
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,317
Excuse me.

221
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,686
I don't feel anything.

222
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,259
Okay. Good.

223
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,260
Take a seat.

224
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,728
Gently close the eyes.

225
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,967
It just makes me irritable.

226
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,384
Yes. Good.

227
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,879
Gently...

228
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,785
<i>close the eyes.</i>

229
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,723
But it's not working.

230
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,397
Yes.

231
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,468
Good.

232
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,059
<i>Just gently...</i>

233
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,273
<i>close the eyes.</i>

234
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,404
Gently...

235
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,276
close the eyes.

236
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,512
Well, it won't work.
I won't feel any quiet.

237
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:24,652
<i>Oh, dear. They are dirty.
What have you been doing?</i>

238
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,027
<i>- Making mud pies.
- Our minds...</i>

239
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,533
<i>begin to slow down.</i>

240
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:38,342
<i>Now we begin to find some quiet.</i>

241
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,861
There you are.

242
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,863
Oh, hi, Melony.

243
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,594
- Hmm. How was your class?
- About eight turned up.

244
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,500
That's all right.
That's good.

245
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,404
Hmm.

246
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,568
Anyway, I found that book
I was talking about.

247
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,771
Oh, yeah? What was that?

248
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,981
The tantric book. Mmm.

249
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,176
<i>- Oh, right.
- Mmm.</i>

250
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,380
<i>Mmm.</i>

251
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,788
<i>Somewhere. Somewhere it says.</i>

252
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,157
Yeah. Here it is.

253
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,700
<i>Melony, you did all of this?</i>

254
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,107
I've done some of it.

255
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,404
Mmm. Mmm.

256
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,482
It's pretty involved stuff.

257
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,178
<i>- Mmm. Yes.
- Lou, are you ready?</i>

258
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,457
Oh. Kay.

259
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,826
<i>- How was it?
- Hi, Kay.</i>

260
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,022
You look beautiful.

261
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,100
You know, I think it's great
that you're doing this.

262
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,328
<i>- Mmm.
- Thanks.</i>

263
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,666
I'll wait outside.

264
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,783
<i>Melony is such a bitch.</i>

265
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:30,184
<i>I couldn't believe
he was talking to her.</i>

266
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,594
What was that book
you were looking at?

267
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,665
Just a meditation book.

268
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,071
What's the matter?

269
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,145
Nothing.

270
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,841
Kay. Kay!

271
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,343
<i>Oh, God. Look who's here.</i>

272
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,880
<i>- What a nerve.
- Can you believe he's here?</i>

273
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,006
What's he doing here?

274
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,245
What, did she ask him in
or something, did she?

275
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,254
- Bitch.
- Great.

276
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,324
Oh, charming.

277
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,160
<i>Piss off, dickhead.</i>

278
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,061
- Did you see what's he's wearing?
- Doesn't know what he's doing.

279
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,231
<i>Things aren't going well, are they?</i>

280
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,640
<i>- I thought you wanted it like this.
- No.</i>

281
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,213
No, I don't.
I'm not happy.

282
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,282
Nor am I.

283
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,247
<i>I read somewhere once that when
the other side of things breaks down...</i>

284
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,812
one thing you can do is make
an appointment with each other for sex.

285
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,260
<i>Do you wanna try?</i>

286
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,666
All right.

287
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,769
Tonight?

288
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,004
It's weird.

289
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,006
Yeah, I know.

290
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,008
Well...

291
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,010
bye.

292
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,146
<i>Love</i>

293
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,851
<i>Love will never, never</i>

294
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:52,020
<i>Never</i>

295
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,363
<i>Let you fall</i>

296
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,233
<i>Love</i>

297
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,966
<i>Love will never, never</i>

298
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:07,033
<i>Never</i>

299
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:13,778
<i>Let you fall</i>

300
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,156
Don't you want to?

301
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,719
I don't know.

302
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,729
Do you?

303
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,233
Feels like you're my brother
or something.

304
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,202
Yeah. Incest.

305
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:50,270
Look, we just have to relax
and things will go back to normal.

306
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:56,109
Some animals
won't mate in captivity.

307
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,349
Like pandas.
They don't.

308
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,051
What happens?

309
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,288
Uh, I think they get depressed.

310
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:13,167
You know, I think we're just going
through a non-sex phase, that's all.

311
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,735
It's probably more spiritual like this.

312
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:30,817
I mean,
the Dalai Lama doesn't do it.

313
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,890
Yeah.

314
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:39,458
You know, I've really been seriously thinking
about getting all this cut off.

315
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,259
Chop?

316
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,096
<i>There's a light on, Lou.</i>

317
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,139
<i>Fuck!
Someone's broken the window!</i>

318
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,579
<i>Kay, they could still be in there.</i>

319
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,365
<i>Oh, God. No! Look!</i>

320
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,871
Oh. It's all right.

321
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,873
<i>- Kay?
- Yeah?</i>

322
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,034
It's a friend of mine.

323
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,044
What, she broke in?

324
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,944
Yeah, she's a bit -
a bit mental.

325
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,517
There's someone with her.

326
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,586
I'll handle this. Okay?

327
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,922
I'm coming in.

328
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,753
<i>Surprise!</i>

329
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,226
What are you doing here?
You know you're not allowed.

330
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,594
<i>You broke the bloody window.
I'm really mad at you.</i>

331
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,327
It wouldn't open, Kay.
It was really stiff.

332
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,336
Of course it was.
It was locked.

333
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:57,067
<i>Yeah, well,
I couldn't get it to open.</i>

334
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,134
Hi. Sweetie says
that you're a really nice lady.

335
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,678
- Who's he?
- My producer.

336
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,446
Bob, meet Kay.
Kay, Bob.

337
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,714
You've stopped taking
your medication, haven't you?

338
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:14,223
Yeah, well, Bob and I are really gonna
walk through some doors, Kay.

339
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,384
We're really getting it together.

340
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,394
Tell him to take off Louis's jacket.

341
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,599
<i>You can't stay.
You know that.</i>

342
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,601
Oh, yeah? Well, if it wasn't so late,
we'd go, you know.

343
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,230
But I just wanted to see you
and say "Hi there!"

344
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,432
<i>Oh, no! You didn't!</i>

345
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,443
<i>What is this stuff?
Some Mexican weed?</i>

346
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,672
No!

347
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,180
<i>Why was it in the wardrobe?</i>

348
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:42,242
Just forget about this plant, all right?
It's just a tree. A little tree.

349
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,254
<i>I don't want you to mention it.
All right?</i>

350
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,483
- Yeah. Oh, okay.
- Okay.

351
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,119
- But why was it in the war-
- Shut up about it, all right?

352
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,629
Okay.
Okay, Bob?

353
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,200
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay, Kay.

354
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:03,630
<i>- Got any more of those things
we were sucking on?</i>

355
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,237
Hi!

356
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,837
- Hello.
- Hey. Do you wanna watch me swim?

357
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,486
Okay.

358
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,986
<i>I'm in my birthday pool!</i>

359
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,168
Hi.

360
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,179
Have they gone?

361
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,181
They're next door.

362
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,016
What are they doing there?

363
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,215
<i>She's your sister.</i>

364
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,460
Is that right?

365
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,529
Kay?

366
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,191
She was just...

367
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,393
born.

368
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,561
I don't have anything to do with her.

369
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,910
What are you doing, Dawn?

370
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,246
Having a relax.

371
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,747
You're supposed to have gone.

372
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,750
Bob was feeling sick, Kay.

373
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,082
There's not just me to think of.

374
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,190
<i>Hey, Kay!</i>

375
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,760
<i>Does she have a princess castle?</i>

376
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,691
With lights?

377
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:38,424
- Up a tree?
- Yes, she does.

378
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,597
You be Thunder, Bob!

379
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,544
Watch, Kay!

380
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,813
Come on, Bob!
Giddyap! Giddyap!

381
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,406
<i>Why are you so tough on her?</i>

382
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,078
<i>She's okay.
She was fine today.</i>

383
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,917
Oh, yeah? You wait.

384
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,923
She's a dark spirit.

385
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,654
Oh, come on, Kay. She's had bad luck,
being in a coma for a year.

386
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:06,889
Jesus, it's no wonder
she's not normal.

387
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,898
Is that what she told you?

388
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,093
She's never been in a coma.

389
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,534
She's never even been unconscious.

390
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,607
<i>Yee-hah! Yee-hah! Come on, Bob!</i>

391
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,068
<i>- Go for it.
- Yeah, we're really gonna go for it.</i>

392
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,807
- Just go for it.
- Yeah. Tomorrow.

393
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,816
- We're just gonna go for it.
- Really go for it.

394
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,818
And we're gonna get up early.

395
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,820
- 11:00.
- Yeah.

396
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,913
- Go for it.
- And then -

397
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,993
- Do you think we should go into town?
- Mmm.

398
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,271
You awake?

399
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,341
Yeah. Why?

400
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,409
<i>I'm missing you.</i>

401
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,479
Why don't you move back?

402
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:00,339
<i>- You can bring your bed.
- I miss you too.</i>

403
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,978
But I can't move back now.
She'd think it was spare.

404
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:20,493
I hope she's still got her coil in.
They've been at it a fair bit.

405
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,335
Yeah.
I suppose they've just met.

406
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,841
<i>And again, Bob.</i>

407
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,845
Wouldn't mind getting through
to the toilet someday.

408
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,415
<i>Yeah, actually-</i>

409
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,733
Lou, you've got a hard-on.

410
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,636
Yeah. I know.

411
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,104
Right.
I'm telling them to stop.

412
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,180
No.
No, don't do that.

413
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,282
Dawn, can you finish?

414
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,353
We want to get to the bathroom.

415
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,627
Come on, then.

416
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,640
Done your wee-wees?

417
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,029
Yay! Our turn! Our turn! Our turn!

418
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,031
Come on, Bob!

419
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,033
Go, Bob!

420
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:01,231
- Yay! Ball's over!
- You're supposed to run with it!

421
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,211
- Right.
- Are you ready, Sweetie?

422
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,747
Aah! Louis!

423
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,340
- Louis!
- Go, Sweetie!

424
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,114
- Bob.
- That wasn't fair.

425
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,389
I'm lonely.

426
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,826
Bob's asleep.

427
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,428
Aren't you and Kay on together?

428
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,502
Yes.

429
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,672
Then why don't you sleep
in the same room?

430
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,334
Kay has a cold.

431
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,411
Oh. A cold.

432
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,684
Have you ever been licked all over?

433
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,686
I'm a good licker.

434
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,688
I licked Bob last night.

435
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,758
Even between his toes.

436
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,754
I could show you what it feels like
on your fingers.

437
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,230
It's okay. No charge.

438
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,771
- Thank you.
- I could go on up your arm.

439
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,773
No, thanks, Sweetie.

440
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,070
Or I could show you
a goanna kiss on your bottom.

441
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,145
Oh, no, thank you. Honestly.

442
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,108
You're nice, Louis.

443
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,184
Your face is nice.

444
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,789
I like it.

445
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,159
It's nice.

446
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,763
Ohh.

447
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,272
You okay, Bob?

448
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,509
He's okay.

449
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,593
<i>What is it?</i>

450
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,470
- Ha!
- Like knows like.

451
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,006
Ah, like two little orphans.

452
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,804
Oh, look at this.
She's taking its little arms off!

453
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,279
Did you like that?

454
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:10,411
God! I thought a big snail
was sliding up my nightie.

455
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:16,450
Feels cold and wet.

456
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,460
And?

457
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,894
What?

458
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,795
Can I keep doing it?

459
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,993
Why?

460
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,573
Louis!

461
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,959
Oh, shit!

462
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,970
<i>Sweetie!</i>

463
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,513
- So, what are these?
- Hi, Kay.

464
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,587
Dawn!

465
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,724
I don't know.

466
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,692
Sleeves!

467
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,820
- But not your sleeves.
- All right.

468
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,365
They've been quite useful, Kay.

469
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,662
Well, where's the rest of it?

470
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,562
- Where's the rest of it?
- It's outside drying.

471
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,542
Kay, Sweetie's done something
she shouldn't have done.

472
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,545
And, well, we've already talked about it
and I think she understands it was wrong.

473
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,615
<i>Oh, shut up!</i>

474
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,360
Oh, fuck.

475
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,596
<i>- That's it.
- I've told her-</i>

476
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,136
<i>This isn't the first time. She's been
treating my things like this all her life.</i>

477
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,137
Get up! Go on!
You're going right now!

478
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,139
- That's just it!
- I'm getting upset.

479
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,641
<i>- This is ridiculous.
- I'm gonna do something.</i>

480
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,439
<i>- I'm really gonna do something!
- I don't care! Just get out!</i>

481
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,674
- I'm not going! I'm not going!
- Boy, she really means it.

482
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,877
- You're going, Dawn!
- No, I'm not going!

483
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,285
- I'm not going!
- We're not giving you anything else!

484
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,584
I've really had it with you!

485
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:31,388
- She's gonna hurt me, Louis! Don't let her!
- Kay, she's gonna go. Aren't you, Sweetie?

486
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,554
Get going!

487
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,030
Right! That's it!

488
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,431
You really asked for it!

489
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,697
I'm gonna do something now.

490
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,700
I'm sorry I got mad.

491
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,238
<i>It's just that
I'm not used to having-</i>

492
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,476
Jesus, Sweetie!

493
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,739
<i>You'd better not have damaged them.</i>

494
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,815
<i>Spit them out. Now!</i>

495
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,849
Aaah!

496
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,181
Oh, you bitch! You fucking bitch!

497
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:32,449
Give them back!

498
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,717
Oh, you - Oh, you cow!

499
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,419
Kay! Stop! Don't.

500
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,258
<i>She might choke.</i>

501
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,026
- Ohh!
- Jesus, Sweetie.

502
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,836
Here. Cough it up.

503
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,774
<i>Come on. It's all right.
Kay's not mad anymore.</i>

504
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,141
- Spit it out. It's okay.
- Cough it up!

505
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,612
It's okay.

506
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,615
Go on.

507
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,776
<i>You better go.</i>

508
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,950
Gordon, I'm not gonna
be made to feel guilty.

509
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,816
Look at Eddie and Majella.
They were like us.

510
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,721
Drifting along for years
making a mess of things.

511
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,259
Anyway, it's just a trial.

512
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,261
A month apart.

513
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,331
Gordon?

514
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:27,098
<i>Gordon?</i>

515
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,134
<i>I'm leaving, dear.</i>

516
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,447
The plates are cooling.

517
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,518
All you need to do
is pop 'em in the freezer.

518
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,219
<i>Dawn.</i>

519
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,123
<i>Dawn!</i>

520
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,158
All right!

521
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,895
- Dad.
- Can I come in?

522
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,905
I'm getting on real well, Dad.

523
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,669
Well, that's great.
That's terrific.

524
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,745
Can I come in?

525
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,789
Who is it?

526
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,859
Dad.

527
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,424
Dad, what are you doing?

528
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,897
- I'm not going back.
- That's all right.

529
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,901
<i>I'm making it, Dad.
I'm walking through doors.</i>

530
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,903
This time I'm doing it, eh?

531
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,633
- That's good, Dawn.
- Where's Mum?

532
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,642
"One moment, please, sir,
and I'll check on that."

533
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,645
Remember that, Dad? " One moment,
please, sir, and I'll check on that."

534
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,647
I remember it, all right.

535
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,480
- I've got a producer this time.
- Well, that's good, Dawn.

536
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:25,749
Uh, can you put these
in the freezer, Kay?

537
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,017
We don't have a freezer, Dad.

538
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,026
What, no freezer?
Jesus!

539
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,722
Would you like to be
introduced to Bob, Dad?

540
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,800
Uh, later, Dawn.

541
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,868
No freezer?

542
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,505
Well, I suppose we'd better eat 'em.
There's a couple of Tuesdays.

543
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,373
Dad, what's gone wrong?

544
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,209
Oh, your mother's left me.

545
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,909
I can't talk about it.

546
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,917
I get bad.

547
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,510
There's a Saturday and...

548
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,522
three Wednesdays.

549
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,956
Boy.

550
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,858
So, uh, Sweetie's doing all right, eh?

551
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,296
<i>- Are you kidding?
- Oh, give her a go, Kay.</i>

552
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,493
<i>This could be
what we've been looking for for her.</i>

553
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,536
Come and meet my producer.

554
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,136
Come on!

555
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,218
Shh.

556
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,311
He's asleep.

557
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,726
He believes in me...

558
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,959
and I believe in him.

559
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,876
<i>She's gotta go, Dad. Him too.</i>

560
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,648
<i>- I can't have them here anymore.
- It is a bit hard, Gordon.</i>

561
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,815
I'm trying to run a business
from the house.

562
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:11,088
Get rid of Bob first.
Then it'll be easier.

563
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,322
<i>Take him to a restaurant
or something...</i>

564
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,888
<i>and afterwards
jump in a cab by yourself.</i>

565
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,763
Oh, no.

566
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,667
<i>- I just thought of something.
- Yeah?</i>

567
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:25,105
The suit.
We've gotta get him out of your suit.

568
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,643
Forget the suit.

569
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,905
Lou, your T.M. suit!

570
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,914
<i>I thought I brought you kids up
to love each other.</i>

571
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:39,387
It's a bit hard
when she's in fairyland.

572
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,390
"One moment, please, sir,
and I'll check on that."

573
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:46,588
My God, if I hear her say that line one more time,
I'll tear her throat out.

574
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,257
<i>I can't understand what's happening.</i>

575
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,563
<i>The whole family's coming apart
like a wet paper bag.</i>

576
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:55,331
People like you two
don't appreciate this...

577
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:58,602
but the show world
is full of unusual types.

578
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,405
What's to say Sweetie's
any more unusual?

579
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:05,914
She's talented.
She's sincerely talented.

580
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,883
<i>You never did appreciate her, Kay.</i>

581
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:12,285
But this Bob fella
could be her break.

582
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,017
<i>Gee, she was a talented little thing.</i>

583
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,561
<i>Sing, dance, tap, act the goat.</i>

584
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,960
<i>Anything she put her mind to.</i>

585
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,749
<i>What, shall we sit here?</i>

586
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,393
Nice place, Bob.
Very interesting.

587
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,464
Yeah, it's a good place.

588
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:59,264
Oh, look, I fucking had you, mate.
Why don't you just piss off.

589
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,599
I'm not serving you.
That's fuckin' it. No.

590
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:04,299
<i>This is good custom, Mandy.</i>

591
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:07,309
This is, um, uh -Yeah.

592
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,311
He's paying.

593
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,711
<i>- Show her your wallet or something like -
- What?</i>

594
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:13,783
Show her me wallet?

595
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,844
Young lady, I can assure you
I am quite financial.

596
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,923
I'll just have a coffee.

597
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,458
<i>That's good work.
You showed her.</i>

598
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,961
<i>Look, uh, Bob...</i>

599
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,196
<i>I- I'm going to be straight with you.</i>

600
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,534
I think it's only fair.

601
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,200
I don't know
what Dawnee's told you...

602
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:43,643
<i>but the truth is that she's never actually
held a position in the entertainment field.</i>

603
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,738
But she really wants to.

604
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:49,250
<i>- That's the main thing, eh?
- Uh, it's important.</i>

605
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,821
Eh, she's not a total no one.

606
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:55,517
<i>Oh, no.
She's a very talented young lady.</i>

607
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,093
Too talented, emotional, creative.

608
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:01,323
<i>What'll you have, sir?</i>

609
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:04,093
What should I have here, Bob?

610
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,169
<i>What's good here?</i>

611
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,164
Uh -

612
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:14,573
- Oh -
- As a kid, she was so good...

613
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,306
the teachers
would have had her for nothing.

614
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:21,350
<i>My wife thought I put her on a pedestal,
but you had to.</i>

615
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,351
I can remember her this high.

616
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,445
She used to line all the kitchen chairs
out on the lawn...

617
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:28,786
<i>and flick 'em over just like Fred,
only better.</i>

618
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,522
What I'm trying to say, Bob -

619
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,791
and it's hard for me to say it -

620
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:39,733
<i>is... has she got a chance?</i>

621
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,806
Bob?

622
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,976
<i>Bob.</i>

623
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,701
Dad, Mum rang last night.

624
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:53,173
She wants me and Louis
to go and visit her out west.

625
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:59,510
You know what she's doing?
She's got a job cooking for some jackeroos.

626
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:04,452
<i>She knows you're here.</i>

627
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,817
So she doesn't want to see me.

628
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,018
Not even interested in the old bugger.

629
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,619
Dad, she didn't say that.

630
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,198
<i>Sounds to me like she did.</i>

631
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,200
<i>There's a big drum in here says she did.</i>

632
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,767
Like her damn fists are inside,
beating me up.

633
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,720
- What are you up to, Gordon?
- Cleaning the car.

634
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,851
Yeah? What for?

635
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,361
<i>- Out west.
- Oh.</i>

636
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,364
<i>How you going?</i>

637
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,129
She's missing young Bob, eh?

638
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,865
- Show Louis your chair trick.
- Shut up.

639
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,414
Lou. Okay. I'll show you.

640
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,484
Get the chair.

641
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,380
Turn it round a bit.

642
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,534
She used to flip 'em over herself.

643
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,577
Louis.

644
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,654
Watch me.

645
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,691
Louis.

646
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:18,120
Oh.

647
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,416
- I thought she wasn't coming. What's she doing out there?
- I know.

648
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,257
<i>I'll go out and talk to her.</i>

649
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:40,093
Sweetie, I'm afraid
you can't come this time.

650
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:45,106
<i>I want you to stay
and hold the fort for Dad.</i>

651
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,142
Okay?

652
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,442
Come on, princess.

653
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,942
You're Dad's real girl.
You know that, don't ya?

654
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,684
Come on. Out you come.

655
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,267
She's so bloody cunning.

656
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,936
Well, she's gotta get out sometime.

657
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,275
Even if it's just to go to the toilet.

658
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:30,443
<i>I like that there. I don't like the grass growing
round and competing with the roots of the citrus.</i>

659
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,284
<i>Particularly with an old tree like that.
Uh, you-</i>

660
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,836
Oh, God.

661
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,716
Oh!

662
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,748
All right. Everyone in the car.

663
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,928
<i>Is that the phone?</i>

664
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,762
<i>- Can you get it?
- I'll run back.</i>

665
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,910
I'll go and get her.

666
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,344
Sweetie, telephone.

667
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,474
<i>It's Bob, Sweetie.</i>

668
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:38,043
<i>See? I told you he'd ring, didn't I?</i>

669
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,789
Bob.

670
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,791
What's he want?

671
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:48,159
Well, he said something about an audition.
He sounds excited.

672
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,534
He's waiting, darling.

673
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,604
He won't wait forever.

674
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,968
Why'd he have to ring now for?

675
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:00,975
Well, he has.

676
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:04,569
But if you're not interested,
I'll go and tell him.

677
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:08,708
- Is he tricking me?
- I can't keep Bob waiting.

678
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,923
Lou, is it really Bob?

679
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:18,050
You'll have to go
and see for yourself, Sweetie.

680
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,265
Wait!

681
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:32,735
Come on.

682
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,379
Bob?

683
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,551
Bob.

684
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,557
Oh.

685
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,828
Oh.

686
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,869
Dad, what are you doing?

687
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:22,580
How long's this routine gonna last?

688
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:25,017
About an hour.

689
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,351
Is he worried about something?
Have I upset him?

690
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,425
No. He's meditating.

691
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,758
<i>Jesus. Look at the size of this fella.</i>

692
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,734
Come on, matey.
Off to work.

693
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,716
Is this it?

694
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,877
<i>They don't seem to be expecting us.</i>

695
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:01,445
<i>- Ask.
- Uh, hey.</i>

696
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,294
Maybe you should get out.

697
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,995
<i>This is good.
So great.</i>

698
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,536
I appreciate your coming all this way.

699
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,902
Yeah.

700
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,976
Well, I don't know how you feel
about Gordon being with us.

701
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:26,046
He was gonna wait in a nearby town,
but there just wasn't anything nearby.

702
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,676
- There's a bloke in there.
- Oh, yeah?

703
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:34,450
Gordon, Kay.

704
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:37,025
Gonna come in
and join us all for a meal?

705
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,830
Gordon, please come in.

706
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:46,026
<i>You're very welcome.</i>

707
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,036
Come on, sweetheart.

708
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,461
<i>There's a love</i>

709
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,758
<i>That waits for you</i>

710
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,493
<i>And there's a love</i>

711
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:21,229
<i>That waits for me</i>

712
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,430
<i>It's a love</i>

713
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:26,337
<i>So good and true</i>

714
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,740
And I know

715
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:31,507
Will always be

716
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:36,551
- Let me hold you in my arms
- In my arms

717
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:41,715
- And you won't be sorry, dear
- Sorry, dear

718
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:44,418
- For I know
- Yes, I know that you're the one

719
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,757
That you're the one

720
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:52,130
You're the love that waits for me

721
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,203
<i>- So forget
- That's Mum.</i>

722
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:56,965
<i>About the heartache</i>

723
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:02,101
<i>And the troubles you've been through</i>

724
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,372
<i>- I didn't know she could sing.
- Somewhere</i>

725
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,711
<i>- Yeah. She's not bad.
- There's a someone</i>

726
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:13,687
For someone just like you

727
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,315
<i>There's a love</i>

728
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,893
<i>- That waits for you
- Night.</i>

729
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,225
<i>And there's a love</i>

730
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,163
<i>- That waits for me
- I hope Dad's all right.</i>

731
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:28,727
<i>It's a love so good and true</i>

732
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,773
I believe we can begin again.

733
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,641
Out here I can believe it.
But, well, you know -

734
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,647
I know. It's Sweetie.

735
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:41,717
She's had her way too long.

736
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:46,084
- Dad and I have a right to a life too.
- I know, Mum, but will she let you?

737
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:48,817
Well, what's been happening
isn't fair to her either.

738
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,825
All illusions.

739
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,896
<i>Yes, but illusions don't go away.</i>

740
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:59,593
They become more subtle.
I mean, what's real? It's a big question.

741
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:02,227
Not to me. Not now.

742
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,238
I feel like I know.

743
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,401
I hope so.
It's just that Dawn is so damn clever.

744
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,503
I really think she's evil.
I've told Louis that.

745
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,549
She's not evil.
She's just frightened.

746
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,983
What noise do crocodiles make, Louis?

747
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,091
Follow me, crocs.

748
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,322
Ooh.

749
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,663
It's lovely. Oh.

750
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:56,016
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

751
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,053
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

752
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,641
Can I have a turn?

753
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,606
Come on. It's lovely.

754
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,675
It's not my kind of music.

755
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,978
Come on. Please. For me?

756
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,575
<i>Car.</i>

757
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,857
<i>That's it. It's Jay.</i>

758
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,988
<i>- It's her father.
- No.</i>

759
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:11,896
<i>You can tell by the lights.</i>

760
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,922
May I?

761
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:45,000
Mm-hmm.

762
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:35,074
- Remember.
- Yeah. You still have to fix that fence.

763
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:38,348
That'll upset him no end.
Serves him right.

764
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,649
- Oh, that's right. Yeah.
- Shouldn't have gone off.

765
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,623
<i>- Hello, love.
- Hello, Dad.</i>

766
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,923
Gordie and I are just about to
start the breakfast.

767
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:50,430
Come on, Gordie. Let's get cookin'.
You do toast and tables.

768
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,694
- Have a good sleep?
- Yes, thanks.

769
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:06,745
So let me take you in my arms

770
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:10,910
- In my arms
- And you won't be sorry, dear

771
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,582
<i>- Sorry, dear
- For I know that you're the one</i>

772
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:20,253
<i>- You're the one
- You're the love that waits for me</i>

773
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,455
<i>Oh, I know</i>

774
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:25,762
What's the matter?

775
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,033
Are you all right?

776
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:36,972
I just want everybody to be together.

777
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,047
Oh, honey.

778
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,398
- Sweetie?
- Mmm.

779
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,904
He's in a fix about her.

780
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,670
One thing we decided,
she's not gonna live with us.

781
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,835
We're finding her
something nice close by.

782
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,311
That's good, Mum. That's really great.

783
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,247
Oh, I don't know.
I don't think he can do it.

784
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:18,849
Well, he must. It's for the best.

785
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:22,481
He's under her thumb.
Kay, look at him.

786
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:24,616
He's scared stiff.

787
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:47,572
Well, it doesn't look too bad.

788
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,651
Sweetie.

789
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,811
Hey, baby. You all right?

790
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,946
Sweetie.

791
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:56,320
You just left me.

792
01:09:56,425 --> 01:10:00,555
You're a big girl.
I left money for food.

793
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,790
I had to spend that, didn't I?

794
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,298
I had to buy a skirt.

795
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,733
Flo, she hasn't been eating.

796
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:12,705
We've been looking forward to seeing you, Sweetie.

797
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:17,108
<i>What's she doing? Dawn, what is it?</i>

798
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,909
<i>- Stop it, Dawn. Stop it now.
- Shush, Kay.</i>

799
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:25,746
Hello, little puppy.

800
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:30,791
Hello, little puppy.
Tell Daddy all you know. Come on now.

801
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:34,829
Come - Come on now. Little puppy.

802
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:40,633
I can't believe this.

803
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,671
If Dawn wants to be a dog,
that's fine by me.

804
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,003
No wonder you were left behind.

805
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:52,603
Pull yourself together.
We can't take you anywhere.

806
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,625
<i>- Ha, ha!
- You'll end up in a damn home.</i>

807
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:28,516
Flo...

808
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:33,184
have you, uh, seen my handstand?

809
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,424
No.

810
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:48,970
What a plain little yard.

811
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,438
I suppose that's the way
when you're renting.

812
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,501
I did put a tree in once.

813
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:59,672
<i>- Here. But someone stole it.
- Hmm.</i>

814
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,816
I can't imagine living without my trees.

815
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:05,853
They give me hope.

816
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:08,548
<i>How do you get that big?</i>

817
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,359
Have you told Sweetie about the unit?

818
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,832
Not yet.
When we're home and organized.

819
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:24,999
<i>- But you're still hopeful.
- Oh, yes. I'm not giving him up.</i>

820
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,268
Not without a struggle.

821
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,980
<i>Hers?</i>

822
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:35,277
Yeah.

823
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:38,376
Whee!

824
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,724
Dad!

825
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:24,065
Rubbish?

826
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,831
- How's it going?
- Oh, just about there.

827
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:32,464
It all looks like rubbish to me,
but knowin' Sweetie -

828
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,168
- I'll do that, Dad.
- No. Look. I'll do it.

829
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:38,178
Hey. Watch out. I'm here now.

830
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,348
<i>God. What's this?</i>

831
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,166
Hey, look, Kay.

832
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,336
Baby alder leaf.

833
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,641
<i>Like our tree was.</i>

834
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,709
What's the matter?

835
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,786
Nothing.

836
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:59,016
Its leaves were going yellow.

837
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,310
Oh!

838
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,477
It's the plant, isn't it?

839
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:06,183
Why don't you try meditating?

840
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,657
Can't you forget it?

841
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,735
Louis?

842
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:18,164
Why can't you just forget it?

843
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,437
I'm sorry.

844
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:27,606
I was worried the plant
would die, and it might...

845
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:31,174
you know, be an omen.

846
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,489
<i>I'm sorry. You know I am.</i>

847
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:38,860
It's not just the plant.

848
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:41,327
What?

849
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,364
It's not just the plant.

850
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:46,367
What else?

851
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:51,439
Louis, what?

852
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,599
Louis!

853
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:01,473
You've got to tell me.
It's not fair! What else?

854
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:07,517
What else, Louis?
Tell me what else!

855
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:12,649
Louis, please don't do this!
Talk to me, please!

856
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:15,922
What else then?

857
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:17,999
What else?

858
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,864
You're abnormal.

859
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:24,504
<i>You can't even let a little plant live.</i>

860
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,971
Where are you going?

861
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:37,351
Louis?

862
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:42,846
<i>- Can't we finish talking?
- Far</i>

863
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,892
<i>Louis?</i>

864
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:48,258
<i>Beyond</i>

865
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:51,127
<i>- Us
- Far beyond us</i>

866
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:53,667
- Louis.
- Go away!

867
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:57,136
<i>Far beyond us</i>

868
01:17:57,239 --> 01:18:01,437
<i>Closer</i>

869
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,839
<i>Than our own</i>

870
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:16,315
<i>- You better come in, dear.
- Breath</i>

871
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:27,429
<i>Don't mind Teddy. He's like this in the mornings.</i>

872
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:31,039
Now let's hold hands.

873
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:33,801
<i>Now, what is it?</i>

874
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:37,845
- My boyfriend left.
- Oh. What's wrong?

875
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:40,141
I thought you two were in love.

876
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,842
Are you having sex?

877
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:46,443
Not really. We're out of that phase.

878
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,819
Oh, no, dear.
You're never out of it.

879
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:52,189
We're all animals.
It doesn't pay to forget that.

880
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:55,195
There's nothing more loyal
than an animal.

881
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:57,288
Forget your mind.

882
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,299
Courage and sex.

883
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:04,338
<i>That's what love is.</i>

884
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,775
<i>Listen to Teddy.</i>

885
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:11,004
He won't know love.
Just the yearning.

886
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,013
He's sick with it.

887
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:16,116
I was wondering...

888
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:19,654
do you think you can get him
to come back with herbs or something?

889
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:24,124
Oh, no, dear. Not with herbs.

890
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,456
This is the best we can do.

891
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:30,861
<i>It's your voice, dear. It agitates him.</i>

892
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:42,709
Sweetie.

893
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:02,962
- Hello?
- Kay?

894
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:04,964
It's Mum.

895
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,500
It's Sweetie. She's up a tree.

896
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:09,729
We can't get her down.

897
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:14,074
<i>She says she wants
your little fella next door...</i>

898
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,908
to see her palace.

899
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:20,481
I mean, do you think it's worth a try?

900
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,712
Everything all right?

901
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,415
You okay?

902
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:30,491
I'm just sick of it, Mum.

903
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:35,256
Well, we don't want to
call the fire brigade until we have to.

904
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:42,031
<i>Where's my breakfast?</i>

905
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:45,038
<i>- Skinhead!
- Is this Sweetie's house?</i>

906
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,438
I was hoping you wouldn't come.

907
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:50,443
<i>- Where's Sweetie?
- You and Mum might skin me to death!</i>

908
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,173
<i>- She's gone, dear. She's gone away on a holiday.
- Where's my drink?</i>

909
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:57,445
- Can I play in her palace?
- It's too dangerous, Clayton. It's very high up.

910
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:00,316
I think she wants you to
play with her guinea pigs.

911
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:03,858
She's stripped herself nude,
covered herself in paint.

912
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:06,427
Dad still can't bring himself
to call anyone.

913
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,122
We can't have the little fella seeing it.

914
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:14,066
Gordon. They're here, Gordon.

915
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:16,797
Have you tried to reason with her?

916
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:19,373
Reason never worked with Dawn.
You know that.

917
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,339
I'm just sick of it, Mum.

918
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:25,675
<i>Come, you fucking bitch!</i>

919
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,680
<i>Where is everyone?</i>

920
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,909
Oh, no.

921
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,782
<i>You're all fucks!</i>

922
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,880
<i>- I told you.
- Cunts!</i>

923
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,917
<i>- G'day, mate.
- Dawn's gonna show you her guinea pigs.</i>

924
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:17,291
<i>Dad, you're an asshole, Dad!</i>

925
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:21,096
Gordon sends her meals up in a bucket.
She treats him like a dog.

926
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:23,261
<i>She's the master.</i>

927
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:26,238
<i>- Hello, Kay.
- How are things, Dad?</i>

928
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,468
Oh, pretty crook.

929
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:31,909
Kay said she saw the Pattersons
watching from over the fence.

930
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:33,981
Oh, good luck to 'em.

931
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:38,280
What'll we do, Dad?
We should call someone.

932
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,650
- Like who?
- The police.

933
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:44,452
- She's not doing anything illegal.
- She's stark naked, Dad.

934
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:47,858
What about the old folk over the back?
That's who I feel sorry for.

935
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,193
They shouldn't have to witness
this kind of thing.

936
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,233
<i>None of them have laid a complaint.</i>

937
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,860
<i>What about the fire brigade?</i>

938
01:22:57,072 --> 01:23:02,237
I'm not havin' a total stranger come in with
a whole crew of blokes when it's me own daughter.

939
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,745
<i>This is family business,
and it'll be handled by the family.</i>

940
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:10,181
- Dad.
- Forget it, Kay. You're talkin' to a brick wall.

941
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,289
Splash.

942
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:18,615
Splash.

943
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:21,560
Splash. Splash.

944
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:29,000
One, two, three...

945
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:32,096
six, four, five.

946
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,077
<i>Hey, Dawnee.</i>

947
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:46,175
- What are you doing here?
- Can I come up?

948
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:49,956
No.

949
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:53,118
Come on, Sweetie.

950
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:55,355
<i>I let you in me pool.</i>

951
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,598
How did you get here?

952
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,565
How did you get up?

953
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:06,105
Climbed up. Up the ladder.

954
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,642
It's heavy.

955
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,718
Tie it up with this.

956
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:37,133
Sweetie.

957
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,967
Bloody shits!

958
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,939
<i>Fuckin'shits.</i>

959
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,010
<i>Sweetie.</i>

960
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:53,683
<i>Hurry up.</i>

961
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:58,384
<i>- Clayton, it's not safe up there.
- Hurry up.</i>

962
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:01,360
<i>- Clayton, come down.
- Here, boy. Come on, laddie.</i>

963
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:03,624
- Oh, for God's sake, Gordon.
- All right.

964
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:05,858
<i>Come on, Clayton. Come down.</i>

965
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:08,527
<i>- Get off! Get off, Dad. - Stop
them. - Sweetie! Cut it out.</i>

966
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:10,433
<i>- It won't hold.
- Piss off!</i>

967
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:12,870
- Clayton. Clayton!
- Shake it. Shake it.

968
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,942
<i>Leave that ladder alone.</i>

969
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:16,601
<i>That's a new suit he's wearing, Dawn.</i>

970
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:19,077
<i>Sweetie, it's dangerous. Please stop.</i>

971
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,341
This is a real crisis.
It's so dangerous.

972
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,349
<i>- Dawn, send Clayton down.
- Piss off!</i>

973
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:25,476
- I'm ringing the fire brigade.
- Oh, please.

974
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,487
He's just a little kid. Dawn!

975
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:32,049
Oh, God, no. Sweetie, will you listen a moment?

976
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,027
Okay? Will you listen to Daddy?

977
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,121
Get the ladder.

978
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:46,535
I'm not going to come up,
but I want you to send Clayton down.

979
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,177
<i>I've gotta take him home, Dawn.</i>

980
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:54,339
<i>- I'm staying up here!
- I'm going to come up just a little way.</i>

981
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,474
To help the little fella down.

982
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:58,984
<i>I'm not coming down ever!</i>

983
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,584
Oh!

984
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:07,889
<i>- Cor!
- It's not funny, Dawn. That's disgusting.</i>

985
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:12,057
What about Clayton?
It's not very fair, Dawn.

986
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,158
"It's not very fair, Dawn."

987
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:16,237
<i>No one's impressed.</i>

988
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:27,645
Sweetie, I've had enough.

989
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:30,980
Be careful, Dad. It's really creaky.

990
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:33,053
<i>All right, Sweetie. Come on down.</i>

991
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:36,089
Kay, go and tell your mother
she's coming down.

992
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:42,428
<i>Mum.</i>

993
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:45,124
Third house on your left as you -
Just come down the drive.

994
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:48,862
Mum. Mum. Dad said to come out.
He's getting her down.

995
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:54,703
Could you hold on a minute?
There's been a development.

996
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:57,300
<i>- Get off!
- Come down, Sweetie, now.</i>

997
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:02,376
Fucking bastard.

998
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:04,974
<i>Drop off! Fucking drop!</i>

999
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:07,281
<i>- Dad! Hang on.
- Oh, me back.</i>

1000
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:10,721
<i>- Let him down, Dawn!
- Stop it, Dawn.</i>

1001
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:13,487
<i>Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump.</i>

1002
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:16,291
<i>- Dawn, it's going to break.
- Break your bloody neck!</i>

1003
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,297
Kay, put the hose on her.

1004
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,299
<i>- Let him go!
- Go on!</i>

1005
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,631
<i>Drop and break your bloody neck!</i>

1006
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:26,229
<i>You bastards! Piss off!</i>

1007
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:28,241
<i>Buzz off!</i>

1008
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:30,607
Hang on. Keep trying.

1009
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,442
Jump! Jump! Jump!

1010
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:38,110
<i>- Fuck off and die!
- No, Sweetie.</i>

1011
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:40,653
<i>Drop!</i>

1012
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,723
<i>Watch your head!</i>

1013
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:45,315
<i>Piss off!</i>

1014
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:00,463
Clayton!

1015
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:03,169
<i>- Clayton!
- Kay.</i>

1016
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,711
Just hang on!

1017
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,842
- You stupid girl.
- How's the boy?

1018
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:15,821
<i>- How's the little fella?
- He's okay.</i>

1019
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,982
<i>Um, take it carefully.</i>

1020
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:20,356
Do you realize...

1021
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:23,055
you could have killed him
with your little tantrum?

1022
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:26,765
<i>I told her to come down.</i>

1023
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:31,233
You're so selfish, Dawn.

1024
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:40,846
<i>Dad.</i>

1025
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:51,759
Dad.

1026

<i>Oh, baby!</i>

1027
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:11,444
Oh, Sweetie! Oh, no, baby.

1028
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:20,754
Oh, Jesus.

1029
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:35,235
Sweetie, come on.

1030
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:37,463
How many breaths?

1031
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:39,540
Oh, God.

1032
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:46,046
Call someone!

1033
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:52,185
Sweetie, breathe!

1034
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:55,819
Come on, Sweetie. Breathe!

1035
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:58,959
Breathe!

<i>Trees never seem to leave us alone.</i>

1037

<i>We couldn't even get the coffin down
for some tree root sticking out the side.</i>

1038
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:26,213
With love.

1039
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:38,859
Want to say something?

1040
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:42,554
Good-bye, Sweetie.

1041
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:44,631
Good girl.

1042
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:53,567
Come on.
We don't want to watch this.

1043

<i>Far</i>

1044

Hey. Do you know what your feet do?

1051
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:47,454
When?

1052
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:52,083
When you're having sex.

1053
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,161
Yeah?

For a moment or an hour

Or when you're near me
