1
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,997
I love you, Billy.

2
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,990
I love you too, Mommy.

3
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,394
Night-night.

4
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:12,903
Sleep tight.

5
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:18,093
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

6
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:23,094
I'll see you in the morning light.

7
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:35,102
I love you.

8
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:59,341
They're going to make me an assistant
art director. So Kenny says:

9
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,978
"You get yourself a Burberry coat.

10
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,694
If you're gonna be Madison Avenue,
you have to look it."

11
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:08,338
Saturday afternoon, I go out,
and it's cold.

12
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:11,496
I go to this place
that specializes in Burberrys...

13
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,338
...and say, " I want a Burberry coat,
37 short."

14
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:17,337
They put it on,
and I look beautiful in it.

15
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,733
I say, " I'll buy it."

16
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,060
And right then, I start to sweat.

17
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:25,177
I take my checkbook out, start to
sign the check, and my hand shakes...

18
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:27,142
...because I'm so scared.

19
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:28,783
- Good night.
- Where you going?

20
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:32,699
- I gotta get home.
- Oh, Jesus, I gotta go.

21
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,178
Okay, so let me finish.

22
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,858
So I sign it,
and my hand starts shaking...

23
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:41,740
Who is this? Danny, right?
Taxi!

24
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:46,102
- Come on, I gotta tell you something.
- I can't. I gotta get home.

25
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:48,938
Gotta talk to you
about something important.

26
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:52,494
I'm putting you in charge
of the Mid-Atlantic account.

27
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:16,416
By the end of the year, we'll
have them up to 10 million.

28
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,741
If this campaign works out the way
I know it will...

29
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:21,781
...they'll offer me a partnership.

30
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:23,303
That's terrific!

31
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:27,702
When that happens, I just want you
to know I'm taking you along.

32
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:32,772
Wow! Wow! That's terrific.

33
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:51,495
Joanna.

34
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:53,742
I'm home.

35
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:59,901
I forgot my keys. I gotta call
the office before they go.

36
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:03,500
Jo, you're gonna be real proud
of me. I got good news.

37
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,702
- Ted.
- One second. Let me just do this.

38
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:15,341
You know Jack Edwards in accounting?
He committed suicide.

39
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,575
Yeah, hi. Ted Kramer.

40
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:21,499
I gotta get those photos from
the retoucher by tomorrow morning.

41
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:24,338
- I'm leaving you.
- Honey, please. I can't hear.

42
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:28,663
Okay, you too. Thanks a lot.
See you tomorrow.

43
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:30,663
Did you guys eat?

44
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:31,780
I'm leaving you.

45
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:36,416
Here are my keys.

46
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:39,656
Here's my American Express,
my Bloomingdale's card...

47
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:43,573
...my checkbook. I've taken
$2000 out of our savings account.

48
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,934
That's what I had when we got married.

49
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:48,823
- Is this a joke?
- Here's the cleaning, laundry ticket.

50
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:51,134
You can pick them both up
on Saturday.

51
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:53,733
- You. You have to pick them up.
- What's wrong?

52
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:57,613
I paid the rent, the Con Ed bill,
and the phone bill, so...

53
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,536
You really pick your times to...

54
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:07,293
I'm sorry I was late, but I was
busy making a living, all right?

55
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:11,181
Come on, okay? Can we stop now?

56
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:13,460
So that's everything.

57
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,102
Enough, enough. All right?

58
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:22,255
What are you doing?

59
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:25,980
Where are you going? Just tell me
what I did that's so terrible.

60
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:27,498
- It's not you.
- Then what?

61
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:29,700
It's me. It's my fault.

62
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,543
You married the wrong person.

63
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:34,139
- I can't hack it.
- Let's just go inside.

64
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:36,340
I can't, I tried.
I swear...

65
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:39,337
Joanna, please, just... I'm sorry.

66
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:44,499
- No, please don't make me go in there.
- I just want to talk.

67
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:47,178
If you do, I swear, one day...

68
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:49,818
...l'll go right out the window.
- Oh, please.

69
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:52,259
Come on, now. What about Billy?

70
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:59,300
I'm not taking him with me.
I'm no good for him.

71
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,137
I'm terrible with him.

72
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:04,103
I have no patience.

73
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,295
He's better off without me.

74
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:09,817
Joanna, please.

75
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:16,694
And I don't love you anymore.

76
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:20,495
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

77
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:56,701
Hi, Margaret. This is Ted.
Is my wife there?

78
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:59,941
Yeah. Joanna come in?

79
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:04,302
We had a little fight. I thought
she might have stopped by.

80
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:07,701
If she comes in, tell her to come up
or just give me a ring.

81
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:13,497
Don't worry. She didn't take
her suitcase. She won't get very far.

82
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:17,821
I got work to do.
If she comes in, tell her to call me.

83
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:26,103
It's about time.

84
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:31,777
Joanna, that's the most insensitive...
Hi, Margaret.

85
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:35,699
- She packed a suitcase?
- Look, it's nothing serious, really.

86
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:37,821
She tell you where she was going?

87
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:40,703
- You tell me.
- How would I know? I wasn't here.

88
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:44,300
Clearly, you two had many
talks about my shortcomings...

89
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:47,416
...which I haven't been privy to.
And I'd love to talk...

90
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:50,781
...but I have a major presentation
in the morning...

91
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:53,743
...and I gotta get my work done.
So please allow me...

92
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:56,498
You don't realize
we have a serious problem.

93
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:59,537
Wrong. Me. I got the problem.
All you gotta do is...

94
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:02,059
...go out the door and go back to bed.

95
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,898
- The fact is...
- For six months...

96
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,580
...l've been spitting blood to get
this agency its biggest account.

97
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:10,815
And at five, we got it.

98
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,896
At eight, the vice president tells me
I'll be the next creative director.

99
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:18,572
I come through this door
to share with my wife...

100
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:22,333
...one of the five best days
of my life, and she looks at me...

101
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:25,098
...and tells me she doesn't want
to live with me!

102
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:32,898
Can't you understand
what she's done to me?

103
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:38,094
She loused up one of the five
best days of your life.

104
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:44,139
You're terrific. Boy, you're...

105
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,295
Thanks very much, really.

106
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,383
Sisterhood.

107
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,740
Thank you for coming
to cheer me up, but...

108
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:53,941
I didn't come to cheer you up.

109
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:56,015
I'm concerned about Joanna.

110
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:59,900
Maybe you can be concerned
in the privacy of your own apartment.

111
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:05,016
Joanna and I never had any problems
until you and Charley split up.

112
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,141
Oh, I don't believe you.

113
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,102
Just tell me the truth, okay?

114
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:10,936
Did you set her up to this?

115
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:13,015
No, I didn't put her up to this.

116
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,573
- Give her a little pep talk?
- No, I didn't.

117
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,735
Joanna and I talk a great deal.

118
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,020
And Joanna is a very unhappy woman.

119
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:24,542
And it took a lot of courage for her
to walk out of here.

120
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:27,696
How much courage does it take
to walk out on your kid?

121
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:40,297
Where's Mommy?

122
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,102
- What?
- Where's Mommy?

123
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:43,703
What time is it?

124
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:49,500
The little hand's on the 7, the big
hand's on the 9. Where's Mommy?

125
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:56,133
Oh, God. Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
You want to know where Mommy is?

126
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:59,541
- She's supposed to take me to school.
- She told me to do it.

127
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:01,621
Okay, I'll tell you where she went.

128
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:05,373
You know when you and your friends
don't get along and fight?

129
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,098
And you want to go and be alone
for a while?

130
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,864
Sometimes Mommy and Daddy
don't get along...

131
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,693
...and one of them wants to go
and be by themselves for a while.

132
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:17,134
- When is Mommy coming back?
- Soon.

133
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:20,740
Now we are gonna have breakfast!
Okay? Just you and me.

134
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:23,020
- What do you want?
- French toast.

135
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:25,295
You want French toast, you got it.

136
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:28,541
Put up a little water for Daddy
to have some coffee.

137
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:31,696
We got how many eggs?
Two for you and two for me.

138
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:32,933
We got milk.

139
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,537
We got butter.

140
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:36,502
We got $5.

141
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:39,093
I got $5.
Here, you sit here.

142
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:42,503
Okay, can you be my number one helper?

143
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,413
Watch this. One hand.

144
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:47,503
Here we go.

145
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:50,423
Did you know that all
the best chefs are men?

146
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,701
Isn't this terrific?
We gotta do this more often.

147
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:56,293
- You dropped some shell in it.
- That's okay.

148
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:59,980
Makes it crunchier.
You like it crunchy, don't you?

149
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:03,893
Why don't you beat them,
and I'll get everything else going.

150
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:06,021
- What time is school?
- 8:30.

151
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:10,257
Gotta get the show on the road.
I gotta shower, shave and shampoo.

152
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:11,539
I got people to see.

153
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:14,218
And Daddy's gotta bring home
the bacon...

154
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:15,857
...and he's gotta cook it.

155
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:19,142
We're having a good time!
Where does Mommy keep the...?

156
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:21,580
- In the stove.
- The pan. The stove.

157
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,297
First, we need a nice fire.

158
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:28,135
No, you're not doing it right.

159
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:31,694
Look, you gotta do it fast. See?
It's the wrist.

160
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:33,701
So the gucky part dissolves.

161
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:37,533
Then you take the bread, and we...

162
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,376
We...

163
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:43,296
We fold the French toast.
That's what we do.

164
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:46,934
- I think you forgot milk.
- I didn't. Milk comes last.

165
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:50,704
When you're having a good time
you forget things.

166
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:54,456
I just wanted to see
if you're paying attention.

167
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:58,340
Fun, isn't it? When's the last
time Mommy let you in the kitchen?

168
00:13:58,584 --> 00:13:59,983
I don't like it in pieces.

169
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:04,137
It tastes the same whether it's in
pieces or whole. Bread is bread.

170
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:06,699
Besides, French toast
is always folded.

171
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:10,016
In the best restaurants,
you see folded French toast.

172
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:12,101
You get more bites that way.

173
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:16,936
And while that's going,
Daddy's gonna make coffee.

174
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,697
You having a good time?

175
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:22,340
I don't remember the last
time I had such a good time.

176
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:25,061
Daddy's gonna make himself coffee.

177
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:27,613
- That's too much!
- No, I like it strong.

178
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:29,900
Mommy always makes it too weak.

179
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:33,901
Can I have some orange juice?

180
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,934
Right. One OJ coming up
for the kid.

181
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,743
Daddy, it's burning!

182
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:43,096
- What?
- It's burning!

183
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:47,822
Damn it! Goddamn her!

184
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,496
Oh, shit.

185
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:58,219
Just take it easy.
Everything is fine. We're terrific.

186
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,897
Just...

187
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:04,296
Just take it easy.
Nothing is the matter.

188
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:09,217
- What?
- Your hand's sweaty.

189
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:11,898
- When's Mommy coming back?
- Soon. I told you.

190
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,341
- Is she gonna pick me up?
- Probably. If she doesn't, I will.

191
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:17,341
- What if you forget?
- I won't.

192
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,781
- What if you get run over?
- Mommy will pick you up.

193
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:23,094
- Miss! What grade are you in?
- First.

194
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:25,738
This is Billy Kramer.
He's in first grade.

195
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:28,219
Take care of him. I gotta
get a taxi, I'm late. Taxi!

196
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:30,337
Taxi!

197
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:35,777
- Congratulations about Mid-Atlantic.
- Thanks.

198
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:39,300
- Congratulations.
- Is the stuff back from the retoucher?

199
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,734
- Great news, Ted.
- Thanks a lot.

200
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,293
Morning. 11:00, meeting
with Airwick...

201
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,695
- Where's the stuff from the retoucher?
- Right here.

202
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:49,697
- Did my wife call?
- No.

203
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:53,095
You're gonna have to cancel
the Airwick at 11:30.

204
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,141
She's never gone this far before,
but in the past...

205
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:29,103
...l've known
when she's upset because...

206
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:30,936
...she gets very quiet.

207
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:34,574
Our pattern has been that I've said,
"What's the matter?"...

208
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:36,615
...and she'll kind of sit on it.

209
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:39,776
But in the last few weeks,
maybe couple of months...

210
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:43,772
...since we've been going crazy
with this account, I've been remiss.

211
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:49,144
And I just didn't look at the writing
on the wall, so she's kind of...

212
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:53,100
I think this is a way
of making me stop, look and say:

213
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,340
" I'm as important as your work."

214
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,535
Is there another guy?

215
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:04,103
I don't think so.
She's not the type.

216
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:07,097
She's got this friend, Margaret,
downstairs...

217
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:11,902
...you know, women's lib.
I think they may have cooked this up.

218
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:13,893
It worked.

219
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:16,537
I'm going crazy!

220
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:18,900
Look, not to worry.

221
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,583
She'll be back.

222
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:23,099
I didn't know it would happen to me!

223
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:25,497
Don't let it get you down.

224
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,054
I know she'll be back.
I'm terrific, really.

225
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:34,263
- You do have a problem, Ted.
- Yeah, what's that?

226
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:38,895
What are you gonna do about Billy?

227
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:44,372
This just happened last night.
I'm sure when Joanna comes back...

228
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:46,734
It's none of my business.
I'll butt out.

229
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,458
Listen, I want to hear your thoughts.

230
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:52,741
I appreciate you
taking the time to talk to me.

231
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:57,337
May sound a little rough, but...

232
00:17:57,584 --> 00:18:01,702
...I think you ought to send Billy away
to stay with relatives for a while.

233
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:04,499
You mean, until Joanna comes back?

234
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:07,499
Suppose Joanna doesn't come back?

235
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:12,302
Gee, I don't know...

236
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:14,023
Ted, listen to me.

237
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:19,338
I just told the boys upstairs you're
handling the Mid-Atlantic account.

238
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:23,935
You know? A gig like that comes
along once every five, six years.

239
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:28,302
There's guys here eating their hearts
out because I gave that spot to you.

240
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:31,780
This is important. Don't blow this.

241
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:35,699
I gotta depend on you. I gotta count
on you for 110 percent...

242
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:40,097
...7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
I gotta have that.

243
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:43,654
I can't be concerned about you
worrying about a kid.

244
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:47,693
First, you can count on me
25 hours a day, 8 days a week.

245
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:49,701
Because I'm not a loser, Jim.

246
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:52,697
I never let anything at home
come into the office.

247
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:55,139
You asked me to unload in this office.

248
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,899
When I go outside, I'm on top of it.
I want you to know that.

249
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,413
I'm a survivor.

250
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:05,293
You've given me a shot here.
I'm not gonna let anything blow it.

251
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,103
Okay?

252
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:13,102
Let's have a drink later.
I'm all right. I gotta...

253
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:15,494
...blow smoke up Airwick's ass, 11:00.

254
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:17,302
I'm all right!

255
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,937
You don't worry.

256
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:20,463
Thank you.

257
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:23,500
I love you, you bastard.

258
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:30,738
Daddy?

259
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:32,702
Daddy?

260
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:39,293
Yeah, honey, just wait a second.
I just want to finish this idea.

261
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:42,183
Let me get this copy done,
and then I'll talk.

262
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:46,497
What time is it when an elephant
sits on your fence?

263
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:49,894
Time to get a new fence.

264
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:55,778
Honey, please...
I just got this sentence.

265
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:57,372
Daddy! Daddy!

266
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,498
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

267
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:02,821
Get over there and sit
on that couch and don't move!

268
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:05,624
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew it!

269
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:09,220
Who told you not to drink
this stuff here?

270
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:11,343
- Sorry.
- Yeah, you're sorry.

271
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,138
Told you to keep that juice
in the dining room!

272
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:16,093
Sorry.

273
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:20,021
Who took you to the park, gave you
everything you wanted?

274
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:22,380
- Who bought you an ice cream?
- You.

275
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:26,412
And who promised Daddy that when
we got home, you'd let him work?

276
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:30,896
- That's ruined. I can't fix that.
- Sorry.

277
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:39,296
It's past your bedtime.
Why don't you go to sleep?

278
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:47,298
And brush your teeth
and flush the toilet.

279
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,297
- Paper towels. What else?
- We need detergent.

280
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:56,533
All right.

281
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:59,935
No, Mommy buys the kind
with the orange circles on it.

282
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:03,062
- There's no difference.
- Mom said it was the best.

283
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:09,301
- Let's go.
- Get the pink stuff.

284
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,778
All right, come on.

285
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:15,492
Okay. That's it.

286
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:18,495
We need some cereal.

287
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:20,902
Okay, what colour?

288
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:32,499
Hey, Billy!

289
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:36,014
Billy! Told you Mommy would write
before the week was up.

290
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:40,098
- When is she coming back?
- That's what we're gonna find out now.

291
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:43,698
Okay. Let's read it.

292
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,903
" My dearest, sweet Billy."

293
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:55,902
That's you.

294
00:21:58,104 --> 00:22:00,095
" Mommy has gone away.

295
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,699
Sometimes in the world...

296
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,178
...daddies go away...

297
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,938
...and mommies bring up
their little boys.

298
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:09,937
But sometimes, a mommy
can go away too...

299
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:13,136
...and you have your daddy
to bring you up.

300
00:22:13,384 --> 00:22:15,579
I have gone away
because I must find...

301
00:22:15,824 --> 00:22:19,533
...something interesting to do
for myself in the world.

302
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:22,298
Everybody has to, and so do I.

303
00:22:26,064 --> 00:22:30,501
Being your mommy was one thing,
but there are other things too...

304
00:22:30,744 --> 00:22:33,577
...and this is what I have to do.

305
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:36,133
I did not get a chance
to tell you this...

306
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:39,023
...and that is why
I'm writing you now.

307
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:41,698
I will always be your mommy...

308
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:45,499
...and I will always love you.

309
00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:48,579
I just won't be your mommy
in the house...

310
00:22:48,824 --> 00:22:51,292
...but I'll be your mommy
at the heart.

311
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,613
And now I must go
and be the person I have to be."

312
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,502
We'll read this another time.

313
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:04,103
I don't care.

314
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,415
- Good night, Jim.
- Come on in.

315
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:16,900
- Have a drink.
- I can't, I'm late now.

316
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:20,699
What's the rush? We're having
a party for Norman. Five years here.

317
00:24:20,904 --> 00:24:21,939
Can you believe it?

318
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:24,823
Wish I could, but I'm late.
I gotta pick up Billy.

319
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,901
You know Jerry Hoover, in media?

320
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,937
Tell you something funny.

321
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:30,702
Gotta go. See you Monday.

322
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:37,297
Taxi!

323
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:39,617
Taxi!

324
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,098
- Here, keep the change.
- Thanks.

325
00:25:02,264 --> 00:25:04,903
Hi, Mrs. Kline. I'm sorry I'm late.

326
00:25:05,144 --> 00:25:07,453
That's all right, but Billy is upset.

327
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:10,095
Hey, how's it going, sport?

328
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:14,341
I had a little trouble
getting away from the office.

329
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:17,092
Sorry. Come on, let's get going.

330
00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:20,816
Thanks for coming, Billy.
Oh, wait a minute.

331
00:25:21,064 --> 00:25:23,862
- Don't forget your goody bag.
- Thanks very much.

332
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:25,702
- Bye.
- Thanks a lot.

333
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:29,294
- So, did you have a lot of fun?
- You're late.

334
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:32,223
- I'm not that late. Only 20 minutes.
- Want to bet?

335
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:36,303
All the other mothers were there
before you.

336
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:42,654
Why are you making such a big deal
of it? There was traffic.

337
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:48,614
If you want to be a big boy...

338
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:52,573
...you learn that when somebody says
they're sorry...

339
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:57,818
...you don't hold a grudge
and make them feel bad for...

340
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:00,897
...a long time afterwards.

341
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:02,696
Okay, go ahead.

342
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:08,383
Don't eat with your fingers.
Come on, Billy.

343
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:11,696
You know better than that.
Here.

344
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:13,297
Use a fork.

345
00:26:16,104 --> 00:26:18,902
Come on, come on.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

346
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,496
How was school today?

347
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,536
Same as usual.

348
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,900
I see the Knicks finally won a game.

349
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:27,896
I don't care.

350
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:29,617
What do you mean?

351
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:32,742
- I like Boston.
- Boston? Why do you like Boston?

352
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:35,300
Because Mommy's from Boston.

353
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:41,615
Sit up and try to eat. Come on.

354
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:44,742
Can I be excused?
I want to go to bed.

355
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:46,303
Too much birthday cake?

356
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,096
Yeah, I guess.

357
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:49,017
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

358
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,492
Louise, give me a hand.

359
00:30:50,744 --> 00:30:52,097
You're 15 minutes late.

360
00:30:52,344 --> 00:30:54,733
- Mr. O'Connor is very upset.
- This all of it?

361
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:58,897
- Yes. Do you want your mail now?
- No, just give me the messages.

362
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:02,375
Remind me to get
a Crying Chrissie doll at lunch.

363
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:03,898
Okay, okay.

364
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:04,974
Sorry I'm late.

365
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:09,297
And there's a PTA meeting
at the school on Tuesday at 4.

366
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,132
Right, thanks.

367
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:15,944
Put the chicken in the refrigerator.

368
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,816
Know who Charley's seeing now?

369
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,019
Who?

370
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:25,340
A divorced woman with two little girls
the same age as Kim and Petey.

371
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,381
- Are you kidding?
- No.

372
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:28,579
How do you know?

373
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:30,576
I know.

374
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:33,543
How long has it been since
you two broke up?

375
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:34,694
Year and a half.

376
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:37,020
That long?

377
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:39,255
Did I ever tell you how sorry...

378
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,376
...how sad Joanna and I were
when you guys split?

379
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:46,700
Look at that cute little boy
over there.

380
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:49,099
You think you'll ever
get married again?

381
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:53,735
- I mean, to anybody.
- No.

382
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:55,303
Why?

383
00:31:56,744 --> 00:32:00,100
Maybe it's different if you don't
have children, but...

384
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:05,623
...even if Charley and I aren't living
together, and even if we're...

385
00:32:05,864 --> 00:32:10,699
...sleeping with other people, even
if he were to get married again...

386
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:13,496
...he's still my husband...

387
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:16,702
...and he's still the father of my
children and...

388
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:22,338
That stuff about "till death do you
part," that's really true.

389
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:26,054
Let's say Charley finishes
his midlife crisis...

390
00:32:26,264 --> 00:32:30,098
...he's had it with his flings
and comes asking for forgiveness.

391
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:31,896
What would you do?

392
00:32:35,824 --> 00:32:40,614
I think that if he really loved me...

393
00:32:40,864 --> 00:32:43,173
...he wouldn't have let me
divorce him.

394
00:32:51,944 --> 00:32:54,094
You still think about him, don't you?

395
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:57,500
Only all the time.

396
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,893
- Think about Joanna?
- Never.

397
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:11,101
Liar.

398
00:33:13,264 --> 00:33:15,300
Some pair, boy.

399
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:17,898
I don't believe it.

400
00:33:18,144 --> 00:33:20,419
- You missed the closing.
- I'm sorry.

401
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:24,782
Look, I gotta tell you something.
I'm getting very nervous here.

402
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:28,021
Ever since your wife left you.
Is it eight months now?

403
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:29,936
You're not getting any better.

404
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:31,219
What do you mean?

405
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:36,492
Look, I can't let your family problems
interfere with my responsibilities.

406
00:33:36,704 --> 00:33:37,898
I got a shop to run.

407
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:41,580
I regret it, and I promise you
it will never happen again.

408
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:43,099
Okay?

409
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,093
Yeah?

410
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,219
Yeah, wait a minute.

411
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,614
- It's for you, pick up 461.
- Who is it?

412
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:56,094
Pick up 461.

413
00:33:58,584 --> 00:33:59,903
Yeah?

414
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:03,093
Oh, hi, Billy. What's up?

415
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:06,701
No, one hour of television a day.
That's the rule.

416
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:08,499
No.

417
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:13,052
I don't care what the other
mothers do, Billy. We made a deal.

418
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:15,295
I can't talk now. I'm busy.

419
00:34:16,144 --> 00:34:19,773
We will talk about it tonight
when I get home, all right?

420
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:22,498
Double chocolate chip. I remember.

421
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,143
I'm getting very nervous.

422
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:36,860
Put that down and eat your dinner.

423
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:38,457
What is this crap?

424
00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:41,454
- It's Salisbury steak.
- I hate it.

425
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:44,098
You had it last week and you loved it.

426
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:47,660
No, I didn't. I hate the brown
stuff. It's gross.

427
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:50,173
- It's onions and gravy.
- I'm allergic to onions.

428
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,739
You are not.
You had this last week...

429
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:56,818
...and I said it was my favourite and you
said, " It's my favourite too."

430
00:34:57,024 --> 00:34:58,662
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

431
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:01,052
It's regular hamburger.

432
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:02,862
Take a bite. It's delicious.

433
00:35:04,864 --> 00:35:05,819
What's the matter?

434
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,383
I'm gonna throw up.

435
00:35:07,664 --> 00:35:09,655
- No, you're not.
- It's yucky.

436
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:12,662
It is not yucky, Billy. Eat it.

437
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:20,257
Did you bring the chocolate chip
ice cream home?

438
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:24,097
Yes, I brought the chocolate chip
ice cream home...

439
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:27,654
...and you can't have it until
you eat all your dinner...

440
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:30,654
Where are you going?
Get back here now.

441
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:32,217
Did you hear me?

442
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,579
You'd better not do that.

443
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,984
You'd better stop right there.
I'm warning you.

444
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,893
Did you hear me?

445
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:46,301
Now, you listen to me.
Don't be smart.

446
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,899
Put that back until you finish
your dinner.

447
00:35:51,664 --> 00:35:54,462
If you take one bite out of that,
you're in trouble.

448
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:59,178
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare do that.

449
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,176
You hear me? Hold it right there.

450
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:06,299
You put that ice cream in your mouth
and you are in very big trouble.

451
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:09,661
Don't you dare go anywhere
beyond that. Put it down.

452
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:13,903
I am not going to say it again.
I am not going to say it again.

453
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:18,053
You're hurting me!

454
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:19,938
Don't you kick me.

455
00:36:20,904 --> 00:36:23,577
- I hate you!
- You're no bargain either, pal.

456
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:25,979
You are a spoiled little brat!

457
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:28,863
- I hate you!
- I hate you back, you little shit!

458
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:32,375
- I want my mommy!
- I'm all you've got.

459
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:37,298
I want my mommy!

460
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:43,058
I want my mommy!

461
00:36:48,904 --> 00:36:52,055
I want my mommy!

462
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,862
Mommy...

463
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:47,459
Daddy?

464
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:49,580
Daddy?

465
00:37:49,944 --> 00:37:51,855
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

466
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:54,372
I'm sorry too.

467
00:37:57,544 --> 00:38:00,263
I want you to go to sleep
because it's really late.

468
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:02,859
Daddy?

469
00:38:03,624 --> 00:38:04,739
Now what is it?

470
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:06,897
Are you going away?

471
00:38:07,824 --> 00:38:08,654
No.

472
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:12,654
I'm staying here with you.
You can't get rid of me that easy.

473
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:16,022
That's why Mommy left, isn't it?
Because I was bad?

474
00:38:17,984 --> 00:38:19,303
Is that what you think?

475
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:21,774
No.

476
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:27,057
That's not it, Billy.
Your mom loves you very much...

477
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,859
...and the reason she left has
nothing to do with you.

478
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:37,574
I don't know if this will make sense,
but I'll try to explain it to you.

479
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:43,098
I think the reason why Mommy left...

480
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:45,662
...was because for a long time...

481
00:38:45,904 --> 00:38:50,819
...I kept trying to make her be
a certain kind of person.

482
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:56,300
A certain kind of wife that
I thought she was supposed to be.

483
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:59,502
And she just wasn't like that.
She was...

484
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,262
She just wasn't like that.

485
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:09,573
I think that she tried for so long
to make me happy...

486
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:13,660
...and when she couldn't,
she tried to talk to me about it.

487
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:18,416
But I wasn't listening.
I was too busy, too wrapped up...

488
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:20,780
...just thinking about myself.

489
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:25,736
And I thought that anytime
I was happy, she was happy.

490
00:39:25,944 --> 00:39:30,017
But I think underneath
she was very sad.

491
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:36,175
Mommy stayed here longer than she
wanted because she loves you so much.

492
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:41,093
And the reason why Mommy
couldn't stay anymore...

493
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:43,539
...was because she couldn't stand me.

494
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:47,062
She didn't leave because of you.
She left because of me.

495
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,853
Go to sleep now because
it's really late, okay?

496
00:40:08,024 --> 00:40:08,854
Good night.

497
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:11,738
- Sleep tight.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.

498
00:40:11,944 --> 00:40:13,457
See you in the morning light.

499
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:15,577
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

500
00:40:17,344 --> 00:40:18,857
I love you.

501
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:22,457
I love you too.

502
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:42,777
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ladies and gentlemen...

503
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,060
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

504
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,859
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

505
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:56,258
- With gruesome goblins.
- With gruesome goblins.

506
00:40:56,944 --> 00:40:58,502
And ghostly ghosts.

507
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:02,374
And wicked witches and spooky spooks.

508
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:19,498
Tom, you and I both know
it's a violation of privacy laws.

509
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:23,498
Look, it doesn't make any difference.
It's name or likeness.

510
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:27,293
I don't care. Tell them if they
want it, they have to pay for it.

511
00:41:27,544 --> 00:41:29,057
All right, bye-bye.

512
00:41:29,624 --> 00:41:30,454
Hello, Kramer.

513
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:32,820
Can you check the copy
on Mid-Atlantic?

514
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,662
I think it's okay.

515
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:45,900
Yes.

516
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:49,292
Yes, what?

517
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:53,183
I'll have dinner with you.

518
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:01,099
Thank you.

519
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:03,217
You're welcome.

520
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,454
Oh, shit!

521
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:29,336
- I gotta go.
- What's the matter?

522
00:42:29,824 --> 00:42:30,620
I gotta go.

523
00:42:30,824 --> 00:42:33,782
- Want me to call a cab?
- No, I've got an 8:00 meeting.

524
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,497
- Where you going?
- Bathroom.

525
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:37,979
That's a closet.
Bathroom's over there.

526
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:40,062
Yeah, you're right.

527
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:45,020
These morons are violating the FTC
regulations, and I have to make sure...

528
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,258
Hi.

529
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:52,379
- What's your name?
- I'm Phyllis Bernard.

530
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:53,420
Who?

531
00:42:53,624 --> 00:42:57,583
I'm a friend, uh, business associate
of your father's.

532
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,133
Oh, Jesus.

533
00:43:01,424 --> 00:43:04,973
- Do you like fried chicken?
- Fried chicken? Very much.

534
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:06,259
So do I.

535
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:11,219
Well, it's really...

536
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,382
It's nice seeing you and...

537
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:15,773
- Bye.
- Bye.

538
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:21,813
Kramer, I just met your son.

539
00:43:22,104 --> 00:43:26,256
Come on, you're never going to do
this if you don't concentrate.

540
00:43:26,864 --> 00:43:31,460
All right, come on. Thattaboy.
Get your centre.

541
00:43:31,704 --> 00:43:33,296
Okay? How's it feel?

542
00:43:33,664 --> 00:43:34,460
Good.

543
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:38,737
Keep it going, keep it going!
That's terrific!

544
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:42,295
Don't stop! Billy, keep your
feet moving!

545
00:43:43,264 --> 00:43:45,459
Oh, that's terrific.
How do you feel?

546
00:43:45,744 --> 00:43:47,780
- Good!
- You look great!

547
00:43:54,464 --> 00:43:56,659
Don't go too far!

548
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:03,662
- Yeah?
- And so the dog really hurt Tom.

549
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:07,453
So Tom got so mad, he jumped in
the potato salad...

550
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:09,734
...and he pushed over the table.

551
00:44:09,944 --> 00:44:10,820
Yeah?

552
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:12,656
- Then...
- Let me get your shoelace.

553
00:44:12,864 --> 00:44:13,979
Then what happened?

554
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:18,382
The big dog kept chasing him,
then he flipped the table.

555
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:20,660
- With all the stuff coming down?
- Yeah.

556
00:44:21,024 --> 00:44:21,900
Then what happened?

557
00:44:22,144 --> 00:44:24,260
I don't want to be late for school.

558
00:44:24,504 --> 00:44:26,381
Here's your homework. Give me a kiss.

559
00:44:28,104 --> 00:44:29,332
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

560
00:44:37,504 --> 00:44:38,857
Taxi!

561
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:42,458
Hi.

562
00:44:50,944 --> 00:44:54,698
Your babysitter answers,
wouldn't say where you were.

563
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:56,417
Tell me where you were.

564
00:44:56,624 --> 00:44:57,579
Well...

565
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:01,981
...my French professor finally
asked me out.

566
00:45:02,264 --> 00:45:04,300
- When?
- The other day.

567
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:05,574
You had a date.

568
00:45:05,864 --> 00:45:07,820
I knew you were keeping
something from me!

569
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:11,101
- I thought he was a pretty neat guy.
- Right.

570
00:45:11,504 --> 00:45:13,176
- So we go to dinner.
- Yeah?

571
00:45:13,424 --> 00:45:15,255
I find out he's married.

572
00:45:15,944 --> 00:45:17,900
He's deep in analysis.

573
00:45:19,024 --> 00:45:21,538
- He's telling me his life story...
- Wonderful!

574
00:45:21,784 --> 00:45:24,252
...and all I can think of
while I sit there...

575
00:45:24,464 --> 00:45:27,456
...is that I'm paying a babysitter
$3.25 an hour...

576
00:45:27,744 --> 00:45:29,541
...to listen to his problems.

577
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:32,372
Daddy! Daddy, look!

578
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:34,654
- Take that out of your hand.
- I'll get him.

579
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:37,023
Did you hear me?

580
00:45:42,744 --> 00:45:44,860
Hold it, hold it!

581
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:48,860
It hurts, Daddy.

582
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:53,415
- Daddy, hurry.
- Okay.

583
00:45:58,304 --> 00:46:00,135
- I can't see, Daddy.
- Rest your head.

584
00:46:01,304 --> 00:46:02,657
Watch it!

585
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:07,015
Daddy, please hurry.

586
00:46:07,624 --> 00:46:09,580
- We're almost there.
- Can't see in my eye.

587
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:13,061
Let me see.
Where's the emergency room?!

588
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:22,703
How did this happen?

589
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:24,775
He fell off the jungle gym.

590
00:46:25,624 --> 00:46:26,818
He had a plane in his hand.

591
00:46:27,024 --> 00:46:28,252
I'm just about through.

592
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:30,341
- Don't hurt him.
- I won't hurt him.

593
00:46:30,544 --> 00:46:33,183
Mr. Kramer, can I talk to you outside?

594
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:34,743
Yeah. Can she come in?

595
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:35,900
Margaret, come in.

596
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:38,302
- Stay, Daddy.
- I'll be right back.

597
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:41,297
- Daddy, stay.
- I'm just outside.

598
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:42,812
It's all right, darling.

599
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:44,503
I'm just talking to the doctor.

600
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:46,773
He'll be right back.

601
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:47,894
I'm right here.

602
00:46:49,024 --> 00:46:50,059
Will he lose his eye?

603
00:46:50,264 --> 00:46:53,574
No, but I have to take some stitches.

604
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:54,700
How many?

605
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:56,978
- About 10.
- What?

606
00:46:57,224 --> 00:47:00,660
Don't worry. There won't be
much of a scar.

607
00:47:01,224 --> 00:47:03,943
This will take about 15 minutes,
so step over here.

608
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:05,577
I want to be in there with him.

609
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:08,344
- You don't need to be in there.
- He's my son.

610
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:11,458
If you're gonna do something,
I'm gonna be with him.

611
00:47:12,304 --> 00:47:14,499
Good boy. You're really brave.

612
00:47:24,504 --> 00:47:26,381
That was a big one.

613
00:47:32,544 --> 00:47:34,136
Stop it.

614
00:47:40,784 --> 00:47:45,699
Okay, we're almost done now.
We're almost done now.

615
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:26,180
How is he?

616
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:29,462
He's okay. He's sleeping.

617
00:48:29,944 --> 00:48:32,060
It's okay. I can do that.

618
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:36,703
Ted, I'm so sorry.
I feel responsible.

619
00:48:37,104 --> 00:48:38,537
I don't know what happened.

620
00:48:39,064 --> 00:48:42,500
One minute he was there and the
next he was lying on the ground.

621
00:48:43,664 --> 00:48:45,097
Come on, Margaret.

622
00:48:45,744 --> 00:48:48,463
Now listen, I want
to ask you a favour, okay?

623
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,454
It's a big favour.

624
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:55,180
If something happened to me...
I'm not saying anything will...

625
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:57,818
...but if a building fell on me...

626
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:02,058
...would you consider
taking care of Billy?

627
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:09,534
I want you to know that I put
some thought into this...

628
00:49:09,744 --> 00:49:10,540
...and I...

629
00:49:11,464 --> 00:49:14,262
...can't think of anybody else
I would trust with him.

630
00:49:14,904 --> 00:49:17,464
I know you'd be okay
with him because...

631
00:49:19,184 --> 00:49:20,856
...you're a good mother.

632
00:49:26,304 --> 00:49:28,260
You're a lousy dishwasher.

633
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,215
- All right?
- Okay.

634
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,662
You're all right.

635
00:49:56,584 --> 00:49:58,461
Louise, you want to get that?

636
00:50:01,184 --> 00:50:03,982
Louise, it's ringing...
Yeah, hello.

637
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:06,663
Yes, who is this?

638
00:50:10,864 --> 00:50:11,819
Joanna.

639
00:50:30,544 --> 00:50:31,340
Hi.

640
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,183
- Hi.
- How are you?

641
00:50:34,384 --> 00:50:35,658
You look great.

642
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,057
- How's your...?
- What?

643
00:50:39,824 --> 00:50:42,622
- I'm sorry.
- I was saying, how's your job?

644
00:50:42,904 --> 00:50:45,179
Fine. Vice president of nothing.

645
00:50:45,424 --> 00:50:46,573
No, really, it's great.

646
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:49,054
- Would you like a drink?
- Whatever she has.

647
00:50:49,264 --> 00:50:50,299
- White wine.
- Wine.

648
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:52,742
- How's Billy?
- He's terrific.

649
00:50:53,424 --> 00:50:56,973
He had a little accident in a
playground. He cut himself.

650
00:50:57,344 --> 00:51:00,063
It was scary.
I ran him to the hospital.

651
00:51:00,264 --> 00:51:02,494
He has a little scar,
but he'll be fine.

652
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:04,979
I've been worrying
that it's my fault...

653
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:08,341
Don't do that. You can't even
see it from a distance.

654
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:15,817
I sit in the coffee shop across
from his school and watch him.

655
00:51:16,024 --> 00:51:17,343
He got so big.

656
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:18,943
You've been watching him?

657
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:21,254
I've been in New York for
about two months now.

658
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:22,658
I didn't know that.

659
00:51:23,424 --> 00:51:24,857
Anyway...

660
00:51:25,344 --> 00:51:27,983
That's why I wanted
to talk to you today.

661
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:33,454
Last time you saw me,
I was in pretty bad...

662
00:51:33,784 --> 00:51:35,342
- Shaky?
- Really bad shape.

663
00:51:35,584 --> 00:51:37,063
Yeah, I was.

664
00:51:37,504 --> 00:51:38,380
I was.

665
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:41,454
Well, you look lovely now.

666
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,015
- What?
- I have a whole speech.

667
00:51:46,264 --> 00:51:47,663
Go ahead.

668
00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:53,979
All my life I've felt like...

669
00:51:54,184 --> 00:51:57,256
...somebody's wife or mother
or daughter.

670
00:51:57,504 --> 00:52:01,258
Even when we were together
I never knew who I was.

671
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,143
That's why I had to go away.

672
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:06,621
In California, I think I found myself.

673
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,303
I got myself a job.

674
00:52:08,664 --> 00:52:11,462
I got myself a therapist,
a really good one.

675
00:52:12,744 --> 00:52:17,022
And I feel better about myself
than I ever have in my whole life.

676
00:52:17,224 --> 00:52:19,499
I learned a lot about myself.

677
00:52:20,824 --> 00:52:21,734
Such as?

678
00:52:23,784 --> 00:52:27,743
No, really, I'd really like to
know what you learned.

679
00:52:32,704 --> 00:52:36,538
I've learned
that I love my little boy.

680
00:52:37,784 --> 00:52:40,821
And that I'm capable of taking
care of him.

681
00:52:41,064 --> 00:52:42,463
What do you mean?

682
00:52:45,024 --> 00:52:46,059
I want my son.

683
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:48,013
You can't have him.

684
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:50,459
Don't get defensive. Don't bully me.

685
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:52,023
I'm not getting defensive.

686
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:54,056
Who walked out 15 months ago?

687
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,420
I don't care. I'm still his mother.

688
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:57,893
From 3000 miles away.

689
00:52:58,104 --> 00:53:01,176
Because you sent post cards gives
you the right to come back?

690
00:53:01,384 --> 00:53:03,102
I never stopped wanting him.

691
00:53:03,304 --> 00:53:04,862
What makes you sure he wants you?

692
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:06,982
What makes you sure he doesn't?

693
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:11,302
We're gonna sit here and
bat this back and forth.

694
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:13,620
- It's like old times.
- You can't deny me...

695
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:16,861
Don't tell me what I can or cannot do.

696
00:53:17,184 --> 00:53:20,256
- Don't talk to me that way.
- I anticipated this.

697
00:53:20,504 --> 00:53:22,734
Do what you have to.
I'll do what I have to.

698
00:53:22,984 --> 00:53:24,099
I'm sorry about this.

699
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:26,096
Do what you have to do.

700
00:53:33,424 --> 00:53:36,973
I don't know the legal jargon for it,
but I think it's "desertion."

701
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:42,173
I don't mean to tell you your job,
but I have an open-and-shut case.

702
00:53:42,424 --> 00:53:46,463
There's no such thing as an open-and-
shut case where custody is involved.

703
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:50,023
I'll bet your ex-wife
has already found a lawyer...

704
00:53:50,224 --> 00:53:53,136
...who's advised her to move back
to establish residency.

705
00:53:53,384 --> 00:53:57,343
The burden is on us to prove
that your ex-wife is an unfit mother.

706
00:53:57,584 --> 00:54:00,974
That means I'll have to play rough.
If I play rough...

707
00:54:01,224 --> 00:54:04,341
...you can bet they will too.
Can you take that?

708
00:54:04,544 --> 00:54:05,533
Yes.

709
00:54:06,384 --> 00:54:08,454
And it's going to cost you $15,000.

710
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:11,299
That's if we win.

711
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:14,138
If we go to appeal,
it'll cost you more.

712
00:54:15,344 --> 00:54:16,333
I understand.

713
00:54:18,184 --> 00:54:20,175
Now, how old is the child again?

714
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,937
My son is 7.

715
00:54:22,184 --> 00:54:23,776
- That's tough.
- Why?

716
00:54:24,024 --> 00:54:28,017
In cases involving a child that young,
the court tends to side with her.

717
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,458
She signed over custody.

718
00:54:29,704 --> 00:54:33,140
I'm not saying we don't have a shot,
but it won't be easy.

719
00:54:33,424 --> 00:54:35,176
Do me a favour, will you?

720
00:54:35,424 --> 00:54:38,177
There's something I find useful
in matters like this.

721
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:42,258
I sit down and I write out all
the pros and cons on an issue.

722
00:54:42,504 --> 00:54:44,017
Write them and look at them.

723
00:54:45,624 --> 00:54:47,660
- I want you to do that, okay?
- Okay.

724
00:54:47,904 --> 00:54:49,178
And after that...

725
00:54:49,384 --> 00:54:52,933
...if you're really certain
you want to retain custody...

726
00:54:53,144 --> 00:54:57,535
...then we'll go in there
and beat the pants off them. Okay?

727
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:18,974
I love you, Billy. I know you're
sleeping and can't hear me.

728
00:55:19,224 --> 00:55:21,533
I love you with all my heart.

729
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:40,137
Ted, you got a lunch?

730
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:44,576
Hi, Jim. I don't know. I was trying
to work this idea out here...

731
00:55:44,824 --> 00:55:47,019
Good. I'll pick you up at 1:00.

732
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,493
Okay, you got it.

733
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:53,142
So the other morning,
I'm at the refrigerator...

734
00:55:53,904 --> 00:55:56,054
...getting Billy ready for school.

735
00:55:56,304 --> 00:55:59,580
I'm just in my underwear
and he notices I've lost weight.

736
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:02,179
He comes in and pats me.
He comes to here.

737
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:06,178
And he says, " Daddy, you've really
lost a lot of weight."

738
00:56:06,424 --> 00:56:10,212
He looks up at me and he says,
"And it's all gone to your nose."

739
00:56:12,424 --> 00:56:14,176
He was so cute. You know?

740
00:56:14,424 --> 00:56:15,334
You know, kids.

741
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:17,461
It's delicious, want a taste?

742
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:19,342
- I'm full.
- It's good.

743
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,381
Listen, Ted...

744
00:56:21,624 --> 00:56:26,140
...I had a call from a friend
of mine over at another agency.

745
00:56:27,224 --> 00:56:30,580
The Mid-Atlantic people have
invited them to pitch the account.

746
00:56:30,824 --> 00:56:31,813
Why?

747
00:56:32,024 --> 00:56:34,333
They're not happy
with what we're doing.

748
00:56:35,544 --> 00:56:38,934
I think you should have them over
and I'll give a little tap dance.

749
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:41,981
I got Norman working on it.

750
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:43,737
Norman?

751
00:56:46,544 --> 00:56:48,739
You taking me off the account?

752
00:56:50,704 --> 00:56:52,057
You don't like me anymore?

753
00:56:52,344 --> 00:56:54,141
It's not quite that simple.

754
00:56:56,824 --> 00:56:59,577
I think we're gonna have to
make a few changes here.

755
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:05,176
You're firing me?

756
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,940
Yeah, I'm letting you go, yes.

757
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:13,020
Why?

758
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:16,375
Now, look, Ted, this is
a very painful thing for me.

759
00:57:16,624 --> 00:57:20,537
I've been getting a lot of pressure
from the guys upstairs.

760
00:57:20,744 --> 00:57:22,541
There wasn't anything I could do.

761
00:57:22,784 --> 00:57:24,934
I think it's better this way.

762
00:57:25,144 --> 00:57:26,259
If I took your stripes...

763
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:31,100
...if I put you on a schlock account,
you'd hate it, and me for doing it.

764
00:57:31,344 --> 00:57:34,097
This way it's a clean break.
That's the best thing.

765
00:57:34,424 --> 00:57:36,858
You know my wife is fighting
for custody?

766
00:57:37,104 --> 00:57:39,334
You know that we're going to court?

767
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:42,775
Do you know what my chances are
if I'm out of a job?

768
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:45,460
I understand that you're upset...

769
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:49,333
I don't want to beg, but I'm
asking you, please, as a friend.

770
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,737
I'm asking you.

771
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:55,380
You're an extremely bright guy.
You've got a hell of a talent.

772
00:57:55,624 --> 00:57:59,333
You're gonna land on your feet.
You're gonna survive.

773
00:57:59,624 --> 00:58:01,137
Teddy, look.

774
00:58:02,504 --> 00:58:04,540
I know you may be short on cash.

775
00:58:04,784 --> 00:58:07,139
No big hurry about paying this back.

776
00:58:07,504 --> 00:58:09,142
Shame on you.

777
00:58:59,544 --> 00:59:01,739
Daddy, the phone's ringing.

778
00:59:02,624 --> 00:59:03,739
- Mr. Kramer?
- Yes.

779
00:59:03,944 --> 00:59:05,980
- Hold on for Mr. Shaunessy.
- Ted.

780
00:59:06,224 --> 00:59:07,782
John. What's happening?

781
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:11,699
They set the court date.
I just heard today it's January 9th.

782
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:15,533
I gotta tell you something.
I got fired today. They laid me off.

783
00:59:18,424 --> 00:59:21,257
Yeah, I'm still here.
Ted, I won't lie to you.

784
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:24,940
We don't have a hope of winning
if you're out of work.

785
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:28,299
Yeah, listen, you tell that...

786
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:31,976
You tell that party and you tell
that party's attorney...

787
00:59:32,224 --> 00:59:33,498
...that I want a delay.

788
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:35,382
Sorry, it's really too late.

789
00:59:36,024 --> 00:59:38,379
- Fine. I'll have a job in 24 hours.
- How?

790
00:59:38,624 --> 00:59:40,421
I'll have a job in 24 hours.

791
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:11,578
This is the worst time
to look for work.

792
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:15,260
It's the holidays. We'll have
something for you by mid-February.

793
01:00:15,504 --> 01:00:17,654
- March, at the latest.
- I can't wait.

794
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:20,464
Mr. Kramer, it's December 22.

795
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:23,258
If you could just look
in your card catalogue.

796
01:00:28,184 --> 01:00:29,936
I'll take anything.

797
01:00:32,904 --> 01:00:35,941
There might be something
at Norman, Craig and Kummel.

798
01:00:36,144 --> 01:00:37,816
What is it?

799
01:00:38,064 --> 01:00:39,656
Something in the art department.

800
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:41,132
You'd go back on the board.

801
01:00:41,344 --> 01:00:44,575
It's really a step down,
and a cut in salary of 5000.

802
01:00:44,824 --> 01:00:46,382
You'll be happier if you wait.

803
01:00:46,624 --> 01:00:50,378
Call them up, make an appointment
for me today at 4:00.

804
01:00:50,624 --> 01:00:52,137
It's the Friday before Christmas.

805
01:00:52,384 --> 01:00:53,578
It's still a workday.

806
01:00:54,024 --> 01:00:55,537
Nobody's gonna want to...

807
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:57,376
Either you call them or I do.

808
01:00:57,624 --> 01:01:00,775
If I call them up, you don't get
a commission. Right?

809
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,140
My, we are a hotshot, aren't we?

810
01:01:05,384 --> 01:01:06,373
Yes, we are.

811
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:15,741
- Good afternoon.
- I'm Kramer. I have an appointment.

812
01:01:16,784 --> 01:01:18,740
I did all of the copy on that one.

813
01:01:21,704 --> 01:01:24,502
That was the most successful
ad campaign they ever had.

814
01:01:24,704 --> 01:01:28,140
I did the idea, the layout
and most of the copy on that one.

815
01:01:29,544 --> 01:01:32,536
Mr. Kramer, I must say,
this is very impressive.

816
01:01:33,104 --> 01:01:34,662
I'd like to get back to you.

817
01:01:34,904 --> 01:01:38,340
Is there someone I should see
before you come to your decision?

818
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,781
Mr. Spencer, our creative director.

819
01:01:41,024 --> 01:01:42,935
Why don't you let me see him now?

820
01:01:43,584 --> 01:01:48,135
He's leaving on vacation. I'll set
something up the moment he gets back.

821
01:01:48,344 --> 01:01:50,141
- I think...
- Have a nice holiday.

822
01:01:50,384 --> 01:01:52,944
I'd like to see him before he leaves.

823
01:01:54,024 --> 01:01:57,255
- Mr. Kramer, I don't...
- I want this position very much.

824
01:02:00,264 --> 01:02:01,174
Wait here.

825
01:02:30,784 --> 01:02:32,342
Mr. Kramer, Mr. Spencer.

826
01:02:32,584 --> 01:02:34,495
- How do you do?
- You got 10 minutes.

827
01:02:37,384 --> 01:02:41,935
You do understand that the salary is
$4800 less than you were making?

828
01:02:42,184 --> 01:02:43,583
Yes, I understand.

829
01:02:43,824 --> 01:02:47,533
Why are you interested in a position
for which you're overqualified?

830
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:49,019
I need the job.

831
01:02:49,824 --> 01:02:53,134
Let me think. I'll let Jack know
and he'll get in touch with you.

832
01:02:53,624 --> 01:02:55,023
This is a one-day offer.

833
01:02:55,224 --> 01:02:58,296
You saw my book,
you know I can handle the work.

834
01:02:58,544 --> 01:03:02,457
You're gonna have to let me know today,
not at the end of the holidays.

835
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:05,298
If you want me,
make a decision right now.

836
01:03:11,944 --> 01:03:14,174
Could we talk privately for a moment?

837
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:15,539
Yes, sir.

838
01:04:00,064 --> 01:04:04,455
Mr. Kramer, you got yourself a job.
Congratulations.

839
01:04:04,704 --> 01:04:05,932
Really?

840
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:09,780
- Is he kidding?
- Welcome aboard.

841
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:12,663
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thanks.

842
01:04:30,584 --> 01:04:31,937
Merry Christmas.

843
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:45,933
Come on.

844
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:52,374
- What do you think?
- It's neat.

845
01:04:52,624 --> 01:04:54,854
- I told you.
- Where is everybody?

846
01:04:55,104 --> 01:04:59,541
It's Saturday, so very few people
come in because it's a day off.

847
01:04:59,984 --> 01:05:01,542
Okay, push " up."

848
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:06,940
Push the top button.
Very top button.

849
01:05:07,184 --> 01:05:08,537
Go ahead, jump.

850
01:05:12,024 --> 01:05:13,173
- Look at that!
- Neat!

851
01:05:13,384 --> 01:05:14,783
You didn't know you were so high.

852
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:17,663
What building is that?
That has the pointy top.

853
01:05:17,904 --> 01:05:19,337
That's the Chrysler.

854
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:21,336
You proud of me?

855
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,778
How'd you get this job?

856
01:05:23,024 --> 01:05:25,936
I told them I wanted it.
What's that say?

857
01:05:26,144 --> 01:05:27,133
It says " Kramer."

858
01:05:27,384 --> 01:05:29,261
Kramer. Who's that?

859
01:05:29,504 --> 01:05:31,381
- That's us.
- That's right.

860
01:05:31,624 --> 01:05:32,943
You want to see?

861
01:05:34,624 --> 01:05:36,535
Wow!

862
01:05:37,704 --> 01:05:40,343
- This is neat.
- You like it?

863
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:42,053
Careful, careful.

864
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:43,373
- I'm okay.
- Scare me.

865
01:05:43,624 --> 01:05:45,137
What's that building?

866
01:05:45,344 --> 01:05:47,983
That's the U.N. building.
That's the East River.

867
01:05:48,224 --> 01:05:50,021
Look across there. You see that?

868
01:05:50,224 --> 01:05:52,784
That's Queens.
Look way, way down there.

869
01:05:53,024 --> 01:05:54,343
- Know what that is?
- What?

870
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:57,183
- Brooklyn.
- Where you lived when you were a kid?

871
01:05:57,424 --> 01:06:00,143
That's right,
and this is where I work.

872
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:04,135
Is this really your desk?

873
01:06:07,184 --> 01:06:08,936
Are you gonna get remarried?

874
01:06:09,144 --> 01:06:11,135
I hadn't thought about it.

875
01:06:11,624 --> 01:06:13,580
Are you gonna marry Phyllis?

876
01:06:13,784 --> 01:06:15,740
No, we're just good friends.

877
01:06:19,384 --> 01:06:21,944
Are you and Mom ever
gonna get remarried?

878
01:06:22,824 --> 01:06:25,338
No, Mommy and me will never
be remarried.

879
01:06:25,824 --> 01:06:28,941
I bet if she saw this,
she'd remarry you.

880
01:06:31,064 --> 01:06:33,180
You're a con artist. We made a deal.

881
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,380
You take a bath every night...

882
01:06:36,624 --> 01:06:39,536
...and you wash that filthy hair
twice a week, right?

883
01:06:39,984 --> 01:06:40,780
- Right?
- Yeah.

884
01:06:41,024 --> 01:06:42,173
Okay.

885
01:06:42,424 --> 01:06:43,743
Promise, or you're not going.

886
01:06:44,224 --> 01:06:46,784
Did I have to
when Mommy was here?

887
01:06:47,024 --> 01:06:49,538
I don't care what you had
to do when Mommy...

888
01:06:51,304 --> 01:06:54,341
Did l, Dad? Did I?

889
01:06:56,384 --> 01:06:57,578
Are you listening?

890
01:06:57,824 --> 01:07:00,543
We'll talk about it tonight
when I get home, okay?

891
01:07:00,744 --> 01:07:02,336
Come here, give me a kiss.

892
01:07:03,304 --> 01:07:05,534
- What?
- You're a terrific kid.

893
01:07:11,584 --> 01:07:13,381
He says, "There's the unicorn."

894
01:07:13,624 --> 01:07:16,184
And he goes underneath there,
and he says:

895
01:07:16,424 --> 01:07:18,540
" Crumbs, what's happening?

896
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,342
The air supply has stopped.

897
01:07:20,584 --> 01:07:23,052
Thundering typhoons,
what are you doing?"

898
01:07:23,304 --> 01:07:25,534
" Resting. It's tiring work,
you know."

899
01:07:25,744 --> 01:07:27,177
What's the air supply?

900
01:07:27,424 --> 01:07:30,734
When you got two tanks on your back
and you can't get any air...

901
01:07:30,944 --> 01:07:33,060
...you can drown,
so he's gotta have that.

902
01:07:33,304 --> 01:07:34,498
Ted, John Shaunessy.

903
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:35,693
Hi, what's up?

904
01:07:35,904 --> 01:07:39,943
I got a call from your wife's lawyer.
She wants to see the kid.

905
01:07:40,304 --> 01:07:42,534
- She wants what?
- She's the mother.

906
01:07:42,784 --> 01:07:44,775
She's within her legal rights.

907
01:07:45,024 --> 01:07:49,063
- How do I know she won't kidnap him?
- I don't think she'd bother...

908
01:07:49,304 --> 01:07:51,454
...suing if she's gonna kidnap him.

909
01:07:52,224 --> 01:07:54,977
Wait. I'm not so sure
about her mental health.

910
01:07:55,224 --> 01:07:58,341
- What do you mean?
- She said she was seeing a shrink.

911
01:07:58,544 --> 01:07:59,533
A psychiatrist.

912
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,137
Did you see her talk to walls?

913
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:02,857
I'm just saying, you know.

914
01:08:03,104 --> 01:08:05,334
I'm just saying you don't
have a choice.

915
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:08,815
Have Billy at the boat pond
in Central Park, Saturday at 10.

916
01:08:09,064 --> 01:08:11,100
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

917
01:08:12,144 --> 01:08:13,543
Thanks very much.

918
01:08:14,744 --> 01:08:17,941
Daddy, will you come on
and finish the story?

919
01:08:19,024 --> 01:08:21,140
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

920
01:08:24,744 --> 01:08:27,941
What happens if the guy drowns?
How do they find him?

921
01:08:28,624 --> 01:08:31,821
When you die, there's bubbles
that come up or something.

922
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:33,258
Where did I leave off?

923
01:08:33,504 --> 01:08:35,938
You left off right there.

924
01:08:36,144 --> 01:08:37,702
"Thundering typhoons..."

925
01:08:40,304 --> 01:08:42,374
It's got an obstacle course and stuff.

926
01:08:42,624 --> 01:08:44,740
- The cars go really fast.
- How much?

927
01:08:44,944 --> 01:08:46,013
It's really neat.

928
01:08:46,224 --> 01:08:47,577
It's neat.

929
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:50,943
- Come here, I want you to look...
- Okay, okay.

930
01:09:05,704 --> 01:09:07,934
I'll have him back by 6.

931
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:10,178
You got so handsome.

932
01:10:04,344 --> 01:10:08,622
Remember, we talked about it,
keep your answers short and succinct.

933
01:10:08,864 --> 01:10:12,140
Just tell the truth and it'll be
all right. Believe me.

934
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:17,092
- She's here.
- Yeah, I know. I saw her.

935
01:10:17,304 --> 01:10:20,979
Whatever you do, try not to become
emotional, no matter what he says.

936
01:10:21,224 --> 01:10:24,660
You'll hear things that may upset you.
I don't want you to react.

937
01:10:25,104 --> 01:10:29,063
Persons having business with the
Supreme Court, State of New York...

938
01:10:29,304 --> 01:10:32,535
...special term part five,
draw nigh and ye shall be heard.

939
01:10:32,784 --> 01:10:37,335
This court is now in session.
Judge Atkins presiding. All rise.

940
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:56,980
- Is the petitioner's attorney ready?
- I am, Your Honour.

941
01:10:57,224 --> 01:10:59,260
I would like to call Joanna Kramer.

942
01:10:59,504 --> 01:11:01,176
Motherhood, going for the throat.

943
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:04,222
You swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

944
01:11:04,464 --> 01:11:05,738
I do.

945
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:15,783
Now, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell
the court how long you were married?

946
01:11:16,024 --> 01:11:17,139
Eight years.

947
01:11:17,384 --> 01:11:20,535
And would you describe those years
as happy?

948
01:11:20,904 --> 01:11:22,895
The first two, yes.

949
01:11:23,224 --> 01:11:26,534
But after that it became
increasingly difficult.

950
01:11:27,424 --> 01:11:31,576
Mrs. Kramer, did you hold a job
before you were married?

951
01:11:31,824 --> 01:11:35,180
Yes, I did.
When I first got out of Smith...

952
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:40,259
...I worked in the art department of
Mademoiselle magazine for years.

953
01:11:41,104 --> 01:11:44,540
Did you continue to work
after you were married?

954
01:11:44,744 --> 01:11:46,780
No. I did not.

955
01:11:47,024 --> 01:11:48,377
Did you wish to?

956
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:53,334
Yes, but every time I talked to Ted...

957
01:11:53,544 --> 01:11:58,140
To my ex-husband about it,
he wouldn't listen.

958
01:11:58,384 --> 01:12:02,741
He refused to discuss it
in any serious way.

959
01:12:03,104 --> 01:12:05,538
He said that I
probably couldn't get a job...

960
01:12:05,744 --> 01:12:08,258
...that would pay enough
to hire a babysitter.

961
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:11,337
Tell me, are you employed
at the present time?

962
01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:13,973
I'm a sportswear designer
here in New York.

963
01:12:14,224 --> 01:12:16,579
And what is your present salary?

964
01:12:16,824 --> 01:12:19,338
I make $31,000 a year.

965
01:12:19,744 --> 01:12:23,134
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?

966
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:26,339
Yes, I do, very much.

967
01:12:26,624 --> 01:12:29,343
And yet you chose to leave him.

968
01:12:30,224 --> 01:12:31,543
Yes.

969
01:12:37,504 --> 01:12:40,940
During the last five years
of our marriage...

970
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:45,058
...I was becoming more
and more unhappy.

971
01:12:45,704 --> 01:12:47,057
More and more troubled.

972
01:12:47,304 --> 01:12:51,138
And I really needed
somebody to help me...

973
01:12:51,384 --> 01:12:54,342
...but when I turned to Ted, he just...

974
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,340
...wasn't there for me.

975
01:12:57,944 --> 01:13:00,583
So we became more isolated
from one another...

976
01:13:00,824 --> 01:13:02,542
...more and more separate.

977
01:13:03,224 --> 01:13:05,738
He was very involved in his career.

978
01:13:06,824 --> 01:13:10,783
And because of his attitude
towards my fears...

979
01:13:11,024 --> 01:13:14,334
...and his inability
to deal with my feelings...

980
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:17,859
...I had come to have
almost no self-esteem.

981
01:13:19,304 --> 01:13:21,898
I was scared and I was very unhappy.

982
01:13:22,104 --> 01:13:24,493
In my mind I had no choice
but to leave.

983
01:13:26,304 --> 01:13:30,934
At the time I left, I felt that
there was something wrong with me...

984
01:13:31,424 --> 01:13:34,143
...and that my son would be
better off without me.

985
01:13:35,824 --> 01:13:39,976
And it was only after I got
to California that I realized...

986
01:13:40,224 --> 01:13:44,137
...after getting into therapy,
that I wasn't a terrible person.

987
01:13:46,784 --> 01:13:51,141
And just because I needed some kind
of creative or emotional outlet...

988
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:54,456
...other than my child,
that didn't make me unfit.

989
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:59,132
I would like to submit in evidence
a report by Mrs. Kramer's therapist...

990
01:13:59,344 --> 01:14:00,823
...Dr. Eleanor Freedman.

991
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:02,139
Objection, Your Honour.

992
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:05,740
The report is irrelevant
and not binding on the respondent.

993
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,013
Overruled.

994
01:14:08,424 --> 01:14:11,939
Can you tell the court why
you are asking for custody?

995
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:15,740
Because he's my child...

996
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:18,414
...and because I love him.

997
01:14:19,904 --> 01:14:21,940
I know I left my son.

998
01:14:23,224 --> 01:14:25,943
I know that
that's a terrible thing to do.

999
01:14:29,304 --> 01:14:32,740
Believe me, I have to live with that
every day of my life.

1000
01:14:33,224 --> 01:14:35,340
But in order to leave him...

1001
01:14:35,984 --> 01:14:39,135
...I had to believe it was
the only thing I could do...

1002
01:14:40,984 --> 01:14:43,179
...and that it was
the best thing for him.

1003
01:14:43,424 --> 01:14:45,984
I was incapable of functioning
in that home.

1004
01:14:46,224 --> 01:14:48,135
And I didn't know...

1005
01:14:48,344 --> 01:14:50,539
...what the alternative was...

1006
01:14:50,744 --> 01:14:53,861
...so I thought it was not best
that I take him with me.

1007
01:14:54,104 --> 01:14:57,540
However, I have since
gotten some help...

1008
01:14:57,824 --> 01:15:02,136
...and I have worked very, very hard
to become a whole human being.

1009
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:07,344
I don't think I should be
punished for that.

1010
01:15:08,944 --> 01:15:11,742
I don't think my little boy
should be punished.

1011
01:15:12,184 --> 01:15:14,334
Billy's only 7 years old.

1012
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:16,737
He needs me.

1013
01:15:17,624 --> 01:15:20,343
I'm not saying he doesn't
need his father...

1014
01:15:21,544 --> 01:15:24,138
...but I really believe
he needs me more.

1015
01:15:25,944 --> 01:15:30,142
I was his mommy
for five and a half years...

1016
01:15:31,024 --> 01:15:34,937
...and Ted took over that role
for 18 months.

1017
01:15:39,104 --> 01:15:41,857
But I don't know how anybody
can possibly believe...

1018
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:45,983
...that I have less of a stake
in mothering that little boy...

1019
01:15:46,224 --> 01:15:48,340
...than Mr. Kramer does.

1020
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:53,142
I'm his mother.

1021
01:15:55,504 --> 01:15:57,142
I'm his mother.

1022
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:03,339
Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.

1023
01:16:03,744 --> 01:16:05,735
I have no further questions.

1024
01:16:07,744 --> 01:16:10,133
Now then, Mrs. Kramer...

1025
01:16:10,944 --> 01:16:15,335
...you say that you were married
for eight years, is that correct?

1026
01:16:17,384 --> 01:16:22,299
In all that time did your husband ever
strike you or physically abuse you?

1027
01:16:23,424 --> 01:16:24,618
No.

1028
01:16:24,824 --> 01:16:29,534
Did he ever strike or physically
abuse his child in any way?

1029
01:16:30,984 --> 01:16:33,942
Would you describe your husband
as an alcoholic?

1030
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:36,737
A heavy drinker?

1031
01:16:37,624 --> 01:16:39,342
Was he unfaithful?

1032
01:16:46,424 --> 01:16:49,336
Did he ever fail
to provide for you in any way?

1033
01:16:51,744 --> 01:16:54,099
I can certainly see why you left him.

1034
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:55,743
Objection.

1035
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,737
How long do you plan to live
in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

1036
01:17:01,144 --> 01:17:02,543
Permanently.

1037
01:17:04,224 --> 01:17:07,022
How many boyfriends have you had,
permanently?

1038
01:17:07,264 --> 01:17:09,380
Objection on grounds of vagueness.

1039
01:17:09,624 --> 01:17:10,943
I'll allow it.

1040
01:17:14,904 --> 01:17:15,939
I don't recall.

1041
01:17:16,344 --> 01:17:18,733
More than three, less than 33,
permanently?

1042
01:17:18,984 --> 01:17:20,212
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1043
01:17:20,464 --> 01:17:22,534
The witness will answer, please.

1044
01:17:24,584 --> 01:17:26,176
Somewhere in between.

1045
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:27,937
Do you have a lover now?

1046
01:17:31,784 --> 01:17:35,379
Your Honour, I would request a direct
answer to a direct question.

1047
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:37,342
Does she have a lover?

1048
01:17:37,584 --> 01:17:41,133
I'll allow that.
The witness will answer, please.

1049
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,940
Yes, I'm seeing someone now.

1050
01:17:45,184 --> 01:17:47,823
Is that... permanent?

1051
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:50,579
I don't know.

1052
01:17:50,824 --> 01:17:53,258
We don't know
when you say permanently...

1053
01:17:53,504 --> 01:17:57,577
...if you plan to live in New York,
or keep your child, for that matter...

1054
01:17:57,824 --> 01:18:02,420
...since you've never done anything
that could be regarded as permanent.

1055
01:18:02,624 --> 01:18:06,822
Objection. I request the counsel be
prevented from harassing the witness.

1056
01:18:07,064 --> 01:18:08,179
Sustained.

1057
01:18:08,424 --> 01:18:10,733
I'll put it another way, counsellor.

1058
01:18:11,304 --> 01:18:14,853
What was the longest personal
relationship in your life...

1059
01:18:15,064 --> 01:18:17,532
...outside of parents or girlfriends?

1060
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:21,542
I suppose that would be my child.

1061
01:18:22,184 --> 01:18:24,744
Whom you've seen twice in a year.

1062
01:18:24,944 --> 01:18:28,539
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband...

1063
01:18:28,784 --> 01:18:32,333
...wasn't he the longest
personal relationship in your life?

1064
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:37,939
Would you speak up?
I couldn't hear you.

1065
01:18:38,944 --> 01:18:40,138
Yes.

1066
01:18:40,624 --> 01:18:42,137
How long was that?

1067
01:18:43,624 --> 01:18:46,741
We were married a year
before the baby...

1068
01:18:47,424 --> 01:18:48,857
...and seven years after.

1069
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:52,733
So you were a failure at the most
important relationship in your life.

1070
01:18:52,944 --> 01:18:54,502
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1071
01:18:54,744 --> 01:18:57,542
The witness's opinion on this
is relevant.

1072
01:18:58,384 --> 01:19:00,136
I was not a failure.

1073
01:19:00,784 --> 01:19:04,094
What do you call it, a success?
The marriage ended in divorce.

1074
01:19:04,584 --> 01:19:06,939
I consider it less my failure
than his.

1075
01:19:07,144 --> 01:19:08,577
Congratulations.

1076
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:12,499
You've just rewritten matrimonial law.
You were both divorced.

1077
01:19:12,744 --> 01:19:14,143
Objection!

1078
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:18,340
Your Honour, I would like to ask
what this model of stability...

1079
01:19:18,584 --> 01:19:20,779
...and respectability
has ever succeeded at.

1080
01:19:21,344 --> 01:19:26,020
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

1081
01:19:28,144 --> 01:19:33,059
- It did not succeed.
- Not it, Mrs. Kramer, you.

1082
01:19:33,304 --> 01:19:37,661
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

1083
01:19:37,904 --> 01:19:39,337
Were you?!

1084
01:19:44,744 --> 01:19:45,938
No.

1085
01:19:51,104 --> 01:19:52,856
Is that a yes, Mrs. Kramer?

1086
01:20:00,024 --> 01:20:01,742
No further questions.

1087
01:20:05,544 --> 01:20:08,422
- Did you have to be so rough?
- Do you want the kid?

1088
01:20:08,704 --> 01:20:09,898
Daddy?

1089
01:20:10,784 --> 01:20:11,978
Daddy.

1090
01:20:12,304 --> 01:20:15,137
- Yeah?
- What did you do when you were little?

1091
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:16,697
The same things you do.

1092
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:19,293
Did you watch The Brady Bunch?

1093
01:20:19,864 --> 01:20:22,298
No, we didn't have any television.

1094
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,297
You didn't?

1095
01:20:24,544 --> 01:20:26,216
We listened to the radio.

1096
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:27,823
What else didn't you have?

1097
01:20:28,264 --> 01:20:29,936
We didn't have lots of things.

1098
01:20:30,144 --> 01:20:32,100
- Like?
- Like a lot of things.

1099
01:20:33,144 --> 01:20:34,133
What kind?

1100
01:20:37,104 --> 01:20:38,503
Come here.

1101
01:20:39,624 --> 01:20:41,137
We didn't have diet soda.

1102
01:20:41,384 --> 01:20:43,500
We had egg creams, which was
chocolate syrup...

1103
01:20:43,744 --> 01:20:46,099
...seltzer water and a bit of
milk and you went...

1104
01:20:46,464 --> 01:20:49,183
...and you drank it
and it was delicious.

1105
01:20:49,384 --> 01:20:51,773
We didn't have the Mets,
but we had the Brooklyn Dodgers.

1106
01:20:51,984 --> 01:20:54,817
We had the Polo Grounds
and Ebbets Field...

1107
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:56,901
Boy, those were the days.

1108
01:20:57,104 --> 01:20:59,095
We didn't have the Volkswagens...

1109
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:02,774
...but we had all those different cars
with funny names on them.

1110
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:05,293
We didn't have Burger King
or McDonald's.

1111
01:21:05,544 --> 01:21:09,696
We had automats where you put a
quarter in and you'd get...

1112
01:21:09,984 --> 01:21:13,294
...a piece of pie or a sandwich
you could see through a window.

1113
01:21:13,504 --> 01:21:16,337
We didn't have graffiti,
but we had this guy Kilroy...

1114
01:21:16,984 --> 01:21:19,134
Mr. Kramer is a very devoted father.

1115
01:21:19,384 --> 01:21:22,057
He spends a great deal of time
with Billy.

1116
01:21:22,664 --> 01:21:24,177
He reads to Billy a lot.

1117
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:27,899
They play together,
they talk all the time.

1118
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:30,342
He's a wonderful father.

1119
01:21:30,544 --> 01:21:33,297
Thank you.
No further questions.

1120
01:21:33,544 --> 01:21:36,502
Mrs. Phelps, how long
have you known Joanna Kramer?

1121
01:21:36,904 --> 01:21:40,658
About six years, ever since she and
Ted moved into the building.

1122
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:44,300
How often did you see
Joanna Kramer and her son?

1123
01:21:44,784 --> 01:21:48,857
I haven't seen them together now for
about a year and a half, but...

1124
01:21:49,064 --> 01:21:52,101
...back then I saw them two or
three times a week.

1125
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,898
My oldest daughter and Billy
play together.

1126
01:21:55,104 --> 01:21:59,097
Can you describe the relationship
between Joanna Kramer and her son?

1127
01:21:59,304 --> 01:22:00,100
It was good.

1128
01:22:00,744 --> 01:22:02,382
Joanna was a very good mother.

1129
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,575
Both Ted and Joanna are very...

1130
01:22:04,784 --> 01:22:07,901
Did Mrs. Kramer discuss her
relationship with her ex-husband?

1131
01:22:08,584 --> 01:22:09,903
Yes.

1132
01:22:10,144 --> 01:22:12,897
Can you tell the court
exactly what she said?

1133
01:22:14,584 --> 01:22:16,700
Joanna wasn't happy for many reasons...

1134
01:22:16,944 --> 01:22:21,301
Did you ever hear her say Mr. Kramer
was insensitive to his son's needs?

1135
01:22:25,144 --> 01:22:27,499
Would you answer the question?

1136
01:22:28,504 --> 01:22:30,938
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, but that was before...

1137
01:22:31,224 --> 01:22:33,738
Did you ever encourage
her to leave her husband?

1138
01:22:34,184 --> 01:22:35,458
No, I did not.

1139
01:22:38,144 --> 01:22:41,500
Several days before she left,
did you say to her:

1140
01:22:41,744 --> 01:22:45,703
" If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1141
01:22:47,344 --> 01:22:50,063
- I didn't think Joanna...
- Did you say to her:

1142
01:22:50,264 --> 01:22:53,461
" If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1143
01:22:54,744 --> 01:22:57,781
- Yes, but she was my friend...
- No further questions.

1144
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:01,140
Mrs. Phelps, you may step down.

1145
01:23:01,344 --> 01:23:03,858
Joanna, things are not the same now.

1146
01:23:04,264 --> 01:23:05,617
Ted is not the same man.

1147
01:23:05,864 --> 01:23:08,537
- You don't know how hard he's tried...
- Mrs. Phelps!

1148
01:23:08,744 --> 01:23:10,496
They're beautiful together.

1149
01:23:10,784 --> 01:23:12,536
The witness is asked to step down.

1150
01:23:12,744 --> 01:23:14,541
If you could see them together...

1151
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:16,575
...maybe you wouldn't be here now.

1152
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:18,695
Mrs. Phelps, that will be all!

1153
01:23:24,144 --> 01:23:25,497
I'm sorry.

1154
01:23:27,904 --> 01:23:29,178
When you were talking...

1155
01:23:29,944 --> 01:23:34,495
When my ex-wife was talking about how
unhappy she was during our marriage...

1156
01:23:34,704 --> 01:23:37,218
...most of what she said
was probably true.

1157
01:23:37,424 --> 01:23:39,699
There's a lot I didn't understand.

1158
01:23:40,344 --> 01:23:42,904
There's a lot
I'd do different if I could...

1159
01:23:43,264 --> 01:23:46,256
...just like there's a lot you wish
you could change but can't.

1160
01:23:46,464 --> 01:23:49,695
Some things, once they're done,
can't be undone.

1161
01:23:50,784 --> 01:23:52,342
My wife...

1162
01:23:52,664 --> 01:23:57,294
My ex-wife says she loves Billy
and I believe she does.

1163
01:23:58,104 --> 01:24:00,493
But I don't think
that's the issue here.

1164
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:03,495
If I understand it correctly...

1165
01:24:04,384 --> 01:24:07,933
...what means the most here is
what's best for our son.

1166
01:24:08,424 --> 01:24:10,699
What's best for Billy.

1167
01:24:11,744 --> 01:24:13,541
My wife used to say to me:

1168
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:16,861
"Why can't a woman have
the same ambitions as a man?"

1169
01:24:17,384 --> 01:24:18,897
I think you're right.

1170
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:21,300
And maybe I've learned that much.

1171
01:24:21,504 --> 01:24:23,813
By the same token, I'd like to know...

1172
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:28,819
...what law says a woman is a better
parent simply by virtue of her sex?

1173
01:24:29,584 --> 01:24:32,621
I've had time to think about
what makes a good parent.

1174
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:35,657
It has to do with constancy.
It has to do with patience...

1175
01:24:35,864 --> 01:24:37,297
...listening to him...

1176
01:24:37,544 --> 01:24:40,138
...or pretending to listen
when you can't anymore.

1177
01:24:40,384 --> 01:24:43,501
It has to do with love,
like she was saying.

1178
01:24:43,824 --> 01:24:47,533
I don't know where it says a woman
has a corner on that market...

1179
01:24:47,784 --> 01:24:50,901
...that a man has any less
of those emotions than a woman.

1180
01:24:51,144 --> 01:24:54,295
Billy has a home with me.
I've made it the best I could.

1181
01:24:54,544 --> 01:24:57,217
It's not perfect.
I'm not a perfect parent.

1182
01:24:57,464 --> 01:25:02,254
Sometimes I don't have enough patience
and I forget that he's a little kid.

1183
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:03,983
But I'm there.

1184
01:25:05,584 --> 01:25:09,577
We eat breakfast and he talks to me,
and then we go to school.

1185
01:25:09,824 --> 01:25:13,942
At night we have dinner together and
we talk and I read to him and...

1186
01:25:15,184 --> 01:25:18,699
And we built a life together
and we love each other.

1187
01:25:25,424 --> 01:25:27,301
If you destroy that...

1188
01:25:28,824 --> 01:25:31,099
...it may be irreparable.

1189
01:25:38,664 --> 01:25:41,497
Joanna, don't do that, please.

1190
01:25:43,184 --> 01:25:46,301
- Don't do it twice to him.
- Thank you, Mr. Kramer.

1191
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:48,102
No further questions.

1192
01:25:49,864 --> 01:25:52,139
How long have you
worked in advertising?

1193
01:25:52,344 --> 01:25:54,494
Ever since I graduated high school.

1194
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:58,935
College, I mean.
I've been there about 15 years.

1195
01:25:59,184 --> 01:26:03,018
Would you say you've achieved a
certain status in your profession?

1196
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:05,215
Yes, I have a good reputation.

1197
01:26:05,464 --> 01:26:08,934
When you worked at Roth, Kane
and Donovan, what was your salary?

1198
01:26:09,144 --> 01:26:11,180
Around $33,000 dollars a year
when I left.

1199
01:26:11,384 --> 01:26:13,944
Now you work at Norman, Craig
and Kummel?

1200
01:26:14,144 --> 01:26:16,055
- Yes.
- What is your salary?

1201
01:26:16,584 --> 01:26:18,734
It's almost 29,000.

1202
01:26:18,944 --> 01:26:21,253
Could you be more specific?

1203
01:26:21,624 --> 01:26:23,740
I make $28,200.

1204
01:26:24,144 --> 01:26:26,055
28,200.

1205
01:26:26,664 --> 01:26:30,896
You're the only person who's working
his way down the ladder of success.

1206
01:26:31,104 --> 01:26:35,461
Objection. Your Honour, I ask that
counsel's last remark be stricken.

1207
01:26:35,744 --> 01:26:36,620
Sustained.

1208
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:39,338
Is it true you were fired
from your previous job?

1209
01:26:39,584 --> 01:26:44,021
- I was let go.
- Will you tell us why you were let go?

1210
01:26:44,464 --> 01:26:46,614
There was a difference
of opinion in policy.

1211
01:26:46,904 --> 01:26:51,295
Is it true your agency lost a major
account due to your negligence?

1212
01:26:51,744 --> 01:26:52,540
Objection!

1213
01:26:52,744 --> 01:26:55,417
I'm trying to establish
the witness's employment record.

1214
01:26:55,664 --> 01:26:57,894
He cannot hold a job.

1215
01:26:58,144 --> 01:26:59,657
I'll allow it, Mr. Shaunessy.

1216
01:27:00,704 --> 01:27:03,741
It's not unusual in advertising
for a client...

1217
01:27:03,984 --> 01:27:06,100
...to change his mind
and go elsewhere...

1218
01:27:06,944 --> 01:27:10,414
Was it true you walked out on a
client during a major presentation...

1219
01:27:10,784 --> 01:27:13,696
...saying that you had an appointment
with a teacher?

1220
01:27:13,944 --> 01:27:16,902
My son was sitting next to a kid
who was hitting and biting.

1221
01:27:17,144 --> 01:27:19,704
- Yes or no?
- Yes, but he bit my kid.

1222
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:23,943
Last spring, did you miss a deadline
on the Mid-Atlantic account...

1223
01:27:24,144 --> 01:27:26,612
...causing your company a
great deal of embarrassment...

1224
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:28,735
...and considerable
financial liability?

1225
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:31,583
On that day I had to go home
because my child was sick.

1226
01:27:31,824 --> 01:27:34,292
Did you or did you not
miss a deadline?

1227
01:27:34,544 --> 01:27:36,535
- My son was sick.
- Answer the question.

1228
01:27:36,824 --> 01:27:39,896
I'm trying to answer the question.
It's not yes or no.

1229
01:27:40,784 --> 01:27:42,934
- Yes or no?
- He had a 104 temperature!

1230
01:27:43,144 --> 01:27:45,612
He's lying there sweating!
I go home to him!

1231
01:27:46,184 --> 01:27:50,496
Mr. Kramer, I urge you to stop
or I'll have to hold you in contempt.

1232
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:57,862
I missed the deadline.

1233
01:27:58,664 --> 01:28:01,383
- Do you have a violent temper?
- No.

1234
01:28:01,624 --> 01:28:03,455
- Objection.
- I withdraw the question.

1235
01:28:03,704 --> 01:28:06,582
- Do you consider yourself a fit parent?
- Yes, I do.

1236
01:28:06,864 --> 01:28:09,697
Is it true your child nearly lost
an eye while in your care?

1237
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,497
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1238
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:13,103
Answer the question.

1239
01:28:13,384 --> 01:28:15,500
He was in the playground,
on the jungle gym...

1240
01:28:15,784 --> 01:28:18,617
And fell and nearly lost an eye
while in your care.

1241
01:28:18,824 --> 01:28:20,098
He fell and cut himself.

1242
01:28:20,304 --> 01:28:21,862
Is it true you told your ex-wife...

1243
01:28:22,064 --> 01:28:25,579
...you were responsible for the
injury that disfigured your child?

1244
01:28:25,904 --> 01:28:27,053
Did you tell her:

1245
01:28:27,504 --> 01:28:30,701
"When it happened I felt guilty.
I felt it was my fault"?

1246
01:28:30,944 --> 01:28:33,822
- Objection!
- I have concluded my questions.

1247
01:29:08,224 --> 01:29:09,213
Ted?

1248
01:29:10,744 --> 01:29:12,097
Ted?

1249
01:29:16,904 --> 01:29:21,739
I'm sorry. I mentioned the accident
to him two months ago...

1250
01:29:21,944 --> 01:29:24,902
...and I never thought he would
bring it up, never.

1251
01:29:26,384 --> 01:29:27,703
Believe me.

1252
01:29:28,544 --> 01:29:32,696
I never would have mentioned it if
I thought he'd pull a thing like that.

1253
01:29:33,704 --> 01:29:34,898
I'm sorry.

1254
01:29:35,304 --> 01:29:36,498
I'm...

1255
01:29:47,544 --> 01:29:48,499
Ted.

1256
01:29:48,784 --> 01:29:50,740
- Hi.
- Hi. Here, let me help you.

1257
01:29:50,944 --> 01:29:52,138
Heard anything yet?

1258
01:29:52,344 --> 01:29:55,142
Any day. My lawyer says
no news is good news.

1259
01:29:55,384 --> 01:29:56,942
- Guess what.
- What?

1260
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:59,652
Charley and I are talking about
getting back together.

1261
01:29:59,864 --> 01:30:02,424
Really?
Did he finally call you?

1262
01:30:02,664 --> 01:30:04,143
No, I called him.

1263
01:30:04,384 --> 01:30:05,499
How come?

1264
01:30:05,744 --> 01:30:09,737
I don't know. I got to thinking
about a lot of things since the trial.

1265
01:30:09,984 --> 01:30:10,939
And...

1266
01:30:11,664 --> 01:30:14,303
I don't think it'll work out,
but he seems to want it.

1267
01:30:14,544 --> 01:30:17,695
That's terrific.
How do you feel?

1268
01:30:17,904 --> 01:30:21,294
I don't know.
I feel scared, I guess.

1269
01:30:31,144 --> 01:30:32,975
- Hi.
- Hi.

1270
01:30:35,384 --> 01:30:36,578
I lost.

1271
01:30:37,904 --> 01:30:40,099
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1272
01:30:48,664 --> 01:30:49,892
What happened?

1273
01:30:51,184 --> 01:30:54,335
The judge went for motherhood
right down the line.

1274
01:30:55,344 --> 01:30:59,337
"Ordered and decreed that the
petitioner be awarded custody...

1275
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:01,779
...effective Monday,
the 23rd of January...

1276
01:31:02,144 --> 01:31:06,820
...that the respondent pay for the
support of the child, $400 a month.

1277
01:31:07,064 --> 01:31:09,498
The father shall have the
following visitation rights:

1278
01:31:09,784 --> 01:31:13,333
Every other weekend, one night a
week to be mutually agreed upon...

1279
01:31:13,584 --> 01:31:16,303
...and one half of the child's
vacation period."

1280
01:31:16,544 --> 01:31:18,694
- That's it.
- What if I fight it?

1281
01:31:18,904 --> 01:31:20,701
I can't guarantee anything.

1282
01:31:20,904 --> 01:31:22,223
I'll take my chances.

1283
01:31:22,464 --> 01:31:24,694
- It'll cost you.
- I'll pay anything.

1284
01:31:25,384 --> 01:31:27,898
Look, Ted, I have to
tell you something.

1285
01:31:29,184 --> 01:31:31,778
This time it'll be Billy that pays.

1286
01:31:31,984 --> 01:31:34,020
I'll have to put him on the stand.

1287
01:31:34,464 --> 01:31:36,102
I can't do that.

1288
01:31:36,384 --> 01:31:38,295
No, I don't want to do that.

1289
01:31:40,944 --> 01:31:43,617
Thanks very much for your time.
I'm gonna take a walk.

1290
01:31:59,304 --> 01:32:01,693
Ted? It's me.

1291
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,899
Ted?

1292
01:32:08,424 --> 01:32:09,903
I just heard.

1293
01:32:10,304 --> 01:32:11,896
Please go away.

1294
01:32:12,984 --> 01:32:14,895
Are you okay?

1295
01:32:16,384 --> 01:32:19,899
I just have to be by myself
for a while, Margaret.

1296
01:32:27,224 --> 01:32:28,259
I don't understand.

1297
01:32:28,504 --> 01:32:31,337
The problem is your mom and I
both want you to live with us.

1298
01:32:31,544 --> 01:32:35,742
So that's why we decided to go see
this man, who is the judge...

1299
01:32:35,944 --> 01:32:39,220
...and we let him decide because
he's very wise and experienced.

1300
01:32:39,424 --> 01:32:42,939
We talked to him for a few days
and then asked what he thought.

1301
01:32:43,184 --> 01:32:45,379
You know what?
He agreed with Mommy.

1302
01:32:45,584 --> 01:32:49,020
He thought it'd be terrific
if you lived with her from now on.

1303
01:32:49,264 --> 01:32:52,574
I'm lucky because I get to have
dinner with you once a week.

1304
01:32:52,824 --> 01:32:55,702
And twice a month
we spend the weekends together.

1305
01:32:57,184 --> 01:33:00,301
Where's my bed gonna be?
Where am I gonna sleep?

1306
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:04,543
Mommy's figured that all out. You
have your own bedroom at her place.

1307
01:33:05,984 --> 01:33:08,373
- Where will all my toys be?
- At Mommy's.

1308
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:10,734
We're gonna take
all your toys over there.

1309
01:33:10,944 --> 01:33:13,902
If you play your cards right,
she'll buy you some new ones.

1310
01:33:14,984 --> 01:33:17,179
Who's gonna read me
my bedtime stories?

1311
01:33:17,584 --> 01:33:19,097
Mommy will.

1312
01:33:19,784 --> 01:33:22,139
You're not gonna kiss me
good night anymore?

1313
01:33:22,384 --> 01:33:24,579
No, I won't be able to do that.

1314
01:33:24,784 --> 01:33:28,094
But, you know, I get to visit.

1315
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,972
It's gonna be okay. Really.

1316
01:33:33,184 --> 01:33:35,539
If I don't like it, can I come home?

1317
01:33:35,784 --> 01:33:37,297
What do you mean?

1318
01:33:37,504 --> 01:33:39,620
You'll have a great time with Mommy.

1319
01:33:39,824 --> 01:33:42,099
Really. She loves you so much.

1320
01:33:42,584 --> 01:33:43,903
Dad?

1321
01:33:44,904 --> 01:33:48,294
Don't forget, once, if you can
just call me up, okay?

1322
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:56,301
We're gonna be okay.

1323
01:34:00,944 --> 01:34:02,980
Let's go get some ice cream.

1324
01:35:38,544 --> 01:35:41,297
Come on, let's get
this show on the road.

1325
01:35:43,264 --> 01:35:45,141
Let's get a little hustle now, okay?

1326
01:35:45,344 --> 01:35:47,062
Come on, set the table.

1327
01:35:55,384 --> 01:35:56,499
Come on.

1328
01:36:07,744 --> 01:36:09,097
Are you ready?

1329
01:36:26,784 --> 01:36:27,580
Yes?

1330
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,292
It's Joanna.
I'm downstairs in the lobby.

1331
01:36:30,504 --> 01:36:32,893
Can you come down here
and meet me alone?

1332
01:36:39,664 --> 01:36:40,619
Hi.

1333
01:36:41,944 --> 01:36:43,093
What's up?

1334
01:36:47,344 --> 01:36:49,494
Tell me. What?
What's the matter?

1335
01:36:50,184 --> 01:36:52,095
I woke up this morning.

1336
01:36:55,864 --> 01:36:57,695
Kept thinking about Billy...

1337
01:36:57,944 --> 01:37:00,777
...and I was thinking about
him waking up in his room...

1338
01:37:00,984 --> 01:37:03,657
...with his little clouds
all around that I painted...

1339
01:37:03,904 --> 01:37:08,455
...and I thought I should have
painted clouds downtown because...

1340
01:37:10,064 --> 01:37:13,500
...then he would think that
he was waking up at home.

1341
01:37:16,624 --> 01:37:19,696
I came here to take my son home.

1342
01:37:23,784 --> 01:37:26,093
And I realized he already is home.

1343
01:37:32,224 --> 01:37:34,499
I love him very much.

1344
01:37:39,704 --> 01:37:41,899
I'm not gonna take him with me.

1345
01:37:50,424 --> 01:37:53,222
Can I go up and talk to him?

1346
01:37:53,504 --> 01:37:54,619
Yeah.

1347
01:38:02,384 --> 01:38:05,694
Why don't you go upstairs
and see him and I'll wait here.

1348
01:38:16,584 --> 01:38:18,097
How do I look?

1349
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,099
Terrific.

1350
01:40:28,464 --> 01:40:29,453
