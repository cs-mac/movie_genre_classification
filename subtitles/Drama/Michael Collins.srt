1
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:11,293
You've got to think of him the way he was.

2
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:13,366
He cycled around Dublin...

3
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:16,490
...in his pin-striped suit with
£10,000 on his head.

4
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:18,804
'Why hide, Joe,' he'd say...

5
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,964
'...when that's what they expect?'

6
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:23,568
But he never did what anyone expected.

7
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:26,924
He got the British out of here,
and no one expected that.

8
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:31,931
Some people are what the times demand...

9
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:34,527
...and life without them seems impossible.

10
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:36,326
But he's dead.

11
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:38,644
And life is possible.

12
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:40,485
He made it possible.

13
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:05,606
Fire!

14
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:44,965
Cease firing!

15
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,885
Cease firing!

16
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:50,886
Move forward!

17
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:53,927
Come forward!

18
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:02,806
Keep your hands in the air and your
weapons visible at all times.

19
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:05,524
Form up, in three columns...

20
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,366
...across the square.

21
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,925
Now, ground your arms.

22
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:11,845
Take three paces back...

23
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:13,207
...slowly.

24
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:18,572
Move three paces back, now!

25
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:22,892
The game's over, Harry. We lost again.

26
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:28,165
Quick...march!

27
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:40,532
Pick your feet up!

28
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:44,004
Move it, you Fenian bastard!

29
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,485
Open the gates!

30
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:11,053
Show me the ringleaders
of this little farce.

31
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:17,606
Pearse...

32
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,925
...with the gunner eye.

33
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,288
McDonagh.

34
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:28,806
Thomas Clarke.

35
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,127
Connolly.

36
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:37,925
Get up, you Fenian swine.

37
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:40,322
Wait, Michael. Wait.

38
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:41,528
Till when?

39
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:43,251
Till the next time.

40
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:54,246
Eamon de Valera.

41
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:05,285
What happens next time?

42
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:08,729
We won't play by their rules.
We'll invent our own.

43
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:09,848
Fire!

Don't you see a certain paradox in that?

80
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:31,926
Paradox.

81
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:33,606
A contradiction.

82
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:38,327
An immovable force meets an
immovable object kind of thing.

83
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,922
Look, isn't that a lovely picture?

84
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,404
Maybe we should settle down.

85
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,085
Just the two of us?

86
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,288
And him.

87
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:19,368
Who?

88
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,327
How are you?

89
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:28,324
How long has that man been there?

90
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:31,052
As long as we have. Half an hour or so.

91
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,566
How'd they know we were coming?

92
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:36,245
They know what we ate for breakfast.

93
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,722
There's only one way to beat them, then.

94
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:41,043
Find out what they eat for breakfast.

95
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:47,849
Fuck.

96
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:49,446
lt's market day.

97
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,012
Where are you going?

98
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:00,963
So, what did you have for breakfast?

99
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:03,931
A traffic jam, lads.
lf you backed up, we could back up...

100
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:05,844
...and you could chase us some more.

101
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,652
lf we sit here a minute, it'll sort itself out.

102
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,166
Grand so.

103
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:27,770
The fact that the candidate
you're being asked to vote for...

104
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:31,766
...is at this moment rotting in an
English jail shouldn't put you off!

105
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,732
l was in one myself till a week ago!

106
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,446
They can jail us.

107
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:38,966
They can shoot us.

108
00:09:39,853 --> 00:09:41,923
They can even conscript us!

109
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:46,169
They can use us as cannon
fodder in the Somme!

110
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:48,808
But...

111
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,282
...we have a weapon more powerful...

112
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:54,889
...than any in the whole
arsenal of the British Empire!

113
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,247
That weapon...

114
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,244
...is our refusal!

115
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:02,489
Our refusal to bow to
any order but our own!

116
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,602
Any institution but our own!

117
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,487
Our friends in the Royal lrish
Constabulary want to shut me up.

118
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,972
Jail me again, shoot me, who knows?

119
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:20,253
But l'd like you to send them a message!

120
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:23,531
lf they shut me up,
who'll take my place?

121
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:26,646
Who'll take my place?

122
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,246
We will!

123
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:31,212
l can't hear you! Who'll take my place?

124
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:33,604
Will they shut you up?

125
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:43,528
Clear a path!

126
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:44,887
Clear a path!

127
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:47,408
Get him out! Go, get him out!

128
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,524
So, what's your name?

129
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:02,648
Kitty.

130
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,807
ls Harry here?

131
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:06,565
Downstairs.

132
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,764
What did they hit you with?

133
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:11,924
Whatever it was, it was hard.

134
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:18,483
-You'll be all right.
-You're a nurse, Kitty?

135
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:19,688
l'm nothing.

136
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,005
l'm my father's daughter.

137
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,208
Who's your father?

138
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:24,408
He's dead.

139
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:28,971
There's dinner in an hour,
if you fancy it.

140
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,407
Grand so.

141
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:34,811

Mick's about to make another speech.

What are you saying, you Dublin jackeen?

153
00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:17,767
What would you know about singing?

154

l agree, you West Cork muck savage.

155

You're the expert in singing.

157

Come on, Mick. Give us a song.

165
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:43,125
He hasn't a note in his head.

166

'Why l left old Skibereen'

172
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:06,691
Twelve more verses, now.

173
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,805
You wanted to be woken.

174
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:33,365
There was a man in West Cork
who proposed to five sisters...

175
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,925
...one after the other.

176
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,404
l suppose they all refused.

177
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:41,531
Then the father died,
and he proposed to the mother.

178
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:45,123
Are you trying to tell me something?

179
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:48,092
l was building up to a proposal.

180
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:50,721
lt's not easy with a Fenian in your bed.

181
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:54,325
-He likes you too.
-l do?

182
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:55,448
Stop it.

183
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,603
-But, sadly, he snores.
-l do not.

184
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,365
So it's up to you, Kitty.

185
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,450
-l don't have to like either.
-Never was a truer word spoken.

186
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,603
And he sleeps in his trousers.

187
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:09,365
Forgive the brute.

188
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:11,129
Morning.

189
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:12,202
Morning.

190
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:13,767
Behave yourself.

191
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,207
Am l dreaming?

192
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:16,647
l think you are.

193
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,527
We'll be an invisible army.

194
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:25,049
Our uniform will be that of the man
on the street, the peasant in the field.

195
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:28,330
We'll strike the enemy
and vanish back in the crowd again.

196
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,006
What do we strike with?

197
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:31,492
What have you got?

198
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:35,688
Show me.

199
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:37,684
Jeez, look at this, Harry.

200
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,242
Same old story.
You need something better.

201
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,846
Where's the police barracks?

202
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:44,652
-Two miles down the road.
-There is an arsenal.

203
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,804
How do we get in? We have no bullets!

204
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,406
They don't know that.

205
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,002
What's that?

206
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,641
-A sod of turf.
-Wrong. That's a weapon.

207
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:56,248
Fucking deadly.

208
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,846
You don't believe me?

209
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:05,686
What is it now?

210
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:31,686
Good evening, lads.

211
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:33,446
Hands in the air.

212
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,171
-Drop your weapons!
-Now!

213
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,611
We'll relieve you of your responsibilities.

214
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,364
Grab that bag, one of youse.

215
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:52,322
Jesus, lads, it's Christmas.

216
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:59,602
You'll be organized in flying columns.

217
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:02,207
Fight on your own terms.
What's your name?

218
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:03,846
-Whose terms, Pat?
-Ours.

219
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:06,242
l want each of those to capture ten more.

220
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,370
And l want you to account for every bullet,
understand?

221
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:10,728
Stand up!

222
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,164
-You understand?
-Yes, sir!

223
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:17,883
l'll make a fucking army out of you
if it's the last thing l do.

224
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,485
-Am l late, Joe?
-Not yet.

225
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:30,643
Can't keep the gob-shites waiting.

226
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,012
Harry, l want something--

227
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:44,288
Hold on, hold on. Behind you.

228
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:48,005
Jesus wept.

229
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,132
Five minutes.

230
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,652
Sit down.

231
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,161
Have a drink.

232
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,252
What's this?

233
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:14,687
What's all this?

234
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:17,329
You've been on my heels for weeks.

235
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,051
Very eager for a G man.

236
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,051
l've something for you.

237
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:23,722
Don't!

238
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:25,889
Don't you ever calm down?

239
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:30,968
Names and addresses
of the whole cabinet.

240
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:32,930
They're to be lifted tonight.

241
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,084
lt's an illegal gathering...

242
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:39,846
...in open defiance
of His Majesty's government.

243
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:47,246
How'd you get this?

244
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:50,686
Like you said, l'm eager, for a G man.

245
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:54,250
Why should l trust you?

246
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:56,603
Logically, l suppose you shouldn't.

247
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:59,813
But l've been on your heels for weeks...

248
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,243
...making notes of your speeches.

249
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:06,212
Let's just say that you can be persuasive.

250
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,490
You work for the Castle.

251
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:12,802
l know.

252
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,371
What was it you said...

253
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:18,208
...'Our only weapon is our refusal.'

254
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:33,242
l am getting very tired of the spectacle...

255
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,689
...of an upstart dominating
these entire cabinet proceedings.

256
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,929
l've said it before and l'll say it again:

257
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,971
The minister is, as usual,
exceeding his brief.

258
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,606
And just what is my brief?

259
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:45,092
lntelligence.

260
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:46,288
Bullshit.

261
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:49,849
l'm minister for gunrunning,
daylight robbery and general mayhem.

262
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,606
Until we're armed,
nothing's going to happen.

263
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:55,964
But as minister of intelligence,
l'd like to inform you...

264
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,408
...that each of us is to be arrested...

265
00:18:58,573 --> 00:18:59,642
...tonight.

266
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,291
How does the minister know this?

267
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,762
Now, Cathal, don't exceed your brief.

268
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:11,246
Names, addresses, next of kin,
of the whole cabinet.

269
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,572
They know more about us
than our mothers do.

270
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:18,250
How do we know it's genuine?

271
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:21,242
We don't, chief. But it could well be.

272
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:23,643
So, nobody sleeps at home tonight.

273
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,250
l disagree.

274
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:34,645
Do sleep at home tonight.

275
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,129
lf Mr. Collins has been gulled,
we'll sleep soundly.

276
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:40,642
lf not, they will arrest the cabinet.

277
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:44,203
The public outcry will be deafening.
Maybe then the world will listen.

278
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:48,127
You can't be serious. We've been
rotting in English jails long enough!

279
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:50,131
l...am...

280
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:51,686
...serious, Michael.

281
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:57,572
Fuck them.

282
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:01,166
-Mind your tongue.
-l fucking will in future.

283
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:03,842
Mother of God.

284
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:05,406
Pull in.

285
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:11,524
Christ, the G man was right.

286
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:13,648
Come on.

287
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:35,721
This is an illegal arrest...

288
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:38,526
...by an illegal force of occupation!

289
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:43,407
Jesus Christ.

290
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:50,171
lt's the safest house in Dublin now.

291
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:52,005
May as well stay the night.

292
00:20:58,773 --> 00:21:00,923
What does the minister think?

293
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:02,852
Which minister?

294
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:05,771
We're the only two left.

295
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,364
l'm changing your brief.

296
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:11,970
l hereby appoint you
minister for general mayhem.

297
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,092
What's your brief?

298
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,208
The same.

299
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:18,205
Plus one other portfolio.

300
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:20,012
Jailbreaks.

301
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:44,326
How are youse?
Didn't l tell you he snores?

302
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:47,162
How are you?

303
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:49,244
Do you remember Kitty?

304
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,963
lndeed l do. Do you remember me?

305
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,486
Vaguely.

306
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:57,326
All right...

307
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,364
...l know when l'm not wanted.

308
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:01,408
See you.

309
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,403
-Good night.
-Good night, Mr. Boland.

310
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:36,685
l'll wrestle you for her.

311
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:39,565
Go away.

312
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:42,925
She's not interested in a bogman like you.

313
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:44,486
Want to bet?

314
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:46,291
Come here, Boland!

315
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:57,086
Leave me alone!

316
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:02,731
Give us a hand, will you?

317
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:04,292
Give me an ear!

318
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:09,925
Fuck off and leave me alone!

319
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,563
What's your game, Mr. Broy?

320
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:25,003
-Don't have a game.
-Why did you give me that list?

321
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:26,765
Why didn't you act on it?

322
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,882
The cabinet thinks it's useful in jail.

323
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:31,805
You obviously don't agree.

324
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:33,088
Look...

325
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:37,644
...Castle informers have run
us through like woodworm.

326
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:40,044
You could play the same game.

327
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:42,243
You're a queer bloody G man.

328
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:44,562
You don't believe me, do you?

329
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:45,802
l'm not sure.

330
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,651
What would convince you?

331
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:54,371
Show me the Castle files.

332
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:56,562
l'd never get them out.

333
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:57,722
No...

334
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:00,805
...but you could get me in.

335
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:04,645
Jesus, you're serious?

336
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,166
Think l'm joking?

337
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:08,244
Does anybody know what l look like?

338
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,322
Only me.

339
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:12,286
Pretend l'm an informer.
Let me in at midnight.

340
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:13,488
We'd never get away with it.

341
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:17,566
Everything's possible if you wish
hard enough. Who said that?

342
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:18,927
You did.

343
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,088
'Twas him.

344
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,402
Peter Pan.

345
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:50,521
How is it?

346
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:54,243
-Grand evening.
-Yeah, not bad.

347
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:55,647
ls Broy here?

348
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:57,326
-Who?
-Detective Ned Broy.

349
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,802
Told me to drop by if l had information.

350
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:01,728
How are you?

351
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:08,452
lnspector Broy?

352
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:10,527
Down there.

353
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:28,325
-Who is it?
-Grace, sir, John Grace.

354
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:33,450
Come in, Mr. Grace.

355
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:37,568
l've information relating to
the guttersnipe called Collins.

356
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:39,803
-You're not nervous?
-l'm shaking.

357
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:44,962
Don't.

358
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:46,688
Use this.

359
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:47,808
Sorry.

360
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:51,645
lndex to the files.

361
00:25:52,293 --> 00:25:55,524
Files on the lRB in England,
Scotland, America.

362
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:57,092
lrish Volunteers.

363
00:25:57,253 --> 00:25:59,164
Sinn Fein, more Sinn Fein.

364
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,686
More lRB.

365
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:04,804
l have to lock you in.
lf you hear anyone, be quiet.

366
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:07,804
lf caught, you're on your own.

367
00:26:07,893 --> 00:26:09,246
Don't l know it.

368
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,451
Jesus wept.

369
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:10,282
Christ, that's all we need.

370
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,969
Get up, you! Get up!

371
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,323
-Get up!
-He was celebrating, Tom!

372
00:27:15,973 --> 00:27:17,326
The birth of his child.

373
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:20,450
Was he, now?
And what was it, boy or girl?

374
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:21,489
Girl.

375
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:23,166
Have a drink.

376
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:25,571
All work and no play.

377
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,685
Are you finished in here?

378
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:05,291
lt's a drink, is it? Shame to waste it.

379
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:06,721
Take it.

380
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:20,451
Let's get you cleaned up
and take you home.

381
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:36,884
-Where's me breakfast?
-Time to go, Mick.

382
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:38,167
Wait a minute.

383
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:40,650
Mick, you're pushing it.

384
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:42,492
Can you get a typist?

385
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:43,528
Why?

386
00:28:43,693 --> 00:28:45,809
Copy every new file and send it to me.

387
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,123
l'll try. Now, you've got to leave.

388
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,682
You could squash us in a week, you know.

389
00:28:50,893 --> 00:28:52,849
Why do you think l came to you?

390
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:55,004
lf we don't get there first...

391
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,085
...things might get rough.

392
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:58,288
How rough?

393
00:28:58,373 --> 00:28:59,488
Very rough.

394
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:03,411
These files are no good without
the G men who compiled them.

395
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,642
That's rough.

396
00:29:05,573 --> 00:29:06,972
Can you handle it?

397
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:10,764
After tonight, l can handle anything.
Come on.

398
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:23,009
Where the hell have you been?

399
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:24,208
Working.

400
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,243
Where?

401
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:29,607
l want a file made on every member
of the British administration.

402
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:34,883
Look through whatever you can find:
'Who's Who', society columns.

403
00:29:36,613 --> 00:29:38,888
l want names, addresses, clubs...

404
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:41,891
...where they bank,
what they eat for breakfast.

405
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:45,247
Keep it up to date. Add to it weekly.

406
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:46,562
Tom...

407
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:50,609
...get me a list of our 12 best men.
Young, no families.

408
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:53,122
-What for?
-The 12 Apostles. Just do it!

409
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:55,524
Joe, take a letter.

410
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,251
Where have you been?

411
00:29:57,413 --> 00:29:59,483
'To Whom lt May Concern:

412
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:02,531
'This is to inform you
that any further collaboration...

413
00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:06,003
'...with the forces of occupation
will be punishable by death.

414
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,091
'You have been warned.

415
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:12,166
'Signed, the lrish Republican Army.'

416
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,646
Are you serious?

417
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:18,567
Afraid so.

418
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,251
Send one to every G man.

419
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,642
l saw their files. They know too much.

420
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:24,688
Look.

421
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:27,325
Look. That's us.

422
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:32,485
-Where'd you get these?
-Know how they thrive?

423
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:34,086
lnformers.

424
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,684
Without them,
the Brits would have no system.

425
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,650
Now, imagine the Castle...

426
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:43,964
...where anyone who collaborated
knew he'd be shot.

427
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,250
They wouldn't be able to move
outside those fucking walls.

428
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,971
That's how serious l am.

429
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:51,564
There's only one problem.

430
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:52,762
What?

431
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:55,406
We'd have to do it.

432
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:58,768
Yes.

433
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:04,768
So...

434
00:31:07,653 --> 00:31:09,166
...could you bear it?

435
00:31:23,053 --> 00:31:24,372
You got one too?

436
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:25,721
lt's a joke.

437
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:28,123
No Fenian guttersnipe threatens me.

438
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,727
Give us a name.

439
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:31,081
What for?

440
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:34,773
Someone to hang and fry like bacon!

441
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:44,441
Here's one.

442
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:47,042
Cullen.

443
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:24,851
Don't threaten us, you Fenian swine.

444
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:26,685
We threaten you!

445
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:28,526
What's this mean?

446
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:33,008
lt means you can get out now.

447
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:34,088
What?

448
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:35,965
Give up our jobs?

449
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:38,846
And miss out on all the fun?

450
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,644
Or face the music, Hoey.

451
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:44,533
You're the only one
who will make music here.

452
00:32:51,253 --> 00:32:53,005
God's curse on them!

453
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:57,972
Go on!

454
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,166
Who's John Grace?

455
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:08,449
Ned?

456
00:33:12,213 --> 00:33:13,532
They dumped him.

457
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:29,002
Tommy.

458
00:33:29,573 --> 00:33:30,528
Hoey.

459
00:33:30,693 --> 00:33:32,285
l know. Come on.

460
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:45,769
Any of ye who read lrish history
know movements like ours...

461
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:49,124
...are always destroyed
by paid spies and informers.

462
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:52,965
l want to set up an outfit
that'll rectify that.

463
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:57,883
Your job will be to wreck the system of
information the Castle uses against us.

464
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:00,772
To make it unhealthy for them to run it.

465
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:02,492
How unhealthy?

466
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,449
We've sent letters of warning...

467
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:07,371
...to every G man.

468
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:10,691
lf they're stupid enough
to stay in the Castle...

469
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,771
...then they'll be shot.

470
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:15,083
And you will have to do the shooting.

471
00:34:16,293 --> 00:34:18,523
Don't expect it to be pleasant.

472
00:34:19,413 --> 00:34:22,644
Any of ye with any qualms,
there's the door.

473
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:29,162
Would we have got past the door?

474
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:32,731
You would have, Vinny.

475
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,886
Seriously though,
l won't force this on any man.

476
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:09,243
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

477
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:44,687
l want to thank you.

478
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,605
For what, Father?

479
00:35:46,773 --> 00:35:48,206
For these mornings...

480
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:49,885
...praying together.

481
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:55,683
l can't pretend to understand your politics.

482
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:57,965
But l can appreciate...

483
00:35:58,133 --> 00:35:59,805
...your integrity.

484
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,404
And l yours, Father.

485
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:06,612
And if prayer...

486
00:36:06,853 --> 00:36:09,083
...can transcend these things...

487
00:36:09,973 --> 00:36:11,725
...there's hope, surely.

488
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:13,652
There must be.

489
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:21,689
Raid!

490
00:36:21,773 --> 00:36:23,525
Out! Everybody out!

491
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:25,451
Move! Get out!

492
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:07,561
Ma'am, how do l get out of here?

493
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:08,728
Grand.

494
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,811
Give me The Mail.

495
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:29,164
That's for the job on Friday.

496
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:35,527
Get them! Get those two men!

497
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:36,921
Stop them!

498
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:45,045
These are the best premises
you could get?

499
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:47,488
A temporary stopgap, l swear.

500
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:55,243
What'll be next, the knackers' yard?

501
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:57,966
Made the front page.

502
00:37:58,133 --> 00:37:59,452
What does it say?

503
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,967
'Dublin Detective Riddled With Bullets.'

504
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:04,204
'Riddled'? Riddled?

505
00:38:04,773 --> 00:38:06,525
Why are you riddling people?

506
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:08,251
Ten bullets, when the one would do?

507
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,812
To make sure he died.

508
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:12,965
Lads, try and remember
they don't grow on trees.

509
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:14,532
-What don't they grow on?
-Trees.

510
00:38:14,613 --> 00:38:15,728
Get out.

511
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,491
-From the chief.
-When?

512
00:38:19,653 --> 00:38:20,847
This morning.

513
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:24,286
Boys, you did well.
But go easy on the riddling.

514
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:25,968
Go on.

515
00:38:29,653 --> 00:38:31,086
Sure it's from Dev?

516
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,724
Christ, pure genius.

517
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:34,848
Look.

518
00:38:42,293 --> 00:38:46,571
Yeah, l want peace and quiet.
l want it so much l'd die for it.

519
00:38:48,213 --> 00:38:50,124
You mean you'd kill for it first.

520
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:52,124
No, not first. Last.

521
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:54,685
You know you are good at it.

522
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:55,808
At what?

523
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:57,167
Bloody mayhem.

524
00:38:57,413 --> 00:38:59,131
You're not so bad yourself.

525
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:02,007
But Mick, you're more than good.

526
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:05,412
You leave them sitting
in the halfpenny place.

527
00:39:06,453 --> 00:39:08,330
We haven't seen anything yet.

528
00:39:10,453 --> 00:39:12,762
Are you saying things will get worse?

529
00:39:14,213 --> 00:39:15,965
So we'll have to get worse?

530
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:16,849
Yep.

531
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:19,966
Know what?

532
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:21,568
l hate them.

533
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,293
Not for their race or their brutality.

534
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,968
l hate them for leaving us no way out.

535
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,293
l hate whoever put a gun in Vinny's hand.

536
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,013
l know it's me and l hate myself for it.

537
00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:35,528
l hate them for making hate necessary.

538
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:37,809
l'll do what l have to do to end it.

539
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:43,647
Fancy a good time?

540
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,405
Not tonight, girls.

541
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:48,931
Relax, you bastard.

542
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:14,533
Dev, two minutes to the next watch.

543
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:21,408
Fuck's sake.

544
00:40:21,493 --> 00:40:23,085
Mind your language.

545
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:25,005
The bleeding key broke.

546
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:27,885
I'll try mine.

547
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:32,693
You can't. The fucking keyhole's jammed.

548
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:35,492
That's no excuse for obscenities.

549
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:38,844
Maybe I can force it out.

550
00:40:42,293 --> 00:40:43,567
Come on, Mick.

551
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,092
Come on!

552
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:47,251
Come on, Dev. Push.

553
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:51,325
Got it! Got it!

554
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:56,172
Emergency supplies!

555
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,971
Man, you are blessed.

556
00:41:00,453 --> 00:41:01,806
What's this?

557
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,327
A fur coat. Pretend you're a whore.

558
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:14,412
Come on! Up ahead!

559
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:17,167
All l'm missing is the high heels.

560
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:23,051
Drive! Hop to!

561
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:24,971
Get out! Get out!

562
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:43,292
You look good in furs.

563
00:41:43,373 --> 00:41:47,491
There are certain things
one should not do for one's country.

564
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:50,008
Like what? Go on the game?

565
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:53,410
Some died for lreland,
but Dev whored for lreland.

566
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,329
l suppose it does set
a historical precedent.

567
00:41:57,493 --> 00:41:59,882
l'll take you home again, Kathleen.

568
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:02,851
l see you've had fun in my absence.

569
00:42:03,013 --> 00:42:05,971
Right. Fun and games all the way, chief.

570
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:07,168
l know.

571
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:09,724
l read the papers.

572
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,891
God, we're famous.

573
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:23,484
No, he is. Lay low for a week.
That nose of his is hard to hide.

574
00:42:23,613 --> 00:42:25,888
Then all of Dublin can throw a hooley.

575
00:42:26,573 --> 00:42:29,167
-Did Dev speak to you?
-About what?

576
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:31,204
He wants to go to America.

577
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:34,692
Aye. And he wants me to go with him.

578
00:42:38,293 --> 00:42:39,772
You can't do this to me!

579
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:42,287
l want American public support and...

580
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:45,172
...recognition from the U.S.
for an lrish Republic.

581
00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:48,928
l want international opinion brought
to bear on the British government.

582
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:51,243
There's only one force they
understand and you know it!

583
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,244
Our job is at home!

584
00:42:53,813 --> 00:42:56,452
Our job is where l say it is.

585
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:58,922
As president of the lrish Republic...

586
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:02,090
...l want recognition from the U.S.

587
00:43:02,373 --> 00:43:05,649
Go to America then, blast you!
But leave me Boland!

588
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:08,648
What's so special about Harry?

589
00:43:08,813 --> 00:43:10,929
-l can't do it without him.
-Do what?

590
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:13,447
l can't run a war without Harry Boland!

591
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:16,689
You could run it without me.

592
00:43:34,053 --> 00:43:36,772
Christ, all of Dublin must be out there,
Harry.

593
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:39,004
Look! Look at the face on Smith.

594
00:43:39,093 --> 00:43:41,084
So near, yet he can't touch him.

595
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:42,765
Don't worry. He'll try.

596
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:44,252
Not here, he won't.

597
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,484
No. But we can't let the
Long Fella hang around.

598
00:43:56,373 --> 00:43:57,965
Harry, come on! Move!

599
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,327
Dev!

600
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:00,448
Chief!

601
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:07,566
Good luck, mates.

602
00:44:14,093 --> 00:44:16,004
-Open up!
-Get out of my house!

603
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:19,248
Upstairs!

604
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,771
Remember one thing.
You're my chief, always!

605
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:52,048
Go on!

606
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:11,449
Move!

607
00:45:19,493 --> 00:45:23,122
Since you Dublin boyos
can't sort out this Collins...

608
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,085
...l suppose it's up to us.

609
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:28,966
Files on the lRB, England,
Scotland, America.

610
00:45:29,213 --> 00:45:30,885
The lrish Volunteers.

611
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:32,930
Sinn Fein, more Sinn Fein.

612
00:45:33,093 --> 00:45:34,287
Forget files!

613
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:38,811
l want anyone with a remote connection
to this geezer lifted! Tonight!

614
00:45:39,813 --> 00:45:41,485
lt's not that simple, sir.

615
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:44,133
But it is that simple, Mr. Broy.

616
00:45:44,693 --> 00:45:46,490
We'll make it that simple.

617
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:54,644
There's a new regime in here...

618
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:56,451
...and it's starting now!

619
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:58,971
Good day, Mr. Broy.

620
00:46:00,053 --> 00:46:02,487
Belfast efficiency's what they need.

621
00:46:13,893 --> 00:46:16,965
Passport.
You're Harry Clyne till you get there.

622
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:21,242
Here's a birth-cert for you,
some money and the like.

623
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:22,289
There.

624
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:23,448
Thanks, Mick.

625
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:27,287
Fuck and blast him!
l told him l can't do without you!

626
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:32,684
Why do you think he chose me?

627
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:36,843
He's scared to leave us together.

628
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:42,162
We might achieve the Republic
he's talking to the world about.

629
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:45,886
l don't know.

630
00:46:46,973 --> 00:46:50,682
They're filling up the Castle from Belfast.
Things'll get rough.

631
00:46:51,813 --> 00:46:53,644
Rougher than we can imagine.

632
00:46:53,973 --> 00:46:56,168
You don't let them near you, hear me?

633
00:46:57,053 --> 00:46:58,281
Don't let them near you.

634
00:46:58,373 --> 00:47:01,843
They can't imagine a gunman in
a pinstriped suit on a bicycle.

635
00:47:02,013 --> 00:47:04,732
Fuck it. lt's worked for us so far.

636
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:08,450
Let's hope my luck holds
and the wheels don't buckle.

637
00:47:09,613 --> 00:47:11,490
-Coming to the train?
-l will.

638
00:47:11,613 --> 00:47:13,729
There's someone to say hello to.

639
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:16,928
Yeah? l wonder who that is, now.

640
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,687
She needs looking after while l'm away.

641
00:47:25,253 --> 00:47:27,687
-He's leaving me, Mick.
-l thought he was leaving me.

642
00:47:27,773 --> 00:47:30,287
Shut up, you two. l'm leaving no one.

643
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:33,522
Do all the women in America
wear trousers?

644
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:36,411
Yes. Shameless hussies, the lot of them.

645
00:47:38,053 --> 00:47:39,372
Did you hear?

646
00:47:39,533 --> 00:47:42,172
A butterfly's been seen in West Clare.

647
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:45,131
lts wings are green, white and yellow.

648
00:47:45,893 --> 00:47:47,326
lt's a sign.

649
00:47:47,493 --> 00:47:48,767
My foot.

650
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:51,242
-l'm telling you.
-Know the problem of butterflies?

651
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,164
-What?
-They only last one day.

652
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:54,732
But what a day, Mick.

653
00:47:54,893 --> 00:47:57,043
-This one's empty.
-What a day.

654
00:47:57,773 --> 00:48:00,287
l leave you so. Here's your ticket.

655
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:05,964
lt'll be all right.

656
00:48:06,413 --> 00:48:07,562
l pray it will.

657
00:48:07,653 --> 00:48:08,847
See you, Mick.

658
00:48:19,973 --> 00:48:21,406
l don't want to go.

659
00:48:23,173 --> 00:48:24,686
-Will you write?
-l will.

660
00:48:24,773 --> 00:48:26,047
You promise?

661
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:27,282
See you.

662
00:48:38,853 --> 00:48:39,842
Papers, miss.

663
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:41,412
Lads, lads...

664
00:48:41,573 --> 00:48:44,212
...let a man say good-bye
to his wife in peace.

665
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:50,048
Sorry, Kitty.

666
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:51,964
We call it taking liberties.

667
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:54,283
l promised Harry l'd look after you.

668
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:55,402
Come on.

669
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:06,685
Take a section each.

670
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:10,688
The sooner we finish,
the sooner we go home.

671
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:12,764
Toothcomb, gentlemen.

672
00:50:13,653 --> 00:50:15,052
Toothcomb.

673
00:50:16,773 --> 00:50:19,003
Black and Tan scum!

674
00:50:21,613 --> 00:50:22,966
Fuck off!

675
00:50:23,533 --> 00:50:26,809
We put up with this bollox
every fucking day!

676
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,724
Stupid lrish cow!

677
00:50:53,573 --> 00:50:55,962
l love trains. Don't you, Ned?

678
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,330
What's so special about them?

679
00:50:59,053 --> 00:51:01,931
They make me think of places
l know l'll never see.

680
00:51:06,653 --> 00:51:10,009
They're the elite of the
British Secret Service.

681
00:51:10,973 --> 00:51:12,406
Churchill handpicked them.

682
00:51:12,493 --> 00:51:14,404
Give me everything you've got.

683
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:23,652
No addresses?

684
00:51:23,973 --> 00:51:25,565
They keep to themselves.

685
00:51:27,573 --> 00:51:29,768
They were sent here for one reason.

686
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:33,047
To eliminate you and your boys.

687
00:51:37,173 --> 00:51:39,289
l can't hold on much longer, Mick.

688
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:42,410
lt's pulling me to ribbons.

689
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,050
Neither can l, Ned.
But sure keep it a secret.

690
00:51:56,733 --> 00:51:59,452
Doesn't he have a face, this Collins?

691
00:52:00,653 --> 00:52:03,451
Doesn't he have corporeal form?

692
00:52:07,253 --> 00:52:08,686
This the best you've got?

693
00:52:08,773 --> 00:52:10,047
Afraid so, sir.

694
00:52:12,253 --> 00:52:13,732
That'll be all, boy.

695
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:16,085
Broy, sir.

696
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,162
Broy.

697
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:21,572
Yes. Broy.

698
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:51,890
Trouble you for a light, sir?

699
00:52:53,853 --> 00:52:54,729
Ta.

700
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:15,163
So that's Mr. Soames. How many to go?

701
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:16,488
Nineteen.

702
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:17,762
Tom, move.

703
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,563
l'll handle it, Liam. Tom.

704
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:31,246
How are you, Charlie?

705
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:33,052
This is Rosie.

706
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,851
How are you? Sit down.

707
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:37,930
Tell him about Mr. Soames.

708
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,129
Well, he tips me every day.

709
00:53:40,413 --> 00:53:41,892
Not like some.

710
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,611
What time does he get up?

711
00:53:43,693 --> 00:53:45,092
l come in at nine.

712
00:53:45,213 --> 00:53:48,250
He's washing behind the screen,
so l don't see him.

713
00:53:48,413 --> 00:53:50,927
l empty the basket and take the linen.

714
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:53,931
And then he reaches over the screen
with a half-crown.

715
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:55,366
You shouldn't take it.

716
00:53:55,453 --> 00:53:56,886
He's a gentleman.

717
00:53:57,053 --> 00:53:58,964
And you're a lady. Shut up, you.

718
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:00,645
Thank you, Mr. Collins.

719
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:03,008
Show him what you got from the basket.

720
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:07,968
Ta.

721
00:54:09,373 --> 00:54:10,328
Come on.

722
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:29,089
God bless you, Rosie.

723
00:54:34,253 --> 00:54:35,527
We've got them.

724
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:43,010
They have more experience.

725
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:46,842
You'll get only once chance.
lt's either them or us.

726
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:50,682
We hit them at daybreak.
lf you're not up to it, say so now.

727
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,007
l know what some of you
have been through.

728
00:54:54,173 --> 00:54:56,164
There's no shame in pulling out.

729
00:54:58,333 --> 00:54:59,368
Thank you.

730
00:54:59,453 --> 00:55:01,364
Don't stay in your usual places...

731
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:03,205
...Vaughan's, Cleary's Pub.

732
00:55:03,293 --> 00:55:05,443
lf any of us are lifted, we're dead!

733
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:06,762
Understood?

734
00:55:07,493 --> 00:55:08,926
Let's go.

735
00:55:24,093 --> 00:55:26,323
l got a message for you from Kitty.

736
00:55:27,173 --> 00:55:29,209
-Where is she?
-Vaughan's.

737
00:55:41,573 --> 00:55:43,211
Get your things, Kitty.

738
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,729
-Couldn't you say hello?
-Hello.

739
00:55:47,133 --> 00:55:49,886
-What are you doing?
-Harry told me to look out for you.

740
00:55:49,973 --> 00:55:51,372
You've heard of common courtesy?

741
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:52,283
No.

742
00:55:53,413 --> 00:55:54,482
Kitty, please. You can't stay here.

743
00:55:54,573 --> 00:55:56,291
-Why?
-Don't ask questions.

744
00:55:57,413 --> 00:55:58,368
Come on!

745
00:56:12,813 --> 00:56:15,373
lf any of our lads come in,
tell them to stay somewhere else.

746
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:17,728
-Where?
-Anywhere else! And look sharp!

747
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:31,928
Sufficient unto the day
the evil thereof, boy?

748
00:56:32,453 --> 00:56:33,681
Yes, sir.

749
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:35,771
Or is it Broy?

750
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,006
Broy, sir.

751
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,882
Good night.

752
00:56:49,693 --> 00:56:50,967
Stay on him.

753
00:56:55,173 --> 00:56:56,572
You're hurting me.

754
00:56:57,253 --> 00:56:59,528
l said, you're hurting me!

755
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:01,211
Kitty, please.

756
00:57:02,533 --> 00:57:03,648
Please.

757
00:57:42,853 --> 00:57:44,002
The Gresham.

758
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,482
Can't tell you...no, everything's fine.

759
00:57:46,693 --> 00:57:48,411
Call me if anything's up.

760
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,088
Come in!

761
00:58:15,813 --> 00:58:17,644
Where will you have it, Mr. Grace?

762
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:18,688
Here.

763
00:58:20,293 --> 00:58:21,851
-Ta.
-Thank you.

764
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:29,407
l'm going, Mick.

765
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:32,406
You can't!
Why do you think l brought you here?

766
00:58:32,573 --> 00:58:34,052
l don't know why!

767
00:58:36,893 --> 00:58:38,690
Vaughan's isn't safe.

768
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,561
Not tonight.

769
00:58:51,973 --> 00:58:53,691
Sweet mother of God!

770
00:59:01,453 --> 00:59:03,091
What was on the paper, Paddy?

771
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:04,003
Words.

772
00:59:04,093 --> 00:59:05,367
Just words.

773
00:59:09,853 --> 00:59:11,650
What's happening tonight?

774
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:13,571
You don't want to know.

775
00:59:14,373 --> 00:59:16,091
Am l allowed to guess?

776
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,492
Heard from Harry?

777
00:59:21,613 --> 00:59:22,568
Yes.

778
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:25,562
He wrote.

779
00:59:27,813 --> 00:59:29,405
He always writes.

780
00:59:31,453 --> 00:59:34,490
When you both came to Granard
the first time, you....

781
00:59:36,613 --> 00:59:38,524
But he was the one that wrote.

782
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:40,726
Why was that, Mick?

783
00:59:42,173 --> 00:59:44,403
He's the writing type, Harry.

784
00:59:54,053 --> 00:59:55,452
What type are you?

785
00:59:55,813 --> 00:59:57,371
Let me go!

786
00:59:57,533 --> 00:59:59,808
l know exactly where l'm going!

787
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,082
l can walk!

788
01:00:01,253 --> 01:00:02,811
l can walk!

789
01:00:11,973 --> 01:00:13,804
Promise me something, Kitty.

790
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:15,648
Anything.

791
01:00:16,093 --> 01:00:19,005
Promise me you'll never care about me.
Please.

792
01:00:20,933 --> 01:00:22,207
l promise.

793
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:34,731
That's the trouble with the lrish.
They sing at the drop of a hat.

794
01:00:34,813 --> 01:00:36,804
Ask them to talk and they won't.

795
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,171
Do what you have to do.

796
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:52,642
You've sent your boys out, haven't you?

797
01:00:55,253 --> 01:00:57,050
It's written on your face.

798
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:01,524
Every step they take.

799
01:01:04,253 --> 01:01:06,323
Like so many valentines.

800
01:01:06,973 --> 01:01:08,691
Delivering bouquets.

801
01:01:15,493 --> 01:01:17,484
Do you send a love note, Mick...

802
01:01:18,853 --> 01:01:20,286
...with the flowers?

803
01:01:30,693 --> 01:01:32,172
What does it say?

804
01:01:34,693 --> 01:01:36,445
Do it now!

805
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:37,568
Jesus!

806
01:01:39,653 --> 01:01:40,927
Come on!

807
01:01:41,093 --> 01:01:42,208
Go!

808
01:01:43,493 --> 01:01:45,404
lt says, 'Leave us be! '

809
01:01:47,093 --> 01:01:48,287
ls that all?

810
01:01:50,853 --> 01:01:52,605
Not very romantic.

811
01:01:53,813 --> 01:01:55,326
Move away from her.

812
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:07,487
You could at least
spare my wife this spectacle.

813
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:11,486
Take her outside.

814
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:22,088
l'm not his bloody wife!

815
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:34,202
Say your prayers.

816
01:02:37,723 --> 01:02:39,600
You know what it says, Kitty?

817
01:02:40,603 --> 01:02:44,118
lt says, 'Give us the future.
We've had enough of your past.'

818
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:45,956
The Lord is my shepherd....

819
01:02:46,043 --> 01:02:47,874
''Give us our country back...

820
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:49,956
''...to live in...

821
01:02:50,043 --> 01:02:51,396
''...to grow in...

822
01:02:52,283 --> 01:02:53,477
''...to love. ''

823
01:03:03,203 --> 01:03:05,512
So there is love there, Mick.

824
01:03:23,363 --> 01:03:24,842
Hang on, Rosie.

825
01:03:30,363 --> 01:03:32,513
Clean sheets, l think.

826
01:03:39,443 --> 01:03:40,717
Come on!

827
01:03:50,483 --> 01:03:51,802
So, Mick...

828
01:03:53,523 --> 01:03:55,115
...flowers delivered.

829
01:03:57,363 --> 01:03:59,115
Do you think they got the message?

830
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,682
Any casualties?

831
01:04:18,363 --> 01:04:19,921
Any casualties?

832
01:04:22,043 --> 01:04:23,317
Are you deaf?

833
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:24,552
Broy.

834
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:26,794
Ned - fucking - Broy!

835
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:30,836
What are you talking about?
Broy wasn't out.

836
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:32,994
They lifted him at Vaughan's.

837
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,522
What was he doing?

838
01:04:38,483 --> 01:04:40,394
Oh, sweet mother of Jesus.

839
01:07:26,523 --> 01:07:28,479
Can't risk it any longer, Mick.

840
01:07:29,563 --> 01:07:31,281
Who'll give in first, Joe?

841
01:07:31,443 --> 01:07:32,717
Us or them?

842
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:36,241
The body or the lash?

843
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:53,075
You look like a gangster!

844
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:55,514
You look like a ghost!

845
01:07:56,203 --> 01:07:57,682
Welcome back, Harry!

846
01:07:58,123 --> 01:07:59,442
How are you keeping?

847
01:07:59,523 --> 01:08:00,922
Grand.

848
01:08:03,363 --> 01:08:05,001
You're famous over there.

849
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:06,152
Where?

850
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:08,515
Over there, you thick.

851
01:08:09,123 --> 01:08:10,875
So, how was America?

852
01:08:12,283 --> 01:08:13,238
Great.

853
01:08:15,163 --> 01:08:17,393
Dev never got to meet the President.

854
01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:19,681
l didn't think he would.

855
01:08:26,123 --> 01:08:27,272
How are you?

856
01:08:28,163 --> 01:08:29,642
l'm grand.

857
01:08:36,763 --> 01:08:38,242
Welcome back, chief.

858
01:08:45,803 --> 01:08:48,033
The Big Fella sends his regards.

859
01:08:53,403 --> 01:08:55,633
We'll see who is the big fella.

860
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:00,996
Apologies, gentlemen.

861
01:09:24,283 --> 01:09:26,513
As you may know...

862
01:09:30,043 --> 01:09:34,400
...we have had some communication
from the British side.

863
01:09:35,883 --> 01:09:38,841
There is a slim possibility...

864
01:09:39,963 --> 01:09:42,158
...that they might want to talk.

865
01:09:45,123 --> 01:09:46,522
But our...

866
01:09:48,363 --> 01:09:49,637
...tactics...

867
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:55,396
...allowed the British press
to paint us as murderers.

868
01:09:57,883 --> 01:10:01,239
lf we are to negotiate
as a legitimate government...

869
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,638
...our armed forces must act...

870
01:10:03,803 --> 01:10:06,237
...like a legitimate army.

871
01:10:09,883 --> 01:10:12,522
What exactly do you mean, Dev?

872
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:16,441
l mean large-scale engagements.

873
01:10:18,443 --> 01:10:20,559
You mean, like in 1916?

874
01:10:22,203 --> 01:10:24,842
The great heroic ethic of failure...

875
01:10:25,563 --> 01:10:28,236
...marching to slaughter.

876
01:10:29,003 --> 01:10:31,563
Why don't we save them the bother
and blow our own brains out?

877
01:10:31,643 --> 01:10:32,758
How dare you!

878
01:10:32,843 --> 01:10:34,674
How did we get them to this point...

879
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,355
...to consider talking?

880
01:10:36,443 --> 01:10:39,401
We brought them to their knees
the only way we could!

881
01:10:39,483 --> 01:10:41,075
They call us...

882
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:42,517
...murderers.

883
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:44,838
War is murder! Sheer, bloody murder!

884
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,961
Had you been here the past year,
you'd know that!

885
01:10:55,323 --> 01:10:57,473
l propose an assault...

886
01:10:57,643 --> 01:11:01,841
...on the administrative center
of British rule in lreland:

887
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:09,074
The Customs House.

888
01:11:12,843 --> 01:11:15,641
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

889
01:11:18,603 --> 01:11:19,718
How many lost?

890
01:11:19,803 --> 01:11:23,159
6 dead, 70 taken! Bloody fiasco!

891
01:11:23,723 --> 01:11:25,236
Christ, not again!

892
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:42,678
The guns!

893
01:11:42,843 --> 01:11:44,356
We need the guns!

894
01:11:44,523 --> 01:11:45,797
Leave them!

895
01:12:24,283 --> 01:12:26,114
There's nothing we can do.

896
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:29,361
There's nothing we can do.

897
01:12:31,323 --> 01:12:33,712
How much longer can we hold out?

898
01:12:37,483 --> 01:12:39,838
Four weeks. But keep it a secret.

899
01:12:40,043 --> 01:12:41,556
As little as that?

900
01:12:41,683 --> 01:12:43,514
Unless we use bows and arrows.

901
01:12:43,603 --> 01:12:46,037
Don't be flippant, Michael.

902
01:12:48,603 --> 01:12:50,912
We nearly lost 80 men last week, Dev.

903
01:12:52,523 --> 01:12:54,002
You tell him, Harry.

904
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,642
He's right, chief.

905
01:13:05,603 --> 01:13:07,082
l lied.

906
01:13:07,963 --> 01:13:10,033
You lied? About what?

907
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:12,917
We can't hold out for another week.

908
01:13:15,283 --> 01:13:17,001
Christ! Do they know that?

909
01:13:17,123 --> 01:13:18,602
Nobody knows.

910
01:13:19,123 --> 01:13:20,954
Mick, Dev's negotiating.

911
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:23,318
Yes, so he doesn't know either.

912
01:13:23,643 --> 01:13:25,838
lt's very important he doesn't know.

913
01:13:26,123 --> 01:13:28,512
The world must believe we're invincible.

914
01:13:28,643 --> 01:13:30,361
Maybe then we can talk.

915
01:13:32,643 --> 01:13:34,474
Jesus Christ.

916
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:38,516
Kitty's down.

917
01:13:40,763 --> 01:13:42,162
So l heard.

918
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:47,636
ls she down to see you or me?

919
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:49,475
Maybe both of us.

920
01:13:51,003 --> 01:13:53,676
You take her down to Kingstown.
Get some sea air.

921
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,401
No, why don't you take her?

922
01:13:55,483 --> 01:13:57,235
No, you take her.

923
01:13:57,883 --> 01:13:59,874
-No, you take her.
-No, you do.

924
01:14:03,563 --> 01:14:06,760
A horse called 'lrish Republic'
ran at Donnybrook today.

925
01:14:07,003 --> 01:14:08,675
What were the odds?

926
01:14:08,843 --> 01:14:11,641
-50-to-1 .
-Jesus, some odds, what?

927
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:16,519
There's 100,000 Tommies here
and not 2,000 of us.

928
01:14:16,643 --> 01:14:19,396
l'd say 50-to-1 is optimistic.

929
01:14:19,683 --> 01:14:21,401
Optimistic or no...

930
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,592
...she won.

931
01:14:22,683 --> 01:14:24,116
No, you're joking?

932
01:14:24,923 --> 01:14:27,881
10 bob each way, that makes £25...

933
01:14:28,043 --> 01:14:30,352
...plus the place money, £7,10.

934
01:14:30,523 --> 01:14:31,797
So l won...

935
01:14:31,963 --> 01:14:34,523
...£33,10, thank you very much.

936
01:14:35,243 --> 01:14:37,757
Let the lrish Republic buy us dinner.

937
01:14:37,923 --> 01:14:40,278
l know just where to go.

938
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,592
Which one of you will ask me to dance?

939
01:14:58,763 --> 01:15:00,719
-Me, me, me, please!
-No, l will. l will.

940
01:15:00,803 --> 01:15:03,158
Heads, it's Harry. Tails, it's Mick.

941
01:15:05,883 --> 01:15:09,717
-Kitty, may l have the pleasure?
-The gangster wins again.

942
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,521
Watch his feet, Kitty.

943
01:15:11,643 --> 01:15:12,996
Shut up, you.

944
01:15:16,843 --> 01:15:19,038
l shouldn't have left, should l?

945
01:15:19,203 --> 01:15:20,352
Why not?

946
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,235
l was a length ahead.

947
01:15:23,403 --> 01:15:24,677
Now where am l?

948
01:15:25,163 --> 01:15:26,801
lt's not a race, Harry.

949
01:15:30,363 --> 01:15:32,638
Mind telling me what it is, then?

950
01:15:34,683 --> 01:15:36,116
You without him...

951
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,802
...him without you...

952
01:15:38,403 --> 01:15:39,961
...l can't imagine it.

953
01:15:40,923 --> 01:15:42,595
Three-legged race.

954
01:15:57,243 --> 01:15:59,234
Mick, where the hell have you been?

955
01:15:59,323 --> 01:16:02,759
For God's sake, give me one
free night to be a human being!

956
01:16:02,923 --> 01:16:04,914
We looked all over! Have you heard?

957
01:16:05,003 --> 01:16:06,356
No, l haven't heard!

958
01:16:06,443 --> 01:16:10,277
Would the bloody lrish Republic
leave me some time off?

959
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:11,717
lt's over!

960
01:16:12,603 --> 01:16:13,922
What's over?

961
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:15,272
lt's over.

962
01:16:15,563 --> 01:16:17,155
They called a truce.

963
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:22,671
lt's finished?

964
01:16:22,843 --> 01:16:24,754
-The whole damn thing.
-Yes.

965
01:16:25,803 --> 01:16:27,156
We've won?

966
01:16:27,283 --> 01:16:29,717
Lloyd George has thrown in the towel?

967
01:16:30,763 --> 01:16:34,199
We've brought the British Empire
to its knees?

968
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:35,478
Yes.

969
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:39,756
Why the fuck didn't you say so?

970
01:16:46,203 --> 01:16:48,114
What was that horse called?

971
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,473
We did it! We did it! lt's a truce!

972
01:17:14,123 --> 01:17:14,999
What?

973
01:17:16,843 --> 01:17:18,834
You must be joking?

974
01:17:20,523 --> 01:17:22,195
No. l won't do it.

975
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:25,401
l'm not a politician.
l'm not going to London.

976
01:17:25,643 --> 01:17:28,203
You're the strongest card we have.

977
01:17:29,403 --> 01:17:32,634
They call me an assassin and a murderer!

978
01:17:32,843 --> 01:17:35,073
Will Churchill even shake my hand?

979
01:17:35,243 --> 01:17:38,201
We've broached it and had no objections.

980
01:17:38,683 --> 01:17:40,036
You go, Dev.

981
01:17:40,163 --> 01:17:41,960
You're the statesman.

982
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:45,120
You know how far we can push them.
They know you.

983
01:17:45,323 --> 01:17:48,440
That's the point. They don't know you.

984
01:17:53,683 --> 01:17:56,117
Don't do this to me, Dev. Don't do it.

985
01:17:56,923 --> 01:18:00,199
l'm no good at talk.
l'm a yob from West Cork.

986
01:18:00,323 --> 01:18:01,438
Please!

987
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:04,760
You'll head our team, Michael...

988
01:18:05,883 --> 01:18:09,558
...to negotiate a treaty
for the first time in history...

989
01:18:09,723 --> 01:18:11,918
...between lreland and England.

990
01:18:14,043 --> 01:18:17,592
We need to keep
a final arbitrator in reserve.

991
01:18:17,763 --> 01:18:18,832
You.

992
01:18:19,523 --> 01:18:22,674
That will be the lrish people.

993
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:26,516
And me...

994
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:30,154
...as president of the lrish Republic.

995
01:18:31,563 --> 01:18:33,235
Why does he want me there?

996
01:18:33,323 --> 01:18:34,278
Why?

997
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:37,640
-You put the fear of God into them.
-Save me the bullshit.

998
01:18:37,763 --> 01:18:41,312
Mick, you are the strongest card we have.

999
01:18:42,203 --> 01:18:43,477
What's he up to?

1000
01:18:45,523 --> 01:18:47,559
-What are you talking about?
-l have one simple asset.

1001
01:18:47,643 --> 01:18:50,282
All these years,
no one knows what l look like.

1002
01:18:59,323 --> 01:19:01,314
Which one of you is Michael Collins?

1003
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,518
He is.

1004
01:19:03,403 --> 01:19:04,518
That's him.

1005
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,642
The small fella.

1006
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:26,195
'From your very own plenipotentiary,
to the provisions of the said document...

1007
01:19:26,363 --> 01:19:29,673
'...hereinafter to be referred to
as The Letter:

1008
01:19:30,563 --> 01:19:32,679
'They didn't defeat us by force of arms...

1009
01:19:32,763 --> 01:19:35,800
'...but now they'll try to
do it by force of verbiage.

1010
01:19:35,963 --> 01:19:39,114
'The English language wasn't
meant to be spoken like that.

1011
01:19:39,203 --> 01:19:42,513
'How did these people ever
get to run an empire?'

1012
01:19:49,403 --> 01:19:50,438
Don't.

1013
01:19:51,163 --> 01:19:52,278
Why not?

1014
01:19:53,683 --> 01:19:55,321
'Cause you'll get hurt.

1015
01:19:56,523 --> 01:19:57,956
How will l get hurt?

1016
01:20:04,123 --> 01:20:05,636
l'm in love with him.

1017
01:20:12,283 --> 01:20:13,557
l'm sorry.

1018
01:20:14,203 --> 01:20:15,761
l have to tell you.

1019
01:20:20,523 --> 01:20:21,956
Have you told him?

1020
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:26,038
No.

1021
01:20:28,843 --> 01:20:30,435
And maybe l never will.

1022
01:20:33,403 --> 01:20:35,997
l'm only telling you
because l can't hurt you.

1023
01:20:43,883 --> 01:20:45,157
Lucky Mick.

1024
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:10,999
I did my best, Kitty,
but it won't be good enough.

1025
01:21:13,563 --> 01:21:16,521
We'll have an Irish Free State,
instead of an Irish Republic.

1026
01:21:16,603 --> 01:21:18,514
We'll have our own government.

1027
01:21:18,843 --> 01:21:21,801
But we have to swear allegiance
to the English Crown.

1028
01:21:22,203 --> 01:21:24,194
The position of the
north will be reviewed...

1029
01:21:24,283 --> 01:21:27,320
...but now it remains part
of the British Empire.

1030
01:21:27,563 --> 01:21:29,872
This treaty isjust a steppingstone.

1031
01:21:30,043 --> 01:21:32,273
I hope the country sees it as such.

1032
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:35,272
How are you?

1033
01:21:38,843 --> 01:21:40,913
ls this true?

1034
01:21:45,003 --> 01:21:47,153
lt's the best anyone could have got.

1035
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:50,561
This gives up the north...

1036
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:52,721
...divides the country.

1037
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:56,678
You expect us to give an oath
of allegiance to the Crown?

1038
01:21:56,843 --> 01:21:59,403
They can't comprehend
giving us the Republic.

1039
01:21:59,563 --> 01:22:01,554
And that's why Dev sent me.

1040
01:22:02,683 --> 01:22:03,638
What?

1041
01:22:03,803 --> 01:22:05,873
He knew we'd get no Republic.

1042
01:22:06,043 --> 01:22:08,511
He wanted me to bring back the bad news.

1043
01:22:08,923 --> 01:22:13,474
We can use the lrish Free State
to achieve the Republic we want.

1044
01:22:13,643 --> 01:22:15,395
lt's either this or war.

1045
01:22:15,643 --> 01:22:18,111
l won't go to war over words.

1046
01:22:19,323 --> 01:22:21,962
What if it's war either way, Mick?

1047
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:27,476
You published the terms
without my agreement!

1048
01:22:28,603 --> 01:22:31,401
-They were the best we could get.
-ln your opinion!

1049
01:22:31,483 --> 01:22:35,237
You sent me there knowing
they were the best we'd get.

1050
01:22:35,723 --> 01:22:37,953
-ldle speculation.
-No, it's the truth.

1051
01:22:38,043 --> 01:22:40,113
Or else you'd have gone yourself.

1052
01:22:40,283 --> 01:22:42,035
We don't have the Republic...

1053
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:45,240
...but freedom to achieve it.
Peacefully.

1054
01:22:45,403 --> 01:22:47,553
Surely it's time for peace.

1055
01:22:48,923 --> 01:22:51,881
What would you know about peace?

1056
01:22:56,443 --> 01:22:59,913
You said we could negotiate
on behalf of our government...

1057
01:23:00,123 --> 01:23:02,921
...the D il and the lrish people.

1058
01:23:04,283 --> 01:23:06,353
lf they reject it, l'll reject it.

1059
01:23:06,643 --> 01:23:09,521
lf they stand by it, l'll stand by it.

1060
01:23:09,883 --> 01:23:11,953
l want to know you'll do the same.

1061
01:24:01,243 --> 01:24:03,074
Will you come in for a pint?

1062
01:24:25,003 --> 01:24:26,516
He's read the papers.

1063
01:24:42,643 --> 01:24:44,440
Say something, would you?

1064
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:51,002
l've known the two of you for four years.

1065
01:24:52,443 --> 01:24:56,197
You've slept together,
lived together, fought together.

1066
01:24:57,803 --> 01:24:59,475
But your war is over now.

1067
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:05,074
What if it's just the beginning?

1068
01:25:08,123 --> 01:25:09,078
Christ.

1069
01:25:09,243 --> 01:25:11,154
l'd be better off in Longford.

1070
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:48,517
We were elected by the people of lreland...

1071
01:25:48,603 --> 01:25:50,514
We were elected by the people.

1072
01:25:50,723 --> 01:25:55,080
Did they think we were liars when we
meant to uphold the lrish Republic?

1073
01:25:57,323 --> 01:26:00,713
The letters preceding the negotiations...

1074
01:26:00,923 --> 01:26:04,552
...not once demanded recognition
of the lrish Republic!

1075
01:26:05,003 --> 01:26:07,995
We knew it would have been refused!

1076
01:26:08,283 --> 01:26:10,319
So Mr. Collins is asking us...

1077
01:26:10,523 --> 01:26:13,754
...to accept an oath of allegiance
to a foreign king...

1078
01:26:14,123 --> 01:26:15,761
...and the partition...

1079
01:26:16,803 --> 01:26:19,920
...and the partition of the northern part
of the country!

1080
01:26:20,283 --> 01:26:23,719
Mr. Collins,
the man who won the recent war...

1081
01:26:25,643 --> 01:26:27,873
...has himself described the treaty...

1082
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:30,841
...as a steppingstone toward
the ultimate freedom!

1083
01:26:32,843 --> 01:26:37,553
Mr. Griffith has described Mr. Collins
as the man who won the war!

1084
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:43,794
Point of order, Mr. Chairman.

1085
01:26:43,923 --> 01:26:46,039
Are we discussing the treaty or myself?

1086
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:48,114
The minister does not like what l say!

1087
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,875
Anything about me, say it!

1088
01:26:49,963 --> 01:26:52,523
Mr. Collins, your position in the army...

1089
01:26:52,683 --> 01:26:55,402
...was as chief of one subsection.

1090
01:26:58,283 --> 01:27:00,672
Nobody sought notoriety except you!

1091
01:27:00,803 --> 01:27:02,521
Come on, Cathal!

1092
01:27:02,643 --> 01:27:05,999
One person was held up by the press...

1093
01:27:06,203 --> 01:27:08,842
...and put into a position he never held.

1094
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:12,041
He was made a romantic figure...

1095
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:15,994
...a mystical character...

1096
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:17,880
...which he certainly is not!

1097
01:27:17,963 --> 01:27:21,114
The person l refer to is Michael Collins!

1098
01:27:34,403 --> 01:27:36,314
l would plead...

1099
01:27:37,203 --> 01:27:38,921
...with every person here.

1100
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:43,797
Make me a scapegoat, if you will.
Call me a traitor, if you will.

1101
01:27:44,683 --> 01:27:47,402
But please, let's save the country.

1102
01:27:48,203 --> 01:27:51,115
The alternative to this treaty is a war...

1103
01:27:51,763 --> 01:27:55,153
...which nobody in this gathering
can even contemplate.

1104
01:27:56,123 --> 01:27:57,761
lf the price of freedom...

1105
01:27:57,843 --> 01:28:00,482
...the price of peace,
is blackening my name...

1106
01:28:01,283 --> 01:28:03,001
...l will gladly pay it.

1107
01:28:06,003 --> 01:28:07,038
Thank you.

1108
01:28:25,803 --> 01:28:28,158
The result, ladies and gentlemen...

1109
01:28:28,323 --> 01:28:30,439
...is 64 to 57.

1110
01:28:31,883 --> 01:28:33,794
A majority of seven...

1111
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:37,674
...in favor of the treaty.

1112
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:58,399
There is one thing l want to say.

1113
01:29:03,243 --> 01:29:04,801
l want it to go...

1114
01:29:05,883 --> 01:29:07,794
...to the country...

1115
01:29:08,483 --> 01:29:10,678
...and to the world.

1116
01:29:13,003 --> 01:29:14,595
And it is this:

1117
01:29:17,203 --> 01:29:20,878
The lrish people established the Republic.

1118
01:29:22,963 --> 01:29:24,521
lt can only...

1119
01:29:24,723 --> 01:29:27,237
...be disestablished...

1120
01:29:27,403 --> 01:29:29,519
...by the lrish people.

1121
01:29:36,843 --> 01:29:38,640
As a protest...

1122
01:29:39,203 --> 01:29:42,354
...against the ratification of this treaty...

1123
01:29:42,483 --> 01:29:44,838
...which can only subvert...

1124
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,521
...the Republic...

1125
01:29:49,763 --> 01:29:50,718
...l...

1126
01:29:50,883 --> 01:29:53,477
...and my deputies...

1127
01:29:53,603 --> 01:29:56,037
...are leaving this house.

1128
01:30:13,403 --> 01:30:14,597
Traitors!

1129
01:30:14,723 --> 01:30:16,202
Traitors, all!

1130
01:30:26,523 --> 01:30:27,876
Not you, Harry.

1131
01:30:41,323 --> 01:30:42,836
All right, you've won.

1132
01:30:46,203 --> 01:30:48,592
You always win, Mr. Collins.

1133
01:30:49,363 --> 01:30:50,921
Rarely, Miss Kiernan.

1134
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:52,516
Very rarely.

1135
01:30:54,083 --> 01:30:55,914
Jesus, l hate you.

1136
01:30:56,843 --> 01:30:58,879
Sure. Join the club.

1137
01:31:51,963 --> 01:31:54,193
You're seven minutes late, Mr. Collins.

1138
01:31:54,283 --> 01:31:56,399
You've kept us waiting 700 years.

1139
01:31:56,563 --> 01:31:58,554
You can have your seven minutes.

1140
01:31:58,923 --> 01:32:00,834
Let's get this over with.

1141
01:32:04,523 --> 01:32:06,912
Company, present arms!

1142
01:32:32,883 --> 01:32:35,636
So that's what caused all the bother?

1143
01:32:43,883 --> 01:32:44,998
Now what?

1144
01:32:46,483 --> 01:32:48,201
Do l get to wear that hat?

1145
01:32:54,363 --> 01:32:56,001
This treaty...

1146
01:32:56,403 --> 01:32:58,963
...bars the way to the Republic...

1147
01:33:00,523 --> 01:33:02,002
...with the blood...

1148
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:04,520
...of fellow lrishmen!

1149
01:33:12,603 --> 01:33:14,912
lf it is only with civil war...

1150
01:33:16,323 --> 01:33:18,917
...that we can get our independence...

1151
01:33:19,723 --> 01:33:21,634
...then so be it!

1152
01:33:39,883 --> 01:33:41,794
The Volunteers...

1153
01:33:42,443 --> 01:33:45,560
...will have to wade through lrish blood...

1154
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:52,281
...through the blood of some members
of this government...

1155
01:33:52,803 --> 01:33:55,237
...in order to get...

1156
01:33:55,603 --> 01:33:57,434
...lrish freedom!

1157
01:34:03,003 --> 01:34:05,198
After 700 years....

1158
01:34:05,403 --> 01:34:07,200
After 700 years....

1159
01:34:23,883 --> 01:34:25,157
Let him speak!

1160
01:34:25,283 --> 01:34:26,602
Kitty, don't!

1161
01:34:26,763 --> 01:34:28,037
Leave him be!

1162
01:34:29,803 --> 01:34:32,363
You put the heart across me, Kitty.

1163
01:34:32,523 --> 01:34:34,479
l like the sound of your voice.

1164
01:34:37,483 --> 01:34:39,360
They won't accept the treaty.

1165
01:34:39,563 --> 01:34:41,155
No matter how the vote goes.

1166
01:34:41,243 --> 01:34:43,154
You heard what de Valera said.

1167
01:34:45,803 --> 01:34:48,681
'And to wade through rivers of blood....'

1168
01:34:48,923 --> 01:34:51,118
And who's blood you think
he's talking about?

1169
01:34:51,203 --> 01:34:52,079
Yours.

1170
01:34:52,243 --> 01:34:53,642
Will you marry me?

1171
01:34:54,363 --> 01:34:55,318
Yeah.

1172
01:34:59,403 --> 01:35:00,438
You will?

1173
01:35:04,363 --> 01:35:05,876
lt's that simple?

1174
01:35:06,443 --> 01:35:07,398
Yeah.

1175
01:36:17,163 --> 01:36:19,233
Who gave you that, you little runt?

1176
01:36:21,243 --> 01:36:22,312
What's all this about?

1177
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:24,598
-We've taken over the Four Courts.
-You fucking fool!

1178
01:36:24,683 --> 01:36:25,559
Mind your language.

1179
01:36:25,643 --> 01:36:27,281
You'll start a civil war!

1180
01:36:27,363 --> 01:36:28,955
We'll defend the Republic.

1181
01:36:29,043 --> 01:36:30,601
These kids don't know guns!

1182
01:36:30,683 --> 01:36:33,243
-We know how to train them.
-The way l trained you?

1183
01:36:33,323 --> 01:36:35,678
-On whose orders?
-The Volunteer Executive.

1184
01:36:35,763 --> 01:36:37,196
Dev's part of it?

1185
01:36:37,403 --> 01:36:38,631
His half of it?

1186
01:36:39,683 --> 01:36:42,436
Go away home to your mothers,
all of you!

1187
01:36:47,003 --> 01:36:48,641
You know what this means?

1188
01:36:48,723 --> 01:36:50,554
The army's split down the middle.

1189
01:36:50,643 --> 01:36:52,679
-Who's in there?
-Mellowes, Lynch...

1190
01:36:52,763 --> 01:36:54,594
...Tom Barry, Oscar Traynor.

1191
01:37:06,643 --> 01:37:08,042
Keep it off.

1192
01:37:08,763 --> 01:37:09,718
Why?

1193
01:37:09,843 --> 01:37:12,232
There's a gunman outside by the railings.

1194
01:37:12,723 --> 01:37:14,600
Jesus' sake.

1195
01:37:15,603 --> 01:37:17,321
They won't shoot me, then.

1196
01:37:20,403 --> 01:37:22,439
Jesus, what are you doing to me?

1197
01:37:23,403 --> 01:37:25,314
They can shoot us, but they can't get us.

1198
01:37:25,403 --> 01:37:27,598
-What are you talking about?
-lt's not possible.

1199
01:37:27,683 --> 01:37:29,753
l'm going to live to see you old.

1200
01:37:30,443 --> 01:37:31,876
l am old.

1201
01:37:32,643 --> 01:37:34,679
Old enough to see your hair turn grey.

1202
01:37:34,763 --> 01:37:36,993
l come from a long line of baldies.

1203
01:37:37,203 --> 01:37:38,238
Bald, then.

1204
01:37:38,323 --> 01:37:39,836
l can live with that.

1205
01:37:42,763 --> 01:37:46,961
l will not fight against men l trained with,
l fought with!

1206
01:37:47,163 --> 01:37:51,475
The people have spoken
for the treaty you brought home!

1207
01:37:51,603 --> 01:37:55,073
They've occupied the Four Courts,
Limerick, Cork. lt's anarchy.

1208
01:37:55,243 --> 01:37:56,801
Better anarchy than civil war!

1209
01:37:56,883 --> 01:38:00,193
-Churchill offered artillery!
-He can do his own dirty work!

1210
01:38:00,603 --> 01:38:02,241
Maybe he will, Michael.

1211
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:04,037
Maybe he will.

1212
01:38:13,763 --> 01:38:14,639
Stop!

1213
01:38:14,803 --> 01:38:16,919
-lt's not safe--
-Do as you're told.

1214
01:38:29,883 --> 01:38:32,397
Harry, talk to me, will you?

1215
01:38:32,843 --> 01:38:34,196
l don't want any bullshit, Mick.

1216
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:35,557
Neither do l.

1217
01:38:38,163 --> 01:38:39,596
Come upstairs.

1218
01:38:51,363 --> 01:38:53,001
ls it true what l heard?

1219
01:38:54,443 --> 01:38:55,796
You're engaged?

1220
01:38:56,843 --> 01:38:58,879
Should l apologize for that, too?

1221
01:38:59,843 --> 01:39:01,162
No, no, no.

1222
01:39:01,563 --> 01:39:03,201
l'm happy for you both.

1223
01:39:03,323 --> 01:39:05,075
Me arse. You don't look it.

1224
01:39:05,163 --> 01:39:07,677
Maybe l don't, but l'm trying.

1225
01:39:08,483 --> 01:39:10,678
Do you understand? l'm trying.

1226
01:39:19,723 --> 01:39:21,634
l miss the way it used to be.

1227
01:39:23,163 --> 01:39:24,232
Me too.

1228
01:39:26,443 --> 01:39:28,638
l hear you're Dev's right-hand man.

1229
01:39:29,883 --> 01:39:32,397
Well, l suppose that's how it goes.

1230
01:39:33,963 --> 01:39:35,874
We were too dangerous together.

1231
01:39:39,603 --> 01:39:41,480
Know the funny thing, Harry?

1232
01:39:44,363 --> 01:39:46,797
For the first time in my life, l'm scared.

1233
01:39:50,363 --> 01:39:52,194
The Big Fella, scared?

1234
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:57,594
l hate to say it, Mick,
but you've a right to be.

1235
01:39:58,763 --> 01:40:00,401
You don't understand me.

1236
01:40:02,043 --> 01:40:04,557
You told me once
l was good at bloody mayhem.

1237
01:40:04,843 --> 01:40:05,798
Right.

1238
01:40:05,963 --> 01:40:07,635
l left the Brits in the halfpenny place.

1239
01:40:07,723 --> 01:40:10,362
That's what l'm scared of,
because once l start...

1240
01:40:10,443 --> 01:40:11,717
...there'll be no stopping me.

1241
01:40:14,803 --> 01:40:17,601
Don't let it start, then.

1242
01:40:18,003 --> 01:40:19,436
Tear up that treaty.

1243
01:40:23,523 --> 01:40:25,434
lt's the only thing we've got.

1244
01:40:27,203 --> 01:40:29,034
So, then it starts.

1245
01:40:29,203 --> 01:40:30,158
What?

1246
01:40:31,443 --> 01:40:32,956
We fight.

1247
01:40:34,603 --> 01:40:36,355
They fight. We don't.

1248
01:40:36,523 --> 01:40:39,162
You've said what you had to say
and you can go now.

1249
01:40:39,243 --> 01:40:41,757
Listen,
you don't know what you're saying!

1250
01:40:41,963 --> 01:40:44,352
l have nothing more to say to you!

1251
01:40:46,943 --> 01:40:48,740
-Do it!
-Put the gun down!

1252
01:40:48,943 --> 01:40:51,093
Save us all a lot of bother. Do it!

1253
01:40:51,383 --> 01:40:52,816
Put the gun down.

1254
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:58,580
Do you not hear me!
l said put the gun down!

1255
01:41:01,663 --> 01:41:02,652
Get out!

1256
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:25,622
-Do it!
-Fire!

1257
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:53,226
How would you like a new boss, Joe?

1258
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:22,789
Check the other side.

1259
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:31,184
What happened?

1260
01:43:39,230 --> 01:43:42,745
They shot their way to the Catacombs.
He thinks Harry was with them.

1261
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:44,980
-Let's go.
-Mick, it's not safe!

1262
01:43:45,150 --> 01:43:46,788
We'll never get through!

1263
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:15,865
Stop!

1264
01:44:16,030 --> 01:44:17,099
Stop!

1265
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:45,309
Come on! Come on!

1266
01:45:56,470 --> 01:45:58,938
Calm down! lt's the Big Fella!

1267
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:10,784
What happened?

1268
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:14,264
Who closed your eyes?

1269
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:17,501
He tried to run across the river, sir.
l plugged him.

1270
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:19,865
l didn't ask you. l asked him.

1271
01:46:20,230 --> 01:46:21,504
You asked who?

1272
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:23,547
l fucking asked him!

1273
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:26,383
-But he's dead, sir.
-And you killed him, you little git!

1274
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:28,904
You plugged him,
you Free State gob-shite!

1275
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:31,228
-You were meant to protect him!
-He was one of them, sir!

1276
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:33,346
No, sonny! You don't understand.

1277
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:36,148
He was one of us.

1278
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:38,739
Go on!

1279
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:40,787
Back to your posts.

1280
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:52,228
The papers said his last words were:

1281
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:55,820
'Have they got Mick Collins yet?'

1282
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,427
You know it's not true, Mick.

1283
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:03,710
l don't know anything, anymore.

1284
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:12,787
Tell Dev Mick wants to talk.
Nothing more, nothing less.

1285
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:14,309
Not in Dublin.

1286
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:15,698
Where, then?

1287
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:17,024
West Cork...

1288
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:19,343
...there might be a chance.

1289
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:21,500
He'd never get out of there alive.

1290
01:47:21,670 --> 01:47:23,023
Doesn't he come from there?

1291
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:24,828
That's bandit country.

1292
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:27,140
They're bandits he trained, aren't they?

1293
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:29,664
Maybe.
But Mick doesn't know the new boys.

1294
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:32,699
He'll have to get to know them now.

1295
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:36,459
Gentlemen.

1296
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:00,539
What time is it?

1297
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:02,905
Seven. Have you been here all night?

1298
01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:04,219
Any news?

1299
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:07,507
They say if you went to Cork
there might be a possibility.

1300
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:08,706
Fuck!

1301
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:11,184
What do you think?

1302
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:15,104
We've cleared them out
except for West Cork.

1303
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:19,144
They wouldn't kill me in my own county.

1304
01:48:21,670 --> 01:48:23,786
How would you like a new boss, Joe?

1305
01:48:25,190 --> 01:48:27,101
Still, be nice to go home.

1306
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:31,979
-You'd be crazy to go.
-So, l'm crazy.

1307
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:33,981
Get the convoy together.

1308
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:35,219
Go on.

1309
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:45,027
-What?
-Here. For the cough.

1310
01:48:45,670 --> 01:48:47,388
Here. New handkerchief.

1311
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:51,824
Go on! You're like an old clucking hen,
fussing all the time!

1312
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:08,463
Sweet suffering Jesus!

1313
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:10,700
lf you're going down, l'm going too.

1314
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:29,742
That's where it all started, Joe.

1315
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:31,786
Fenian stories by the fireside.

1316
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:33,144
That's your home?

1317
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:35,061
Was, till the Tans burned it.

1318
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:42,308
What are you doing here, Mick?

1319
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:44,062
Haven't l a civil war to run?

1320
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:45,788
Come on! lt's my round.

1321
01:49:57,990 --> 01:50:00,788
Come to flog us that bloody treaty,

1322
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:03,301
l'm flogging fuck-all.
l've come to buy.

1323
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:05,221
Drinks for the county on me.

1324
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:09,022
Come on, four pints.

1325
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:36,424
ls it him?

1326
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:39,264
Looks like it.

1327
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:42,461
Looks like he wants to meet.

1328
01:50:50,150 --> 01:50:51,822
Can l trust him?

1329
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:54,859
Can you trust anyone these days, chief?

1330
01:51:17,190 --> 01:51:19,750
'Oh, well do l remember...

1331
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:21,583
'...the year of '48

1332
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:24,423
'When l rose with comrades

1333
01:51:27,710 --> 01:51:30,224
'l was hunted through the hills by slaves

1334
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:33,029
'Who served a foreign queen

1335
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:34,779
''And that's

1336
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:37,065
''Another reason why

1337
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:39,818
''I left old Skibereen''

1338
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:50,989
Say it to me, kid.

1339
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:52,423
Put it away, Joe.

1340
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:54,303
Who the fuck are you?

1341
01:51:57,230 --> 01:51:58,948
Who the fuck am l?

1342
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:03,903
l'm the fucker that asked to meet Dev.

1343
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:05,469
And who's Dev?

1344
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:06,949
And who are you?

1345
01:52:09,150 --> 01:52:11,903
lf l did know this Dev,
what would you say to him?

1346
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:18,379
Tell him...

1347
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:20,700
...Harry Boland's death was enough.

1348
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:25,825
Tell him Mick Collins wants to stop
this bloody mayhem.

1349
01:52:28,230 --> 01:52:31,108
Tell him l'm sorry
l didn't bring back the Republic.

1350
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:32,988
But nobody could have!

1351
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:41,819
He was my chief, always.

1352
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:45,189
l'd have followed him to hell
if he'd asked me.

1353
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:49,469
And maybe l did.

1354
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:58,902
But it's not worth fighting for anymore.

1355
01:53:00,990 --> 01:53:03,265
We've got to build with what we have!

1356
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:05,823
You tell him that.

1357
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:10,508
Where can he find you?

1358
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:11,745
Here.

1359
01:53:29,950 --> 01:53:31,588
So, l take it you heard?

1360
01:53:33,990 --> 01:53:35,708
Jesus, Mick.

1361
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:40,901
God forgive us, Harry.

1362
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:43,108
Have you got any reply?

1363
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:52,022
He's come all this way.

1364
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:55,146
Be rude not to give him an answer.

1365
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:21,140
Well?

1366
01:54:21,630 --> 01:54:23,621
He says he'll meet you tomorrow.

1367
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:25,548
What's wrong with now?

1368
01:54:26,230 --> 01:54:27,788
His nerves are at him.

1369
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:32,301
Beal Na Blath. A farmhouse
to the left on the Bandon side.

1370
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:34,664
Around 12:00.

1371
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:38,662
Hey kid...what's your name?

1372
01:54:43,230 --> 01:54:44,458
Little snot.

1373
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:23,943
Beal Na Blath?

1374
01:56:07,030 --> 01:56:09,021
Should l ask them all to the wedding?

1375
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:10,589
Do you think that'd fix it?

1376
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:12,581
Be a big bloody wedding, Mick.

1377
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:17,101
We'll invite the whole country.
Marital diplomacy.

1378
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:21,788
Dev as best man. Lloyd George,
Winston Churchill as bridesmaids.

1379
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:46,659
What's up?

1380
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:48,578
We're stopped?

1381
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:51,619
Roadblock.

1382
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:54,099
Move it!

1383
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:56,347
Get those carts off the road!

1384
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:03,505
How long?

1385
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:04,739
Two minutes.

1386
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:09,664
Jeez, they're trying to fucking kill me.

1387
01:57:09,790 --> 01:57:10,825
Get down!

1388
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:27,227
Give it to me! Get off!

1389
01:58:00,710 --> 01:58:02,189
No! Jeez, Mick!

1390
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:08,509
Talk to me!

1391
01:58:10,390 --> 01:58:11,789
Don't go!

1392
01:58:11,950 --> 01:58:13,508
Don't go, Mick!

1393
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:19,863
Jesus, don't go on us, Mick! Please!

1394
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:38,544
Miss Kiernan?

1395
01:58:48,990 --> 01:58:50,423
l'm sorry.

1396
01:58:52,670 --> 01:58:54,262
l just heard.

1397
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:56,865
l'm sorry.

1398
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:12,507
That's why he died, Kitty.

1399
01:59:12,990 --> 01:59:15,743
He knew the risk
he was taking to go there.

1400
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:18,666
But he thought it worth taking.

1401
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:22,103
He took them for us.

1402
01:59:22,190 --> 01:59:25,341
For every gob-shite in this country,
no matter what side.

1403
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:30,385
lf he saw you now,
know what he'd say?

1404
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:37,541
'Get off the parliamentary side
of your arse and get some color.'

1405
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:41,180
He would have said it better, Joe.

1406
01:59:43,190 --> 01:59:45,499
'No regrets, Kit.'
That's what he'd say.

1407
02:02:37,510 --> 02:02:39,501
