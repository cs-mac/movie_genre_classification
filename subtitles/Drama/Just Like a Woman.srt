00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:05,337
(silence)

3
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,047
â™ª

4
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,345
(Woman)
Give them some time.

5
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,453
You cannot rush things.

6
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,355
Your time is not God's time.

7
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:35,094
The Lord works in very
mysterious ways.

8
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,429
You can get up now.

9
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,032
I've left some
herbs now this evening.

10
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,468
Yes.
You are to boil
those herbs.

11
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,002
Yes.
She has to drink it

12
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,872
right before she goes to be
with her husband, okay?

13
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:50,342
This is
very important... okay?

14
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,182
$150, God willing, you'll
be a grandmother soon, Nishalla.

15
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:08,427
â™ª

16
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,630
(man)
Oh, no.

17
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,705
(man)
Oh, it's just kids.

18
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,374
Let's get inside.

19
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,985
Hey...

20
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,053
(woman shouting)

21
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,390
Okay, okay,
it's clean.

22
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,631
Hey.
Morning.

23
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,075
If that was my
mother-in-law...

24
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,877
Do it for me.

25
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:39,418
(music playing)

26
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,990
Stop it.

27
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,397
(woman)
$6.00

28
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,271
Bye.
Bye.

29
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,706
Bye!
(woman)
Bye.

30
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,881
(music playing)

31
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,683
(phone ringing)

32
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,588
Hello?

33
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,658
Just a second please.

34
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,525
Frank?

35
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,793
(Frank)
What can
I do for you?

36
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:22,928
Line two.

37
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,229
What line?

38
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,565
Two.
Okay, I got it.

39
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,572
(jingling)

40
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,376
(phone ringing)

41
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,745
Hello?

42
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:44,316
(man)
And up, around and chest two,
three and four.

43
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:48,687
And hips two, three
and four around and...

44
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,155
and four.

45
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,958
And hips two, three
and four, good.

46
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,727
And one and four.

47
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,562
Now hips, one...

48
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,499
four, shimmy and one.

49
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,167
four shimmy again.

50
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,038
One, four, shimmy, good.

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,441
One and four, now one.

52
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,177
All right, not bad
you guys, not bad.

53
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,746
What do you
think I'm gonna say?

54
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,415
What do you think
I'm gonna say?

55
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,950
Brains-- what am
I gonna say about brains.

56
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,452
Stop using them.

57
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:24,089
Dance with your body,
with your soul, okay?

58
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,793
Efficiency has no place in dance
especially belly dance, okay.

59
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,762
Enjoy yourselves,
enjoy your hips.

60
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,398
I need much more hips
out of all of you, okay?

61
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,766
All right, just work
on it for a second.

62
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,302
I just need to talk to Marilyn
for a second, if you don't mind.

63
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,537
Sure.

64
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,240
Did you talk to
Harvey yet?

65
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,309
No.
Why?

66
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,546
Look, you're the only one I have
here that has any chance

67
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:50,082
of getting in that
dance company in Santa Fe.

68
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,084
Now I told
them about you.

69
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,885
Are you gonna audition?

70
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:58,023
Look, I can't talk to
Harvey-- you know, he...

71
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,125
Why not, he's not
doing anything right now.

72
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,693
Well, exactly.

73
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,028
I know what
he'll say.

74
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,098
I just wanna spare myself
the disappointment of not...

75
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,968
and you need this
for yourself, all right?

76
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,571
Promise me you'll
talk to him?
Yes.

77
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,538
Okay.
Okay.

78
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,006
You might just get this.

79
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,545
(TV chatter)

80
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,353
Baby, don't eat that,
your cholesterol.

81
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,088
Well, shame on me.

82
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,056
Maybe if you
were here sooner

83
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,824
I wouldn't have to have
chips for dinner.

84
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,027
Well, it's Tuesday,
I have my class.

85
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,362
Right.

86
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,730
Belly dancing.

87
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,299
How could I forget?

88
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,201
What's that
supposed to mean?

89
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,936
Nothing, hey...

90
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,271
I think it's great
that you believe

91
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,507
you can still be
a dancer at your age.

92
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,709
I wish I had that positive
attitude.

93
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,714
So did you
find anything?

94
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,721
Why would you even
ask me that?

95
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,724
Because I have
a right to know.

96
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,293
You think I'm
not trying?

97
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,763
You think I'm purposefully
not trying to find a job?

98
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,499
You think...
I like this?

99
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,567
Sitting at home watching...

100
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,272
shit TV
and getting fat?

101
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,840
Harvey, I'm sorry.

102
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:41,193
Hey, sweet bird.

103
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,327
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,563
I'm an asshole,
okay?

105
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,797
I'm sorry-- I'm sorry
to make you think

106
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,434
that I thought
you weren't trying.

107
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:53,305
You wanna start over...
Hmm?

108
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,574
How was your day?

109
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:56,641
It was okay.

110
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,243
How was your class?

111
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,178
Class was great.

112
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,213
Actually, I wanna--

113
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,714
Did you get
paid today?

114
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:03,915
Why did--
I'm gonna--

115
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,117
I'm gonna need
a little cash.

116
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,252
What for?

117
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:11,223
I'm just gonna go out and
blow off some steam.

118
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,225
Well, baby,
I just got home.

119
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,126
Come on.

120
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,828
I wanna make
appearances.

121
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,029
What if something
opens up.

122
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,932
I want people
to know I'm alive.

123
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,935
So this is like
a job search?
Yeah.

124
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,238
You know, this is how
people make connections.

125
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:33,245
Where are you gonna make these
connections, Harvey, some bar?

126
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:38,083
Where's your purse?

127
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:42,854
Where's your goddamn purse,
Marilyn?

128
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,823
Where it always is.

129
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,509
Don't wait up.

130
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,177
(door closing)

131
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,879
Never do.

132
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,661
When we're lying in bed

133
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:27,065
what do you think about?

134
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,668
Nothing.

135
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,070
You're lying.

136
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,407
I'm not.

137
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,442
Don't you think...

138
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,777
what am I doing
with her?

139
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,079
She cannot even
give me a child?

140
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,448
No.

141
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,552
I never think
that way.

142
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,221
We could adopt.

143
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,090
(chuckles)

144
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:56,027
Leila is going to
be very happy.

145
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,329
(scoffing)

146
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,066
You want to know
what I'm thinking

147
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,201
when we lie in bed
together?

148
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:13,144
I wish my mother
would disappear.

149
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,947
You mean die?

150
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,616
That's horrible, Mourad.

151
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,451
I know.

152
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,252
She's your mother.

153
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,725
I'm the one that
should disappear.

154
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:37,235
â™ª

155
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,146
(Marilyn)
Hi, Frank.
Good morning.

156
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,496
(scoffing)

157
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:09,200
(phone ringing)

158
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,669
Ron?

159
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,704
Ron.

160
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,573
Who put my stuff in
the trash bag?

161
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,176
It's not funny.

162
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,278
I did it,
I packed your stuff.

163
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,346
Why?

164
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,015
Well, because business
isn't good.

165
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,751
It's the recession.

166
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,220
And you don't give
me any notice?

167
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,022
What-- I don't
get an explanation?

168
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,893
You're firing me as if I was
some fuckin' loser?

169
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,562
This is your
chance to--

170
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,663
a chance to move on.

171
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:39,798
Do something
different.

172
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,633
You are really sweet.

173
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,702
I think you're
really talented.
Don't.

174
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,379
Just pay me what
you owe me.

175
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,950
Well, I'll-- I can write
you a recommendation letter.

176
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,819
And say that I'm good at
answering the phone

177
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,255
and stacking boxes?

178
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,423
Do you think
you're good people?

179
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,458
Is this how you behave?

180
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,462
who's been in
the company for seven years?

181
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:14,265
Aside from everything else,
this is fucking illegal.

182
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,335
Well, then you
can take me to court.

183
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,270
(phone ringing)

184
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:28,780
â™ª

185
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,919
Harvey, call me.

186
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:13,391
(music playing)

187
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,202
Marilyn?

188
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,207
Everything is
all right?

189
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,342
I got fired.

190
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,344
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,847
You'll find
something else.

192
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,516
With a 20%
unemployment rate?

193
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,956
Know her?

194
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,392
She's Samia Gamal.

195
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:53,331
She was the best dancer
in Egypt.

196
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,902
They didn't even
give me a reason.

197
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,171
Do you have a bag?
Sure.

198
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,546
How much?

199
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,415
Take it.

200
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,857
(distant horns honking)

201
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,101

â™ª

203
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,463
Peter?

204
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,771
(Peter)
What's going on?
(sniffling)

205
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,773
Honey, talk to me.

206
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,676
Well, I got fired...
first.

207
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,245
Sorry.

208
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,613
Do you need a place
to stay?

209
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,214
Is there
something I can do?

210
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:53,551
No, Harvey's-- Harvey's
cheating on me.

211
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,586
Oh, that shit.

212
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:59,090
I just saw him, Peter,
with another woman in our bed.

213
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,492
I'm so sorry.
I feel so sick...

214
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,362
No, it's not
your fault.
...and stupid.

215
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,798
Is there anything
I can do?

216
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,333
I think I'm gonna go.

217
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:11,636
I think I'm gonna
go to Santa Fe.

218
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,404
Can you sign me up?

219
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,206
Yes.

220
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,075
I don't know
how I'm gonna--

221
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,810
I haven't got any
money or...

222
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:19,844
Don't worry
about that.

223
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,380
dancing in bars and
restaurants along the way.

224
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,881
Peter, I can't dance
in a restaurant.

225
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:24,916
Yes, you can.

226
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,284
I did it
for years.

227
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,386
Besides, it'll give you a chance
to work in front of an audience.

228
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,389
That's what you
need anyway.

229
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,158
Look, I know of a really good
place along the way to Santa Fe.

230
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,794
It's a, uh-- they're
friends of mine.

231
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:41,065
and then I'll text you
with their information, okay?

232
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,600
It's gonna be
all right.

233
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,168
I promise.

234
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,937
(laughing)
What?

235
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,372
You look ridiculous.

236
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,806
I know I
look ridiculous.

237
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,209
Well, I was doing
a facial.

238
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,477
You shouldn't bother
people when they're doing fac--

239
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,645
don't smoke, it's bad
for you.

240
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,073
Oh, uh, the green one.

241
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,514
Yes, yes.

242
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,852
I'm calling my parents.

243
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,493
I'm calling
my parents.

244
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,729
Right now.
Mona, Mona, what's
going on here?

245
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,065
Ma, please, enough.

246
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,433

Nowadays,
things are different.

250
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,581
You don't need to
have children.

251
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,785
Mona!

252

What?
Call 911.

Ma, Ma!

272

Is she dead?

273
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:06,764
Call an ambulance,

Ma!

Hello?

00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:41,852
Mona?

337
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,854
Will you
come with me?

338
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,994
Okay.

339
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,236
Hey, I need to dial this
Moroccan restaurant

340
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,504
in Belleville.

341
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,005
Will you
dial it for me?

342
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,374
It's under Tarek.

343
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,609
What's that...

344
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,345
Tarek?
T-a-r-e-k, Tarek.

345
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,523
Here, it's ringing.

346
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,061
Yes, can I
speak to Tarek?

347
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:28,132
Tarek, this is Marilyn,
I'm a friend of Peter.

348
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:33,804
Yeah, he told me you're looking
for a dancer for tonight?

349
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:36,874
You need two?

350
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:40,878
Yeah, there's
two of us.

351
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,816
Dinner and a room plus
a hundred each-- great.

352
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,152
All right, we'll
be there.

353
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,153
Thank you.

354
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,223
Can you
find Belleville?

355
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,558
Sure.

356
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,795
It's somewhere
out there.

357
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,429
Will you
do it with me?

358
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,867
Marilyn...

359
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:06,236
I don't dance
in restaurants.

360
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,138
You think I do?

361
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,109
First time for
everything, right?

362
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:16,146
I get it, but... I need
the money.

363
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,349
I'm guessing
you do too.

364
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,951
Think about it-- you'd be
doing me a favor.

365
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:25,689
This fucking car
is a gas guzzler.

366
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,624
Think about it?

367
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,092
Sure.

368
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,897
Did you find
Belleville?

369
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,075
(dishes clanking)

370
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,191
(man)
Okay, listen.

371
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,259
You dance
with the customer.

372
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,661
You have good time
in the club of mine.

373
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,930
Okay-- Come on, come on.

374
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:16,573
(applause)

375
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,513
(man shouting)

376
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:27,885
(music begins)

377
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:47,170
(clapping in unison)

378
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,244
(whistling)

379
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:25,402
$120 in tips
plus $100 each?

380
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,771
To think I spent seven years
doing a fucked up job

381
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:30,407
when I could've
been dancing every night?

382
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,441
(knocking)

383
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,378
Hey.
Hey.

384
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,280
You guys did
fantastic job.

385
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:41,218
But there's one thing that
my customer doesn't like

386
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,522
blonde woman to dance,
so black wig-- cool?

387
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,556
Dye it black?

388
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,691
Sure.

389
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,826
Okay.

390
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,695
What's up?

391
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,497
Here's a hundred
for you.

392
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:59,069
Go have some drink and leave me
with your friend here.

393
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:03,840
She's not interested.

394
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,877
How about you?

395
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,078
Listen to me, Mister.

396
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,047
We had a deal,
we kept our end of it.

397
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,549
Leave us alone or I'm
calling the cops.

398
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,818
What the fuck you
think you're talking about.

399
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,887
Do you think I'd be
afraid of cop?

400
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,955
This is my
fucking house.

401
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,491
Easy, or I fuck you up!

402
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,195
(door slams)

403
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,197
Marilyn, Marilyn,
don't call the cops.

404
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,899
We need to
get out of here.

405
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,567
Get your stuff.

406
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:35,372
â™ª

407
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,521
(cell phone ringing)

408
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,328
(birds chirping)

409
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,576
(grunting)

410
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:52,382
â™ª

411
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,296
My mother never prepared
her medication herself.

412
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:14,831
Who did then?

413
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:15,732
My wife.

414
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,767
Did she prepare
it that evening?

415
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,102
I guess, yes.

416
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,071
Like every evening.

417
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,672
(man)
The autopsy reports
were conclusive.

418
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:25,108
Your mother died of
an overdose of digoxin...

419
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,043
her heart medication?

420
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:31,581
Did your mother have any
reason to increase her dosage?

421
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,950
Where is your
wife, Mr. Suni?

422
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,819
I don't know,
she's gone.

423
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,387
When?

424
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,858
Just after my
mother died.

425
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,527
Did she tell you
where she was going?

426
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,896
No.

427
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,798
Do you have any reason
to believe

428
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,035
that she increased
the dosage on purpose?

429
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:56,406
No, no-no, she's
not a killer, no.

430
00:37:56,408 --> 00:38:00,443
Did she have anything
against your mother?

431
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,780
There was a lot
of tense between them.

432
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:09,085
We... we couldn't
have children.

433
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,988
Did your mother
beat her?

434
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,256
What?

435
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,991
Did your mother
beat her?

436
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,796
What kind of question
is this?

437
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,697
What do you mean?

438
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,032
I don't understand
your question.

439
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:23,099
It's a question.

440
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,200
Do your mother
beat your wife?

441
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,568
Relax.

442
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,404
Yes or no, did your mother
beat your wife?

443
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,343
You beat your wife?

444
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:36,046
Do you beat
your wife?

445
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:37,414
(woman)
Can you please
excuse us?

446
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,316
I'd like to
see you outside.

447
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,957
Hey, what
time is it?

448
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,726
Why are you pushing
him so hard?

449
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,761
What?
Why are you pushing
him so hard?

450
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,830
It's gonna seem
prejudicial in court.

451
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,498
Well, it's our word
against his.

452
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,200
It doesn't help us.

453
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,635
I don't like him.

454
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,442
Mr. Suni?

455
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,911
Do you have any clue of
your wife's whereabouts?

456
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,846
Could she be with
her family?

457
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,816
She has nobody here,
I'm worried.

458
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,884
She never been
out of Chicago before.

459
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,520
Not even out of her
neighborhood.

460
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,156
Five years, she's never
been out of the neighborhood?

461
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,193
Is that normal?

462
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,428
Um...

463
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,731
C'est la vie.

464
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,769
Are you finished
with me?

465
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,603
Yeah.

466
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,705
We'll be in touch.

467
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:53,056
(percussive music playing)

468
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,145
(music stops)

469
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:16,713
(sighing)

470
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,782
I should have started
ten years ago.

471
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,021
Samia Gamal, she
danced until she was 55.

472
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,090
Really?
Um-hm.

473
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,760
And did you know that she was
married to a Texan billionaire?

474
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,128
When?

475
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,432
In the '50s,
in Egypt.

476
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,333
Their marriage
didn't last long.

477
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:38,568
They divorced.

478
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,637
(chuckling)

479
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,914
I don't know if
I'm gonna get in.

480
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,817
You will.

481
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:57,086
Your choreography should be
special and different.

482
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:14,003
(cell phone ringing)

483
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:35,725
â™ª

484
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,284
(shouting)
Marilyn!

485
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,024
(gasping)

486
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,904
(coughing)

487
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,309
You can't swim?

488
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,211
No.

489
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,547
Why'd you do it?

490
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,882
I don't know.

491
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,254
You gonna file for
a divorce?

492
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:46,195
I don't know.

493
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:51,901
Mourad never stand up
for me in front of his mother.

494
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:57,373
I see my Mother-in-law,
three maybe four times a year?

495
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,310
I can't believe
you actually live with her.

496
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,683
He was so
kind to me.

497
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:11,487
He never hurt me.

498
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,222
I would've killed
myself without him.

499
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,899
Were you in love with him
when you married him?

500
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:31,207
I didn't
know him then.

501
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,777
God.

502
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,514
What difference
does it make?

503
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:45,421
I was crazy about Harvey,
look where it got me.

504
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:47,790
He was
cheating on me.

505
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,397
Are you gonna
divorce him?

506
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:02,472
I don't know.

507
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,807
I don't know how
to forgive him.

508
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:31,134
(cell phone ringing)

509
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,308
We got another gig
for tonight.

510
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:48,017
Let's do it.

511
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,319
Let's do it.

512
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:54,424
â™ª

513
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,993
(man)
â™ª Whoo!

514
00:44:56,995 --> 00:45:01,464
â™ª She didn't bat an eye

515
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:05,802
â™ª As I packed my bags to leave

516
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:10,540
â™ª Thought she would
start to cry

517
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:15,645
â™ª As I turned around
in my room to leave

518
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,614
â™ª But she's the girl

519
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,483
â™ª Fooled me this time

520
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:25,688
â™ª She acted like I was the last
thing on her mind

521
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,424
â™ª But I would like to

522
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:33,296
â™ª Start all over again

523
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:38,134
â™ª Baby, can I
change my mind?

524
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:43,005
â™ª Baby, baby, please do,
yeah

525
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:47,977
â™ª Baby, baby,
please do, yeah

526
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:52,782
â™ª Baby, can I change
my mind?

527
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:57,754
â™ª Baby, baby,
please do, yeah

528
00:45:57,756 --> 00:46:01,457
â™ª Baby, I'm so sorry
watch out!

529
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:07,029
Oh!
(man)
Ladies, on stage!

530
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:10,767
(man)
At this time, in this place

531
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,703
I want y'all to give
it up for two...

532
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:16,773
belly dancers.

533
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:18,875
For the one and only

534
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:23,713
Miss Mona and Miss Marilyn!

535
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,715
(cheering)

536
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:30,920
(music plays)

537
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,795
(cheering)

538
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,134
(man shouting)

539
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:04,647
Come on, girl!

540
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,549
All right, girl.

541
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,952
Let me
help you out here.

542
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:11,621
All right.

543
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,205
(cheering and applause)

544
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,344
(man)
Yeah, go, girl!

545
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,060
(cheering)

546
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:59,168
Give it up for
Mona and Marilyn!

547
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,905
Give it up, Mona
and Marilyn!

548
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:06,909
(cheering and whistling)

549
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,611
(man)
All right.

550
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:12,615
(humming)

551
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,651
Well, little darling.

552
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:16,919
Hey.

553
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:20,823
That's quite a dance
y'all got going on.

554
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:23,859
You do any, uh,
private dancing?

555
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:27,363
Just thought I'd ask,
you know.

556
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,998
What is with
this newspaper?

557
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,299
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

558
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,402
Well, you see I like to look
at them guys eyes.

559
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:37,873
The all got...
different eyes.

560
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,542
You're fucked up.

561
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:41,310
We're all different.

562
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:57,626
(crowd chanting "more")

563
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:59,762
Mona.

564
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:09,505
(man)
Okay, ladies, back on!

565
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,706
On stage!

566
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,708
Come, come, let's go.

567
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,178
I didn't
want to kill her.

568
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,714
It was an accident, I mean,
the pills got mixed up.

569
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:20,950
How am I supposed
to know it was dangerous.

570
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:22,051
And you weren't planning
on telling me?

571
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:23,686
I was.
When?

572
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:24,887
When, Mona?

573
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,188
After we get arrested?

574
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,090
Marilyn, Marilyn,
wait!

575
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,604
You gotta
go to the cops.

576
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:43,773
You gotta tell 'em
what happened.

577
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,511
They won't believe me.

578
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:50,980
I mean, you don't
believe me.

579
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:53,916
I'm-- so scared.

580
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:56,652
I'm-- so scared
to go to jail.

581
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,388
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

582
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,290
You think I wanna spend
the rest of my life in jail?

583
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:03,125
You think I'm not
involved now?

584
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:08,564
You think this isn't
the getaway car, Mona?

585
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,599
We're talkin' about
a murder.

586
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,238
I got enough
fuckin' problems.

587
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,514
Shit.

588
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,757
You're sympathetic
to her

589
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,326
because she was
forced to marry that guy.

590
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:38,928
Yes.
Taken from her family

591
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,098
and humiliated because she can't
bear him children, I get that.

592
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,400
But you seem
to think I'm out to get her.

593
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:46,335
I think you are out
to get her.

594
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:47,570
What if it was
an accident?

595
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:49,939
Well, then why
is she running away?

596
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,208
Look, I just wanna
enforce the law.
Enforce law, I know.

597
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,876
15 years ago
you got a divorce.

598
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:55,144
You left your country.

599
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:56,345
'Cause of the laws
of this country

600
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:57,580
you were able
to start a new life...

601
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:58,948
And that is sacred
to me.

602
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,249
And I get that.

603
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:01,951
I just also think
that you're out to get her.

604
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,586
(woman)
George?
Yep.

605
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:06,355
This gentlemen here wants
to report his wife is missing.

606
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:09,125
Thank you-- come on in.

607
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,794
Uh, I'm sorry,
we don't have any, uh,

608
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:14,163
here, have a seat, please.

609
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:15,898
Is this your wife?

610
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,800
Yeah, like she said.

611
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,436
How-- how long ago
did she go missing?

612
00:52:20,438 --> 00:52:25,074
She... went to work two days ago
and she hasn't been back since.

613
00:52:25,076 --> 00:52:27,443
Oh, and what's
her name?

614
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:28,377
Marilyn.

615
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:29,645
Yeah, Marilyn what?

616
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,647
O'Connor.

617
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:37,620
Did you guys get
into a fight?

618
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:39,321
No more than usual.

619
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:05,481
Do you know what
you're gonna do?

620
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,598
30 bucks.

621
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,316
Is there a bus
that goes through here?

622
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:42,985
In two hours
heading south.

623
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,534
(car door shuts)

624
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,420
Hey.

625
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,660
It's what you made
last night, $160.

626
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,839
No one's gonna look for you
on an Indian reservation.

627
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,584
(car starts)

628
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:04,867
â™ª

629
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:06,895
(cell phone ringing)

630
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,105
Marilyn, it's Harvey.

631
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,648
I'm listening.

632
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,983
<i>Where the hell are you?

633
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:32,554
Jesus Christ, I'm calling
and calling and calling.

634
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,491
I'm freakin' out.

635
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:38,394
I saw you
with her.

636
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:42,965
I loved you,
I trusted you.

637
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:46,068
In our bed Harvey?

638
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:50,472
I fucked up, I fucked up,
okay, it was--

639
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,608
It was stupid,
it was a one-time thing.

640
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,811
It won't happen again.

641
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:59,314
I'm sorry, okay?

642
00:56:59,316 --> 00:57:03,352
You hurt me.

643
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:07,656
You don't
respect me.

644
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,425
I can't do this any more,
it's over.

645
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:19,802
We never did
anything together.

646
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:24,006
Ten years, not
even a child.

647
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:28,510
Ten years wasted.

648
00:57:28,512 --> 00:57:31,513
<i>Sweet bird...

649
00:57:31,515 --> 00:57:33,248
I'm sorry.

650
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,283
We can work this out.

651
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:36,518
Just come back.

652
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,253
<i>We can work this out.

653
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:42,357
You can keep the house
if you can afford the rent.

654
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,460
Keep everything in it.

655
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,131
Goodbye, Harvey.

656
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,600
Don't say that,
don't hang up-- Marilyn...

657
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:53,635
<i>Marilyn, don't okay--</i>
<i>Don't, don't hang up...

00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:27,836
â™ª

663
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,286
I'm so sorry.

664
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,262
Come on.

665
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:59,361
(music playing)

666
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:03,432
(laughing)

667
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:08,837
(Singing in foreign language)

668
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:12,701
You want children?

669
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,303
Yeah.

670
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:18,740
Three,
maybe four.

671
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:21,009
I better hurry up.

672
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:26,114
Nearly 30,
single.

673
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:29,051
You?

674
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:31,787
Me, I can't become
a mother.

675
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:36,525
I... tried
for five years.

676
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,560
Did you see
a doctor?

677
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:40,962
Not really, no.

678
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:43,131
So how do you know
it's you?

679
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,700
Maybe it's
your husband who can't--

680
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:46,468
(scoffing)

681
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:50,072
Men in
my country they always can.

682
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:52,808
Yeah, my Mother-in-law
used to say that.

683
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,715
Maybe you should
try with somebody else.

684
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:00,849
(chuckling)

685
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,217
You're crazy.

686
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,485
I know.

687
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:10,392
You look like you
could be a mother.

688
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:12,828
You think so?

689
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,130
For sure.

690
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:17,165
You'll be a mother
before I am.

691
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,206
If I don't spend
the rest of my life in jail.

692
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:33,482
â™ª

693
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,254
Hello.

694
01:04:19,256 --> 01:04:21,122
Hello.

695
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:23,959
Hey.

696
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:26,528
Hi, I'm Tribal Security.

697
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,495
Is there
a problem?

698
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,130
Yes, this is an Indian
reservation.

699
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,199
You can't be
camping here.

700
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,236
Oh, we didn't know,
I'm sorry.

701
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:35,770
We can
leave right away.

702
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,806
There's no camping allowed
on Indian reservations.

703
01:04:37,808 --> 01:04:39,374
Oh, we didn't know,
I'm sorry.

704
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,876
There is a place
where you can camp.

705
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:42,143
It's off the reservation.

706
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:43,478
It has actual facilities
on there.

707
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,514
Okay, great,
thanks
Okay?

708
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:49,517
Hi, what's your name?

709
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:50,719
Mona?

710
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:53,455
Mona, where
you from Mona?

711
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:56,024
From Chicago.

712
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:58,293
Okay, where y'all
headed to?

713
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:00,061
We just drove
down from Chicago.

714
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:03,832
We're just on a trip,
a road trip.

715
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:05,500
Okay, okay,
that's fine.

716
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:08,003
I can show you where
the campground is.

717
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:09,504
Thanks, that's
great, okay.

718
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:12,674
Yeah, we'll just
pack up our stuff and...

719
01:05:12,676 --> 01:05:14,476
Okay.

720
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:23,418
â™ª

721
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,062
It's beautiful.

722
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:08,263
Yes, here we are.

723
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:10,732
Okay, tomorrow we're
celebrating a feast day

724
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:14,202
and it is our tradition that we
invite a newcomer to our feast.

725
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:15,870
So y'all are welcome
to come.

726
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:18,640
Aw, we'd love to,
thank you.

727
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,108
Okay, great
Thanks.

728
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,010
Well, I'll be back here
tomorrow to pick you up.

729
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:23,678
Great.

730
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,417
Don't worry
he's not a cop.

731
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,464
We closed.

732
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:44,699
I gotta take a piss.
No-no, don't pee
here, okay?

733
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:46,801
No-no, every day
you pee...

734
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:47,969
Go pee somewhere else.

735
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:50,405
Please, enough!

736
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:51,940
Enough, sir!

737
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:54,442
Excuse me,
Mr. Mourad.

738
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,011
Salam.

739
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,848
Question, sir.

740
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,950
Do you recognize
this woman?

741
01:07:01,952 --> 01:07:03,485
Yes, she's a customer.

742
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:05,253
Mona knew her,
they were friends.

743
01:07:05,255 --> 01:07:06,521
Did they hang
out together?

744
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,056
No, never, no-no.

745
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:09,557
Mona went
out only with me.

746
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,726
You know, we'd go buy
some clothes.

747
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:13,395
Or go to the movies.

748
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:14,462
That's it.

749
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:16,331
They call each
other on the phone?

750
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:19,534
No-no, no-no,
here in the shop.

751
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,603
Can you tell us
anything about her?

752
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:25,373
I told you everything
I know.

753
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,275
They were just friendly
to say hello to each other.

754
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:30,078
Yes, that's it, yes.
Okay.

755
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,680
All right,
thank you.
Okay.

756
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:34,015
Good night.

757
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:35,316
As-salam.

758
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:41,156
(music playing)

759
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,245
(music stops)

760
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:08,083
What are you doing?

761
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:12,087
You don't wanna
try with another song?

762
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:14,289
I can't.

763
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,258
You know this one
is a bit...

764
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,827
I don't know.

765
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:20,662
Mona, I don't
have time, it's...

766
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,033
Honey, I've never danced
to this before.

767
01:08:25,035 --> 01:08:26,234
I don't have any steps.

768
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:29,370
Good, just-- just try
to feel the music.

769
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:30,672
But I just don't time
to improvise right now

770
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:32,841
because the audition
is in 48 hours.

771
01:08:32,843 --> 01:08:34,008
I know.

772
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,543
Just feel the music

773
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:38,546
and let your body
decide, you know?

774
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:41,716
It's all about
sexuality.

775
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:44,786
Just let it go.

776
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,127
Are you watching that?

777
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:54,696
Uh-huh.

778
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:56,965
I don't know what
that stuff is.

779
01:08:56,967 --> 01:09:00,368
Some kind of
foreign music.

780
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,704
You know you look for
a little peace and quiet

781
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:04,239
and you get this.

782
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:21,156
If I get this job my whole
life's gonna change, Mona.

783
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:25,927
I get to travel
all over the world.

784
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:29,130
You'll get the job.

785
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:31,466
Now you better get
some sleep.

786
01:09:31,468 --> 01:09:34,135
Tomorrow's a big day.

787
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:35,904
Come on.

788
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,064
(woman)
Hey, hey,
somebody's in here!

789
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:04,232
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

790
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:06,701
I thought the door is,
uh, broken.

791
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:14,509
You can't shake
the door like that.

792
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:17,845
You only know how to get
on people's nerves.

793
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:18,680
I'm sorry.

794
01:10:18,682 --> 01:10:22,483
You and your sand
nigger music.

795
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:24,219
What did you
just say?

796
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:26,821
Oh, another one.
What the fuck did
you just say?

797
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:30,024
Don't give me
any lip.
You bitch.

798
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:32,560
People like you
make me sick.

799
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,062
Small minds!

800
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,864
Small minds.

801
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:38,700
You better do
something about that.

802
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:41,069
All right, all right,
I will.

803
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:43,805
What happened?
She insulted me.

804
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,979
(grunting)

805
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:26,581
Stop!

806
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,283
Stop it!

807
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:29,984
Marilyn!

808
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:31,986
That'll
teach her.

809
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:47,235
(car starts)

810
01:11:47,237 --> 01:11:52,173
(screaming)

811
01:11:52,175 --> 01:11:55,777
Bastards!

812
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:59,881
â™ª

813
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,922
(sobbing)

814
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,999
It's over, Mona.

815
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,000
Excuse me, you
have a cell phone?

816
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:00,535
Yes.

817
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,040
Can I bring it
back to you?

818
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,675
Thank you.

819
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:18,252
(cell phone ringing)

820
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:20,588
Yes.

821
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,192
Mona.

822
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:25,626
Mona, where are you?

823
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,929
Mona, where are you,
the police are looking for you.

824
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,500
I never wanted
to kill Leila

825
01:14:32,502 --> 01:14:34,535
It was
an accident.

826
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:35,770
I know, I know.

827
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:38,306
I know, I'm the one
who wanted to kill her.

828
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:40,374
Please come back,
Mona, okay?

829
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:41,576
I post
the bail for you.

830
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:43,444
You won't go in jail.

831
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:46,147
I'm not afraid to go
to jail, Mourad.

832
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:47,715
<i>I'm selling the store.

833
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,217
We'll leave
Chicago.

834
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:52,820
And we can
adopt children.

835
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,990
We should have done
that before.

836
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:58,459
I'm not gonna
go back to you, Mourad

837
01:14:58,461 --> 01:15:00,728
Why, why, Mona?

838
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,663
I don't care
about children, okay?

839
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,532
I don't care.

840
01:15:04,534 --> 01:15:06,033
She ruin her life
with this.

841
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:09,637
Maybe I'm the one
who can't have them.

842
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:11,739
I never had the courage
to tell her.

843
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:14,709
And I didn't
stand up for you enough.

844
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:16,677
<i>No, you did, I--

845
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:20,748
I loved you,
I loved you.

846
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:24,585
So, so, so let's try again,
okay, somewhere else?

847
01:15:24,587 --> 01:15:26,654
You and me, okay?

848
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:29,490
No Mourad,
it's over.

849
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:33,594
We cannot build a new life
over your mother's death?

850
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:34,829
<i>Why?

851
01:15:34,831 --> 01:15:37,999
Anyway, I'm coming back
to Chicago.

852
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:40,268
I'm gonna turn
myself in, just...

853
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,969
inform the police.

854
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:44,539
<i>No, Mona, don't do that,</i>
<i>don't do that, okay, let--

855
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:45,606
(phone disconnects)

856
01:15:45,608 --> 01:15:48,476
Mona!

857
01:15:48,478 --> 01:15:49,877
Oh.

858
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:33,321
(church bell ringing)

859
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:48,669
(music playing)

860
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,743
Okay, thank you.

861
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:58,112
Okay, O'Connor!

862
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,690
(woman)
Your name please?

863
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:10,691
O'Connor.

864
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:12,293
And where you
from?

865
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:13,527
Chicago.

866
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:15,062
You have two
minutes.

867
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:25,072
(music playing)

868
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,087
This certificate is
for Marilyn.

869
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,388
Okay.

870
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,560
And... would you say goodbye
to her for me?

871
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:28,295
Yes.

872
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:45,946
â™ª

873
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:31,892
Hello, Jack.
Hey.

874
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:32,893
How you doing?

875
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:34,061
Fine, how you doing?

876
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:35,996
She needs a ticket
to Chicago.

877
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,799
The train leaves
in three hours.

878
01:20:38,801 --> 01:20:42,002
I'll get it ready.
Okay.

879
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,672
Okay, Jack's gonna
take care of you.

880
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:45,840
Thank you
for everything.

881
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:47,908
You're welcome.

882
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:54,782
Take care of yourself.

883
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,918
Be safe.

884
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:21,508
â™ª

885
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:07,688
Mona!

886
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:22,236
â™ª

887
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:50,965
You weren't gonna
say goodbye?

888
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:59,707
They'll never believe the dance
they saw today was me.

889
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:02,810
Where you going?

890
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:06,914
Chicago.

891
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:08,983
Then I'm going
with you.

892
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:59,992
