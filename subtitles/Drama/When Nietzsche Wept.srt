1
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,261
<i>Doctor Breuer.</i>

2
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:42,536
<i>I must see you on a
matter of life or death.</i>

3
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,806
<i>Meet me at nine tomorrow
morning at the Cafe Rousse.</i>

4
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,116
A matter of
life or death! H mpf!

5
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,337
Doctor Breuer?

6
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,782
<i>Lou Salome.</i>

7
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,113
How do you do?

8
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,849
May I?

9
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,151
Would you like
a coffee?

10
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,124
<i>Yes, café latte.</i>

11
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,320
<i>Waiter, café
latte, please.</i>

12
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,326
<i>My friend is preparing to kill himself.</i>

13
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,200
This man's death would
have momentous consequences

14
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,671
for me, for you,
for all of the world.

15
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,503
Who is
this friend?

16
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,136
The philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche.

17
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,238
Nietzsche? Should I know of him?

18
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,614
<i>Not yet, but in time we
shall all know of him.</i>

19
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,448
<i>How do we confirm</i>

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,217
<i>a truth that has arrived
through disbelief and skepticism</i>

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,691
and not through some childlike
wishing something were so.

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,729
It is hard to be in God's
hands. It's not truth.

23
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,289
It is a child's wish for the
everlasting blow to the nipple.

24
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,198
<i>We have
evolutionary theory.</i>

25
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:21,468
Evolutionary theory scientifically
demonstrates God's redundancy.

26
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,841
So Darwin himself
had not the courage

27
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,107
to follow
his evidence

28
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,581
to its true
conclusion. So...

29
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,277
where are we?

30
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,321
<i>Surely you must all realize
we have created God...</i>

31
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,185
<i>and all
of us together</i>

32
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,656
have killed him.

33
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,089
<i>God...</i>

34
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,719
is dead.

35
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,955
My friend is sick.

36
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,930
What is the nature
of his illness?

37
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,365
<i>Headaches.
Tormenting headaches.</i>

38
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,197
My dear lady, I will see your friend.

39
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,669
I'm a physician.

40
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,968
<i>I know you can cure
his physical condition.</i>

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,701
That is not
why I am here.

42
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:59,336
<i>Nietzsche suffers
from the deepest despair.</i>

43
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,209
That is what
I ask you to heal.

44
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,512
I cannot
cure despair.

45
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,144
Ah, but you
can, doctor.

46
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,482
I have a spy.

47
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,023
<i>My brother,
a medical student,</i>

48
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,957
attended the class in which
you described a new technique.

49
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,688
The talking cure.

50
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,526
<i>Now I can arrange to steer
Nietzsche to your office</i>

51
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,123
but he must believe you're
treating only his headaches.

52
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,601
Tell me, is yours
a Russian accent?

53
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,194
It is.

54
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,933
Well, perhaps the people in
Russia believe in sorcerers

55
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,100
<i>but sorry, Fraulein,
I am Austrian.</i>

56
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,076
I have no magic
to offer you.

57
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,575
May I walk you back to your hotel?

58
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,844
I would enjoy
that but...

59
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,319
my wife will be watching from
the window. I have a duty.

60
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,548
<i>A duty?</i>

61
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,148
It is my duty to be free of duty.

62
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,889
<i>Doctor, save Nietzsche.</i>

63
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,186
<i>I am sorry.</i>

64
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,313
<i>I had hoped
it was hepatitis.</i>

65
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,254
How long...

66
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,691
do I have?

67
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,253
It is best you put
your affairs in order.

68
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,763
Please, doctor.

69
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,773
How long?

70
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,968
Please. Tell us.

71
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,471
Three to
six months.

72
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,844
<i>Are you alright, doctor?</i>

73
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,980
Make sure the Pfeiffers
are never billed again.

74
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,422
Of course.

75
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,255
Oancel all their
outstanding debts to me.

76
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,521
Of course.

77
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,995
A Fraulein Salome
has suddenly arrived.

78
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,862
A very grand
young woman.

79
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,332
Show her in.

80
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,700
But Frau Reinhardt has
been waiting for hours.

81
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,999
Frau Becker!

82
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,079
Fraulein Salome!

83
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,678
Doctor Breuer.

84
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,485
<i>I see you like to do
things for yourself.</i>

85
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,584
Doesn't that deprive men
the pleasure of serving you?

86
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,629
We both know that
some of the services

87
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,165
men provide are not
necessarily good for women.

88
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,426
The habits
of a lifetime

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,060
are not easily
extinguished, my dear.

90
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,435
<i>Your future husband will
need extensive retraining.</i>

91
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,270
No husband
for me. Ever.

92
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,368
I would not do that to a man.

93
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,393
<i>If then or ever you
use this new technique,</i>

94
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,993
do not attempt to use this
mesmerism method with N ietzsche.

95
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,095
Our patient would refuse
to engage in any process

96
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,800
he perceives as surrendering
his power to another.

97
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,402
And are you responsible
for "our" patient's despair?

98
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,572
He believes
I am.

99
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,705
Where has
God gone?

100
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,771
<i>I shall tell you.</i>

101
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,750
God is dead.

102
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,149
<i>We all have
killed him.</i>

103
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,053
You, you,
you and I.

104
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,784
<i>God will throw you in hell I</i>

105
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,553
<i>After the death
of Buddha,</i>

106
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,186
his shadow was shown
for centuries in caves.

107
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,093
<i>A gruesome,
gruesome shadow.</i>

108
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,825
<i>God will punish you I You are Satan I</i>

109
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,457
Given the way of people

110
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,229
In the caves,
thank you,

111
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,896
for thousands of years, in which
God's shadow will still be shown.

112
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,634
Vanquish the shadow
within yourself!

113
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,700
Friedrich.
Friedrich. Meet Lou Salome.

114
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,236
<i>A brilliant poet
from Russia.</i>

115
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:59,512
Fascinating lecture
to fall on so few ears.

116
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,076
Why are people so
afraid of you, professor?

117
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,716
Oh, truth is
a fearsome thing.

118
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,124
<i>Why do you say
God is dead?</i>

119
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,991
And not that
he never existed?

120
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,689
What you think?

121
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,699
That God has ceased to be a
reckoning force in people's lives.

122
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,702
An interesting
interpretation.

123
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,635
But if God
is dead,

124
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,468
then everything
is permitted.

125
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,533
<i>No morals,
no rules.</i>

126
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,445
<i>Without God, who will
organize our society?</i>

127
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,848
What is the solution to
your godless proposition?

128
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,888
From what stars have we
dropped down to each other here?

129
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,380
Auf Wiedersehen.

130
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,189
<i>I was immediately
attracted to him.</i>

131
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,128
Seduced by
his intellect.

132
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:50,135
<i>We could say so much to each
other with half sentences.</i>

133
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,831
<i>Mere gestures.</i>

134
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,702
<i>He became obsessed,</i>

135
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,140
<i>proposing marriage
after our first meeting.</i>

136
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,644
I was attracted
to him.

137
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,647
<i>But not romantically.</i>

138
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,445
<i>I wanted to learn.</i>

139
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,179
Not to submit.

140
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,720
Stop it!

141
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,279
<i>My refusal turned his love into hatred.</i>

142
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,349
<i>He wrote me these
crazed insulting letters.</i>

143
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,157
Then he wrote about
killing himself.

144
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,029
<i>So if I understand
you correctly,</i>

145
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,932
you want me
to persuade N ietzsche

146
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,766
that his life
is worth living.

147
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,865
But I must accomplish this
without him knowing it.

148
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,570
You are the
only doctor qualified

149
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,875
for this
psychological treatment.

150
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,680
<i>Frau Reinhardt is still
waiting. And still suffering.</i>

151
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,780
<i>One more thing.</i>

152
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,257
<i>You must read
his books.</i>

153
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:07,635
I shall do everything I
can to help your friend.

154
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,615
Good night,
Dr. Breuer.

155
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,781
<i>Good night.</i>

156
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,949
<i>Straight home,
Fishman.</i>

157
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,514
<i>Siegmund? Siegmund?</i>

158
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,611
Where are you
racing to?

159
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,349
The most charming woman in
Vienna invited me for dinner.

160
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,288
Her more charming
husband is

161
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,157
<i>on his way home this very
minute. J ump in, Siggy.</i>

162
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,027
I diagnosed a liver
cancer today.

163
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:40,471
I never get used
to my patients dying.

164
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,066
Well, get used to it, young Dr. Freud.

165
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,858
The children are eating.
Say hello to them.

166
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,755
Daddy!

167
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,165
My little chickens.

168
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,760
See what I
mean, Siggy?

169
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,737
He hardly
talks to me.

170
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,513
Oh, by the way I've
taken on a new patient.

171
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,783
<i>I haven't met him yet.
Suicidal tendencies.</i>

172
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,587
As always, it starts with a woman.

173
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,064
But Josef, love sickness
is not a medical condition.

174
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,794
The story gets
even better.

175
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,699
Because the woman
feels guilty,

176
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,206
she wants me to sneak in a cure
for his psychological distress.

177
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,971
<i>While at the same time, I
address his physical ailments.</i>

178
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,069
Surely, you're not
going to attempt this.

179
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,419
I have
already agreed.

180
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,476
Why?

181
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,819
I don't even
know myself.

182
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,558
Perhaps I need
a challenge like this.

183
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,824
You cannot say
no to this woman.

184
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:17,267
She could persuade
a horse to lay eggs.

185
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,634
<i>Our plan is working.</i>

186
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,766
<i>Dr. Oberbach has persuaded
Nietzsche to consult you.</i>

187
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,471
<i>Neither I
nor Nietzsche</i>

188
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,843
<i>shall ever forget
your kindness.</i>

189
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,149
The professor
is here.

190
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,845
<i>Send him in.</i>

191
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,625
Good day,
Herr Professor.

192
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,527
Please. Please,
have a seat.

193
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,437
Tell me about
your illness.

194
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,309
Would it be
more efficient

195
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,115
to review my
previous consultations?

196
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,990
I'm sure they're excellent
physicians, thank you.

197
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,890
<i>But I make
my own diagnosis</i>

198
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,826
<i>before reviewing
those of my colleagues.</i>

199
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,890
<i>J ust as I prefer to see a
play before reading the reviews.</i>

200
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:48,450
Tell me, professor,
to what extent...

201
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,985
has melancholia accompanied
these migraine attacks?

202
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,658
I have my black periods
but who does not?

203
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,961
Speak not of me

204
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,593
tell me of
my illness.

205
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,001
What it
might be?

206
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,039
A life dominated
by black periods

207
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,903
is a breeding
ground for despair.

208
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,340
Despair?
No.

209
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,844
Perhaps once but not now. No.

210
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,178
I'm just pregnant.

211
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,248
Here.

212
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,981
<i>My headaches are
the labor pains for</i>

213
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,249
my new book.

214
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,290
What book?

215
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,251
<i>Zarathustral</i>

216
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,126
<i>A young prophet,
bursting with wisdom</i>

217
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,132
and courage and truthfulness decides to

218
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,599
<i>enlighten the people.</i>

219
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,397
I teach you
the U bermensch.

220
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,132
Man is something
that must be overcome.

221
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,367
What have you done
to overcome man?

222
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,374
What is the ape to man?

223
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,976
A laughingstock, but I feel no shame.

224
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,575
J ust that, man shall
be to the U bermensch!

225
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,314
People refused to
understand those words.

226
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,983
<i>The prophet, realizing
he has come too soon</i>

227
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,754
<i>returns to
his solitude.</i>

228
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,696
<i>So... like...
Zarathustra,</i>

229
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,997
I come
too soon.

230
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,163
I must ask you
a personal question.

231
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,811
Physical wellbeing
is not separable

232
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,780
from social and
psychological wellbeing.

233
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,478
Is there someone
with whom you have...

234
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,848
You referring
to sex... Doctor?

235
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,289
Well...

236
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,259
I have found that a
flash of bestial pleasure

237
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:34,027
is followed by hours
of self-loathing, so,

238
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,964
such herd pleasures
are not for me.

239
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,869
But is there a woman in your life?

240
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,032
Every time I have
attempted to build

241
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,770
a footbridge to others,
I have been betrayed.

242
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:50,508
<i>First, there was the
composer, Richard Wagner,</i>

243
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,346
I have suffered
because of him,

244
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,887
and later,
my best friend...

245
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,948
with that... woman.

246
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,027
Tell me more
about that... woman.

247
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,324
And why?

248
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,493
<i>It's connected
to your illness.</i>

249
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,468
Trust me
on this.

250
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,064
I cannot afford
to... trust... again.

251
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,509
Then I believe,
Herr Professor,

252
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,341
that we can proceed
no further.

253
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:25,907
Have a safe
journey home, Herr Professor.

254
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,314
Stupid animal!

255
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,156
Hey, out!
Leave the horse alone!

256
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,693
Leave it! Leave it, I tell you!

257
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,626
<i>Are you alright?</i>

258
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,702
Oan we meet... again?

259
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,211
Friday afternoon,
same time?

260
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,550
Good night.

261
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,862
Breathe deeply, Bertha.

262
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,333
Did you have any dreams last night?

263
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:22,739
Yes. I dreamt you
were making love to me.

264
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,775
Really?

265
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,207
Yes.

266
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,370
I'm just going to
examine you, don't worry.

267
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,708
<i>It's perfectly normal.</i>

268
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,715
What are you
doing? No!

269
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,752
I want you!

270
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,150
You are mine!

271
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,151
No, Josef!

272
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,625
No, Josef!

273
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,888
How could you?!

274
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:44,860

275
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,988
What are

276
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,226
That is horrible!
Horrible!!

277
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,499
Dr. Breuer! You are now a free man.

278
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,632
Go back, you syphilitic
whore! He's mine!

Yes. Yes.
You're right.

He interprets any expression

296

you won't hide in your

Excellent books.

Very few copies
of them sold.

315
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,242

for not championing these
with his life's blood.

323
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,762
<i>Due to upsetting events
in your work, your family,</i>

324
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,033
your personal
relationships.

325
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,076
I've given
up teaching.

326
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,576
I have no home
to look after,

327
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:20,771
no wife to
quarrel with,

328
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,177
<i>no children
to discipline.</i>

329
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,738
I have no obligations to anyone.

330
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,249
I have no stress.

331
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,014
<i>Your extreme isolation
is stressing itself.</i>

332
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,851
Great thinkers choose
their own company, no?

333
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,357
<i>U ndisturbed by
the mob.</i>

334
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,826
Oonsider Thoreau,
Spinoza, Buddha.

335
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,453
Professor.

336
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,327
Stress is
our enemy.

337
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:44,802
My task is to help you
reduce stress in your life.

338
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,361
<i>I propose that you
enter my Lauzon clinic</i>

339
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,907
for one month of
observation and treatment.

340
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,000
<i>We have new medications for migraine.</i>

341
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,567
I will visit
you daily.

342
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,945
I'm unable to pay...
for such services.

343
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,179
Money doesn't
matter to me.

344
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,515
It will be free.

345
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,750
And why are you doing this?

346
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,553
You came to
me for help.

347
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,854
I offer it.
I'm a doctor.

348
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,918
Far too simple.

349
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,021
H uman motivation
is far more complex.

350
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,224
What is
your motive?

351
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,096
Why are
you here?

352
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,159
<i>Because of pressure from
my friends and my headaches.</i>

353
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,999
I ask again. What is your motive

354
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,768
if you don't request
payment for such services.

355
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,207
One practices
one's profession.

356
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,369
<i>A cobbler cobbles.</i>

357
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,504
A baker bakes.
A doctor doctors.

358
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,105
<i>Why do you write?
Why philosophize?</i>

359
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,707
You want nothing
from your work.

360
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,446
I do not claim I philosophize for you.

361
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,886
<i>Whereas you, doctor,
continue to pretend</i>

362
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,719
that your motive
is to serve me.

363
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,453
Such claims have nothing
to do with human motivation.

364
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,392
Now what
are your motives?

365
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,691
My motives?

366
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,492
Yes!

367
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,123
My motives?!

368
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,102
Who can answer
such a question?

369
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,535
I believe you
are destined

370
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,038
to become
a great philosopher.

371
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:58,076
My mission is to aid you
in becoming who you are.

372
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,940
So you as my savior
can become even greater?

373
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,410
I did not
say that!

374
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,072
Do you know
my patients

375
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,207
are the leading scientists
and musicians in Vienna?

376
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,978
Yes, and at this moment
you use their eminence

377
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,314
to enhance your
authority with me!

378
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,718
I will never
exploit your name.

379
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,119
I will still be used by you!

380
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,990
Nonsense!

381
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,421
Your charity, your
techniques to help me?

382
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,223
To manage me!

383
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,889
All of these with you
stronger at my expense!

384
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,660
This is a perfect
example of why

385
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,325
you cannot dissect
your own psyche!

386
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,394
Your vision is
blurred, Professor!

387
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,530
You need help!

388
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,234
<i>You are about to make a mistakel</i>

389
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,874
Then go
already!

390
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,117
You crazed
deluded creature!

391
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,176
Shabbat Shalom.

392
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,324
Oome here!

393
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,855
The old Bishop,
N ietzsche,

394
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,828
he's dying
in my hotel!

395
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,353
Get me
some ice!

396
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,858
Dear God!

397
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,724
Bring me
some blankets!

398
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,760
Herr Professor.

399
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,625
<i>Professor Nietzsche.
Friedrich I</i>

400
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,906
Take the pain.
Take the pain in.

401
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,065
You will
feel better.

402
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,472
Help me.

403
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,166
That much chlorine
is a poison

404
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,501
in the sleeping juice
so you could have died.

405
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:52,339
Oh, living, dying,
who cares?

406
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,174
<i>I shall be in your office
tomorrow with what I owe.</i>

407
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,306
Before my train
leaves for Basel.

408
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,145
Basel?

409
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,309
Yes.

410
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,647
Not until this crisis is over.

411
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,314
I'm leaving tomorrow.

412
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,937
You know, part of me holds some...

413
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,073
strange hope that by
helping this bizarre creature

414
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,140
overcome his
own suffering,

415
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,846
<i>I might
defeat my own.</i>

416
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,252
Defeat your suffering?

417
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,416
You're the envy of
every doctor in Vienna.

418
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,483
One feels
things at 40

419
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,222
<i>that one cannot possibly know at 25.</i>

420
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,764
<i>I must stop him
from leaving.</i>

421
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,164
There must
be a way.

422
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,570
Perhaps if you'd fully
disclosed yourself to N ietzsche,

423
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,868
you might have
engaged him.

424
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,071
Once you
gain his trust,

425
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,546
he might open up like a steamed clam.

426
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,285
I think I know
a way, Siggy.

427
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,252
<i>I think I know a way.</i>

428
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,921
Your documents and
receipts, Herr Professor.

429
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,988
Auf Wiedersehen.

430
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,795
Auf Wiedersehen.

431
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,738
<i>Professor Nietzsche.</i>

432
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,606
May I have a word
before you leave?

433
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,483
<i>I have a proposition
to make, Professor.</i>

434
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:50,256
Perhaps never before made
by a doctor to his patient.

435
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,960
I propose a
professional exchange.

436
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:03,133
<i>For one month, I will act
as physician to your body,</i>

437
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,938
if you will act as physician to my mind.

438
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,807
What do
you mean?

439
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,508
That you doctor me and
I teach you philosophy?

440
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,948
No, no, no.

441
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,918
Not teach me.

442
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,352
Heal me.

443
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,650
Of what?

444
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,190
Despair.

445
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,039
I see
no despair.

446
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,374
Not on
the surface.

447
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,038
But underneath,

448
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,515
my mind is invaded
by alien thoughts.

449
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,449
I've lost sight
of why I live.

450
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,648
I'm terrified
of death, yet...

451
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,658
I often think
of ending my life.

452
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,923
I cannot help
you with this.

453
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,463
I've no training.

454
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,123
Who is trained?

455
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,827
Such healing is not a part
of the medical discipline.

456
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,527
What do I know of this?

457
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,231
You know more
than any man alive.

458
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,605
<i>Aren't your books entire
treaties on despair?</i>

459
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:15,703
I can't cure despair. I
only know how to tolerate it.

460
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,305
Then teach me
how to tolerate

461
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,645
a life
of despair.

462
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,582
<i>You were right that
your mission is</i>

463
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:27,922
to save humankind from
illusion and aimlessness.

464
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,722
To create a new code of behavior.

465
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,660
A new morality
free of superstition.

466
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,858
It's all there.
I n your books.

467
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,868
This is my offer.

468
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:41,428
You enter my clinic for 30 days.

469
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,135
I will observe and treat
your medical illness daily.

470
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,236
I n return, you become my physician,

471
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:53,842
and help me talk about
my life's concerns.

472
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,351
<i>Look.</i>

473
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,880
I'm indebted
to you...

474
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,653
more than
any man.

475
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,060
You saved
my life.

476
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,229
I'm just
a writer.

477
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,438
I'm not
a doctor.

478
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,746
You can pay your debt by saving my life.

479
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,976
<i>The way I
saved yours.</i>

480
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,216
So what?

481
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,386
I do this
for you to...

482
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,485
relieve my debt?

483
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,694
My motivation...

484
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,201
is entirely
self-serving.

485
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:52,002
I want to save my life,

486
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,806
but are you strong enough to do this?

487
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,949
<i>I will persuade him</i>

488
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:13,862
that he is the only one who can help me.

489
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,092
And then what?

490
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,930
Then I will
reverse the roles.

491
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,799
He will once again
be the patient

492
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,998
and I will be
the physician.

493
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,041
And what happens
when N ietzsche

494
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,269
turns to you
to cure his despair?

495
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,836
Siggy, I'm convinced there's
something healing in unburdening.

496
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,609
Look at
the Oatholics.

497
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,084
Their priests have been offering
confessions for centuries.

498
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,748
N ietzsche is
a solitary man.

499
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,519
Yet a few
nights ago

500
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,288
he opened up
to me.

501
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,989
A real plea
for help.

502
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,326
Help me.

503
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,095
What you saw were
his unconscious desires.

504
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,933
Those that if they were
liberated could scream

505
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,996
for help
in daylight.

506
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,939
The goal of
my talking cure

507
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,034
is to liberate those
buried desires,

508
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:06,846
to allow the patient to
ask for help... openly.

509
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,182
But is
"liberation" the right term?

510
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,780
Isn't it "integration"
that we are after?

511
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,824
I ntegration of the
unconscious with the conscious.

512
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,160
Yes!

513
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,504
Yes, Sigmund!

514
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:41,941
Very good.

515
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,294
Take a seat.

516
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,366
Remove your stethoscope.

517
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,365
And your coat.

518
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,842
<i>As well.</i>

519
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,555
<i>I made a list
of your complaints.</i>

520
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,151
One, you have a
general unhappiness.

521
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,460
<i>Two, you're besieged
by alien thoughts.</i>

522
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,228
<i>Three, self-hatred.</i>

523
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:33,964
<i>Four, fear of aging.
Five, fear of death.</i>

524
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:38,338
<i>Six, urges
toward suicide.</i>

525
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,569
Anything else?

526
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:44,604
I feel...

527
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,775
completely...

528
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,682
remote and distant
from my wife.

529
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,745
<i>Trapped in a world
not of my own choosing.</i>

530
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,657
And is that one more problem or two?

531
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,095
You make me
feel uncomfortable.

532
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,256
It is my task to make
you feel comfortless.

533
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,360
No, no, no. Your approach is all wrong.

534
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,867
M r. Breuer, we made an agreement.

535
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,334
"M r." Breuer?

536
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:17,074
Do you want us to proceed, M r. Breuer?

537
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,787
<i>You've mentioned
your wife last.</i>

538
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,661
Which tells me
it begins there.

539
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,633
<i>What initiated
this change...</i>

540
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,067
in your feelings
toward her?

541
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,667
Two years ago I took on
the case of a young woman.

542
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,976
This patient
- I gave her the pseudonym Anna O...

543
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:55,508
<i>Suffers from what we doctors
call hysterical behavior.</i>

544
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,353
Try to stay calm!

545
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,119
<i>During our
daily meetings, she...</i>

546
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,924
<i>opened up to me. She had the
details of every disturbing event</i>

547
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,988
<i>of the last 24 hours.</i>

548
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:12,001
She called these confessions
"chimney-sweeping."

549
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,874
I prefer to call it...
the talking cure.

550
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,844
<i>U nfortunately,</i>

551
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,473
the course of treatment was terminated

552
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,880
<i>by its insane ending.</i>

553
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,178
How?

554
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:30,379
I fell in love
with my patient.

555
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:34,413
<i>She and her mother were
friendly with my wife.</i>

556
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,520
Bertha.

557
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,902
What's wrong?

558
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:45,867
Stop it, Bertha!

559
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,531
What's wrong?

560
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,907
I'm pregnant!

561
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,377
I'm pregnant with
your husband's baby!

562
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,275
Bertha!

563
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:05,914
<i>Here comes Dr.
Breuer's little baby I</i>

564
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,619
<i>Berthal Nol Stop it I</i>

565
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:13,425
Stop it!
Bertha!

566
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:17,297
It was her delirium speaking,
of course, her illness.

567
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,802
<i>But my wife forbade me to see her again.</i>

568
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,531
What did
you do?

569
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,473
<i>I'm sorry, my dear. I cannot
be your doctor anymore.</i>

570
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,737
But I've done
nothing wrong.

571
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,406
Of course
you haven't.

572
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,278
I will refer you to a colleague of mine.

573
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,251
He will take good care of you.

574
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,946
Please don't
let me go.

575
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,353
I have no choice.

576
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,160
You will always be the
only man in my life. Always.

577
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:56,332
<i>Can you imagine how terrible
it was to hear those words?</i>

578
00:37:56,407 --> 00:38:01,743
They were evidence of
the damage I had done.

579
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:06,044
I left her weakened.

580
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,846
Orippled.

581
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:14,118
<i>You are responsible for all
of your thoughts and deeds.</i>

582
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:18,992
But she, by virtue
of the so-called illness,

583
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,655
she is exonerated.

584
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,358
<i>From everything.</i>

585
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,129
Who has
damaged whom?

586
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,601
Who has
weakened whom?

587
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:33,974
Doesn't this cripple
Bertha, as you call her...

588
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:39,843
have greater power
over you?

589
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,942
<i>An excellent beginning.</i>

590
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,510
<i>He even developed
a list of my problems.</i>

591
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,389
<i>Breuer is
a curious mix.</i>

592
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,586
<i>I ntelligent yet blind.</i>

593
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,492
<i>Sincere but devious.</i>

594
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,760
<i>Let him continue to think
that this is what we are doing.</i>

595
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,769
<i>He's possessed by a woman
who shreds him to pieces.</i>

596
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,534
<i>And he
licks her bloody fangs.</i>

597
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,074
<i>I love it, Josef.</i>

598
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,476
What do you love?

599
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,571
Tchaikovsky!

600
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:11,706
Why?

601
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,374
<i>Swan Lakel</i>

602
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,394
Josef, look! We're running out of time!

603
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,205
Backwards!
Look at the time!

604
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,536
Faster, Josef!
Pedal faster!

605
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:45,343
Take me, Josef.
Take me!

606
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,317
<i>Throw away
your shacklesl</i>

607
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,854
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

608
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,583
but death will
never hurt me!

609
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:14,975
<i>I feared that after
yesterday's confessions,</i>

610
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,478
you would
think less of me.

611
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:20,483
Do not worry about what
others think of you.

612
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,179
I suspect you find
sex disagreeable.

613
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,188
I do not object to sex.

614
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,690
What I hate is the man who begs for it.

615
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,226
He surrenders himself
to some crafty woman

616
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,956
who turns his lust
into her strings.

617
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,622
Lust is part
of life!

618
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,326
And nothing must interfere
with the development

619
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,959
of the hero which is inside you!

620
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:42,972
And if lust stands in the
way, lust must be overcome!

621
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,439
Be more practical.

622
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,272
All you give me are
quotes from your books!

623
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:51,838
<i>First time I've attempted to put
my philosophy to practical use.</i>

624
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:56,319
<i>Choose between comfort
and the truth.</i>

625
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,218
<i>Are they
mutually exclusive?</i>

626
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,553
If you want to choose
the pleasure of growth,

627
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,285
prepare yourself
for some pain.

628
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,827
Less pain, shrink. Go.
Be part of the herd.

629
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,527
Look at
this tree.

630
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,695
<i>It requires
stormy weather</i>

631
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,035
if it is to attain
its proud height.

632
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:20,406
<i>Learn, creativity
and discovery.</i>

633
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,070
But they
come in pain!

634
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,575
<i>I wish for simple things.</i>

635
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,314
<i>To sleep without nightmares</i>

636
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:34,152
To live
without tension.

637
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,525
Lie down.

638
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:41,753
Why?

639
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,426
It's the
best inducement

640
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,403
for recalling memories.
Lie down, please.

641
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,910
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

642
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,944
Let us
imagine

643
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,116
<i>An icy
mountain peak.</i>

644
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,719
And we see this little
man trudging to the top.

645
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,423
<i>He's looking into the
horror of his existence.</i>

646
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,365
<i>He is encountering
times that are endured.</i>

647
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,401
<i>But he sees
too much.</i>

648
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:26,637
<i>This insignificance,
this mere little speck</i>

649
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,109
<i>that he is.</i>

650
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,246
<i>And now his fear
becomes so raw,</i>

651
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:37,048
that he welcomes
lust into his mind.

652
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,113
<i>And he starts looking
into this castle.</i>

653
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,682
<i>He begins to spend his time
recollecting these miracles.</i>

654
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,889
<i>How his little
crippled Bertha</i>

655
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,797
<i>moves her legs.</i>

656
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,700
<i>Her lips.</i>

657
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,261
<i>And her arms.</i>

658
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,035
<i>And her breasts.</i>

659
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,269
<i>And his mind</i>

660
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:04,303
which was filled with
the noblest of ideas

661
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:10,149
<i>becomes clogged
now with trash.</i>

662
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,688
<i>And that is how
he is today.</i>

663
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,749
<i>He's just rummaging
through the rubbish.</i>

664
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,852
<i>Of Bertha.</i>

665
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,524
<i>As if it contained the
answer to his prayers.</i>

666
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:29,268
<i>Well, what do you think of this man?</i>

667
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,436
Josef, open
your eyes.

668
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,410
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

669
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,287
Talk to me,
Josef.

670
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,299
This is
my way.

671
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,062
Where is yours?

672
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,743
He asked you to lie
on the couch? Why?

673
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,283
He said it was the best
way for recalling memories.

674
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,080
I nteresting.

675
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,123
<i>He is honoring
his contract,</i>

676
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,748
<i>but offers
no support.</i>

677
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,656
My confessions have failed to produce

678
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,195
even the slightest admission
of his own obsession.

679
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,823
Is your frustration rooted
in your competition with him?

680
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,891
Not at all.

681
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,403
I'm a physician,
Siggy.

682
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,167
I do not meet with my
patient for my pleasure.

683
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,903
But Josef, I've read his books.

684
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,172
<i>He has more penetrating
knowledge of mankind</i>

685
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,875
than any other person. I
think, he may be, perhaps

686
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,247
the greatest psychologist
who has ever lived.

687
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,345
You can best help him
by letting him help you.

688
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,461
Josef?

689
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,439
<i>Josef? It's
after midnight.</i>

690
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,112
Are you coming
to bed?

691
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:25,841
Soon.

692
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,899
<i>Dr. Breuerl Dr. Breuerl</i>

693
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,700
<i>Dr. Breuerl</i>

694
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:50,933
Where is
my wife?

695
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,101
<i>Your wife...
is in the housel</i>

696
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,371
Mathilde!

697
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,757
<i>Mathildel</i>

698
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,590
<i>You'll always be
the only man in my life.</i>

699
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,220
<i>Always.</i>

700
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:18,599
<i>You'll never
regret it, Josef. Never.</i>

701
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,039
You will never regret it, Josef. Never.

702
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,186
I feel healthy.

703
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,022
I wish to waste none
of our precious time

704
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,028
on these physical
exams, hm?

705
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,628
U h, before
we begin,

706
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:55,900
the last time we met
you called me "Josef."

707
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,875
I like that. Should we use first names?

708
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,878
Friedrich or...?

709
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,612
Fritz.

710
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,281
Friedrich.

711
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,658
My best friend at school
was called Friedrich.

712
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,960
<i>He used to call me the
lad of infinite promise.</i>

713
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:25,126
What happened
to the lad?

714
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,965
He became
a successful doctor.

715
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:30,268
<i>And respected.
And rich.</i>

716
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,175
Then you have
fulfilled your goals.

717
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,679
You are satisfied?

718
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,149
I have fulfilled
my goals, yes.

719
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,345
Am I satisfied?

720
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,513
No.

721
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,285
How did you
choose your goals?

722
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:54,290
<i>No, don't... don't think.
J ust chimney-sweep.</i>

723
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,592
H m.

724
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:00,834
Goals are
part of my culture.

725
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,499
They're in the air. You breathe them in.

726
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:06,474
<i>Like every
young Jewish boy,</i>

727
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:10,274
<i>I wanted to climb out
of the ghetto to succeed.</i>

728
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,781
<i>My father was the great
teacher of my life.</i>

729
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,148
No, Papa.

730
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,347
No, Josef. I won't encourage bad habits.

731
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,299
But I never
chose goals.

732
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,096
They were
just there, like...

733
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:33,500
like an accident.

734
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,834
And yet not to take
possession of your goals

735
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:39,273
is just that, let your
life be an accident.

736
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,552
<i>What is
wrong, Josef?</i>

737
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:57,582
I've had a sudden and painful
understanding of the obvious.

738
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,891
<i>Time is irreversible.</i>

739
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,693
The sands of my life
are running out,

740
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:07,100
I'm in lockstep with all people
marching towards my death.

741
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,469
<i>So you see clear
vision as a wound.</i>

742
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,633
Knowing that as
my death approaches,

743
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,542
I'm impotent and
insignificant, yes.

744
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,705
That does not mean that
existence has no purpose.

745
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,249
<i>On the contrary. As death creeps closer,</i>

746
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,784
<i>the value
of life increases.</i>

747
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,717
<i>You must learn
to say "Yes," Josef.</i>

748
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:26,347
But say "yes" to every minute of life.

749
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:29,221
Be passionate. Be a
free thinking spirit.

750
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,089
Rise above
your limitations.

751
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:35,894
Be the U bermensch.
H m? Please.

752
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,901
Please, Fraulein. Will you take a seat?

753
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,739
The Russian
is here.

754
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,805
Let her wait.

755
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:06,757
Good afternoon, Frau
Pettik. Please take a seat.

756
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,230
<i>Herr Schubert,
hello.</i>

757
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,563
Take a seat. The doctor
will be with you shortly.

758
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,466
<i>Please, understand.
I'm very sorry.</i>

759
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,334
<i>Please, the doctor
will see you.</i>

760
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:26,779
<i>Frau Pettik, the doctor can see you now.</i>

761
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,824
What a pleasure.

762
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,728
<i>I had forgotten.</i>

763
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,699
Then look more carefully this time.

764
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:48,795
I'm distressed at having
so little time to offer you.

765
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,601
The price of success, Dr. Breuer.

766
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,448
You like to
live dangerously.

767
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,547
<i>Tell me, why
didn't you write</i>

768
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,787
so that I could arrange
a proper time for you?

769
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,591
I am concerned
about our patient.

770
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,392
<i>Our patient?</i>

771
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,399
Have you graduated
from medical school

772
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,832
since our
last meeting?

773
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,803
You must read these
letters N ietzsche sent me.

774
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,737
He writes
as if to punish me.

775
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,004
<i>"You are a woman without
sensitivity or spirit,</i>

776
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:31,377
incapable of love, a preditor
clothed as a house cat."

777
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,076
<i>Why does he regard me as such a monster?</i>

778
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:40,250
I deserve to know the
outcome of my efforts.

779
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,315
The outcome
of your experiment.

780
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:47,420
<i>It's been lovely
to see you,</i>

781
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,226
but I must return to my work.

782
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,391
Where is he?

783
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,661
I cannot tell you.

784
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,225
<i>Or the state
of his condition.</i>

785
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:54,668
You turn your back to me.

786
00:52:55,338 --> 00:53:00,469
<i>I cannot violate
my patient's... privacy.</i>

787
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,754
<i>Perhaps you are not capable</i>

788
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,486
<i>of being hypnotized.</i>

789
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,586
<i>Perhaps.</i>

790
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:22,928
I didn't tell you she left some
of N ietzsche's letters with me.

791
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,398
H m. And?

792
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,903
He berates me for feeding
at the trough of lust,

793
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:31,372
<i>and all the while, he
himself, just like me,</i>

794
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:37,073
is rummaging through the
trash of his own mind.

795
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:40,480
You think he should answer
for his falsifications,

796
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,142
may I remind you
of your own.

797
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,586
Of the deceptive premise of
your arrangement with him.

798
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,860
<i>Of the two patients
in this relationship,</i>

799
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:55,455
I have become
the more urgent case.

800
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,835
General.

801
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,004
What are you
doing, soldier?

802
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,774
Trying to kill
myself, sir.

803
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,246
Oarry on, soldier.

804
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,112
Yes, sir.

805
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,951
General, help me please!

806
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,757
The interesting thing
is that in my dream

807
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,893
the general
was you.

808
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,634
And why me?

809
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,505
A symbol of your
unwillingness to join me

810
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,273
in a down-to-earth
manner perhaps?

811
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,474
Be open
with me.

812
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,380
I presume that,
like all men,

813
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,681
you've suffered
from love-sickness.

814
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:58,517
Have you ever tasted
the pain of love?

815
00:54:58,595 --> 00:54:59,857
Yes.

816
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,428
And?

817
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:05,795
I must know.

818
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:09,703
Let me remind you
of Goethe's words.

819
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:13,402
"Be a man.
Do not follow me,

820
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,909
<i>but yourself. "</i>

821
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,947
Teaching philosophy and
using it in the real world

822
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,812
are very
different undertakings.

823
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:23,011
You wish for something
to soothe you now.

824
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,351
<i>Then go, suckle on the
teat of superstition.</i>

825
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:29,119
<i>Whatever you do,
don't go to reason.</i>

826
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,820
U nfortunately, the
theatrical director of my mind,

827
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,489
the one who stages all
these scenes with Bertha

828
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,293
is unaffected
by reason.

829
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,334
<i>Of course not. For
what reason will a man</i>

830
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:39,891
could love
such a cripple?

831
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,231
<i>Oh, stop it I</i>

832
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:43,932
Bertha is intelligent,
beautiful, loving!

833
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,235
<i>Loving?
How?</i>

834
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,276
She tried to seduce you into adultery.

835
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,710
<i>She almost
destroyed you.</i>

836
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,406
You are too
hard on her.

837
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:52,743
Well, next time
you go to her,

838
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:55,114
don't forget
to bring your whip.

839
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,245
Yes. I think to love such
a woman is to hate life.

840
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,983
Bertha is
a fine woman.

841
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,786
May I remind you
she became ill

842
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,417
because of her
father's death?

843
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,894
And may I remind
you all fathers die?

844
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,023
<i>I think the time
for excuses is over.</i>

845
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,937
<i>You will always
be the only man in my life.</i>

846
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,879
<i>Friedrich, I need your help.</i>

847
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,145
<i>Attack my obsession.
It's ruining mel</i>

848
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,619
Do you want war?

849
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,053
Yes!

850
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,387
You will follow my
directives without question.

851
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,447
Absolutely.

852
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,891
Sit.

853
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,322
Please.

854
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,131
Olose your eyes.

855
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:52,331
<i>I magine... your life...
with Bertha.</i>

856
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,899
But I don't
want to!

857
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,468
Please, Josef.
Relax.

858
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,952
Now, you're
starting your day.

859
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:09,424
<i>You're having your
breakfast, with Anna O.</i>

860
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:15,453
<i>I want you to compose
a list of 10 insults</i>

861
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,363
and I want you to hurl them at her.

862
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,197
To her face?!

863
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,361
Yes.

864
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,929
What?
Like "ugly?"

865
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,770
Precisely.

866
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:26,831
Ugly, yes.

867
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,477
Ugly.

868
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,039
Scream it out!

869
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,113
Ugly!

870
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,747
Stupid!
Oow!

871
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,290
Whore!
Sow!

872
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:45,157
Oross-eyed! Monster! Oripple!

873
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:48,220
That's nine.
One more.

874
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,597
Idiot!!

875
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,159
Good. How is
she responding?

876
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:55,226
I love you.

877
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,499
Banish the tranquil idea
you've composed.

878
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:03,034
<i>See Bertha as she would
be now each morning.</i>

879
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:06,707
<i>Spasms. Her arms
and legs in spasms.</i>

880
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,809
<i>Cross-eyed. M utant. Hallucinating.</i>

881
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,148
<i>Suffering I</i>

882
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:27,169
See her as the infant
she longs to revert to.

883
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,705
<i>See her as an adult,
sitting on the toilet</i>

884
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:41,045
<i>as she does
each day.</i>

885
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:46,020
Ooh. H i, Josef.

886
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,956
<i>If you are alone and you
begin to think of her,</i>

887
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,858
tell her "Go away, I hate
you!" as loud as you can.

888
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,897
You pinch yourself as
hard as you can! Say it!

889
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,158
Go away!

890
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,757
<i>Pinch yourselfl
Pinch yourselfl</i>

891
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,564
Pinch yourself as hard as you can!

892
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,127
Go away!
I hate you!

893
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,433
Listen. If you're
ever alone

894
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,440
and you begin to think
about her, shout

895
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:09,069
"Go away, I hate you" as loud
as you can. Say it. I hate you.

896
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:09,941
I hate you!!

897
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:10,741
I hate you!

898
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:11,507
I hate you!!

899
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:12,309
I hate you!

900
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,610
I hate you!!

901
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,584
<i>Louderl Say it. I hate you.</i>

902
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:20,384
Say it! Josef, if you are ever
alone, you begin to think of her,

903
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,516
you shout "Go away, I hate
you" as loud as you can. Say it.

904
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:25,584
As loud as you can.
Say it. I hate you.

905
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,222
Go... away!!
I hate you!!

906
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,129
<i>I love you.</i>

907
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,326
<i>Go away I I hate you I</i>

908
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,139
What are we waiting for, Fishman?

909
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,648
<i>Yeah, hol</i>

910
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:25,516
H m.

911
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:29,024
Your heart
is strong.

912
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,060
But mine is close to bursting.

913
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,898
<i>After yesterday, I feel like
a bear being trained to dance.</i>

914
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:43,132
It's true. I've lowered you. And myself.

915
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:46,573
<i>And a teacher should be a raiser of men.</i>

916
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,304
We are
missing something.

917
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:52,109
<i>Yes, we've neglected to
understand the meaning</i>

918
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:55,014
behind your obsession.

919
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,552
How can we discover
the meaning of something

920
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,588
that I myself
have concealed?

921
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,147
By talking
about it.

922
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,950
<i>What would your life be
if there was no Bertha?</i>

923
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:10,294
Life without Bertha...

924
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:12,391
would be
a colorless one.

925
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:13,935
Everything would
be decided.

926
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:18,633
This medical bag,
these black clothes.

927
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:22,109
I'm a scientist. Yet
science has no color.

928
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,807
I need passion!

929
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,873
I need magic!

930
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,754
That's what
Bertha represents.

931
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:36,417
Life without passion,
without mystery?

932
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:40,258
<i>Who can live
such a life?</i>

933
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,893
But he is
expecting me.

934
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:52,240
You're lured to mystery.
You're lured to danger.

935
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,435
But I hate danger.

936
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,104
I live my
life safely.

937
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,307
Living safely
is what's dangerous.

938
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,943
Living safely
is dangerous?

939
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:06,250
N ietzsche, there is no
Professor N ietzsche here.

940
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:07,550
Oheck again.

941
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:10,148
There is no Professor N ietzsche here.

942
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:27,970
Perhaps Bertha represents
my desire to escape

943
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:31,036
my deadly safe life,
the trap of time.

944
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:33,674
<i>Time is our
burden, Josef.</i>

945
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,116
The greatest challenge
is to live in spite of it.

946
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:55,499
<i>I hate women
with lips.</i>

947
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,300
Why do you
show me this?

948
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:00,467
<i>Because she has a combination of lips,</i>

949
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,411
<i>eyes and breasts...</i>

950
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,142
that give her almost
superhuman powers.

951
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,510
Powers to
do what?

952
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,384
When I'm
with her,

953
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:18,860
<i>I feel that I'm in the
center of an orderly,</i>

954
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:23,126
tranquil universe.

955
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,191
An intensely
beautiful place

956
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:31,400
where there are no questions
about life or purpose.

957
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,339
<i>Like walking
on clouds.</i>

958
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,080
<i>Where do your
thoughts go now?</i>

959
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:54,161
<i>Her eyes...
they glisten.</i>

960
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,027
<i>She doesn't speak,</i>

961
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:57,690
<i>yet she talks
to me.</i>

962
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,359
And what does
she say?

963
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,266
She says...

964
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,271
"Josef,

965
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,741
you are adorable."

966
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:15,148
And in that moment, I am.

967
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,623
<i>When she told me
one day that she</i>

968
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,685
dreamed of us making
love, I was ecstatic.

969
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,787
<i>What a victory.</i>

970
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:35,801
To enter a place where
no man has ever been.

971
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,877
Have you ever known
a Bertha, Frederich?

972
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,382
<i>Friedrich.</i>

973
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,826
I once knew a woman who
could not be denied. Yes.

974
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,066
Tell me more
about this woman.

975
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:19,875
<i>What was
her name?</i>

976
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,283
<i>Do you still
love her?</i>

977
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,027
<i>We are more
in love with desire,</i>

978
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,924
than the desired.

979
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:41,421
<i>Siggy.</i>

980
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,089
These sessions
with N ietzsche

981
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,564
have become the center of my day.

982
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,566
Why?

983
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,236
The relief
of disclosure.

984
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,873
<i>Perhaps in 50 years
this talking cure</i>

985
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:57,845
might develop into
a precise science.

986
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,285
I thought I could help him.

987
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,547
<i>No longer.</i>

988
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,748
<i>He has everything
to offer me.</i>

989
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,918
I'm wondering if part
of this talking cure

990
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:16,192
involves learning with the
patient transfers to his doctor.

991
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,459
Shh.

992
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:22,569
<i>What would it be to
live as Nietzsche lives?</i>

993
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,233
<i>No house.</i>

994
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,243
<i>No obligations.</i>

995
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:32,405
<i>No wife.
No responsibilities.</i>

996
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:12,110
<i>"Goodbye, my dear Lou.</i>

997
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:13,621
<i>"I won't see
you again.</i>

998
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:19,251
"You've caused damage.
You've done harm.

999
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:22,422
And not only to me, but to
all people who loved me."

1000
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,932
<i>"And this
sword hangs over you.</i>

1001
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,197
<i>But I hope you will make good to Henry,</i>

1002
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,431
<i>what you couldn't
make good to me.</i>

1003
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,266
<i>Yesl</i>

1004
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:41,477
You make music sick.

1005
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,610
You are sick!
You are sick!

1006
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,104
Wagner.

1007
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,942
The first requiems.

1008
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:32,158
<i>You make music sickl</i>

1009
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:36,762
<i>You tyrant I
You tyrant I</i>

1010
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,034
<i>You antisemitel</i>

1011
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:40,939
<i>I hate you I</i>

1012
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:44,005
<i>I hate you I</i>

1013
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:14,404
<i>Wagner. You make music sick.</i>

1014
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,302
Hate.
Hate.

1015
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,074
Hate.

1016
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,137
Fritz.

1017
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,314
Fritz.

1018
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:26,810
<i>Hate.</i>

1019
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:27,878
Fritz!

1020
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:28,889
Hate!

1021
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,152
Look at me!

1022
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,784
Talk to my animals.

1023
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,918
Fritz!

1024
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,437
<i>Hate.</i>

1025
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:15,201
<i>I visit my
parents' grave once a month.</i>

1026
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,638
<i>Would you like to come with me today?</i>

1027
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,369
<i>It's less than one
hour's ride from the city.</i>

1028
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,550
Why didn't you tell me your
mother's name was Bertha?

1029
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,359
She died when I was three.

1030
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,721
I have very few
memories of her.

1031
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:47,792
No conscious memories.

1032
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:50,498
<i>Are you suggesting
I love Bertha</i>

1033
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,904
because she and my mother
shared the same name?

1034
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:02,147
My mother is hardly real to me.

1035
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,345
Bertha Pappenheim is the
most real thing in my life.

1036
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:07,753
I think your obsession with Bertha

1037
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,314
<i>has never been
about Bertha.</i>

1038
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,054
A year after my father
died, I had a dream.

1039
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:15,688
<i>This grave opens,</i>

1040
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,324
<i>and my father
rises up,</i>

1041
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,664
<i>and he runs
to this church.</i>

1042
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:22,499
<i>It's where
he preached.</i>

1043
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:26,940
<i>And he grabbed
this small child,</i>

1044
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,570
<i>and he climbed back...</i>

1045
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,943
<i>into the grave.</i>

1046
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,278
<i>I always believed
that this dream</i>

1047
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,079
<i>predicted my
brother's death, but</i>

1048
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:38,881
I suspect it
was my own...

1049
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,683
it was my
own fear.

1050
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:44,984
I was
that boy.

1051
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,461
I n my
father's arms.

1052
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:53,058
<i>And fear is expressed in
your dream where you...</i>

1053
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:57,367
<i>plunge towards
the closed coffin.</i>

1054
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,304
<i>Who is inside
the coffin?</i>

1055
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:03,834
I don't remember.

1056
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:07,040
<i>Who is the one who
stops you from falling</i>

1057
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:08,481
<i>to your death?</i>

1058
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:12,420
<i>Your crippled Bertha?</i>

1059
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,515
<i>Or perhaps
your mother?</i>

1060
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,819
<i>The real Bertha.</i>

1061
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,457
<i>Who, Josef?</i>

1062
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,864
<i>Who is inside
the coffin?</i>

1063
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,279
I can still
see her face.

1064
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,011
She's smiling
at me.

1065
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:44,984
<i>H m.</i>

1066
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,147
<i>Your mother?</i>

1067
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:00,900
How could she
leave me?

1068
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,812
I never really
let her go.

1069
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:22,318
Perhaps adult figures enter a
child's mind and refuse to leave.

1070
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:33,565
But you must be as
frightened as I am of death...

1071
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,535
and godlessness.

1072
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:42,503
We must die. But at the right time.

1073
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,604
<i>Death only loses its terror when one has</i>

1074
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:48,206
<i>consummated one's life.</i>

1075
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:51,184
<i>Have you consummated your life?</i>

1076
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:54,154
I have achieved
a great deal.

1077
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,588
But have you
lived your life?

1078
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:58,717
<i>Or have you been lived by it?</i>

1079
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:02,924
<i>You stand outside
your life, grieving,</i>

1080
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:07,526
for some life
that you...

1081
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:08,900
you never lived.

1082
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,371
<i>I cannot change
my lifel</i>

1083
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,308
I have my family,
my patients!

1084
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:18,505
Students.

1085
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:19,877
It's too late.

1086
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,542
I cannot tell you how
to live differently.

1087
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:25,246
If I did, you'd still be
living by some other's design,

1088
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,414
but perhaps I could
give you a gift, Josef.

1089
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,721
Maybe I could give
you a thought.

1090
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,125
What if some demon
were to say to you

1091
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:37,893
that this life,
as you now live it,

1092
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,957
have lived it
in the past,

1093
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:43,994
you would have to live
once more but...

1094
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,506
innumerable times more.

1095
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:51,239
There will be nothing new in it.

1096
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:55,613
Every pain, every joy, every
unutterably small or great thing

1097
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:58,915
in your life would
just return to you.

1098
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:03,822
The same succession, the same
sequence, again and again,

1099
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,122
like an hourglass
of time.

1100
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:09,391
I magine infinity.

1101
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:14,993
Oonsider the possibility that
every action you choose, Josef,

1102
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:20,098
you choose
for all time.

1103
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:25,579
Then all... unlived life

1104
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:29,708
would remain...
inside you.

1105
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:35,620
<i>U nlived.
Throughout eternity.</i>

1106
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,488
You like
this idea?

1107
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:42,462
Do you hate it? Which?

1108
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:43,964
I hate it!

1109
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,693
Why?

1110
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:51,364
The only thing
I love about my life

1111
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:56,139
is the thought

1112
01:16:56,211 --> 01:17:00,773
that I have fulfilled my
duties to my wife and children.

1113
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:04,876
Duty?

1114
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,284
Your duty
is a sham.

1115
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:09,722
It's the curtain
you hide behind.

1116
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,316
<i>To truly build
your children,</i>

1117
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:16,194
you build
yourself. First.

1118
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:20,166
And as for your wife, let her break
out from this prison you share.

1119
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:21,566
And be
broken by it.

1120
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,036
<i>H m?</i>

1121
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,365
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

1122
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:32,303
<i>To continue with the sense
that I have not lived.</i>

1123
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:36,818
That I have not
tasted freedom.

1124
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,220
The idea fills
me with horror.

1125
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,462
Help me, Siggy.

1126
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,280
Fly! Fly!

1127
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:18,259
Fly! You're free! You're free!

1128
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:23,225
And you too
are free.

1129
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:32,863
<i>Free them?</i>

1130
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:34,772
<i>This is madness.</i>

1131
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,277
Suddenly I find
that I am old.

1132
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:40,314
I am facing death without
having lived my life!

1133
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,579
<i>Since when is there
your life and my life?</i>

1134
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:46,553
We made a covenant
to share our lives.

1135
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,383
Leave if you want!

1136
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:55,294
But not until I tell you about
the cruel joke of freedom.

1137
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,558
I wish I had
your freedom.

1138
01:18:57,632 --> 01:19:00,100
Freedom of a man to obtain an education.

1139
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,965
To choose
a profession.

1140
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:04,028
I wish I had the vocabulary, the logic

1141
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:06,939
to express just how foolish you sound!

1142
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:10,102
<i>Mathilde, if I am able to find my life</i>

1143
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,975
we will both
be better off.

1144
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,277
Perhaps I will come back to this life.

1145
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:16,146
But it must be
my choice!

1146
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:19,745
Have you forgotten about the
choice you made in marrying me?

1147
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:22,483
What choices does a deserted wife have?

1148
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:25,424
You are young,
rich, attractive!

1149
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:26,961
You will be as free as I am!

1150
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,825
We have
three children!

1151
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:34,130
<i>Mathilde, I should have
been I before I became we!</i>

1152
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:37,797
Words! Words! You cannot live in words!

1153
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,570
I choose
my life, too.

1154
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:42,871
And I choose
to tell you

1155
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,777
you cannot return
to this house

1156
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:48,873
because it will no longer be your home!

1157
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:54,547
Once you leave, I will
no longer be your wife!

1158
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,682
Mama!

1159
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,288
Say goodbye to your father, children.

1160
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,491
Forever.

1161
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:07,228
Please, Papa,
don't leave.

1162
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:19,845
Get out there. Leave,
if that's what you want.

1163
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,543
Robert, I'm still
your father.

1164
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:26,109
No, you're not
my father anymore.

1165
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:30,258
Robert.

1166
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:50,901
Goodbye, my
little chickens.

1167
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:14,434
I only have
one life!

1168
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,753
<i>Nietzsche is right.</i>

1169
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:17,787
<i>My freedom has been here
all along for the taking.</i>

1170
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:20,835
<i>Now is my last chance.</i>

1171
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:24,998
<i>This is my one
and only life.</i>

1172
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:27,473
<i>I'm looking for
Bertha Pappenheim.</i>

1173
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,567
She's in the garden
with the doctor.

1174
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,806
Should I inform her
you are here?

1175
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:34,279
No, thank you,
I shall wait.

1176
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:36,317
Please, wait for
her upstairs.

1177
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:37,749
Thank you.

1178
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:37,740
I love you.

1179
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:45,111
You will always be the
only man in my life.

1180
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,192
Josef!
How are you?

1181
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,718
<i>Papa, don't leave.</i>

1182
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,420
<i>Having doubts, Josef?</i>

1183
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:30,487
How could I have given up everything?

1184
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,159
You'd given up everything
long before you met me.

1185
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,896
Yes, but now
I have nothing!

1186
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,733
<i>And nothing
is everything.</i>

1187
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:40,570
<i>I n order to grow strong, you must first</i>

1188
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:43,668
<i>sink your roots deep
into nothingness.</i>

1189
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:48,341
<i>But learn to face your
Ioneliest Ioneliness.</i>

1190
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:51,385
My wife.

1191
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:52,579
My children.

1192
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:55,054
<i>How could I
have left them?</i>

1193
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:58,991
<i>You must be ready to burn
yourself in your own flame.</i>

1194
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,153
<i>How could you
become new,</i>

1195
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:04,926
<i>if you would not
first become ashes?</i>

1196
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:26,113
Waiter.

1197
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,750
Josef?

1198
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:32,683
Dr. Breuer?

1199
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:36,782
Josef!

1200
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:39,621
Where are
you going?!

1201
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,753
What a ridiculous man.

1202
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:44,821
<i>Josef, come backl</i>

1203
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:59,078
<i>Josefl</i>

1204
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:05,818
<i>Josefl
Look out I</i>

1205
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:13,250
<i>Josefl</i>

1206
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:15,296
<i>Josefl
Come backl</i>

1207
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:20,100
Josef!

1208
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:22,436
Josef!

1209
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:38,318
<i>Josef, listen
to me.</i>

1210
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,582
<i>Eight,</i>

1211
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:43,089
<i>seven,</i>

1212
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:44,522
<i>six,</i>

1213
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:45,786
<i>five,</i>

1214
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,191
<i>four,</i>

1215
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,695
<i>three,</i>

1216
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:52,498
<i>one.</i>

1217
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:55,529
You're wide
awake now.

1218
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,696
Where am I?

1219
01:27:57,772 --> 01:27:58,796
Where am I?

1220
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:01,307
Everything's alright,
Josef.

1221
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:04,368
Siggy...

1222
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:07,380
what's happening
to me?

1223
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:10,417
You are in
your house.

1224
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:12,783
It'll all come
back to you.

1225
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:15,084
I did exactly
as you instructed.

1226
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:17,852
I hypnotized you using
your watch as a pendulum.

1227
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:21,986
Here it is, Josef,
on your desk.

1228
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:34,034
Yes.
Yes.

1229
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:43,383
Yes, I remember.

1230
01:28:43,451 --> 01:28:45,078
How long
was I under?

1231
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,643
Nearly an hour.

1232
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:52,559
<i>You wept,
you looked frightened.</i>

1233
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,356
<i>I asked you if you wanted to stop.</i>

1234
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:03,795
Now I know what it would be like...

1235
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:06,396
to live differently.

1236
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:14,605
Max and Rachel have arrived for dinner.

1237
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,717
Mathilde.

1238
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:22,682
You complain you don't see enough of me.

1239
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:24,952
Yet, when
I'm here,

1240
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,891
you want
to desert me?

1241
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:39,469
I've been
away, my dear.

1242
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,302
But now
I am back.

1243
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:46,673
I'm glad
you're here.

1244
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:52,075
Dr. Freud, my husband needs a doctor.

1245
01:29:58,359 --> 01:29:59,724
To your health,
my boy.

1246
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:01,386
And to you, Max.

1247
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:03,726
And to you, Josef.

1248
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:06,858
Oheers.

1249
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:19,277
Oh!

1250
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:25,151
M mm.

1251
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,744
My boy, my boy.

1252
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:36,721
Excuse me.

1253
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:11,322
Have I made
you cry?

1254
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:15,392
It's a good cry.
It's sad too.

1255
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:19,236
When I think
how long it's been-

1256
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:22,902
Marry me, Mathilde.
Please.

1257
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:27,141
I think we did this
15 years ago.

1258
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:30,514
And I choose
to do it again.

1259
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:33,179
Today.

1260
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:36,951
And every day for the rest of our lives.

1261
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:47,325
So, tell me,
how did you cast her out?

1262
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:51,235
Well, I was terrified
by aging and death.

1263
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:53,364
I fought back
but blindly.

1264
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:56,274
<i>I n desperation,
I attacked my wife</i>

1265
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,403
and sought rescue
in the arms of one

1266
01:31:58,479 --> 01:31:59,912
<i>who had no rescue to givel</i>

1267
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:05,312
<i>I n a certain sense,
I've betrayed you.</i>

1268
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:08,514
I have been so dishonest with you.

1269
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:11,285
Oompletely.

1270
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,419
I was myself involved with a woman.

1271
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:18,158
A few months ago.

1272
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:19,358
Her name
was Lou.

1273
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:22,368
<i>Not so unlike
your Bertha.</i>

1274
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,461
Beautiful girl.

1275
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:30,099
I fell in love.

1276
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:34,238
She just appeared
to be my twin brain.

1277
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:36,510
<i>My soul's mate.</i>

1278
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:39,579
<i>And she led me
on to believe</i>

1279
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:42,748
<i>that I was the man to whom
she was destined and...</i>

1280
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:45,787
<i>I believed her.</i>

1281
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:48,920
<i>And when I offered
myself to her,</i>

1282
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:51,829
she spurned me...

1283
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:56,199
<i>in favor of
my best friend...</i>

1284
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:57,828
<i>in the world.</i>

1285
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:03,935
I must tell you that there is not...

1286
01:33:04,011 --> 01:33:08,675
not one day
that goes by...

1287
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,148
not even an hour,

1288
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:15,548
<i>where I do not think of that woman.</i>

1289
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:18,316
She is your Bertha.

1290
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:21,190
But you see? You've been
doing double work here.

1291
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:23,230
Yours and mine.

1292
01:33:23,297 --> 01:33:25,629
I'm like the most
cowardly of women.

1293
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,032
And I crouch behind
your back here,

1294
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:32,698
<i>letting you face all
the dangers all alone.</i>

1295
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:35,435
You have courage.

1296
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:39,946
Friedrich, there is
something I must tell you.

1297
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:40,878
Dr. Breuer?

1298
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:42,381
How do you do?

1299
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:45,283
You must read these letters
N ietzsche has sent me.

1300
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:47,844
These are
my private letters.

1301
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,150
You did see
her then?

1302
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:50,781
Yes, but I
refused her.

1303
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:52,553
So all of this was just a pretense.

1304
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,095
I made a promise
to help you.

1305
01:33:55,162 --> 01:33:56,686
I never betrayed
that promise.

1306
01:33:56,764 --> 01:33:58,823
What did she do? She
took you by the arm?

1307
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:03,732
<i>Told you she had to
spend more time with you?</i>

1308
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:11,540
<i>I shared one, one holy moment with her,</i>

1309
01:34:11,612 --> 01:34:13,978
<i>it's the only holy
moment I've ever known.</i>

1310
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:17,040
<i>No one fell in love with me, ever. Ever.</i>

1311
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:22,647
Friedrich, it may have
been a holy moment for you,

1312
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:24,213
but not for her.

1313
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:26,920
What are
you saying?

1314
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:29,724
<i>She never mentioned
the water?</i>

1315
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:32,259
No.

1316
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:43,306
I feel such
a loss.

1317
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:44,776
H m.

1318
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:58,083
I don't know.

1319
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,559
I think I've
lost Lou.

1320
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,997
And you.

1321
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:09,935
Everything, I lose.

1322
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:12,871
<i>I could have
From your mind.</i>

1323
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,305
And you
have a family.

1324
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:18,277
You have your family
and I have my pretenses.

1325
01:35:18,345 --> 01:35:22,406
My secret little ways of
tolerating my aloneness.

1326
01:35:22,483 --> 01:35:24,280
But I glorify it,
don't I?

1327
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:30,681
And I just don't
want to die alone.

1328
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:33,352
I don't want my body
just to be discovered.

1329
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:36,389
By its stench.

1330
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:44,437
Lou softened that fear
for me for a while.

1331
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:49,442
But you're right.

1332
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:51,478
It's just
an illusion.

1333
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:52,307
Friedrich.

1334
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:57,043
It's such
an illusion.

1335
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:00,246
<i>Friedrich. She does care about you.</i>

1336
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,354
She went to extremes to help you.

1337
01:36:08,662 --> 01:36:11,358
<i>If your tears
had a voice,</i>

1338
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:13,297
what would they say?

1339
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:17,126
I feel so ashamed.

1340
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:18,831
Tell me.

1341
01:36:20,975 --> 01:36:22,840
My tears would say we're free.

1342
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,810
<i>You never
let us out,</i>

1343
01:36:24,879 --> 01:36:28,178
until Dr. Breuer
opened the gate.

1344
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:37,690
And what about the
sadness behind those tears?

1345
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:42,695
It's not sadness.
It's such a relief.

1346
01:36:42,763 --> 01:36:44,594
It's such
a relief!

1347
01:36:47,368 --> 01:36:50,201
It's the first time I'm
revealing my loneliness.

1348
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:53,468
It's melting.
It's melting away.

1349
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:58,672
<i>It's a paradox. Isolation
exists only in isolation.</i>

1350
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:03,175
Once shared,
it evaporates.

1351
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:05,343
My dear friend.

1352
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:17,360
We are friends.

1353
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:18,989
I like saying that.

1354
01:37:23,537 --> 01:37:25,698
No one ever said
this to me.

1355
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:34,237
I like it.

1356
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:38,543
I like it.

1357
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:41,053
We are friends.

1358
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:44,346
Friedrich.

1359
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:45,517
It's good.

1360
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:47,527
Stay with us tonight.

1361
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:50,223
Have supper with me and my family.

1362
01:37:50,297 --> 01:37:54,927
No, it would mean to abandon my mission.

1363
01:37:55,002 --> 01:37:57,061
It's time we went our ways.

1364
01:38:12,753 --> 01:38:16,883
<i>"We'll have friends, and have
become strangers to each other.</i>

1365
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:18,982
"This is as
it ought to be.

1366
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:21,721
"We do not want either to
conceal or obscure the fact

1367
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:24,662
"as if we had to be ashamed of it.

1368
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:29,897
We are two ships, each of which
has its goal and its course."

1369
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:32,996
And finally, Dr. Breuer,

1370
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:36,042
"We have to become
strangers to one another

1371
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:39,409
because it's the law to
which we are subject."

1372
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,449
Have a safe journey.

1373
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:43,847
My dear friend.
