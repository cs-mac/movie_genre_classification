2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,294
Christ is risen from the dead,
trampling down death by death.

3
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:27,807
And upon those in the tomb.

4
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:31,366
Bestowing life.

5
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,916
When I will come to see you.

6
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:57,157
Rapid flow the dear rivers

7
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,691
I want you to carry away
all my sorrow.

8
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:08,207
With your fast waters.

9
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:11,274
On the fields
the girls were strolling.

10
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:16,111
Singing and picking up
corn flowers.

11
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:18,617
There they met the young fellow.

12
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,210
He gave them a look
as though he were superior.

13
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:25,054
Scarcely looked at them.

14
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:28,455
Scarcely looked at them.

15
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,493
Katusha!

16
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,360
Katusha!

17
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,405
What are you doing
in the fields again?

18
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:46,343
There was nothing more
to do in the house,

19
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,176
so I came here to help!

20
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:52,275
You'll catch it when they
find out you're in the fields again!

21
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:55,719
And what are you thinking of?
Don't you know he's arriving today?

22
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:58,349
He? Who?

23
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,087
Who? You numbskull!

24
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:03,789
The prince! Dmitri Ivanovitch!

25
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:06,264
He's on his way
from the station now!

26
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:12,164
I thought it was tomorrow!

27
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,072
Tomorrow! Go into the house
and put on your Sunday frock!

28
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:17,507
You dirty girl!
And comb your hair!

29
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:18,601
I will!

30
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,703
And don't forget
his welcoming gift!

31
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,111
Have you?

32
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:34,188
What are you smelling, Dmitri?
I don't smell anything.

33
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:37,355
Spring. You don't smell the spring?

34
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,624
Oh, that!

35
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:41,258
This air. It's wonderful.

36
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:42,678
It's going to be
a wonderful summer.

37
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:45,227
But there'll be
no loafing for you, Dmitri.

38
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:46,966
You'll spend the summer in study.

39
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,373
We shall be very disappointed if you
fail to pass your officer's examination.

40
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,934
Aunt Marie,
I don't like the army.

41
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,004
- What?
- I don't like what it represents.

42
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:57,481
I don't see why I should be
an officer, anyway.

43
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:00,213
Because your father was one,
and your grandfather!

44
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:03,120
Because the Nekhlyudovs
have always served their czar.

45
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,419
I don't know whether
I want to serve my czar.

46
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:06,857
- Dmitri, dear boy!
- What is this?

47
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,224
I want to serve my country.

48
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,320
That's why I'd rather go
into civil service.

49
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,228
Russia's in a pretty rotten condition.

50
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,299
- Dmitri!
- Dmitri!

51
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:15,630
We're going to have
a revolution if we don't look out.

52
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:17,897
Revolution in Russia? Ridiculous.

53
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,495
You think so?
Well, let me tell you.

54
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,337
When our rulers place yokes
around our necks...

55
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,401
When tyrants
grind their heels in our faces...

56
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:27,810
When oppression rules
instead of justice...

57
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,679
Where did you
pick up this nonsense?

58
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,141
I read it in a book.

59
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,257
Good morning. Good morning.

60
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,735
The prince must be
a big man now!

61
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,704
Oh, yes. Don't move all around.

62
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,171
Stand in one place.

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,003
Over this way.

64
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:59,071
- Ivan, you stand there.
- Yes, Anton Ivanovitch.

65
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:02,376
Here, you stand in line.
You get over there.

66
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:27,497
Welcome, Your Highness,
Dmitri Ivanovitch!

67
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,411
Come around.

68
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,079
Everyone, just as I told you.

69
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:43,588
Now one at a time.

70
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:44,749
Ivan.

71
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:53,757
- Welcome, Your Highness.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

72
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,860
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

73
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:58,961
Thank you.

74
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,473
- May God bless Your Highness.
- Oh, thank you.

75
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,874
Thank you very much. Thank you.

76
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,208
Why do they give me food?
They need it, and we don't.

77
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,591
Hush! It's a custom...
It's always done!

78
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,947
Thank you very much.
But really, I don't like taking it.

79
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,485
Anton, His Highness
is tired after his journey.

80
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:14,997
Tell them to place
their gifts on the steps

81
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,381
and give them
His Highness' thanks.

82
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:19,449
But, Aunt Marie, I'm not tired,
and I should thank them personally.

83
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,187
Friends!

84
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,563
Dear friends!
And brothers in suffering!

85
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:25,928
That'll do, Dmitri. Come.

86
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:28,524
- Tell them, Anton.
- But, Aunt Marie...

87
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:38,371
Brothers in suffering, indeed!

88
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:39,673
Really, Dmitri!

89
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,082
Welcome, Dmitri Ivanovitch.

90
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,779
I wish you every happiness...

91
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,981
and... and happiness!

92
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:52,047
And I give you this for good luck!

93
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,023
Katusha?

94
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:58,496
No! Oh, my goodness, it is.

95
00:06:58,565 --> 00:06:59,896
Why, of all the...

96
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:01,844
This is the most
startling thing I've ever seen!

97
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,068
I mean the way you've changed!

98
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,264
Why, six years ago...
I can't believe my eyes...

99
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,499
You were just a little girl
with freckles, wasn't she?

100
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:09,132
She has grown up.

101
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:11,200
You were just
a little freckled cocoon.

102
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:13,837
And now,
now you are a butterfly!

103
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:16,279
A beautiful
white and golden butterfly!

104
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,510
If our butterfly could manage it,

105
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:21,452
I wish she would serve us tea
in the sitting room.

106
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:23,885
You'll want to wash first, Dmitri.

107
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:25,925
You'll find your old room
upstairs ready for you.

108
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:27,960
I can't get over it!
She's become a raving beauty!

109
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:29,289
She's a very sweet girl.

110
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:31,227
She's a servant.
You're not forgetting that.

111
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:33,843
- What difference does that make?
- She's not to be treated as an equal.

112
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,698
Why not?
We practically grew up together.

113
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,168
Well, now, you are grown up.

114
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,432
You're not of the same class
and never can be.

115
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,872
Even though your Aunt Sophie
is teaching her French

116
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,340
and trying to make a lady of her.

117
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,240
Why, Marie,
I'm doing nothing of the kind.

118
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,471
I'm very fond of the child,

119
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:48,124
and she has
a natural aptitude for learning.

120
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,658
You will never make
a peasant into a lady.

121
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:50,876
I'm not so sure of that.

122
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,195
After all, what's the difference
between peasants and ourselves?

123
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,948
Suppose we all took our clothes off...

124
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:56,511
What?

125
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,589
Well, I don't mean
that we really should...

126
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,992
What I mean is,
figuratively speaking.

127
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,154
If...

128
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,030
Is there warm water in my room?

129
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,362
Yes.

130
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:22,437
Katusha!

131
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,450
- Where are you?
- With the cow!

132
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,584
What a book!

133
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,787
What marvelous thoughts
this writer has!

134
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,387
- You've got to read it.
- What is it called?

135
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:39,658
Look.

136
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:43,293
<i>"Land and Freedom. "</i>

137
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:44,734
The government
has suppressed it.

138
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:47,432
I've met Simonson, the author.
He's a great thinker.

139
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:49,065
The police are after him.

140
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:50,734
Is it an immoral book?

141
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,437
It's the most moral book
ever written.

142
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,104
It says that all people are equal

143
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,791
and that the land
should belong to everybody.

144
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:57,593
- Is there a love story?
- No, no, of course not.

145
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,676
- Love stories are for children.
- I like them.

146
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,380
They're all right in their place,
but before love comes humanity.

147
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:03,615
People.

148
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,453
But if people didn't fall in love,

149
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,652
there wouldn't be any people.

150
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:12,221
Well, yes, but... but you do believe,
of course, that we're all equal?

151
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:15,131
- Are we?
- Not yet, but we should be.

152
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:19,061
Then who would be servant
and who would be master?

153
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:21,572
There wouldn't be any servants.
We'd all be masters.

154
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:22,938
Who would do the work then?

155
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,340
Oh, you numbskull.

156
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,174
Katusha, you're only beautiful.
You're not bright.

157
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:28,908
Now look here. Stop that!

158
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,849
Who does the air belong to?

159
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:34,847
I don't know.

160
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,855
Do you have to pay
to breathe air?

161
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,220
No.

162
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,758
Now we are getting somewhere.

163
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:41,657
And the water,
who owns the water?

164
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:44,595
- What kind of water?
- There's only one kind of water!

165
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:45,858
Who owns it?

166
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,400
The man who owns the well?

167
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:52,234
No, no... the water in the ocean.
Salt water, let's say.

168
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:55,069
What is it good for,
except pickles?

169
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,733
You're hopeless.

170
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,300
But I'll make you
understand this if I have to...

171
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,472
Get up.

172
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:03,105
Come here.

173
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:09,811
Now kiss me.

174
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,686
Come on, I'm ordering you to.

175
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:13,191
Kiss me.

176
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,622
There! Now do you see
what I mean?

177
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:18,789
No.

178
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:21,595
- Why did you kiss me?
- Because you asked me to.

179
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:24,034
- Why did I ask you to?
- I don't know.

180
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:25,161
Well, I'll tell you why.

181
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:28,139
Because being a nobleman, I knew
that if I asked you to do something,

182
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:29,231
you'd have to do it.

183
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:31,675
Now why have I the right
to force you against your will?

184
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:32,904
Why should...

185
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:36,972
- Well, you didn't exactly force me.
- Keep quiet when I'm talking.

186
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,711
Who is it
that gives me that privilege?

187
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,583
God? No, no, no...
the accident of birth.

188
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:43,121
Why should that be the...

189
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:46,391
What's the matter?

190
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:50,361
First, you ask me to kiss you,
and then when I do what you ask,

191
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,829
you shout at me.

192
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:54,628
No, no, Katusha, don't cry.
Don't cry. I was only arguing.

193
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,712
I was just trying to show you
how unequal things are.

194
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,966
It was just
a philosophical discussion.

195
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:01,131
But you asked me to...

196
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:03,167
I know, but I was
just trying to put over a point.

197
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,370
That's all. I didn't have
any desire to kiss you.

198
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:08,642
No, no, nothing like that.
It was all pure reasoning.

199
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:11,775
I was just illustrating
an unjust social condition.

200
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,411
There, there. That's all it was.

201
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:15,977
Don't cry, Katusha.

202
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,390
They've been together
all the summer,

203
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:22,985
every opportunity they could get.

204
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,825
I don't think
there's any harm in it, Marie.

205
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:27,417
Every time I've seen them together,
they've been reading a book.

206
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:30,800
A book can always be put aside.
I'm glad he's leaving today.

207
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:43,313
Where are you going with it?
Oh, be reasonable, Katusha.

208
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:44,782
I can't let you have my hat.

209
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,445
The school will have my hide
if I came back without it.

210
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,681
It's part of my uniform.

211
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:55,183
- Come and get it!
- Please, Katusha! Please!

212
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,068
Here.

213
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:14,437
Now when you are gone,

214
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,379
I'll have nothing
to remember you by.

215
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,350
If I don't leave you something,
you'll forget me?

216
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:22,978
No, Dmitri Ivanovitch.

217
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,083
I'll never forget you.

218
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:31,923
It's been
a marvelous summer, hasn't it?

219
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,793
Next summer, when I come back,

220
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,425
that'll be a marvelous one, too.

221
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:38,697
Every summer after that.

222
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,639
Ten months
before I'll see you again.

223
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:46,769
- It's going to be hard to wait.
- For me, too.

224
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:49,872
Well, then, let's think
only of four years from now.

225
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:54,181
After I quit the army,
then we can be together all the time.

226
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,485
There.

227
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:03,621
You can remember me,
at least until these fade.

228
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:06,631
And forever after.

229
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:12,628
Where did you get violets
as late as this?

230
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:15,139
In the conservatory.

231
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,200
If your aunts
knew I took them...

232
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:23,477
They'd be angry, wouldn't they?

233
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:24,777
Yes.

234
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,749
They would be angry.

235
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:38,897
You will try and pass your
examinations, Dmitri, dear, won't you?

236
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:39,965
I will, Aunt Sophie.

237
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:41,443
You'll like army life.
Men always do.

238
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,128
Thank you, Aunt Marie.
It's been lovely.

239
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:44,847
You be a good boy,
and don't drink too much.

240
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,395
Yes, Aunt Sophie, I will.

241
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:47,549
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye.

242
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:48,972
Good-bye. Good-bye.

243
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,737
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

244
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:53,779
Good-bye!

245
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:57,942
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye, dear. Good-bye!

246
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:11,293
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, relax.

247
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:12,854
I haven't come here officially.

248
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:16,163
I'm here because you've been making
a great fool of yourself, Lieutenant.

249
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:19,602
You were very rude
to General Davidoff's wife last night.

250
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:21,503
- Rude? I, sir?
- That's what I said!

251
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,633
She showed
every evidence of liking you.

252
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,802
And you avoided her
as though she had the cholera.

253
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:28,108
She's a married woman, sir.
She's the general's wife.

254
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:30,911
That's precisely it, young man!
She's the general's wife!

255
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:32,177
She can be useful.

256
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,378
She's helped a lot of
young men toward promotion.

257
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,479
Do you want to stay
a lieutenant all your army life?

258
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:38,785
- No, sir.
- Then confound it!

259
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,587
Do the things
that are done in the army!

260
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,686
Mix! Go to parties!
Learn to hold your liquor!

261
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:46,857
These are also the attributes
of a good soldier!

262
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,298
Get yourself liked.

263
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,301
You read too much!

264
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:52,166
Keep your nose out of books,

265
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:55,071
except those pertaining
to army regulations.

266
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:59,602
<i>What's this? Land and Freedom?</i>

267
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,880
I'm disgusted with you!

268
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:04,644
Continue the way
you've been going, Dmitri,

269
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,982
and you'll end up by being
cashiered out of the service!

270
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:12,146
Oh!

271
00:15:55,167 --> 00:16:01,504
To fall asleep.

272
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:05,772
Forget myself forever.

273
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:13,513
And leave everything painlessly.

274
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:19,354
My life was a joke.

275
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:27,425
Crafty and evil.

276
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:34,198
I don't care if I will.

277
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:39,768
Part with life.

278
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:46,045
Silence, grief.

279
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:49,281
Silence.

280
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:54,952
Don't touch my old wound.

281
00:16:55,027 --> 00:17:01,728
The tale of dear love.

282
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:09,801
Never will return.

283
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:20,578
Never.

284
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,818
My felt boots are very old.

285
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:07,491
And without soles.

286
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:11,764
When I put on my best shirt

287
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:17,173
I will look very good.

288
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:23,705
My white face
is blooming like a rose.

289
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:31,280
My white face
is blooming like a rose.

290
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:34,258
But better not to go too far.

291
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:37,625
And not to wear
all the rings and bracelets.

292
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:42,199
And not to wear
all the rings and bracelets.

293
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:44,259
Don't wear your presents.

294
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,930
Better have
your show boots fixed.

295
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:51,599
Better have
your show boots fixed.

296
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:54,109
Get out!

297
00:18:57,183 --> 00:19:00,243
Discipline's good for them.
That's what they need.

298
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:04,652
But better not to go too far.

299
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:14,696
Don't wear your presents,
Better have your show boots fixed.

300
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,733
Better have your show boots fixed.

301
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:24,565
Better have your show boots fixed.

302
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:46,031
If we wait for him any longer,
we shall miss the services.

303
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:49,033
But his letter definitely said
he'd be here tonight.

304
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:03,377
- Dmitri!
- Hello! Hello! Hello!

305
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:06,179
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was delayed.

306
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:09,688
- I'm in time for church, I hope.
- We can just manage it.

307
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:10,966
May I present
Lieutenant Schonbock?

308
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,550
- My aunts.
- Your Highness.

309
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:14,986
You are coming with us,
Lieutenant?

310
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,187
Thank you, Your Highness.

311
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:17,729
I just came in
to pay my respects.

312
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:21,163
I am scheduled to do my worshipping
a few miles away from here.

313
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,133
I'll drop in for you
tomorrow morning then.

314
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:24,965
- You're not leaving tomorrow?
- Yes, I must.

315
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:26,971
The army is off
to the border for maneuvers.

316
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,030
Remember, I'm in
His Majesty's service now.

317
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,099
Well, I must be off.

318
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,576
- Happy Easter to you.
- Happy Easter.

319
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,307
- Happy Easter to you.
- Thank you.

320
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:37,281
- Good-bye.
- Good luck.

321
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,647
I'll see you in the morning.

322
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:45,179
Dmitri, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

323
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:47,418
Two years,
and you haven't been here,

324
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,051
you haven't written... nothing.

325
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:52,097
Darling, if you only knew
how they keep my nose to my work.

326
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:53,597
It's a constant grind.

327
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,066
Anyhow, I'm here now,
and it's Easter Eve,

328
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:58,797
and it's a sin
to scold anyone tonight.

329
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:00,711
You're both as beautiful
as you've always been.

330
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:04,709
- And so is Matrona Pavlovna!
- Your Highness.

331
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:06,506
Katusha.

332
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:09,548
Look at her!
An angel in a white dress!

333
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:10,707
She made it herself!

334
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,412
No! I dare say the heavenly angels
themselves aren't that talented!

335
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:17,284
Come now,
we really must be going.

336
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:19,187
Yes. May I?

337
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,931
Tell me, has Katusha
been behaving herself?

338
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,297
She always does.

339
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:31,393
We're seriously thinking
of adopting her.

340
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,062
Oh, she's not married yet?

341
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:35,333
No, she's had several good offers.

342
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,897
But she doesn't seem interested.

343
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,876
Strange.

344
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:43,304
Enable us.

345
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:51,382
To glorify Thee.

346
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:59,486
With a pure heart.

347
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:03,264
Glory to the Holy,
Consubstantial, Life-giving.

348
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:05,428
And undivided Trinity.

349
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:11,204
Now and ever,
and unto ages of ages.

350
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:19,276
Amen

351
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:28,819
Christ is risen from the dead.

352
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:35,557
Trampling down death by death.

353
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:43,634
And upon those in the tomb
bestowing life

354
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:51,738
Christ is risen from the dead.

355
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:56,584
Trampling down death by death.

356
00:22:56,655 --> 00:23:04,084
And upon those in the tomb
bestowing life

357
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:11,934
Christ is risen from the dead.

358
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:16,566
Trampling down death by death.

359
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:23,343
And upon those in the tomb
bestowing life

360
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:29,877
Christ is risen from the dead.

361
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:33,789
Trampling down death by death.

362
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:39,855
And upon those in the tomb
bestowing life.

363
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:44,562
In peace let us pray to the Lord.

364
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:51,804
Lord, have mercy.

365
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:54,971
Peace in Heaven
and salvation for our souls.

366
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:58,312
Let us pray to the Lord.

367
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:06,383
Lord, have mercy.

368
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:13,859
The day of Resurrection!

369
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:17,595
Let us be illumined,
O ye people!

370
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:20,502
The Passover,
the Passover of the Lord!

371
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:23,939
From death unto life.

372
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:27,103
And from Earth unto Heaven.

373
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:32,640
Hath Christ our God
brought us over.

374
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:39,453
From death unto life

375
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:43,621
Christ is risen from the dead,
trampling down death by death.

376
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:49,292
And upon those in the tomb
bestowing life

377
00:24:49,368 --> 00:24:53,134
Christ is risen from the dead,
trampling down death by death.

378
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:58,643
And upon those in the tomb
bestowing life

379
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,510
Christ is risen from the dead,
trampling down death by death.

380
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:08,076
And upon those in the tomb
bestowing life.

381
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:12,817
- Christ is risen, Katusha.
- He is indeed, Matrona Pavlovna.

382
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,423
- Christ is risen.
- He is indeed.

383
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:25,735
- Christ is risen, Katusha.
- He is indeed, Dmitri Ivanovitch.

384
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:32,937
- Dmitri, Christ is risen.
- He is indeed, Aunt Marie.

385
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,004
- Christ is risen.
- Christ is risen.

386
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,447
- He is indeed.
- He is indeed.

387
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:42,250
- Christ is risen.
- Christ is risen, Katusha.

388
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:45,119
- He is indeed.
- He is indeed.

389
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:51,789
The Passover and the Atonement.

390
00:25:51,864 --> 00:25:54,526
The Passover of all August-Christ...

391
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:59,099
The horse ran away
in a cloud of dust!

392
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:03,472
Well, it's bedtime.

393
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:12,307
Well, Aunt Marie, we never have
suppers like this in the army.

394
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:14,147
But you like
army life now, don't you?

395
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:16,210
- Oh, yes.
- I thought you would.

396
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:19,052
I knew it would knock
some of those ideas out of your head.

397
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:20,148
One grows older...

398
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:22,216
Your room is ready
as always, Dmitri.

399
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:23,294
Thank you, Aunt Sophie.

400
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:24,806
- Good night, dear.
- Pleasant dreams to you.

401
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,374
- Good night, Aunt Marie.
- Good night, my dear.

402
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:27,642
We'll all breakfast with you
in the morning.

403
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:28,690
Yes.

404
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:32,225
- Good night.
- Good night, Dmitri Ivanovitch.

405
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,776
- Good night.
- Good night.

406
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:09,539
But if he leaves in the morning,
I won't be able to see him at all.

407
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:10,870
You'll see him at breakfast.

408
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:13,537
Besides, you saw enough of him
at church and at supper,

409
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:15,637
the way you kept staring at him.

410
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:18,911
I looked at him because
I haven't seen him for two years.

411
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:22,552
Oh, I'm tired.

412
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:23,952
Good night, child.

413
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,049
Good night, Matrona Pavlovna.

414
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,568
He's handsomer than ever.

415
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:45,235
I do believe the army
brings out a man's good looks.

416
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,335
It certainly gives him dash.

417
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:49,642
- Good night, Marie.
- Good night, Sophie.

418
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,898
Dmitri Ivanovitch.

419
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:56,229
Katusha.

420
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:02,697
Are you glad to see me?

421
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:06,642
Oh, Dmitri Ivanovitch!

422
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:09,737
Dmitri Ivanovitch.

423
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:15,109
Have you forgotten me?

424
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,351
- You have.
- No.

425
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:22,689
I was afraid I wasn't
going to see you alone.

426
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:24,126
So was I.

427
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:25,959
<i>Katusha!</i>

428
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:27,965
We can't talk here.

429
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,160
Why don't you...
It's a beautiful night.

430
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:31,793
We can walk a little and talk.

431
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,862
Oh, I couldn't. It's so late.

432
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,135
We may not see each other
again for a long time.

433
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:38,335
Come, Katusha.

434
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:43,113
No, Dmitri Ivanovitch.

435
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:45,081
We'll talk here, like this.

436
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,711
<i>Katusha? What is that noise?</i>

437
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:53,247
You see? Please, Katusha,
just for a moment.

438
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,870
Do you remember our tree?

439
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:14,969
- Of course I do.
- Shall we go there?

440
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:18,140
No, it's too cold.

441
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:19,843
It's clouding up.

442
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:22,346
I know.

443
00:32:57,956 --> 00:33:01,756
- Remember?
- Violets?

444
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:06,289
Oh, yes, violets.

445
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:12,134
No, Dmitri Ivanovitch, no.
We shouldn't do this.

446
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,671
Why not? When two people
love each other...

447
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:15,797
Love.

448
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:18,934
Remember when you said that
every summer we would be together?

449
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,637
Now two summers have passed.

450
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:22,202
Is everyone going to
scold me tonight?

451
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,425
Very well, then. I should have
come back or I should have written.

452
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:25,677
I didn't.

453
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,962
Now tell me because of that
you don't love me any longer,

454
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:29,317
and I'll go away.

455
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:32,356
No, Dmitri Ivanovitch, please, no.

456
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:34,585
Katusha, army maneuvers
aren't child's play.

457
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,889
I may be hurt,
perhaps even killed.

458
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:41,991
It's you who have changed, not I.

459
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:46,470
I'm just as I was... every bit as much
in love with you as before I left.

460
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,938
It's you who have forgotten me.

461
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:50,599
Don't say that.

462
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:03,739
Why, Dmitri Ivanovitch.

463
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:06,113
Matrona Pavlovna...

464
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:09,347
tell my aunts I had forgotten
I had to leave so early.

465
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:11,446
I shan't be able to
breakfast with them.

466
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:15,390
Tell them I hope, however, to see them
when I return from the maneuvers.

467
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,328
Oh... please give this to Katusha.

468
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:21,325
Good-bye.

469
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,165
Good-bye, Your Highness.

470
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:54,621
Katusha. Katusha, wake up.

471
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:59,032
It's for you.
From Dmitri Ivanovitch.

472
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:01,264
Dmitri Iv...

473
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:04,368
- Is he gone?
- Yes.

474
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:07,070
He said he had to hurry off.

475
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,897
Oh, no.

476
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,734
No, no, no!

477
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:46,983
Why, Dmitri, I thought
I was coming to fetch you.

478
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:49,281
- Well, here I am.
- Oh, I see.

479
00:36:49,354 --> 00:36:51,618
Well, I shall say
that's the best way to end it.

480
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:52,713
End what?

481
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,217
Why is it the best way?

482
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:57,454
Because it always
has been, my boy.

483
00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:01,158
Kiss, and ride away.
That's the best way.

484
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:32,386
Katusha! Katusha! Where are you?

485
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:34,988
Look, he has hurt his leg,
and his mother is dead.

486
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:36,897
If I don't take care of him,
he will die.

487
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:38,128
The princesses are coming!

488
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:41,000
I think they know.
What are you going to do?

489
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:42,630
What can I do?

490
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:47,338
I'll talk to Dmitri Ivanovitch tomorrow.
He'll help me, won't he?

491
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:49,312
Oh, I hope he comes tomorrow.

492
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,575
It isn't absolutely
sure yet, you know.

493
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,987
- We wish to speak to Katusha alone.
- Yes, Your Highness.

494
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:02,117
Stand up.

495
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,352
It pains me
to speak of this, Katusha.

496
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,523
I have hoped against hope
that I was mistaken,

497
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,591
but now your condition
has become obvious.

498
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:13,398
- Yes, Your Highness.
- We had such hopes for you, too.

499
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:15,549
Well, when a girl gets herself
into trouble of this kind,

500
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:16,870
she must take the consequences.

501
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:19,501
Of course, we cannot
keep you here any longer.

502
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,636
Anton will give you
three months' wages,

503
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,578
and it would be better
if you left immediately.

504
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:25,639
- Oh, Marie, immediately?
- It is best.

505
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:27,742
That is all, Katusha.

506
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:45,691
Has it occurred to you
that it might have been Dmitri?

507
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,102
Dmitri is our own flesh and blood.

508
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,833
We must protect him at all costs.

509
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:52,637
Supposing he were to come back here
and find out about her?

510
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,975
He says he's changed,
but how can one tell?

511
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:58,777
You wouldn't like him
to marry her, would you?

512
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,081
Oh, what nonsense
you're making me talk, Sophie.

513
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:04,678
Of course Dmitri
had nothing to do with it.

514
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:10,789
- Well?
- They said I must go.

515
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:12,227
Today. Now.

516
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:14,196
I have just seen Anton.

517
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:16,529
Dmitri Ivanovitch isn't coming.

518
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:18,466
The orders have been changed.

519
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:20,163
The army goes through by train,

520
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:22,138
and that stops here
only for a moment.

521
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:24,674
But I must see him! Oh, I must!

522
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:27,802
When he knows about it, he'll...
Oh, Matrona Pavlovna...

523
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:30,211
I know he'll help me!
He'll help me!

524
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,714
He'll help me!

525
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:59,436
In the forge,
the young blacksmiths.

526
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,204
In the forge,
the young blacksmiths.

527
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,714
They are forging,
they are forging.

528
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:07,216
They are forging and telling.

529
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:12,279
Calling, calling, Dunia
calling, calling, Dunia.

530
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:16,952
Calling - conjuring,
calling - conjuring.

531
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:22,125
Let's go, let's go, Dunia,
let's go, let's go, Dunia.

532
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,967
Let's go, Dunia, to the woods,
let's go, Dunia, to the woods.

533
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:31,975
Let's go, let's go, Dunia,
let's go, let's go, Dunia.

534
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,204
Let's go, Dunia, to the woods...

535
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:35,802
Dmitri Ivanovitch!

536
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:40,415
- Got you that time!
- You're the devil's own luck!

537
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:42,146
Dmitri Ivanovitch!

538
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,484
The nightingale is a small bird.

539
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:47,820
The small canary
is singing very plaintively.

540
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:51,658
One, two, sorrow, we don't care.

541
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:13,873
You could always stay here,

542
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:16,385
but you know
what the village has been like.

543
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:19,582
Still, it may not be so bad in Moscow.

544
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:22,353
You may be happy there.

545
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:38,931
It's a pity we have to put him there
without holy words.

546
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,671
But what can we do?

547
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:43,236
You wouldn't tell them
who the father was,

548
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,339
so they wouldn't baptize him.

549
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,614
- Why did we stop dancing?
- I want to be alone with you...

550
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:53,980
if that isn't too bold
in a prospective husband.

551
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:55,518
Besides, I'm thirsty.

552
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:59,082
- Missy, I must warn you.
- What have I done?

553
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:00,987
You've looked at nobody
but me all evening.

554
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:03,136
People will begin to think you're
marrying me because you love me.

555
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,685
I'd never be able
to live that down, would I?

556
00:43:05,763 --> 00:43:07,563
All right, darling,
I won't look at you again.

557
00:43:07,598 --> 00:43:08,622
Now let's go back.

558
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:10,564
Oh, no, His Excellency,
the Judge, is in there.

559
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:13,313
- I'm afraid he may start in...
- You mustn't be unkind about Father.

560
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:14,815
I think people noticed
your expression

561
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,238
when he announced
our engagement.

562
00:43:16,307 --> 00:43:18,537
My dear, he pronounced it
like a sentence.

563
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:22,340
He is rather preposterous, darling.
He's very fond of you.

564
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:24,904
He was only teasing
about your adventures

565
00:43:24,982 --> 00:43:26,449
with the ladies of the ballet.

566
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:28,815
Oh, I'm all done with that...

567
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:31,548
that form of self-expression
by now, my dear.

568
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:34,216
- Your father should know that.
- I'll tell him.

569
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:37,784
But be nice to him, please.
He has great plans for you.

570
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:41,593
Plans? Look here, Missy,
I've served my time in the army.

571
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:42,860
Now I want to be free...

572
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:45,164
to plan my own happiness,
and yours, of course.

573
00:43:45,236 --> 00:43:47,704
Father said if you want to be free,
you must be important.

574
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:50,206
Does that mean
I must become a judge, too?

575
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:51,832
Not a bad idea, my boy.

576
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:53,706
I'll see if I can arrange it for you.

577
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:56,008
Then you can
condemn others with impunity,

578
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,014
and do as you like yourself.

579
00:43:58,082 --> 00:44:00,243
Prince Kortchagin,
I am not sure that I agree with you,

580
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:02,496
but I'm absolutely sure
that I don't want to argue about it.

581
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,520
Come along.

582
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:05,316
Don't forget
tomorrow morning, young man.

583
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:06,549
My court, nine o'clock.

584
00:44:06,624 --> 00:44:09,559
I have never done jury duty.
Can't you get me off?

585
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:11,891
No, indeed, it'll do you good.

586
00:44:11,963 --> 00:44:16,662
As a juryman, you can
consider yourself an embryonic judge.

587
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:35,043
<i>Gentlemen of the jury.
Take your seats.</i>

588
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:45,425
Everybody rise!
The court is coming!

589
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:56,098
Court is in session.

590
00:44:56,907 --> 00:44:59,034
Bring in the prisoners.

591
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:27,061
If we stick to our story,
we'll be all right.

592
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:28,901
She won't have a leg to stand on.

593
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,574
Simon Kartinkin.

594
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:35,473
- Your name.
- Simon Kartinkin.

595
00:45:35,546 --> 00:45:38,106
- Your class?
- Peasant, Your Excellency.

596
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:40,145
Religion?

597
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:42,014
Russian Orthodox,
Your Excellency.

598
00:45:42,086 --> 00:45:44,020
And your occupation?

599
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:47,546
Waiter, in establishment
of Anastasia, Your Excellency.

600
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:50,259
You have been tried before?

601
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:53,319
No, Your Excellency.
Absolutely never.

602
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:55,388
You're aware
of the charge against you?

603
00:45:55,466 --> 00:45:56,558
Oh, yes, Your Excellency.

604
00:45:56,634 --> 00:45:58,101
But I didn't do it, Your Excellency.

605
00:45:58,169 --> 00:46:01,002
- You see, Your Excellency...
- Sit down.

606
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:04,768
Euphemia Botchkova.

607
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,572
Kartinkin, sit down!

608
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:08,973
Kartinkin, sit down!

609
00:46:09,146 --> 00:46:10,807
Kartinkin, sit down!

610
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:16,018
Your name.

611
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,816
My name is Euphemia Botchkova.

612
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:19,583
Peasant. Religion, Orthodox.

613
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:22,251
I'm a servant in
the establishment of Anastasia.

614
00:46:22,326 --> 00:46:23,403
I have never been tried before,

615
00:46:23,427 --> 00:46:25,307
and I know the nature
of the charges against me.

616
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:31,867
The third prisoner?

617
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:33,870
You will rise, please.

618
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,934
- Your name.
- Lubov.

619
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:43,912
What? What's this?
You're not put down as "Lubov."

620
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:46,643
- What is your real name?
- Your baptismal name.

621
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:49,515
Formerly I was called
Katusha Maslova.

622
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:55,414
<i>Katusha... Katusha...</i>

623
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:57,723
<i>Katusha... Katusha.</i>

624
00:46:59,697 --> 00:47:01,858
- What class?
- Peasant.

625
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:04,423
- Religion?
- Orthodox.

626
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:06,561
And your occupation?

627
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:12,708
What was your employment
before your arrest?

628
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:16,405
I was in a place called
the establishment of Anastasia.

629
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:21,410
What sort of a place is that?

630
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:23,715
Oh, you know yourself.

631
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:32,660
Order! Or I'll clear the court!

632
00:47:34,598 --> 00:47:35,792
You may sit down.

633
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:43,402
Simon Kartinkin...
and Euphemia Botchkova.

634
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:46,272
You are both charged
with having stolen money

635
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:48,937
from the suitcase
of the merchant Ivan Smelkoff...

636
00:47:49,013 --> 00:47:52,949
and with having procured some poison
in the form of a powder.

637
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:57,579
And then, with having persuaded
the prisoner, Maslova,

638
00:47:57,655 --> 00:48:00,920
to give it to the merchant Smelkoff
in a glass of brandy.

639
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:03,824
And thus, caused his death.

640
00:48:03,894 --> 00:48:06,522
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

641
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:09,065
- Not guilty, Your Excellency.
- Absolutely not.

642
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:11,431
- You see...
- You may sit down.

643
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:15,203
Katusha Maslova.

644
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:18,497
Your charge is more serious.

645
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:21,977
It is that you took the money
from the merchant Smelkoff

646
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:24,071
and shared it
with the other two prisoners.

647
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:28,084
And that later, you gave the merchant
Smelkoff poison in his drink...

648
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:30,677
and thereby caused his death.

649
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:32,548
You plead guilty?

650
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:35,990
If so, a full and free confession
will be of advantage to you.

651
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,721
I'm not guilty of any of it!

652
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:41,224
Suppose you tell us
how it happened?

653
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:45,735
Well, when he, this Smelkoff,
came to the house,

654
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:47,737
He was already very drunk.

655
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:50,035
There was no way
of managing him.

656
00:48:50,107 --> 00:48:53,270
He became very difficult.

657
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:57,644
So I asked Simon and Euphemia
to help me to keep him quiet.

658
00:48:57,715 --> 00:49:00,149
They told me they had
a sleeping powder.

659
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:03,050
So they gave it to me,
and I gave it to Smelkoff.

660
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,610
Then you do plead guilty

661
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:08,021
to having given the merchant
Smelkoff the powder in his drink?

662
00:49:08,092 --> 00:49:10,287
Oh, yes, I did that.

663
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,625
Only I believed
what they told me...

664
00:49:12,696 --> 00:49:16,132
that it was a sleeping powder,
and it wouldn't do him any harm.

665
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,998
How could I ever poison a man?

666
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:22,129
I never wished...
I never thought of such a thing!

667
00:49:22,206 --> 00:49:25,403
- God as my witness.
- You may sit down.

668
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:29,873
The prosecution
may take up the case.

669
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:32,774
- We can't stay here all night!
- We are all agreed but you.

670
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,784
I am not convinced
as you all seem to be

671
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:35,852
of her innocence.

672
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:37,631
It is perfectly obvious
that she is innocent!

673
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:39,532
And that the other two
are thieves and murderers!

674
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:41,353
There isn't
the slightest doubt of it!

675
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:43,325
Well, gentlemen,
I won't hold out against you.

676
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:45,919
Perhaps you're right.
At any rate, let's get out of here.

677
00:49:45,996 --> 00:49:47,236
Excellent, sir. Thank you, sir.

678
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:50,665
Then it's agreed.
Katusha Maslova, not guilty.

679
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:52,725
Wait, sir. That's not quite it.

680
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:55,738
She is guilty of
having given him the powder.

681
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:57,467
All right, we'll word it this way.

682
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:00,806
Katusha Maslova,
guilty of giving him the powder,

683
00:50:00,878 --> 00:50:03,108
but without intent to rob...
Is that right?

684
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,114
- That's right.
- Call the attendant.

685
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:09,150
What is the matter
with those lunkheads?

686
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:11,210
Shouldn't have taken
two minutes to decide.

687
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:13,188
Girl's innocent,
and the other two are guilty.

688
00:50:13,257 --> 00:50:14,519
Even the prosecuting attorney

689
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:16,252
couldn't make out
a case against her.

690
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:17,919
Trial by jury is stupid.

691
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:20,463
Jury have reached a decision,
Your Excellency.

692
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:22,362
- Thank heaven.
- Thank heaven.

693
00:50:36,113 --> 00:50:38,775
The fools... look what
they've done. See here.

694
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:41,943
They meant to say she gave him
the powder without intent to kill.

695
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:43,384
Instead of which...

696
00:50:44,888 --> 00:50:47,413
The verdict of the jury.

697
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:55,498
We find the defendants
Kartinkin and Botchkova

698
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:57,193
guilty of robbery.

699
00:50:57,267 --> 00:51:00,964
We find the defendant,
Katusha Maslova,

700
00:51:01,038 --> 00:51:04,496
guilty of giving the powder
to the merchant Smelkoff

701
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,634
without intent to rob.

702
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:11,840
Prisoners will hear the sentence.

703
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:15,749
By his Imperial Majesty's
ukase 1-2-5,

704
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:21,121
it is decreed that the peasants
Kartinkin and Botchkova

705
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:25,184
be sent to Siberia
for penal servitude for five years.

706
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:28,231
The peasant Katusha Maslova,

707
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:30,732
on the strength
of the decision of the jury,

708
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:34,532
in accordance
with statute three, section five,

709
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:39,565
will be sent to Siberia
to work at hard labor in the mines

710
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:41,508
for five years.

711
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:44,407
<i>The court is adjourned!</i>

712
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:54,316
But I am not guilty of anything!
I'm not guilty of anything!

713
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:55,983
I didn't kill him!

714
00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:58,220
They told me
it was a sleeping powder!

715
00:51:58,295 --> 00:52:01,059
Only a sleeping powder!
I told them the truth!

716
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:02,928
I didn't kill him!

717
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,527
Prince Kortchagin!
A mistake was made.

718
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:09,231
We agreed to find Maslova guilty
only of giving the drink

719
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:11,274
without intent to rob or to kill.

720
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:14,469
But unfortunately, Dmitri,
your written verdict doesn't say that.

721
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:16,809
"Without intent to rob."
That's all it says.

722
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,025
We didn't understand
the exact procedure, Your Excellency.

723
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:21,094
We are not lawyers,
and the technicalities escaped us!

724
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:23,382
Prince Kortchagin,
the decision must be reversed!

725
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:26,582
No, Dmitri, it cannot be reversed.
At least not in this court.

726
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:28,181
But you can't let
an innocent woman...

727
00:52:28,258 --> 00:52:30,385
My dear Dmitri,
if you want to argue about it,

728
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:32,520
and I cannot imagine
why you should,

729
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:34,063
let us wait for dinner tonight.

730
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:36,599
We're due back in court
in about a moment,

731
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:39,761
and we have to try
20 revolutionaries simultaneously...

732
00:52:39,837 --> 00:52:43,398
advocates of equality for all
or some such nonsense.

733
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:47,776
What's Prince Nekhlyudov
so excited about?

734
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:50,177
He isn't the one
who's going to Siberia.

735
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:51,839
Well, he's young.

736
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,884
Now, about these radicals,
we've got to show no leniency.

737
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:56,552
They're getting dangerous,
these fellows.

738
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:10,297
What, back again?

739
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:12,198
What have they done to you?

740
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:13,998
What happened, Katusha?

741
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:21,203
Siberia... hard labor in the mines.

742
00:53:21,278 --> 00:53:24,907
Oh, don't they fear the Lord,
the cursed soul-slayers...

743
00:53:24,982 --> 00:53:26,950
sentencing a girl for nothing.

744
00:53:27,017 --> 00:53:31,010
- How many years?
- Five.

745
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:35,286
If you'd had money to hire
a good lawyer, they'd have let you off.

746
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,123
There's that one...
Oh, what's his name?

747
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:40,356
The hairy one with the long nose.

748
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,261
Why, he gets murderers acquitted

749
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:44,630
when they've got blood
wet on their hands.

750
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:48,933
Him? He wouldn't spit at you
for less than 3,000 rubles.

751
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:50,030
Have you any vodka?

752
00:53:50,107 --> 00:53:52,041
- Can you pay for it?
- Yes.

753
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:02,584
That's better.

754
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:07,013
Now tell us how it happened.

755
00:54:09,393 --> 00:54:11,293
I thought they were
going to let me off.

756
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:13,295
They all liked me.

757
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:17,527
I could see the men looking...
you know, the way they do?

758
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:19,762
But they sentenced me!

759
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:22,202
You should have made up
to some of them before the trial.

760
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:23,864
Then you'd have been all right.

761
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:27,308
What are you doing down here?
Did you smell the vodka?

762
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:30,939
Your chatter's not wanted, convict.

763
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:32,174
What are you?

764
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:34,547
Don't you come near me
or I'll murder you.

765
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:40,822
Fighting, eh?

766
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:42,017
Come here.

767
00:54:42,092 --> 00:54:44,424
I'll teach you to maul each other.

768
00:54:47,998 --> 00:54:49,522
All right, you.

769
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:02,273
- What are they giving us today?
- They call it potato soup.

770
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:07,917
How do they expect us to eat this?

771
00:55:07,985 --> 00:55:11,045
- We fed better to our swine.
- Stop complaining.

772
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:13,248
You have food
and lodging here, of a sort.

773
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:15,621
Wait. Wait until you get to Siberia.

774
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:18,092
Hush! They've just sent her there.

775
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:19,856
What were you accused of?

776
00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:25,163
Poisoning a man and robbing him.
I'm not guilty of either.

777
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:28,727
You're guilty of being poor...
as we all are.

778
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:31,899
In the eyes of our rulers,
that condemns us.

779
00:55:31,975 --> 00:55:33,943
And they throw us into prison.

780
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:37,572
We have no money...
we can't buy our freedom,

781
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:39,582
and so we're sent to Siberia.

782
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:42,585
We're poor... therefore, we're lost.

783
00:55:42,653 --> 00:55:44,416
Hush, Simonson! Hush!

784
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:47,889
- What is your name?
- Gregory Simonson.

785
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:49,391
Simonson...

786
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:53,830
- You wrote a book?
- A few.

787
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:55,159
<i>Land and...</i>

788
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:56,665
<i>Land and... Freedom.</i>

789
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:59,327
<i>Land and Freedom!</i>

790
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:01,837
I wrote that a long time ago.

791
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:05,705
Yes, a long time ago.

792
00:56:06,877 --> 00:56:08,071
What did they get you for?

793
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:10,711
Talking.

794
00:56:10,781 --> 00:56:12,908
That's a crime, too.

795
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:15,543
If you dare to raise your voice
against injustice,

796
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:16,984
you also go to Siberia!

797
00:56:17,054 --> 00:56:19,215
Because sometimes,
speech becomes action.

798
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:21,450
Therefore, those who speak
must be destroyed!

799
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:23,117
Else they become too strong!

800
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:26,129
You've done it again, eh?

801
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:27,254
Come on.

802
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,093
How many times
have you got to be told

803
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,376
to stop that revolutionary talk?

804
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,267
- Soup! I want soup!
- You'll get your soup later!

805
00:56:35,572 --> 00:56:37,369
Did you read his book?

806
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:40,376
No, but it was explained to me.

807
00:56:40,444 --> 00:56:42,810
It said that all people were equal...

808
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:44,972
and I believed it!

809
00:56:45,048 --> 00:56:48,108
And it started me
on my way to this place!

810
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:54,400
I should like to see
one of your prisoners...

811
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:55,755
Katusha Maslova.

812
00:56:55,826 --> 00:56:57,794
Oh, that one.

813
00:56:57,861 --> 00:57:01,194
- What's your name?
- Prince Nekhlyudov.

814
00:57:01,264 --> 00:57:05,394
Yes, Your Highness.
Immediately, Your Highness.

815
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:06,493
Vlasoff!

816
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:08,610
Take His Highness
to the visitors' room immediately!

817
00:57:08,672 --> 00:57:10,162
This way, Your Highness.

818
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,307
Tell them... tell them I'm dying!

819
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:08,089
- Take charge of His Highness.
- Yes, sir!

820
00:58:08,165 --> 00:58:10,861
Maslova, Maslova…

821
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:34,120
Is it me you want?

822
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:38,025
Do you know me?
Do you remember me?

823
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:40,460
I can't hear you!

824
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,090
Do you remember me?

825
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:45,634
You will have to speak louder!

826
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:48,170
This is ridiculous.
Nothing can be heard.

827
00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:50,206
Your Highness,
the rules may be changed.

828
00:58:50,273 --> 00:58:52,433
- I'll bring the prisoner into the office.
- Thank you.

829
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:56,611
Your gentleman's in there.
Take her in.

830
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:04,153
Five minutes is all
that you are permitted, sir.

831
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:05,221
Thank you.

832
00:59:11,728 --> 00:59:12,888
Don't you know me?

833
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:17,161
Oh, yes. Yes, of course I do.

834
00:59:17,234 --> 00:59:20,601
You used to
come and see me, didn't you?

835
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:23,366
Only I've forgotten your name.

836
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,465
I have a bad memory for names.

837
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:27,772
No, no...

838
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:29,869
Katusha, I am Dmitri.

839
00:59:29,946 --> 00:59:33,677
- Dmitri Nekhlyudov.
- Dmitri Ivan...

840
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,775
I was on the jury.
It was all a dreadful mistake.

841
00:59:35,852 --> 00:59:37,149
You were obviously innocent.

842
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:38,598
But we're going to
get you out of here.

843
00:59:38,622 --> 00:59:39,850
Don't you worry about that.

844
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:41,891
Dmitri Ivanov...

845
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:44,019
How did you come to this?

846
00:59:44,094 --> 00:59:46,028
Why did you leave my aunts?

847
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:48,697
Oh...

848
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:53,263
Who keeps a servant
that has a baby?

849
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:54,633
A baby?

850
00:59:57,807 --> 00:59:59,775
Where is it now?

851
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:01,936
He died.

852
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:05,778
I went to Moscow.
I tried to find work...

853
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:08,079
Why wasn't I told
about the baby?

854
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:10,642
Where were you
that I could tell you?

855
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:17,723
Why did you come here?

856
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:21,286
Why don't you let me alone now?
Haven't you done enough to me?

857
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:23,992
- Katusha, I didn't know.
- Why do you ask me questions?

858
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:25,864
Why do you make me
remember again?

859
01:00:25,936 --> 01:00:29,133
I had forgotten.
I had finished with all that.

860
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:31,730
Katusha, I must
make up to you somehow...

861
01:00:31,808 --> 01:00:35,244
No, there is nothing
you can do now.

862
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:37,974
Yes... you can leave me alone!

863
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:40,608
Katusha, let me make
some sort of recompense.

864
01:00:46,122 --> 01:00:49,580
You mean, give me money again?

865
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:53,955
Are you going to share
with the poor again...

866
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,055
Your Highness?

867
01:00:56,132 --> 01:01:00,432
Do you still believe that water
and land belong to everybody?

868
01:01:00,503 --> 01:01:03,131
- Is the air still free?
- For the love of heaven...

869
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:07,609
The foul air in this prison,
that's free to us... My Lord.

870
01:01:07,677 --> 01:01:11,477
The pure air outside,
that belongs to you.

871
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:14,483
Well, go and breathe it then.

872
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:16,781
Leave this to us,
who deserve no better.

873
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:19,822
To me and to Simonson...
do you remember him?

874
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:23,120
- Believe me, I'll do all I can.
- He is here, too.

875
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:27,459
And the air he'll breathe,
and the water he'll drink,

876
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:31,762
and his lands...
they're in Siberia!

877
01:01:31,835 --> 01:01:34,861
He's going there.
We're all going there!

878
01:01:34,938 --> 01:01:38,635
Except you, Your Highness,
Prince Nekhlyudov.

879
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:41,302
You will find it
more comfortable here!

880
01:01:41,378 --> 01:01:43,539
I deserve everything
you're saying, only let me...

881
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:45,581
I want to make amends now.

882
01:01:45,648 --> 01:01:48,014
You're overwrought.
I can understand how you feel.

883
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:49,415
I'll come back another time.

884
01:01:49,486 --> 01:01:50,714
Oh, no...

885
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:54,988
Don't come back. Ever.

886
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:57,049
Forget about it.

887
01:01:57,127 --> 01:02:01,154
It's all over and done with.

888
01:02:12,642 --> 01:02:14,576
Oh, you're back, finally.

889
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:17,112
Who was that gentleman?

890
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:19,747
What's the matter?

891
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:22,284
Something terrible
is happening to me.

892
01:02:22,352 --> 01:02:26,413
I'm coming alive!
I don't want to live!

893
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:29,014
To live is to remember!

894
01:02:29,092 --> 01:02:32,323
I mustn't do that!
It hurts too much!

895
01:02:32,395 --> 01:02:35,956
I'd rather be dead,
the way I was!

896
01:02:51,548 --> 01:02:54,381
My dear boy, if you try to
get the decision reversed

897
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:56,851
in a higher court,
frankly, I'll fight it.

898
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,978
Why?

899
01:02:58,054 --> 01:03:00,215
Well, I've never had
one of my decisions reversed.

900
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,815
I give them in strict accordance
with the letter of the law.

901
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:04,120
I did so in this case.

902
01:03:04,194 --> 01:03:06,788
I can't permit you
to make me look foolish, Dmitri.

903
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:08,023
Preposterous!

904
01:03:08,098 --> 01:03:11,693
To save your own face, you'd let
an innocent woman go to Siberia, eh?

905
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:12,928
Look at him.

906
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:16,096
Darling, anyone would think
the matter affected you personally.

907
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:19,300
That's what one of
my colleagues said this morning.

908
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,809
Why get so excited
about a woman of that sort?

909
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:23,709
A woman of that sort?

910
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,714
What about the man?

911
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:27,579
Why does he go free?

912
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:31,450
Oh, Kartinkin.
Well, we sentenced him, too.

913
01:03:31,521 --> 01:03:34,388
I mean the man
who made that girl what she is.

914
01:03:34,457 --> 01:03:35,947
Oh...

915
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:39,188
Legally, I doubt whether
we could do anything to him.

916
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:41,321
Of course,
if we knew who he was,

917
01:03:41,397 --> 01:03:44,594
we could call him on the carpet
and tell him he was a dirty dog.

918
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:47,192
Very well, then, do it.
I'm the man.

919
01:03:51,441 --> 01:03:53,773
She was a peasant
on my aunt's estate.

920
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:56,778
I had forgotten all about her.

921
01:03:56,846 --> 01:03:59,576
Well, today...

922
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:05,748
Really, darling, I'm hardly sure
this is in good taste.

923
01:04:05,822 --> 01:04:07,312
I've never before known you

924
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:09,654
to flaunt your lurid past
at the dinner table.

925
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:12,160
I am not flaunting it,
I assure you.

926
01:04:12,228 --> 01:04:14,958
But, I... I... I...

927
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:17,522
Oh, my dear fellow,
you exaggerate your guilt.

928
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,966
If it hadn't been you,
it would have been somebody else.

929
01:04:20,036 --> 01:04:21,469
Of course, Dmitri.

930
01:04:21,538 --> 01:04:23,631
Besides, what could you
have done for her afterwards?

931
01:04:23,706 --> 01:04:27,802
- Married her.
- Married a servant? My dear boy.

932
01:04:27,877 --> 01:04:29,742
At least I could have
taken care of her.

933
01:04:29,812 --> 01:04:32,804
Darling, women of that sort
take care of themselves.

934
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:35,680
Of course, if a girl in that position
gets involved with her master,

935
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:37,151
she must take the consequences.

936
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,220
Why must she?

937
01:04:38,288 --> 01:04:39,698
If it had been a girl
of my own class,

938
01:04:39,722 --> 01:04:40,966
I'd have been forced
to marry her.

939
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,821
Or be horsewhipped
out of Moscow!

940
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:45,690
True, but the world is composed
of different classes...

941
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:48,287
those who are served,
and those who do the serving.

942
01:04:48,364 --> 01:04:49,854
You can't treat them equally.

943
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:53,130
I thought and lived just that
these last few years.

944
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:55,694
But what have we done
to earn the right to eat from silver,

945
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:58,138
and be waited on by men and women
better than ourselves?

946
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,971
Why better than ourselves?

947
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:01,442
Because they serve!

948
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:04,173
Dear, dear, he's gone socialist.

949
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:05,839
Darling, after we're married,

950
01:05:05,915 --> 01:05:07,593
will you expect me
to do all the housework?

951
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:10,882
Shall I have to sweep out the rooms
and clean the silver myself?

952
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:14,219
If he allows you to keep
the house and silver, my dear.

953
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,884
A good socialist
shares with everybody.

954
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,485
Gives his lands
to the peasants, eh, Dmitri?

955
01:05:19,562 --> 01:05:21,928
I thought that was
a good idea once.

956
01:05:21,998 --> 01:05:25,729
Oh, the muddled ideals of youth.

957
01:05:25,802 --> 01:05:29,761
No, Kortchagin,
I was right then, and I'm wrong now.

958
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:33,297
I was alive then,
and I believed in something!

959
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:36,539
Now, I... I'm a shell.

960
01:05:36,613 --> 01:05:38,581
We're all shells.
We're mannequins.

961
01:05:38,648 --> 01:05:40,809
We're destined for a short life
and a bad end!

962
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:42,783
We're gluttonous and surfeited,

963
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:44,786
while all about us,
millions go hungry!

964
01:05:45,955 --> 01:05:47,081
I'm sorry.

965
01:05:47,824 --> 01:05:49,451
You must excuse me.

966
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:50,525
Dmitri!

967
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,555
My dear Prince Nekhlyudov,
I can do nothing.

968
01:05:56,633 --> 01:05:58,692
This is completely legal.

969
01:05:58,768 --> 01:06:01,100
The girl is innocent,
Your Excellency.

970
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:04,105
In every request for a pardon,
we're always first assured

971
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:05,533
of the innocence of the condemned.

972
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:07,135
It would seem
that our courts do nothing

973
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:08,768
but send innocent people to Siberia.

974
01:06:08,845 --> 01:06:10,210
I believe that's true.

975
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,441
I can do nothing for you,
Prince Nekhlyudov.

976
01:06:15,885 --> 01:06:19,719
Oh, and so!
That's why you feel responsible.

977
01:06:19,789 --> 01:06:22,121
But what has that to do with us?

978
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:26,753
Now, if we'd enjoyed
the acquaintance of the young lady,

979
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:30,026
as you have, we might feel it
necessary to do something.

980
01:06:30,099 --> 01:06:31,225
But...

981
01:06:34,737 --> 01:06:38,833
Since we have no such memories
to influence our decision,

982
01:06:38,908 --> 01:06:41,468
we can do nothing but refuse you.

983
01:06:44,113 --> 01:06:46,673
Why waste all this energy
on a peasant?

984
01:06:46,749 --> 01:06:48,774
We must keep
that sort of person in her place...

985
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:51,752
even if that place
happens to be Siberia.

986
01:06:51,821 --> 01:06:54,289
Your Highness, you can't be
entirely without pity!

987
01:06:54,357 --> 01:06:56,951
My instincts, my dear boy,
are those of our class...

988
01:06:57,026 --> 01:06:58,288
yours and mine.

989
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:01,125
We must protect what we have...
our wealth, our lands.

990
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:03,927
And we daren't show leniency,
because that's weakness.

991
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,867
If we're weak,
we may lose what we have.

992
01:07:06,936 --> 01:07:08,597
Perhaps you've heard this before.

993
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:11,697
"It is easier for a camel
to go through a needle's eye

994
01:07:11,774 --> 01:07:14,800
than for a rich man to enter
into the Kingdom of God."

995
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:18,642
I don't quite see the application!

996
01:07:18,715 --> 01:07:20,740
No, you wouldn't!

997
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:59,387
<i>It's you who have changed, not I.
I'm just as I was.</i>

998
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:01,855
<i>Every bit as much in love with you
as before I left.</i>

999
01:08:01,924 --> 01:08:06,327
<i>- It's you who have forgotten me.
- Oh. Don't say that.</i>

1000
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:13,462
<i>Please give this to Katusha.</i>

1001
01:08:34,657 --> 01:08:36,921
<i>Ht's the most moral book
ever written.</i>

1002
01:08:36,993 --> 01:08:38,551
<i>Ht says that all people are equal.</i>

1003
01:08:38,628 --> 01:08:40,339
<i>And that the land
should belong to everybody.</i>

1004
01:08:40,363 --> 01:08:42,388
<i>Yes. There.</i>

1005
01:08:42,465 --> 01:08:45,923
<i>You can remember me.
At least until these fade.</i>

1006
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:48,800
<i>And forever after.</i>

1007
01:09:42,225 --> 01:09:48,323
The Passover New and Holy.

1008
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:54,302
The Passover Mystical.

1009
01:09:54,370 --> 01:10:02,370
The Passover and Atonement.

1010
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:07,174
The Passover of all August-Christ...

1011
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:59,766
Dear Heavenly Father...

1012
01:10:59,835 --> 01:11:03,669
give me courage.

1013
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:06,902
I have so much to do...

1014
01:11:06,976 --> 01:11:10,412
so many wrongs to make right.

1015
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:16,518
Give me courage not to fail.

1016
01:11:17,954 --> 01:11:21,151
Help me, Dear God...

1017
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:24,124
to live again.

1018
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:56,320
Oh, when are you sending
the prisoners to Siberia?

1019
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:59,953
On the 25th, Your Highness.
That's two weeks from now.

1020
01:12:02,064 --> 01:12:04,430
- In the anteroom.
- Yes, sir.

1021
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,665
Katusha, I can't get you out.

1022
01:12:12,742 --> 01:12:14,676
I've tried everywhere.
They won't do it.

1023
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:15,904
Why did you come back?

1024
01:12:15,978 --> 01:12:18,208
I told you I wanted
nothing from you.

1025
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,475
I told you I wanted
only to be let alone.

1026
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:22,109
I've come back
to ask you to forgive me.

1027
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:25,176
Forgive you?
There is nothing to forgive.

1028
01:12:25,254 --> 01:12:27,552
It's all forgotten.
It's finished.

1029
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:29,386
No, Katusha, it's not finished.

1030
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:32,018
I've thought things over.
I know what I must do now.

1031
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:36,155
I must make up for my wrong to you.
Not in words, but in deeds.

1032
01:12:36,232 --> 01:12:40,168
I want you... to marry me.

1033
01:12:40,236 --> 01:12:41,863
To marry you?

1034
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:47,007
You, a prince,
want to marry a convict?

1035
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:48,509
Why?

1036
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:51,637
If I have a soul left,
I should like to save it.

1037
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:55,115
- I must do all I can...
- To save your soul through me?!

1038
01:12:55,184 --> 01:12:57,209
You disgust me!

1039
01:12:57,286 --> 01:13:00,380
Your prince's face
and your fat soul... they revolt me!

1040
01:13:00,456 --> 01:13:01,456
Do you hear?

1041
01:13:01,524 --> 01:13:04,118
I'd rather hang myself
than marry you!

1042
01:13:04,193 --> 01:13:06,127
Katusha, you must do
what I ask you.

1043
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:08,493
We still have life before us.

1044
01:13:08,564 --> 01:13:11,499
We must do all we can
to raise ourselves.

1045
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:13,694
Raise ourselves?

1046
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:16,363
You can't raise the dead!

1047
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:20,739
We won't live again.
Not you and I.

1048
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,244
Katusha, whether you marry me
or not, I shall help you.

1049
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:25,542
Can't you understand
when you're not wanted?

1050
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:29,175
Go back to your princesses!
Work for them!

1051
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:32,414
Go back to your estates,
your good food and your soft beds!

1052
01:13:32,488 --> 01:13:34,752
- That's where you belong!
- I belong with you.

1053
01:13:34,824 --> 01:13:37,054
Why did you come back?

1054
01:13:37,126 --> 01:13:39,720
I had learned to live
without happiness.

1055
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:42,161
Now you come back
and say such things to me

1056
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:43,698
and make me feel again!

1057
01:13:43,766 --> 01:13:47,361
Why do you torment me?

1058
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:54,035
I can't believe it.

1059
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:56,101
You're leaving me,
who loves you,

1060
01:13:56,178 --> 01:13:58,442
for a woman
who will love anybody?

1061
01:13:58,514 --> 01:14:01,483
- That's not kind, Missy.
- Are you being kind to me?

1062
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:06,644
Dmitri, this isn't sane.
Your entire life is here.

1063
01:14:06,722 --> 01:14:10,249
Your friends, your possessions...
can you give them all up?

1064
01:14:10,326 --> 01:14:11,588
Yes.

1065
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:15,619
I'm planning to give up
all my possessions, Missy.

1066
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:17,825
My friends...

1067
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,768
Without me, they shall still be able
to sip their tea and gossip...

1068
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:24,101
while all about them,
a nation is dying.

1069
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:25,435
And me.

1070
01:14:25,508 --> 01:14:27,772
Can you give me up so easily?

1071
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:29,834
No, Missy, not easily.

1072
01:14:29,912 --> 01:14:31,539
But I've got to do this.

1073
01:14:31,614 --> 01:14:34,947
Won't you try to understand me?
I see things differently now.

1074
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:37,144
I'm sorry, Dmitri,
but I can't believe that.

1075
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:41,417
I've never heard of a man
leaving a woman for a principle.

1076
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:46,051
He leaves her for another woman.

1077
01:14:50,633 --> 01:14:54,296
You... You're in love with that girl.

1078
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:56,395
That's it, isn't it?

1079
01:14:56,472 --> 01:14:58,463
I did her a great wrong.

1080
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,736
No, it's more than conscience.

1081
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:04,507
I can see it in your face.
You love her.

1082
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,684
Perhaps I do.

1083
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:17,915
Then that's it.

1084
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:22,530
And that I can't fight.

1085
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:12,875
Section 14. Political prisoners.

1086
01:16:13,682 --> 01:16:16,048
- Stand up, you!
- He can't. He's sick.

1087
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:18,450
Makes no difference. Stand up!

1088
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:21,948
Attention!

1089
01:16:26,695 --> 01:16:29,186
I thought we weren't
going to Siberia for two weeks.

1090
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:31,825
Why are they hurrying us off now?

1091
01:16:31,901 --> 01:16:33,869
Silence! Hold your tongue!

1092
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:35,862
If we go off now,

1093
01:16:35,938 --> 01:16:39,032
your fine friend won't have
a chance to do anything for you.

1094
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:43,671
Who, he? He won't do anything.

1095
01:16:46,115 --> 01:16:50,347
It's his conscience
he's trying to save... not me.

1096
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:52,148
Attention!

1097
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:53,415
Forward!

1098
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:54,820
March!

1099
01:17:11,307 --> 01:17:13,935
Forward! March!

1100
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:38,996
I feel the land should belong
to a man who works on it.

1101
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:41,002
That's why
I'm dividing it up in this way.

1102
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:43,402
Each of you gets
an equal amount of acreage.

1103
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:46,168
I have the deeds here.
If you'll step up, please.

1104
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:47,902
Pardon, Your Highness.

1105
01:17:47,977 --> 01:17:50,571
Now who do we pay the rent to?

1106
01:17:50,646 --> 01:17:52,204
You pay no rent.

1107
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:55,409
And for how long is
the land ours, Your Highness?

1108
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:56,974
As long as you live.

1109
01:17:57,052 --> 01:17:59,252
And after you're gone,
you may will it to your children,

1110
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:00,880
and they may give it
to their children.

1111
01:18:00,956 --> 01:18:02,651
It's yours, for always.

1112
01:18:02,725 --> 01:18:05,853
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- No, no, don't do that.

1113
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:07,122
Like this.

1114
01:18:07,196 --> 01:18:11,223
- Long live Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

1115
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,485
What's that?

1116
01:18:33,555 --> 01:18:36,922
That? That's the boundary mark.

1117
01:18:36,992 --> 01:18:40,325
When you pass beyond that,
you're in Siberia.

1118
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:44,499
And there aren't many
who ever come back from there.

1119
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:48,025
Did you hear that, Katusha?

1120
01:18:49,138 --> 01:18:52,164
What's wrong with you?
You haven't said a word for days.

1121
01:19:08,257 --> 01:19:10,068
I'd like permission
to see one of your prisoners.

1122
01:19:10,092 --> 01:19:11,092
Who are you?

1123
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,095
- Visitors are a little unusual here.
- I'm not a visitor.

1124
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:16,188
<i>I've come to join this prisoner.</i>

1125
01:19:19,368 --> 01:19:21,063
Get inside.

1126
01:19:22,037 --> 01:19:25,370
- Fetch Katusha Maslova.
- Yes, sir.

1127
01:19:25,441 --> 01:19:29,935
Maslova! Maslova!

1128
01:19:30,012 --> 01:19:31,104
Here!

1129
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,613
Katusha.

1130
01:19:32,681 --> 01:19:34,842
Come on. You're wanted.

1131
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:55,265
You have come here?

1132
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,835
I have come here
to be with you, Katusha.

1133
01:20:00,909 --> 01:20:04,072
I have nothing now.
I've given away my lands.

1134
01:20:04,146 --> 01:20:05,545
I've given up my friends.

1135
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:08,640
I have nothing
but the promise of a new life.

1136
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:12,050
And how can I live, Katusha,
until you have forgiven me?

1137
01:20:12,121 --> 01:20:13,588
How can a man truly live

1138
01:20:13,655 --> 01:20:16,453
until he has tried to undo
some of the wrong that he has done?

1139
01:20:16,525 --> 01:20:18,152
And not only the wrong I did to you,

1140
01:20:18,227 --> 01:20:21,719
but all the cruelty and injustice
of the world that I have been a part of.

1141
01:20:21,797 --> 01:20:28,225
All I ask is to live again,
with your forgiveness, and your help.

1142
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:31,199
And your love.

1143
01:20:33,142 --> 01:20:36,236
I have forgiven you,
Dmitri Ivanovitch.

1144
01:20:38,647 --> 01:20:41,241
But who am I to forgive you...

1145
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:44,112
I'm not worthy!

1146
01:20:44,186 --> 01:20:46,245
Not worthy, Katusha?

1147
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:50,280
All those who have been crushed
and insulted in life are holy.

1148
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:55,058
Those who suffer and are innocent,
as you are innocent, are holy.

1149
01:20:55,931 --> 01:20:57,262
Innocent?

1150
01:20:58,767 --> 01:21:01,463
But I am not the Katusha
you once loved, Dmitri.

1151
01:21:01,537 --> 01:21:04,665
- That was long ago.
- No, Katusha.

1152
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,937
That love has not died,
and will not die.

1153
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:12,970
Now I know that all the years between
have been mistaken and empty.

1154
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:16,848
It's the same love,
but now we are no longer children.

1155
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:20,411
I didn't know it at the time,
but now I know that all my life

1156
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:23,151
has been a search
for the happiness of those years.

1157
01:21:24,526 --> 01:21:26,790
The five years will soon be over.

1158
01:21:26,862 --> 01:21:29,956
Perhaps they back there
will be able to shorten them.

1159
01:21:30,032 --> 01:21:33,900
I shall go on with you, and wait.

1160
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:36,497
Come on, you!

1161
01:21:38,307 --> 01:21:41,606
<i>Forward! March!</i>

1162
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:47,447
Get in there.

1163
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,483
Get in line there.

1164
01:21:52,554 --> 01:21:56,547
Christ is risen from the dead,
trampling down death by death.

1165
01:21:56,625 --> 01:22:00,391
And upon those in the tomb.

1166
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:04,762
Bestowing life.

1167
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:11,762
