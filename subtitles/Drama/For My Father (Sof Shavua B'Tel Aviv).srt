1
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:43,204
Tarek.

2
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,977
Tarek, dear, you wanted me
to wake you up early.

3
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:53,014
Tarek, get up. It's late.

4
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,058
Okay.

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,528
Mother.

6
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,591
Yes, my dear.

7
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:06,199
Nothing.

8
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,500
Get up, Tarek. Get up.

9
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:09,658
Good morning.

10
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:47,030
Good morning, Katz.

11
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:49,538
Well, we'll see. Forgot me?

12
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:52,131
How could I?

13
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:00,281
- Thanks, dear.
- You're welcome.

14
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:20,798
Tarek, move over.

15
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:31,540
- Careful, slowly.
- Okay.

16
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:33,583
Take off your shirt.

17
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:56,505
It's my daughter.

18
00:03:56,573 --> 00:04:01,135
What? Not now. Later.

19
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:05,807
Okay, go with mother.

20
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:08,646
Okay, that's it. Bye.

21
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:13,181
It's Salma.
She's getting married.

22
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,985
Salma's getting married?

23
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:16,958
Yes, at Abu Ala's restaurant.

24
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:18,961
- When is the wedding?
- Next week.

25
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,520
The groom is Walid,
owner of the roasting place.

26
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,566
It'll be a great wedding.

27
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:25,794
At precisely 8:00
you push the button.

28
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:33,075
...for several months,

29
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:35,304
will probably be announced today.

30
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,313
Last night's heavy rains

31
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:39,474
caused flooding in various places.

32
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:41,813
The level of the Sea of Galilee
rose by two feet.

33
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:44,251
- Shit.
- There were traffic jams this morning.

34
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,051
A TERRORIST PENETRATED
FROM THE WEST BANK.

35
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:53,126
In Tel Aviv the security forces

36
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:55,391
ended their patrols.

37
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,839
Rehavia, come.

38
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,208
Rehavia, go down. It's Katz.

39
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,646
- Who?
- Katz.

40
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:15,514
I can't take this anymore.

41
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,645
- Pull over a minute.
- Not now.

42
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,520
I need to take a leak.

43
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:24,253
Wait, we'll be in Tel Aviv soon.

44
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:27,421
Where will I piss there?

45
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,658
You'll manage. Hold it in.

46
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:32,395
It's not healthy. I want to piss here.

47
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:34,664
Come on, Abed. Pull over.

48
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:50,579
Let him feel comfortable
before the operation.

49
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:52,679
I don't trust him.

50
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:56,453
I know him. Trust him.

51
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:59,859
I'm not sure about him.
He's like his father.

52
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,265
Shaul, are you listening?

53
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:13,468
Control, H1, over.

54
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,568
Shaul, the old man is
opening the hydrants again.

55
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:17,237
Roger, direct me.

56
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:20,147
Shaul, are you kidding me?
It's 20 meters from you.

57
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:23,311
Shit. I'll kill him.

58
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:25,718
Oh, great water.

59
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:29,088
Katz, turn off the hydrants.

60
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,217
Look what you've done
to the street.

61
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:32,955
The street looks fine to me.
A few repairs.

62
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,997
- I'm working on it.
- I'll call the police.

63
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:36,999
Shaul, leave him alone.

64
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:40,002
I'll take care of it. We'll clean up.

65
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,631
- Dad, this is my job.
- Shaul, you know him, really.

66
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:46,608
- Dad, don't interfere.
- I'm telling you, leave him alone.

67
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,576
Don't tell me not to interfere.

68
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:51,205
Okay, why yell?

69
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:54,580
Enough, what's with the water?

70
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,982
There's too much water
in the country.

71
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,417
Okay, you're right.

72
00:06:57,487 --> 00:07:01,253
Let's play dominoes.
Come on.

73
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:04,487
Girls, turn off the water.
Turn it off, come on.

74
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:11,127
- Who prepared you for this?
- Ibrahim.

75
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:14,136
- What did he tell you?
- He didn't have to tell me anything.

76
00:07:14,204 --> 00:07:16,138
What did he tell you?

77
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:18,538
I watched videos and heard stories.

78
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:20,098
What stories?

79
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:24,136
I saw children murdered.

80
00:07:24,214 --> 00:07:27,741
I saw roadblocks, beatings.

81
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,409
What else?

82
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:33,786
Shut up. I know what they did
and how they'll pay.

83
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:36,792
That's why I'm here, not you.

84
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:41,997
No wisecracks. Let's repeat it.

85
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:43,327
When do you push the button?

86
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,233
When I'm in a crowded place.

87
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:48,066
What if the police suspect you?

88
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:50,072
I go near them and push.

89
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,438
What if they're searching
people in the market?

90
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:53,976
I come near and push.

91
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,477
No.

92
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:58,639
First you try to get in,
then you push it.

93
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:00,444
What if something goes wrong?

94
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:02,007
I call you.

95
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:03,780
What number?

96
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,981
050-5411400.

97
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:08,991
Last question, no wisecracks.

98
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:11,323
All this is for the future.

99
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:17,158
What drives you to do this?

100
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,704
Since I was born
I couldn't even dream.

101
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:28,232
And that won't change
unless they are hurt.

102
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:33,580
Trust him. He's ready.

103
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:57,134
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's her.

104
00:08:57,207 --> 00:09:01,439
- How do you know her?
- She grew up next door.

105
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:05,277
Look at her,
how tight her clothes are.

106
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:09,284
Shame on her.
You can see everything.

107
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:11,445
What do you want to do?

108
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:13,887
We'll take care of the whore.

109
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:17,825
But not now. Too many people around.
We'll come back later.

110
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,669
Does it sit properly?

111
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:38,874
- Salim, the money.
- Wait. First things first.

112
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,514
Shall I connect him?

113
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,354
I have a mobile phone.

114
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:56,331
If something goes wrong
we'll set you off.

115
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,960
- How?
- We call this phone.

116
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:06,933
From now on you can't take it off.

117
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,001
The circuit passes through the buckle.

118
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,274
If you open it...

119
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:16,207
But don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

120
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:19,614
What were you saying?

121
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,983
Give all the money to my father.

122
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,859
We'll give a part of it
to your uncles.

123
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:30,229
No, give it to my father.
He'll take care of them.

124
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,792
- You sure? Your father could...
- Give it all to my father.

125
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,065
Salim, give it
to whoever he wants.

126
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:38,130
Enough. We don't have time.

127
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,039
Okay,

128
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,705
they'll have it in two weeks' time.

129
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,681
Tarek, listen.

130
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,446
We have no air force.

131
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,215
If we had an air force
we wouldn't need all this.

132
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:59,017
You're doing
something important.

133
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,928
You're our air force.

134
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,904
Cool him so he doesn't sweat.

135
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:16,872
What's wrong with you?

136
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:18,914
I feel sick.

137
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:26,021
Drink. Calm down.

138
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,784
Everything will be fine.

139
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:21,137
Want something from the market?

140
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:23,509
No, thanks. I'll go later.

141
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,107
- Keep an eye on my kiosk.
- Sure sure.

142
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,901
We're in the market,
by Amram's lovely stall.

143
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,562
Hello, Amram.
How's it going?

144
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,038
Hi, Aharoni, hi.

145
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:26,098
I love shopping in the market.

146
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:28,973
There's wonderful fruit,
lots of great vegetables,

147
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,013
the best and freshest
you can get.

148
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,344
But most of all I love
the people in the market...

149
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,350
warm, simple people

150
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:38,819
who have much more to offer.

151
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:42,415
Now it is artichoke season.
Where are these from, Amram?

152
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:44,289
The Negev desert, Aharoni.

153
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,193
Great artichokes. You can do
lots of things with their hearts.

154
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,128
They go well with olive oil, herbs.

155
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,361
- Hello.
- Tarek?

156
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:54,994
I love cooking artichoke hearts.

157
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,232
Yes, my dear. Are you in Tel Aviv?

158
00:13:57,307 --> 00:13:59,468
Yes.

159
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:02,670
- You started working?
- Soon.

160
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:05,043
Where are you, son?
I hear lots of noise around you.

161
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:09,050
I'm at the market, buying food.
I'll talk to you later, okay?

162
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:11,746
The market? May Allah keep you safe.
Take care of yourself.

163
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:14,449
They say a terrorist
got to Tel Aviv.

164
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:16,355
Don't worry, Mother.

165
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:19,190
Don't hang around.

166
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:21,492
Don't worry. I'm leaving now.

167
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:23,998
Tarek, come back to me soon, son.

168
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,728
I'll be back in two weeks.

169
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:28,396
Allah help us.

170
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:30,063
Allah be with you, son.

171
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,073
Goodbye. Mother?

172
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:48,485
Onions, garlic and herbs,
and even lemons.

173
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:50,992
Please give me
two kilos of artichokes.

174
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,789
- Do you cook artichokes?
- Sure.

175
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:54,625
- A lot? You like them?
- Yes.

176
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:58,690
- Do you cook with artichokes?
- Every week.

177
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:00,395
Give me big ones, Amram.

178
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:19,320
Do you happen to have
celery heads?

179
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:21,323
Give me two, but also big ones,

180
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:24,360
and remove the leaves.

181
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,578
It's Tarek. Shall I take it?

182
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:52,580
No, activate him.

183
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:54,513
What if he's alone?
It would be a pity, no?

184
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:58,119
Answer him, quickly.

185
00:16:58,187 --> 00:17:00,121
Hello, Tarek.

186
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:02,123
Hello.

187
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:05,251
What happened?
Anything happen? Trouble?

188
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,394
Did something go wrong?
KATZ ELECTRICIAN, REPAIRS

189
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,497
No, everything's fine.
I'm going now.

190
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:14,900
Okay, buddy. Allah help you.

191
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:16,700
Goodbye.

192
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,470
What happened?

193
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:24,172
Nothing. A mistake.
Don't worry.

194
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:25,839
Are you threatening me?

195
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:27,712
No, he doesn't know I'm here.

196
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,046
So why did you come?

197
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:31,814
I wanted to tell you
Avinoam's coming tonight.

198
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:34,516
You know him, so maybe
you won't be here.

199
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,854
- First, I don't know him.
- You do.

200
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:38,826
He's from our neighborhood too...
Avinoam.

201
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:41,591
Oh, Avinoam...
black pants and a yarmulke.

202
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:45,225
Sure sure, Shlomi. Okay,
I don't have time for your bullshit.

203
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:47,098
I'm not afraid of you.
Let him come. I'm here.

204
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,630
I'm sorry.
We'll have to come tonight.

205
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:53,004
You'll have to?

206
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:55,339
Are you coming too, Shlomi?

207
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:58,813
Go away.

208
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,775
Get out of here.

209
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,655
What are you staring at?

210
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:16,392
May I use the toilet?

211
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:18,399
What do I look like,
Social Services?

212
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,367
All day you come here
for the toilet.

213
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:22,631
Don't you have toilets
at the building site?

214
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:26,073
Building site?

215
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:28,838
No, the lawyers' office.
Yes, the building site.

216
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:32,312
You work there,
so go do your business there.

217
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:35,509
They don't have toilets.

218
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:43,519
Okay okay, but be quick about it.

219
00:18:43,593 --> 00:18:45,720
Quick.

220
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:48,025
And clean up after yourself.

221
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:50,960
Will you finally bring
someone to fix your roof?

222
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,726
Will you finally bring
someone to fix your roof?

223
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:56,958
I can fix it myself.

224
00:19:57,033 --> 00:20:00,025
I don't need some
thieving Jew to do it.

225
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:02,662
Come on, you can't fix it yourself.
You need a pro.

226
00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:05,730
I don't need anything.

227
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,276
Zipora doesn't care?

228
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:10,608
Since when does Zipora care?

229
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:16,911
What? What do you want?

230
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:23,758
It's broken.

231
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:25,919
What?

232
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:28,054
It's no good.

233
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,325
Can you repair it?

234
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:37,333
It can't be repaired.
It's burnt out.

235
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:40,204
But I have a new one.
I can get you one.

236
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,208
Want it?

237
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:48,013
Yes, I do.

238
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:50,052
You want it? So come with me.

239
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,959
What do you need it for?

240
00:20:58,027 --> 00:21:01,326
I'm from the building site.
I need it for the generator.

241
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:04,161
Okay, where is it? Here it is.

242
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,793
Here, take it.

243
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,461
No, I need the same thing.

244
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,061
It is the same.

245
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:12,869
Exactly the same.

246
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:16,343
Okay, this I don't have.
But I can order it.

247
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:18,880
Tomorrow's Shabbat.
Everything's closed.

248
00:21:18,948 --> 00:21:22,315
Come back on Sunday.
Is that okay?

249
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,522
Okay.

250
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,422
Sunday at 8:00.

251
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:34,959
At 8:00.

252
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:38,166
At 8:00.

253
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,464
Fine.

254
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:44,967
Listen.

255
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,009
Leave me alone.
Rehavia, leave it.

256
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:50,671
- You don't know anything about it.
- What don't I know?

257
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:53,180
Great.

258
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,410
Maradona.

259
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:58,180
Come here, come here.

260
00:21:58,254 --> 00:22:00,188
Where did you learn this?

261
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:03,783
In Nazareth.

262
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:07,955
Tell me, Maradona, you're Arab?
Muslim?

263
00:22:09,331 --> 00:22:12,164
So me and Katz...
we have an argument:

264
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:16,068
Which religion was first,
Christianity or Islam?

265
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:18,163
Islam started
in the seventh century.

266
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,765
We know that, but who was first?

267
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:25,614
Christianity.

268
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:28,809
- You just guessed. Shabbat shalom
- Shabbat shalom.

269
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:30,977
That's all you know...
"Shabbat shalom, Shabbat shalom."

270
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:33,613
- Read a book.
- I have.

271
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:36,055
Primitives. He doesn't even
know when he was born.

272
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,685
He just guesses by the size
of his fingernail.

273
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:41,093
I'm stuck with these primitives.

274
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,962
You need help with this?

275
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:51,472
No, I just don't have the time.

276
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,973
Why? Do you know how?

277
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:55,738
It's my job.

278
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:57,802
You just have to make
a hole in the ceiling,

279
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,848
clean and fill it... a few hours.

280
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:02,383
I know, I know.
It's just a matter of time.

281
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:04,646
I have time.

282
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,816
How much to fix that ceiling?

283
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:11,325
For the switch, okay?

284
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:13,623
Okay,

285
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:16,358
but don't tell Rehavia...
the guy who was here.

286
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:19,697
Don't tell him you work for me.
It is just between us.

287
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:21,360
No problem.

288
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:25,134
Okay, come with me to the storeroom
to get some cement.

289
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:27,198
Okay? Come.

290
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:43,884
Wait. Wait here. Wait here.

291
00:23:57,806 --> 00:24:00,969
Okay, take that
back to the shop.

292
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:05,139
I'm off to the market.
I'll be right back.

293
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:07,182
I'll be right back.

294
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:23,456
L... I work for Mr. Katz.

295
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:25,727
He asked me...

296
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:32,274
It smells of...

297
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:46,187
I must have forgotten it.

298
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:49,884
I'm here to fix
the hole in the ceiling.

299
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:14,047
What's your name?

300
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:17,575
I'm Tarek.

301
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:20,314
Thank you, Tarek.

302
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:26,859
Katz left.
I should fix it while he's gone.

303
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:28,760
Okay.

304
00:25:37,673 --> 00:25:41,871
Take off your jacket.
Aren't you hot?

305
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:45,402
No, I'm a little sick
in my nose and throat.

306
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:47,972
Would you like some tea?

307
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,677
Thanks, just water.

308
00:26:25,154 --> 00:26:27,816
Better?

309
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,858
Better.

310
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:39,966
- Hello.
- Keren.

311
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:41,332
Mother?

312
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:43,701
I called to wish you
a happy birthday.

313
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:45,296
Sweetheart, happy birthday.

314
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:47,535
- It's tomorrow.
- I know.

315
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:50,271
- Is Father home?
- He's at the synagogue.

316
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:52,314
Why didn't you go with him?

317
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:54,508
I'll pray at home.

318
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,210
What about you?

319
00:26:56,285 --> 00:26:58,253
Do you pray?

320
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:06,588
Come for the Sabbath eve meal.

321
00:27:06,662 --> 00:27:09,256
I'll talk to Father, please God.

322
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:11,322
Come, my sweet. It'll be all right.

323
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:15,735
How can I come?

324
00:27:15,804 --> 00:27:18,534
You know he won't agree.

325
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:21,007
I'll talk to him. He'll agree.

326
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:23,044
I can't come anymore.

327
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:31,083
Keren, Father is back.
I have to hang up.

328
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:32,916
Who are you talking to?

329
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:34,922
I'm ordering groceries.

330
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,151
We need coffee.

331
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:39,592
Bye, my darling.

332
00:27:47,102 --> 00:27:51,334
Katz wants some coffee,
if you have some.

333
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:53,341
I'm working for him now.

334
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:56,310
Everyone wants coffee today.

335
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:05,151
Sorry about earlier... the toilet.

336
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,348
I'm not usually like this.
It's just...

337
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:13,587
I don't know, they all
got on my nerves today.

338
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:26,173
Do you want coffee too?

339
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:29,642
I make it really well, like we do.

340
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:35,111
What do you mean,
"like we do"?

341
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:36,617
On the Kibbutz.

342
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:39,279
We make it best.

343
00:28:41,156 --> 00:28:43,784
Do you have a coffee pot?

344
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,952
Yes.

345
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,034
What's your name?

346
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:57,594
- Tarek.
- Tarek?

347
00:28:57,673 --> 00:28:59,641
- And yours?
- Keren.

348
00:29:02,778 --> 00:29:05,508
- Where are you from?
- Tulkarem.

349
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:07,640
And what are you doing here?

350
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:09,741
What can someone
from Tulkarem do?

351
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:12,343
- Renovations.
- What do you do?

352
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:15,754
I'm from a Kibbutz,
I just make coffee.

353
00:29:15,824 --> 00:29:17,587
Where did you learn
the word "kibbutz"?

354
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:20,184
In Nazareth.

355
00:29:20,262 --> 00:29:22,492
There's lots of kibbutzes there.

356
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:24,555
I thought you were from Tulkarem.

357
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,396
I am from Tulkarem,

358
00:29:26,468 --> 00:29:30,268
but I played soccer
in Nazareth for many years.

359
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,273
Really?
You must have been good.

360
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:34,536
I don't know.

361
00:29:36,245 --> 00:29:38,213
I was pretty good.

362
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:43,617
What are you doing for Katz?

363
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:45,676
Fixing the leak in his ceiling.

364
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:48,450
Really? I was sure
he was doing it himself.

365
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:50,719
Right, he really...

366
00:29:55,063 --> 00:29:57,031
Don't tell anyone, will you?

367
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,091
I forgot he said not to tell.

368
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:01,999
Don't worry.

369
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:05,940
He's a little crazy, isn't he?

370
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:08,476
He's mad at the world.

371
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:10,478
Why?

372
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:12,480
Did you see the photo on his wall?

373
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,778
Of the soldier?

374
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,818
That's his son Yakir.

375
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:19,718
He died many years ago
in the army.

376
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:23,019
Katz always says he died
because everyone here is stupid.

377
00:30:32,568 --> 00:30:34,661
Are you alone?

378
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:37,330
Yes.

379
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,340
Where is he?

380
00:30:39,408 --> 00:30:40,773
Who?

381
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,440
The boy.

382
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:49,450
I'm having a party tomorrow night
on the beach. Want to come?

383
00:30:51,753 --> 00:30:54,381
I don't know, l...
I leave on Sunday.

384
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:56,788
So tomorrow is your
last day here?

385
00:30:56,858 --> 00:30:58,985
So you have to come.

386
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:01,427
I have to go.

387
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:05,933
Come, it'll be fun.

388
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:47,371
DEATH TO THE ARABS

389
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:31,619
Tarek?

390
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:35,889
Zipora invited you to dinner.

391
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:37,549
Tonight?

392
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:39,025
Of course tonight. When else?

393
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:41,460
Thank you.

394
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:47,596
Hello.

395
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:49,159
- Where are you?
- In Tel Aviv.

396
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:52,331
Listen, you traitor,
I'll kill your parents, get it?

397
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:54,500
The button didn't work.
I'm fixing it, I swear.

398
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:57,067
- What do you mean, didn't work?
- I don't know. You gave it to me.

399
00:32:57,145 --> 00:33:00,410
- Where will you fix it?
- At a repair shop... a Jew.

400
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:03,451
If you say a word
I'll kill your father.

401
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:05,247
I won't say a word.

402
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,254
I'll have it fixed.
It'll be ready on Sunday.

403
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:09,756
Not Sunday.
Tomorrow morning.

404
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:11,884
Go to a crowded place
and we'll activate you.

405
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,258
- Tomorrow's Saturday.
- I don't care.

406
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:17,492
Tomorrow go to a crowded place...
a restaurant or cafe.

407
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:19,500
Everything's closed on Saturday.

408
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:21,502
Abed, don't you dare do anything.

409
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,164
There's no one near me.
Sunday morning I'll blow myself up.

410
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:26,867
People like you should
blow themselves up 10 times

411
00:33:26,942 --> 00:33:29,274
to clear their father's name.
Got it?

412
00:33:46,128 --> 00:33:48,619
Oh, mamaliga.

413
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:55,435
Want some?

414
00:33:55,504 --> 00:33:58,234
- No, thanks.
- You should.

415
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:01,241
Zipora makes it to die for.

416
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:11,608
Here.

417
00:34:11,686 --> 00:34:14,348
There's nothing like
Zipora's Romanian kebabs.

418
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:24,758
Eat, eat.

419
00:34:29,805 --> 00:34:32,069
The search continues
for the terrorist

420
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,267
who penetrated into Israel.

421
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:37,038
The police ask the public to be alert.

422
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:41,678
I'm going to take a shower.

423
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,012
- Dad.
- What?

424
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:45,609
What's that Arab doing at Katz's?

425
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:48,019
He's helping him to fix the leak.

426
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:50,853
- Are you sure, Dad?
- Sure I'm sure.

427
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:54,327
Did you think Katz
could fix it himself?

428
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:56,421
Katz couldn't do
anything by himself.

429
00:34:56,498 --> 00:34:59,433
If not for me, he'd have
gone under long time ago.

430
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:01,731
He can't do anything
by himself, come on.

431
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:03,930
- There's a warning out.
- So what?

432
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:07,998
You think this Maradona...?
Come on.

433
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:10,169
If someone sets off a bomb
it'll be Katz.

434
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:13,544
If so, Katz for me
is an Arab, Dad.

435
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:15,139
Dad.

436
00:35:16,518 --> 00:35:19,282
Dad, I'm no racist,
but I don't like it

437
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:21,879
that this Arab is hanging around here
on Saturday when there's a warning out.

438
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:23,686
I'm a realist.
It's dangerous.

439
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:26,420
It's in their genes.
Not in their race, in their genes.

440
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:28,428
Do you hear me?

441
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,464
Do you?

442
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:37,828
You should have known Zipora
when she was young.

443
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:40,170
Everyone was after her...

444
00:35:40,242 --> 00:35:43,575
notes on her door
in Bucharest.

445
00:35:43,645 --> 00:35:45,943
Her father would go nuts.

446
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:50,348
How she danced.
Right, Ziporale?

447
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:53,114
Ziporale, how you danced, eh?

448
00:35:53,188 --> 00:35:55,053
Everyone was crazy about her.

449
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,261
- Darling, darling.
- He's drunk.

450
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,456
I'm not drunk.

451
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:06,625
No, I'm not drunk.
I'm not drunk.

452
00:36:08,203 --> 00:36:10,728
This was a famous singer
in Bucharest.

453
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,205
The girls were crazy about him.

454
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:15,539
He had a velvet voice.

455
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:20,013
Do you know "Romeo and Juliet"?

456
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:21,776
He used to sing that.

457
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:25,013
The guy opposite
didn't talk to him.

458
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:27,816
They fought over a girl.
The entire town knew.

459
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:31,518
But when they sang
we all cried...

460
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:34,084
tears.

461
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:37,890
That was culture.

462
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:39,900
And what have we here?

463
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:41,902
Nothing.

464
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,666
Just sweat and more sweat.

465
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:46,673
No culture,

466
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:49,107
no romance, no nothing.

467
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:52,237
They took everything.

468
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,614
Once in the army

469
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:00,985
they wouldn't let
soldiers drink water.

470
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,990
In the Romanian army?

471
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:05,253
No, not that far back.

472
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:08,524
In the Israeli army
they wouldn't let soldiers drink.

473
00:37:08,596 --> 00:37:10,621
Stop it.

474
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,894
They called it "water discipline."

475
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:14,367
Stop it.

476
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:23,636
They didn't let you drink,
did they, Yakir?

477
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,087
They didn't let you drink,
did they?

478
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:38,421
How come?
A soldier.

479
00:37:38,493 --> 00:37:42,395
Boot camp, four months in.

480
00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:45,297
They didn't let him drink water.

481
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:47,130
Stop it.

482
00:37:48,737 --> 00:37:50,671
- Water.
- Come to bed.

483
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:52,673
Didn't let him drink water.

484
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:56,404
Hush. Come on.

485
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:58,708
Didn't let him drink water.

486
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:19,223
- Avinoam, don't be...
- Don't worry.

487
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,268
Everything's fine.

488
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:30,745
Don't be afraid,
nothing by force.

489
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:33,042
Keren, this is Avinoam.

490
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:35,173
Throw away your cigarette.
It's Shabbat.

491
00:38:37,118 --> 00:38:40,781
Do you love your family, Keren?

492
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:43,517
Joseph Shoshani worked
and studied all his life

493
00:38:43,591 --> 00:38:45,388
to give you a good education,

494
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,052
so you could marry
and have a family.

495
00:38:47,128 --> 00:38:49,255
I know who my father is,
but thanks anyway.

496
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,323
Your father loves you.
You're breaking his heart.

497
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:54,925
And how exactly
is that your affair?

498
00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:58,336
I didn't come here to fight.
I just came to tell you

499
00:38:58,406 --> 00:39:01,034
that your family is suffering
from your behavior.

500
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:05,876
I also wanted to see if your new
and despicable lifestyle

501
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:08,347
is making you so happy
that you're willing...

502
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:11,613
I didn't ask you that,
only how it is your business.

503
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:15,622
I know what happened,
but that's forgivable.

504
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,920
Mistakes are permitted.

505
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:21,519
We'll help you get over it...

506
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:25,191
we, the family, the community.

507
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:28,099
I don't think you'll get
such an offer here.

508
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:32,037
Here no one will help with anything,
and you know it.

509
00:39:32,107 --> 00:39:34,166
Is this how you want to live...

510
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:37,973
alone, with nothing
beyond money or beauty,

511
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:41,413
no family?

512
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:45,385
Are you happy like this?
Are you happy?

513
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:52,425
Well, we'll come back
in about three hours.

514
00:39:52,494 --> 00:39:55,395
Pack up your things
and dress properly.

515
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:58,261
Wait for us here.

516
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:07,942
So what do your parents do?

517
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:11,172
My mother was a nurse.

518
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:13,180
And your father?

519
00:40:13,248 --> 00:40:16,081
He stopped working
a long time ago.

520
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:18,085
He used to be a violin player.

521
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:20,781
He'd play for us every day at home

522
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:24,018
and the whole town knew him
from the band, the radio...

523
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:25,684
the mayor.

524
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,661
Violin... I just love it.

525
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,893
It can open the heavens.

526
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:38,800
So your father retired?

527
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:42,400
A year ago there was...
a thing with my father.

528
00:40:42,477 --> 00:40:44,707
He hasn't played since.

529
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:47,407
He won't get out of bed.

530
00:40:47,482 --> 00:40:52,112
He used to take me
to Nazareth every day...

531
00:40:52,187 --> 00:40:54,178
for me, for soccer.

532
00:40:57,392 --> 00:41:00,088
He'll be okay.

533
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:03,221
Sometimes when difficult things happen
you have to rest.

534
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:11,328
In Bucharest there was a story
about a Madame Popescu

535
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:14,705
who didn't leave her bed
for 66 years...

536
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:16,971
66 years.

537
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:19,775
Even the wedding was
in the bedroom.

538
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:23,146
Until one day when she was
already a grandmother

539
00:41:23,218 --> 00:41:25,448
she got out of bed,
went out to the town square

540
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,784
and started trying on
new dresses.

541
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:29,550
And everyone was surprised.

542
00:41:29,624 --> 00:41:32,252
Children who'd heard the story
from their mothers asked her,

543
00:41:32,327 --> 00:41:34,522
"Madame Popescu,
why aren't you in bed?"

544
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:36,393
What did she answer?

545
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:39,592
"Enough. I'm tired of it."

546
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:15,061
What?

547
00:43:15,129 --> 00:43:17,290
It's okay, Avinoam.
She can wear my jacket.

548
00:43:17,365 --> 00:43:18,957
I'm not going anywhere.

549
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:20,762
- Now you've decided you like it here?
- No.

550
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:22,860
- So what's the problem?
- No problem.

551
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:24,370
Shlomi, where does she live?

552
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:26,202
Shlomi.

553
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:28,504
Micha St., number 6.

554
00:43:28,576 --> 00:43:30,407
You see, this may end
well or badly,

555
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:32,378
but I won't let you
stain the community

556
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:34,472
hanging around
with those types.

557
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:35,982
You're coming home
with us now.

558
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,984
We'll compensate
anyone needed...

559
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:39,815
your boss, your landlord,

560
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:42,412
- so you won't have trouble.
- I'm not going anywhere.

561
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,220
Shlomi, get some water.

562
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:47,989
There's a limit to being nice.

563
00:43:48,062 --> 00:43:50,587
Hold her, Shlomi.

564
00:43:50,665 --> 00:43:54,157
You'll go home clean.
We'll make sure of that.

565
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:57,301
It's closed.

566
00:43:57,372 --> 00:44:00,273
Get out and close
the gate behind you.

567
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:03,574
Didn't you hear what I said?

568
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,441
Beat it.

569
00:44:05,513 --> 00:44:09,210
Hey, I told you to go.
Don't you understand Hebrew?

570
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:13,117
No, I don't understand.

571
00:44:13,187 --> 00:44:15,121
So now you're a whore
for Arabs?

572
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:17,419
- Want another baby?
- Bitch!

573
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:36,238
Just you wait.
It's not over yet.

574
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:46,281
Are you okay?

575
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:48,481
They know where I live.

576
00:45:30,198 --> 00:45:32,132
WATER DISCIPLINE
ABOLISHED IN IDF

577
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,690
YAKIR KATZ'S SUPERIORS
CLEARED

578
00:45:36,204 --> 00:45:40,368
COMMITTEE FORMED TO INVESTIGATE
PRIVATE YAKIR KATZ' DEATH

579
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:43,205
All parents stay alive.

580
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:12,539
What, you're leaving?

581
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,802
Yes, I'll go to Katz's.

582
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:17,709
Stay with me until I fall asleep.

583
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:34,856
Why do they...?

584
00:46:34,929 --> 00:46:37,796
They don't like girls
walking around like I do.

585
00:46:42,203 --> 00:46:45,468
Walking around?

586
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:49,601
Dressed like me...
with earrings and hair.

587
00:46:49,677 --> 00:46:53,875
And they go to all the girls
who do that?

588
00:46:55,016 --> 00:46:58,042
No, not all.

589
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:00,087
It's a long story.

590
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:05,625
Maybe they'll come back.

591
00:47:05,693 --> 00:47:08,389
On Sunday I'll talk
to my cousins.

592
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:12,364
They'll take care of it.

593
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:14,367
Are they strong?

594
00:47:14,435 --> 00:47:16,926
Very strong.

595
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,303
They're the only ones
I still talk to.

596
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:23,969
So you'll sleep here
until Sunday?

597
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:32,209
Until Sunday I'm with you.

598
00:47:38,793 --> 00:47:41,523
Tell me a story
to make me sleep.

599
00:47:41,596 --> 00:47:44,861
I don't have many stories.

600
00:47:44,932 --> 00:47:47,423
Anything, about your home,

601
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:50,937
your family, about Tulkarem.

602
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,998
Those aren't bedtime stories.

603
00:47:56,077 --> 00:47:58,045
Just any story.

604
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:03,611
Any story?

605
00:48:03,684 --> 00:48:04,981
Okay.

606
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:10,885
Today I had dinner
with Katz and Zipora

607
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:14,359
and Zipora made
special Romanian food...

608
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:18,159
Mamaliga, kebabs.

609
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:22,066
And Katz told us about
the singers in Romania.

610
00:48:25,006 --> 00:48:27,440
But...

611
00:48:27,508 --> 00:48:30,375
Zipora is a bit sad.

612
00:48:30,444 --> 00:48:34,847
She... maybe she doesn't
want to go on.

613
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:40,045
This afternoon
she didn't want to go on.

614
00:48:51,065 --> 00:48:53,465
Sometimes I don't
want to either.

615
00:49:33,374 --> 00:49:35,899
Good morning, sleepyhead.

616
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:40,008
Where are you going so early?

617
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:43,312
To the dining hall.
Then I'll take you to the fields.

618
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:46,616
Why? Because I'm Arab?

619
00:49:46,687 --> 00:49:49,087
Well... come on.

620
00:49:55,096 --> 00:49:57,087
Ahmed.
Ahmed.

621
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:59,462
Don't worry, it's Shaul.

622
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:02,093
Ahmed, come here.

623
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:04,069
He's just a parking warden.

624
00:50:04,138 --> 00:50:05,833
I'm not a parking warden.

625
00:50:05,906 --> 00:50:09,069
I'm a municipal inspector,
and you're in my jurisdiction.

626
00:50:09,143 --> 00:50:11,509
- Your jurisdiction?
- Yes, my jurisdiction, Ahmed.

627
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,013
- His name isn't Ahmed.
- Don't interfere.

628
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:17,573
Ahmed, go to the wall over there
and put your hands on it.

629
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:23,716
- Shaul, what are you doing?
- I'm going to search him.

630
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:26,726
- Come on.
- Rehavia, calm your son down.

631
00:50:26,794 --> 00:50:29,024
Katz, don't interfere.
Arabs come here on Shabbat,

632
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:30,825
hang around as if
in their mother's home.

633
00:50:30,898 --> 00:50:32,832
Listen, he's with me,
so don't cause trouble.

634
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,596
What's he doing with you?

635
00:50:35,669 --> 00:50:38,968
Ahmed, what are you
doing with him?

636
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:42,309
Nothing.

637
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:45,812
Tell me, you 're fixing
the leak, aren't you?

638
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:49,640
No.

639
00:50:49,717 --> 00:50:53,118
- So he's fixing my leak.
- I knew it.

640
00:50:53,187 --> 00:50:56,281
Good for you.
Now take him and get out of here.

641
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:57,790
- Shaul, enough.
- Why?

642
00:50:57,858 --> 00:50:59,792
I have nothing
against this Arab,

643
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,852
but as far as I know,
only Arabs commit bombings here.

644
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,091
If Indians were committing bombings,
I'd search them.

645
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,862
Listen, if you don't get lost
within one minute

646
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:11,336
I'll call the police and say
you're impersonating a police officer

647
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:14,340
and I'll tell God you're impersonating
a human being.

648
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:17,070
Now shut the hell up
and get out of here.

649
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:19,544
Get him away, Rehavia.

650
00:51:19,613 --> 00:51:23,208
Okay, Shaul, come on home.
Come home, let's go.

651
00:51:23,284 --> 00:51:26,720
Enough. Enough.
Come on!

652
00:51:26,787 --> 00:51:28,482
That's enough.

653
00:51:31,892 --> 00:51:33,689
Asshole.

654
00:51:41,235 --> 00:51:45,331
Don't listen to him. Let's go.

655
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:47,340
Where?

656
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:50,206
To the synagogue.

657
00:51:53,347 --> 00:51:55,281
The synagogue?

658
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:57,510
To meet my family.

659
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:15,462
Wait a minute, okay?

660
00:53:39,586 --> 00:53:41,053
Sweetheart.

661
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:49,652
- Is Father inside?
- Yes.

662
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,823
Do you want me
to get him?

663
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:55,801
- No.
- Why not?

664
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:58,269
It won't change anything.

665
00:53:58,339 --> 00:54:00,933
Keren, he's your father.

666
00:54:05,145 --> 00:54:07,670
How are you managing?

667
00:54:11,218 --> 00:54:13,686
Do you have any money?

668
00:54:13,754 --> 00:54:16,416
Honey, no money at all?

669
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:22,553
No, it's Shabbat.

670
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:25,189
Take it.
No time for Shabbat now.

671
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:27,859
Sweetie, come home,
I beg you.

672
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:32,572
Right, I have to go in.

673
00:54:42,716 --> 00:54:44,684
Take care of her.

674
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,770
I feel like I'm exploding.

675
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:16,543
It's just everything's
such a mess.

676
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:33,091
You're not religious anymore?

677
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:35,658
Not for a year.

678
00:55:35,736 --> 00:55:38,398
Why?

679
00:55:38,472 --> 00:55:40,531
I did something
that God doesn't forgive.

680
00:55:40,607 --> 00:55:43,508
Something bad?

681
00:55:43,577 --> 00:55:46,273
Something good.

682
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:49,076
I had a little baby in my belly.

683
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:52,778
He died three months
before I was due.

684
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:56,789
Everyone said it was
God's punishment.

685
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:59,121
I wasn't married.

686
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:04,193
And God won't forgive you?

687
00:56:04,264 --> 00:56:07,461
I don't want Him to anymore.

688
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:13,497
Do you think there is a God?

689
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:15,542
I don't know.

690
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:18,442
Maybe not.

691
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:23,142
If I knew there was life after death
I'd kill myself.

692
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:25,651
Maybe that's why you don't know.

693
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:29,721
So I won't die?

694
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,724
So you live.

695
00:56:36,263 --> 00:56:37,525
Hello.

696
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,623
Did you find a place?

697
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,032
There aren't any people.
It's Sabbath. Tomorrow.

698
00:56:42,102 --> 00:56:43,592
No, today.

699
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:46,434
Trust me, I'll fix
the button tomorrow.

700
00:56:46,507 --> 00:56:48,839
Trust you?
Where are you?

701
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:52,936
I'm in Tel Aviv.
But there's no one around.

702
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:54,275
Tarek.

703
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:57,613
Are there people around you?
Salim, activate him.

704
00:56:57,684 --> 00:56:59,618
Tarek.

705
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:01,984
I have to go.

706
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:03,989
- Tarek.
- Go away.

707
00:57:04,057 --> 00:57:06,753
- What are you doing?
- Go away.

708
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:08,590
- What did I do?
- Nothing.

709
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:10,960
I'll explain later.
Please go.

710
00:57:11,031 --> 00:57:12,328
Tarek.

711
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:15,493
- Activate him, Salim.
- No, let him do it.

712
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:17,730
Tarek.

713
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:19,101
Tarek.

714
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:24,706
What did I do?

715
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:26,746
Tarek, wait.

716
00:57:28,348 --> 00:57:29,713
Tarek.

717
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:38,385
Go away.

718
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,858
They'll find out by tomorrow.

719
00:57:40,928 --> 00:57:42,361
They've said it on the radio.

720
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:44,090
- Activate him.
- But it's Saturday.

721
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:46,029
- Go away.
- What did I do?

722
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:48,226
- Go away.
- Why? What did I do?

723
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:51,100
Nothing. I'll explain later.
Please go.

724
00:57:57,377 --> 00:57:59,174
What, you're doing yoga now?

725
00:58:01,582 --> 00:58:04,449
Everyone's screwed up here.

726
00:58:04,518 --> 00:58:06,782
No people around,
and the restaurants have guards.

727
00:58:06,853 --> 00:58:10,414
Trust me, tomorrow morning
he'll go to the market

728
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,355
and blow up 50 Jews

729
00:58:12,426 --> 00:58:15,224
instead of a couple of old ladies.
It's a waste.

730
00:58:15,295 --> 00:58:17,820
Trust me, let him do it himself.

731
00:58:17,898 --> 00:58:21,925
Besides, if Command knew
we activated him without his consent

732
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:26,268
we'd have trouble.
You know that, don't you?

733
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:29,104
Tomorrow 8:00 in the morning,

734
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:32,043
or we'll be in trouble.

735
00:58:32,112 --> 00:58:34,512
No problem.

736
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:55,962
Hello.

737
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:58,402
We won't activate you.
I convinced him.

738
00:58:58,472 --> 00:59:01,635
- But tomorrow for sure, right?
- Sure.

739
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,176
Okay, buddy.
Go to the beach.

740
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:07,577
The sun is shining, no?

741
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:08,842
Almost.

742
00:59:08,915 --> 00:59:11,509
How's Tel Aviv?

743
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:12,984
Great.

744
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:15,920
Okay, I gotta go.
We'll talk later.

745
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:29,765
Have you calmed down?

746
00:59:29,836 --> 00:59:33,203
- What?
- What's the matter with you?

747
00:59:33,273 --> 00:59:34,604
I don't know.

748
00:59:58,565 --> 01:00:02,626
What planet are you from,
you nutcase?

749
01:00:02,703 --> 01:00:04,637
What do I know?
From Tulkarem.

750
01:00:04,705 --> 01:00:08,368
Were you really a soccer player,
a builder, a Kibbutznik and all that?

751
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:10,808
More or less.
Except a Kibbutznik.

752
01:00:10,877 --> 01:00:15,041
- And what are you doing here?
- That's a long story.

753
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:17,140
So tell me.

754
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:21,044
I started playing

755
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:23,214
in the neighborhood team
in Tulkarem.

756
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:30,029
One day a sports announcer,

757
01:00:30,097 --> 01:00:32,258
Arab, very famous, saw me.

758
01:00:32,332 --> 01:00:35,790
In that game I scored
and we won.

759
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:38,599
And Salah, the radio announcer,

760
01:00:38,672 --> 01:00:41,197
talked to my dad after the game.

761
01:00:41,274 --> 01:00:43,868
He suggested I should
play in Nazareth,

762
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:45,969
and that's how I got there.

763
01:00:46,046 --> 01:00:50,642
Every day my dad drove me
an hour and a half each way.

764
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:54,050
The trouble started
with the Intifada,

765
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:58,182
so it was difficult to get
through... roadblocks.

766
01:00:58,258 --> 01:01:02,957
But it didn't always work,
so we would run.

767
01:01:03,029 --> 01:01:06,123
That's how it went on
for months.

768
01:01:09,202 --> 01:01:13,161
My father realized we'd have to go back
to the roadblocks.

769
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,971
Then it was more difficult
to get through.

770
01:01:17,043 --> 01:01:21,503
I didn't want to go
to the training anymore.

771
01:01:21,581 --> 01:01:23,640
I couldn't bear the humiliation,

772
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:26,277
couldn't see the soldiers,

773
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:28,844
so happy that we were
ready to do anything

774
01:01:28,922 --> 01:01:31,550
just to cross the roadblock.

775
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:34,890
But my father wouldn't give up.

776
01:01:34,961 --> 01:01:38,055
Soccer's above everything, see?

777
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:42,192
He was crazy for soccer.
I liked to play,

778
01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:44,760
but I also liked other things.

779
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:49,207
But he loved it
more than his violin.

780
01:01:49,276 --> 01:01:53,337
He'd watch my games
wearing earphones...

781
01:01:53,413 --> 01:01:56,905
you know, "Songs and Goals,"
the sports program...

782
01:01:56,983 --> 01:02:01,147
so as not to miss any goal
in any game.

783
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:04,384
After a while

784
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:08,394
the bombings
and the operations started.

785
01:02:08,462 --> 01:02:11,158
You couldn't cross
without special passes.

786
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:14,029
So he got these passes.

787
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,558
Ali, Ali, Ali,
you're not a kid anymore.

788
01:02:17,637 --> 01:02:20,333
You know that if I don't
get something real

789
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:23,137
you won't get your passes
until the year 2050!

790
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:27,613
Ali, you're forcing me here.

791
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:30,750
So we got through
another year.

792
01:02:32,752 --> 01:02:36,381
After a year rumors began.

793
01:02:36,456 --> 01:02:39,084
Everyone gave us the eye,

794
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:41,059
but my dad said,

795
01:02:41,127 --> 01:02:44,290
"Never mind, it'll pass."

796
01:02:44,364 --> 01:02:46,764
I knew it wouldn't pass.

797
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:54,196
The rumors about my father
reached the Tanzim,

798
01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:58,267
and then it was all over...

799
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,745
no more Nazareth.

800
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:06,179
And now?

801
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:07,686
Where?

802
01:03:07,754 --> 01:03:11,121
- In Tulkarem.
- It's shit.

803
01:03:12,225 --> 01:03:14,090
Because of the situation?

804
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,129
Because of everything.

805
01:03:17,197 --> 01:03:19,495
Also in my family.

806
01:03:19,566 --> 01:03:22,057
We're like a ruined family.

807
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:25,036
Our reputation is ruined.

808
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:28,336
And for us
a bad reputation is bad.

809
01:03:30,076 --> 01:03:32,874
Can't you clear him?

810
01:03:37,284 --> 01:03:39,411
I can.

811
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:44,389
But not with a rag.

812
01:03:44,457 --> 01:03:47,858
Are you angry at them...

813
01:03:47,928 --> 01:03:50,192
the Tanzim?

814
01:03:50,263 --> 01:03:52,288
What?

815
01:03:52,365 --> 01:03:55,357
For what they did
to your father, and the soccer.

816
01:03:56,403 --> 01:03:58,963
They?

817
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,442
You're a little girl.
You don't understand anything.

818
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:06,001
I'm not angry at people
who barely have anything to eat.

819
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,309
I'm angry at...

820
01:04:08,381 --> 01:04:10,440
whomever I'm angry at.

821
01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:23,055
Tarek, wait.

822
01:04:23,129 --> 01:04:25,120
Tarek, wait a minute.

823
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:33,165
- I didn't mean it.
- Go away.

824
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:36,902
Go back to your kiosk
and your nonsense.

825
01:05:57,957 --> 01:06:00,084
I'm sorry.

826
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,494
I didn't know you were angry
at whoever you were.

827
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:10,793
Do you know who I'm angry at?

828
01:06:12,739 --> 01:06:14,536
At me?

829
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:20,439
I'm angry at everyone except you.

830
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:29,147
We're enjoying the great
atmosphere of the stadium,

831
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:31,156
but first the lineup:

832
01:06:31,224 --> 01:06:34,819
Ayash, Mussa, Keinan
and Lockman in defense.

833
01:06:34,894 --> 01:06:37,658
Our reporter Salah in a short interview
with Nazareth's trainer.

834
01:06:37,731 --> 01:06:40,461
Over to you, Salah.

835
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:42,228
Salah?

836
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:45,999
Salah, can you hear me?

837
01:06:46,072 --> 01:06:48,404
We seem to have a technical problem.
We'll try to solve it

838
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:52,707
in a short while. Meanwhile,
back to the studio for songs.

839
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:10,153
Hello, Katz.

840
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:13,791
We have a problem with the recorder.
Could you take a look?

841
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:16,893
Again? When will you guys buy new ones?
This is older than me.

842
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:19,495
If we replace them we won't see you.
Be a shame, no?

843
01:07:19,572 --> 01:07:21,369
- Okay. Show me.
- Here.

844
01:07:21,441 --> 01:07:24,638
I'll check it inside.

845
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:34,147
I'm going to pack.

846
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:36,347
You're not going
back home now.

847
01:07:36,422 --> 01:07:37,821
No, don't worry.

848
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:39,882
I'm just taking a few things
for the campfire.

849
01:07:43,863 --> 01:07:45,660
Tarek?

850
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:48,394
Tarek Rana?

851
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:52,495
Where did you disappear to?
Where are you?

852
01:07:52,572 --> 01:07:54,369
I'm here.

853
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:59,244
Goal!

854
01:07:59,312 --> 01:08:01,712
I don't believe it!

855
01:08:01,781 --> 01:08:05,114
Maccabi Nazareth: 1.
Maccabi Tel Aviv: 0.

856
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:06,880
Where did you disappear to?

857
01:08:06,953 --> 01:08:09,649
I went back to Tulkarem.
Things didn't work out after my injury.

858
01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:12,384
Well, when are you coming back?

859
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,187
I'm not.

860
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,423
What do you mean?
What does your father say?

861
01:08:17,497 --> 01:08:19,522
- About what?
- About soccer.

862
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:21,533
My father's out of it.

863
01:08:21,601 --> 01:08:23,535
What do you mean?

864
01:08:23,603 --> 01:08:25,798
He's out of it since the injury.

865
01:08:25,872 --> 01:08:28,773
Wait wait, I'll talk to Samir
and tell him you're here.

866
01:08:28,842 --> 01:08:31,777
- Don't bother, Salah.
- What do you mean? Wait.

867
01:08:31,845 --> 01:08:34,678
Hello, Samir?
I'm here with Tarek Rana

868
01:08:34,747 --> 01:08:36,681
from Nazareth.
Remember him?

869
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:41,118
Sure I remember.
Wait, I'll put you on the air.

870
01:08:41,187 --> 01:08:43,883
I just learned that
our reporter Salah Huri

871
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:45,652
is talking to someone
who till a year ago

872
01:08:45,725 --> 01:08:48,455
was one of the most promising
junior talents at Nazareth,

873
01:08:48,528 --> 01:08:51,053
and who even played with the club.
Over to you, Salah.

874
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:55,260
Yes, I'm here with Tarek Rana,
who's been away for a year.

875
01:08:55,335 --> 01:08:58,532
Together we're hearing your
wonderful crowd. Over to you.

876
01:08:58,605 --> 01:09:02,132
Tell Tarek to get well soon.
We haven't forgotten.

877
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:04,142
Tarek's on the radio.

878
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:06,235
If he were here with us today
it could have been 2-0

879
01:09:06,312 --> 01:09:08,280
and we could take a breath.

880
01:09:08,348 --> 01:09:10,942
We hope we'll see him on the field
in Nazareth as soon as possible.

881
01:09:11,017 --> 01:09:13,884
What do you say to that, Tarek?

882
01:09:16,623 --> 01:09:20,559
I... was injured.

883
01:09:30,436 --> 01:09:32,404
Thank you, Tarek.
Thank you, Samir.

884
01:09:32,472 --> 01:09:34,337
Back to you.

885
01:09:34,407 --> 01:09:36,568
Thank you.
And thank you, Tarek Rana.

886
01:09:36,643 --> 01:09:40,044
And now back to Bloomfield.

887
01:09:40,113 --> 01:09:43,571
What about your injury?

888
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:45,641
Did you go to a good doctor?

889
01:09:45,718 --> 01:09:47,151
I know a doctor...

890
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,485
Salah, I wasn't injured.

891
01:09:50,556 --> 01:09:52,456
I know.

892
01:09:52,525 --> 01:09:54,652
My father got into trouble.
We couldn't go to Nazareth.

893
01:09:54,727 --> 01:09:57,423
Who stopped you?

894
01:09:57,497 --> 01:10:00,625
Forget it.
This is too big even for you.

895
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,668
Okay, I'll forget it.

896
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:04,566
But what now?

897
01:10:04,637 --> 01:10:06,195
Now nothing.

898
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:11,934
Nothing.

899
01:10:12,011 --> 01:10:13,808
Tarek, I can help you.

900
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,213
Salah, don't you get it?

901
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:19,217
Of course not.
You're not telling me.

902
01:10:19,285 --> 01:10:21,583
- I got into trouble.
- What trouble?

903
01:10:21,654 --> 01:10:25,283
With the Tanzim.
You know the situation.

904
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:28,816
Are you working for them?

905
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:30,487
Terrorist stuff?

906
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:34,499
- No, are you crazy?
- So what do you do?

907
01:10:34,567 --> 01:10:38,765
I just check.
Sometimes I go in.

908
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:40,965
How did you get
through the roadblocks?

909
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,873
They got me a pass.

910
01:10:43,943 --> 01:10:45,911
Till when?

911
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:47,913
Work permit for three months.

912
01:10:47,981 --> 01:10:49,778
Are they watching you?

913
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:54,383
Yes.

914
01:10:56,022 --> 01:10:59,583
Okay, come to me tomorrow.
We'll see what we can do.

915
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:01,593
It's hard. I was in trouble.

916
01:11:01,661 --> 01:11:04,357
Come tomorrow. We'll see.

917
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:07,422
- I'm going away tomorrow.
- You're not going anywhere.

918
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,062
You're a soccer player and
you need to start training gradually.

919
01:11:12,138 --> 01:11:14,129
Promise me you'll come tomorrow.

920
01:11:20,213 --> 01:11:23,307
It's too late. Even if I wanted to,
it's no longer in my hands.

921
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:26,079
Do you want to?

922
01:11:29,222 --> 01:11:30,849
Maybe I do.

923
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:36,591
Promise me you'll come.
You'll lose nothing.

924
01:11:36,662 --> 01:11:39,028
Trust me.

925
01:11:39,098 --> 01:11:42,261
I know a lot of people here,
not just soccer people.

926
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,269
Let's see what we can do.

927
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:47,636
Just come tomorrow.

928
01:11:47,707 --> 01:11:50,642
Promise?

929
01:11:53,046 --> 01:11:54,843
Promise?

930
01:11:54,914 --> 01:11:57,280
I'll come.

931
01:12:01,421 --> 01:12:03,412
Okay, say hi to your father.

932
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:10,562
Tell him to invite me to a concert.
I love good music.

933
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:14,157
He stopped playing,
even stopped watching soccer.

934
01:12:14,233 --> 01:12:16,497
Your father was never
a great soccer fan.

935
01:12:16,569 --> 01:12:19,265
What?

936
01:12:19,338 --> 01:12:22,899
He'd come to the games
with earphones.

937
01:12:22,975 --> 01:12:24,772
"Goals and Songs."

938
01:12:24,844 --> 01:12:26,778
Songs. Songs.

939
01:12:26,846 --> 01:12:29,076
Goals were yours.

940
01:12:31,918 --> 01:12:34,751
He's a violin player.
What is soccer to him?

941
01:12:43,963 --> 01:12:47,524
Thank you very much, Katz.
See you, 'bye.

942
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:38,808
Messiah, Messiah, Messiah.

943
01:13:38,885 --> 01:13:41,547
Here. Her bike is here.

944
01:13:41,621 --> 01:13:43,111
Keren.

945
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:45,680
- Keren, come out.
- Keren.

946
01:13:53,533 --> 01:13:57,629
Maybe they can't find us.

947
01:13:57,703 --> 01:14:01,036
They won't come.

948
01:14:01,107 --> 01:14:04,167
Why not? Sure they'll come.

949
01:14:04,243 --> 01:14:06,609
No one will come.

950
01:14:08,514 --> 01:14:10,641
Okay, they're not here. Let's go.

951
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:13,241
- Yeah, he's right. Let's go.
- Cowards.

952
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:17,312
There's an Arab with a knife
hanging around, and you want to go?

953
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:20,450
Okay, you go. I'll stay
and take care of him alone.

954
01:14:20,526 --> 01:14:23,791
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know,

955
01:14:23,863 --> 01:14:26,559
I won't let an Arab
attack me in my own country.

956
01:14:26,632 --> 01:14:28,293
Everything all right?

957
01:14:28,367 --> 01:14:30,301
Are you waiting for someone?

958
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:33,998
We're waiting for a friend.

959
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:39,671
I brought lots of food.
What a waste.

960
01:14:39,745 --> 01:14:41,713
Why a waste?
I'm hungry.

961
01:14:41,781 --> 01:14:43,874
I eat like 20 of your friends.

962
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,918
They're not my friends.

963
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,213
I don't have any friends.

964
01:14:54,727 --> 01:14:57,389
I see. I'll take it from here.

965
01:14:57,463 --> 01:14:59,454
Go home. This is no joke.

966
01:14:59,532 --> 01:15:02,592
You'll just be in the way.
We'll deal with this.

967
01:15:02,668 --> 01:15:05,000
I too don't want an Arab
with a knife hanging around,

968
01:15:05,071 --> 01:15:08,097
and whatever else he has.
Go on, go home.

969
01:15:08,174 --> 01:15:10,904
Go home, go home.

970
01:15:30,529 --> 01:15:33,123
Let's go in.

971
01:15:34,567 --> 01:15:36,501
What?

972
01:15:36,569 --> 01:15:38,935
Now?

973
01:15:39,972 --> 01:15:42,668
Let's go in.

974
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,780
You go in.

975
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:51,476
I'll go in later.

976
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,745
Come on, go in with me.

977
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,158
Okay, so turn around.

978
01:16:10,536 --> 01:16:12,766
Don't peep.

979
01:16:23,215 --> 01:16:25,274
Are you coming?

980
01:16:31,457 --> 01:16:33,584
Not today.

981
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:37,891
Come on, Tarek.
You only live once. Come on.

982
01:17:22,007 --> 01:17:23,167
Hello.

983
01:17:23,242 --> 01:17:24,641
Mother.

984
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:26,302
Tarek.

985
01:17:26,379 --> 01:17:29,348
Where are you, son?

986
01:17:29,415 --> 01:17:31,610
We heard you on the radio.

987
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:33,379
Let me talk to Father.

988
01:17:33,452 --> 01:17:37,388
Your father is a little tired.

989
01:17:37,456 --> 01:17:39,048
He's asleep.

990
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:42,219
Mother, let me talk to Father.

991
01:17:54,874 --> 01:17:56,774
Father.

992
01:17:56,842 --> 01:17:59,037
Yes?

993
01:18:00,946 --> 01:18:02,379
I saw Salah today.

994
01:18:02,448 --> 01:18:04,211
I know.

995
01:18:04,283 --> 01:18:07,741
Nazareth beat Maccabi Tel Aviv,

996
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:10,448
made it to the semifinals.

997
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:12,457
Didn't you hear?

998
01:18:12,525 --> 01:18:15,824
Of course I did.

999
01:18:17,096 --> 01:18:19,291
I heard you, son.

1000
01:18:19,365 --> 01:18:21,458
How will this end, Father?

1001
01:18:21,534 --> 01:18:23,866
Come back home.

1002
01:18:23,936 --> 01:18:25,961
God bless you, son.
Come back home.

1003
01:18:29,008 --> 01:18:30,600
Don't worry.

1004
01:18:30,676 --> 01:18:34,442
I'll be back soon, God willing.

1005
01:18:34,513 --> 01:18:36,777
Everything will be okay.

1006
01:18:40,286 --> 01:18:43,119
Father,

1007
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:45,714
take care of yourself.

1008
01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:59,967
It's cold.

1009
01:19:11,116 --> 01:19:14,142
Who was that?

1010
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:16,188
My father.

1011
01:19:19,158 --> 01:19:21,285
Everything okay?

1012
01:19:23,662 --> 01:19:25,687
He'll be okay.

1013
01:19:25,764 --> 01:19:29,063
I think he'll be okay.

1014
01:19:32,471 --> 01:19:35,565
So why are you sad?

1015
01:19:35,641 --> 01:19:37,336
I don't know.

1016
01:19:40,246 --> 01:19:42,840
I'm not sad.

1017
01:19:44,316 --> 01:19:46,307
I'm okay.

1018
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:37,760
You're my friend, aren't you?

1019
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:44,239
I'm your friend.

1020
01:21:26,952 --> 01:21:28,283
Hello.

1021
01:21:28,354 --> 01:21:31,084
It's Abed. You ready?

1022
01:21:31,156 --> 01:21:32,589
What?

1023
01:21:32,658 --> 01:21:35,627
In an hour at precisely 8:00,
the entrance to the market.

1024
01:21:39,264 --> 01:21:40,697
8:00?

1025
01:21:40,766 --> 01:21:43,360
No screw-ups.
You remember last year?

1026
01:21:43,435 --> 01:21:45,335
This time it won't pass.

1027
01:21:51,677 --> 01:21:54,908
Tarek, don't change your mind.

1028
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:57,141
Remember our talk two days ago...

1029
01:21:57,216 --> 01:21:59,150
what you are for us.

1030
01:21:59,218 --> 01:22:02,551
I'm not for you or anyone.

1031
01:22:02,621 --> 01:22:05,317
8:00, the entrance to the market.

1032
01:24:09,148 --> 01:24:11,514
Good morning, Maradona.

1033
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:13,813
Shalom.

1034
01:24:13,886 --> 01:24:16,650
Have a good time, Maradona.

1035
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:42,444
He's on his way to the market.
I'm following.

1036
01:25:33,298 --> 01:25:36,324
Tarek, I've been waiting
a long time.

1037
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:39,199
Mr. Katz,

1038
01:25:39,271 --> 01:25:41,364
please go away.

1039
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,135
Want me to go away?

1040
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:45,938
I've been shopping here
for 40 years. You go away.

1041
01:25:46,011 --> 01:25:48,002
- I can't.
- You can.

1042
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:51,277
The suspect is wearing a brown jacket...
the third stall on the right.

1043
01:25:52,684 --> 01:25:55,346
Mr. Katz, please leave.

1044
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:56,853
Why are you doing this?

1045
01:25:56,922 --> 01:25:58,947
- Go away.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1046
01:25:59,024 --> 01:26:01,925
I'm with you now wherever you go.

1047
01:26:01,994 --> 01:26:03,461
Katz...

1048
01:26:03,528 --> 01:26:05,257
What are you going to do?
Kill me?

1049
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:08,390
- You're not going to kill me, I know.
- No.

1050
01:26:08,467 --> 01:26:11,061
So you want to kill all these people?

1051
01:26:11,136 --> 01:26:12,967
No.

1052
01:26:13,038 --> 01:26:16,064
So who do you want to kill?
What are you doing this for?

1053
01:26:19,111 --> 01:26:21,045
For my father.

1054
01:26:21,113 --> 01:26:23,604
It won't help him.
It will kill him too.

1055
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:28,282
Look at me. Look at me.

1056
01:26:28,353 --> 01:26:31,186
You're getting by.
You're okay. You're alive.

1057
01:26:31,256 --> 01:26:34,851
I'm not alive.
I'm dead.

1058
01:26:34,927 --> 01:26:37,521
Yakir would do
the same for you.

1059
01:26:40,832 --> 01:26:43,392
Tarek, when good people die

1060
01:26:43,468 --> 01:26:45,459
they kill a lot of people
around them.

1061
01:26:45,537 --> 01:26:47,801
The suspect has something under
his shirt. Permission to open fire?

1062
01:26:47,873 --> 01:26:49,636
I repeat, permission to open fire?

1063
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:53,144
Why are you doing this?
It won't help him. It'll just kill him.

1064
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:56,977
Look, we'll get out of this.
Your father will too. Trust me.

1065
01:26:57,049 --> 01:27:01,918
You know, I had a neighbor
in Romania... Mrs. Popescu.

1066
01:27:01,987 --> 01:27:05,320
They said she never
got out of bed in 60 years.

1067
01:27:06,825 --> 01:27:09,453
- 66.
- What?

1068
01:27:09,528 --> 01:27:14,022
- 66 years.
- Yes yes.

1069
01:27:14,099 --> 01:27:16,397
Nothing happened.

1070
01:27:16,468 --> 01:27:18,732
He has something
under his shirt.

1071
01:27:18,804 --> 01:27:20,533
He's moving his hand
to his sleeve.

1072
01:27:20,605 --> 01:27:22,698
Asking again,
permission to fire?

1073
01:27:22,774 --> 01:27:25,368
- Come on, kid. Let's go home.
- Permission to fire.

1074
01:27:28,113 --> 01:27:32,982
What's this?
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1075
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:36,782
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

1076
01:28:11,423 --> 01:28:14,551
A suicide bomber at the entrance
to the Carmel market.

1077
01:28:14,626 --> 01:28:18,221
With us is Chief Inspector Shmulik
Dotan, Central District commissioner.

1078
01:28:18,296 --> 01:28:21,629
Chief Inspector Dotan,
we were very lucky today,

1079
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:23,759
if one may call it luck.

1080
01:28:23,835 --> 01:28:25,826
We're still investigating
the incident.

1081
01:28:25,904 --> 01:28:28,338
We'll have answers later.

1082
01:28:28,407 --> 01:28:30,398
Meanwhile,
what we do know...

1083
01:28:30,475 --> 01:28:33,239
this morning at 8:00
a suicide bomber was shot

1084
01:28:33,311 --> 01:28:35,245
before he managed
to detonate his charge.

1085
01:28:35,313 --> 01:28:38,407
Apparently one of the bullets
blew up the belt he was wearing.

1086
01:28:38,483 --> 01:28:40,474
For reasons we don't know yet,

1087
01:28:40,552 --> 01:28:43,385
there were no shrapnel injuries,
as we usually see,

1088
01:28:43,455 --> 01:28:45,753
but only victims
of shock and trauma.
