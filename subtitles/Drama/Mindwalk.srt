1
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,714
Hello?

2
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:21,544
Hello, Tom?

3
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:27,376
Jack? Jack, it's... What, is there
a red alert on or something?

4
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,744
Am I calling too late?

5
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:33,368
No, no... It's just that the hours
are later here...

6
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:37,665
Are you O.K.?
Is everything all right?

7
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:39,601
Not really.

8
00:01:39,785 --> 00:01:42,450
I need some help.

9
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:47,371
You think a speechwriter's going to fix it?
Do you think that's the only problem?

10
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,042
If I did, would I be calling you?

11
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:57,915
I'm sorry I missed your presidential
campaign. I just thought it was nuts.

12
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:00,562
It looks like the voters agreed with you.

13
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:06,410
Maybe it was crazy, anyway,
I'm supposed to be running again...

14
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:11,235
<i>for the re-election to the Senate,
and people aren't giving any more.</i>

15
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:14,098
Now, they are giving, but maybe
I just don't want the money.

16
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:19,708
I don't have anything to say.
I feel tapped out.

17
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:24,354
Get away from there, it's a snake pit.
It's a hall of mirrors for narcissists.

18
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:26,218
Get a long way away.

19
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:29,259
Oh, I wish, but it's impossible right now.

20
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:32,409
No, come on. It's always like that.
That's always part of the problem.

21
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,301
Are you offering me a place?

22
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:37,956
Yeah, sure. You could come
over here. Come on over.

23
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,550
It may not be the White House but, you
know, at least here you're wanted.

24
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,686
<i>I'm so glad I came here.</i>

25
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:53,036
<i>I should not have invited him.</i>

26
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,262
Incredible!

27
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,383
Look, there it is again.

28
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:13,192
The Middle Ages got left behind on
this rock. Time just moved on.

29
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:16,464
<i>There he goes again.
That's him all right.</i>

30
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,892
<i>Always enthused and always ready,
with the right words for all occasions.</i>

31
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:24,430
<i>As if everyone was
still waiting for his opinion.</i>

32
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:27,469
<i>As if life itself was one
giant press conference.</i>

33
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:36,448
<i>Maybe that's all there is,
this public persona.</i>

34
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:40,617
<i>Maybe I've been fooling myself
these last 20 years...</i>

35
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,352
<i>always looking for the real guy
behind the facade.</i>

36
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:49,298
<i>Maybe the facade is the real guy.</i>

37
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:52,410
This is amazing!

38
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:56,594
<i>Sure it is.
Everything's always amazing to this guy.</i>

39
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:58,890
<i>Why am I bitching all the time?</i>

40
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,541
<i>Maybe it's a premonition that
this trip's going to be a disaster.</i>

41
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:03,846
<i>I can't say that I need Jack's company.
This time of my life I'm residing quite...</i>

42
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,434
<i>contentedly in my own midlife crises,
thank you very much.</i>

43
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:15,406
This is as far away from Washington
as I could possibly get.

44
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,955
Thank you.

45
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,939
<i>There he goes.</i>

46
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:25,652
<i>That's why he irritates me,
and that's why I love him, too.</i>

47
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:29,498
<i>Behind the innocence there may be a
calculating politician...</i>

48
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:32,109
<i>but behind the politician
there's an innocent.</i>

49
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:36,373
<i>He's still american enough.
He doesn't lie well at all, he means it.</i>

50
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,517
You want to stop the car and get out?
Take a look around?

51
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,909
There it is.
Mont-Saint-Michel.

52
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:58,998
What do you think?

53
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:00,819
Beautiful.

54
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,890
You want to do something different?
You want to walk over there?

55
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,051
Walk across that swamp?

56
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:13,179
Yeah, just like our ancestors did
centuries and centuries ago.

57
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:16,907
You're the one who wanted to do all
the walking. Come on, let's go.

58
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:22,853
Maybe you ancestors used to do this...

59
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,694
but unless my mother
lied to me, I don't...

60
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:38,327
Thank you.

61
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,517
- So, we're gonna do something today?
- Thought I'd finish my book.

62
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:56,957
You always have a book to read.
I'm bored.

63
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,760
Where's Roman?

64
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:02,520
I don't care what Roman's doing.
I wanted to do something with you.

65
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:09,408
I should not have come. I should've
just done something with dad.

66
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,704
Come on, Kit.

67
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:15,039
You just stay cooped up in this medieval
island, just reading your books.

68
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,177
You're not even aware of
what's going on around you.

69
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:21,194
You could be anywhere, it wouldn't
even make a difference.

70
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:23,571
You should go out more.
Meet some people.

71
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:25,337
I will.

72
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:27,951
I'm going.

73
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:31,173
Bye.

74
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,268
Are you moving to France permanently?

75
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:47,381
What?

76
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:50,141
I thought you couldn't live
anywhere but in New York.

77
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,403
What about the theater?
Did you give that up for good?

78
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,842
Oh, it may have given me up for good.

79
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:06,710
I don't think I'm enough involved in
real estate to live in Manhattan...

80
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:08,846
or any other business.
Some other hustle.

81
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:13,044
I lived in New York when I was young inside.
My friends and I were more interested...

82
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:15,093
in our work
than our investments.

83
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:17,101
We weren't invidious.
We were nurturing.

84
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:22,364
And then, you know.
Alimony, the IRS...

85
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:26,453
being denied the right to parent
my own child custody--

86
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:30,509
They brought reality in,
and hey, who needs it?

87
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:35,285
When Nixon got on that chopper in 1972
I think the fight went out of all of us.

88
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,318
The big business took
over and set the agenda.

89
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,034
Boy, when you buy into big business,
when you buy into that, man...

90
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:47,650
you got to emancipate
yourself from your morals...

91
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,387
or you live a life of squeamishness.

92
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:53,341
Is this our same old argument?
I lost my morals, did I?

93
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:57,799
Automatically, by going to work
and staying inside the system?

94
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:00,936
You're taking me a little personally.
I was talking about myself.

95
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,257
I was saying that I got a little
squeamish, you know?

96
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:08,169
I know people that work a lot crasser
jobs than you, and they're happy.

97
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:10,721
They're happy, they're healthy,
they're not depressed.

98
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:13,594
They enjoy the material blessings.
Me? I couldn't handle it.

99
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:15,245
I couldn't stand it.
I just couldn't...

100
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:21,240
Confucius say "Of the 39 steps of escape
the best one's flight." So I fled.

101
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:24,767
Here I am in France where
I can pull down my pants.

102
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:30,086
I'm enough of a retarded romantic to believe
France is still a place to go and think.

103
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:36,064
So I'll stay, I guess...
or I won't. We'll see.

104
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,047
This place is like a fairy tale.

105
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:45,552
How did we wind up here?

106
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:49,584
I'll bet there's some secret
plan of yours behind all this.

107
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:54,761
I bet I could say the same thing about you.
No, I just thought you'd like to come here.

108
00:10:54,848 --> 00:11:00,304
To discover that precious quality that the
world so desperately lacks.

109
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,889
Ah, yeah. Vision.

110
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:09,089
Perspective.
Perspective, Jack.

111
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:15,294
This is where the dead are placed, in the
middle of town among the houses.

112
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:20,515
Death is a part of life, not separate from it.

113
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:26,271
There aren't enough graves for all the
generations of Mont-Saint-Michelains.

114
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:32,263
So every decade or so, the bones are
dug up so new bodies can be buried here.

115
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:36,878
And since they believed you will need
your bones again on Judgment day...

116
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,314
they placed them nearby
in the charnel house--

117
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:43,131
- Ucch! That's disgusting.
- I like cemeteries.

118
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:47,163
And in the back there, in the
church, there is a relic of a saint.

119
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:49,046
What's a relic?

120
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:55,611
Oh, maybe a shaving of the saint's
fingernail, or a scrap of the saint's robe.

121
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:58,244
Tell me Jack, how do you expect
to govern these people?

122
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,011
That's a good question.

123
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:04,789
There was an italian premier
once, just before Mussolini...

124
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:07,628
somebody asked him if it
was difficult to govern italians.

125
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:13,317
He said: "Difficult to govern italians?
No, not difficult. Only useless"

126
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:17,054
You didn't say that on the 6:00 news.

127
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:23,782
No, but I thought it night and day.
Maybe that's why I lost.

128
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,606
Anyway, did they really think that their
bones would keep until judgment day?

129
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:32,039
You got to remember for them
Judgment day was...

130
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,102
right around the corner.
They expected it almost hourly.

131
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:35,566
Just like us.

132
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:38,075
I wouldn't say so. Judgment day,
for us is different.

133
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:44,188
It's an interruption, a violation,
a break in our concept of time--

134
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:48,215
The bomb, the big one. Judgment day
for them was the ultimate day off.

135
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:49,761
Not the ultimate off day.

136
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:56,408
There wasn't mechanical time, time was
season to season, Sabbath to saint day.

137
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:01,412
And everything led toward Judgment day.
That was the reason everybody was alive.

138
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:07,952
It was the day of deliverance. Like sunday,
when you get the Times delivered.

139
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:09,818
Time was sacred.

140
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,170
They'd ring a bell in the morning,
they'd ring a bell in the evening...

141
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,650
and those moments would
change a little. But the...

142
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,479
rhythm of their era was
so different from ours...

143
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,926
that I don't think we
can even imagine it.

144
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:34,459
I guess we're a little early.

145
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:42,835
No saint stands alone.

146
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:44,220
What?

147
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:48,356
No saint stands alone.

148
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:54,284
Every time I come here, these lines
comes to me, God knows from where.

149
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:58,444
Sometimes it takes me weeks, even
years to figure out what they mean.

150
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:02,125
Did you ever read any
of the books I sent you?

151
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:07,381
No, not since you stopped thinking
about helping me with speeches.

152
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:11,117
Did you ever read the
speeches I sent you?

153
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:14,838
I tried. I mean, the old attention span,
isn't what it used to be.

154
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,566
That's true. Mine neither.

155
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:22,094
I don't have any attention anymore
for anything that's not specific.

156
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,492
Poetry just confuses me.

157
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:28,332
Yeah, politics--
Politics confuses everybody.

158
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:31,487
Including its practitioners.

159
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,511
But I know what
"No saint stands alone" means.

160
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,759
Oh, yeah? What?

161
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:40,135
It's the essence of my profession.

162
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:45,183
Because between every politician
and his own point of view...

163
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:49,806
there's always three fat cats, two
pac lobbyists, half dozen of microphones.

164
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:54,959
"No man is an island entire of itself.
Every man is a piece of the continent...

165
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:59,252
part of the main, therefore never send
to know for whom the bell tolls...

166
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,793
it tolls to thee."

167
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,783
Can't you just feel the
place watching you?

168
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:21,304
- It makes you feel pretty small.
- It was supposed to.

169
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:25,184
The individual in the human body was
supposed to feel small...

170
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,703
dwarfed, denied all independent existence.

171
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:36,929
We lost some of the sense of being
all one, but we got our freedom.

172
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,176
That's not a bad trade-off.

173
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:44,261
I don't know. I still don't know if we
haven't lost more than we've gained.

174
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:47,157
All I ever hear anybody
talk about today is themselves.

175
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:52,782
I wrote a poem once. It's titled
"The Stones Speak, I am Silent"

176
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:57,350
At least you're free to think what
you want and do what you can about it.

177
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:01,285
Think of the guy who had to carry these
stones up the hell to built this place.

178
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:05,438
He didn't have any say in life,
or try running for office some day.

179
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:10,070
Someone else sets the agenda,
someone else sets the schedule.

180
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:13,541
Somebody else decides what you can
say and what you better not say.

181
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:19,422
Talk about losing yourself. People have
been known to forget their own names.

182
00:16:20,415 --> 00:16:22,141
Maybe you're too smart to be president.

183
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,013
A television correspondent
told me that once.

184
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:26,372
What did you say?

185
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,869
I got a little steamed.

186
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,638
I said american voters want their
leaders to be dumber than they are.

187
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:38,949
They figure they'll do less harm that way.
That is an expensive form of cynicism.

188
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:41,807
- You said that on TV?
- Yup.

189
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:45,182
Maybe you're not so smart after all.

190
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,897
We go through here.

191
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:59,225
What's up here?

192
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,106
After you.

193
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:19,383
Look at this.
Look at this!

194
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:22,048
This thing has been functioning
for hundreds of years--

195
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,152
since before the
beginning of modern times.

196
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:27,497
But this is different from the kind
of time you were talking about before.

197
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:30,617
Sunrise to Sunset,
Sabbath to Sabbath, isn't it?

198
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:34,593
This is... mechanical time.

199
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,417
You bet, you bet it is.

200
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:39,689
I sometimes think that this clock,
this machine is what...

201
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,802
...constitutes humanity's first real
break from the world of nature.

202
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:46,699
Wouldn't you say so?
Hello?

203
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:50,890
The clock did much more than that.
It became the model of the cosmos.

204
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:53,707
And then they mistook the
model for the real thing.

205
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:57,551
People got the idea that
nature was just a giant clock.

206
00:17:57,696 --> 00:18:00,451
Not a living organism, but a machine.

207
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:05,223
That's exactly what I've been trying to
tell this lunkhead, exactly, word for word.

208
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:07,806
- What?
- Maybe you recognize him. Jack Edwards.

209
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,545
And you are...?

210
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,900
Sonia Hoffman.
I think I've heard your name somewhere.

211
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,301
Maybe in a couple of
hundred news broadcasts.

212
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:20,052
He was a candidate for the U.S.
presidency in the primaries.

213
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:24,348
I vaguely remember.
See? I'm not a voter.

214
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:26,909
Most americans don't vote either.

215
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,601
I do know who you are.

216
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:31,914
Me? You know who I am?
I doubt it...

217
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:34,491
You're Thomas Harriman, the poet.

218
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:39,507
Yes I am. But wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

219
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:43,382
You recognize me, a poet whose latest
work sold only 12,000 copies but you...

220
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:49,389
do not recognize this gentleman, who
was a presidential candidate in America?

221
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:52,694
My god, woman. What's happened to
your values? What do you do?

222
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:54,589
I'm a scientist.

223
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:57,494
And we do occasionally read poetry.

224
00:18:57,614 --> 00:19:00,167
As a matter of fact, I'm doing
a lot of it these days.

225
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,959
I'm on a sort of sabbatical.

226
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,959
I'm an ex-physicist,
an ex-american resident...

227
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,783
- an ex-voter--
- Ex-wife?

228
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:15,422
This is very upsetting. Why don't intelligent
people like yourself bother to vote?

229
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:19,447
Forgive me. You politicians make it so hard.

230
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:23,878
The ideas expressed by
most of you, right or left...

231
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:27,174
seem to me as antique and
mechanical as that old clock.

232
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:28,710
What's that supposed to mean?

233
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:34,558
If I was to explain that, I'd have to
go all the way back to Descartes...

234
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:36,934
if you remember him.

235
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,750
- Yeah
- "To be or not to be"

236
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:44,730
- "I Think, therefore, I am."
- Yeah, well. We both went to college.

237
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:50,720
Descartes was the primary architect of
the view that sees the world as a clock.

238
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:55,028
A mechanistic view that still
dominates most of the world today...

239
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:58,500
and it seems to me
specially you politicians.

240
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:04,124
Mechanistic?
Is that a real word?

241
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:09,861
Mechanistic, mechanical, mechanics.
Yeah, it's a good word.

242
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:14,037
Mechanistic.
As if Nature functioned like a clock.

243
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:19,076
You take it a part, reduce it to a number of
small, simple pieces, easy to understand...

244
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:23,013
analyze them, put them all back together
and then you understand the whole.

245
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:26,470
Isn't that what's known as scientific
thinking, Miss Hoffman?

246
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:30,696
What you call the mechanistic view isn't
that what the scientific method's all about?

247
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,839
Is it?

248
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:38,016
I don't think so. But I'd like to kind
to hear from the physicist, Jack.

249
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,286
All right, I'm sorry.
Please continue.

250
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:44,422
Well, you're right in a way, Mr...

251
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:46,134
Jack, call me Jack.

252
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:49,022
O.K., Jack.
You're right in a sense.

253
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:52,399
But it wasn't always so,
not before Descartes.

254
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:55,170
When he introduced such thinking...

255
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,514
it amounted to a revolutionary
break with the church.

256
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,263
He said "I don't need the Pope to
tell me how the world functions...

257
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:07,367
I can find that out for myself,
because to me the world is just a machine."

258
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:11,854
And then he became fascinated
with clockworks...

259
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:14,213
and made the clock into
his central metaphor.

260
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:21,801
He said "I consider the human body
as nothing but a machine...

261
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:29,592
A healthy man is like a well-made clock.
A sick man is like an ill-made clock."

262
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:33,866
The metaphor seems a little clumsy now.
But it worked, didn't it?

263
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:38,849
Yes, so successfully, that
scientists came to believe...

264
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:44,585
that all living things, plants
animals, us, are nothig but machines.

265
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:49,316
And that's the fallacy. It carried
over into everything, arts, politics...

266
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:52,937
I don’t know, it seems to me
that most people don't...

267
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:55,080
even remember
who Descartes was.

268
00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:59,503
- I'm sorry, I guess I just don't follow you.
- But he'd like to.

269
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,286
If you could break it down into 30-second
media bites, that's what he's used to.

270
00:22:05,863 --> 00:22:07,279
Very funny.

271
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:13,554
What is it that I don't recognize?
What's so bad about Descartes?

272
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:18,697
But there's nothing bad about Descartes.
In fact, I think Descartes is wonderful.

273
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:24,147
He was a godsend to the 17th century.
But times have changed since then.

274
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,404
We need a new way
of understanding life.

275
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:36,028
That pendulum for example, has long since
been replaced by a tiny quartz crystal.

276
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:40,005
And these magnificent
hand-forged wheels...

277
00:22:40,165 --> 00:22:44,302
turned into microchip
the size of my thumbnail.

278
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:49,805
That's how far modern science has
left mechanistic thinking behind.

279
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:58,502
But you politicians seem to have
that clockwork still ticking in your head.

280
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,207
Keep on going, Sonia. Don't stop.

281
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,722
Who knows? You may have that vital
piece of information we pols...

282
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:18,820
venal and stupid as we are have
been missing out on all along.

283
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,982
There you go, thinking
in terms of pieces.

284
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:24,820
Pieces are all we get of the
picture, only fragments.

285
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:27,316
Come on, give some examples.

286
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:33,885
Well, let's take the population
problem for example.

287
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:40,246
You can't solve it by looking at different
forms of birth control in isolation.

288
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:45,051
Research has proven that the
most effective form of birth control...

289
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:48,363
is not a pill, it's economic
and social gains...

290
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,374
which will reduce the
desire for large families.

291
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:52,556
That's true.

292
00:23:52,867 --> 00:24:00,179
Did you know that in our world
every day 40,000 children die...

293
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:03,715
from malnutrition and
preventable diseases?

294
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:07,148
That's every other second.

295
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:08,893
That's now...

296
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:12,534
and now... and now...

297
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:19,494
But the short lives of these children
cannot be seen in isolation...

298
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:23,869
they're part of the whole system,
involving the economics...

299
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:26,540
involving the environment,
and more specifically...

300
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:30,342
- involving high levels of third-world debt.
- How's that?

301
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,718
The burden of frenzied borrowing is not
falling on those with foreign banks...

302
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:37,806
...accounts, nor on those
who created the imbalance.

303
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,198
The burden's falling on
the already deprived.

304
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:44,501
Three years ago, president
Nyerere asked the question:

305
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:48,167
"Must we starve our
children to pay our debts?"

306
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:51,504
That question has been
answered in practice...

307
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:53,183
...and the answer has been YES...

308
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:56,919
...because since he asked, hundreds
and thousands of little children...

309
00:24:57,033 --> 00:25:01,207
...in the third world have given their
lives to pay their country's debts.

310
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:06,816
And millions more are still paying interest
with their malnourished minds and bodies.

311
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:13,816
Take Brazil.

312
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,329
Do you know that they are destroying
their Amazon rain forests...

313
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:21,041
...at the rate of one football
field a second?

314
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:23,713
Now, now, now.

315
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:29,898
Why? They're trying to pay their national
debt with cattle and land speculation.

316
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,391
They don't even have
time to sell the timber...

317
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,479
...so they're setting
fire to the woods.

318
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:39,522
And our barren forests are one of the
main causes of the global warming...

319
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:41,634
...the green house effect.

320
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:45,307
And in the meantime, we are pouring
our money into the arms race.

321
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:50,299
You cannot look at one single of our
global problems in isolation...

322
00:25:50,363 --> 00:25:52,691
...trying to understand it and solve it.

323
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:58,552
You can fix a fragment of a piece,
but it will deteriorate a second later...

324
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:01,241
because what it was
connected to has been ignored.

325
00:26:01,904 --> 00:26:06,148
We have to change everything
together at the same time.

326
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:13,006
- The ideals, the institutions, the values--
- All of this sounds kind of familiar.

327
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:16,527
Do you two know each other?
Is this a setup?

328
00:26:17,063 --> 00:26:19,741
Well, all right.
What do I think about this?

329
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:23,587
The problems are complex but you're
looking at the dark side, because us...

330
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:28,290
...are capacity to response, isn't it?
Communications, databanks, technology--

331
00:26:28,362 --> 00:26:31,435
We already have the tools to deal
with a lot of these problems...

332
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:36,085
- ...even if they are more complex.
- Candide himself, the eternal optimist.

333
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,463
But don't you see?
There are all these new technologies...

334
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,495
...they're causing more
problems that they solve.

335
00:26:42,662 --> 00:26:46,812
In medicine for example, there's been
an overwhelming increase in technology...

336
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:49,775
...but the costs have spiraled concurrently.

337
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,516
It's become medicine for the rich and public
health hasn't improved significantly...

338
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,697
...although public health would
improve dramatically if we...

339
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:00,258
...just changed our eating
habits, for example.

340
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,619
But instead the experts are occupied
with making artificial hearts.

341
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:10,686
If our agribusiness had fed us better
instead of chopping down the rain forests...

342
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,101
...in order to make cattle ranches in order
to produce more and more red meat...

343
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,781
...which is one of the direct
causes of heart attacks...

344
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:21,810
...then maybe we would not have to spend 
so much of our money on artificial hearts...

345
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:26,150
...and so on, and so on. This is all
examples of interconnectedness.

346
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:30,833
But, Sonia... All right
supposing that you're right...

347
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:33,929
...and everything's connected
to everything else as you say...

348
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,348
...still you've got to start
somewhere, don't you?

349
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:39,565
That's the real political question here.
Where do you start?

350
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,232
By changing the way
we're seeing the world.

351
00:27:43,296 --> 00:27:47,738
You're still searching for the
right piece to fix first.

352
00:27:47,817 --> 00:27:54,699
You don't see that all the problems
simply are fragments of one single crisis.

353
00:27:54,772 --> 00:27:58,284
- A crisis of perception.
- Oh, good.

354
00:27:58,356 --> 00:28:01,748
The world's coming to an end and you
say it's a crisis of perception.

355
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,836
I'm sorry, that's a
little abstract for me.

356
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:08,174
And all this stuff about modern
medicine, all your criticisms...

357
00:28:08,262 --> 00:28:12,270
I may be a doctor's son,
but you have to admit that...

358
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:15,045
...this mechanistic medicine
has been pretty successful.

359
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:18,341
Well... up to a point.

360
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:22,694
But simply by blocking the
mechanisms of a disease...

361
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:24,471
...doesn't mean healing it.

362
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,741
I mean, it's like in politics, it's just
shifting the problem to another sphere.

363
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:33,287
Are you going to leave me stranded
out here in this argument by myself?

364
00:28:33,383 --> 00:28:37,079
I'm going to leave you stranded.

365
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:44,695
O.K... A person goes to a
doctor today with recurring...

366
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:48,162
...attacks of gallstones and the
doctor takes the gallbladder out.

367
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,070
And low and behold
the pain goes away.

368
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,191
You could say the doctor's working from
a poor perceptual model, that he just...

369
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:58,566
...concentrated on a part of the clock
that wasn't working and removed it.

370
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:01,318
But the fact is the patient
is out of his pain.

371
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,341
He's feeling better and
the clock is ticking again.

372
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,534
His perceptual model worked.

373
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:09,516
But is everything that works
good for the system?

374
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:13,278
That's disingenuous and not
useful when applied to politics...

375
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:16,463
...which is, after all, a system
that is based on people.

376
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,014
It's the art of bringing people to agree
on a certain course of action.

377
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:23,703
If that course of action succeeds,
the people are satisfied...

378
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,414
...if not, they're not.

379
00:29:25,478 --> 00:29:27,719
It's as simple as that.
If it works, it's good.

380
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:31,519
Isn't that what you said why
politics doesn't work...

381
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:35,630
...that politics needed to become
the art of the impossible?

382
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,399
Whose side are you on?

383
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:42,463
Hers, obviously.
She's intelligent, gracious...

384
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,664
...and she's more attractive.

385
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:50,847
Listen, Jack. I'd like to get
back to the systems.

386
00:29:50,928 --> 00:29:53,483
-You know, you called me dishonest.
-Oh, no, no, no...

387
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:55,723
Let's talk about the gallbladder again.

388
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:59,124
Let's say the gallbladder's out
and the pain is gone...

389
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:02,407
...but what about the stress that
might have caused the illness?

390
00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:06,817
If that stress persists he's probably
going to get sick again.

391
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,825
Or let's say he had
changed his nutrition...

392
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:12,761
...much earlier, and
done some exercise.

393
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:15,475
He may never have developed
the gallstones in the first place.

394
00:30:15,545 --> 00:30:18,451
A little health education
might have been...

395
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:21,587
...much cheaper that the operation,
a lot less painful, too.

396
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:25,275
But our system doesn't
encourage prevention...

397
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:27,331
...it encourages intervention.

398
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:30,636
O.K. You're not disingenuous, but to
blame all this on french philosopher...

399
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:33,580
...who's been dead 300 years, isn't
that a little out of proportion...

400
00:30:33,676 --> 00:30:36,508
...maybe even all a little eccentric?

401
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:40,074
No. Not if I'm right.

402
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:43,524
See, my point isn't to
condemn Descartes' thinking.

403
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:46,555
It's simply to recognize its limitations.

404
00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:50,455
It might have been extremely
useful to perceive the world...

405
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:53,971
...as a machine for 300 years
but that perception today...

406
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,635
...is not only inaccurate,
it's actually harmful.

407
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:02,236
We need a new vision of the world.

408
00:31:02,836 --> 00:31:04,661
What's that quotation?

409
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:10,429
"It's foolish for a society to try to
cling to its old ideas in new times...

410
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:14,078
...just as it's foolish for a grown
man to try to squeeze...

411
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:17,933
...into the coat that fit him in his youth."
Something like that...

412
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:19,409
Thomas Jefferson.

413
00:31:20,786 --> 00:31:22,641
Maybe you're not crazy.

414
00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:32,557
I don't know, Sonia. This new
vision of the world might just be...

415
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:37,604
...some sort of millennium madness
as we approach the year 2000.

416
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:39,588
Oh, everybody's aware now.

417
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,331
We can make ourselves extinct
at the press of a button.

418
00:31:43,074 --> 00:31:46,124
We're soiling every square
foot of land, sea and air.

419
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:49,251
That water looks clean
but it's not, is it?

420
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:51,050
Nothing is.

421
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:55,587
The English Channel is one of the most
polluted bodies of water in the world...

422
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:58,179
...and the oysters around here are famous.

423
00:31:58,404 --> 00:32:01,012
Soon they'll be unsafe to eat.

424
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:04,764
Not only that. This water is radioactive...

425
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:08,348
...contaminated by a nuclear
plant a few miles from here.

426
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:10,378
Yeah, I read about that too.

427
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:14,027
Politicians can read.
We know all about these things.

428
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:16,188
Some of us think about
them every day. I do.

429
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:19,110
But we have to deal with a
different set of constraints...

430
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:22,807
...different kinds of interdependence
that those you discuss.

431
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:26,246
Let's say it turns out to be true,
that what you say is true.

432
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:30,109
Cattle are brutally treated,
loaded with chemicals...

433
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:32,311
...too much red meat is bad for you...

434
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:34,279
...and the landscape's
being wrecked by overgrazing.

435
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,887
Let's say all that's turn to be true.

436
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,615
So for health and a hundred
other reasons, I help enact a tax...

437
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:44,848
...on the consumption of red meat,
the way we tax tobacco...

438
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:47,216
...to making people think twice
about that kind of consumption.

439
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,839
What a wonderful idea!

440
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,433
We could do cancer and heart
research for the revenue.

441
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:56,234
And I have 50 lobbyists
pounding on my door...

442
00:32:56,338 --> 00:32:58,738
...while a hundred different
meat producers political action...

443
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:01,858
...committees poured money
into my opponent's campaign...

444
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:05,338
...and my switchboard was lit up
all day with calls from senators...

445
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:08,106
...and representatives and governors
of all the meat-producing states.

446
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:12,411
But O.K., Sonia, just for you,
let's say I take all that on.

447
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:16,515
As Sam Rayburn said "Every once
in a while a man ought to do...

448
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,444
...something just because it's right."

449
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:22,179
But if on top of that, I come out
against a few weapons programs...

450
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:25,739
...and try to do something about acid
rain and sponsor a bill supporting...

451
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:29,931
...increased funding for solar energy,
you know what?

452
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:33,788
By the next election anybody
who would run against me...

453
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:37,206
...and I mean anybody, would have the
combined funds of all those people...

454
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:39,736
...to defeat me, and he would too.

455
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:43,047
Because when you're that
far ahead of public opinion...

456
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:45,102
...that's the way they let you know.

457
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,774
I do what everybody else does, from the
lowliest congressman to the president...

458
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,991
...I pick a few crucial issues that I
think are crucial, a part of your whole...

459
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:59,744
...and I persist until I get
somewhere if I'm lucky.

460
00:34:01,864 --> 00:34:03,975
For the rest, I mark time, I wait.

461
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:08,103
I go along, I... I trade off.

462
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:14,151
This is why I don't vote.
It's what we've been talking about.

463
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:18,080
You get people to eat less red meat,
and then you do something like...

464
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:22,160
...paying off the farmers, buying up
surplus butter and subsidizing its price.

465
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:25,626
If we don't get a heart attack
one way, you'll find another way.

466
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:29,710
Well, I agree with you.
We wouldn't contradict ourselves...

467
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:32,711
...so much if we didn't
do things piecemeal.

468
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:37,319
But you know, there's something a
little scary, maybe something...

469
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:41,223
...even a little cruel about
your theoretical exigency.

470
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:46,022
I mean, are you going to be the one who
tells everyone what's good for them?

471
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:48,614
Are you gonna tell the farmer
something's wrong with the goals his...

472
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:52,279
...family has pursued for generations
then just shut them down?

473
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:55,894
Maybe we're beaten up all
day by private interests...

474
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:59,544
...but at least our government
now stays close to what people...

475
00:34:59,623 --> 00:35:02,383
...perceive to be their needs.

476
00:35:02,455 --> 00:35:06,879
Look, the world changes faster
than people's perception of it.

477
00:35:06,992 --> 00:35:10,167
Wouldn't be challenge for a
great political leader to bridge...

478
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,727
...the gap, to inform, to allow
us to feel responsibility?

479
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:19,247
Anyway, the people don't
trust you politicians anymore.

480
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:23,408
At your last election only 50%
of them even bothered to vote.

481
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,039
Getting them back would really
require a politics of the impossible.

482
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:30,698
What a great campaign slogan.
Where were you when I needed you?

483
00:35:31,186 --> 00:35:32,409
I'd vote for it.

484
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,840
Oh, good. I'd get the poet vote.

485
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:38,840
Politics of the impossible.
You might get my vote too.

486
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,056
Oh, great! Add to that the
support of all well-informed...

487
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:46,077
...but nonparticipating-women
living on medieval islands.

488
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:48,308
That's no victory.

489
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:14,178
Why does that make me angry?

490
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:17,538
Probably because they don't
want have anything to do with us.

491
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:19,202
They don't believe in us.

492
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,287
There isn't any reason they should,
except their own eventual aging.

493
00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:25,402
They don't even notice where they are.

494
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:31,579
They think this is the movies, but
this room is absolutely contemporary.

495
00:36:32,531 --> 00:36:36,427
Everybody's got a torture chamber now.
They don't even notice them.

496
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:41,579
Are you going to say this is part
of your crisis of perception, too?

497
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:53,341
Maybe we're all led a little towards
death, like wolves to the weak.

498
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:57,348
Or maybe people are just shits, hmm?

499
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:01,331
You'd like blame this on Descartes.
I'd like blame it on anybody.

500
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:03,332
But it's such a part of human history, I...

501
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:09,189
Well, I don't know about Descartes,
but I know Francis Bacon presided...

502
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:13,392
...over the witch trials of king James I
at a time when millions of women were...

503
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,784
...tortured or burned for practicing
folk medicine or worshiping...

504
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:21,634
...pre-Christian goddesses or simply
because they were unusual.

505
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:24,494
I would probably have ended
up on the stake myself.

506
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:29,138
I don't believe it was a metaphor
when Francis Bacon wrote...

507
00:37:29,218 --> 00:37:31,677
...that Nature had to be
hounded in her wandering...

508
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:35,058
...bound into service, made a slave.

509
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:40,387
He even said that scientists with
their new mechanical devices...

510
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:43,899
...had to torture Nature's
secrets out of her.

511
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:48,755
Did you notice how he uses "her"
when describing Mother Nature?

512
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:51,970
As if Nature was nothing but a witch?

513
00:37:57,379 --> 00:38:04,674
Yes. It's actually fair to
say that this room...

514
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:08,800
...represents a crisis of perception.

515
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,485
But this room was here for a long
time before Descartes and Bacon.

516
00:38:15,398 --> 00:38:18,870
Violence goes on no matter how mankind
understands the world, doesn't it?

517
00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:23,190
An exploitation... Of course, we'd all
like to think it would be different...

518
00:38:24,478 --> 00:38:26,233
...if we saw things differently.

519
00:38:26,313 --> 00:38:31,816
But hasn't modern science, technology,
business done exactly what...

520
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,092
...Francis Bacon preached:
tortured our planet?

521
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:41,278
Didn't we just implement the old
patriarchal idea about man dominating all?

522
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:45,523
I don't know, Sonia. Let me be the
devil's advocate for a minute.

523
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:48,554
How much have we really tortured
and hounded the planet?

524
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:50,731
You could say not much...

525
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:53,783
...compared to what the ice ages
did to the world, for example.

526
00:38:53,872 --> 00:38:57,134
And who says that nature can't cope?

527
00:38:57,247 --> 00:39:01,102
We're scared to death about
the disappearing ozone layer...

528
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,315
...but we only started studying
ozone levels about 10 years ago.

529
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:08,666
It could be that these so-called
holes in the atmosphere...

530
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:12,284
...have been appearing and
the disappearing again...

531
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:14,836
...since time's beginning.
Couldn't it?

532
00:39:14,908 --> 00:39:19,507
It could be that Nature has a healing
mechanism we don't even know about.

533
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:22,540
It could be this hysteria
about ultraviolet rays...

534
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:25,344
...is nothing more than that,
just hysteria.

535
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:30,419
That's what they said about the
German forests and look at them now.

536
00:39:30,475 --> 00:39:33,652
More than half the trees in the
black forest are dying.

537
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:37,453
We can't explain it away any longer.
We simply cannot take the risk.

538
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:43,845
Right here around this island the tides are
slowing down, maybe because of silt...

539
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:47,869
...building up from garbage dumped in the
bay or from the overuse of fertilizers.

540
00:39:48,628 --> 00:39:52,989
Lakes can die, entire
oceans become polluted...

541
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:57,013
...topsoil, forests, water,
poisoned, dead.

542
00:39:57,069 --> 00:40:00,894
Things can change so
fast at the hands of man.

543
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:05,603
Nature becomes fragile,
rain becomes acid.

544
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:09,148
I agree with everything you said.
But why this patriarchal fixation?

545
00:40:10,022 --> 00:40:13,802
Those women witches were
betrayed by other women.

546
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,028
Phyllis Schlafly, a woman, has
written that God's...

547
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:18,389
...greatest gift to mankind
was the atom bomb.

548
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:20,941
These are women. Why not just
say what's patriarchal...

549
00:40:20,988 --> 00:40:22,912
...is what's evil in both
men and women?

550
00:40:22,992 --> 00:40:27,411
There's plenty to go around
unless you happen to believe...

551
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:30,769
...these women were brainwashed
by men, like Patty Hearst.

552
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:32,568
Why are you so scornful?

553
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:35,753
Look, there are two great principles
functioning in this entire...

554
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,680
...living world: the male
principle, pick the adjective...

555
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,864
...aggressive, dominating, whatever;
and the female principle...

556
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:45,225
...nurturing, caretaking,
gentle, whatever...

557
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,508
What I'm saying is that these 2 principles
may have been in a rough balance.

558
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:52,323
But now the men and yes,
I do think IT IS the men...

559
00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:55,337
...have created the tools,
the weapons both intellectually...

560
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:58,673
...and physically to bring these two
principles way out of balance.

561
00:40:58,768 --> 00:41:04,626
We've been placing mechanistic tools in the
hands of power-oriented patriarchal people.

562
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:12,530
I'm saying you men are out of control now
and I, you, we... all we are the victims.

563
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:15,095
So what's the risk?

564
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:18,728
What's wrong with giving the
female principle an opportunity?

565
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,368
And I say let's get out of this room.

566
00:41:23,423 --> 00:41:26,923
It's having a torturous
effect on our relationship.

567
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:45,516
Look, Sonia. I'm sorry if I ruffled
your feathers down there.

568
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:49,677
I just, um... you know...
I'm a failed husband.

569
00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:53,733
I'm a little too sensitive
about all that stuff.

570
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:57,134
I'm also a starving poet
and a bad teacher...

571
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:01,437
...and Jack's another midlife
casualty, except his wife's...

572
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:04,477
...still around. May be there's a
connection in there somewhere for you.

573
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:08,749
What do you do? What brings
you to this remote place?

574
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:12,125
Well, let's see...

575
00:42:13,206 --> 00:42:18,726
I'm a scientist still, even though
I'm on a semi permanent sabbatical.

576
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,830
How come?

577
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:23,742
I got tired of seeing my work fed
to the U. S. Defense Department.

578
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:28,518
I'm a physicist, the only woman
in my graduate department...

579
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:35,159
...the first in Norway doing quantum
field theory. My specialty was lasers.

580
00:42:35,223 --> 00:42:39,959
At that time, the challenge was to design
lasers of ever-shorter wavelengths.

581
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,367
The shorter the wavelength,
the more powerful the laser.

582
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:47,285
Our ultimate goal was to
create an x-ray laser.

583
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:52,821
One day I hit upon an unusual
idea which, as it turned out...

584
00:42:52,885 --> 00:42:56,021
...led to a major advance
in that x-ray laser.

585
00:42:56,077 --> 00:43:00,961
Well, when you do something like that,
science treats you very well.

586
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:03,498
I got many attractive offers...

587
00:43:04,193 --> 00:43:07,705
First from Paris and then from
the States and I took them.

588
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:12,856
Finally working quite happily
in Boston until one day...

589
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:19,118
I discovered, totally unexpectedly,
that my work was being perverted.

590
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:26,312
I had always looked at the medical
applications of my work of using...

591
00:43:26,385 --> 00:43:32,827
...this laser to provide holographic
images of cells or even molecules.

592
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:38,828
It could have helped us solve so many
puzzles, even the formation of cancer cells.

593
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:44,897
But what really happened was that a more
sophisticated version of my idea was...

594
00:43:44,976 --> 00:43:49,776
...being used in the star wars
program, and it blew my mind.

595
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,561
It... it made me re-evaluate
my whole profession.

596
00:43:57,314 --> 00:43:59,578
Anyway, to cut it short...

597
00:44:00,185 --> 00:44:05,066
...in the midst of other events
I just got up and left.

598
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,705
What were the other
events, if I may ask?

599
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:10,867
Experiences not all that different
from yours, I suppose.

600
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:15,085
I left Boston and
eventually I came here.

601
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:21,780
I just came one day from Paris
and the place took hold of me.

602
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:24,317
I kept coming back.

603
00:44:24,397 --> 00:44:28,413
There were weeks when the
storms chased the tourists away...

604
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:31,675
...and I had this place all to myself.

605
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:37,787
I started to look at how my special
knowledge of subatomic physics...

606
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:40,922
...relates to the way I
perceive the world at large.

607
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:45,746
I don't know, but I think that I'll have
something to say after my time here.

608
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:50,129
I don't know yet if it will fit
into a coherent whole.

609
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:55,044
But it's what I ponder when I
take my morning walks, which...

610
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:57,601
...today, for some reason,
brought me to you two.

611
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:01,793
See, every morning, I walk
across the island regardless...

612
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:06,178
...of the weather trying to
understand its other language.

613
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,450
The stones speak, and I'm silent.

614
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:14,962
Something like that, yes.
That's from a poem, isn't it?

615
00:45:15,483 --> 00:45:20,300
Well, maybe, I don't know. Do you ever
write down any of your thoughts?

616
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:22,259
Oh, yes, all the time.

617
00:45:22,323 --> 00:45:24,931
I'd like to combine my notes
into a book and call it...

618
00:45:25,003 --> 00:45:27,987
...Ecological Thinking, as
opposed to Cartesian Thinking.

619
00:45:28,052 --> 00:45:29,736
Cartesian?

620
00:45:30,696 --> 00:45:34,283
Yeah, Descartes wrote in latin. His latin
name was Cartesius, hence Cartesian.

621
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,492
Really? I thought it meant
map-like, like a map.

622
00:45:37,564 --> 00:45:41,513
- You thought it meant like "a la carte".
- Yes, like a menu.

623
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:44,385
Then his name would
have been Menusian.

624
00:45:46,608 --> 00:45:52,547
I'd like to offer this ecological way of
thinking as a new way of looking at things.

625
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:55,731
Help us overcome this
crisis of perception.

626
00:45:56,275 --> 00:46:01,047
See, what I've found here is that
to think in an ecological way...

627
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:03,066
...simply makes more sense of everything.

628
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,779
It gives me a much firmer grasp
of reality. It gives me strength.

629
00:46:08,275 --> 00:46:10,138
Knowledge is power?

630
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:14,704
Yes, but in the sense of
personal empowerment.

631
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:18,025
Not that old male urge
for power over others.

632
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:20,544
Descartes' evil empire again?

633
00:46:21,854 --> 00:46:23,465
Descartes had a dream.

634
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:26,923
It was really Isaac Newton who
made that dream come true.

635
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:31,684
Who transformed it into
scientific theory, into power.

636
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:36,007
"May God us keep from single vision
and Newton's sleep." William Blake.

637
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:39,376
- I'm very impressed.
- You two would have a lot in common.

638
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:43,912
He was writing in poetry 200 years ago
what you're saying today in prose.

639
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:47,033
He hated Newton's
concept of single vision.

640
00:46:47,113 --> 00:46:50,385
He dedicated his entire life to making
art that denied single vision.

641
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:54,657
Of course, the people of his
time thought he was a crank.

642
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,965
Whereas they revered
Newton almost as a god.

643
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:04,493
By reducing all physical phenomena
to the motion of material particles...

644
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:08,660
...a motion caused by the force of gravity,
he was able to describe the exact...

645
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:13,668
...effect of gravity on any object
with precise mathematical equations.

646
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:16,796
We call it Newton's laws of motion...

647
00:47:16,885 --> 00:47:21,002
...really, the great achievement
of 17th century science.

648
00:47:21,194 --> 00:47:25,514
You mean all that stuff I slept through
in high school, that square root of...

649
00:47:25,602 --> 00:47:28,369
...the hypotenuse divided
by a pinch of magnesium?

650
00:47:28,899 --> 00:47:32,388
Well, in the right hands, or
should I say, aroused minds...

651
00:47:32,465 --> 00:47:35,042
...these equations seems
to work beautifully.

652
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:48,517
I could use Newton's equations
to calculate and explain...

653
00:47:48,596 --> 00:47:53,283
...every motion of that throw, from the
ballistic curve to the ripples in the water.

654
00:47:53,348 --> 00:47:56,605
This was a feat so impressive
for the time that Newton's...

655
00:47:56,685 --> 00:47:59,685
...mathematical system
immediately established itself as...

656
00:47:59,764 --> 00:48:03,845
...The correct theory of reality,
the ultimate laws of nature.

657
00:48:03,893 --> 00:48:07,769
Descartes' dream of the world
as a perfect machine...

658
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:11,273
...was now an established fact.

659
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:16,017
It brought with it such a
wealth of benefits for people.

660
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:18,601
People could do things they
never been able to do before.

661
00:48:18,697 --> 00:48:22,063
It was irresistible, and of
course, the old notions of...

662
00:48:22,142 --> 00:48:25,381
...the world as a living
organism was swept away.

663
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:27,471
So, what's wrong with Newton?

664
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:30,406
Kit.

665
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,039
Well, this is my daughter
Kit and her friend Roman.

666
00:48:34,238 --> 00:48:36,611
Kit, this is Thomas Harriman.

667
00:48:36,677 --> 00:48:38,213
- How you do?
- And this is Jack, uh--

668
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:41,053
- Jack Edwards.
- Yeah, Jack Edwards. Hi.

669
00:48:41,676 --> 00:48:44,759
What do you think of this new
ecological view of your mother's?

670
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:46,951
It's O.K.

671
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,743
Kit is utterly bored
hearing me talk about it.

672
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:53,487
Yeah, well... We're going
to go. Nice to meet you.

673
00:48:53,592 --> 00:48:55,235
Yes, nice meeting you.

674
00:48:55,363 --> 00:48:56,899
- Have fun.
- See you later.

675
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,767
Well, so she's living here with you?

676
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,085
No, she's in her first year in
college, she's on a break.

677
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:11,957
But right now, yes, I think she's
utterly bored living here with me.

678
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:16,069
I understand that.
I have two of my own.

679
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,349
Yeah, I had--
I mean I have one.

680
00:49:22,013 --> 00:49:26,947
You know, it's no accident
that Turner painted light...

681
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:33,139
...when he did or that light became
the inspiration of the impressionists.

682
00:49:34,475 --> 00:49:39,603
The nature of light became an
obsession with the physicists, too.

683
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:46,627
See, none of them could visualize how
the light of the sun reached the earth.

684
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:51,253
Why?
What is nature of light?

685
00:49:52,317 --> 00:49:57,852
To understand the nature of light, you
have to know what matter is made of.

686
00:49:58,149 --> 00:49:59,853
I thought it was made of atoms.

687
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:05,668
What's an atom? Newton
thought it was small, solid particles.

688
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:10,451
But that's not what scientists saw when
they observed atoms for the first time.

689
00:50:10,523 --> 00:50:15,002
What they saw was totally
unexpected and shocking.

690
00:50:15,122 --> 00:50:18,543
You mean, when they discovered atoms
were made up of even smaller particles...

691
00:50:18,736 --> 00:50:21,671
...a nucleus with electrons
whirling around it?

692
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:29,521
Not only that. They were moving in
relatively vast regions of empty space.

693
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:36,805
That's what shook the scientists up.
Atoms consist mainly of empty space.

694
00:50:36,942 --> 00:50:40,160
What's that mean, vast regions of
empty space? Atoms are tiny.

695
00:50:40,263 --> 00:50:42,953
Yes, they are, this is what's
so hard to visualize.

696
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:49,249
See, the size of atoms is so far removed
from our ordinary sense of scale and...

697
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:53,185
...proportion that it's extremely hard
to get a feeling for the relative...

698
00:50:53,273 --> 00:50:57,090
...sizes and distances of their particles.

699
00:50:57,497 --> 00:51:01,178
Ask yourself, how many atoms
are there in an orange?

700
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:04,425
To answer this, you'll have to
blow up the orange to a size...

701
00:51:04,505 --> 00:51:06,241
...where you can actually see the atoms.

702
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:11,357
You'll have to blow up the orange
until it's reached the size of the earth.

703
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:17,214
The atoms inside of it will then
be the size of cherries.

704
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:24,890
Myriads of cherries tightly packed
into an orange the size of earth.

705
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:28,603
Wow, what an image!
I'm serious.

706
00:51:28,676 --> 00:51:32,660
I was trying to shrink the earth
orange back to a real orange and...

707
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:36,363
...imagine all those cherries
whizzing around, it made me dizzy.

708
00:51:36,443 --> 00:51:38,940
This is a dangerous
height to be dizzy at.

709
00:51:39,027 --> 00:51:44,475
But O.K. The atom’s the size of a
cherry and in that cherry-atom...

710
00:51:44,572 --> 00:51:46,969
...there's all of this empty space.
What about the nucleus?

711
00:51:47,075 --> 00:51:50,621
There's a nucleus, right?
How big is that?

712
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:52,885
"Invisible" is the answer.

713
00:51:52,966 --> 00:51:56,087
If we blow up the atom to
the size of a football...

714
00:51:56,088 --> 00:51:58,798
...the nucleus would still be invisible.

715
00:51:58,877 --> 00:52:02,997
If we blow it up to the size
of a sphere that fits...

716
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:06,678
...in this room, the nucleus
would still be invisible.

717
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:11,405
What about the size of this island,
the rock we're standing on?

718
00:52:11,478 --> 00:52:13,878
O.K.

719
00:52:14,014 --> 00:52:19,784
We would blow the atom, the cherry,
up to the size of this island...

720
00:52:22,408 --> 00:52:28,977
...then the nucleus would be the size
of a small pebble, something like that.

721
00:52:29,617 --> 00:52:32,393
And the electrons would
be much smaller still.

722
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:36,580
We would have to look for them
all the way down there...

723
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,224
...at the edge of the island.

724
00:52:39,754 --> 00:52:43,273
And whole space in between
would be empty.

725
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,441
- Wow, that's fantastic!
- That's weird.

726
00:52:45,514 --> 00:52:47,730
That's even weirder than poetry.

727
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:52,137
So, what you're saying is
that if there were a sphere...

728
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:54,465
...large enough to contain
this whole island...

729
00:52:54,545 --> 00:52:57,993
...it would actually consist of a
pebble and a few grains of sand?

730
00:52:58,072 --> 00:53:00,203
That's all this huge sphere contains?

731
00:53:00,371 --> 00:53:03,747
In other words, nothing?
It's empty?

732
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:11,155
But if this rock is made of spheres
like that, then what makes it so solid?

733
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,078
Why can't I pass my hand through it?

734
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:17,062
-Why don't we fall through it?
-Why don't we fall through everything?

735
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:22,901
This is the obvious question that
physicists had to ask.

736
00:53:30,694 --> 00:53:35,462
Now remember that all the newtonian
concepts were based on things...

737
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:39,471
...that could actually be seen
or at least visualized...

738
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:44,798
...but what they were now finding in
this strange and unexpected world...

739
00:53:45,966 --> 00:53:50,438
...were concepts that could
no longer be visualized.

740
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:54,272
And when they went on battling
with these absurd phenomena of...

741
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:57,095
...atomic physics, they were
forced to admit to themselves...

742
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,615
...they didn't have a language,
not even an adequate way of...

743
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,927
...thinking to describe
their new discoveries.

744
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,336
They were forced to think
in entirely new ways.

745
00:54:08,431 --> 00:54:10,872
In terms of radically new concepts.

746
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:22,001
To understand why matter is so solid they
had to question the conventional ideas...

747
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:27,337
...about the very existence of matter,
and after many frustrating years...

748
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:34,725
...they were forced to admit that
matter does not exist with certainty...

749
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:41,990
...in definite places, but rather
shows tendencies to exist.

750
00:54:42,054 --> 00:54:43,838
Tendency?
What's that mean?

751
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:48,408
Let's say we want to observe
an electron out there.

752
00:54:48,513 --> 00:54:53,142
We cannot say it is in a definite
place, we can rather say it...

753
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:57,823
...has a tendency to be out there
in the front, rather that in...

754
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:03,258
...the back, or here to the left,
rather that over there to the right.

755
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:08,563
In scientific language we actually
don't speak about tendencies...

756
00:55:08,635 --> 00:55:11,227
...we speak about probabilities.

757
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:15,856
I seem to remember voting for a bill that
gave some physicists a lot of money for...

758
00:55:15,936 --> 00:55:19,628
...a detector that they said would
tell them exactly where an electron is.

759
00:55:19,715 --> 00:55:22,275
- Were we being gypped?
- Not at all.

760
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:29,592
The strange thing is that when you actually
make a measurement of the electron...

761
00:55:29,689 --> 00:55:35,474
...it is in a definite place, but between
measurements you can not say...

762
00:55:35,561 --> 00:55:40,732
...that it is in a definite place
or that it has traveled...

763
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:45,700
...a definite path from one
place to another.

764
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:48,799
You mean when you want to measure
it, it just sort of shows up?

765
00:55:48,894 --> 00:55:50,615
Yeah.

766
00:55:50,779 --> 00:55:54,285
Like out-of-work actors or presidential
candidates like Jack Edwards.

767
00:55:54,372 --> 00:55:56,395
What do you think?
What do you think?

768
00:55:57,476 --> 00:55:59,555
- Hey tough guy.
- Yeah.

769
00:56:02,284 --> 00:56:04,072
Oh, my knees hurt.

770
00:56:04,856 --> 00:56:06,921
O.K. Let me get this straight.

771
00:56:07,016 --> 00:56:12,596
You measure and the electron is
there, it shows up, like Tom said.

772
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:17,405
But in between measurements,
you can't say for sure that it's...

773
00:56:17,485 --> 00:56:20,841
...in a definite place or
even that it went on...

774
00:56:20,913 --> 00:56:23,033
...a definite path from
one place to another.

775
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:27,763
So how does it go from here to there?
It moves, doesn't it?

776
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:30,067
No.

777
00:56:30,603 --> 00:56:34,090
- You mean it stays in the same place?
- No.

778
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:37,786
Either the electron moves,
or it doesn't move.

779
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:40,130
Well, you can't say that.

780
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:45,355
Well, are you getting a feeling now
of what these physicists felt?

781
00:56:45,426 --> 00:56:49,486
You see, an electron doesn't
move from place to place.

782
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,844
And it doesn't stay in
one place, either.

783
00:56:52,357 --> 00:56:58,553
It manifests itself as probability
patterns spread out in space.

784
00:56:58,657 --> 00:57:03,753
And the shape of these probability
patterns changes with time...

785
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:07,761
...something which might seem like
movement to human perception.

786
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:13,205
Are you saying that the electron
gets smeared out over a large...

787
00:57:13,286 --> 00:57:17,118
...region and then when you measure
it with the measuring gun...

788
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:19,199
...it collapses into a small point?

789
00:57:19,926 --> 00:57:21,623
You got it.

790
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:26,590
All subatomic particles,
electrons, protons, neutrons...

791
00:57:27,147 --> 00:57:35,024
...manifest this strange existence
between potentiality and reality.

792
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:41,096
So at the subatomic level,
there are no solid objects.

793
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:44,192
No, there are not.

794
00:57:44,281 --> 00:57:47,416
Well, if there are no solid objects
at the subatomic level...

795
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:50,789
...how are there solid
objects at any level?

796
00:57:50,877 --> 00:57:52,596
That's the amazing thing.

797
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:57,773
This simple question, what
makes this rock so solid?

798
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:01,001
...goes way beyond our
power of imagination.

799
00:58:01,073 --> 00:58:05,089
I mean, I cannot explain
this to you in visual terms.

800
00:58:05,169 --> 00:58:07,610
Of course I can do it in
mathematical equations...

801
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,209
...but there's no metaphor for it.

802
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:13,570
How can you live in a
world that's unmetaphorical?

803
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:17,368
I mean, you have to
perceive reality in some way.

804
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,072
I mean, this is solid.

805
00:58:21,026 --> 00:58:23,306
O.K.

806
00:58:23,427 --> 00:58:28,215
Let's take an atom from
within this granite...

807
00:58:28,295 --> 00:58:31,347
...the silicon atom with
its 14 electrons.

808
00:58:31,452 --> 00:58:39,624
The probability patterns of these
electrons arrange themselves...

809
00:58:39,703 --> 00:58:45,404
...like shells around the nucleus,
each shell containing several electrons.

810
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:50,652
Within the shells the electrons are
every where at the same time...

811
00:58:50,717 --> 00:58:55,553
...so to speak, but the probability
patterns that resemble shells...

812
00:58:56,097 --> 00:59:00,955
...are extremely stable and
very hard to compress.

813
00:59:01,459 --> 00:59:07,216
Matter is solid because probability
patterns are difficult to compress?

814
00:59:07,308 --> 00:59:10,045
That's as good as it gets.

815
00:59:10,134 --> 00:59:13,298
So I was right to sleep
through Mr. Gides' physic class...

816
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,939
...that model he made me out
of tinker toys with sticks...

817
00:59:16,018 --> 00:59:18,787
- ...and balls that was wrong, right?
- Right, wrong.

818
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:24,663
Yeah, it's a lousy visualization,
but then, no one did it any better.

819
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:27,900
"If the doors of perception were
cleansed everything would...

820
00:59:27,905 --> 00:59:31,460
...appear as it is, infinite."
William Blake.

821
00:59:56,085 --> 01:00:01,525
So, Sonia, life's a bunch of
probability patterns running around.

822
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:06,392
- Probability patterns of what?
- Of interconnections.

823
01:00:07,152 --> 01:00:09,367
What?

824
01:00:09,793 --> 01:00:14,686
Well, what I'm trying to say is
that this probabilities are not...

825
01:00:14,774 --> 01:00:20,584
...probabilities of things, but
probabilities of interconnections.

826
01:00:20,649 --> 01:00:22,997
See, Jack. That's what
she was trying to tell you.

827
01:00:23,045 --> 01:00:28,023
See, we tend to think of subatomic
particles are some kind of small...

828
01:00:28,087 --> 01:00:31,551
...billiards balls or small grains of sand.

829
01:00:31,591 --> 01:00:35,643
But for physicists a particle
has no independent existence.

830
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:42,637
A particle is essentially a
set of relations that reach...

831
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,166
...outward to connect
with other things.

832
01:00:46,254 --> 01:00:47,986
What are those other
things, please?

833
01:00:48,058 --> 01:00:51,553
They're interconnections of
yet other things which also...

834
01:00:51,634 --> 01:00:54,722
...turn out to be interconnections,
and so on, and so on.

835
01:00:54,778 --> 01:00:58,842
In atomic physics we never
end up with any things at all.

836
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:06,688
The essential nature of matter lies
not in objects, but in interconnections.

837
01:01:09,537 --> 01:01:13,185
Everybody knows the chord, it's a
third, the most basic of harmonies.

838
01:01:13,273 --> 01:01:15,774
It carries with it a very
distinctive feeling, no?

839
01:01:15,879 --> 01:01:20,334
And yet it's individual notes
carry none of that feeling.

840
01:01:20,862 --> 01:01:25,018
Therefore, the essence of
the chord lies in its--

841
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:27,442
Lies in relationships.

842
01:01:27,698 --> 01:01:31,759
And then the relationship
between time and pitch...

843
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,193
- Makes melody.
- Makes melody.

844
01:01:37,112 --> 01:01:42,488
- Relationships make music.
- Relationships make matter.

845
01:01:42,586 --> 01:01:46,137
- Music of the spheres.
- As Kepler said.

846
01:01:46,209 --> 01:01:50,380
- And Shakespeare before him.
- And Pythagoras before him.

847
01:01:50,828 --> 01:01:53,797
Now, this vision of the universe
arranged in harmonies of...

848
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:57,180
...sounds and relations
is no new discovery.

849
01:01:57,636 --> 01:02:00,980
Today, physicists are simply proving
that what we call an object...

850
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:07,979
...an atom, a molecule, a particle,
is only an approximation, a metaphor.

851
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:12,341
At the subatomic level, it
dissolves into a series of...

852
01:02:12,388 --> 01:02:17,373
...interconnections like chords
of music. It's beautiful.

853
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:19,973
Yeah, but there are
boundaries, aren't there?

854
01:02:20,053 --> 01:02:23,660
I mean, between you
and me, for instance.

855
01:02:24,357 --> 01:02:30,513
We are two separate bodies, aren't
we? That's not an illusion. Is it?

856
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:37,042
Are you saying that there
is a physical connection...

857
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:41,304
...between you and me, and
you and the wall behind you...

858
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,839
- ...and the air and this bench?
- Yes.

859
01:02:48,584 --> 01:02:53,081
At the subatomic level there
is a continual exchange of...

860
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:57,025
...matter and energy between
my hand and this wood...

861
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:03,801
...between the wood and the air,
and even between you and me.

862
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:07,648
I mean a real exchange of
photons and electrons.

863
01:03:07,714 --> 01:03:10,857
Ultimately, whether
we like it or not...

864
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:16,273
...we're all part of one
inseparable web of relationships.

865
01:03:42,632 --> 01:03:48,363
- How does all this explain light?
- Yes, finally, light.

866
01:03:49,307 --> 01:03:52,391
Light doesn't need a medium
because although it...

867
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:56,169
...travels in waves, it also
travels as particles.

868
01:03:58,513 --> 01:04:00,929
Light is both particles and waves?

869
01:04:00,993 --> 01:04:05,833
Yes, but the particles of light,
which we call photons...

870
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,869
...are of a very special kind.

871
01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:12,165
Unlike other particles,
they never stands still.

872
01:04:12,574 --> 01:04:15,020
They never speed up,
they never slow down.

873
01:04:15,108 --> 01:04:18,756
They always travel at the same
speed. The speed of light.

874
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:23,215
And the waves are not
ordinary waves, like water waves.

875
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:28,843
They're abstract patterns of
probabilities traveling in the form...

876
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:31,955
- ...of waves.  -Patterns of
relationships like everything else?

877
01:04:32,043 --> 01:04:34,598
- Exactly.
- I get it...

878
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,222
Well, I don't get it.
But I... I get it.

879
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:43,374
Let there be light.

880
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:48,577
And like light, a great variety of
other high-energy particles...

881
01:04:48,665 --> 01:04:51,300
...cosmic rays bombard the earth.

882
01:04:51,364 --> 01:04:55,112
All these particles colliding
with the air creating...

883
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,232
...more particles, interacting
further, creating and...

884
01:04:58,303 --> 01:05:02,240
...destroying more particles, and we
are in the middle of this cosmic...

885
01:05:02,303 --> 01:05:07,260
...dance of creation and destruction.
All of us, all the time.

886
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:10,820
- Shiva Nataraj.
- I beg your pardon?

887
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:13,841
Shiva Nataraj.
The hindu god of dance.

888
01:05:13,904 --> 01:05:17,254
The hindus believe that Shiva's
dance sustains the universe...

889
01:05:17,325 --> 01:05:22,743
...that Shiva's dance IS the universe.
A ceaseless flow of energy going...

890
01:05:22,806 --> 01:05:26,155
...through a multiplicity of patterns
dissolving into one another...

891
01:05:26,227 --> 01:05:28,315
- That's physics.
- No, that's poetry.

892
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:33,401
That's wonderful.
No, really. That's great.

893
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:36,444
But I hope it doesn't bother anybody.

894
01:05:36,507 --> 01:05:40,203
What do you do with this?
What's it for?

895
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:42,444
You don't do anything
with it, I don't think.

896
01:05:42,524 --> 01:05:44,349
You just think about it,
just contemplate it.

897
01:05:44,428 --> 01:05:47,916
You guys hungry? I'm hungry.
Let's go get something to eat.

898
01:05:59,853 --> 01:06:04,309
How can they do that here? I mean,
how can they do that anywhere?

899
01:06:04,372 --> 01:06:06,868
- It's your fault.
- What?!

900
01:06:07,502 --> 01:06:09,550
Well, O.K., it's not your fault.

901
01:06:09,629 --> 01:06:11,693
It's physicists' fault.
They made the bomb.

902
01:06:11,749 --> 01:06:15,573
Well, you can't blame
littering on the bomb.

903
01:06:15,662 --> 01:06:19,062
Why not? The bomb made
the whole planet disposable.

904
01:06:19,133 --> 01:06:21,879
Littering is an expression
of powerlessness.

905
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:24,119
Like, "hey, what difference
does more crap make?"

906
01:06:24,215 --> 01:06:26,487
It's all going anyway.
Kaplooey!

907
01:06:26,574 --> 01:06:28,653
Maybe you're right.

908
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:38,326
You know, I visited
Hiroshima 10 years ago.

909
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,590
I went to the museums.

910
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:45,295
I saw the photographs
of devastation.

911
01:06:45,382 --> 01:06:48,848
I went to the Peace Park.

912
01:06:49,592 --> 01:06:54,920
Looked at all the monuments...
the statue of a mother with a baby...

913
01:06:54,992 --> 01:06:59,481
...the statue of a goddess
enveloped in paper cranes...

914
01:07:00,121 --> 01:07:02,243
...Big Peace Bell.

915
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:09,732
And then I saw a mound about
6 feet high covered with grass.

916
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:12,137
It wasn't decorated in any way.

917
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:16,234
It wasn't a symbol of
anything, no monument.

918
01:07:19,779 --> 01:07:24,818
It simply contained the ashes
of the atomic bomb victims.

919
01:07:25,346 --> 01:07:30,594
The actual remains of what was
left of tens, maybe hundreds...

920
01:07:30,658 --> 01:07:34,171
...and thousands of men and
women and children...

921
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,954
...incinerated because
of our knowledge.

922
01:07:39,787 --> 01:07:47,828
A flash of light that burned them
and obliterated them and totally...

923
01:07:47,907 --> 01:07:52,764
...transformed the world.

924
01:07:53,459 --> 01:07:58,509
And as I stood in front of
that mound of ashes I...

925
01:07:59,669 --> 01:08:04,850
...felt that I was face-to-face
with the victims of--

926
01:08:07,332 --> 01:08:10,716
I can't say it. The victims of...

927
01:08:10,764 --> 01:08:14,956
...my work as a
scientist, as a physicist.

928
01:08:20,037 --> 01:08:22,069
I cried.

929
01:08:27,678 --> 01:08:30,574
When I was little, up on the
third floor with my brother...

930
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:33,917
...we'd lay on our beds watching
the heat lightning flashes...

931
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:35,555
...and he'd say "What's that?"

932
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:39,693
And I'd say "That's it, that's the
big one, we're all going to die."

933
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:44,247
You can't make yourself responsible
for Hiroshima, Sonia...

934
01:08:44,303 --> 01:08:46,495
...just because you do physics.

935
01:08:46,575 --> 01:08:49,728
You didn't invent the bomb. And
even if you had, somebody...

936
01:08:49,887 --> 01:08:52,628
...else decided to use
it, a politician.

937
01:08:53,581 --> 01:08:56,198
Oppenheimer said he felt he
had blood on his hands...

938
01:08:56,278 --> 01:08:58,486
...and he did invented it.
President Truman's answer was...

939
01:08:58,542 --> 01:09:00,246
"Who the hell does he think he is?

940
01:09:00,325 --> 01:09:02,831
I'm the one who ordered
them to drop the damn thing."

941
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,918
Even Oppenheimer wasn't to blame.

942
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:08,193
Scientists are supposed to figure
things out, the rest of us figure...

943
01:09:08,289 --> 01:09:10,690
...out what to do about it.

944
01:09:10,762 --> 01:09:13,114
I'm sorry, Sonia. I was kidding.

945
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:17,472
Maybe littering is more an expression
of poor toilet training, hmm?

946
01:09:18,073 --> 01:09:21,958
I don't know, maybe we
could change the subject.

947
01:09:22,822 --> 01:09:27,574
There's no accountability for
scientists as there is for...

948
01:09:27,678 --> 01:09:29,478
...other professions.

949
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:31,854
Why aren't we obliged, like
medical doctors, to not...

950
01:09:31,911 --> 01:09:34,815
...use our knowledge destructively?

951
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,518
It's not that simple. I don't think.

952
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,608
Oppenheimer said he had
blood in his hands.

953
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:43,264
He had regrets after the fact.

954
01:09:43,863 --> 01:09:47,368
I have regrets because
of my x-ray laser.

955
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:52,104
See, I'm responsible for the
consequences of my discovery.

956
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:58,965
You know, we never talked about
responsibility at the university...

957
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:02,158
...not in my time.
We never discussed ethics.

958
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:05,014
We were never taught value thinking.

959
01:10:05,078 --> 01:10:10,095
No one induced upon us the
wisdom of the american...

960
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:13,846
...indian tribes who made all their...

961
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:17,287
...important decisions with the
seventh generation in mind.

962
01:10:19,031 --> 01:10:22,408
We were never taught to think
about the future that way.

963
01:10:22,496 --> 01:10:26,471
We were taught in our closed rooms
that we were doing pure science...

964
01:10:27,095 --> 01:10:35,482
...in pursuit of pure truth.
The noble pursuit of pure truth.

965
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:39,424
Well, that's what science is, Sonia.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

966
01:10:39,521 --> 01:10:45,431
No, that's what science was maybe,
but pure science hardly exists today.

967
01:10:45,519 --> 01:10:49,080
The scientist isn't sitting in his
lab anymore choosing to work...

968
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:53,144
...on what fascinates him most.
Science is expensive.

969
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:57,864
The Pentagon, who pays most of it,
decides what is fascinating.

970
01:10:57,912 --> 01:11:05,064
70% of all science done in the United
States today is paid by the military.

971
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:10,512
We give our knowledge away without
thinking about the values...

972
01:11:10,577 --> 01:11:13,554
...without thinking about
who is responsible.

973
01:11:14,018 --> 01:11:15,946
But there is oversight.

974
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:18,240
I've served on some of those
oversight committees.

975
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:23,304
Scientism is an irrational belief
in the truth of science.

976
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:28,150
It's become a religion today.

977
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:32,386
It's not a good religion, but
it is a dominating religion.

978
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:37,450
And people, of course, who see
what miracles physicists...

979
01:11:37,514 --> 01:11:41,827
...are able to achieve, like going to
outer space, splitting atoms...

980
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:46,130
...or making bombs, believe that
scientists who are so powerful...

981
01:11:46,204 --> 01:11:50,674
...also must be very wise, and
so they don't question their...

982
01:11:50,754 --> 01:11:54,996
...work anymore and they leave
their own responsibility in the...

983
01:11:55,059 --> 01:12:00,980
...hands of these people they envision
to have this power of knowledge.

984
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:05,795
And although they know that
scientists are doing scary...

985
01:12:05,876 --> 01:12:09,373
...things in the shadows, they just
hope that they will be careful.

986
01:12:10,517 --> 01:12:14,901
And then scientists hand
over THEIR responsibility...

987
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:17,685
...to those who are paying them.

988
01:12:18,357 --> 01:12:22,886
And I know what happens when
you hand over your responsibility...

989
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:27,441
...to those who pay you,
like I did with my laser.

990
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:32,243
It broke my heart.

991
01:12:32,427 --> 01:12:35,348
If you're worried about the possible
dangers of genetic engineering...

992
01:12:35,411 --> 01:12:38,052
...you get advice from a scientist.

993
01:12:38,124 --> 01:12:40,373
He's the only one who understands.

994
01:12:40,429 --> 01:12:43,052
You pretty much have to
take his word for it too...

995
01:12:43,132 --> 01:12:46,724
...because often you don't
know even what questions to ask.

996
01:12:49,313 --> 01:12:53,124
Science should welcome your
questions, because science...

997
01:12:53,186 --> 01:12:55,556
...itself should question everything.

998
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:59,051
You know, these oversight committees
hold hearings from time to time...

999
01:12:59,619 --> 01:13:04,658
...where the public is invited to
comment, maybe you should be there.

1000
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:07,562
Personally, you might be
able to do some good.

1001
01:13:10,337 --> 01:13:13,377
He's still running. Only the
Terminator can stop him.

1002
01:13:14,114 --> 01:13:16,138
Should we get the check?

1003
01:13:16,234 --> 01:13:19,561
- I'll pay.
- Oh, no, no.

1004
01:13:26,846 --> 01:13:31,305
1968, Chicago.
Democratic Convention.

1005
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,435
The cops are getting ready to charge
the demonstrator and I'm standing...

1006
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:37,664
...next to this guy who I've never
before seen, and I say to him...

1007
01:13:37,707 --> 01:13:42,529
"Well, I'm going home". He says
"Don't go home, go into politics"

1008
01:13:42,596 --> 01:13:44,588
...and like a fool, I listened to him.

1009
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,817
That guy was Jack who is today
a conservative democrat...

1010
01:13:48,877 --> 01:13:51,351
...whatever the hell that is.

1011
01:13:51,352 --> 01:13:54,810
I was working for a delegate,
I wasn't even a demonstrator.

1012
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:58,738
I was just trying to get into the Hall.
Then the cops charged the crowd.

1013
01:13:58,795 --> 01:14:03,235
We all got tear-gassed, I broke my nose.
We spent the night in Mayor Daley's jail.

1014
01:14:04,853 --> 01:14:07,504
Whatever happened to all those people?

1015
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:11,456
Jesse Jackson got most of them.
The rest went to sleep.

1016
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:14,114
I don't mean politically, Jack.
The primaries are over.

1017
01:14:14,178 --> 01:14:17,797
Personally... whatever happened to them?
Where they live? What do they do?

1018
01:14:17,866 --> 01:14:19,352
I don't know personally.

1019
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,871
But politically, the Green Party
got them, at least in Europe.

1020
01:14:21,944 --> 01:14:25,509
Peace activists, environmentalists,
the feminists, the whole student left...

1021
01:14:25,607 --> 01:14:28,661
...the Green Party got them all.

1022
01:14:28,711 --> 01:14:30,493
What happened to them really?

1023
01:14:30,561 --> 01:14:33,704
I think it proves that ecological thinking
is getting stronger and stronger...

1024
01:14:33,781 --> 01:14:38,788
...people who see the whole picture,
who see that all these questions...

1025
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:41,006
...are related to each other.

1026
01:14:41,055 --> 01:14:44,707
- She's back.
- And Gorbachev?

1027
01:14:44,752 --> 01:14:47,955
Gorbachev? Was he at the
Chicago Demonstration?

1028
01:14:51,589 --> 01:14:54,718
Mom. I thought you
were with those men.

1029
01:14:54,778 --> 01:15:00,201
- I am. They're out there. Hello, Roman.
- Bonjour, Madame.

1030
01:15:04,763 --> 01:15:09,538
We're going to the beach.
I'm changing my shoes.

1031
01:15:13,566 --> 01:15:17,033
- What's the trouble?
- Nothing.

1032
01:15:18,218 --> 01:15:22,881
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, it's...

1033
01:15:22,926 --> 01:15:27,667
...just I can't stand you talking
about what's wrong with the world...

1034
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:31,970
...and your new vision of reality,
when what I hear is that...

1035
01:15:32,048 --> 01:15:35,005
...you're talking about
your own problems.

1036
01:15:35,099 --> 01:15:39,876
How your self feel disconnected,
I mean, you can't even relate to me.

1037
01:15:42,339 --> 01:15:48,148
- Are you coming with us this time?
- Yeah. Come, Kit. Please.

1038
01:15:53,657 --> 01:15:57,099
- Do you mind if I go?
- No.

1039
01:15:57,739 --> 01:16:01,991
I like Jack. Be real with him.
Don't bore him to death.

1040
01:16:02,074 --> 01:16:06,056
- Kit, he's a married man.
- It could do you some good.

1041
01:16:19,623 --> 01:16:22,837
In the 1968, Richard Nixon
won the youth vote.

1042
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:27,718
In 1980 and 1984 Ronald
Reagan did the same thing.

1043
01:16:29,745 --> 01:16:32,434
Majority of americans
are very conservative.

1044
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:38,273
I think we are dealing with a historical
process that's so deep that...

1045
01:16:38,336 --> 01:16:41,176
...even americans won't be
able to resist it much longer.

1046
01:16:41,248 --> 01:16:45,679
When I look around in the sciences, I see
the same patterns emerging everywhere...

1047
01:16:45,721 --> 01:16:50,135
...the same notions of holism, the same
thinking in terms of processes...

1048
01:16:50,191 --> 01:16:54,499
...instead of structures. It's happening
in America too, because once something...

1049
01:16:54,549 --> 01:16:57,316
...takes hold in the sciences, it will spread.

1050
01:16:57,376 --> 01:17:00,220
It always has, whether we like it or not.

1051
01:17:01,915 --> 01:17:04,650
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1052
01:17:05,366 --> 01:17:07,927
I thought you'd given up on America.

1053
01:17:22,843 --> 01:17:25,129
What's wrong with him?

1054
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:28,986
The color has probably caught him.

1055
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:32,868
He's a poet.
He's got a license to be moody.

1056
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:38,260
It's taken him miles from his
home, but it's kept him free.

1057
01:17:39,486 --> 01:17:45,718
I sometimes think he can change
his thoughts, his point of view...

1058
01:17:45,826 --> 01:17:47,897
...about anything anytime he wants.

1059
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:50,491
When he meets someone like
you who sees things in a...

1060
01:17:50,556 --> 01:17:53,519
...completely new way, he's
totally free to go along with it.

1061
01:17:53,582 --> 01:17:58,035
And should you succeed in really
changing his views and win him over.

1062
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:02,651
You can be sure, he'd put those
new ideas into a play or...

1063
01:18:02,697 --> 01:18:07,383
...a poem and people would
admire him for his flexibility.

1064
01:18:07,442 --> 01:18:12,418
And you... you feel
constrained by your constituency.

1065
01:18:13,066 --> 01:18:14,948
Yeah, kind of.

1066
01:18:16,408 --> 01:18:18,628
They want me to be the good
old conservative democrat...

1067
01:18:18,713 --> 01:18:21,864
...they voted for and
basically, that's what I am.

1068
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:27,162
Anyway, I'm supposed to represent
them. It's not all up to me.

1069
01:18:28,039 --> 01:18:32,325
It's supposed to be the will of the people
that sets the course and the government...

1070
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:35,697
...that finds the means, the best
way to give the folks what they want.

1071
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:43,880
Of course, it's all a mess right now.
The problems are so complex.

1072
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:47,424
There's so much crossover
from one problem to another.

1073
01:18:47,492 --> 01:18:50,043
It's hard for people to even
begin to think about them.

1074
01:18:54,634 --> 01:18:58,623
But still... I think Thomas Jefferson
was every bit as...

1075
01:18:58,687 --> 01:19:02,069
...great a mind as Isaac Newton was.

1076
01:19:02,124 --> 01:19:04,747
I doubt if there's been a better
form of government...

1077
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:08,066
...anywhere in history ever and,
of course, getting into...

1078
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:11,296
...politics is nothing to be ashamed of.

1079
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,270
To me it's still the biggest
challenge there is.

1080
01:19:16,024 --> 01:19:19,433
But things are changing
faster and faster every day.

1081
01:19:20,227 --> 01:19:23,531
A few years back, the greenhouse
effect was just a theory...

1082
01:19:23,589 --> 01:19:26,302
...and now... we're
just not keeping up.

1083
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,455
But, Sonia, the question is,
can your ideas change that?

1084
01:19:29,522 --> 01:19:31,897
Hasn't a lot of what we've
talked about been discussed...

1085
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:36,572
...and recognized already, recognized
in all the environmental legislation?

1086
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:41,195
Clean water in '72. Clean air in '77.
12, 14 years ago.

1087
01:19:41,258 --> 01:19:42,642
And we're still falling behind.

1088
01:19:42,712 --> 01:19:45,047
So can your ideas make
these things move faster?

1089
01:19:45,315 --> 01:19:48,483
I mean, if you're going
to wait for most of the...

1090
01:19:48,549 --> 01:19:51,253
people to be ready to go along
with you, before you move...

1091
01:19:51,317 --> 01:19:53,380
which is what you have to do...

1092
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:57,260
I'm sure you're not a secret
lover of dictatorships, but...

1093
01:19:57,354 --> 01:20:02,849
...wouldn't it take some totalitarian
regime to put ideas as comprehensive...

1094
01:20:02,914 --> 01:20:08,994
...as yours into effect? So, how
does all this translate into politics?

1095
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:13,285
Is this just going to be the best
conversation I've had in months or is...

1096
01:20:13,348 --> 01:20:15,913
...there still a chance you can get me
elected president? That's what I...

1097
01:20:15,997 --> 01:20:21,443
- ...want to know.
- You're still asking me for a program.

1098
01:20:21,507 --> 01:20:25,705
I'm trying to make you
embrace a vision...

1099
01:20:26,283 --> 01:20:29,368
...but you just want to know
what the packaging is.

1100
01:20:29,432 --> 01:20:33,315
I'm a practical man.
I'm from Missouri.

1101
01:20:33,363 --> 01:20:39,554
- I thought you were from the east coast.
- That's an expression. It means: Show Me.

1102
01:20:40,713 --> 01:20:43,903
Devising policies, that's your job.

1103
01:20:45,743 --> 01:20:49,832
I do think that as long as you
continue looking at things...

1104
01:20:49,901 --> 01:20:53,814
...through that old
patriarchal-cartesian-newtonian lens...

1105
01:20:53,878 --> 01:20:57,247
...you're going to miss out
on what the world really is.

1106
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:04,732
You, we, all of us, we need a new vision
of the world and we need a more...

1107
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:09,137
...comprehensive, more
inclusive science to support us.

1108
01:21:11,329 --> 01:21:15,893
There is a new theory emerging
now which places all the ecological...

1109
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:21,565
...concepts we've talking about into
one coherent, scientific framework.

1110
01:21:21,634 --> 01:21:28,297
We call it Systems Theory,
the theory of living systems.

1111
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:31,276
Living systems?

1112
01:21:31,341 --> 01:21:37,835
All living organisms as well as
social systems and ecosystems.

1113
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:42,031
This theory would help us get
a much firmer grasp on...

1114
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:44,599
...the sciences that deal with life.

1115
01:21:44,676 --> 01:21:48,964
Are these all your own ideas,
or do other people share them?

1116
01:21:49,028 --> 01:21:52,362
Has these been applied
in the sciences anywhere?

1117
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:56,823
Am I a crank?
It's O.K., senator.

1118
01:21:57,364 --> 01:22:01,852
This is real science, and many
scientists, including some...

1119
01:22:01,932 --> 01:22:06,414
...Nobel laureates, have
been working on these ideas...

1120
01:22:06,499 --> 01:22:12,013
Prigogine, Bateson, Maturana,
just to mention a few.

1121
01:22:13,332 --> 01:22:18,410
Yes, it is science,
but of a new kind.

1122
01:22:19,247 --> 01:22:23,993
Instead of concentrating on
basic building blocks, the...

1123
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:28,563
...systems view concentrates
on principles of organization.

1124
01:22:28,637 --> 01:22:32,910
Instead of cutting things to
pieces, it looks at the...

1125
01:22:32,985 --> 01:22:36,397
...living system as a whole.

1126
01:22:37,671 --> 01:22:41,671
How can you think usefully about
things in this holistic way?

1127
01:22:41,734 --> 01:22:46,741
You can contemplate them, you
can look at them, as Thomas says...

1128
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:51,352
But if you want to do something,
if you want to get into specifics...

1129
01:22:51,392 --> 01:22:54,501
...by definition, don't you
have to take things apart?

1130
01:22:55,142 --> 01:22:59,549
How you can talk usefully about
a tree without talking...

1131
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:03,031
...about its roots, or
its leaves or its bark?

1132
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:07,181
Well, I could without even
naming the parts you mention.

1133
01:23:07,268 --> 01:23:11,628
A cartesian would look at
the tree and conceptually take...

1134
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:15,726
...it to pieces, but then he
would never really understand...

1135
01:23:15,802 --> 01:23:18,045
...the nature of the tree.

1136
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:21,782
A systems thinker would look
at the tree and see the...

1137
01:23:21,842 --> 01:23:26,410
...seasonal exchange between
tree and earth, earth and sky.

1138
01:23:26,971 --> 01:23:32,405
Would see the annual cycle,
which really is one big breath...

1139
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:37,874
...the earth takes through its
forests, providing us with oxygen.

1140
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:44,981
A breath of life, linking the earth
with the sky and us with the universe.

1141
01:23:45,059 --> 01:23:52,123
A systems thinker would look at the
tree and see the life of the tree...

1142
01:23:52,201 --> 01:23:56,005
...only in relation to the
life of the whole forest.

1143
01:23:57,154 --> 01:24:02,470
Would see the tree as a habitat
for birds, a home for insects.

1144
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:09,494
But if you look at the tree and try to
understand it as something separate...

1145
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:13,871
...you will be bewildered by the
millions of fruits it's producing...

1146
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:19,979
...in its lifetime because only one or
two trees will grow from those fruits.

1147
01:24:20,661 --> 01:24:25,709
Though if you look at the tree
and see it as a member of a...

1148
01:24:25,804 --> 01:24:30,565
...larger living system, that
abundance of fruits will make...

1149
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:35,504
...sense, because hundreds upon
hundreds of forest animals...

1150
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:41,343
...and birds will survive because
of them... Interdependence.

1151
01:24:41,419 --> 01:24:45,272
And the tree cannot
survive on its own, either.

1152
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:48,367
To draw water from the ground
it needs the fungus that...

1153
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:52,153
...grows at the tip of each root,
and the fungus needs the...

1154
01:24:52,235 --> 01:24:55,855
...root to survive, and
the root needs the fungus.

1155
01:24:55,926 --> 01:24:58,180
If one dies, the other dies.

1156
01:24:58,243 --> 01:25:02,565
And there are millions of
relationships like this in our world...

1157
01:25:02,649 --> 01:25:05,409
...each depending on
each other for life.

1158
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:12,485
The Systems Theory recognizes
this web of relationships...

1159
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:16,094
...as the essence of all living things.

1160
01:25:16,162 --> 01:25:20,393
Only the uninformed would call such
a notion naive or romantic...

1161
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:26,339
...because this dependency we
all share is a scientific fact.

1162
01:25:26,392 --> 01:25:28,404
A web of relationships?

1163
01:25:28,459 --> 01:25:33,765
Yes, but this time it is
the web of life itself.

1164
01:25:33,841 --> 01:25:41,476
The theory of living systems actually
provides you with an outline...

1165
01:25:41,564 --> 01:25:47,845
...of an answer to that eternal
question: What is Life?

1166
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:54,712
O.K., Sonia. Let's hear it.
What's life?

1167
01:25:54,780 --> 01:26:02,120
In system language the answer would be...
The Essence of Life is Self-Organization.

1168
01:26:03,345 --> 01:26:06,665
- What's so funny?
- That's great.

1169
01:26:07,989 --> 01:26:13,621
What is life, ma'am? Is self-organizing,
I mean, that's very nice.

1170
01:26:13,664 --> 01:26:15,799
That's very, very, very, nice.

1171
01:26:15,859 --> 01:26:18,559
That's very nice, ma'am.
That's very, very nice.

1172
01:26:18,582 --> 01:26:22,717
I don't know, it sounds like something
out of Alice in Wonderland.

1173
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:27,261
Maybe somebody down here speaks
your language... Jabberwocky?

1174
01:26:29,635 --> 01:26:32,317
You know, as Merlin once
said to King Arthur...

1175
01:26:32,365 --> 01:26:35,937
"Don't dishonor your feast by
rejecting what's come to it"

1176
01:26:36,014 --> 01:26:39,357
Well said.
What is life?

1177
01:26:39,415 --> 01:26:44,412
Life is self-organizing.
Well, that's just extraordinary.

1178
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:49,626
Yes, it is.
And it means something specific too.

1179
01:26:49,658 --> 01:26:56,937
It means that a living system is
self-maintaining, self-renewing...

1180
01:26:57,001 --> 01:27:00,441
- ...self-transcending.
- What does self-maintaining mean?

1181
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:06,435
Well, it means that a living
system, although depending on...

1182
01:27:06,511 --> 01:27:10,306
...its environment, is
not determined by it.

1183
01:27:10,374 --> 01:27:13,886
Take the yellow fields of rye
around this island, with all...

1184
01:27:13,977 --> 01:27:17,353
...the rain here those fields
should be green all year round...

1185
01:27:17,448 --> 01:27:20,988
...but every summer
they turn yellow, why?

1186
01:27:21,076 --> 01:27:28,206
Well, to use a metaphor, each plant
"remembers" that it originated...

1187
01:27:28,269 --> 01:27:31,364
...in the hot and dry climate of
southern Asia, it remembers...

1188
01:27:31,428 --> 01:27:37,427
...and not even a dramatically different
climate can change its inner workings.

1189
01:27:37,529 --> 01:27:42,348
- Self-maintaining, self-organizing.
- I see.

1190
01:27:42,418 --> 01:27:46,002
What about self-renewing?
What does that mean?

1191
01:27:46,064 --> 01:27:51,479
Take us. Like all living organisms,
we are constantly replacing...

1192
01:27:51,535 --> 01:27:57,589
...ourselves in continuous cycles,
much faster than you can imagine.

1193
01:27:58,391 --> 01:28:01,987
You pancreas, for example,
do you know that it replaces most...

1194
01:28:02,063 --> 01:28:04,965
...of its cells within 24 hours?

1195
01:28:05,038 --> 01:28:07,933
That means that you wake up with
a new pancreas each morning...

1196
01:28:07,995 --> 01:28:10,638
...and a new stomach lining as well.

1197
01:28:10,691 --> 01:28:14,727
And you skin, do you know that
your skin falls off at the rate of...

1198
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,189
...100,000 cells a minute?

1199
01:28:18,262 --> 01:28:22,157
Do you know that most of the
dust in our homes consists of our...

1200
01:28:22,233 --> 01:28:24,790
...own dead skin cells?

1201
01:28:24,844 --> 01:28:29,111
That'll get into a poem.
Our households are filled with dead skin.

1202
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:34,950
But at the same time, as all
these dead cells are being shed...

1203
01:28:35,021 --> 01:28:38,669
...just as many are dividing
and producing new skin.

1204
01:28:39,758 --> 01:28:41,329
That's self-renewing.

1205
01:28:41,397 --> 01:28:44,434
As Heraclitus once said "A man
can't step into the same river...

1206
01:28:44,509 --> 01:28:47,737
...twice", Sonia says a man can't
shake hands with the same man...

1207
01:28:47,805 --> 01:28:51,235
- ...twice with the same hand, right?
- Yes and no.

1208
01:28:51,306 --> 01:28:54,811
Though most of our cells are
being replaced, we do recognize...

1209
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,457
...each other because the
pattern of our organization...

1210
01:28:59,547 --> 01:29:02,284
...is still the same.

1211
01:29:02,353 --> 01:29:05,732
That's one of the important
characteristics of life...

1212
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:12,159
...continuous structural change,
but stability in the pattern...

1213
01:29:12,226 --> 01:29:15,833
- ...of the system's organization.
- And that's all there is to life?

1214
01:29:15,911 --> 01:29:20,130
No, there is self-transcending.

1215
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:25,116
Self-organization is not
only the living systems...

1216
01:29:25,161 --> 01:29:30,164
...maintaining themselves and
continuously renewing themselves.

1217
01:29:30,902 --> 01:29:35,832
It also means that they
have an inherent tendency to...

1218
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:43,353
...transcend themselves, to
reach out and create new forms.

1219
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:49,797
That is one of the most exciting
parts to me that the basic dynamics...

1220
01:29:49,877 --> 01:29:54,891
...of evolution it's not
adaptation, it's creativity.

1221
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:57,943
You mean living systems will
evolve just for the hell of it?

1222
01:29:58,012 --> 01:30:00,629
They'll go exploring whether
they need it for survive or not?

1223
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:03,486
I'm not so far out of
step as I usually suppose?

1224
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:10,014
No, you're not. Creativity
is a basic element of evolution.

1225
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:14,272
Every living organism has
the potential for creativity...

1226
01:30:14,364 --> 01:30:17,993
...for surprising and
transcending itself.

1227
01:30:18,056 --> 01:30:22,386
- Creating what, for instance, beauty?
- Oh, yes, beauty too.

1228
01:30:22,462 --> 01:30:27,836
Evolution is so much more than
adaptation to the environment...

1229
01:30:27,901 --> 01:30:34,241
...because what is the environment
if not a living system wich evolves...

1230
01:30:34,309 --> 01:30:41,907
...and creatively adapts itself?
So, which adapts to which?

1231
01:30:42,653 --> 01:30:47,655
Each to the other,
they... co-evolve.

1232
01:30:48,268 --> 01:30:56,057
Evolution is an ongoing dance,
an ongoing conversation.

1233
01:30:56,141 --> 01:30:59,176
We are systems, and
the planet is a system.

1234
01:30:59,962 --> 01:31:05,307
We don't evolve on the planet,
we evolve with the planet.

1235
01:31:05,362 --> 01:31:10,708
Wouldn't it be extraordinarily
powerful if you could introduce...

1236
01:31:10,772 --> 01:31:14,004
...just that one idea into
the political dialogue?

1237
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:16,455
Yeah, Jack. There might be
something in this for you to...

1238
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:20,831
...renew you candidacy,
while as for Sonia and myself--

1239
01:31:20,871 --> 01:31:25,059
I beg you're going to say it was
my destiny to come here and...

1240
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:30,467
...meet Sonia and listen to these ideas.
What am I going to do about this?

1241
01:31:31,931 --> 01:31:34,875
I come from a country where
they use 40% of the world's...

1242
01:31:34,946 --> 01:31:38,172
...resources to support 6% of
the world's population, which...

1243
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,152
...makes the population so
happy and peaceful that we're...

1244
01:31:41,224 --> 01:31:43,463
...the world's biggest drug market.

1245
01:31:43,527 --> 01:31:47,017
Half our teenagers contemplate
suicide, one in five girls has tried it.

1246
01:31:47,993 --> 01:31:51,462
Would a system thinker give
nuclear energy a second thought?

1247
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:54,133
We're up to our necks
in all of its waste.

1248
01:31:54,224 --> 01:31:57,645
And the most important issue of
what you've just been saying...

1249
01:31:57,737 --> 01:32:03,023
...is the obsessive pursuit of
growth. That has to stop.

1250
01:32:03,098 --> 01:32:06,127
I know, I know.
I've been over this a hundred times...

1251
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:09,740
...obsessive growth, pathological
growth, destructive growth...

1252
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:12,218
...but how are you going to
get anybody to accept it?

1253
01:32:12,312 --> 01:32:15,328
What am I going to do?
Where do you start?

1254
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:20,611
We have to give importance to
the next generation, and the next.

1255
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:25,415
It was only when we
failed to include them in...

1256
01:32:25,516 --> 01:32:29,046
...our scientific theories, and
in our pursuit of growth...

1257
01:32:29,138 --> 01:32:32,729
...that we placed all
living systems in jeopardy.

1258
01:32:32,781 --> 01:32:39,581
Just contemplate that horrifying
fact that we are leaving to our...

1259
01:32:39,675 --> 01:32:44,760
...children the most poisonous
of wastes: plutonium.

1260
01:32:45,229 --> 01:32:49,123
It's going to remain poisonous
for the next generation...

1261
01:32:49,167 --> 01:32:51,001
...and the next, and the next.

1262
01:32:51,077 --> 01:32:55,254
In fact, it's going to remain
poisonous for a half million years.

1263
01:32:55,324 --> 01:32:59,753
We should never have accepted
that theory "Knowledge is power".

1264
01:32:59,821 --> 01:33:02,530
We should never have accepted
the idea that what's good for...

1265
01:33:02,595 --> 01:33:08,935
...General Motors is good for America.
We need a sustainable society.

1266
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:12,724
One in which our needs are being
satisfied without diminishing...

1267
01:33:12,826 --> 01:33:16,538
...the possibilities of
the next generation.

1268
01:33:16,614 --> 01:33:20,644
You're asking me--
You're asking me what should you do?

1269
01:33:20,716 --> 01:33:23,264
I don't know what you should do.
You know what you should do.

1270
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,516
I know that what worked for me
was to come here, be quiet...

1271
01:33:28,501 --> 01:33:34,147
...and take one thing at a time,
think one thought to its end.

1272
01:33:34,202 --> 01:33:40,550
Now, that was my first real step...
Telling you was my second.

1273
01:33:40,612 --> 01:33:42,554
You can't pass the buck that easily.

1274
01:33:43,764 --> 01:33:47,061
How about doing something
direct about this?

1275
01:33:47,113 --> 01:33:51,113
How about helping me?
How about joining my staff?

1276
01:33:51,825 --> 01:33:54,369
What--
What do you mean?

1277
01:33:54,434 --> 01:33:55,903
I don't know...

1278
01:33:55,971 --> 01:33:59,392
Finding a way to get these ideas of
yours into the political mainstream.

1279
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:03,846
You say the ideas are practical,
I'll give you a chance to prove it.

1280
01:34:03,913 --> 01:34:08,247
It would be a frustrating work,
you'd have to watch a lot of lying...

1281
01:34:08,325 --> 01:34:11,836
...and wheeling and dealing and
learns how to compromise, too.

1282
01:34:11,893 --> 01:34:15,069
You'd have to get your hands dirty.

1283
01:34:16,821 --> 01:34:23,080
I get them dirty the way I
want here, in my Ivory Tower...

1284
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:27,081
...where I can sit and think.

1285
01:34:27,805 --> 01:34:31,527
Jack, with his tenacious
pursuit of the common good, not...

1286
01:34:31,595 --> 01:34:35,074
...to mention his own career,
just doesn't seem to understand...

1287
01:34:35,123 --> 01:34:37,386
...how an individual
could want to get away...

1288
01:34:37,911 --> 01:34:41,479
...a long, long way away,
thousands and thousands and...

1289
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:43,796
...thousands of miles away.

1290
01:34:43,849 --> 01:34:47,022
So you can be a voice crying
in the wilderness instead...

1291
01:34:47,094 --> 01:34:51,475
...of being one of many voices trying
to be heard over the clamor?

1292
01:34:51,992 --> 01:34:56,614
Believe me, I can
appreciate being here...

1293
01:34:57,155 --> 01:35:00,439
I can understand why
that would be nice...

1294
01:35:02,953 --> 01:35:06,964
I see the pedestrian
nature of political work, but...

1295
01:35:07,526 --> 01:35:13,364
Look, if you're going to say no,
don't say anything just think it over.

1296
01:35:27,262 --> 01:35:29,579
What time does the tide actually come in?

1297
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:34,209
It will be soon now. It's going
to reach its all-year high today.

1298
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:39,448
We can go closer.
Come.

1299
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:43,614
Thomas must like you.

1300
01:35:44,187 --> 01:35:48,892
He doesn't usually have this much
time for other people's ideas. Do you?

1301
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:55,440
Not yours, maybe.
No, that's not nice.

1302
01:35:55,509 --> 01:35:58,167
Yes, I like her.
I like you.

1303
01:35:58,221 --> 01:36:02,968
You have a lot of guts to
come here, isolate, stay put...

1304
01:36:03,035 --> 01:36:05,710
...determine to figure things
out until you had something...

1305
01:36:05,778 --> 01:36:09,815
...to offer a couple of
sods like you and I.

1306
01:36:10,393 --> 01:36:13,060
A lot of people talk about
doing things like that.

1307
01:36:13,136 --> 01:36:15,908
But how many people actually do it?

1308
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:18,696
You could have stayed as long,
read as much, and decided...

1309
01:36:18,734 --> 01:36:20,993
...you have nothing to offer.

1310
01:36:21,062 --> 01:36:24,867
An isolation in and of itself
is a very scaring thing, Jack.

1311
01:36:24,939 --> 01:36:28,137
So, yeah, I like you.
I like you, too.

1312
01:36:28,193 --> 01:36:31,639
It was very brave of you to listen. I'd
have been disappointed if you hadn't.

1313
01:36:32,838 --> 01:36:38,596
But you know, Jack, I'm not
so sure that strong-arming her...

1314
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:42,411
...into a washingtonian office is
exactly where she needs to be right now.

1315
01:36:42,459 --> 01:36:45,578
In fact, it may be exactly
where she doesn't need to be.

1316
01:36:45,662 --> 01:36:47,958
What's eating you?

1317
01:36:48,923 --> 01:36:52,602
Yeah, you're right.
What is this, group therapy?

1318
01:36:57,063 --> 01:37:00,425
All this is covered in water
when the tide comes in, isn't it?

1319
01:37:00,476 --> 01:37:02,211
Oh, yes.

1320
01:37:02,279 --> 01:37:05,539
Including the pastures, must
take a special breed of sheep...

1321
01:37:05,615 --> 01:37:08,651
...to be able grazing here
around with all this salt.

1322
01:37:08,702 --> 01:37:12,648
And how could the grass grow
without the manure and the...

1323
01:37:12,696 --> 01:37:14,434
...sheep grazing on it?

1324
01:37:14,506 --> 01:37:18,127
I wouldn't be surprised if the people
here have a taste for salty lambs...

1325
01:37:18,211 --> 01:37:25,275
...so the people are in it too... the
sea, the grass, the people, the sheep.

1326
01:37:27,255 --> 01:37:33,910
<i>"You asked me what the lobster is
weaving down there with its golden feet?</i>

1327
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:37,699
<i>I tell you, the ocean knows this.</i>

1328
01:37:38,517 --> 01:37:43,479
<i>You say, who is the ascidia
waiting for in its transparent bell?</i>

1329
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:48,746
<i>I tell you, it's waiting
for time, like you.</i>

1330
01:37:49,727 --> 01:37:54,150
<i>You say, who does the
Macrocystis algae hug in its arms?</i>

1331
01:37:54,234 --> 01:38:00,258
<i>Study it, study it at a certain
hour, in a certain sea I know.</i>

1332
01:38:00,974 --> 01:38:04,553
<i>You question me about the
wicked tusk of the narwhal...</i>

1333
01:38:04,617 --> 01:38:07,959
<i>...and I respond by describing
to you how the sea unicorn...</i>

1334
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:12,612
<i>...with a harpoon in it dies.</i>

1335
01:38:13,338 --> 01:38:17,290
<i>You inquire about the
kingfisher's feathers which tremble...</i>

1336
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,988
<i>...in the pure springs
of the southern shores...</i>

1337
01:38:21,828 --> 01:38:24,932
<i>I want to tell you that
the ocean knows this...</i>

1338
01:38:25,034 --> 01:38:30,547
<i>...that life in its jewel boxes
is endless as the sand...</i>

1339
01:38:30,622 --> 01:38:35,603
<i>...impossible to count, pure, and that
time among the blood-colored grapes...</i>

1340
01:38:37,289 --> 01:38:41,108
<i>...has made the petal hard
and shiny, filled the...</i>

1341
01:38:41,178 --> 01:38:44,614
<i>...jellyfish with light, untied its
knot letting its musical threads...</i>

1342
01:38:44,671 --> 01:38:48,959
<i>...fall from a horn of plenty
made of infinite mother-of-pearl.</i>

1343
01:38:49,701 --> 01:38:53,473
<i>I'm nothing but the empty net which
has gone on ahead of human eyes...</i>

1344
01:38:53,549 --> 01:38:56,892
<i>...dead in the darknesses, of
fingers accustomed to the triangle...</i>

1345
01:38:56,964 --> 01:39:00,044
<i>...longitudes on the
timid globe of an orange.</i>

1346
01:39:00,678 --> 01:39:04,750
<i>I walked around like you
investigating the endless star.</i>

1347
01:39:06,269 --> 01:39:10,437
<i>And in my net during the
night I woke up naked.</i>

1348
01:39:11,407 --> 01:39:20,667
<i>The only thing caught?
A fish trapped inside the wind."</i>

1349
01:39:24,008 --> 01:39:26,651
Pablo Neruda.

1350
01:39:28,854 --> 01:39:32,076
Pablo Neruda!

1351
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:35,660
That remind you of anything?

1352
01:39:35,752 --> 01:39:39,522
"Walked around investigating the
endless star?"

1353
01:39:40,053 --> 01:39:42,573
Isn't that what you do, Sonia?

1354
01:39:42,616 --> 01:39:45,830
"And in my net during the night, I
awoke naked--" Isn't that what you do?

1355
01:39:45,893 --> 01:39:49,249
Don't you take your net and
throw it into these far-out places...

1356
01:39:49,296 --> 01:39:51,700
...of quantum physics
and systems theory?

1357
01:39:52,726 --> 01:39:55,505
And don't you find that the
only thing you ever catch...

1358
01:39:55,581 --> 01:39:57,663
...is your own self back again?

1359
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:03,787
Like a fish trapped inside the wind?

1360
01:40:06,201 --> 01:40:12,397
Where are the other people in your
system, Sonia... the ones you love?

1361
01:40:13,793 --> 01:40:17,203
And what about these tourists
here that we feel so superior to?

1362
01:40:17,267 --> 01:40:21,213
Aren't they, too, like fish
trapped inside the wind?

1363
01:40:21,273 --> 01:40:24,236
And, I don't know, maybe even the
feeling's more terrible for them...

1364
01:40:24,293 --> 01:40:28,023
...because they don't
have words to describe it.

1365
01:40:29,492 --> 01:40:33,622
So, tell me Sonia, where
are all of us in there...

1366
01:40:34,262 --> 01:40:41,572
...the real people with their qualities,
their longings, their weaknesses?

1367
01:40:43,005 --> 01:40:47,996
Where are you inside there, Sonia?
Where's Kit?

1368
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:51,755
You know, scientists can tell
us what life's internal...

1369
01:40:51,841 --> 01:40:55,417
...metaphors are, whether
they're computer chips or clocks.

1370
01:40:55,494 --> 01:40:59,207
Politician can tell us what
forms our lives should take...

1371
01:41:01,108 --> 01:41:03,495
But, uh...

1372
01:41:03,568 --> 01:41:09,166
I feel just as reduced being called a
system as I do being called a clock.

1373
01:41:09,226 --> 01:41:14,214
Life's just... just
not condensable.

1374
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:20,269
One group of people uses
one set of words to change...

1375
01:41:20,344 --> 01:41:23,957
...the world, then another
set of people come along with a...

1376
01:41:24,024 --> 01:41:29,457
...different set of words to change it.
And I don't mind, you know?

1377
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:33,425
It's all the same to me.
I don't mind a bit.

1378
01:41:33,442 --> 01:41:37,553
It's like the seasons
changing, and I like you.

1379
01:41:37,621 --> 01:41:40,394
I like your timorous courage.

1380
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:42,968
I like the fact that you want to
make the world a better place.

1381
01:41:44,386 --> 01:41:48,267
And I like my silly friend Jack
who's crazy enough to think...

1382
01:41:48,347 --> 01:41:52,269
...that he wants to be the
president of the United States.

1383
01:41:52,357 --> 01:41:57,555
And as for me... don't mind me.
I'm a... fool.

1384
01:41:57,627 --> 01:42:02,020
But remember...

1385
01:42:02,093 --> 01:42:08,969
Life feels itself.
Life feels itself.

1386
01:42:11,195 --> 01:42:14,805
Differently, perhaps, than all your
words for how to manage it.

1387
01:42:15,483 --> 01:42:19,302
And even with the best intentions in the
world you'll go wrong if you forget...

1388
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:22,477
...that life-- life-- life--

1389
01:42:22,557 --> 01:42:28,080
...life is infinitely more than yours
or my obtuse theories about it.

1390
01:42:28,518 --> 01:42:35,528
Healing the universe is an
inside job, and you've helped me.

1391
01:42:36,913 --> 01:42:39,385
And I love you.

1392
01:42:40,188 --> 01:42:45,086
And I love you too.
I love you both.

1393
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:49,899
Water!

1394
01:42:50,977 --> 01:42:54,946
What a day!
What a day!

1395
01:43:52,745 --> 01:43:57,507
Well, if we're going to go,
we better leave now.

1396
01:43:57,579 --> 01:43:59,973
Why don't you just stay?

1397
01:44:00,047 --> 01:44:05,302
I don't know. Why don't you
just come? Anyway, thanks.

1398
01:44:07,814 --> 01:44:09,892
Thank you.

1399
01:44:09,949 --> 01:44:15,715
Don't thank me, I loved the day.
I hate goodbyes.

1400
01:44:15,788 --> 01:44:19,838
Maybe it's not goodbye.
Please think about what I said.

1401
01:44:21,131 --> 01:44:25,540
- Let us know how the water raises.
- Does that matter?

1402
01:44:25,601 --> 01:44:30,355
Of course it matters.
Let it get all the way back the line.

1403
01:44:30,421 --> 01:44:35,007
Let it renew itself. Right, Sonia?
Maybe come to Paris to let me know.

1404
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:39,359
- Or Washington.
- Or New York.

1405
01:45:18,172 --> 01:45:24,556
<i>Where are the other people in your
system, Sonia... the ones you love?</i>

1406
01:45:27,377 --> 01:45:34,633
<i>The real people with their qualities...
their longings, their weaknesses.</i>

1407
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:37,000
Mom, are you O.K.?

1408
01:45:37,076 --> 01:45:41,590
<i>Where are you inside there, Sonia?
Where's Kit?</i>

1409
01:45:50,397 --> 01:45:53,635
What are you thinking?

1410
01:46:00,167 --> 01:46:03,639
Shall we go home?

1411
01:46:23,134 --> 01:46:27,255
<i>I feel like my long weekend in France
has just come to a close.</i>

1412
01:46:27,924 --> 01:46:31,696
<i>Maybe I, too, am tired of being
a stranger, of being outside...</i>

1413
01:46:31,768 --> 01:46:37,067
<i>...a language environment which lived,
which resonated inside me...</i>

1414
01:46:37,551 --> 01:46:42,722
<i>...our emotional system, as she might
say, needs a larger system to nurture it.</i>

1415
01:46:48,346 --> 01:46:49,880
<i>Doesn't make any difference.</i>

1416
01:46:49,939 --> 01:46:53,008
<i>You're locked in with the people you know,
you need to belong somewhere.</i>

1417
01:46:53,074 --> 01:46:56,321
<i>- He's right, of course,
about damn near everything.</i>

1418
01:46:56,881 --> 01:47:00,579
<i>Even the parts I didn't
understand felt right.</i>

1419
01:47:01,652 --> 01:47:07,327
<i>So... should
I just go with it?</i>

1420
01:47:08,978 --> 01:47:11,588
<i>Is this one of those turning points?</i>

1421
01:47:17,972 --> 01:47:24,700
<i>"You the woman, I the man, this the
world, and each is the work of all.</i>

1422
01:47:25,268 --> 01:47:28,535
<i>It is the muffled step in the sand,
the stranger, the crippled wren...</i>

1423
01:47:28,614 --> 01:47:31,655
<i>...the nun, the dance of the angels,
winging over the walkers in the village.</i>

1424
01:47:31,727 --> 01:47:35,483
<i>And there are many beautiful arms
around us and the things we know..."</i>

1425
01:47:36,883 --> 01:47:41,262
<i>I don't know how the
rest of that damn poem goes.</i>
