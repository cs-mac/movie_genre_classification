1
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:51,769
<i>Why should the Falls drag me
down here at 5 o'clock in the morning?</i>

2
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:55,773
<i>To show me how big they are
and how small I am?</i>

3
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:59,151
<i>To remind me they can
get along without any help?</i>

4
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:03,030
<i>All right, so they've proved it. But why not?</i>

5
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:06,367
<i>They've had 10,000 years to get independent. </i>

6
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,411
<i>What's so wonderful about that?</i>

7
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:13,623
<i>I suppose I could, too,
only it might take a little more time. </i>

8
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:49,798
Rose?

9
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,926
Rose?

10
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:15,379
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

11
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:18,341
- What is your destination in Canada?
- Niagara Falls.

12
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:21,510
- What's the name of the place?
- The Rainbow Cabins.

13
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:23,888
- What is your name?
- Mr and Mrs Ray Cutler.

14
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:26,432
- And where do you live?
- Toledo, Ohio.

15
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:28,142
- Where were you born?
- Toledo.

16
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,435
<i>- And where were you born?
- Seattle. </i>

17
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,814
Are you bringing in anything
besides personal belongings?

18
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:35,107
No.

19
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,984
- How long do you plan to be here?
- Three days.

20
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:40,570
- Honeymooners?
- That's right.

21
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,115
That isn't liquor you have in that case, is it?

22
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:47,618
Uh, books. I'm going
to catch up on my reading.

23
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:49,787
Reading?

24
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,961
Fine thing.

25
00:05:57,044 --> 00:06:01,548
<i>I tell him we're on our honeymoon and
you drag out a copy of Winston Churchill. </i>

26
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,550
<i>He must think I'm pretty hot. </i>

27
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:07,554
You should have told him
we're on a delayed honeymoon.

28
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:12,559
Delayed or not, we agreed to treat it
like a regular one, didn't we?

29
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:17,272
I'm game. It'll be just as good
as a regular honeymoon.

30
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,524
Well, it should be better.

31
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:22,110
I've got my union card now.

32
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:35,747
- Hi.
- Hi. We're the Cutlers.

33
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:38,542
- We wired for reservations.
- Oh, yeah.

34
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:43,880
Let's see now. The Cutlers, huh?

35
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:46,466
Room overlooking the Falls. Cabin B.

36
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:49,802
Look, honey. You can see it from here!

37
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:53,097
- The Falls are that way.
- He means the Shredded Wheat plant.

38
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:56,225
I work for 'em, but I'm seeing
the joint for the first time,

39
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:59,353
where breakfast food
became a national institution.

40
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:02,481
<i>Why don't they have that down
in that book of yours?</i>

41
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:05,526
- Say, has there been a call for me?
- A call? Nope.

42
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:10,697
I'd better phone over and tell 'em I'm here.
Have him show you the cabin, honey.

43
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:13,492
- There's a phone in my office.
- Thank you.

44
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,334
Oh, it's a beautiful view.

45
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:26,754
- Cabin B is ours?
- The folks in there haven't checked out yet.

46
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:28,965
Then we can't move in.

47
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,384
Come on. I told them last night.

48
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,054
Hello? I wonder if I could
talk to Mr Kettering, please.

49
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:38,182
Well, this is Ray Cutler
from the Toledo branch.

50
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:41,101
No, I'm not speaking from Toledo.
I'm here in Niagara.

51
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:44,313
Mr Kettering wrote me to get
in touch with him when I arrived.

52
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:48,608
I'm the guy that won the cash prize for
the most imaginative sales campaign.

53
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,782
<i>- Are you there, Mrs Loomis?
- Shh!</i>

54
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:02,288
Stop knocking. My husband's asleep.
What is it?

55
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,167
The new folks are here. You were
supposed to be out this morning.

56
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:09,962
Just a second.

57
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:31,524
I'm awfully sorry about the cabin, but
my husband hasn't been feeling too well.

58
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:35,153
Please don't make me move him.
He's finally fallen asleep.

59
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:39,573
- First good sleep he's had in over a week.
- Is he sick, Mrs Loomis?

60
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:43,786
Well, he's not quite himself.
He just sits around and...

61
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:49,750
Last night he got up and wandered around
somewhere at 3 or 4 o'clock. I was frantic.

62
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:54,129
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes. Lately we've seen quite a few.

63
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:56,089
But I don't want to bore you.

64
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:59,134
- You're here to have a good time, Mrs... ?
- Mrs Cutler.

65
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:03,972
We had a good time, too, two years ago
when we were here on our honeymoon.

66
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:07,850
So I thought it would do him some good
after Letterman. It was a mistake.

67
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:10,811
I'm sorry, Mrs Loomis,
but this cabin is promised.

68
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:14,648
That's all right. We'll take another cabin.
You don't care, honey?

69
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:18,152
We got here the wrong time all around.
No cabin, no Mr Kettering.

70
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:22,448
- He won't be back till the first of the week.
- It doesn't make a bit of difference.

71
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:25,284
Thanks for being so nice. I sure appreciate it.

72
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:29,162
And, Mr Qua, I've got to run down
to the market while George is asleep.

73
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:31,873
- Would you keep an eye out for him?
- Of course.

74
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:34,042
Thank you. Thanks.

75
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:40,298
- It's up to you folks. Cabin K is vacant.
- Does it look down at the Falls?

76
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,050
It looks around at them,
but it gets plenty of sun.

77
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,261
OK. Let's go.

78
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:52,017
- I'll get the key.
- Thanks.

79
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,644
I'll do it, honey.

80
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,563
She said her husband
was in Letterman. What's that?

81
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:59,733
It's an army hospital, mostly psycho.

82
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,443
Oh.

83
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:35,434
<i>Come on aboard. "Maid of
the Mist", the most famous boat in America. </i>

84
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:38,019
<i>Next tour starts in two minutes. </i>

85
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:18,323
I'll have two, please.

86
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,703
Two, please.

87
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:27,081
Thank you.

88
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:36,590
- What size shoe?
- Ten and a half.

89
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,928
Thank you.

90
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,225
- What size, sir?
- Eight, please.

91
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,736
- Your check, sir.
- Thank you.

92
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,448
You ready, honey?

93
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:42,862
Get back!

94
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,241
Get back!

95
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:03,506
Farther back, honey!

96
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,696
- What's the matter? I was coming down.
- Wasn't Mrs Loomis going shopping?

97
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,489
Yeah. Why?

98
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:33,410
Well, she sure got herself
an armful of groceries. Come on.

99
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:08,360
Rose?

100
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,906
Rose? Did you get the cigarettes?

101
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,702
- Didn't I give 'em to you?
- No, you didn't.

102
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:20,413
They're in my coat pocket, then.

103
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,277
Light me up, too, Georgie.

104
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:14,964
Mm, that felt good. Dry my back.

105
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:22,305
Bunch of kids must've checked in.
It's good to hear a laugh for a change.

106
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:53,501
- And I thought you forgot how to dance.
- There's still some Shredded Wheat in me.

107
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:56,379
- I'm thirsty.
- You are? Come on.

108
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:06,680
- Hi, Mr Qua. Having supper?
- No. Fresh figs. Have one.

109
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:10,642
- Best physic anybody ever had.
- No, thanks. Just a Coke.

110
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:24,239
Hey. Get out the fire hose.

111
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:39,879
Why don't you ever get a dress like that?

112
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:46,468
Listen, for a dress like that you've gotta
start laying plans when you're about 13.

113
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,648
- Would you mind playing this?
- Yeah. Sure thing, lady.

114
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,693
"Kiss. "

115
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:08,739
<i>Kiss me</i>

116
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:14,411
<i>Won't you kiss me?</i>

117
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,582
<i>Oh, kiss</i>

118
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:20,459
<i>Kiss me</i>

119
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:24,921
<i>Say you miss... </i>

120
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,090
What about it, lady?

121
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:30,093
Better not.

122
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:38,059
<i>With heavenly affection</i>

123
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:41,604
<i>Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo</i>

124
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,230
<i>Hold... </i>

125
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:47,192
- Plain Cokes or did you spike 'em?
- No, just plain. Would you like one?

126
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,153
No, thanks.

127
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:52,781
<i>Hold me, hold me... </i>

128
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,951
You kinda like that song,
don't you, Mrs Loomis?

129
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:01,706
<i>- There isn't any other song.
- With all your heart's protection</i>

130
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:07,754
<i>This is a moment of</i>

131
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:10,757
<i>Thrill</i>

132
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,509
<i>Thrill me, thrill me</i>

133
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:16,470
<i>Mmm</i>

134
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:22,434
<i>Take me, take me in your arms</i>

135
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:26,438
<i>And make my life... </i>

136
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,399
<i>Mmm, mmm</i>

137
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:33,403
<i>Perfection</i>

138
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:37,407
<i>Take me</i>

139
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:43,746
<i>Darling, don't forsake me</i>

140
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:47,667
<i>Kiss me, hold me tight</i>

141
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,923
<i>Love me, love me tonight</i>

142
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:22,700
Gee, I'm sorry. He was OK before.

143
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:26,871
I think he cut his hand. If you want,
we have some Mercurochrome.

144
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:30,833
- I wouldn't dare go in there right now.
- If you don't mind, I'll do it.

145
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,584
Well, thanks.

146
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,673
Your husband doesn't seem to like music.

147
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:42,469
Depends. He'll get right down and dig,
if you give him a rocking chair

148
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:45,138
and a corny old tune like "In the Gloaming".

149
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,943
What is it?

150
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,576
I brought you some Mercurochrome
for your hand. I'm Polly Cutler.

151
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:11,746
I suppose she sent you
to find out if I cut it off.

152
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,458
- Well, tell her I didn't!
- Do you want me to fix it or not?

153
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:21,923
I...

154
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:25,718
I guess it was silly, what I did.

155
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,638
But that song...

156
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:32,266
She didn't tell you about that, I bet.

157
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:34,226
Of course not.

158
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,021
She didn't say where
she first heard it or with who.

159
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:39,523
Well, she didn't tell me either.

160
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:41,817
Hold still, please.

161
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,195
Parading around,
showing herself off in that dress,

162
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:48,782
cut down so low in front
you can see her kneecaps.

163
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:52,202
- It's a stunning dress.
- Would you wear it?

164
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:57,749
<i>Well, I'm not the kneecap type.
She's a pretty girl. Why hide it?</i>

165
00:21:57,832 --> 00:22:00,293
Don't worry about that.

166
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:05,089
She'd like to wear it where everybody
could see her, in the Yankee Stadium.

167
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:07,466
She's a tramp!

168
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:11,261
I tell you now so you won't have to ask.

169
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:15,015
You love her very much, don't you?

170
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:19,102
What do you know about it?

171
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:23,023
You're stuck on her.

172
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:26,067
Otherwise, you'd walk off and forget her.

173
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,654
I...

174
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:32,698
I guess so.

175
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:35,284
That's some confession to make, isn't it?

176
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:39,163
Here. Let me fasten the end of this.

177
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:48,630
- What's that?
- It's 8. 30.

178
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:52,259
Look out the window.

179
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:10,693
Oh!

180
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:18,784
- Let's go out with the others.
- I can't see anybody now. I...

181
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:22,954
I feel goofy after what happened.

182
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,376
Let me tell you something.

183
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:31,379
You're young. You're in love.

184
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:34,549
Well, I'll give you a warning.

185
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,804
Don't let it get out of hand
like those Falls out there.

186
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:42,974
Up above it...

187
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:45,976
Did you ever see the river up above the Falls?

188
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:48,812
It's calm and easy.

189
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:51,607
If you throw in a log itjust floats around.

190
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,527
Let it move further down
and it gets going fast.

191
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:59,072
It hits some rocks and in a minute
it's in the lower rapids

192
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:05,036
and nothing in the world, including God
himself, can keep it from going over the edge.

193
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:08,206
Itjust goes.

194
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:12,835
Don't worry. I'm one of those logs
thatjust hang around in the calm.

195
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:15,755
<i>Hi. </i>

196
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:19,383
Hey, Polly, come on.
You're missing the big show.

197
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,011
- Got myself a ringside table.
- Oh.

198
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:28,600
Look at those.
Couple of colours I never heard of before.

199
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:31,978
- This is my husband, Mr Loomis.
- Hello.

200
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:36,858
- You got yourself quite a girl.
- Well, she'll do for a while.

201
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:39,027
Hi.

202
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:42,280
We better be going.

203
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:52,998
- What's that?
- Oh, it's a 1907 Maxwell.

204
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:56,627
You make different models from little kits.

205
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,130
Look kind of nice on a mantel...
if you have a mantel.

206
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:02,758
- It's cute.
- Be all right if I don't foul it up.

207
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:04,926
I generally foul things up.

208
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,596
- Don't be silly.
- I have lately, anyway.

209
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,223
Everything I touch, ever since Duluth.

210
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:15,561
I met her in a big beer hall.
She was the most popular waitress they had.

211
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,607
I guess it was the way
she put the beer on the tables.

212
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:27,364
Until then I ran a good sheep ranch. Then
all of a sudden the sheep went dumb, or I did.

213
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:30,868
That winter the sheep kept dying.

214
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:34,580
- Everybody gets a run of bad luck.
- That won't cover it.

215
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:39,376
I rented it to another rancher. He had
worse winters and made out all right.

216
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:45,465
She was bored with the ranch. We spent
half our time in town in bars and nightclubs.

217
00:25:46,591 --> 00:25:50,720
After that I fouled up a couple more jobs.

218
00:25:50,803 --> 00:25:53,931
Then Korea. I wentjust to show her
I was young enough.

219
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:56,267
They sent me home with battle fatigue!

220
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,478
So don't tell me
I can't foul up a 1907 Maxwell!

221
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:05,401
Didn't do any good to fix that hand.
You like to suffer.

222
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,111
Maybe.

223
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:13,700
- My wife told you I was neurotic.
- She just said you weren't feeling well.

224
00:26:13,783 --> 00:26:17,203
- She'd like everybody to believe I'm crazy.
- Don't be silly. Why?

225
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:20,290
I don't know, but she's got a reason.
You can bet on that.

226
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:22,458
She's got a reason.

227
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:25,211
Occupational therapy!

228
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:54,948
Hello? Is this the bus terminal? What time
do the buses leave tomorrow for Ottawa?

229
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:58,659
No, no, no. You got the wrong number.

230
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:01,579
This is McGrand's Boarding House.

231
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:05,750
Why don't you look up the right number
before you dial?

232
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,544
I'm sorry.

233
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,047
Mrs McGrand, that wasn't for me?

234
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:16,635
Nope. Someone for that bus terminal
again. It's the fourth time in two days.

235
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,596
Must have changed
the number or something.

236
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,611
Hello. You called.

237
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:40,199
Listen, it's got to be tomorrow.
Do you hear me? Tomorrow.

238
00:27:40,282 --> 00:27:42,576
He just made a big row in front of everyone.

239
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,455
After this, nothing's going
to surprise anyone. It's made to order.

240
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,124
Can you get him there?

241
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:53,253
There's always a way to handle George.
Be at the place as soon as it opens.

242
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:57,173
OK, kid. It's a date.

243
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:00,510
Good luck, darling.

244
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,921
- In Chicago you know what we're gonna do?
- No.

245
00:28:39,005 --> 00:28:41,299
We're going straight to Marshall Field.

246
00:28:41,382 --> 00:28:47,346
I'm gonna buy you the slinkiest, meanest,
laciest evening gown they've got.

247
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:49,556
- Price no object.
- Yeah?

248
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,686
And when we're all set to step, who'll pull
one of his jealous fits and lock the door?

249
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,272
Oh, no. No more of that stuff.
You wait and see.

250
00:28:57,356 --> 00:29:01,568
I'll take you to any dance place you want
and we'll have fun, the both of us.

251
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:03,737
You know what I'm gonna do?

252
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:12,620
Take lessons. Arthur Murray in six hours
can have you doing the rumba, the samba...

253
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:15,581
Georgie, this is quite a change.
What brought this on?

254
00:29:15,665 --> 00:29:17,750
You know what.

255
00:29:23,756 --> 00:29:26,425
- It's getting late. Hand me my slip.
- I hate to move.

256
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:30,512
When we have a fight and make up that way,
I never wanna leave your side.

257
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,807
Give me some orange juice, Georgie.

258
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:48,946
- You know, I'm sorry we're leaving today.
- Just as well.

259
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,124
Wish we'd brought the car.

260
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:05,170
Driving home, we could take our time
on the road and stop anyplace we please.

261
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:16,055
- Why are you getting dressed up?
- To pick up the bus tickets.

262
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:19,517
Pick up the tickets? We'll buy them
when we get to the terminal.

263
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,436
I'm not gonna stand all the way.
I want reservations.

264
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,941
There are no reservations.
We just go early and get aboard early.

265
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:31,820
You're getting all dressed up
to go out and buy tickets.

266
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:33,822
Why?

267
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:36,491
- Where are you going?
- Here we go again.

268
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:39,786
I'm not going to the bus station.
Do you feel any better?

269
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,207
- You smell cheap. I know what that means.
- Sure. I'm meeting somebody.

270
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:47,544
Just anybody handy, as long as he's a man.

271
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:50,964
How about the ticket seller?
I could grab him on my way out.

272
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:53,091
Or one of the kids with the phonograph.

273
00:30:53,174 --> 00:30:55,635
Anybody suits me. Take your pick.

274
00:30:55,843 --> 00:30:58,220
OK, OK, so I don't know this guy.

275
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,473
This guy you sing to, hum to.

276
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:01,640
Oh...

277
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:08,397
Build your Maxwell. I'll be back.

278
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:36,469
How do you like that?
You know what they say now?

279
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:39,472
Mr Kettering probably
won't be back till Tuesday.

280
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:41,599
If I'd only known that bef...

281
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:46,562
Hold it, kid. The sun's just right.

282
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:53,569
Now, swing around. We'll get a profile.

283
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:56,155
Come on, Polly. Profile.

284
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:02,452
That's it. Now inhale.

285
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,581
You've got nothing to hide. Inhale.

286
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:13,171
That's right.

287
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:17,133
What... ?

288
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:20,386
Oh. Just a minute, please.

289
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,805
Would you mind? Your shadow.

290
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:25,641
- Sorry, but have you seen my husband?
- No, I haven't.

291
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:28,519
- Isn't he in the cabin?
- That's just it.

292
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:33,816
You see, I left for the bus station and when
I got back... Mr Qua hasn't seen him either.

293
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:37,527
Oh, he probably went across the street
to get a magazine.

294
00:35:37,611 --> 00:35:41,239
He wouldn't do that. We have to be
at the bus station at 11 o'clock.

295
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:43,992
Well, you've still got 40 minutes.

296
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,620
I shouldn't have left him alone,
especially after last night.

297
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:49,998
He was so upset and everything.

298
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,083
Well, you saw it.

299
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,252
I'm sorry.

300
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:02,510
There's nothing to worry about. He's over
on the other side getting one for the road.

301
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,429
I don't know. I think I'd be worried.

302
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:09,975
<i>All right, now get back
into that same pose again. </i>

303
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,802
OK.

304
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:53,892
Oh, Sam! Bring in the Missing Persons file.

305
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:56,060
Right, sir.

306
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:08,072
- Anything important?
- Might be. What have we got that's recent?

307
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:10,616
Uh... A Mrs Verna McGuire.

308
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:13,535
Her daughter has been
missing since yesterday.

309
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:17,039
She's always missing.
Some fraternity house. What else?

310
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:18,665
Mm...

311
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:22,169
A man called George Loomis, a transient.

312
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:26,131
We got a call at four. People
named Cutler phoned in for his wife.

313
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:35,014
Call back. Tell them to meet me
at Table Rock House, souvenir shop.

314
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:37,183
Very well, sir.

315
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:07,712
- Afternoon. Which of you is Mrs Loomis?
- I am.

316
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:10,131
I'm Starkey, from the police station.

317
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:13,551
Where is he? You know
something about my husband?

318
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:15,136
- You're the Cutlers?
- Yes.

319
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:18,639
- You've heard something about him?
- Just that he is your husband.

320
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:21,642
Is there any chance
he could have come here today?

321
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:23,727
- Here?
- Yes, here.

322
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,938
No, not possibly. He hates the Falls.

323
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,743
- What are we doing here?
- Wasting your time, I hope.

324
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,290
- Hello, Mr Starkey.
- Did you check again?

325
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:48,918
Yes, sir, I did, and there's still one missing.

326
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:51,086
And over here...

327
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:56,341
Let me see 'em.

328
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:02,722
- Remember anything at all about the man?
- No, sir, I don't.

329
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,229
Ever seen these before?

330
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:13,649
They're his.

331
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:17,778
Why is everyone standing around?
Do something! Look for him!

332
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:20,031
Find him!

333
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:22,992
Listen, Mrs Loomis, you'd better go home.

334
00:39:23,075 --> 00:39:25,995
Have you got anyone
to take care of you? Any friends?

335
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,540
No. Well, that is, no one except these people.

336
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:32,334
- No one.
- No one? What about down below...

337
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,878
- Will you people take her home?
- Sure.

338
00:39:35,504 --> 00:39:37,589
Come on.

339
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:13,707
You've been very kind,
but thanks, I'd rather walk.

340
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:12,763
Hold on. Wait a minute.

341
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,517
I think we've got him. Yes. On the far side.

342
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:20,603
<i>It's hard to say.
I imagine he's pretty beat up. </i>

343
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,857
OK, we'll run him down to the morgue.

344
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:48,713
- Why didn't your friends bring you?
- I'm all right. Where is he?

345
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:53,134
- Listen, this isn't going to be pleasant.
- I don't expect it to be.

346
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:55,303
Please wait.

347
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:37,844
Mrs Loomis, do you identify this body
as that of your husband George Loomis?

348
00:42:55,944 --> 00:42:58,029
Hold her.

349
00:43:04,953 --> 00:43:07,038
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

350
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:09,791
I put in everything I thought she'd need.

351
00:43:24,513 --> 00:43:26,473
No.

352
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:29,059
Get away.

353
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:32,687
I wanna get away.

354
00:43:37,192 --> 00:43:39,485
What's all this? I want to talk to her.

355
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:42,780
Come around in the evening.
She'll be out till then.

356
00:43:46,158 --> 00:43:48,244
Please.

357
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:56,251
<i>- Business pretty good?
- Booked up for a month ahead. </i>

358
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:58,962
- How many you accommodate here?
- About 50.

359
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:00,922
- How's the food?
- It's good.

360
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:03,758
- Here she is anyway. Hi, Mrs Cutler.
- Hi.

361
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:06,595
Well, well, well, hello there.

362
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,683
Hey! Cinch to see you belong to the
Shredded Wheat family. I'm Jess Kettering.

363
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:14,560
- I want you to meet the big boss.
- How do you do?

364
00:44:14,644 --> 00:44:19,649
Sorry we weren't here when you arrived.
We'd have had red carpet over the bridge!

365
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:23,778
Oh, here's a little spinach for you,
by way of apology.

366
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:27,239
Hey... Hey, where's that
prize-winning husband of yours?

367
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:30,701
What a boy!
Turkey stuffed with Shredded Wheat.

368
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:33,078
Had it right the next day and I loved it!

369
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:38,124
You better move out of range, dear.
Jess likes to make his point.

370
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:42,587
Well, this is very sweet of you.
They're just lovely. Thank you.

371
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,882
- Isn't my husband back yet?
- He's been in and out all morning.

372
00:44:45,965 --> 00:44:50,636
We'll take you along in our car. Leave word
for that no-good husband to join us.

373
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,641
Before we're through you'll see the Cave
of the Winds, Goat Island, the Old Fort.

374
00:44:55,725 --> 00:45:00,896
And we're gonna get in the best fishing
you ever did. Just wait till you see our boat...

375
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,608
Now, Kettering, Mrs Cutler
would rather wait for her husband.

376
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:09,863
Speaking of Niagara, you and I could do with
a shower. We've been driving since six.

377
00:45:09,946 --> 00:45:12,741
The minute Ray gets back, we'll call you.

378
00:45:12,824 --> 00:45:16,161
You bet. Well, toodle-oo for now. Pip-pip!

379
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:18,329
Come on, mama!

380
00:45:32,968 --> 00:45:36,430
Oh, not that way, Mrs Cutler.
I put your things in Cabin B.

381
00:45:36,513 --> 00:45:41,476
I told your husband I won't charge you
one cent more. You've waited long enough.

382
00:45:42,185 --> 00:45:43,728
Thank you.

383
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:45,981
The key's in the door.

384
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,019
Mrs Cutler! What is it?

385
00:47:55,562 --> 00:47:57,230
Mrs Cutler!

386
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:00,567
Mrs Cutler!

387
00:48:06,281 --> 00:48:09,492
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I heard a yell a minute ago.

388
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:11,160
Polly?

389
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:13,329
Are you in there, Polly?

390
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:14,872
Polly!

391
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:26,967
What's the matter, honey?
What's the screaming about?

392
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:29,720
Get organised, baby. What's wrong?

393
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:32,472
- I was half-asleep...
- Yes?

394
00:48:32,556 --> 00:48:35,558
Now, look, darling,
it was probably just a nightmare.

395
00:48:35,642 --> 00:48:39,145
Now calm yourself down.
I'll get you a glass of water.

396
00:48:42,482 --> 00:48:44,567
It's all right. She's OK.

397
00:48:47,653 --> 00:48:49,488
Ray, don't!

398
00:48:49,572 --> 00:48:51,991
- Don't go in there, Ray.
- Honey, wake up.

399
00:48:52,074 --> 00:48:55,994
He's in there. He's alive.
He was standing right here looking at me.

400
00:48:56,078 --> 00:48:58,497
Polly, who was looking at you?

401
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,707
- Mr Loomis.
- Mr Loomis?

402
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,794
- No, Ray...
- No, Polly. I gotta prove it to you.

403
00:49:06,296 --> 00:49:09,674
Well, where is he?
Under the icebox? Under the sink?

404
00:49:09,758 --> 00:49:11,176
Oh, Polly.

405
00:49:11,968 --> 00:49:15,847
Mr Loomis. If I hear that name
once more, I'll start yelling myself.

406
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,977
No wonder it got you. We wait three years
for a honeymoon, then spend it with spooks.

407
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,855
Here. Drink this.

408
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:30,486
Mr Loomis! From the time we get here
we're patting his hand, burying him.

409
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:34,615
And her, running around sobbing,
asking if we'll pick out a tombstone.

410
00:49:34,698 --> 00:49:37,075
Why, it's enough to drive anybody nuts!

411
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:40,287
Well, we're gonna
kiss off this place right now.

412
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:43,289
Give me a hand
with this stuff, will ya, honey?

413
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,460
Sport clothes! All we needed here
was a couple of shrouds.

414
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,341
Sorry, Winnie.

415
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:55,926
What's this thing?

416
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:58,971
Oh, the flowers. The Ketterings brought them.

417
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:01,557
- The Ketterings?
- Yes. They stopped by.

418
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,267
- Here?
- Yes.

419
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:08,271
- We're supposed to have dinner with them.
- What do you know? JC Kettering himself?

420
00:50:08,355 --> 00:50:09,898
Yes.

421
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:13,652
Well, it's out. The way you feel,
the whole idea's silly.

422
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:18,114
Old JC, king of the VPs.

423
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:22,577
- He seems to think you're hot stuff, too.
- He does?

424
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,205
Well, that doesn't alter this
one way or the other.

425
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:30,042
Still, we have to eat somewhere.
Just a bite, maybe.

426
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:34,630
I'll tell you what, you lie down,
I'll get a shave and we'll decide later, OK?

427
00:50:34,713 --> 00:50:36,799
Now lie down.

428
00:51:12,374 --> 00:51:14,710
Hello. Police Department?

429
00:51:14,793 --> 00:51:17,754
Will you put me through
to Mr Starkey, please?

430
00:51:19,464 --> 00:51:23,218
Well, do you know where
I can reach him? I'm Mrs Cutler.

431
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:28,598
No, I can't be reached either. We're going
out with some people to see the Falls.

432
00:51:28,681 --> 00:51:32,477
But would you tell Mr Starkey
when he gets back to stay there?

433
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,479
I've gotta talk to him. It's about Mr Loomis.

434
00:51:36,439 --> 00:51:38,524
<i>Yes. </i>

435
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:17,186
All right. Everybody, listen to me.

436
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:19,521
That's it. The Cave of the Winds.

437
00:52:26,695 --> 00:52:31,783
At great risk to life and limb,
these bridges were built in 1885.

438
00:52:31,866 --> 00:52:34,535
A world-famous attraction ever since.

439
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:37,997
Now button up your coats real good
and follow me. Let's go.

440
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:40,708
It wasn't 1885. It was 1881.

441
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:44,795
Don't pay attention to him. I'll show you.
Come on, Ray boy. Follow me.

442
00:52:46,547 --> 00:52:50,884
Let them do the mountain climbing.
We're gonna go back and have a smoke.

443
00:52:51,009 --> 00:52:53,262
After all, it's just a lot of water.

444
00:52:53,387 --> 00:52:55,847
I think I'll stay here. You go on ahead.

445
00:52:55,931 --> 00:52:58,350
If you don't mind, I will.

446
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:42,725
<i>Oh, Polly!</i>

447
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:44,894
Polly, come on down.

448
00:55:23,196 --> 00:55:25,281
You killed that man.

449
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,784
What was I supposed to do?
He came after me with a wrench.

450
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:31,871
After that, it was a case of who killed who.

451
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,206
If it was self-defence, go to the police.

452
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,625
In the tunnel I found his claim check.

453
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:40,587
That meant I could put on his shoes
and walk out of there officially dead.

454
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,799
- For all the good that'll do.
- At least I can go somewhere,

455
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,844
find ajob, get organised, if you'll help me.

456
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,389
- Help you?
- You're the only one who knows I'm alive.

457
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,184
Your wife knows it. They found the body.

458
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,853
When she gets out of the hospital, she'll tell.

459
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,604
Hospital?

460
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,524
Rose won't talk.
She'd have to say to the police

461
00:56:01,607 --> 00:56:04,985
"I had a plan to kill my husband,
but it backfired. "

462
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:08,781
No, not Rose. She'll go to a new town,
drift up to the right bar stool...

463
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:10,741
<i>Polly!</i>

464
00:56:11,492 --> 00:56:13,243
What about it? Please.

465
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:14,703
Polly!

466
00:56:14,786 --> 00:56:17,581
I'd do the same for you if it meant as much.

467
00:56:18,623 --> 00:56:20,709
Let me stay dead.

468
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:24,045
Take your hands off me.

469
00:56:24,129 --> 00:56:26,756
<i>- Polly!
- Polly!</i>

470
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,051
<i>- Here I am.
- We got a lot more to see. </i>

471
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:53,979
Well, kids, sleep well tonight. We've gotta
be out on my boat at the crack of dawn.

472
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:58,108
Oh, Jess, do we have to get up
before the fish do? Why not 8 or 9 o'clock?

473
00:58:58,233 --> 00:59:01,361
Nonsense. Ray wants all the time
on that river he can get.

474
00:59:01,445 --> 00:59:05,449
- He's a real fisherman. Eh, boy?
- Well, I sure like it a lot.

475
00:59:05,532 --> 00:59:08,702
I hope we're not putting you out.
You've been so nice to us.

476
00:59:08,785 --> 00:59:13,832
Putting us out? Listen, I've been wanting
to meet Ray boy here for quite a while.

477
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:16,751
OK, 5 o'clock in the morning, right here.

478
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:19,378
"Olive oil", as the French say!

479
00:59:19,462 --> 00:59:21,547
Thanks a lot.

480
00:59:21,631 --> 00:59:23,591
Bye. Bye, Mrs Kettering.

481
00:59:23,674 --> 00:59:25,968
Sure did have a good time.

482
00:59:35,102 --> 00:59:38,605
Here, honey.
You take this and I'll check on the mail.

483
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:58,582
- Hello.
- Hello.

484
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:00,835
I've been using your view.

485
01:00:00,918 --> 01:00:05,005
- Is anything wrong?
- You just stole my question.

486
01:00:05,089 --> 01:00:08,842
My sergeant took a message. You wanted
to see me about the Loomis case.

487
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:11,178
It was urgent.

488
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:15,682
The sergeant's exaggerating. It wasn't
that important. Just a silly question.

489
01:00:15,765 --> 01:00:19,436
I hoped maybe that
you had heard from Mrs Loomis.

490
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,147
How could I? She'll be unconscious
for the rest of the day.

491
01:00:23,231 --> 01:00:28,694
Mrs Cutler, the doctor says only panic or
fear could have broken through that drug.

492
01:00:28,778 --> 01:00:31,989
What scared her so much
that she came to and skipped?

493
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:35,826
- Skipped?
- Yeah, disappeared from the hospital.

494
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:38,495
No mail, but old...

495
01:00:39,288 --> 01:00:44,418
What is this? If it's another funeral, have
the corpse leave his name at the desk!

496
01:00:44,501 --> 01:00:47,254
Loomis is trying to kill his wife. He's alive.

497
01:00:47,337 --> 01:00:49,839
Polly, you ought to have
your head examined.

498
01:00:49,923 --> 01:00:53,927
She had a nightmare. She thinks
this Loomis is alive, that he was here.

499
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:56,137
I thought we had this out.

500
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,515
It wasn't a nightmare.
He is alive and his wife knows it, too.

501
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,811
Oh, please, Polly! Mr Starkey, I'm sick
of this thing. Look what it's done to her.

502
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:08,816
If you've got a problem, take it someplace
else. We're washed up! We're through with it.

503
01:01:08,899 --> 01:01:10,985
Good night. Thank you, sir.

504
01:01:17,324 --> 01:01:21,077
I bought two tickets for Chicago.
Can I have a refund on one?

505
01:01:22,454 --> 01:01:24,289
Sure.

506
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:29,252
- That's $12. 50.
- Thanks.

507
01:01:59,364 --> 01:02:01,950
Well, are they gonna keep us here all day?

508
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:05,536
There'll be a delay. The police
are checking up on everybody's ID.

509
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:09,373
Checking up? Why?
The bus is supposed to leave at 5. 55.

510
01:02:09,498 --> 01:02:13,419
- At this rate, we'll never get home.
- They're looking for some dame.

511
01:02:13,502 --> 01:02:16,463
The bus'll make up for lost time
once we get started.

512
01:02:16,547 --> 01:02:19,299
<i>"Let's visit Niagara Falls. "</i>

513
01:02:19,383 --> 01:02:21,927
<i>I'm sorry I ever mentioned it. </i>

514
01:02:31,102 --> 01:02:31,936
Hop in.

515
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:35,106
Can you get me to the bus station
on the American side?

516
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:39,402
If you're not in too much of a hurry.
They've got a roadblock at the bridge.

517
01:02:39,485 --> 01:02:42,363
- Smugglers or something.
- That's no good, then.

518
01:02:42,446 --> 01:02:44,991
And the sidewalk?
Can I get through that way?

519
01:02:45,074 --> 01:02:49,912
Could be. Take that walk over there,
just to the right side of the gate.

520
01:02:49,995 --> 01:02:51,872
Thanks.

521
01:03:27,114 --> 01:03:29,825
<i>The tower is under control
of both countries, </i>

522
01:03:29,908 --> 01:03:33,662
but Americans claim them bells
don't play "The Star-Spangled Banner"

523
01:03:33,787 --> 01:03:37,415
<i>as well as they do "God Save the Queen". </i>

524
01:03:37,499 --> 01:03:42,003
Right over there on June 30th, 1859,
Blondin, a French tightrope walker,

525
01:03:42,086 --> 01:03:44,088
made his famous walk over the Falls.

526
01:03:44,172 --> 01:03:48,342
If you'll follow me, I'll show you
a little better where it happened.

527
01:04:10,155 --> 01:04:12,240
Hello? Hello? Police!

528
01:05:43,285 --> 01:05:45,203
Too bad.

529
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:47,789
They can't play it for you now, Rose.

530
01:06:05,973 --> 01:06:07,892
Georgie...

531
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:42,789
I loved you, Rose. You know that.

532
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,752
Ray boy, grab these cans.
You and I will get the gas.

533
01:11:43,878 --> 01:11:46,797
Boss, you run and get some liver.

534
01:11:46,922 --> 01:11:50,050
Polly-O, you run up
and get five or six bottles of beer.

535
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:54,054
All right now, everybody rush around.
Do yourjob. Jump to it.

536
01:11:54,137 --> 01:11:56,640
Just trying to get things organised.

537
01:11:56,723 --> 01:12:00,268
At home with the kids
he tries to organise pillow fights.

538
01:12:00,352 --> 01:12:03,438
- Come on, honey. Cheer up.
- I'm all right.

539
01:12:04,647 --> 01:12:08,985
Come on, kids. We haven't got all day.
Those fish are dying to get at our bait.

540
01:12:13,781 --> 01:12:17,451
This Canadian town of Chippewa.
Great Revolutionary War battles.

541
01:12:17,535 --> 01:12:20,162
<i>The British whipped us. </i>

542
01:12:20,245 --> 01:12:22,331
All right now. Very nice people.

543
01:12:22,414 --> 01:12:26,960
Polly, get the beer in there, huh?
Boss, you gotta get the liver down here.

544
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,220
- You the one who phoned?
- Yeah. I heard about it on the news later.

545
01:12:37,303 --> 01:12:41,766
There was a fella here seemed a lot like
that Loomis they're looking for. Had a scar.

546
01:12:41,849 --> 01:12:44,101
- How long ago?
- Maybe 10 o'clock.

547
01:12:44,185 --> 01:12:49,148
He come and asked could he rent a boat.
I didn't have nothing till 3 o'clock.

548
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:53,319
- He's trying to reach the American side.
- Yeah. Notice which way he went?

549
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:58,115
No, I was working on some tackle. But he
seemed awful anxious to get himself a boat.

550
01:12:58,198 --> 01:13:01,159
Thanks. If he shows up again, phone us.

551
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,786
Right.

552
01:14:08,682 --> 01:14:11,560
Hey! What's wrong over there?

553
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,645
Hey!

554
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,085
Get off this boat!

555
01:16:06,377 --> 01:16:08,713
Get off the boat!

556
01:16:08,796 --> 01:16:11,507
You're insane. You must be insane.
Where do you...

557
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:13,300
Get off!

558
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:33,653
Hey!

559
01:16:36,531 --> 01:16:38,616
Hey! Hey, you!

560
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:41,452
Hey!

561
01:16:56,216 --> 01:16:58,677
Hello? Give me the police.

562
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:08,728
No. No, I don't know whose boat it is.

563
01:17:08,811 --> 01:17:12,273
He shoved off toward the river.
There's some girl on the boat.

564
01:17:12,356 --> 01:17:14,442
Yeah. Yeah.

565
01:18:07,617 --> 01:18:10,495
Sorry. You wouldn't get off. Are you all right?

566
01:18:10,578 --> 01:18:12,705
Of course I'm all right.

567
01:18:14,707 --> 01:18:16,876
You turn this boat around.

568
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:20,880
- Go to the police and give yourself up.
- It's a little late for that now.

569
01:18:20,963 --> 01:18:23,466
Talk to the police.
Tell them it wasn't your fault.

570
01:18:23,549 --> 01:18:27,761
You should've done it two days ago.
Are you afraid to defend yourself?

571
01:18:27,845 --> 01:18:30,139
I can't.

572
01:18:31,348 --> 01:18:33,642
Not any more.

573
01:18:36,395 --> 01:18:38,897
I... killed Rose.

574
01:18:58,165 --> 01:19:02,294
- Any other boat in the inlet?
- No, there's nothing fast enough.

575
01:19:02,419 --> 01:19:04,505
Sorry.

576
01:19:07,174 --> 01:19:08,800
United States River Patrol.

577
01:19:08,884 --> 01:19:12,888
Morris, on United States River Patrol,
where are you? Come in.

578
01:19:13,555 --> 01:19:17,142
River Patrol. Morris speaking.
We're abeam of Navy Island.

579
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:20,561
Try to intercept a power launch.

580
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:23,648
<i>She's a 20-footer,
probably on her way to Buffalo. </i>

581
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:26,192
George Loomis is aboard.

582
01:19:26,275 --> 01:19:27,902
Yes, sir.

583
01:20:03,894 --> 01:20:07,564
He isn't crazy enough
to head downstream, is he?

584
01:20:51,231 --> 01:20:53,608
Where is he trying to go?

585
01:20:54,442 --> 01:20:56,945
I guess he's making a run for Gill Creek.

586
01:20:57,070 --> 01:21:00,490
<i>Mr Starkey, this is Morris
on the launch speaking. </i>

587
01:21:00,573 --> 01:21:03,451
<i>- Something wrong up ahead.
- Starkey here. </i>

588
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:08,247
Lost headway. Engine trouble or something.
They're in the drift.

589
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,842
There must be some gas on board.

590
01:21:20,926 --> 01:21:23,011
I don't think so.

591
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:42,238
- They're being pulled into the current.
- A 12-knot drift.

592
01:21:42,321 --> 01:21:46,075
- What does that mean?
- It means they're in real trouble.

593
01:22:05,635 --> 01:22:07,720
You can't. You'll be torn to pieces.

594
01:22:08,471 --> 01:22:12,391
Can't you tell 'em to hurry up
on that police boat? Can't they get there?

595
01:22:12,475 --> 01:22:15,853
Morris, on United States River Patrol,
can you reach them?

596
01:22:16,437 --> 01:22:21,650
No, sir. We're 1,000 yards past
the limit now. We're turning back.

597
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:34,496
Scuttle it.

598
01:22:34,913 --> 01:22:37,415
Scuttle it.

599
01:23:00,395 --> 01:23:03,523
If we can take on enough water, she'll ground.

600
01:27:57,511 --> 01:28:01,640
- What's the story?
- Take it easy, fellas. No photographs.

601
01:28:08,021 --> 01:28:10,523
- The car is waiting.
- Here, dear.

602
01:28:13,276 --> 01:28:15,820
Well, goodbye, Mr Starkey.

603
01:28:16,988 --> 01:28:18,573
And thank you.

604
01:28:18,656 --> 01:28:23,619
You've seen enough of the Falls for one trip,
but don't cross us off your list. Goodbye.

605
01:28:23,703 --> 01:28:25,788
<i>Goodbye, and my thanks. </i>

606
01:28:25,871 --> 01:28:29,750
I bet that was the first time anyone
ever used "Scuttle it" as a prayer.

607
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:31,919
And had it answered.
