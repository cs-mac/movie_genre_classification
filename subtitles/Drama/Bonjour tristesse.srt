1
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,634
Wait till they see these.

2
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:18,264
If they like the others,
they'll be crazy about these.

3
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:19,641
Like to look at them?

4
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,434
I'll see them at the show.

5
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,938
This is the best day of my life.

6
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:28,691
I have my first exhibition,
and I have you.

7
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,779
Cecile, will you marry me
when I'm a big success?

8
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,740
Let's give ourselves a little time.

9
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,592
Cecile!

10
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,832
Aren't you interested
in anything?

11
00:02:58,096 --> 00:03:00,098
Yes.
In going someplace else.

12
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,433
- Where?
- I don't know.

13
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,604
- Alone?
- Yes, alone.

14
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:11,693
- There. We're engaged.
- I don't want that.

15
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,278
All right.

16
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,281
Then we're engaged.

17
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,953
It's going to be a small wedding,
but you may come.

18
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,414
- Will I see you later?
- Yes.

19
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,499
Where?

20
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,376
I don't know.

21
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,243
I'll be ready in three seconds.

22
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,745
Any zipping or buttoning to do?

23
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,247
No, thanks, darling. It's all done.

24
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,792
Are we calling for Yvette?

25
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,586
Yvette is no longer with us.
We're calling for Denise.

26
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,922
- Model?
- Actress, aspiring.

27
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,841
Rather appetizing.
She's talented, too, she says.

28
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,301
The usual trinket?

29
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:03,346
Not quite this time.
It's pretty, though. Like to see it?

30
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,973
I'll see it later...

31
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,849
on Denise.

32
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:37,046
Jacques, there she is now.
Cecile?

33
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,590
- Cecile!
- Hello.

34
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:43,136
- I'm so glad to see you.
- I love your dress.

35
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:45,304
Oh, thank you.
You look adorable.

36
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,681
- How beautiful you look.
- Thank you.

37
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,767
And this is Denise-
Denise.

38
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,894
How do you do?
Good evening.

39
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,731
Cecile, this Jacques,
who's been dying to meet you.

40
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:56,136
- Hello. How are you?
- I'm fine.

41
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:58,067
- Have a drink?
- I'd love one.

42
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:01,070
Do you know I've been waiting
for a long time to meet you?

43
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:43,071
Now, I'm going to sit here.

44
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:46,783
Um, Denise?
Denise, you sit there.

45
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:50,369
Leann there, Paulette here,
Cecile.

46
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:53,623
- That's not going to work.
- Let's dance in the meantime.

47
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:06,260
May I take you to the races
tomorrow?

48
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,888
I'd love to go.
Thank you, Jacques.

49
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:18,272
And after the races
he'll take me to dinner and dancing again,

50
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:24,028
and on Thursday to the tennis matches,
and on Sunday to the country.

51
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:27,365
What a waste of time, dear Jacques.

52
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,493
What a hopeless waste of time.

53
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:36,624

and I'd like to warn him,
but he wouldn't understand,

59
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:08,072
that I can't feel anything
he might be interested in

60
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:11,659
because I'm surrounded by a wall,

61
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:16,539
an invisible wall
made of memories I can't lose.

Hey, how about a dance?

78
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,751
Half a dance.

79
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,962
Better than none.

80
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,047
He likes you.

81
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,340
He's very charming.

82
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:50,967
- How's Denise?
- Oh, great girl.

83
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,469
- This is going to be a fun evening.
- Yes, wonderful.

84
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,766
Oh, it's wonderful luck
having you for a daughter.

85
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,143
The luck runs both ways, sir.

86
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:07,608
But even with my father,
it isn't the same anymore.

87
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,986
Nothing is.

88
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,321
Will I ever be happy again,

89
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:16,617
as I was at the beginning of that
wonderful summer on the Riviera

90
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,911
just a year ago?

91
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,082
Seven was my magic number.

92
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,294
I was very superstitious then,
and loved it.

93
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,129
Seven and three.

94
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:31,215
The seven came out of my age, 17,

95
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:36,595
and the three from the three members
of our very happy household.

96
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,182
Good morning, Albertine.
My coffee, please.

97
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:44,312
Albertine has the sunstroke.
I'm her sister, Leontine.

98
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:47,940
So you are. Good morning, Leontine.
Is she very ill?

99
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:50,693
- You know how it is.
- I know how it is.

100
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:51,986
Good morning, Alber.

101
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,114
Albertine has the sunstroke.
This is her sister, Leontine.

102
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,866
I thought I felt a change.

103
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,492
Forgive me, Leontine,
and good morning.

104
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:00,786
My sister told me
what to expect.

105
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,331
Good morning, monsieur.

106
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,414
I don't think she approves
of our little household.

107
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,335
They lack imagination
down here.

108
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,128
More likely they have too much.

109
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,089
- Good morning, Cecile.
- Good morning, Raymond.

110
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,591
- Did you sleep well?
- Mm.

111
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:14,925
Did you wake well?

112
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,928
I never do, and you always do.
It's repulsively unfair.

113
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:19,930
Just wait till you're my age.

114
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,599
- How's Elsa?
- She's asleep.

115
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:25,144
And look at that wonderful sea.
High time we threw ourselves in.

116
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,396
All that vitality.

117
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,106
Elsa?

118
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:34,612
- Twice more.
- Why?

119
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,072
Three times is good luck.

120
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,782
- Pebbles and all?
- Of course.

121
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,576
Elsa? Elsa!

122
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,870
If you really want it to work,
you should do it seven times.

123
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:46,415
If I really want it to work,
I'll go and pull her out by the hair.

124
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:47,958
Wait.

125
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,544
Let's smell the day.

126
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,508
Good morning, Cecile.

127
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,635
Good morning, Raymond.

128
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,553
I'm up now.

129
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,853
Two letters for you.
One's from your office.

130
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:10,523
Throw it away.
It's vacation time.

131
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,983
It doesn't say who this one's from.

132
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,404
Look. Not bad.
Another week, it'll be ﬂatter than yours.

133
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:19,573
- But you're tempting the devil.
- Why?

134
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,951
Looking in the mirror
before noon.

135
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,496
Do I look that much fatter
in the morning?

136
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,874
It has nothing to do with the way you look.
You always look wonderful.

137
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,876
- It's bad luck, that's all.
- Why?

138
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,962
It just is. You'll see.

139
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,616
Elsa?

140
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,535
- I'm asleep.
- Then wake up.

141
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,705
- It's the middle of the night.
- No, it's the middle of a glorious morning.

142
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,206
It's raining.

143
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:09,874
It isn't.

144
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,294
It is. Great big drops.
I heard them on the door.

145
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,962
How do you feel?

146
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,590
As if I were swimming
in sizzling oil.

147
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,800
- You do look rather like a lobster.
- Raymond!

148
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,261
All because you were too lazy
to move out of the sun.

149
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,181
If you really adored me,
you would have moved the sun.

150
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,266
I adore you, all right.

151
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:32,313
- Good morning, Elsa.
- Good morning, Raymond.

152
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:32,896
Up.

153
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,274
Don't make me move.
I'll crack.

154
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,026
But you can't lie here all day.

155
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,360
Why not?

156
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,820
Good morning, Elsa.

157
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,155
Good morning.

158
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,158
I wish you would explain
to your father.

159
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,035
Is that my new pin?

160
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,204
- Pretty, I think.
- Off with it.

161
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,956
- I thought we were friends.
- So did I.

162
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,752
But then you let him come in here
before I've washed my face.

163
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,631
Ooh.
I am going to crack.

164
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,927
Curiously enough, you look very
appetizing, even with an unwashed face.

165
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,179
Thank you, darling.

166
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,224
Ooh! I have cracked.

167
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,017
- Where?
- Here.

168
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,478
Oh, now I'm getting peely.

169
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,605
I'll be ugly. You'll hate me.

170
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,398
I can't stand that moaning.

171
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:18,651
- Where do you think you're going?
- To sleep in the sea.

172
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,320
Brilliant. You sleep there,
I'll sleep here.

173
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,198
- You can't go back to sleep.
- Raymond, no.

174
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,700
You be careful.
She is sunburned.

175
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,630
Raymond?

176
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,181
Oh!

177
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:54,687
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

178
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,106
96, 97, 98, 99, a hundred.

179
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,608
Now the rain from heaven,
if you please.

180
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,571
None left.
You'll have to go in yourself.

181
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,656
It's marvelous, Raymond.

182
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,409
It's like swimming
in cool velvet.

183
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,994
Velvet's always hot.

184
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,829
Cool silk, then.

185
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,206
You know where I'd like to be
right this minute?

186
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,958
Exactly where you are.

187
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,210
You are exactly right.

188
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:20,838
Hey, out of my way.
There's work to be done.

189
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:25,426
Look.
The lobster lady approaches.

190
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,846
Guess who?

191
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:34,018
Marvelous.
She really is a good sport.

192
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,352
She is.

193
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,854
I'm glad you like her.

194
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,482
It's easy. She's fun
and she's unpretentious.

195
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,527
I'm glad you scuttled
Yvonne Marie before summer.

196
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,529
I never would have
brought Yvonne Marie here.

197
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,865
If you met her in April instead
of November, you would have.

198
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,951
Yvonne Marie is a winter girl.
That's why I met her in November.

199
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:55,164
I would kiss you for the umbrella,
Raymond, but you are in the sun.

200
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,250
I mixed three of those
lotions in one jar, Elsa.

201
00:15:58,334 --> 00:15:59,460
Brilliant.

202
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,462
I don't guarantee
they'll stop you from peeling.

203
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:05,633
I'm in no condition
to ask for a guarantee on anything.

204
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,136
All the way down here,
I've been brain-rattling.

205
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,221
- Seriously?
- Yes.

206
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:16,435
Cecile, which would you
rather have, jewels or furs?

207
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,062
Neither.

208
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,814
Jewelry is supposed to be
a good investment,

209
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,776
and, of course, you can
wear it all year round,

210
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,654
but furs feel so good
under bare feet.

211
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,156
Elsa, dear, are you
planning another birthday?

212
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,326
No, and I'm not
being hinty, either.

213
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,536
I was just wondering.

214
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,706
You see, when we go
to the casino Friday night.

215
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,044
Oh, I look like
a piece of old wallpaper.

216
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,922
And I win
a lot of money again.

217
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,757
Where is my comb?

218
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,760
There might be one
in the pocket of this shirt.

219
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,763
After all,
I won quite a bit last Friday,

220
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,933
and if I win quite a bit
this Friday-Thank you.

221
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,268
You still haven't opened
your letter, Raymond.

222
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,356
Well, I was wondering what I ought
to give myself for a present.

223
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,191
What happens if you lose?

224
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,569
But I never lose, Raymond.
You know that.

225
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,196
I can't.

226
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,659
That horoscope Cecile got for me
says I was born lucky and...

227
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,870
Where is she going?

228
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,921
Will he drown?

229
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,548
No, of course not, darling.

230
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,550
What makes you think
it's a he?

231
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,468
Why else would she run?

232
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,852
- You all right?
- I'm fine, thanks.

233
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:42,604
- My, but you're polite.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

234
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,231
Need some help?

235
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:47,484
- May I tie her onto your float?
- Sure. I'll help.

236
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,739
- My mother has a house on
the other side of the rocks.
- Oh?

237
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,824
I'm spending my vacation there.

238
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,328
- Vacation from what?
- Law school.

239
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,080
Oh.

240
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,416
Do you really mean
to be a lawyer?

241
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,334
Why else go to law school?

242
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:08,922
Well, one has to do something
until one reaches a certain age.

243
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,883
One has to prepare
for the future.

244
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,926
- Oh, I'm preparing.
- How?

245
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,387
By learning how
to have a good time.

246
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:16,930
But that's not a very...

247
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,391
You're a terribly serious
person, aren't you?

248
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:21,351
Yes, I am serious.

249
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,603
How marvelous.

250
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:23,937
Why?

251
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,939
I don't know
any serious people.

252
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,441
How peculiar.

253
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,569
That's my father there
with a friend... of ours.

254
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,071
- Yes, I know.
- You do? How?

255
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,241
- Oh, you've seen us at the casino.
- No.

256
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,328
No, you're too serious to go there.
In the village?

257
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,330
No. I've never seen any of you.

258
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,832
You've heard about us.
That's it, isn't it?

259
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,168
You've heard about those
wicked people from Paris.

260
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,962
- I'm from Paris.
- You heard and were intrigued.

261
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,672
You're corruptible.

262
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,509
I'm just interested in people,
that's all.

263
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,512
Well, it was very nice of you
to help me.

264
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,514
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

265
00:18:58,597 --> 00:18:59,807
You didn't.

266
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,558
Or shock you.

267
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,977
- If you'd like to come sailing someday, I-
- I'd love it.

268
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,855
- But I don't know how to sail.
- I'll teach you.

269
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,233
I should think you could do
with a lesson yourself.

270
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,985
I'm an excellent sailor.
The mast broke.

271
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,320
- Come on.
- Where?

272
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,406
Don't you want to meet
the wicked people from Paris?

273
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,582
Do you think I upset him?

274
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,126
You hop from one subject to
another like a roulette ball.

275
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,338
- Upset who?
- That sailor boat boy.What's his name?

276
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,798
Oh, Philippe.

277
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,969
Oh, it's torture to wear clothes
with a sunburn.

278
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,304
I think I did upset him.

279
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,515
Was I too open about us?

280
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,852
I don't think he needed quite so
much help in adding one and one.

281
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,813
Anyway, he's brilliantly cute.

282
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,065
Why didn't Cecile ask him to dinner?

283
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,525
She did. For tomorrow night.

284
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,694
I would have asked him for tonight.

285
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,320
I'm sure you would have.

286
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,030
Why waste time?

287
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:00,534
Monsieur, this was found
in the pocket of your shirt.

288
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,827
Oh, thank you.

289
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,997
- Could I have more coffee, please?
- Yes, mademoiselle.

290
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:10,002
Poor dear thinks she's being insulting
with that “mademoiselle”

291
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,461
I love it.

292
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,131
I'm not old enough
to be madam, am I?

293
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,551
- Cecile.
- I'm listening to the crickets.

294
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,888
But they only say the same thing
over and over.

295
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:24,558
I read they make that noise
by rubbing their legs together.

296
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,435
What a thought.

297
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:29,062
I have a surprise.
Company is coming.

298
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,064
Brilliant.
Anybody I know?

299
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,566
Anne Larsen.

300
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,359
This dress is one of her designs.

301
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,528
- Corning here? When?
- Next week.

302
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:39,239
Raymond,
is Anne Larsen married?

303
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:40,616
She's divorced. Why?

304
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:43,076
- How old is she?
- She's older than you are.

305
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,953
She was my mother's
best friend.

306
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:48,123
Oh. She must be
a very lovely lady.

307
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,667
Elsa, your thoughts
are so hard to follow.

308
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,669
Be careful of my back.

309
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,339
Oh, I just have to get out
of this dress.

310
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,679
Your, um, crickets
are having a cocktail party.

311
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,766
- Raymond...
- Now, please don't bawl me out.

312
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,726
- May I ask a question?
- No.

313
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,604
- What made you invite Anne down here?
- I thought you liked Anne.

314
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,942
I do, very much,
but we hardly ever see her anymore.

315
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,443
I see her all the time.

316
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,779
Occasionally, and at large parties.

317
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:22,324
The last time we had a nice long chat
at a comparatively small cocktail party.

318
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,659
Oh.

319
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:24,993
What does that mean?

320
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:28,163
I know you and the invitations
you hand out at cocktail parties.

321
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,791
To be absolutely honest,
I completely forgot I'd invited her.

322
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,044
You're awful. How did you
happen to ask her, anyway?

323
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,338
Well, she was looking
particularly attractive,

324
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,508
and she's always seemed
so aloof and self-assured.

325
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:42,803
I should think the last thing Anne would want
is to spend her vacation with us.

326
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,763
How did you get her to accept?

327
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,723
Hasn't anyone ever told you
that I'm charming?

328
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:49,226
- Everyone but Anne.
- Well, you should ask her now.

329
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:53,563
I started off by reminding her that she's practically
your godmother and hasn't seen you for two years.

330
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,148
I can hear it all.

331
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:58,193
“You know, Anne,
Cecile is no longer a child.

332
00:21:58,276 --> 00:21:59,695
She's a young girl now.

333
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,030
I try to be both parents to her,

334
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,241
but she needs the help
of a woman, Anne,

335
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,742
and the women I know...”

336
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:09,413
That's marvelous. I should be
taking lessons from you.

337
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,708
Raymond?
Did you tell her about Elsa?

338
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,292
Elsa?

339
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:15,877
Oh, Raymond.

340
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:19,131
I don't think I knew Elsa
was coming when I asked Anne.

341
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,509
Anyway, Anne said she'd think it over
and let me know and-Oh, dear.

342
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:25,887
Raymond!
Which room is Anne going to have?

343
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,557
I thought I'd give her mine.

344
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,644
- That's all right.
I'm going to sleep in the bathhouse.
- No, I'll sleep there.

345
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,608
No. The three ladies up here. The
gentleman down there. It's much better.

346
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:39,484
It's surprising for you to worry about appearances.
I'm a bundle of surprises tonight.

347
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,820
You're impossible,
and so is the situation.

348
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:47,242
Anyway, she's arriving Monday, so you can either
spank me, walk out on me, or help me pull it off.

349
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,662
- You know I'll help you.
- I suspected you might.

350
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,248
You're such a fake.

351
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:56,460
Oh, it's such wonderful fun
to have you for a daughter.

352
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,045
Mmm.

353
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,466
Hey, what's the matter?

354
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,177
I don't want it to stop.
Even.

355
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:11,516
But suddenly, somehow, I knew it would
stop, that our happy days were numbered.

356
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:37,000
That was a Tuesday.
Anne was due the following Monday.

357
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,169
Six more days.

358
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:42,422
I remember thinking seven
would have been lucky.

359
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:45,509
It was very hot
the day Anne was to arrive.

360
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,970
My father and Elsa
went to meet her at the station.

361
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,687
They're back.

362
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,790
Anne!

363
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,502
Welcome.

364
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,462
Thank you, Cecile.

365
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,718
Oh...
Are you that grown up?

366
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:32,848
- Really welcome.
- And, really, thank you.

367
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:38,728
- Which way?
- Terrace first, so you can see the view.

368
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:44,359
- How did your new collection go?
- Extremely well.

369
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:48,655
But I wish I could have found some
material the color of this water.

370
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:52,742
Do you know I spent my honeymoon
by the sea 12 years ago?

371
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,871
Did you like it?
I mean the place.

372
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:59,374
Yes, I liked both it and the place,

373
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:02,335
although it wasn't nearly
as lovely as this.

374
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,964
Do you know I had quite a debate
with myself before coming down here?

375
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,883
I'm delighted I lost.

376
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,843
I'll fetch your things.

377
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,722
What's the matter,
Cecile?

378
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,473
Nothing. Why?

379
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,976
- You're embarrassed.
- There's nothing, Anne.

380
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,061
All right.
May I take a guess?

381
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:24,024
You're annoyed that Raymond isn't on
hand to spread a red welcome carpet.

382
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:25,901
Oh, he's spreading it,
with ﬂowers,

383
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,153
only he's spreading it
at the station.

384
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,864
- But I wired I was driving.
- You wired?

385
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:34,576
Oh, yes. You know I wouldn't
decide to drive and not send word.

386
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:36,786
Now, where do you suppose
that telegram is?

387
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,164
In one of his pockets, unopened.

388
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:42,334
Albertine
I mean, Leontine.

389
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:46,379
Slight maid problem.
Some weird sisters rotate working for us.

390
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,673
Weird? How?

391
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:52,385
Every week, one or the other is
suddenly stricken with some odd malady.

392
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:53,678
Maybe it's us.

393
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,222
- Yes, mademoiselle?
- Oh, Leontine.

394
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:59,267
Leontine has a bad liver.
I am her sister, Claudine.

395
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:02,520
Oh. Well, Claudine,
did a telegram come today?

396
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,522
I handed it to monsieur myself.

397
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,024
Didn't he read it?

398
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,235
Do you know him, madam?

399
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:11,404
There are some bags by my car.
Would you please take them to my room?

400
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:12,948
Yes, madam.

401
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,826
- Where is my room?
- We can go this way.

402
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,411
Poor Raymond.

403
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,789
For once, he's the victim
of his own irresponsibilities.

404
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:24,167
- It serves him right.
- Oh, no. Not on such a hot day.

405
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:27,170
Oh, how I'd love to be able
to resist opening telegrams,

406
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,089
to not answer phones,

407
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,216
to just do exactly
what I intend to do here.

408
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,592
- What?
- Nothing.

409
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,430
Oh, what a lovely room.

410
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:42,394
Raymond picked the ﬂowers himself, and cut
them himself, and even arranged them himself.

411
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,937
Isn't he sweet?

412
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,107
Oh, he can be very endearing,
can't he?

413
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,362
Huh. At least the weird
sisters clean well.

414
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,740
You're looking wonderfully well.

415
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,951
I'm surprised and pleased.

416
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,452
Why surprised?

417
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,246
From Raymond's description,
I thought

418
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,749
That was in Paris.
I was worn out from studying.

419
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,377
How did you do with your examinations?

420
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,878
Flunked.

421
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,382
- Flunked?
- Flunked.

422
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,470
Would you like me to unpack
for you, madam?

423
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,097
No, thank you, Claudine.

424
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,599
- The box is for you.
- Oh, Anne.

425
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,354
- Are you studying now?
- During vacation?

426
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:29,482
Well, you're going to take
your examinations again in October.

427
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,735
Why? Raymond never
got a diploma.

428
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,946
Yes, but he worked hard,
made quite a bit of money.

429
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,700
Well, if it's all gone I'm sure there'll
always be a man to take care of me,

430
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,994
and you don't need
a diploma for that.

431
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:49,002
I don't like vulgarities, Cecile,
even when they're funny.

432
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,004
I'm sorry.

433
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,173
The dress is marvelous.

434
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,883
It's really marvelous, Anne.

435
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:55,842
But?

436
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:58,011
No. The style is too.

437
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,555
Everything you design is perfect.
Everyone says so.

438
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,974
But you think
that's too young for you, hmm?

439
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,893
- Well...
- You're wrong, you know.

440
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:08,897
A more sophisticated style would only
make you look younger, more of a child.

441
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,732
I'm not a child.

442
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,860
Anne, you're not going
to make me study, are you?

443
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,363
I didn't know I could.

444
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,114
Well, you could.

445
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:23,870
Don't be so afraid of me.
I'm not here as your governess.

446
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,247
I'm not going to
make you do anything,

447
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:29,751
although I might try
to influence you a little.

448
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,544
Oh, even a scale...

449
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,713
Well, that's going
to ruin my appetite.

450
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,423
Oh, that's Raymond's.

451
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,675
Did Raymond give up
this room for me?

452
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,220
I offered to move out of my room,
but he wouldn't have it.

453
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:43,473
It seems odd in a villa this size
there are only two bedrooms.

454
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:46,017
- Oh, there are three.
- Three?

455
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:49,521
Yes, this one, and two upstairs.
Mine and Elsa's.

456
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:51,898
Elsa Mackenbourg.

457
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,360
I think you met her.
Not too bright, but a lot of fun.

458
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,906
Just what does he think I am?

459
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,750
He sleeps in the bathhouse
down at the beach.

460
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:05,537
He can sleep here tonight,
because I won't...

461
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,206
Or any other place else that he...

462
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,584
Cecile, would you mind
leaving me alone?

463
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,839
No.

464
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,469
Cecile?

465
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,388
Cecile?

466
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,056
Yes, Raymond.

467
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,516
She wasn't there.

468
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,518
Do you suppose
she fell out of the train?

469
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,019
She's here. She drove.

470
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:33,022
You see? I told you Philippe
didn't have an American car.

471
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,651
Must have been a cool 190 degrees in the shade.
I'm as limp as a piece of spaghetti.

472
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,403
Oh, my pathetic feet.

473
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,613
- Where is Anne?
- In her room.

474
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:45,076
- Do you think there's any point in
my taking these to her now?
- I wouldn't disturb her now.

475
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,786
- Oh?
- Yes.

476
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,538
- Is she, uh...
- Very.

477
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,123
Very what?

478
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,917
You two don't even need words.
The perfect marriage.

479
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,669
- How bad?
- Breakage.

480
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,045
Really bad.

481
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,464
Do you suppose
the setup...?

482
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,299
No.
She's too sophisticated.

483
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,176
Maybe the discovery
of occupied territory...

484
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,969
- Couldn't care less.
- So you think.

485
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,388
- So I know.
- Know what about Anne?

486
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:08,975
Anne is fine,
and delighted to be here.

487
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,477
Please forgive me.

488
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,520
I stood on that platform for hours
waving these things like an idiot child.

489
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,482
It was my fault.
I should have telephoned.

490
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,984
What's the difference? You're here, I'm here.
Cecile's here. We're all here.

491
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,320
I'm here.
I'm Elsa Mackenbourg.

492
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:23,156
- Sorry. I thought you knew each other.
- Not nearly as well as I'd like to.

493
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,033
- What a pretty dress.
- Oh, thank you.

494
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:27,702
It's not as pretty
as some of yours I've got.

495
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,120
They are just brilliant.

496
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:32,040
Well, you are very kind,
but the line of that suits you well.

497
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,876
The color is good
when I'm not half-human, half-peely.

498
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,754
- I have some wonderful lotion that will help you.
- Oh, brilliant.

499
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,214
Yes, it's on
the dressing table.

500
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:42,467
If you'll all excuse me, I'm going to
sink in that water and drown in the sun.

501
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,928
I'll show you the way,
Anne.

502
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:45,512
I can see the way,
Raymond.

503
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,597
Straight down.

504
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,475
I'm going to put that lotion on
right this minute.

505
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,771
If that woman says it will help,
it will help. She's brilliant.

506
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,817
- Amazingly good figure.
- Never mind that now.

507
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,861
- I thought you said... Said what?
- I thought she said...

508
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,072
Said she was leaving.
She started packing.

509
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:06,282
- What is going on?
- I haven't a clue.

510
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,909
We'd better find out.

511
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,458
Anne...

512
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:18,127
Anne...

513
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,172
Anne...

514
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:26,886
What's so funny?

515
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,845
Oh, your face.

516
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:30,807
I could almost see you
figuring out something to say.

517
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,935
It's not too easy.
I can assure you.

518
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,187
You see, when I invited you,
I had no idea that Elsa was...

519
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:37,772
Oh, Raymond, please,
no explanations.

520
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,315
- No, but I want to explain.
- Well, don't.

521
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,151
Explanations only make everything
much more complicated.

522
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,113
- They certainly do. Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

523
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:48,283
- I'm sorry, darling.
- Oh, as long as you're staying...

524
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:49,909
I don't know that I am.

525
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:52,495
- Well, I don't know where we are again.
- I'll tell you.

526
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,540
I got stupidly angry before
and decided to leave,

527
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,542
and then the prospect
of packing again

528
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,420
and looking for a hotel room after
that long drive was just too much.

529
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:03,256
- So you decided to stay.
- Mm-hmm. Overnight.

530
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:06,009
Then I thought well, if I'm
going to stay overnight...

531
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:11,306
- Then you might just as well
spend your whole holiday here.
- Yes, if I find that I like it.

532
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,477
She'll be gone in two days.

533
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,021
No. She'll stay.

534
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,773
How can you be so sure?

535
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:23,735
I know women.
I know how to make them like it.

536
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:26,070
Oh, you want her to stay?

537
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:28,489
Yes. Yes, I want her to stay.

538
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:30,867
She has an amazingly good figure.

539
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:37,665
Anne stayed, and we liked it,
all three of us,

540
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,084
and the maids as well.

541
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,003
She ran them.

542
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,963
She ran the house.

543
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,132
She ran us.

544
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:52,472
- This is my dance.
- It doesn't seem to be.

545
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,485
She made everything so easy for us

546
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:09,322
that we wondered how we had
ever managed without her,

547
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:12,533
and we made everything
such fun for her.

548
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,745
We did have fun then,

549
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:19,374
and everyone was so nice
to everyone else.

550
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:33,846
Anne...

551
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,598
Anne!

552
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:41,854
We thought you deserted us.
Never.

553
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,940
We ordered for you.

554
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,901
- Where's Elsa?
- She's dancing with Pierre Shube.

555
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,945
Pierre Shube? Ugh.

556
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,239
Oh, he's a marvelous dancer.

557
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,950
Or as Elsa would say:
“Brilliant.” “Brilliant.”

558
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:57,078
How can you all just sit
with that brilliant music?

559
00:33:57,161 --> 00:34:00,373
It's even made me forget
the last of my sunburn.

560
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,750
Where's your friend?
Leading the band.

561
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,592
Come on, let's get with it.

562
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:12,885
Oh, no, Elsa.

563
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,888
Oh, it's so easy, Raymond.
Really. Just wiggle.

564
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:19,392
Put it out here and put it back there and
put it out here and put it back there.

565
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,185
Oh!

566
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,866
Oh, look at them.
It's wonderful.

567
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,492
Come on, then.

568
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,536
Come on, Philippe.

569
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:42,165
- Oh, no, it's useless.
- If you can teach me to sail,
I can teach you to wiggle.

570
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,644
Put it out here
and put it back there.

571
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:47,188
Put it out here
and put it back there.

572
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:13,589
Wiggle.

573
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,049
Brilliant.

574
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:17,260
Wiggle, wiggle.

575
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,821
Oh, I'm getting dizzy.

576
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:41,617
- Better?
- Better.

577
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:36,213
Oh, it should have been
someone's birthday tonight.

578
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:37,590
- It was.
- Whose?

579
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,300
Anne's.

580
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:40,718
I feel as if it was.

581
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:43,971
What a lovely, lovely,
lovely evening.

582
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,682
- I thank you.
- And we thank you.

583
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,853
Oh, it seems as though you're
always having birthday nights here.

584
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:54,273
Well, not always.
It's really rather recent.

585
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:59,612
- Cecile, isn't it time you were in bed?
- Oh...

586
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,198
I think it's time
we were all in bed.

587
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,199
Oh, Anne...

588
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,534
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Anne.

589
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,456
- Good night, Raymond.
- Good night.

590
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,794
Good night, darling.

591
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:16,420
Very funny.

592
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,685
Why do they fall off so much?

593
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,021
Anne never skied
before this summer.

594
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:17,857
I'm beginning to think
he makes her fall off.

595
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:25,448
All that fooling around
in the water...

596
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:29,660
Even I could get back up
on skis quicker.

597
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:33,080
And this sudden interest he has
in going to the market.

598
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,541
Every time she goes, he goes.

599
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:39,545
Yesterday, it took all afternoon
to buy two chickens.

600
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:43,591
Now, don't you tell me it takes one
whole afternoon to buy two chickens.

601
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:45,593
They weren't even
very good chickens, either.

602
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:48,345
Elsa, they've known each other
15 years.

603
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:51,015
With your father, nobody's safe.

604
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:54,226
Anne could never be seriously interested
in a man like Raymond.

605
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,312
I know Raymond, Cecile,

606
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:59,065
and if a man finds the right way
at the right moment...

607
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:00,232
Look.

608
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:03,694
No, I'm going to...

609
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:11,202
My horoscope knows more
than your law books.

610
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:16,165
It says tonight is my night, and I'm going to
win at the casino like something demented.

611
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:17,750
Bravo.

612
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:22,379
There is a new moon, and the casino is
starting a new game tonight-the craps.

613
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:24,006
Oh!

614
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,093
When did your eager little fingers
learn to hold dice?

615
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:31,388
Well, there was this American
named Lucky something...

616
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:33,724
I can see it all.

617
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:36,811
I don't know. There isn't a
three or seven in today's date.

618
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,771
Seven times two is 14.

619
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,440
- But today is the 15th.
- Not in China.

620
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,316
Oh!

621
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:45,569
There's nothing
like this Chinese champagne.

622
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:47,029
Or French laundry.

623
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,824
- You're getting giggly.
- Yes.

624
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:53,661
If we don't go to the casino now,
you'll fall fat on your ﬂaces.

625
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,621
Fat on your “ace, my dear.

626
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,832
Oh, no, {at on your “ace,
my dear.

627
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:00,292
- After you.
- After you. Oh, come on.

628
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:30,489
You must have driven
like a maniac.

629
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,748
Eleven!

630
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,959
Seven. You won, madam.

631
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:47,423
- My dear, may I ride on you?
- Tonight is my night. Ride away.

632
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:50,968
Baby needs shoes.

633
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:55,222
- Seven again.
- Oh!

634
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:58,851
Cecile, it's jewels and furs
for everybody.

635
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,561
Jewels, jewels.

636
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,646
- One card.
- Three and one.

637
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,524
- Have none of you any sporting blood?
- Mother.

638
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,610
Hello, Philippe.
Cecile, my dear.

639
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:09,278
What are you
doing here, Mother?

640
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,947
I found a new game,
and it enchants my blood.

641
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,575
And this vital little friend of yours-
Or is she a friend of your father's?

642
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:17,036
It doesn't matter.
She's brilliant.

643
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,998
Marvelous mind.
Brain of a mathematical genius.

644
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:23,125
- Who, Elsa?
- She never loses.

645
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,378
You see?

646
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:29,089
Here and here,
and this part here,

647
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:32,509
and here and here and here.

648
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:43,395
Victory.
Victory.

649
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,981
Brilliant.
Brilliant.

650
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:48,692
A very old friend, Pablo de L'Amo.

651
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:50,069
Hello, querida.

652
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:52,696
Hello, querido.
Hello from America.

653
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,157
Not North America,
South America.

654
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:01,497
Drinks, querido. Drinks and champagne.
Champagne and drinks.

655
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,540
He's a wee bit tipsy-poo.

656
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:05,292
He is very drunky-poo.

657
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:07,628
Very drunk
because I'm very rich.

658
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,256
Very rich
because I'm very smart.

659
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:14,760
Very smart because
I made it all myself in... in...

660
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,846
My beautiful Elsa,
what did I make it in?

661
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,265
Money!

662
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:20,599
Money.

663
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:23,686
He's drunk on champagne,
lam drunk on gambling.

664
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:26,772
You two aren't drunk on anything.
That's not very brilliant.

665
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:28,482
Not brilliant at all.

666
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:31,360
- Where is Raymond?
- Dancing, probably.

667
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:36,699
Brilliant girl, brilliant.
And very right.

668
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:38,951
You two are not drunk
on anything.

669
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,452
Very bad.

670
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:43,497
To live, you must be
drunk on something.

671
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:48,627
Love, money, success, failure,
even whiskey, but something.

672
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,421
You may be drunk,
but you're right.

673
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:52,464
Of course, I'm right.
I'm rich.

674
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:54,717
Or maybe
it's the other way around.

675
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:57,553
- Do you always have such a good time?
- Always.

676
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,972
Except when I'm home
in America.

677
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,432
Not North America.

678
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:02,516
South America.

679
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,019
You tell someone you're rich
and from America,

680
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:08,147
and they always think
you are from Texas.

681
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:10,566
They are not dancing.

682
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,234
They are not dancing anywhere.

683
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,361
My beautiful girl.

684
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:17,281
You are very beautiful.

685
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:20,701
Also, you are very sunburned.

686
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:22,703
Also, you are very peeling.

687
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:24,788
Oh, be quiet, Pablo.

688
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:26,582
I couldn't find them anyplace.

689
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,459
Drink your champagne, Elsa.

690
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,836
Drink my champagne, Elsa.

691
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,921
Lucky in cards,
unlucky in...

692
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:35,674
Oh, no, you're too beautiful
to be unlucky.

693
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:38,000
- Shall I go look for them?
- Stay with Elsa. I'll look.

694
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,764
Anne isn't used to so much champagne.
She probably needed air.

695
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,515
Stop worrying, Elsa.

696
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,892
Stop worrying, Elsa.

697
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,894
Isn't used to
so much champagne?

698
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:49,021
She can drink like a man.

699
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,522
Then I want to meet her.

700
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:52,941
Oh, be still, Pablo.

701
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:15,297
But it is summer, Raymond,

702
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:19,468
and I am as suspicious of summer
as I am of you.

703
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:21,470
You said
I behave like a little boy.

704
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,223
How can you be suspicious
of a lost little boy?

705
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,683
Easily. He likes to play
with girls too much.

706
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,727
That's perfectly true... until now.

707
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:30,896
Oh, now you're serious,
I suppose?

708
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,898
From the moment you arrived,
I've been serious.

709
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:35,609
No, from the moment I arrived,
you've been campaigning.

710
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:36,974
- Well...
- And what about Elsa?

711
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:38,862
- Elsa?
- Mm-hmm.

712
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:40,614
You know how I think of Elsa.

713
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,991
- As a playmate for Cecile?
- Exactly.

714
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:47,037
- And I could never think of you
as just a playmate.
- Not even for you?

715
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:49,540
No, the moment
I stop joking, you start.

716
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:52,126
Yes, but that's what you want
though, isn't it?

717
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:55,003
A playmate?
Someone to have fun with?

718
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:59,633
I do have fun with you, and that's
a long way from being all I want.

719
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:02,428
And we've been
over and over this.

720
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:04,263
I know.

721
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:09,476
Raymond, I cannot be casual.

722
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,020
I've never been
less casual in my life.

723
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,816
Then why am I still so frightened?

724
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:17,317
I don't know.

725
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:20,320
I'm often frightened when
I want something very badly.

726
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:22,114
And I want you.

727
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:25,200
I've never wanted any woman
the way I want you.

728
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:33,500
Oh...

729
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,719
No, Raymond.

730
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:45,387
Raymond, no.

731
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:53,770
Part of me was angry.
Part of me was happy.

732
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:55,981
All of me was excited.

733
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:58,942
Raymond had brought a blond girl
to the seashore,

734
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:00,527
made her go out in the sun,

735
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:02,529
and then
when she was a mess of peeling,

736
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:05,032
dropped her like a hot lobster.

737
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:09,578
It was unfair,
yet even while I was angry at him,

738
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:14,124
I was proud that he had gotten
the unattainable Anne.

739
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,502
How long would it last?

740
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:19,588
Well, how long did Elsa last?

741
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:22,257
How long did any of them last?

742
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:23,967
Anne wasn't feeling well.

743
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:26,386
My father had to take her home.

744
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,305
They have gone?

745
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:30,516
Yes.
How about a drink?

746
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:32,559
- No, thank you.
- No, thank you.

747
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:34,645
Would you like
to dance?

748
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:36,146
No, thank you.

749
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,650
She was awfully sick, Elsa.
She ruined that beautiful dress.

750
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:42,694
It was a horrible,
frumpy dress.

751
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:44,655
We were all so happy.

752
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:46,073
So happy-

753
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:47,824
We can still be happy, Elsa.

754
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:50,285
- No, we can't.
- No, we can't.

755
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:52,329
Oh, be still, Pablo.

756
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,206
Come on, Elsa.
We'll take you home.

757
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:57,376
I have no home.
I'm not going back there.

758
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:59,211
Elsa, be reasonable.

759
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,880
I will not be treated
like a wife.

760
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:05,133
Pablo will find me a hotel.

761
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:07,553
I'll buy you a hotel.

762
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:12,140
Good-bye, Philippe.
You liked me, didn't you?

763
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:14,726
I still do, Elsa.

764
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,938
We were good friends,
weren't we?

765
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,731
I'll see you, Elsa.

766
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:21,275
Never.

767
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:23,402
Never again.

768
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:25,320
Never again.

769
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:32,244
Poor Elsa. I feel as though
I were losing a good friend.

770
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,329
I am confused.

771
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:36,248
- You know what I'd like to do?
- What?

772
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:40,586
I'd like to go someplace alone with you
and get very drunky-poo.

773
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:43,839
Philippe, you'll be a credit
to your mother yet.

774
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:56,435
Good morning,
mademoiselle.

775
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:57,478
Good morning, Albertine.

776
00:48:57,561 --> 00:48:59,021
Oh...

777
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:10,866
Holy Buddha!

778
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,118
You are Albertine.

779
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:28,967
Come and sit with us.

780
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:32,763
Well... appearances would indicate
that you stopped off for a nightcap.

781
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:34,306
A whole hat.

782
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:35,682
Is that ice cream?

783
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,934
- It's vanilla. Her hangover cure.
- Oh.

784
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,603
- It works.
- Good morning, Cecile.

785
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:41,104
Good morning, Raymond.

786
00:49:41,188 --> 00:49:42,481
Good morning, Cecile.

787
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:43,899
Good morning, Anne.

788
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:50,697
You both look so mysterious,
as if you had a secret.

789
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:52,407
- Well...
- Well...

790
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:55,744
- Have you got a cigarette, darling?
- I'll get one.

791
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:59,081
No, no, don't bother,
because I don't really want one.

792
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:01,625
We would like
to ask you something.

793
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,919
If it's about Elsa,
she's in a hotel.

794
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:05,879
Some South American
was taking care of her.

795
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:09,007
- Well, no, no, it's not that.
- What, then?

796
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:11,093
Well...

797
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:13,553
your father and I
would like to get married.

798
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:15,639
We'd like it very much.

799
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,017
Oh.

800
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:22,562
Well, it's a good idea.
It's a very good idea.

801
00:50:22,646 --> 00:50:24,189
Whew.
I'm glad that's over.

802
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:27,275
- I told you she'd be pleased.
- Of course I am.

803
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,151
I wasn't sure.

804
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:31,780
- But you never believe me.
- Yes, I do. I do. I do.

805
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:35,409
Now that the approval's official,
we'll celebrate.

806
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:38,120
Champagne? Or would you
rather have more ice cream?

807
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:39,830
May I have both?

808
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:42,124
You can have
anything you want.

809
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:46,878
You are pleased?

810
00:50:46,962 --> 00:50:48,588
Yes.

811
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:50,549
But confused?

812
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:54,386
No, it's just hard for me
to smile too much with this head.

813
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:57,305
- Is that really all?
- Yes.

814
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:02,894
Does our getting married
seem strange to you, or just ridiculous?

815
00:51:02,978 --> 00:51:04,896
Not ridiculous at all.

816
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,940
But strange?

817
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:09,067
A little.

818
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:10,694
Why?

819
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:12,487
Oh, I...

820
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:16,158
Say it. Say anything, Cecile.
I want you to.

821
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,748
I have to kind of push everything around
to think of Raymond married.

822
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:25,417
You mean you didn't want him
to marry again?

823
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,462
No, I mean
I didn't think he wanted to.

824
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:32,215
But if he does, I do.
If he's glad, I'm glad.

825
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:36,303
Oh! That makes me so happy.

826
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:39,514
You know, I was rather
frightened of you.

827
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:41,266
Of me? Why?

828
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:44,102
I was afraid of
your being frightened of me.

829
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:46,396
I was, until just this minute.

830
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,774
- Well, never be again.
- I won't.

831
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:51,526
I've told Albertine the news.

832
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,028
That is Albertine, isn't it?

833
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:54,362
Yes.

834
00:51:54,446 --> 00:51:57,783
Anyway, I told her the news,
and she's happier than we are.

835
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:00,660
I think we've seen
the last of her sisters.

836
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:03,497
You see,
you make everybody happy.

837
00:52:03,622 --> 00:52:05,457
- Doesn't she, Cecile?
- Yes.

838
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:13,715
Did I really believe that?

839
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:16,718
Well, at least I tried to,

840
00:52:16,802 --> 00:52:20,138
and I tried to live
as though it were true,

841
00:52:20,222 --> 00:52:24,684
as though the subtle, but swift
changes Anne made in our daily life

842
00:52:24,768 --> 00:52:26,937
made me happy too.

843
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:31,191
It isn't that I don't believe
your father has changed.

844
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:33,610
It's that I want too much
to believe it.

845
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:36,947
What possible difference could
a change in Raymond mean to you?

846
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:41,076
If he changes, you change. If he can be
happy with one person, then maybe...

847
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:42,828
Raymond is happy with Anne.

848
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:45,330
It's different than it was
with Elsa or with...

849
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:49,167
He loves Anne, and he does want
the kind of life she wants.

850
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:51,002
You've seen them.
You know.

851
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:53,797
Belonging to one person
can make you terribly happy.

852
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,423
Anne is different, too.

853
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:58,009
She looks softer.

854
00:52:58,093 --> 00:52:59,803
She moves easier.

855
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:02,222
In the morning, she seems...

856
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:03,932
Seems how?

857
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:07,060
As though she...

858
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:09,813
had the most wonderful secret
in the world.

859
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:13,733
I wish I walked
the way she walks now.

860
00:53:13,817 --> 00:53:16,111
I wish I had the look she has.

861
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:17,779
I wish...

862
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,035
You said we weren't
to do this anymore.

863
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:25,579
I don't care.

864
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:33,628
Cecile!

865
00:53:40,677 --> 00:53:44,014
I think perhaps
you had better go, Philippe.

866
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:46,057
I'm afraid you got the wrong impression.
There wasn't...

867
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:48,143
I think you'd better go.

868
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:00,822
You should realize that such
diversions can end up in a hospital.

869
00:54:00,906 --> 00:54:04,284
We were only kissing, Anne. That
won't end up in any hospital.

870
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,244
Please don't see him again,
Cecile.

871
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:08,496
What if I say I love him?

872
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:13,376
I don't think you do, darling.

873
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,964
Love doesn't depend on that sort of thing,
nor is it the only way to express it.

874
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:20,759
But I enjoy Philippe
and I want to see him.

875
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:24,387
And I feel a great responsibility
towards you now,

876
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:26,932
and I cannot allow you
to ruin your life.

877
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:28,642
Are you ruining yours?

878
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:34,606
Your father and I
are going to be married.

879
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:36,900
Also, I am not 17.

880
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:40,278
Seventeen now isn't what it was
when you were 17.

881
00:54:40,362 --> 00:54:43,823
I'm not a child, Anne,
and I won't be treated like one.

882
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:47,077
I don't want you to see
Philippe again, Cecile.

883
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,120
Anyway, you will have
your studying to do,

884
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:52,165
and that will keep you busy
in the afternoons.

885
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:55,377
My father tells me what to do,
not you.

886
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:10,642
I suppose she told you.

887
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:14,229
Oh, she's constantly telling me
and I adore listening.

888
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:17,273
- You know what I mean.
- Everybody's so full of meaning,
I never know what anybody means.

889
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:19,275
Stop joking.

890
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,986
I'm sorry.

891
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:23,488
We were only kissing,
and Anne thought...

892
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:26,658
Oh, darling, I didn't.

893
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:30,412
I simply feel it would be a good idea
if she stopped seeing Philippe for a time

894
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:33,081
and studied for her philosophy
examination instead.

895
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:34,541
Couldn't she do both?

896
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:37,002
I mean, Philippe
is a well-behaved boy and...

897
00:55:37,085 --> 00:55:39,671
Not too good a sense of humor,
but he's nice. I like him.

898
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:43,216
Well, Cecile is nice and I like her, but they
have absolute freedom and nothing to do.

899
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,218
We have a great deal to do.

900
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,638
We play tennis and go sailing
and swimming and skin-diving.

901
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:51,057
- Healthy things.
- Physical things.

902
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:54,436
If anything should happen,
you couldn't really blame them.

903
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:56,396
Yes, I see what you mean.

904
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,106
You do?

905
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:00,108
But, darling, you really
should do some work.

906
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:03,111
You don't want a failure in philosophy
and have to take the whole thing over again.

907
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:05,864
I couldn't care less,
and neither could you.

908
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:11,369
Cecile, would it be so hard
to study just for a few weeks?

909
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:13,204
Yes. Very hard.

910
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:14,330
Cecile...

911
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:17,709
Are you siding with her or with me?
It's not a question of sides.

912
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,044
Isn't it?

913
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:22,380
I want to see Philippe, and I don't
want to be cooped up studying.

914
00:56:22,464 --> 00:56:25,008
Anne wants me to study
and not see Philippe.

915
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,010
Which shall it be?

916
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:30,221
Darling, because I love Anne, it doesn't
mean that I love you any the less.

917
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:32,307
That's not an answer.

918
00:56:33,683 --> 00:56:36,102
Well, I... I think
for the next few weeks,

919
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:38,646
you should study
and not see Philippe.

920
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:11,304
She's prim and prissy

921
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:14,974
and a prude
and a know-it-all and I hate her.

922
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:21,815
She's changed him.

923
00:57:21,898 --> 00:57:23,691
She'll change me.

924
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,570
She'll change everything.

925
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:31,116
I hate her.

926
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:33,535
I hate her. I hate her.

927
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:38,748
No, it isn't her fault
he doesn't love you anymore.

928
00:57:38,832 --> 00:57:40,917
It's yours.

929
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,005
You're spoiled and willful
and arrogant and lazy.

930
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:48,383
A mean little monster.

931
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,391
Anne had made me look at myself
for the first time in my life,

932
00:57:56,474 --> 00:58:01,020
and that turned me against her,
dead against her.

933
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:14,450
I'll be with you
in a moment, jacques.

934
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,958
I'm sorry.

935
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,334
I'm not angry.

936
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:25,295
Then why are you leaving?

937
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:27,297
I don't really know.

938
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,757
You go to a place,
you leave a place.

939
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:33,344
He... He's not for you.

940
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:34,596
Who is?

941
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:37,015
Not him, at any rate.

942
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:39,642
Where do you live, Hubert?

943
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:41,311
Where do I live?

944
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:43,062
You know where I live.

945
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:45,023
You know where live?

946
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:47,317
Limbo, with my father.

947
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,898
Oh, there's Jacques.

948
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,776
What happened? I thought
you weren't going to show up.

949
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:31,819
You know better than that.

950
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:34,322
Not this evening. This
evening, you're very peculiar.

951
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,324
Well, I'm a very peculiar girl.

952
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:38,368
Well, you're my girl,
aren't you?

953
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:40,620
Yes, Raymond. I'm your girl.

954
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,247
We have great fun,
don't we?

955
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,332
Yes, we have great fun.

956
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:47,669
Does he really still have fun?

957
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:50,129
I know he wants to desperately,

958
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:53,007
and I knew he wouldn't have
very much with Anne,

959
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:57,136
which was probably another reason
I decided to get rid of her.

960
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:02,642
How carefully, how seriously
I went about that decision.

961
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,769
What a little beast.

962
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,646
While pretending to study,

963
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:11,567
I actually spent days comparing
the contestants for my father,

964
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:13,861
comparing Anne and me,

965
01:00:13,945 --> 01:00:17,782
all our good points
against all our bad ones.

966
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,590
I meant to be fair,

967
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:38,428
but the score was against me...
definitely.

968
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:43,725
Anne was out.

969
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:46,644
How to get her out
might have been difficult

970
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:49,647
if the way, the trap,
had not been opened for me.

971
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,192
Come in, Albertine.

972
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:58,614
Elsa!
What's happened to you?

973
01:00:58,698 --> 01:01:00,950
I'm tan all over.

974
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:03,619
- Don't I look brilliant?
- Absolutely.

975
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:05,204
And a new dress?

976
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:08,166
Several new dresses
and shoes and bags.

977
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:09,625
From your gambling money?

978
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:13,129
No, from Pablo, for my birthday.

979
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:16,174
I thought you had that birthday
three months ago.

980
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:18,676
I did, but he was in America then.

981
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,095
South America.
Ole'!

982
01:01:22,263 --> 01:01:26,184
Pablo said to leave my old things here,
but I'm sentimental.

983
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,061
I packed everything myself.

984
01:01:28,186 --> 01:01:30,938
- How is Raymond?
- Miserable.

985
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:32,440
Really?

986
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:35,234
Well, he is,
but he doesn't know it yet.

987
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:37,487
She doesn't give him
a chance to know it.

988
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:38,863
She's very clever, Elsa.

989
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:40,239
Brilliant.

990
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:44,077
You don't know how clever.
She's got him to agree to marry her.

991
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,328
Marry?

992
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:47,955
- Raymond is going to marry?
- Yes.

993
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,667
- Well, it serves him right.
- How can you say such a thing?

994
01:01:51,793 --> 01:01:53,878
- He threw me out.
- You walked out.

995
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:57,215
He dumped me at the casino,
and no lady goes home alone.

996
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:59,175
Elsa, you had me and Philippe.

997
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,636
- I have my pride.
- And Pablo.

998
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:04,972
Oh, Pablo. He just drinks and
laughs and drinks and...

999
01:02:05,056 --> 01:02:06,474
Elsa, it's fate.

1000
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,476
I hate fate.
That stupid horoscope!

1001
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,145
Listen. I mean, it's fate that
you walked in here when you did.

1002
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:14,482
- I was just thinking about you.
- Really? What?

1003
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,943
I was thinking
how Raymond still loves you.

1004
01:02:17,026 --> 01:02:18,403
Oh, Cecile.

1005
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:20,905
Deep down, he still loves you
and you know it.

1006
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:24,325
Yes, he loves me so madly
he's going to marry Anne.

1007
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:27,537
It's the idea of marriage
that appeals to him, not Anne.

1008
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:28,871
You think so?

1009
01:02:28,955 --> 01:02:31,582
You know how he always wants
to try something new.

1010
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:33,334
But he has been married.

1011
01:02:33,418 --> 01:02:37,463
Yes, but so long ago
he's forgotten he didn't like it,

1012
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:39,924
and if he marries again,
he's ruined.

1013
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:42,051
- So are you.
- I know.

1014
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:44,303
I wish you wanted to help.

1015
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:46,264
What can I do?
It's too late.

1016
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:48,891
I walked out
when I should have stayed.

1017
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:51,227
- Where are you going?
- Back to Cannes.

1018
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:53,438
- Must you?
- No.

1019
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:55,231
Do you want to?

1020
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:57,567
No. I love Raymond.

1021
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:00,820
And I'd still be here if it weren't
for that scheming adventuress.

1022
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:04,866
Elsa, ask Philippe's mother
if you can stay with them.

1023
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:07,076
I know I can.
She thinks I'm brilliant.

1024
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:09,996
- But why?
- Say you don't have a place to stay.

1025
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,373
Yes, but why go at all?

1026
01:03:12,457 --> 01:03:13,791
I have an idea.

1027
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:17,253
It isn't completely worked out yet,
and there isn't time to explain.

1028
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:18,421
But, Cecile...

1029
01:03:18,546 --> 01:03:20,798
- Do you want Raymond back?
- You know I do.

1030
01:03:20,882 --> 01:03:22,467
Then hurry to Philippe's.

1031
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:24,635
- Do you have a car?
- Yes. Pablo was sweet enough-

1032
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:27,680
You drive, and I'll walk through
the woods and meet you there.

1033
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:29,640
Why don't you
come with me now?

1034
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:31,976
I don't want them
to see us together.

1035
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:34,103
Besides, I have to
work out my plan.

1036
01:03:34,187 --> 01:03:37,440
That means concentration,
and that means being alone.

1037
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:39,442
Now, hurry.
Go the back way.

1038
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:41,819
All right.

1039
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:43,905
Oh, Cecile?

1040
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,615
What now?

1041
01:03:45,698 --> 01:03:48,159
I feel so good.

1042
01:04:03,382 --> 01:04:04,759
Cecile...

1043
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,178
Cecile...

1044
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,846
Where are you going?

1045
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:10,723
For a walk in the woods.

1046
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:14,060
You've been working so hard. Why don't you relax?
Go and take a swim.

1047
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:15,728
- No, thank you.
- I'll come with you.

1048
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,605
The water's very watery today.

1049
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,106
I have to concentrate.

1050
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:21,609
I'm working out a problem
in philosophy.

1051
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:24,070
Oh, now, surely
philosophy can wait.

1052
01:04:24,153 --> 01:04:26,572
Not Pascal.
He's very demanding.

1053
01:04:26,656 --> 01:04:29,534
And you want me to meet
his demands, don't you?

1054
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:32,537
I am sure any man would wait
while you took a swim.

1055
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,372
Not this one.

1056
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:55,810
- Did Elsa tell-
- Yes!

1057
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:58,521
Let's get married.

1058
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,147
- It's an epidemic.
- I'm serious.

1059
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:02,066
You're only a boy.

1060
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:04,235
I only look like a boy.
I'm 25.

1061
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:05,319
Where's Elsa?
Did your mother...

1062
01:05:05,403 --> 01:05:07,530
I'm telling you I love you.
I'm proposing.

1063
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:09,865
I heard you the first time.

1064
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:12,743
Well, then, you didn't answer
because the answer is no.

1065
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:16,747
I didn't answer because Anne would answer
for me, and her answer would be no.

1066
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:18,749
Can't we get rid of Anne?

1067
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:21,210
Philippe, that's exactly
why I sent Elsa down here.

1068
01:05:21,294 --> 01:05:22,587
Then you do love me?

1069
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,881
I don't quite get the connection,
but, yes, I do.

1070
01:05:26,007 --> 01:05:29,176
- Now, where's Elsa?
- She's over there watching Mother play bridge.

1071
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,345
You know, she told Mother
she was an orphan.

1072
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:32,680
Why?

1073
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:34,682
She said she thought
it was a good touch.

1074
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:36,934
Everybody always
feels sorry for orphans.

1075
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:39,437
But, you know, as a matter of fact,
I feel rather sorry for Elsa.

1076
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,105
Why the change?

1077
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,774
Well, I didn't realize
that Anne was such an adventuress

1078
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:46,485
or that Elsa had so much sensitivity.

1079
01:05:46,569 --> 01:05:48,696
So much imagination,
you mean.

1080
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:56,704
Collect your tiny brain
and try and do better this time.

1081
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:01,417
One small diamante.

1082
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,251
Two clubs.

1083
01:06:02,335 --> 01:06:03,961
- Pass
- Pass?

1084
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:05,796
Pass.

1085
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,964
Two hearts.

1086
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:09,425
Three diamantes.

1087
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:10,676
Pass.

1088
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,802
Pass.

1089
01:06:11,886 --> 01:06:13,054
Pass.

1090
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:15,306
- Three hearts.
- Three hearts, huh?

1091
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:18,643
Now, my duck, we're on the brink
of a tantalizing abyss.

1092
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:20,811
Do I jump or not?

1093
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,355
Three hearts, huh?

1094
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,857
- What? What?
- Tune that thing up, Clamont.

1095
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:27,735
- She's only repeating your pathetic bid.
- Elsa. Elsa!

1096
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:30,446
Stop semaphoring, Philippe.
Either come in or out.

1097
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:31,947
I say jump.

1098
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:34,950
I'm with you. Come back at 5:00, darling.
My partner has to go.

1099
01:06:35,076 --> 01:06:37,703
- You and I will sweep the field.
- Okay.

1100
01:06:40,122 --> 01:06:41,582
- Where can we talk?
- My room.

1101
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,918
I can't wait to hear
your plan, Cecile.

1102
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,378
I'm all goose pimply.

1103
01:06:45,503 --> 01:06:47,296
- I don't like intrigue.
- I'm hot for it.

1104
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,674
You talk
about wanting to marry me.

1105
01:06:49,757 --> 01:06:51,008
What's that have
to do with your plan?

1106
01:06:51,092 --> 01:06:53,177
- Would Anne let me marry you?
- No.

1107
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,722
The plan concerns getting rid
of Anne, and Anne concerns us.

1108
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:59,308
- All right, but I still don't like it.
- I love it.

1109
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,353
- You haven't even heard it yet.
- Will you two be still?

1110
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:05,356
Now, the basic idea
is wildly simple.

1111
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:07,900
The details may take
a bit of working out.

1112
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:09,568
- Is that your room?
- Yes.

1113
01:07:09,652 --> 01:07:12,196
You two must pretend
to be madly in love with each other,

1114
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:15,908
and we have to arrange that my father
sees you together, and often.

1115
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:17,910
Jealousy,
the green-eyed monster.

1116
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:21,747
- Now, wait, Cecile.
- You wait, and let me explain.

1117
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:40,391
Krishnamara, aid me.

1118
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,852
Concentration is the secret.

1119
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:45,688
Exhale deeply.

1120
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:47,898
Exhale from the mind.

1121
01:07:49,817 --> 01:07:51,986
Exhale from the soul.

1122
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:58,492
Now, then, suppose I tell Elsa.

1123
01:07:58,576 --> 01:08:00,870
No, suppose I tell Philippe.

1124
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:03,372
-
- Go away, Albertine.

1125
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:05,207
It isn't Alber...

1126
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:09,044
Yoga. Hindu philosophy.

1127
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:21,849
I wasn't aware that Yoga
was part of your examination.

1128
01:08:25,019 --> 01:08:28,773
All those discussions
about your paper on Pascal

1129
01:08:28,856 --> 01:08:31,650
and how difficult
Spinoza was for you...

1130
01:08:33,736 --> 01:08:37,698
Cecile, have you actually
done any studying at all?

1131
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,663
Well, of course, in the end, it's your own
affair if you fail your examinations,

1132
01:08:44,747 --> 01:08:49,877
but it is another matter when you
lie to your father and to me.

1133
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:53,297
Why did you lie?

1134
01:08:56,967 --> 01:09:00,346
I really don't
understand you at all.

1135
01:09:03,265 --> 01:09:05,559
And you never will.

1136
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:11,769
I would like to apologize.

1137
01:11:11,852 --> 01:11:14,605
I sometimes forget
that you're still a child.

1138
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:19,318
Now, please don't let
that word offend you, Cecile.

1139
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:22,112
It's merely a short way of saying...

1140
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:25,658
well, that you're still young enough

1141
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:28,661
to pattern your behavior
after people older than you.

1142
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:32,206
You mean I'm not to blame
for behaving like Raymond?

1143
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:33,958
No, you're not,

1144
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:38,754
or for being inﬂuenced by the way
he used to live or the friends he-

1145
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:42,883
Well, I hope won't see
very much of from now on.

1146
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:44,969
The Lombards, for instance.

1147
01:11:45,052 --> 01:11:47,763
They telephoned from their yacht,
by the way, while you were out.

1148
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:50,474
They're taking us to dinner
and a nightclub on Tuesday.

1149
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:52,142
We have to go.

1150
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:53,852
He's your father's business partner.

1151
01:11:53,936 --> 01:11:55,980
I think they're very amusing.

1152
01:11:56,063 --> 01:11:57,940
At least, they always make me laugh.

1153
01:11:58,023 --> 01:12:02,069
There will be risque stories
deliberately in front of you,

1154
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:06,824
and Helen Lombard will make sly and
bitter jokes about her friends,

1155
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:10,619
and then compare Raymond's muscles
with her newest young chauffeur,

1156
01:12:10,703 --> 01:12:12,830
who is by way
of being a nephew,

1157
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:17,418
and Henri will confide in Raymond
about his latest girl, perhaps a model,

1158
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:19,920
while he rubs your knee
under the table,

1159
01:12:20,004 --> 01:12:23,173
your knee being
younger than mine.

1160
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:27,136
And in a few years, the newest
nephew-chauffeur will make off with the car,

1161
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:30,347
and the latest model
will be wearing Helen’s jewelry,

1162
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:33,726
and the friends will laugh at the
Lombards rather than at their jokes.

1163
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:36,353
At least they're having a good time now.

1164
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:37,896
Are they?

1165
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:41,567
Then why do they drink so much
and so often?

1166
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:45,070
Why are then never alone
with each other?

1167
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:48,198
In the end, their only memories
will be of hangovers.

1168
01:12:48,282 --> 01:12:50,909
I have another moral, Anne.

1169
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:54,496
If you can't accept people
as they are, give them up.

1170
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:56,457
Don't try to change them.

1171
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,293
Besides, it's usually too late.

1172
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:18,228
Why, you're almost
as strong as Rene.

1173
01:13:19,855 --> 01:13:21,148
Rene...

1174
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:24,068
Darling, Rene is
Helen's new chauffeur.

1175
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:25,486
And nephew.

1176
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:28,864
- On which side?
- On the left side. It's an American car.

1177
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:32,910
Wicked, but sweet. Don't you
think they're sweet, Henri?

1178
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:35,662
Young love in late fall...
Thank you.

1179
01:13:35,746 --> 01:13:39,166
And how does little Cecile feel about
her naughty father getting married?

1180
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:42,628
Little Cecile feels
like having a great big drink.

1181
01:13:42,711 --> 01:13:45,005
Of course.
That's what we're here for.

1182
01:13:45,089 --> 01:13:45,839
Waiter.

1183
01:13:45,923 --> 01:13:47,716
We were at a party
the other night.

1184
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:49,927
- Fantastic.
- Who's going to tell this story?

1185
01:13:50,052 --> 01:13:51,595
I am.

1186
01:13:51,678 --> 01:13:53,097
Waiter.

1187
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,540
You'll never believe the amount
of liquor that was consumed.

1188
01:13:55,557 --> 01:13:57,017
Raymond.

1189
01:13:57,101 --> 01:14:00,354
Isn't that Elsa Mackenbourg
over there?

1190
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:34,471
Hasn't she grown into
a beautiful trick?

1191
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:35,889
Who is the boy?

1192
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:37,224
Her nephew.

1193
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:38,600
Cecile...

1194
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:40,269
He's young enough.

1195
01:14:40,352 --> 01:14:43,063
Do you realize everywhere
we've been, there they are?

1196
01:14:43,147 --> 01:14:45,149
She's deliberately
ﬂaunting her achievement.

1197
01:14:45,232 --> 01:14:46,817
I prefer to rise above it.

1198
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,819
It's all so unimportant,
Raymond.

1199
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:50,362
It's disgraceful.

1200
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:52,364
That boy has
such a good face.

1201
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:53,907
And he's such a good driver.

1202
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:55,659
You're well rid of him.

1203
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:58,078
As a matter of fact,
it's indecent.

1204
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:06,503
Anne...

1205
01:15:10,841 --> 01:15:13,677
You look particularly
lovely tonight.

1206
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:19,850
Thank you.

1207
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:25,522
This is fun.
We ought to go for walks more often.

1208
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:28,066
- Those days are over.
- Nonsense.

1209
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:30,569
And your days with the Lombards
are over too.

1210
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:32,571
Are you putting me
out of business?

1211
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:35,073
I meant socially.
Anne doesn't like them.

1212
01:15:35,157 --> 01:15:36,575
Oh, she will in time.

1213
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:38,577
No, she won't.
You know Anne.

1214
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,954
- Why don't you like her?
- I do.

1215
01:15:41,038 --> 01:15:43,790
You may like her,
but you're always squabbling with her.

1216
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:46,543
You know, you're a little bit
like a mother-in-law.

1217
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:49,755
Well, mother-in-law
will just marry a little earlier,

1218
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:51,798
and that will solve
all the problems.

1219
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:53,550
You don't have to go that far.

1220
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:55,886
I exaggerate, and you know it,

1221
01:15:55,969 --> 01:16:00,849
but the truth is, Anne's way of living
is better than ours, and I have to face it.

1222
01:16:00,933 --> 01:16:02,309
Good. Then face it.

1223
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:05,145
It has depth and stability
and wholesomeness.

1224
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:07,940
Hey, you're deliberately making the
whole thing sound like a terrible bore.

1225
01:16:08,023 --> 01:16:09,441
It's the good life.

1226
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:11,443
Oh, come down off the pulpit.

1227
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:15,572
Now, we both know that your life with me has
not been suitable for your age or mine.

1228
01:16:15,656 --> 01:16:17,324
We've never been bored.

1229
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:18,992
Well, we're not
going to be bored now.

1230
01:16:19,076 --> 01:16:21,286
Anne's not asking us
to go into a convent.

1231
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:24,081
I just came out,
and you couldn't get in.

1232
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:26,291
That's your opinion,
but you know what I mean.

1233
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:28,502
All right, but if you want to
make her completely happy...

1234
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:29,670
I do.

1235
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:32,172
Then you have to give up
our old life completely.

1236
01:16:32,256 --> 01:16:35,259
Don't you think that after a while
we can sort of gradually ease into a...

1237
01:16:38,303 --> 01:16:40,305
Don't.

1238
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:42,015
Come on.

1239
01:16:54,069 --> 01:16:55,779
- That little tramp.
- Raymond...

1240
01:16:55,862 --> 01:16:57,114
Well, she is.

1241
01:16:57,197 --> 01:16:58,824
You threw her out.
She walked out.

1242
01:16:58,907 --> 01:17:01,201
You behaved abominably to her
and you know it.

1243
01:17:01,285 --> 01:17:03,328
Did you enjoy seeing her like that
with Philippe?

1244
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:06,248
- I don't love him anymore.
- I don't love her anymore. That's not the point.

1245
01:17:06,373 --> 01:17:09,793
- What is the point?
- The point is, well, it doesn't make any sense.

1246
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:11,795
With a boy, Cecile?
With a baby.

1247
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:13,964
- I found him attractive too.
- Attractive!

1248
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:16,008
- If I wanted her back...
- You couldn't.

1249
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:17,426
No?

1250
01:17:17,509 --> 01:17:19,428
Well, it's out
of the question anyway.

1251
01:17:19,511 --> 01:17:22,511
But you think I couldn't get her back
just because he's a few years younger.

1252
01:17:22,514 --> 01:17:24,558
What's this sudden enchantment
with these woods?

1253
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:26,643
Anne, how old am I?

1254
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:31,315
Old enough to marry me
next month, but just barely.

1255
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:08,435
Yoo-hoo!

1256
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,110
Elsa, what are you done up as?

1257
01:18:17,194 --> 01:18:18,695
Shh.

1258
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:22,282
Stop shushing. Honestly, you're
behaving like an amateur spy.

1259
01:18:22,366 --> 01:18:25,035
You could have telephoned
instead of sending this.

1260
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:27,496
I didn't want anyone to
recognize my voice.

1261
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:29,623
“All's well. Come.”
What does it mean?

1262
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:33,502
It means your plan
worked brilliantly.

1263
01:18:33,585 --> 01:18:38,048
Raymond telephoned me last night to say
he was madly sorry for what happened,

1264
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:41,593
and that he had behaved
like an absolute monster cad.

1265
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:43,553
Oh, it was heaven.

1266
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:48,350
He sort of rumbled a lot of
divinely sweet things in that way of his.

1267
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:54,272
You know, quietly, in a low, deep voice
as if he was suffering.

1268
01:18:54,356 --> 01:18:56,316
Mmm. It was shivery.

1269
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,692
I'm sure.

1270
01:18:57,776 --> 01:19:00,404
And he asked me
to meet him after lunch today

1271
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:02,781
to show I had no hard feelings
or anything.

1272
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:05,409
- Meet him where?
- He said not to tell a soul.

1273
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:07,285
He meant Philippe, not me.

1274
01:19:07,369 --> 01:19:08,578
I don't know.

1275
01:19:08,662 --> 01:19:11,081
Of course, he doesn't know
that you know that I...

1276
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:13,542
Elsa, where are you
supposed to meet him?

1277
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:16,503
- He said not to tell.
- Oh. Then, don't.

1278
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:18,380
But should I go?

1279
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:20,006
Meet him, don't meet him.

1280
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:22,175
Do whatever you want,
only don't ask me.

1281
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,594
- Cecile...
- It's getting out of hand.

1282
01:19:24,678 --> 01:19:28,098
I just wish I were a lot older
or a lot younger.

1283
01:19:35,856 --> 01:19:37,357
Oh.

1284
01:19:37,441 --> 01:19:40,861
Pig, pig, pig-
I ate like a pig.

1285
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:43,447
Sleepy?

1286
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:45,240
In a way.

1287
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:50,287
No. I have to work.

1288
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:52,622
Well, I have to go
and meet Lombard, anyway.

1289
01:19:52,706 --> 01:19:54,583
Lombard? Where
are you meeting him?

1290
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:56,793
His yacht's anchored
just around the point.

1291
01:19:56,877 --> 01:19:58,837
Why don't we all go?
It'd be fun.

1292
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,090
Because I simply must
get at those sketches.

1293
01:20:02,174 --> 01:20:04,092
I thought you were
going to stop work.

1294
01:20:04,176 --> 01:20:05,427
After the wedding.

1295
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:08,638
Today is father and daughter day.
You two go.

1296
01:20:10,724 --> 01:20:11,892
Bye.

1297
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,852
Can I go with you?

1298
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:16,271
Oh, darling, no.
You've got to study.

1299
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:19,065
Besides, Anne doesn't think the Lombards
are a very good influence on you.

1300
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:20,734
She suggested I go.

1301
01:20:20,817 --> 01:20:23,904
That's very generous of her, but I mustn't
take advantage of her generosity.

1302
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:25,572
Good-bye, darling.

1303
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,950
What a fake.
What an incredible fake.

1304
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:30,285
But I love him.

1305
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:33,371
Don't study too hard,
Madame Pascal Spinoza.

1306
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,419
It's gone too far.
I must tell her.

1307
01:20:39,503 --> 01:20:43,089
I must tell her right away
that this is all my doing.

1308
01:20:58,188 --> 01:21:01,733
There's no question.
I must tell her.

1309
01:21:01,816 --> 01:21:06,029
But how?
What can I tell her?

1310
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:08,573
She'll never forgive me,

1311
01:21:08,657 --> 01:21:11,868
and she'll have a weapon
against me forever.

1312
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:14,246
Oh...

1313
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,876
Where's she going?

1314
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,672
Maybe she wants to join him
at the Lombards' yacht.

1315
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:27,300
I can't let her go.
I must stop her.

1316
01:21:58,039 --> 01:22:00,667
No, maybe I won't stop her.

1317
01:22:10,552 --> 01:22:13,346
I'd like to see what she'll do.

1318
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:26,670
Now, Raymond, stop that.

1319
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:28,421
Why?

1320
01:23:28,505 --> 01:23:30,674
You're really very nervy.

1321
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:33,218
You think you can pick up
right where we left off?

1322
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:35,595
Not at all.
You were sunburned.

1323
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,848
I've got a brilliant
tan now, haven't I?

1324
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:40,475
Lovely.

1325
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:41,935
Lovelier than Anne's?

1326
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:45,855
Much. But, then, a young
girl's skin is always much lovelier.

1327
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:51,903
You didn't seem to think so
a few weeks ago.

1328
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:55,865
Will you stop punishing me
because I had to satisfy my curiosity?

1329
01:23:55,949 --> 01:23:58,868
You weren't curious.
You were greedy.

1330
01:23:58,952 --> 01:24:01,121
And why were you ready
to marry her?

1331
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:03,123
With a woman like Anne,

1332
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:05,291
you had to say a thing like that
and you know it.

1333
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:09,462
Raymond!

1334
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:41,911
Anne...

1335
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,165
Anne...

1336
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:47,917
Wait.

1337
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:50,503
It's a mistake. It's my fault.

1338
01:24:50,587 --> 01:24:52,255
Please, Cecile, let go.

1339
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:53,923
Anne, we need you.

1340
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:56,301
No, you don't need anybody.
Either of you.

1341
01:24:56,384 --> 01:24:57,594
- We do.
- No.

1342
01:24:57,677 --> 01:24:59,763
But wait.
Forgive me.

1343
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:02,056
No. You forgive me.

1344
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:26,122
Been trying to write to her.

1345
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:27,665
Where? To Paris?

1346
01:25:27,749 --> 01:25:29,125
I suppose
that's where she's gone.

1347
01:25:29,209 --> 01:25:30,960
What can I say?

1348
01:25:31,044 --> 01:25:34,589
“Dear Anne, I'm sorry
I went to the woods with Elsa.”

1349
01:25:34,672 --> 01:25:37,592
Meaning,
“I'm sorry you caught me.”

1350
01:25:37,675 --> 01:25:40,053
“Dear Anne, it meant nothing to me.

1351
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:41,554
That sort of thing never does.”

1352
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:43,348
She'll never understand that.

1353
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:47,435
“Dear Anne, a man says
silly things to a silly woman,

1354
01:25:47,519 --> 01:25:50,605
particularly
if he's a vain, silly man.”

1355
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:53,608
You know, it was bound to
have happened sooner or later.

1356
01:25:53,691 --> 01:25:55,819
If not with Elsa,
with somebody else.

1357
01:25:55,902 --> 01:25:57,821
Oh, I'm a very silly man.

1358
01:25:57,904 --> 01:25:59,155
Don't talk that way.

1359
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:00,990
At least I'm aware of it.

1360
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:02,450
We can get her back.

1361
01:26:02,534 --> 01:26:05,894
We'll both write and tell her how much we
need her and ask her to forgive both of us.

1362
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:08,039
- Why both of us?
- You, then.

1363
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:11,167
No, me too.
I wasn't very nice to her, either.

1364
01:26:11,251 --> 01:26:13,169
Come on, where's that pen?

1365
01:26:13,253 --> 01:26:16,172
If we put our silly heads together,
we can think of something to say.

1366
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:21,094
Maybe we won't
have to write at all.

1367
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:23,179
Hello?

1368
01:26:23,263 --> 01:26:24,597
Yes.

1369
01:26:29,394 --> 01:26:31,104
Where?

1370
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:45,405
May I have that, please?

1371
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,865
She was a friend of ours.

1372
01:28:55,331 --> 01:28:59,544
Later, they told us that was
the seventh accident at that spot

1373
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:02,046
since the beginning of summer.

1374
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:06,759
Seven, my lucky number.

1375
01:29:21,733 --> 01:29:25,069
Anyone else would have
left my father a note

1376
01:29:25,153 --> 01:29:28,906
that would have ruined his sleep
for the rest of his life,

1377
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:35,621
but Anne gave both of us
a magnificently considerate present.

1378
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:40,835
She allowed us to believe her death
was an accident.

1379
01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:50,011
My father never mentions
the word “suicide” to anybody,

1380
01:29:51,012 --> 01:29:53,014
not even to me.

1381
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,320
Why don't we have dinner together
tomorrow after the races?

1382
01:30:07,403 --> 01:30:08,780
- Fine.
- And spend the evening.

1383
01:30:08,905 --> 01:30:11,365
- There's a new club near the Tremoille.
- Yes, I've been.

1384
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:13,117
- Fun?
- Great fun.

1385
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:15,870
Well, good night.

1386
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:35,473
I never heard
from Philippe again.

1387
01:30:35,556 --> 01:30:39,060
I suppose
he finished law school.

1388
01:30:39,143 --> 01:30:43,272
Elsa, she's living
in South America.

1389
01:30:44,774 --> 01:30:46,859
And my father and me?

1390
01:30:48,653 --> 01:30:50,988
We still share this apartment,

1391
01:30:51,072 --> 01:30:54,700
our evenings, our friends.

1392
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:59,038
This summer, we're going south again
for his holiday,

1393
01:31:00,164 --> 01:31:03,167
only this time
to the Italian Riviera...

1394
01:31:04,377 --> 01:31:07,255
for a change,
we say to each other.

1395
01:31:08,381 --> 01:31:11,217
But we don't say
why we want a change,

1396
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:13,803
nor do we ask.

1397
01:31:13,886 --> 01:31:17,807
We have an unspoken agreement
never to mention last summer.

1398
01:31:24,647 --> 01:31:26,524
Come in.

1399
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:32,822
You're checking in early.

1400
01:31:34,073 --> 01:31:35,783
Denise is a bore.

1401
01:31:37,994 --> 01:31:39,871
So soon?

1402
01:31:40,788 --> 01:31:43,124
Well, there's no time limit on bores.

1403
01:31:46,419 --> 01:31:47,837
By the way,

1404
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,090
did you notice Yvonne Marie
at that cocktail party?

1405
01:31:51,883 --> 01:31:53,342
Yes.

1406
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:55,178
She didn't look bad at all.

1407
01:31:56,012 --> 01:31:58,264
No, I should say not.

1408
01:31:58,347 --> 01:32:00,766
Not bad at all.

1409
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:04,270
Will you be taking her south?

1410
01:32:06,147 --> 01:32:08,649
I'll let you know
at the end of the week.

1411
01:32:11,068 --> 01:32:13,029
If you do,

1412
01:32:13,112 --> 01:32:15,865
perhaps you'd rather I didn't come.

1413
01:32:17,617 --> 01:32:20,119
You have to come.
You have to.

1414
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:23,247
Then I'll come.

1415
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:26,417
Besides,

1416
01:32:27,835 --> 01:32:29,712
you need the rest.

1417
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:31,422
You're tired.

1418
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:35,384
Yes. I'm tired.

1419
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:38,221
Good night, darling.

1420
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:39,805
Good night, Raymond.

1421
01:32:41,474 --> 01:32:45,728
So here I am, surrounded
by my wall of memory.

1422
01:32:47,146 --> 01:32:50,066
I try to stop remembering,

1423
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:51,692
but I can't.

1424
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:55,321
And so often I wonder...

1425
01:32:56,405 --> 01:32:59,075
when he's alone,

1426
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:01,494
is he remembering too?

1427
01:33:03,537 --> 01:33:05,539
I hope not.
