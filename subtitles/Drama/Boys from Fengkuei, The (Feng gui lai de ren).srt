Hong Pei,

44
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,650
do you want me to help you?

45
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,630
With what?

46
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll help you get fire and burn down the house.

47
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,150
What? Burn what? You can't!

48
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,830
You came here in hopes of seeing somebody, didn't you?

49
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,820
But the result was only disappointment.

50
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,160
How did you know?

51
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,790
I suggest that you stop having hope in people other than yourself. Nothing good will ever come out of it.

52
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:18,290
This is so boring. Let's go. I have to hurry home to watch my cartoons.

53
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,840
Hey! We're almost late!

54
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,180
It's normal to have hope,

55
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,360
hope that she still remembers me,

56
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,900
just like what I believe. One day, we'll meet again.

57
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,200
Jian Hao, why are you here?

58
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,550
You ask me that every time we see each other. I don't even know how to answer anymore.

59
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,190
I'm sorry. I just didn't expect that someone--

60
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,000
That someone will come here, right?

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,330
I suddenly missed him a lot today.

62
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,070
It felt like he came here,

63
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,090
so I came here without even thinking about it.

64
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,090
Don't you find it very magical?

65
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,560
We both came here at the same time without any planning.

66
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:44,510
I was thinking, maybe Hong Pei was telepathically thinking about us.

67
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,170
I heard others say that only people whom he loves can sense it.

68
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:00,120
Sometimes, I wonder whether or not I should believe this type of superstition. I clearly know that it's not very scientific,

69
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,180
but I can't help but believe it.

70
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,720
I believe it

71
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,090
because you and Hong Pei were good friends.

72
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,960
It's very natural for you to be able to sense it.

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,410
I was thinking, in this world, only us two can get together

74
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,460
to miss him together. Why?

75
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,350
Because you are his girlfriend, and I'm his good friend.

76
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,770
Since both of us are already here, where is he?

77
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,010
Hong Pei! Ling Hong Pei!

78
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,420
Could he have left already?

79
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,080
He won't ditch us.

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,800
- Ling Hong Pei! <br>- Hong Pei!

81
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,490
Ling Hong Pei! Hey, Ling Hong Pei!

82
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,690
Hey, why are you in such a rush? Are you being chased?

83
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,800
Didn't I already tell you that I have to hurry home to watch my cartoons? Of course I have to rush.

84
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,590
Cartoons don't have legs, so it's not like they'll run away. What's the rush?

85
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,290
Of course I have to rush. In just an hour and forty-three minutes,

86
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,720
I would have already gone a whole week without seeing my Xiao Qian (Character from the cartoon). You ask me why I'm in a rush?

87
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,080
My feet are in more of a rush than I am. Look at how fast they're moving.

88
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,610
Wow, your geek-level is completely maxed out. Can't you just watch it online?

89
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,580
To be honest, I've noticed that there's almost nothing that you can't do online.

90
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,330
Of course.

91
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,730
Hey, stop doing that. What do you want now? I've already done everything I could.

92
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,890
- It's nothing. Don't you think the weather is really nice today? Doesn't it feel good? <br>- It's alright.

93
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,080
Can I ask you for another favor?

94
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,030
- No! <br>- Big Brother Shu Hai!

95
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,320
Hey, aren't you too shameless? We were born in the same year, but you were born in an earlier month.

96
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,140
You call me <i>Big Brother</i> Shu Hai?

97
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,050
It's true we were born in the same year, but I've been dead for six years. If I'm 22 years old,

98
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,970
- then you're already 28 years old!<br>- You--

99
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,260
I don't have much time left. After you return the watch...

100
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,800
You're so annoying.

101
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
I know.

102
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,550
What do you want?

103
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,850
Why did I agree to this?

104
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,140
I haven't been in a basketball court in so long. It feels great.

105
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,310
Let's go play a round!

106
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,170
Hey, watch your words. I didn't say that I would play with you.

107
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,470
What's wrong? You don't want to play? Not interested?

108
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,010
What do you think?

109
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,670
Whatever.

Why is your face so pale? Are you okay? Let's just go home.

131
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,910
Who said that? I can do it.

132
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,580
I don't believe that I can't score.

133
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,900
Hey, look!

134
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:23,620
W-Wang Shu Hai! Wang Shu Hai, I touched the ball!

135

Wang Shu Hai...

136
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,650
Wang Shu Hai!

137
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,540
It's so magical. This is a shocking new discovery! I was able to touch something.

138
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,510
I clearly couldn't touch things, but at that moment, how did I touch it?

139
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,170
That's weird.

140
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,080
It was your willpower. It shows how badly you want to hurt me.

141
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,490
It was a basketball player's reflexes. Don't take it to heart.

142
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,180
I didn't take it to heart. I took it to my face.

143
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,670
How have I ever wronged you?

144
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,230
I'm sorry. You know that it was an accident.

145
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,770
Why do I feel like you're still laughing at my sufferings?

146
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,550
Laugh. You laugh. You'll be crying in a little bit.

147
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,030
I'm not laughing. I naturally look like this.

148
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:32,980
<i>[I think I saw you on the basketball court today!]<br>[That's right. I did, too!]<br></i>You're happy, aren't you? See, not only am I an ugly geek, I'm now tan, too.

149
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,510
What "ugly geek"? Stop making up words.

150
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,330
<i>- Shh... I don't want to hear the details. <br>- His nearsightedness must have gotten worse.</i>

151
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,220
<i>- He must have met a ghost. <br>- I saw him, too.</i>

152
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,540
<i>That's right! I went to play basketball today with a ghost!</i>

153
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,580
<i>- Really? <br>- How would you play? <br>- It must have been hard to play defense. <br>- Who won?</i>

154
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,250
I'm still happy, though.

155
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,790
I originally thought that I have nothing to do with this world anymore.

156
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,950
I was already mentally prepared for it, but the moment I touched the ball... Wow.

157
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,870
<i>- Stop being so stupid. No matter how handsome he is, he's still a ghost! <br>- Oh, please. Meeting a beautiful female ghost is called real luck.</i>

158
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,820
I don't know.

159
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,010
<i>- What did he wear while playing basketball? A ghost wearing clothes doesn't sound very logical. <br>- How would a ghost change clothes after he sweats?</i>

160
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,180
<i>[My god! How's his body? Does he have chocolate abs?] </i><br>I'm suddenly not hopeless anymore.

161
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,080
I feel like I haven't left the human world yet.

162
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,340
I suddenly feel so real!

163
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,340
<i>Get him to take off his clothes!</i>

164
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,100
<i>Take off his clothes!</i>

165
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,850
<i>Take off his clothes!</i>

166
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,410
Hey, you're so dirty. You're so sweaty from playing basketball.

167
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,160
You're laying on my bed without even showering.

168
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,930
Was your room very clean to begin with?

169
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,370
I think being comfortable is being clean. Uncomfortable is unclean.

170
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,300
At least take a shower and change your clothes.

171
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,520
How would I change?

172
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,910
Use your willpower.

173
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,950
Why are you suddenly asking me to change clothes?

174
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,570
Oh! What are you looking at?

175
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:09,400
It's not that. A ghost only needs a soul. Why do you need to wear clothes?

176
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,790
If you put it like that, you're naked right now, right?

177
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,040
Naked? Would it be like that?

178
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,760
Why did you take off your clothes?

179
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,950
It was all your fault! You were talking about being naked!

180
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,690
Don't be worried. Wait a second.

181
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,290
What are you doing?

182
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,680
Burning clothes for you to wear.

183
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,310
What's wrong with you? Why are you burning a sailor suit for me?

184
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,980
Don't come over here.

185
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,560
Abudaladalah. I'm going to kill you with my Hexagram Curse.

186
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,970
I'm going to use my electromagnetic waves and the power of science to blow you up!

187
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,660
Beep-beep. You dare to chop me? I'm going to beep your beep!

188
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,960
Wang Shu Hai isn't coming today, either.

189
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,290
It feels super weird to be missing one person.

190
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,630
It's so beep-beep. Dorae-Supermon is late again.

191
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,090
It's strange. I don't think he's late.

192
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,790
Haven't you realized that we haven't see Dorae-Supermon in a long time? This isn't logical.

193
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,750
H-He completely disappeared.

194
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,530
It's so beep-beep. Dorae-Supermon has always been great.

195
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,530
We don't have to worry about him.

196
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,150
From what I can tell, your spirit is affected by hidden cues.

197
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,300
These hidden cues are like commands.

198
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,000
As long as your spirit thinks about what you should wear,

199
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,980
it will be able to wear the clothes it wants.

200
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,970
This is different from willpower, though.

201
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,670
Your willpower makes up a part of the command.

202
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,860
To put it simply, as long as you want it, you can have it.

203
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,450
It's true!

204
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,630
Wow!

205
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,070
What are you doing?

206
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,340
Turns out your legs are really floating in midair.

207
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,040
This is the same as when you hit me and your change of clothes.

208
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,960
Because you thought that you could touch these things, it appeared as you were really touching them.

209
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,820
It really only lasts for one second.

210
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,210
That's right. It's only one second.

211
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,540
So that means that I might have other abilities that I don't know of?

212
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,500
How about it? Do you want to try some more things?

213
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,140
Okay.

214
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,880
But I suddenly feel so tired. I suddenly want to sleep.

215
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,860
I thought you didn't need to sleep.

216
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,180
Hey.

217
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,240
He fell asleep.

218
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,740
Touching too many things

219
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,640
uses up a lot of energy.

220
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:42,140
<i>Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The Regretful Lovers Team @ Viki</i>

221
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,860
Hey, aren't you cold standing here?

222
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,490
Why are you still here at this time?

223
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,070
There's a meeting tomorrow, so the design department is working overtime.

224
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,630
Assistant Director, aren't you too strict? I don't think there's a need for this.

225
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,860
In the previous years, the seasonal packaging design change usually happens--

226
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,780
In order to decrease my guilt, I was going to go out to buy midnight snacks for them.

227
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,580
Let's go.

228
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,640
We're not going together?

229
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,200
Aren't you just trying to get me to go into the company?

230
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,900
No one can force you to take over a position that you don't want. Isn't that right?

231
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,860
We don't have to follow our parents' arrangements.

232
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,660
If we don't go down that road, no one can force us to.

233
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,320
What should I do?

234
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,850
I'm already on this road.

235
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,840
More importantly, no one forced me to.

236
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,520
<i>Wang Shu Hai isn't here?</i>

237

<i>It's so late. Where would he have gone?</i>

238
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,330
We should have it.

239
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,930
It's in the second cabinet's third or fourth row.

240
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,910
<i>I will have to return this watch to its owner sooner or later.</i>

241
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,510
<i>Wouldn't that mean Ling Hong Pei will completely disappear?</i>

242
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:04,220
<i>No, I have to think of a way to help him.</i>

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,500
Hello?

250
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,430
Hello, Dorae-Supermon.

251
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,410
What? What do you need?

252
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,850
I wanted to ask you how your progress on the watch is.

253
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,760
Oh. I haven't fixed the watch yet.

254
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,300
Could it be so hard that it's even unfixable for you?

255
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,440
How is that possible? The word "unfixable" isn't even in my vocabulary.

256
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,800
It's fixed, then?

257
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,590
Of course. It's been fixed for a long time.

258
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,810
That's great. Hey, will you come to work tomorrow?

259
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,120
Bring the watch with you.

260
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,580
- Hey, Zheng Nan. Wait.<br><i>- Bye bye! See you tomorrow.</i>

261
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,700
Hello? Hello?

262
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,110
- You... <br>- I... <br>- You first. <br>- You say it first.

263
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,650
You're the dead one, so go ahead.

264
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,850
Aren't you pursuing your goddess colleague?

265
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,890
You're going to work today, right?

266
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,230
I'll come with you.

267
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,750
To repay you, I can help you...

268
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,330
Stalk her.

269
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,810
You're the one who gets to stalk her, not me.

270
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,050
What do you think?

271
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,790
I will think of a way to get her to like you.

272
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,410
Stop dreaming. She's a goddess.

273
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,150
How could she like me?

274
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,930
How will we know without trying? We'll have to try it to find out. I can promise you that

275
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,070
there won't be a problem!

276
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,190
Your promise has no evidence.

277
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,490
Am I the naive one or are you?

278
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,530
Wang Shu Hai, getting her to like you is my responsibility.

279
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,670
- So... <br>- Stop. Please don't be like this.

280
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:55,330
What do you really want? Say it.

281
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,970
Say it!

282
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,830
I'll help your pursue the goddess,

283
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,910
- and you help me with yesterday's...<br>- No.

284
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,890
I already said that I will return the watch today.

285
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:14,110
So soon? Can't you postpone it?

286
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,810
No. I have to return it back to her.

287
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:28,110
Just help me one more time. Maybe I'll find a way to break away from this watch.

288
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,850
Aren't you very interested in this experiment, too?

289
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,430
That's true, but we can't.

290
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:39,470
Didn't you already see it last night? You don't need to sleep at all,

291
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,090
but after our experiments,

292
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,030
your situation worsened.

293
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,950
I don't want to take that risk.

294
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,030
But I'm fine.

295
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,470
I find it regretful, too.

296
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,630
After I slept, I'm all energized again.

297
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:01,190
This corn is so good. What brand is it?

298
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,250
I'm being serious. If you return the watch, I won't even have the chance to take the risk anymore.

299
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,270
If I disappear, I won't have another chance. Please help me one more time.

300
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,350
Are you just hoping to see your girlfriend

301
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,910
or family members again?

302
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,090
Why can't I have hope? I'm not you.

303
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,570
If it's something I can do, I would do it and try it.

304
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,610
I won't avoid something without even trying.

305
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,830
Maybe you once got hurt because you had hope, but I won't, okay?

306
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,630
Okay. As long as you don't get hurt, then it's fine.

307
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,950
Then there's no point in me feeling sorry for you.

308
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,730
What do you mean?

309
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,310
Because I won't do anything that satisfies what you are hoping for.

310
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:57,330
What was he trying to lecture me for? Who is he trying to piss off when he's dead already?

311
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,530
Dorae-Supermon, you're so great.

312
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:10,970
It's just like new! Wow.

313
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,750
Wait.

314
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,410
Could you have bought a new one for me because you couldn't fix it?

315
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,710
Good thing I, Dorae-Supermon, have a great foresight,

316
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,710
so I purposefully didn't fix the scratch on the watch.

317
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:29,190
I'm sorry. It's not that I didn't want to fix it, but as long as hate still exists in this world,

318
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,970
I will have to have hundreds of ways to justify myself in order to handle others' ridicule.

319
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,650
I'm not afraid of your hate. I'm only afraid that you have no hate. So? Scared, right?

320
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,310
Are you done talking? Was that supposed to be a riddle? Aren't you a hateful person yourself?

321
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:42,330
None of your business, but no one can hate on me.

322
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,450
Fine. How much was it? I'll pay you.

323
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,410
Are you mental? You don't have to give me money.

324
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,990
Don't worry. I won't pay you for fixing the watch. I was asking about the material fee.

325
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,730
Finding these materials must have costed you a lot of cash, right?

326
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,390
What cash? Hey,

327
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,310
with our friendship, this amount of money is nothing.

328
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,970
What an idiot. Unless you want to give me 15,000 NTD.

329
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,050
In your dreams!

330
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,510
All in all, you brought this watch back to life.

331
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,670
My friend will be super happy! Good job!

332
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,510
It's nothing.

333
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,130
Okay, I'm leaving now.

334
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,230
Zheng Nan.

335
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,710
What do you want?

336
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,890
Who's that friend of yours?

337
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,990
The person who wanted me to fix the watch was a girl?

338
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,030
Do I know her?

339
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:43,890
She's my best friend from college.

340
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:50,970
Wait a second. When have you ever been so interested in my friends before?

341
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,990
How could possibly want me to introduce her to you?

342
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,630
I was just thinking, it's not like the watch is a person.

343
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,450
How could she be so happy after it being fixed? Can't I be curious?

344
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,050
You can't. I already told you that she's my best friend college.

345
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,550
If she's happy, then I'm happy

346
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:17,110
Then... Is she living well?

347
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:24,090
Don't tell me that she already has a boyfriend or she's even married?

348
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,010
Don't worry. Even if you, Wang Shu Hai, were to reincarnate 5380 times, the answer to this question

349
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,330
is still none of your business.

350
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,890
So that means she does? For how many months?

351
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:47,090
You're so weird. When did you turn from a geek into a pervert?

352
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,870
I'm not.

353
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,570
I'm going to stop bickering with you.

354
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,590
I have to go to a meeting.

355
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,830
Hurry, then. If there are any problems with the watch,

356
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,690
you can bring it back to me.

357
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,310
Don't worry. Your Dorae products have amazing qualities.

358
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,770
High five!

359
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,350
Wait for me!

360
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,570
Wait for me!

361
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,870
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

362
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,930
You seem to be bleeding.

363
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,090
Aren't you Zheng Nan's friend?

364
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,150
♫<i> I don’t know when you started telling me all sorts of things. </i>♫

365
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,030
It's okay. Don't worry about it. I can do it myself.

366
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:48,830
♫<i> But after chatting for a while, I realized that I was head over heels in love with you. </i>♫

367
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:57,490
♫<i> I’ll keep you company along with the night sky. You talking about your honey completely breaks my heart. </i>♫

368
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,950
Si Yi, the meeting is about to start. What are you doing?

369
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,290
Why are you here?

370
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,150
Don't always ask me that. I'll definitely appear.

371
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,230
You have to remember to put on medicine.

372
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,670
♫<i> But you don’t see the truth. </i>♫

373
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:26,050
♫<i> Oh, baby. If you’re crying in pain, I’ll stay with you the whole night. </i>♫

374
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,510
Look at Shu Hai. He's acting so weird.

375
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,830
♫<i> I’m still willing to wait, wait until you slowly realize it one day. </i>♫

376
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,170
Everyone.

377
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,830
2D interactions

378
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,130
can no longer satisfy me!

379
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,850
Could you have reached 3D interactions?

380
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,670
<i>Interactions:</i>

381
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,390
<i> A term used in anime.</i>

382
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,710
<i>2D Interactions:</i>

383
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,050
<i>Interactions from a virtual world of video games.</i>

384
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,550
<i>3D Interactions:</i>

385
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,230
<i>Interactions in the real world.</i>

386
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,910
Shu Hai, you have to explain everything clearly to us. You can't miss a second.

387
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,630
♫<i> You know I love you. </i>♫

388
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,570
I'm too embarrassed to.

389
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,650
Hey!

390
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,730
It's really fixed?

391
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,630
- Wow.<br>- Didn't I tell you that he's very amazing?

392
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,810
Then how much is the repair fee? Does he have a repair store?

393
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,350
He only repairs as a hobby.

394
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,850
No, I have to pay or else I'll feel bad.

395
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,210
Just ask him for a price.

396
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,530
He won't want your money.

397
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,470
Really? But... Hey!

398
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,770
What about this, I'll treat him dinner?

399
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,890
Let me tell you. Whenever he's face-to-face with a girl,

400
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,590
he can't make eye contact for longer than three seconds.

401
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:45,430
<i>You are Zheng Nan's neighbor and friend, right?</i>

402
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,690
<i>Wait for me.</i>

403
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,170
<i>I'm sorry! I think you're bleeding.</i>

404
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,730
He seems like he's shy.

405
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,450
He is not shy.

406
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,610
He has an illness. I suggest that you don't personally experience it, okay?

407
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,250
Zheng Nan, I really want to treat him for dinner.

408
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,090
I want to personally thank him.

409
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,450
If you treat him for dinner, I think he will be super excited!

410
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,750
Okay, leave it to me.

411
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,990
Thanks.

412
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:28,770
Oh, yeah. Don't tell him that the owner of the watch is treating him to dinner.

413
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,990
Why not?

414
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,470
I'm scared that he won't come.

415
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,490
He won't be like that--

416
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,770
He will. Just listen to me.

417
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,290
Let's go.

418
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,970
- It scared me today. <br> - What's wrong?

419
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,470
Xiang Jian Hao! Why did he suddenly appear in the meeting?

420
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:52,050
Wasn't his chuunibyou acting up before, saying that he won't take over the company, no matter what?

421
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,130
Just start eating. Your dad and Director Xu are in the guesthouse.

422
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,190
They have things to discuss. Let's just eat.

423
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,530
Thank you.

424
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:22,470
I heard that at the board meeting today, you officially accepted the CEO position?

425
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,080
I did not accept the position to inherit the company.

426
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,380
That's okay. You can enter the company and learn the work first

427
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:42,590
Oh, yeah. Why aren't you entering the company to work?

428
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,830
Oh. I haven't graduated from college yet.

429
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:51,410
That doesn't matter. Your dad opened the company. Or are you scared of others' gossip?

430
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,850
He's not like you. He doesn't have the capabilities.

431
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,470
Let's eat.

432
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,430
Oh, right. You and Li Mei--

433
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,870
I don't want to talk about this.

434
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,610
This problem has already been delayed for a long time, and also--

435
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,590
I'll say it again.

436
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,990
You don't have the right to interfere with my marriage.

437
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,650
Older Brother, don't talk to Mom that way.

438
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,210
I'm sorry,

439
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:48,790
but she is your mom, not mine. Also, I am not your brother.

440
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,410
- Older Brother... <br>- I don't have family members like you two.

441
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,470
Let's eat.

442
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,040
Is your brother's chuunibyou acting up again?

443
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,100
<i>Chuunibyou: A Japanese internet slang, making fun of teenagers who are arrogantly conceited, thinks that they're misunderstood, and thinks that their lives are horrible. It's an immature act of escaping reality or self-assurance.</i>

444
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:21,320
<i>Chuunibyou: A Japanese internet slang, making fun of teenagers who are arrogantly conceited, thinks that they're misunderstood, and thinks that their lives are horrible. It's an immature act of escaping reality or self-assurance.</i>

445
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,240
There's not one day that he doesn't act up.

446
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,060
What will you do?

447
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,740
This was all because of me.

448
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,220
I have to find a way to help him.

449
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,950
Why should you help him? It wasn't your fault.

450
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,340
It was my mom's fault.

451
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,610
I was a mistress's child.

452
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,960
My whole existence is a mistake.

453
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,160
Xiang Jian Ren, why are you so pessimistic?

454
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,340
I'm not being pessimistic.

455
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,250
I'm just stating the truth.

456
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,690
Because I understand this truth,

457
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,870
no matter how angry my brother gets at me,

458
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,710
I have to find a way to forgive him.

459
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,370
Hey, I'm sorry.

460
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:18,910
You're the only one I can complain to about my chaotic family.

461
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,260
It's not like we're strangers. I'll listen to whatever you have to say.

462
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,000
Thank you.

463
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,920
<i>Traditional Massage</i>

464
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,060
No matter who it's with, I must receive 3D interaction!

465
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,010
Hey, is this really the right place?

466
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,480
Of course. Don't you feel like the magnetic field here

467
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,070
is very different? It's unscientific.

468
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,880
This doesn't feel like a place we can get 3D interactions from, though.

469
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,060
Are you sure you've been here before? It has "pure" written on there!

470
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,500
I've never been here, but don't you think that this "pure"

471
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,730
looks very much like a disguise?

472
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,340
Also, look at how mysterious the design here is.

473
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,490
Most importantly, this place is in such a small village.

474
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,950
Why would ordinary people come in here? It's unscientific.

475
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:21,690
Only people who are familiar with this place would come. Isn't that right?

476
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,180
Judging by what you said, it seems to be true.

477
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,030
I think your analysis is very logical!

478
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,160
What do we do now? Should we go in?

479
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,610
Oh! I don't dare to! You guys go first!

480
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:37,740
Hey, since you recommended this place, you go first.

481
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,130
From a scientific point of view, if I wasn't afraid to go in, I would have gone in a long time ago.

482
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,820
Hey! Why did it turn into me?

483
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,260
You guys are such scardy cats. How would you get 3D interactions this way?

484
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,160
How about I count to three, and we go in at the same time?

485
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,700
I'm going to start now: One...

486
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,570
Hey! Wait for me! Who's calling me? Oh, Zheng Nan.

487
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,570
Hello? What do you need?

488
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,700
Wang Shu Hai, you're so dirty.

489
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,590
Uh... I'm done.

490
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,510
Come out and let me see.

491
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,460
Let's just forget it. I'll find someone else.

492
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,100
- Don't be like this, Zheng Nan! <br>- That scared me.

493
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,010
I'm begging you, don't leave.

494
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,860
I still have a lot of clothes left. I won't disappoint you.

495
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:59,690
Fine, get up. Get up! It itches.

496
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,140
Are you free on Saturday?

497
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:12,660
Saturday? Yes, I'm free.

498
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,160
What was with that twirl?

499
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,340
I'm embarrassed.

500
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,450
Are you mental? Why would you be embarrassed?

501
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:31,970
Because this is the first time you've ever introduced a girl to me.

502
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,440
My little brother Shu Hai has been behaving very well these days.

503
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,210
Is this how you repay me for fixing the watch?

504
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,100
You could say that.

505
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,540
Then, what other things do you have for me to fix?

506
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,940
I don't have that many broken things.

507
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,380
All in all, it's on Saturday. Don't forget.

508
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,600
Time to go to sleep.

509
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,360
I'm going to remind you again: The other person is an unsurpassable beauty.

510
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,030
She has a good figure and good skin. You need to remember three things.

511
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,740
- Number one, don't be too messy. <br>- Okay.

512
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,300
Number two, don't be late.

513
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,780
- Okay. <br>- Number three, you're not allowed to embarass me.

514
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,690
Okay. I'll try my best to be embarrassing.

515
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,030
What are you talking about?

516
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,330
I mean, I'll try my best not to embarrass you.

517
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,870
Good boy. Get to sleep early.

518
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,570
Bye bye.

519
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:46,660
<i>Everyone, how do you turn a geek into someone handsome?</i>

520
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,590
I'm done for.

521
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:10,290
How do I turn handsome?

522
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,150
<i>As long as you want it, you can have it.</i>

523
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:23,740
<i>I'll help you get your goddess. I'll think of a way to get her to like you.</i>

524
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,790
Ling Hong Pei!

525
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,960
Get up. Hurry and get up.

526
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,540
What?

527
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,160
Didn't you say that you'll help me get the girl?

528
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,980
You have no integrity. I don't want to help you get your goddess.

529
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:06,150
It's not the goddess. I'm trying to get the fairy this time. They're different.

530
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,800
Can we renegotiate the conditions?

531
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,960
Oh, whatever. I'll agree to whatever requests you have.

532
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,880
You have no moral principles. I don't want to help you.

533
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:25,260
A handsome guy like you doesn't understand what it's like to be a geek.

534
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:38,550
To be honest, you're hopeless.

535
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:46,870
- How about you possess me?<br>- Huh?

536
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,270
Can't ghosts possess people? You can possess me

537
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,410
and then meet with the fairy in place of me. What do you think?

538
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,120
Wow, Wang Shu Hai. I really don't know what to say to you anymore.

539
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,140
In order to get a girl, do you really have to come to this extent of asking to be possessed by a ghost?

540
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:05,940
I heard from the others that the first impression is the most important.

541
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,560
What can I do? I don't know how to possess people. How do I possess?

542
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,350
This is the only time you're willing to test things out with me?

543
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,910
Just get on. Stop saying so much useless things.

544
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,950
Is it like this?

545
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,450
Hey, you're a ghost. You should know more than I do.

546
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,480
How would I know? It's my first time, okay?

547
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,430
It's my first time, too.

548
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,110
Okay, so be gentle with your actions. Don't get too rough.

549
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,010
I'm coming.

550
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,180
How about this, I'll turn around. It might be easier for you that way.

551
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:21,910
Is it more comfortable for you like this?

552
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,890
It doesn't matter whether or not I'm comfortable.

553
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,860
As long as you can come into my body, it'll be okay.

554
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,380
- Are you sure? <br>- Yes.

555
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,240
Just do it.

556
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,070
Okay.

557
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,290
Then I'm really going to do it, okay?

558
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,160
- Are you in? <br>- Am I? I don't know. Do you feel anything?

559
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:05,220
I feel like I'm having trouble breathing,

560
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,700
my mouth is dry,

561
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,760
and my four limbs are stuff.

562
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,420
That's because you're nervous. You're too tight.

563
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,030
Really?

564
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,090
Front and back both don't work.

565
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,690
How about you be on bottom this time?

566
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,440
I just knew that you would be here.

567
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,750
Hey, you should stop trying to get ghost-possessed.

568
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:54,700
Okay. It was my mistake just now.

569
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,030
Why don't you just get a makeover?

570
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,210
We still have sometime left until the weekend, anyway.

571
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,050
Let's come up with a solution together.

572
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,100
I'll leave it to you then, Pei Pei.

573
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,270
Hey, what's wrong?

574
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:16,870
It's nothing. I was just dizzy for a moment and I was very tired.

575
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,070
I think you should just get some good rest tonight.

576
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,520
I don't sleep this early, though.

577
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:33,140
A makeover starts with readjusting your sleeping schedule.

578
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,910
Hey, the owner of that watch was your girlfriend, right?

579
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,760
Do you still want to see her a lot right now?

580
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,750
I already asked my friend. She said that the owner of that watch

581
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,160
is living very well right now.

582
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:13,360
Even though I'm not sure, I don't think she's lacking handsome guys like you around her.

583
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:26,360
When I first started fixing the watch, I guessed that

584
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,920
if the watch is already so destroyed,

585
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,200
the owner of the watch must be no longer of this world,

586
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,460
but I would have never thought that when you died,

587
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,520
you were wearing the watch.

588
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,550
Actually, I really want to tell you

589
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,690
to not worry and just let her go.

590
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:05,990
But since your girlfriend still kept the watch on her

591
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,440
and even wanted to fix it,

592
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,250
it means that she still hasn't forgotten about you.

593
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,800
At least meet with your girlfriend one more time.

594
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,270
I'll help you with that.

It's so cold.

621
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,870
Didn't you want to transform yourself for the fairy?

622
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:47,780
I was meaning to ask you this before, but why do you set your alarm at such a weird time? It's not 10, nor 11.

623
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,890
10:11.

624
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:56,850
That's the goddess's time.

625
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:14,410
My goddess coworker will always eat bread alone on the stairs at 10:11.

627

How did you know?

628
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,370
In the beginning, I didn't really pay attention to it,

629
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:32,400
since I was able to be in the same area as my goddess,

630
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,670
but later, I realized that she always came at the same time.

631
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:44,750
Every time she came, she would be alone, sitting and eating,

632
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,340
but she never eats that much.

633
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,760
How did you know that she doesn't eat a lot?

634
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,540
Wang Shu Hai!

635
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,350
You still won't admit that you're a pervert?

636
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:05,970
Hey, have I ever denied it?

637
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,790
I really don't know what to say to you anymore.

638
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:23,440
The first time we met was at the stairs,

639
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,510
but I don't think she remembers.

640
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,820
All in all, I'm the only one who knows about this:

641
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,890
the goddess's secret.

642
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:44,790
If you put it that way, you're so strange. You clearly like the goddess so much, but why would you meet the fairy?

643
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:49,150
Because the goddess will never like me.

644
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,370
You're doing it again.

645
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,380
That's how I am.

646
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,670
Like what?

647
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,180
Like what I'm like right now.

648
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:05,450
After my alarm rings, I'll know that she'll be at the stairs. In the next fifteen minutes,

649
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:11,250
she'll be on the stairs, nicely and quietly,

650
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:20,990
without any disruptions, eating cakes, breads, and cookies.

651
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:28,220
I'm the only one who knows about this, even if I'm not with her.

652
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:42,160
Oh, yeah. I should say that this has nothing to do with whether or not I'm with her.

653
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:51,450
That's how perverted I am.

654
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,380
This is how a pervert loves someone.

655
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:14,230
Uh- Then... Pervert In Love, hurry and get ready to leave.

656
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:18,580
Okay.

657
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:24,610
Hi, Xiao Bai.

658
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,890
Xiao Bai? Who's that?

659
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,990
Are you blind?

660
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,090
I've rode him and met him before. I didn't know that he has a name.

661
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,460
Whatever. Today, I'll formally introduce you two to each other.

662
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,890
Xiao Bai, his name is Ling Hong Pei.

663
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,100
Ling Hong Pei, this is Xiao Bai.

664
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,770
Xiao Bai, ghost. Ghost, Xiao Bai. Xiao Bai, ghost--

665
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:48,490
- Hey!<br>- Huh?

666
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:56,630
Well... Xiao Bai, he's my... ghost friend.

667
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:03,570
I'm telling you, after I modified Xiao Bai,

668
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:08,490
going 60 kilometers only takes five seconds.

669
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,450
Oh? How fast is that?

670
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,080
Very fast.

671
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,290
Very fast?

672
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:39,910
Hey, didn't you say that you only need five seconds to go 60 kilometers? How could I can walk faster than you?

673
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:44,810
That's because I haven't turned on turbo mode. If I ride too fast, I'll get afraid.

674
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:51,600
What's so hard about buying clothes?

675
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:56,340
It's not hard. How about you try to match a pair of clothes?

676
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,670
Okay.

677
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,720
It looks like Halloween.

680
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,530
Buying clothes is way too hard.

681
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:02,650
Actually, half of the difficulty is because you're not used to the society.

682
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,100
What's the other half, then?

683
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:14,480

You've decided already?

687
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:35,970
I'm going to invent a tool that you can find suitable clothes with without shopping.

688
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:38,790
What do you mean?

689
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:43,780
I have a 3D scanner. I'm going to scan my image into the computer

690
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,410
and then I'll pair it with the clothing online and put them on my body.

691
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:52,430
That way, I can tell whether or not these clothes are suitable for me.

692
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:57,260

694
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:07,280

I don't know, either. Really, I don't know.

- Isn't it so magical?<br>- Is that you ability, too?

733
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,270
- I think so. <br>- This... Other than stalking in broad daylight,

734
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:28,020
this is an ability that living humans all wish to have. If you put it that way, being a ghost isn't so bad.

Hello. Welcome. Please come this way.

742
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,960

757
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,730
Don't be nervous.

758
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,770
It'll be okay. Let's take a deep breath together.

759
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:16,990
Fairy, I'm coming!

760
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:24,080
Why isn't Wang Shu Hai here yet? I told him not to be late. I called him but he wouldn't answer.

761
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,820
Would he not come?

762
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:31,970
That's impossible. Do you know how happy he was when I first told him? He was--

763
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:38,260
I won't destroy his image yet. He'll come. Trust me.

764
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,460
He's here.

765
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,330
Wang Shu Hai!

766
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,630
I told you not to be late, but you're late again!

767
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:53,850
I'm sorry! I was outside--

768
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:09,170
- You're late again. What's up with you?<br>- I'm sorry. Just now, I was outside--

769
