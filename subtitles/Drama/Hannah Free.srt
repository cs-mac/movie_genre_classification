1
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,916
You gonna get up today, Hannah?

2
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,658
What's this?

3
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,993
That's orange juice, Hannah.

4
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,159
Don't ya know
I'm allergic to orange juice?

5
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,828
Is that on your chart?

6
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:53,168
How the hell should I know?
It should be.

7
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,333
You're sure you're allergic
to orange juice?

8
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:59,272
Well, better safe than sorry
I always say.

9
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,509
Let's getcha
a little milk instead.

10
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,106
We go through this
every other week,

11
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,708
it's always news to her.

12
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,751
Wouldn't you like
to get dressed today

13
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,688
and eat with the others?

14
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,850
I wanna see Rachel.

15
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,190
Hannah, Rachel's very sick.

16
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,196
I know she's sick, goddammit.

17
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,357
Only her family can see her.

18
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:20,365
I'm family!

19
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,857
Don't get yourself all ruffled.
I'll have to give you something.

20
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,928
You know your blood pressure.

21
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,869
You tell Marge
I wanna see her mother.

22
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,400
All right, I'll tell her.

23
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,345
But I told her
day before yesterday

24
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,870
and she said no;

25
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,678
it would just upset you both.

26
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:40,885
Rachel's gonna die alone!

27
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,219
Her daughter comes
to see her every day.

28
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,282
But Rachel needs to see me.

29
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:50,224
She must be an old friend,
isn't she?

30
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,493
Friend doesn't even say it.

31
00:03:56,602 --> 00:04:00,834
Please...
You could dress and powder me...

32
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,171
I'll go sit with those
basket cases down the hall

33
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,234
if you'll just let me see her.

34
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,441
You let the
nurse's aide dress you.

35
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,678
You have a good lunch,
then we'll see.

36
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,930
It'd mean a lot
to both of us.

37
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,597
Well, that's what we want.
That's what we're here for.

38
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:53,686
<i>Can you imagine?
Doing that for a living?</i>

39
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,354
<i>She'll end up in here herself
when she's 80.</i>

40
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,856
<i>At least this room's got
a view and a window that opens.</i>

41
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,830
<i>The freight train goes by
at two every morning...</i>

42
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:09,568
<i>I listen for it.</i>

43
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,912
<i>I'd kill myself if all
I could see was parking lot.</i>

44
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,908
<i>I wonder if you can
hear the train?</i>

45
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:34,165
You guys are getting
real good at this.

46
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,102
Good morning, Hannah!

47
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,666
Oh, you have got
some mail this morning!

48
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,577
Oh, I know I saw something
in here somewhere...

49
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,344
Oh, there it is!
It's a postcard from Alaska.

50
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,148
Oh, look at the size
of that fish.

51
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:58,179
It's a... it's a...

52
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,020
Halibut.

53
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:03,017
Oh, it's a halibut.
Look! 356 pounds!

54
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,428
How would you even
catch something like that, huh?

55
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:06,897
How would you like
to go swimmin'

56
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,991
and see something like that
in the water with you, huh?

57
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,433
No thanks.

58
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,801
So would you like me
to read it to you, hon?

59
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:15,363
I'll just read it to you
like I usually do, okay.

60
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:21,678
It says, "Hey, Hannah.
The mud got another one.

61
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,150
Love and regards,
Nettie Bobo."

62
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,708
What on earth does that mean?

63
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,947
Do you have any idea
what that means, huh?

64
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,156
Well, I'm sorry, honey
I have just got to go.

65
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,421
But I'll see you tomorrow.
That's some fish.

66
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,021
My hubby would sell his soul
to hook into a fish like that.

67
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:41,362
Alaska. How do you know
someone in Alaska?

68
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,469
<i>It's people like that
drive me nuts.</i>

69
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,468
<i>Trap us like rats
and then talk us to death.</i>

70
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:58,244
<i>I can't just walk away
like I used to.</i>

71
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:02,311
<i>I didn't like somethin',
off I'd go.</i>

72
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,584
<i>That's how I ended up
in Alaska.</i>

73
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:08,457
<i>No roads. Everybody flew.</i>

74
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,624
<i>I flew over that tundra
like it was my backyard.</i>

75
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:18,130
<i>Nettie's still there...
82, canoes to work.</i>

76
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,798
<i>Digs tourists
out of the mud flats.</i>

77
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,038
<i>They sink down in that ooze
and stick like cement.</i>

78
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:30,908
<i>I loved it there...</i>

79
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,578
<i>but I had to come back.</i>

80
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,749
<i>I always had to come back...
For Rachel.</i>

81
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,725
<i>She'd never leave Michigan.
Had the kids.</i>

82
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,217
<i>Peaches to can
and pies to bake.</i>

83
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,735
<i>She looked like someone
dipped her in flour.</i>

84
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,475
<i>She looked like Mt. McKinley.</i>

85
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:00,577
I like that -
being compared to a mountain.

86
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,581
It was a compliment.

87
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,177
You were gone
so long that time

88
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,980
I thought you were
never coming back.

89
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,145
You got married.

90
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,950
To escape my father's temper,
not you.

91
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,151
I had to get out.

92
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,989
And girls are
supposed to marry.

93
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,495
Well, at least I married
the dullest man I could find.

94
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,090
Yeah, well, he was
a good provider,

95
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,191
but you'd have been trapped
for the rest of your life.

96
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,361
If Mr. Johnson hadn't
had the misfortune

97
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,371
of dying on that excursion boat.

98
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:32,503
Everyone ran to the side to wave
goodbye and the boat capsized.

99
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,843
Never marry a weak swimmer.

100
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:40,751
You waited months to write,
till after the twins were born.

101
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,886
You tried to mourn him,

102
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,586
but it was always me
you wanted to cook for.

103
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,684
Don't be smug.

104
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,427
You always thought we were

105
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,328
the only girls
who did what we did.

106
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,694
Whenever and wherever we could.

107
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,276
Of course after it was over,

108
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,256
you'd ask me to leave
and you'd go back to your Bible.

109
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,059
Never seemed to be on my side.

110
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,260
Neither was your family.

111
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,093
They still aren't.

112
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,961
Your daughter
sits with you for hours

113
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,969
but she won't let me see you.

114
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:35,303
Has the nerve to tell me
it's for my own good.

115
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:43,404
I'd like to look at you
just once and die.

116
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,345
Be a nice way to go.

117
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,255
Isn't this a switch.

118
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,093
For once you're staying in one
place and I'm the one leaving.

119
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,928
I had to go.
I had to see things.

120
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:04,766
Oh, Alaska,
New Mexico, Paris.

121
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,668
My Lord, even Ohio.

122
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,229
Now why Ohio?

123
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:09,604
It's Michigan, only flat.

124
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,270
Some of Ohio is very pretty.
You've just never seen it.

125
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,181
Every once in a while
you just had to leave me.

126
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,550
You knew I'd be wild for you
when you finally got back.

127
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,459
I've been everywhere...

128
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,424
Even South America.

129
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:35,125
That's where I found
the seeds for your moonflowers.

130
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,430
Mr. Johnson...

131
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:39,403
used to walk around with
his eyes down on the ground,

132
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,065
like he was
looking for lost change.

133
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,670
He wouldn't know
a moonflower from a lilac bush.

134
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,547
What do wives find to
talk about with their husbands?

135
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,921
Mr. Johnson and I
ran out of conversation

136
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:00,117
in less than two years.

137
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,823
You and I never did.

138
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,325
Nope.

139
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,163
Sometimes we'd sit
in the yard

140
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,795
and watch your
moonflowers come out;

141
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,863
they'd unfold in seconds,

142
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,239
just bloomin' in the night.

143
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:23,273
Then later in the night
I'd call you my moonflower...

144
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,284
when I was pressed up
under your nightgown.

145
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,319
And by morning
the moonflowers had shriveled

146
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,055
and you had
your hairnet back on.

147
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,688
How was I supposed
to cook breakfast

148
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,062
without my hairnet?

149
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,864
You have the most
beautiful hair.

150
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,427
Oh, Hannah.

151
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,269
Don't start something
we can't finish.

152
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,371
Hello, Hannah!

153
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,480
Jesus, Marge, I can hear!

154
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,848
I just can't walk
or see worth a shit.

155
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,350
The nurse says you've been
wanting to see Mom.

156
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:04,878
Of course I have.

157
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:07,221
We can't have you
upsetting her.

158
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,351
Upset?! Wh...

159
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:10,554
When did I ever
upset your mother?

160
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,564
All her life.

161
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,967
Well, if that's the case,
it was her choice.

162
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:23,538
Marge, please let me see her.

163
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:24,974
We need to see each other.

164
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,478
This is no way for us
to end our lives -

165
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,242
in two separate rooms.

166
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,078
She has her family.

167
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,242
I'm her family!

168
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,912
Please. Don't.

169
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:36,580
I used to tuck you in!

170
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,887
I told you stories.

171
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,655
I sat with you
when there were storms.

172
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:46,530
You never knew your father,
but you knew me.

173
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,597
You knew I'd always
look after you.

174
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,296
When you weren't busy...

175
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:54,430
Going to Alaska or New Mexico.

176
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,340
I sent you postcards.
I sent you presents.

177
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,775
I sent your mother money.

178
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,608
Don't act like
you were there for Mom.

179
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,477
You weren't. We were!

180
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:04,311
Roy and I were there!

181
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,786
Dammit, you were children.
You had to be there!

182
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:13,754
Hannah, I grew up
a long time ago.

183
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,922
I lost my Barbara, my daughter,
in a car accident.

184
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,396
I have grown grandchildren.

185
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,992
I cook, I clean, I can peaches.
I recycle my newspapers.

186
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,935
And once a year we drive
to the Mackinac Bridge

187
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,938
and I have a little piece
of fudge by the water.

188
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,530
And then we drive home.

189
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:30,472
And I mow the lawn.

190
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,540
But when Mom needs me,
I come.

191
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,940
You always came
when you darn well pleased.

192
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,179
You don't know
anything about it.

193
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,987
I will tell Mom
you asked after her.

194
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,224
She was a cute little girl,

195
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,633
but she's been
a pain in the ass

196
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,864
ever since she joined
the Baptist Church.

197
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,101
Hi.

198
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,668
Are you Grandma Hannah?

199
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,177
What?!

200
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,371
The nurse told me

201
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:08,845
I should speak with
'Grandma Hannah'

202
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,678
about my project for school.

203
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,978
Grandma Hannah?

204
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,178
Jesus Christ,
don't call me that.

205
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:19,521
Sorry, she must have... uh...

206
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,025
What?

207
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,894
Women's Suffrage?
The Civil War?

208
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,727
What is it you want
my sage advice about?

209
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:27,697
I'm busy.

210
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,291
The Depression.

211
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,700
I went to Alaska.

212
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,638
Caught everything I ate
except chocolate.

213
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,833
Are you writing it down?

214
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:38,901
I voted for Roosevelt
because I liked Eleanor.

215
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,037
The war broke out,
I lied about my age,

216
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,876
I joined the WACS,
and I flew planes.

217
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,244
I invested in computer stocks
in the 50s.

218
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,651
That's how come
a Depression rat like me

219
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,520
can afford this beauteous
single room in Hotel Hell.

220
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:54,719
That's it. Posterity.

221
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,387
You get asked this a lot.

222
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,295
They send all you in here.
Perk me up.

223
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,821
What in the hell
do you think I am -

224
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,026
the public library?

225
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,999
Go ask your parents

226
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,060
what it was like
getting raised in the 60s.

227
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,730
My parents are dead.

228
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,501
Well, so are mine.

229
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:15,045
Please, take me home!

230
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,447
Please, take me home!

231
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:24,278
Mama! Mama! Mama!

232
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,622
What an awful place.

233
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,524
Always have a gun handy
to shoot yourself

234
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,620
in case you fall off
a goddamned roof.

235
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,592
In Alaska if I'd fell off a roof

236
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,726
a bear woulda ate me
and made some use out of me.

237
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,936
Sit down.

238
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,941
You've been to Alaska?

239
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,442
I lived in Alaska.

240
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,167
Look at this...

241
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,442
From a friend of mine
who's still livin' up there.

242
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,278
Lord, now you're
robbing the cradle.

243
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,284
And I thought I'd seen it all.

244
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:54,285
Nonsense.

245
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,617
Living in Alaska's nonsense?

246
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:01,957
Nah, I'm just mumbling to myself.
Old people do that.

247
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:06,795
No, Alaska was great.
I was real happy living there.

248
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,959
How'd you survive?

249
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,493
Had a high school diploma.
Taught school in Barrow.

250
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:15,131
Skinned things.
You get by.

251
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:19,803
You just went and did it?
Most people dream and stay home.

252
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:23,144
There is nothing wrong
with staying home.

253
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:24,671
I'd really like
to go to Africa,

254
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,980
but I'm afraid
if I need a blood transfusion...

255
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,316
Why? You sick?

256
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:29,320
No.

257
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,480
So don't get sick.

258
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,082
The blood supply in Africa
is so tainted with AIDS.

259
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,490
What if something did happen?

260
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,551
God forbid
something should happen.

261
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:40,122
Trust me, kid,
you can 'what if' yourself

262
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,156
into a real boring life.

263
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,327
I really don't care
to listen to this.

264
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:47,304
You call this something?
I went to your wedding!

265
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,806
What?

266
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,634
She's being ridiculous.

267
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,769
Uh... nothin'. Forget it.

268
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,837
So you married?

269
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,644
Nope.

270
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:01,910
It's hard to tell.
I wonder...

271
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:04,183
Girls used to wear
pinky rings and men's socks.

272
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,183
How old are you?

273
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,714
Twenty-one.

274
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,589
Maybe she doesn't know,
but I sure knew by then.

275
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,525
Have you ever been married?

276
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,125
Not to a man.

277
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,026
Oh, yeah?

278
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,039
You gonna put that
in your paper?

279
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,301
Maybe.

280
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,303
Is she dead?

281
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,373
Almost.

282
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,351
They got her in some
other wing in this dump.

283
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:37,486
They won't let me see her.

284
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:40,923
She's in a coma,
they still won't let me see her.

285
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,023
Trying to protect us
from each other.

286
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,400
People were always doing that.

287
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:52,562
Is she who you talk to?

288
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,905
I can't go to her,
so I bring her to me.

289
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,070
And she comes on her own.

290
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,139
I still talk to my parents...
especially when I can't sleep.

291
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,586
You're the only person
I've told.

292
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,451
Well, I'm pretty damn safe.

293
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,717
I won't tell.

294
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,589
They died last year.
Car accident.

295
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,859
Rachel's been
in a coma a while...

296
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,593
Stroke.

297
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,731
I was in the hospital
all busted up

298
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,101
or I woulda taken care of her.

299
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,233
And now her damn daughter...

300
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,444
That's her legal family,
you know,

301
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,106
so, anyway, here I sit.

302
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,616
And Rachel's right here
in this nursing home?

303
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,144
Beats the hell out of me

304
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,153
what they think
I'm gonna do to her.

305
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,052
I just...

306
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,148
I wanted to say goodbye.

307
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,785
Her daughter's
with her all the time?

308
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,590
Well, she goes home at night.

309
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:59,037
God, I'm just so afraid
that she's gonna die alone.

310
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,595
Late at night.

311
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,041
That'd be her way,
slip out real quiet-like.

312
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,647
But if it was up to her,
she'd want me there.

313
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,309
Don't be too sure.

314
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:16,646
You're so funny.
She's being funny.

315
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,781
A nurse told me
that people can visit

316
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,757
24 hours a day
if they want.

317
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,827
Nobody wants to.

318
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:26,160
But they can.
I mean, I could.

319
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,758
Could come by
at three in the morning,

320
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,633
swing by your room,
visiting you.

321
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,662
Take you for a stroll
to Rachel's room...

322
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,333
You mean that?

323
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,373
Um...

324
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,379
You'd have to help me
into my chair.

325
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,005
Is your back strong?

326
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,176
Don't worry about it.
I play softball and basketball.

327
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,015
Uh huh.

328
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,850
So it's no problem.

329
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,219
Good.

330
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,247
Because she could
go in a year,

331
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,156
or she could go tonight.

332
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,718
And I don't wanna miss her.

333
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,954
Then let's go tonight.

334
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,363
Three o'clock sound good?

335
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,457
Yeah.

336
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,866
How come you're goin'
outta your way for me, kid?

337
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,564
I don't know.

338
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,369
Maybe so somebody'll
help me out when I'm old.

339
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,466
Yeah, don't count on it.

340
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,405
You seen my horses?

341
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,310
Nope.
Got nothin' in here but goats.

342
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,875
You might want to check
the TV room down the hall.

343
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,217
I'll just do that.

344
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,189
How the hell
they got outta the barn,

345
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:27,316
that's what I wanna know.

346
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,883
This way?

347
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,895
Turn left
at the drinking fountain.

348
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,892
See ya around, toots.

349
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,237
He a regular?

350
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,102
Never seen him before.

351
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,836
At least he's got
all his parts.

352
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,572
It's those diabetics
with stumps for legs

353
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,944
that depress
the hell out of me.

354
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,245
Especially when
I knew 'em before, you know.

355
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,252
Some of these kids
are from school.

356
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,687
Is there anything you need?

357
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:59,349
Anything I can
bring you tonight?

358
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,594
Just Rachel.

359
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,923
<i>Three o'clock.</i>

360
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,592
Thanks, kiddo.

361
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:12,325
That's not the first time

362
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,634
you've waved somebody
under my nose.

363
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,470
That missionary...

364
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,602
followed you
all the way from Brazil.

365
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:21,407
Do I have to hear
about her again?

366
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,209
I mean it's ancient history.

367
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,079
Clean food and American toilets

368
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:27,141
is what looked good
to her, not me.

369
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,779
Everything she ate
down there gave her the runs.

370
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,813
Why do you have
to give every little detail?

371
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,620
You always were one
to pull the curtains.

372
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,422
Some things are private.

373
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,824
You mean hidden...

374
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,388
Pretending.

375
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,527
Your dead husband's
photograph on the mantel

376
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,869
and flowers on his grave
on Decoration Day.

377
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:49,965
And there you were

378
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,636
with all the good widows
at the cemetery.

379
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:54,804
Then you'd come back home
and hop back in bed with me.

380
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,473
I can't talk to you.

381
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:57,640
You sure used to.

382
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:58,649
I'm going back to my room.

383
00:21:58,683 --> 00:21:59,911
Fine.

384
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:12,496
Used to be we'd make up
by doing the deed.

385
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,464
I'd stay after you until
I had all your clothes off.

386
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,504
<i>Don't you dare follow me.</i>

387
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:22,597
Baby, I'll only be in Brazil
for a month,

388
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,665
and the money is good.

389
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,608
My God...

390
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:30,341
A whole month
without your apple pie.

391
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,407
A month without the smell
of your hair.

392
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,349
A month without your eyes...

393
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,412
Shut up.

394
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,021
I'm still mad at you.

395
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,223
I know.

396
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,227
<i>I still feel it.</i>

397
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,203
I want you
just like I always did.

398
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,866
Not the way I am now,
plugged in like a lamp.

399
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:59,168
Well, it's that
time again, Hannah.

400
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,075
Let's put you on the toilet.

401
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,737
But I haven't eaten anything.

402
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,875
I don't need cleaning out
if I haven't eaten anything.

403
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,714
You know we do it
every three days.

404
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:08,719
It's on your chart.

405
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:11,381
But I'm not bound up, dammit.

406
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,721
Well, that's thanks to this.

407
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,885
My body's gonna forget
how to shit on its own

408
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,360
if you keep
shoving that up me.

409
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,225
Just leave me alone.

410
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,731
Hannah, we don't want
to have to restrain you.

411
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:22,392
Just try it.

412
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,561
Doctor knows
what's best for you.

413
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:27,002
I haven't seen that
little asshole in three months.

414
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,903
How does he know what I need?

415
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,636
Look, I don't get paid
a fortune for doing this.

416
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,440
I've got enough on my plate
without having to argue with you.

417
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,411
I don't have the time.

418
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,778
There's more to
taking care of people

419
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,806
than reaming them out
every other day.

420
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,477
Don't I have any rights?

421
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,707
<i>There's endless beauty
in Alaska, Rachel,</i>

422
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:07,040
<i>but some days
it's almost too much.</i>

423
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:12,846
<i>I want beauty I can hold...
You.</i>

424
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:19,621
<i>The bald eagles are just like
everything else here -</i>

425
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:21,921
<i>bigger than you can imagine.</i>

426
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,520
<i>And the mountains
grow like wildflowers.</i>

427
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,763
<i>It'd be heaven on earth
if you were here.</i>

428
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,503
<i>Rachel, what's so wrong
with wanting to see the world?</i>

429
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:38,498
<i>I can't spend my life
lookin' out just one window.</i>

430
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:42,309
<i>But mountains, eagles,
Broadway marquees -</i>

431
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,645
<i>what's any of that
when I hold it up to you?</i>

432
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:48,618
<i>Well, I gotta sign off.</i>

433
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,248
<i>This is gonna cost me an arm
and a leg in postage as it is.</i>

434
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,454
<i>I wish you'd write.
A penny postcard, something?</i>

435
00:24:57,595 --> 00:25:01,429
<i>Don't stay mad.
Please...</i>

436
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,491
<i>I had to leave.</i>

437
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,333
<i>I couldn't stay there
and see you with him.</i>

438
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:10,841
<i>I love you, Rachel,
I truly do.</i>

439
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:13,070
<i>And I wish you well.</i>

440
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,545
<i>Think of me sometimes...</i>

441
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,016
<i>Your old friend,
Hannah Free.</i>

442
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,719
Hannah, wake up.
It's time to go see Rachel.

443
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,352
I found her room.

444
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,623
The coast is clear.

445
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,096
Let me just
get your wheelchair.

446
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,429
Uh, do you have to
go to the bathroom?

447
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:37,525
I'm sorry, yes, I do.

448
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,093
I always have to go
when I wake up.

449
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,866
No big deal.
Do you use a bedpan?

450
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:41,872
No!

451
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:44,374
Don't you let her go
in that bathroom with you.

452
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,535
Get a grip on yourself.

453
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,205
Get a grip on me;
Let me help you up.

454
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,714
I can't believe I'm finally
gonna get to see her.

455
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:53,376
Don't wake me.
I'm sleeping soundly.

456
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,385
We'll be quiet.

457
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,215
What?

458
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,220
Ghost.

459
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,051
Don't call me a ghost.

460
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,556
These aren't my slippers.

461
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,218
Yeah. Bought you a new pair.

462
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,556
What, are you adopting me?

463
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,720
Maybe.

464
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:05,228
You are hard up.

465
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,230
Lean on me.

466
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,391
Bring the chair.
I can do it, I can get in.

467
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,560
You're always
so darn independent.

468
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,070
Always so damn independent?

469
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,129
Right here.
Lock the wheels.

470
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,647
I appreciate this.

471
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,779
<i>Dammit, Linda!
Dammit, Linda!</i>

472
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,397
I'll just be here,
out of the way.

473
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:25,699
God, you could run a farm
on all this fuckin' machinery.

474
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:28,904
All these goddamn tubes.

475
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:31,972
Poor kid.

476
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,612
You go ahead and sleep, Rachel.

477
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:43,415
I just wanna be here.

478
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,451
We were together all our lives.

479
00:28:56,934 --> 00:29:00,995
Together and apart...
Right, Rach?

480
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,139
It's just that I've
never seen her

481
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,441
look unattractive
at all in some...

482
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,106
in makeup.

483
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,275
And I said, I said...

484
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:13,749
Oh, bring your husband...

485
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,150
Gimme, gimme!

486
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,582
Hannah!
You're in the wrong room.

487
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,421
No, I'm not.

488
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,450
Look, Hannah,
you should be asleep.

489
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,553
You're gonna get yourself sick.

490
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:28,429
How in the world
did you get yourself in here?

491
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,933
I drove.

492
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:34,927
Hannah, you know how
her family feels.

493
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:36,940
I'm her family.

494
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,276
Let's take you
back to your room.

495
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,868
No!

496
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,142
What is the harm?

497
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,479
Rachel should not
be here alone,

498
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:48,610
not now,
not just before dawn.

499
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:52,745
That's the soul's midnight.

500
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,282
And that's the time
all us old folks die.

501
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,625
Trust me,
people die all day long.

502
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,301
Please let me stay.

503
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,668
I'm sorry, hon, but you're
not supposed to be in here.

504
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,469
Let's wheel you
back to your room.

505
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,304
- No!
- Hannah...

506
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:11,808
No!

507
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:15,939
Hannah, you are not
the only person in this home.

508
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,811
I've gotta get
back to the desk.

509
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,976
- You come with me.
- Leave me alone!

510
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:21,814
This is my great grandma.

511
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,482
I brought Hannah here tonight.
I take full responsibility.

512
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,354
I haven't seen you before.

513
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:29,359
I flew in a couple days ago.

514
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:30,621
Now look.

515
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:33,653
This is
Grandma Rachel's best friend.

516
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,825
Of course she should be here.

517
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,336
It's a funny time of night
to come visiting.

518
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,463
It gives them more privacy.

519
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,973
Why don't you just
go on back to your desk.

520
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:50,075
Well, maybe for another
15 minutes,

521
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,514
then you take her
back to her room.

522
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,451
I don't wanna find her
in here when I check again

523
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,511
at... 3:45.

524
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:01,252
I'll take her back at dawn.
She's not hurting anyone.

525
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:08,354
Oh, all right.
I guess she's not.

526
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,664
But if that daughter of hers
comes before Hannah's gone,

527
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,863
I didn't see
either one of you.

528
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,429
- Deal.
- Okay.

529
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,310
What a load of bull.

530
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,716
I think I'm rubbin' off on ya.

531
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,547
I hope so.

532
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:31,214
Did ya hear that, Rachel?
I get to stay.

533
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,271
This is Marge.

534
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,252
I want to make sure that...

535
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:04,584
King me.

536
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,055
Okay...

537
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,941
Hannah, I'll check in
with you later, okay?

538
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,610
That Greta...
she reminds me of somebody.

539
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,278
I'm not lookin' at her.

540
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,226
Even the squirrels
move slow around here.

541
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,831
Pretty day.

542
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,946
<i>Yes, sir, I was in the CCC.</i>

543
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:09,851
We planted
rows and rows of trees.

544
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:14,824
Lots of discipline...
Good preparation for WW II.

545
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,123
And what did you do
after the war ended?

546
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,659
Whaddya mean 'ended'?

547
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,332
Oh.

548
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:25,392
Say, aren't you Betty Grable?

549
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:30,333
Greta? Why, I had no idea
you were in town.

550
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:31,341
Nope.

551
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,343
Weren't you gonna stop by?

552
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:34,844
Wasn't planning to.

553
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,346
Are you a friend of Betty's?

554
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,347
Betty?

555
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:38,643
Betty Grable.

556
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,686
Uh, sir, I would like you
to meet Tallulah Bankhead.

557
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,518
I'm sure that's
some kind of insult.

558
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,854
What kind of a name
is Tallulah?

559
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,519
What are you doing here?

560
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,687
Same thing you are - visiting.

561
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,027
Well, that's nice, I guess.

562
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,589
If you won't
spend time with me,

563
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,861
at least you're visiting Mom.

564
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,869
I enjoyed talking with you.

565
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,537
Have you seen my horses?

566
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,371
No!

567
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:07,877
Maybe you should
check down the hall?

568
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,209
Much obliged.

569
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,212
Save me a dance, eh?

570
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,385
Well, how long are you
gonna be in town?

571
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:19,889
As long as I want.

572
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,755
Must you be so rude?

573
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:24,227
Yes, I think I must.

574
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:26,286
I messed up with your mom.

575
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,093
I wish I could do it over.

576
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,060
That's something.

577
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,131
Please stop by
for lunch some day.

578
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,967
I'll think about it.

579
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:40,738
Maybe I'll even bring my lover.
She likes a good lunch.

580
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,575
Oh, is this some
kind of test?

581
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,740
It's just the truth.

582
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,409
Why am I not surprised?

583
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,145
Yeah, why aren't you?

584
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,582
You just knew I was
gonna turn out bad, huh?

585
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,283
I didn't mean...

586
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,884
I need to, uh...
make sure they turn Mom.

587
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:57,894
I don't think
they do it often enough.

588
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,589
Marge? Grandma?

589
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,892
Yes?

590
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,528
Make sure you're
not doing it again...

591
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:06,536
screwing things up between
Great Grandma and Hannah.

592
00:35:07,304 --> 00:35:09,431
I don't know what you mean.

593
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:11,134
I'll bet you don't.

594
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,609
It's sad, it's really sad.

595
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,704
It's not the same thing.

596
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,806
It's not
the same thing at all!

597
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,331
<i>Can you believe Katie
got in trouble again?</i>

598
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:13,836
I'm not that surprised.
She gets in trouble a lot.

599
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,701
We better not.

600
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,510
There.

601
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:24,844
Don't do that.

602
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,349
Don't wipe away my kisses.

603
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:27,941
You want me to
go get Dewey Russell?

604
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:28,849
You wanna kiss him?

605
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,854
I don't want to kiss anybody.

606
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,515
So it's not just me?

607
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:35,024
Especially not you, Hannah.

608
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,026
Rachel!

609
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,755
If you don't
feel funny about this,

610
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,353
why are we
in this chicken coop?

611
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:40,693
I'm shy.

612
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,529
Don't laugh at me.

613
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,432
I wasn't laughing at you.

614
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,266
It's just
you make me nervous...

615
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:49,864
like you're gonna
kiss me again.

616
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,374
Do ya want me to?

617
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:52,534
No...

618
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,378
Yes.

619
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,715
Oh, my.

620
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,376
You liked it?

621
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:02,044
Why aren't you a boy?

622
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,714
Do you really want me
to be a boy?

623
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,552
No...

624
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,217
You kiss me this time.

625
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,227
I have to go.
I have chores to do.

626
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,558
Meet me here Saturday.

627
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:13,222
We're going into town
for supplies.

628
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,232
How 'bout Sunday after church?

629
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,564
I can't do this on a Sunday!

630
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:19,398
Monday after school?

631
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:21,996
All right.
But just for one kiss.

632
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:33,076
<i># Rachel, Rachel #</i>

633
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,575
<i># Give me your answer do #</i>

634
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,900
<i>One, two.</i>

635
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,702
<i>You're gonna be awake all night,
drinking coffee.</i>

636
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,802
Oops! I'm sorry.
More mail.

637
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:04,507
My, you are popular.

638
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,845
You get more mail

639
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,283
than all the other people
in this place put together.

640
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:11,113
That's pretty damn sad.

641
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:13,282
Hmm... Hallmark?

642
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:16,254
That's for me to know.

643
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,825
Awww...

644
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:21,023
You look very
tired today, Hannah.

645
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,794
Couldn't you sleep last night?

646
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,966
Now if your eyes are tired,

647
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,129
I'd be very happy
to read that...

648
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,036
I can still read!

649
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,303
Well, would you like
to buy some stamps?

650
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,972
I haven't any money up here.

651
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,071
Yes, you do.

652
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,674
Your little friend left $20
next to the front desk

653
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,947
so you could buy yourself
some little extras.

654
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:44,044
You want me to get you
a pop from the machine?

655
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,555
Guess not.

656
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,559
Well, the offer stands.

657
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,060
I'll be back tomorrow.

658
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,655
You are always
gettin' somethin'.

659
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,338
I suppose there are some people
who think she means well.

660
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,637
Wars break out
every other week

661
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,940
'cause of some asshole
who means well.

662
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,365
What do you think?

663
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,661
You think anyone in here

664
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,691
knows you're gonna
be my lady tonight?

665
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:34,704
"My Lady."
Wow... Unbelievable.

666
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:42,871
<i>So... who's that from?</i>

667
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,937
Friend.

668
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,539
New Mexico?

669
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:47,880
Yes, and don't get all agitated.

670
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,385
Look at me.

671
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,219
One minute...

672
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,554
thirty seconds...

673
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,718
I'm going back to my room.

674
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,523
No, wait, wait, wait.

675
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,325
I'm paying... attention.

676
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:03,562
Your mind's in New Mexico.

677
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,192
She's just an old friend.

678
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,071
I'm sure after all those years
working at Los Alamos

679
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,766
she glows in the dark.

680
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,241
Don't tell me how
that woman glows in the dark.

681
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:15,074
When I'm gone, you'll probably
conjure her up for company.

682
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,579
Her life is full.

683
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:17,739
You like that about her.

684
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:19,146
Yes.

685
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:22,417
Honey, you don't
have to envy her.

686
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,086
She was no match for you.

687
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,750
You always said she was witty.

688
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:29,349
So are you.

689
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:33,095
Why doesn't she visit you?

690
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,261
I'm sure that Jackie wants
to remember me the way I was.

691
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:42,904
I guess I would, too.

692
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,065
I don't want to
see me in her eyes.

693
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:51,443
So...
Are you coming tonight?

694
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,449
Hope so.

695
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,950
That girl's bringing you?

696
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,918
It's the only way
I can get there.

697
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,784
Why is she helping you?

698
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:01,621
Because I'm just so
fascinating she can't resist.

699
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:02,784
Oh, speak of the devil.

700
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,293
- Hi.
- Hey!

701
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,523
I was here earlier,
but you were napping.

702
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:07,962
I'm surprised you're out of bed.

703
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,967
I'll have you know I've been
up here roaming the halls.

704
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,765
Wow, kid, you really know
how to have a good time.

705
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:16,298
So how are you?

706
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,138
Tired...
And grateful.

707
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,541
No problem.

708
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:23,139
I left you a little money
at the front desk.

709
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,374
Now you've
got them tipping you.

710
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:25,540
I hope you don't mind.

711
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,015
I just know
that you can't keep money

712
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,915
up here in your room
or else it might get stolen,

713
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:31,318
so this way you can
treat yourself to something.

714
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,822
She is thoughtful.

715
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:34,653
Well, thanks, kid.
I don't want anything.

716
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:36,488
Not even a stamp?

717
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,121
Pair of shoelaces?
A magazine?

718
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:40,561
Read? Tie a shoe?

719
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:42,622
God it makes me tired
just to think about it.

720
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:46,965
I had so much energy,
but I squandered it.

721
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,899
Now my body parts
are all worn out.

722
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,000
But I'm still here.

723
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:56,479
Got my hands,
my heart, my mind...

724
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:59,004
I'm refining myself
down to the essentials.

725
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:02,514
So we goin' on vacation
again tonight?

726
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,350
- You willing?
- I am askin'.

727
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,515
- Three o'clock?
- I'll be here.

728
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,819
Thanks.

729
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,856
It's all right.

730
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:11,884
Hey...

731
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,362
I wanna give you something.

732
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:15,858
I thought of what
you might like.

733
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:18,197
Just keep
your clothes on, Hannah.

734
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,668
In there.

735
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:31,676
It's my journals.

736
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,683
You'll find the Depression
in there someplace.

737
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:35,877
You mean it?

738
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:37,147
You'd let me read 'em?

739
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,552
I can quote from 'em?

740
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,216
I thought somebody should
get some good out of 'em.

741
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,226
I'll try to skip over
all the personal stuff.

742
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,488
It's all right.

743
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,655
If you can read
my handwriting, honey,

744
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,562
you're welcome to 'em.

745
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,794
So there you go.
Maybe you'll learn something.

746
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:51,960
I bet I will.

747
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,560
I bet she will.

748
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,231
See you tonight.

749
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,398
It's a date.

750
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,578
<i>It's a date.</i>

751
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,573
Aren't you just
the nursing home Romeo.

752
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,173
Well, she is pretty cute.

753
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:11,047
Something 'bout the way
she walks reminds me of you.

754
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:15,584
You have such a great ass.

755
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,992
Is that why you couldn't
keep your hands off of it?

756
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:21,259
Near death has really
brought out your racy side.

757
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,756
You old flirt.
You never let me read those.

758
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:25,597
You're in 'em.

759
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,433
I hope you were kind.

760
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,132
Not always...

761
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:30,937
They're not just journals.

762
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:33,272
I wrote a novel
when I was snowed in.

763
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,039
Beat alcoholism.

764
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,341
Am I in that too?

765
00:43:38,982 --> 00:43:41,280
I think you'll
recognize yourself.

766
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,286
Why'd you give them to her?

767
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,287
I want somebody
to know I was here.

768
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,792
Well, I know.

769
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:52,351
I want somebody to know
you were here too.

770
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:54,696
The real you -

771
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:57,427
not the you smiling
at church bake sales.

772
00:43:58,568 --> 00:44:00,695
I wanted people
to know about us...

773
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,040
who's not afraid
of what 'us' means.

774
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,611
I want somebody to know

775
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:13,343
that I took you to bed...
and I loved you.

776
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,486
We know.

777
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,818
Yeah, but what about posterity?

778
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:20,152
Posterity?

779
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,157
Yeah.

780
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,852
Good Lord, what next?

781
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,658
Well?

782
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:26,663
Well what?

783
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,324
What are you doin' in here?

784
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:30,659
Isn't this my room?

785
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:31,963
No!

786
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,266
You old men
are in the basement.

787
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,238
Go ask the nurse
to show ya.

788
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:38,500
I'm lost.

789
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,075
I know you're lost.

790
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,740
Ask the nurse
to take you to your room.

791
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,009
Do I know you?

792
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:50,849
I wish I had a picture
of you when you were younger.

793
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:52,445
What's your name?

794
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,693
You wanna take a guess?

795
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:57,853
No.

796
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:00,863
Well, then tell me
who you are.

797
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:04,693
How soon do ya
have to know?

798
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,362
<i>Here you are.</i>

799
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:10,369
He never knows
where his room is.

800
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,034
Come on, let's get you
back to your room.

801
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:13,440
I know you.

802
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,209
Not anymore you don't.

803
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,715
Your friend,
she don't talk much.

804
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,943
You should take a nap.

805
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:26,385
Your little friend will be

806
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,220
waking you up
before you know it.

807
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,022
I used to wake you up.

808
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,728
I'd wake up and my nightgown
would be unbuttoned.

809
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:45,237
Honey, it's light out.
I've gotta get up.

810
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,300
It's cold outside the covers.

811
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,911
Gotta feed the chickens,
make breakfast for the kids...

812
00:45:51,948 --> 00:45:53,609
I'll feed the chickens.

813
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,088
Take your long johns off.

814
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,683
You first.

815
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:12,533
It is cold.

816
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,420
I hope that's not in
those books you gave that girl.

817
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,300
I wonder if she has
a little girlfriend.

818
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:49,535
I'll bet you anything
that she's just like us.

819
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:56,335
I never could convince you
that we weren't the only ones.

820
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:01,876
You never thought
what we did was right.

821
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:04,646
Don't be silly.

822
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,617
Didn't we sit
on my front porch

823
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:09,716
holding hands,
watching the sunset?

824
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,023
Maybe not when we were 30,
but when we were 60.

825
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,156
Well, then they just thought

826
00:47:15,198 --> 00:47:16,961
we were a couple
of cute old ladies.

827
00:47:18,034 --> 00:47:20,002
No one ever thought
you were cute.

828
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,605
Everyone in this town
knows what you are, Hannah,

829
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,165
so they know about me too.

830
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:28,643
<i>I sat there
knowing full well</i>

831
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:30,873
<i>I was hanging out
my bed sheets.</i>

832
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,814
<i>It meant so much to you</i>

833
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,818
<i>that I finally just
let go of my privacy.</i>

834
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:43,419
<i>And let people,
family, neighbors...</i>

835
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,429
<i>know exactly who I am.</i>

836
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,754
Now...

837
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:51,460
You show me somebody
in one of your magazines

838
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,469
from California that does that.

839
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:58,608
I stood my ground,

840
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:01,076
lived my life,

841
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:03,443
and I loved you...

842
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,778
despite everything
I was brought up to believe.

843
00:48:15,258 --> 00:48:16,691
I'm tired.

844
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,558
So am I.

845
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,234
I wish we could
take a nap together.

846
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,406
I'll be there.

847
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,249
Quiet around without them.

848
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,549
I'm sure they're having

849
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:47,522
a great time
camping with the Wilsons,

850
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:48,421
mosquitos and all.

851
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,926
The Wilsons are
a little churchy for me.

852
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,326
I suppose you want me

853
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,421
to find some heathens
to take my children camping.

854
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,091
Might be more fun.

855
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,099
Ohhh!

856
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,909
It's almost time
for Arthur Godfrey.

857
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,501
You want me
to turn it on for you?

858
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:11,109
He makes you fall asleep.

859
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:12,774
I need my rest.

860
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:16,843
Mmm... that's good.

861
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:36,465
I already pulled the shades.

862
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:29,081
<i>You keep after me to write you
more than three sentences.</i>

863
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,916
<i>It took me half an hour
to find a pencil,</i>

864
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,945
<i>but here goes.</i>

865
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,819
<i>The ground is frozen.</i>

866
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,054
<i>We've had snow.</i>

867
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,789
<i>The Canada geese
are on the lake,</i>

868
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:41,694
<i>taking a rest
on their way south.</i>

869
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,167
<i>I miss you, Hannah.</i>

870
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,669
<i>I wish you'd stay home,
but at least this time</i>

871
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,433
<i>I know you're doing war work.</i>

872
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,405
<i>New Mexico sounds beautiful.</i>

873
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:54,903
<i>You've been having dinner</i>

874
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:57,003
<i>with the same woman
all the time.</i>

875
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:59,014
<i>What's that mean, 'dinner'?</i>

876
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:02,540
<i>Well, I'm not knitting you
any more warm socks,</i>

877
00:52:02,585 --> 00:52:04,644
<i>if you're down there
'having dinner'</i>

878
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:07,417
<i>while I'm up here
squirming in my sleep.</i>

879
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:11,223
<i>I know people read your mail,
so I won't say any more.</i>

880
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,893
<i>I don't know
how many more times</i>

881
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,695
<i>I can let you leave me.</i>

882
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,326
<i>At least I'm busy.</i>

883
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,734
<i>I'm working
three days a week</i>

884
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,670
<i>at the hardware store,
bookkeeping.</i>

885
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:23,933
<i>The man who used to</i>

886
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:25,565
<i>keep their books
is serving in Italy.</i>

887
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,904
<i>I'm so thankful
you're not overseas.</i>

888
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:33,975
<i>Be careful
in New Mexico, Hannah.</i>

889
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,882
<i>Watch out for snakes.</i>

890
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,716
<i>Check your boots.</i>

891
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,221
<i>Come home soon.</i>

892
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,148
<i>You know I love you,
but I'll say it anyway.</i>

893
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,659
"Know ye the Lord,
He is God;

894
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,358
it is He
that hath made us,

895
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,493
and not we ourselves;
we are His people..."

896
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:53,331
Who the hell are you?

897
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:55,894
"...and the sheep
of His pasture.

898
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,497
Enter into His gates
with Thanksgiving..."

899
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,030
I said who the hell are you?

900
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,839
"...and into His courts
with praise."

901
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:05,181
You can't just waltz in here
and start spoutin' over me.

902
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,683
Mary, I'm here to help you.

903
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:11,517
And my name's not Mary.
Don't call me Mary.

904
00:53:11,554 --> 00:53:15,183
It says Mary H. Freed
on your door, Mary.

905
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,750
Well, I don't give a
rat's ass what the door says.

906
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,786
Profanity is not the language
of our Lord.

907
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,424
Don't you want salvation?

908
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:24,626
Don't you want to sleep

909
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,862
in the loving arms
of Our Lord Jesus Christ?

910
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,370
No.

911
00:53:28,404 --> 00:53:30,872
Now Mary, you don't mean that.

912
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:35,571
My name is Hannah...
Hannah Free.

913
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:40,379
No one has ever called me Mary,
not even my own mother.

914
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:41,781
So why don't you just

915
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,378
go talk to some other poor joker
who can't talk back.

916
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,048
I can see I haven't caught you
on a very good day.

917
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,058
I don't have good days anymore.

918
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:52,528
Knowing Jesus
would lighten your burden.

919
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,790
Believe me...

920
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,061
"The Lord is Good;
His mercy is Everlasting."

921
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,728
So you're on the road to Heaven?

922
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,237
I have my mansion reserved.

923
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,570
And I'm going to hell?

924
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:08,236
If you don't accept Jesus Christ
as your personal savior.

925
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,516
You paint a pretty
mean-spirited picture of Jesus.

926
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,247
Don't you think
that Judgment belongs to God?

927
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:21,780
Mary, you are an old woman.

928
00:54:21,824 --> 00:54:24,759
God may be
calling your name soon.

929
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,422
The next time the friendly
hand of Salvation

930
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:30,432
reaches out to you, Mary,
I'd grab it.

931
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,094
My name isn't Mary.

932
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,536
It's the name you
were baptized with.

933
00:54:35,571 --> 00:54:38,233
It's the name
the Lord will call.

934
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,367
What a friend we have in Jesus.

935
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,207
Never forget that, Mary.

936
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,503
Have a nice day.

937
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:56,190
You can have your mansion!
I'll be just fine in hell!

938
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,188
I hate this about gettin' older.

939
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,996
Think I'm just flappin' my gums
to stir up a breeze.

940
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,466
Rachel?

941
00:55:15,678 --> 00:55:16,906
Rachel?

942
00:55:20,516 --> 00:55:23,314
Well, if you're not gonna come
I'll get a radio...

943
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,514
drown out those
crazy people in the hall.

944
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,488
Course they probably think
I'm crazy too.

945
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,493
Sittin' here alone
talkin' my head off.

946
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:44,969
Jesus, someone's got
"As The World Turns" on?

947
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:46,975
What in the hell
are they doin'

948
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:48,476
spendin' their
last minutes on earth

949
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,138
listening to
"The World Turns"?

950
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,841
I know.
You loved that show.

951
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:57,550
Lisa and Nancy and Dr. Bob.

952
00:56:02,558 --> 00:56:05,118
Bedpan. Full.

953
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:12,894
Rachel?

954
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:18,199
One last game of checkers?

955
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,104
I'll let you win.

956
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,214
My turn?

957
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,719
- Yeah.
- Okay.

958
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,215
King me.

959
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:36,748
Shit.

960
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:39,789
I don't think that was fair.

961
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,866
I'm gonna have that kid
bring me a radio.

962
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,664
I can choose my own noise.

963
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,340
You don't hear
anything, do you, Rach?

964
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,441
You're barely here.

965
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,756
You're tryin'
to leave us all behind,

966
00:57:10,793 --> 00:57:12,317
and they won't let you.

967
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,900
Rachel...

968
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,101
Are you still there?

969
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,287
Guess I shoulda knocked.

970
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,887
Yes, you should have.

971
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,627
They yours?

972
00:57:52,668 --> 00:57:54,033
Yes.

973
00:57:55,671 --> 00:57:57,696
You were busy
while I was in Alaska.

974
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,303
Still pissed at me?

975
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:05,075
Yes. And must you
use that language?

976
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,949
Yes.

977
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:11,046
You didn't write
you were coming.

978
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,486
Didn't wanna warn you.

979
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:13,887
You just visiting?

980
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,324
Are you a widow?

981
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:20,829
Yes.

982
00:58:20,863 --> 00:58:22,490
I believe I'm back.

983
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:26,566
I appreciated the money
you sent me from Alaska.

984
00:58:26,602 --> 00:58:28,661
I didn't want to use it.
I shouldn't have...

985
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:31,104
You don't have
to explain, Rachel.

986
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,768
In fact...
I wish you wouldn't.

987
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,813
I wasn't paying for anything.

988
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,707
If you ask me upstairs,

989
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,186
I don't want you
mixed up about why.

990
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,711
I haven't asked.

991
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:52,884
I bet you will.

992
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,197
I'm a mother now.

993
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:58,534
So?

994
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,195
Get out!

995
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,362
I'm sorry.

996
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,201
You left me, remember?

997
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,536
You got married!

998
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:07,042
I didn't think that meant
I was going to lose you.

999
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,545
If I had stayed,
what were we supposed to do?

1000
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,047
Trade recipes?

1001
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:14,379
I needed you, Hannah.

1002
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,544
Don't need me...

1003
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,679
Want me, Rachel.

1004
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:21,389
It isn't right.

1005
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,551
Why? Because Mr. Johnson
went belly up

1006
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:25,561
in the lake like
a dime store goldfish?

1007
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,563
Only you would
put it like that.

1008
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,565
This is right for us, Rachel.

1009
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,403
Tell me you don't want it.

1010
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,438
You know, up in Alaska

1011
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,909
when they're lightin' dynamite
someone'll yell,

1012
00:59:41,944 --> 00:59:44,105
"Fire in the hole!"

1013
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,777
I think that kinda sums us up.

1014
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,418
You're just terrible.

1015
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:54,855
The more you shake your head,

1016
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,858
the wilder you are
under the sheets.

1017
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:00,755
Put those babies
down for a nap.

1018
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:05,263
If we start...

1019
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:11,135
<i>If we start...
promise you won't leave?</i>

1020
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:17,203
Cute babies.

1021
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,611
They got names?

1022
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:19,945
Promise?

1023
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:22,780
Tomorrow I want you
to bake me some biscuits

1024
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:25,013
wearin' nothin' but this apron.

1025
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:28,317
Hannah, I need an approximation.

1026
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:29,449
How long will you stay?

1027
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,460
I don't know.

1028
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,394
I don't wanna know.

1029
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:36,660
Rachel, I need life
to surprise me.

1030
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,298
If I bake you those biscuits...

1031
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:47,574
will you promise
to stay till spring?

1032
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,843
You make me those biscuits
I'll stay through the summer.

1033
01:01:02,024 --> 01:01:04,322
Maybe till the fall...

1034
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,658
You can carve me up
for Halloween.

1035
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,670
Let's put Marge and Roy
in their cribs.

1036
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:19,766
Marge and Roy?

1037
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,276
Yes, Marge and Roy.

1038
01:01:22,878 --> 01:01:24,869
I shoulda been here
to help you name 'em.

1039
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,806
I gotta go home soon, Mama.

1040
01:02:30,846 --> 01:02:33,337
You know how Mason
has to eat on time.

1041
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:37,148
When I started
coming up here every day,

1042
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:38,744
he said that was my business -

1043
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,653
just so long
as I got home in time

1044
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:41,747
to cook his supper.

1045
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,691
And I do. Faithfully.

1046
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:49,125
Sometimes I cheat a little bit,

1047
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:52,066
mix it up ahead of time
and heat it up in the microwave.

1048
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,762
He doesn't seem to care.

1049
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:55,361
Just so long
as when he sits down

1050
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,634
at exactly 5:30
and leans forward with his fork

1051
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,732
he's got something
to stick it into.

1052
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:05,008
My goodness,
sounded a little racy.

1053
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:08,813
And we both know
Mason is anything but racy.

1054
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,820
The only time he gets romantic
is after the Super Bowl.

1055
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,788
I talked to Roy.

1056
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:20,091
He said that he can't
fly down right now.

1057
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:24,327
His youngest is still
in drug rehab,

1058
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:27,961
and Linda is on
her third divorce.

1059
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,138
He does have his troubles.

1060
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:35,767
Glad my family never
got into that dope.

1061
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:38,405
At least not that I know of.

1062
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:42,850
Course you never can tell
about Barbara's girl, Greta...

1063
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:46,150
I know. You warned me.

1064
01:03:46,188 --> 01:03:49,646
I said, "Barbara,
you have a choice to make.

1065
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:52,183
You can either ruin your life
with that godless commie

1066
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,855
or you can come home."

1067
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,160
What are they gonna do
in a big town like Minneapolis?

1068
01:03:56,198 --> 01:04:00,362
He's a passionate young man...
and she loves him.

1069
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:02,836
Marge, don't make her choose.

1070
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:05,102
Mama, he's a Buddhist!

1071
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:11,877
<i>I could never understand
why a woman with your good sense</i>

1072
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,974
<i>would spend her life
with that darn Hannah.</i>

1073
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:24,856
<i>It's wrong.
And everybody says it's wrong.</i>

1074
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:26,919
<i>The Bible says that it's wrong.</i>

1075
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,330
<i>Not that I would ever
admit that you did</i>

1076
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,630
<i>what everybody in this town
knows you did.</i>

1077
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:36,770
<i>If somebody baits me,</i>

1078
01:04:36,805 --> 01:04:40,832
<i>I just say
how weird Hannah was,</i>

1079
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:46,075
<i>and that you have always been
kind enough to stay her friend.</i>

1080
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:51,879
Not that you two didn't have
your knockdown, drag out fights.

1081
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,822
I would hear you
through the heating vents.

1082
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,688
The two of you would
rather lose an arm

1083
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:59,387
than say anything
against each other in public.

1084
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:04,224
I should do that with Mason.

1085
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,499
At least he doesn't
bore me with his talk.

1086
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:12,840
He doesn't ever
really listen either.

1087
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,640
Did Hannah ever listen to you?

1088
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,645
I guess she did.

1089
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:26,416
She finally stopped traveling
and stayed home.

1090
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:32,722
You would always look at her
like she could cure cancer.

1091
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,862
She wants to see you, Mama...

1092
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,700
and I want you
to die in peace.

1093
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:46,168
And Hannah never
brought you peace.

1094
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,278
I've gotta go.

1095
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:51,404
Mason's gonna be

1096
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,438
cuttin' that placemat up
into tiny little squares.

1097
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,713
I love you.

1098
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:59,112
Goodnight. Sleep tight.

1099
01:05:59,154 --> 01:06:00,553
I'll see you tomorrow.

1100
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:15,633
Why can't you
do that in the garage?

1101
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:18,640
'Cause it's cold out there
and there's not enough light.

1102
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,307
Besides, you're in here.

1103
01:06:22,344 --> 01:06:23,641
Oh, baloney.

1104
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:26,871
Why don't ya
come to bed, huh?

1105
01:06:26,915 --> 01:06:28,883
I could wear something else
to Lily's funeral.

1106
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:30,782
My bowling shirt's clean.

1107
01:06:32,354 --> 01:06:34,219
It's not like I'm gonna be
the star attraction.

1108
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:35,553
They're all gonna be
lookin' in at Lily

1109
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:36,819
to see what hair color
they went with.

1110
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:38,486
Wait.

1111
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,552
You know I've never been
good at waitin'.

1112
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,387
Come on.

1113
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:49,902
Your neck hurt?

1114
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,682
I'll never get over this.

1115
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:14,529
Now you kiss me.

1116
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:31,205
You're in so much trouble.

1117
01:07:31,246 --> 01:07:32,508
Get in here.

1118
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:37,886
<i>Dear Jackie,</i>

1119
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,481
<i>You write such lively letters
I can't compete.</i>

1120
01:07:41,523 --> 01:07:43,218
<i>We don't do much
whitewater rafting</i>

1121
01:07:43,258 --> 01:07:45,419
<i>up here at the home.</i>

1122
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:48,828
<i>Yes, I think about New Mexico.</i>

1123
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,731
<i>But that's not where
my life is...</i>

1124
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:53,792
<i>My life's here.</i>

1125
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,361
<i>I guess it always was.</i>

1126
01:07:56,405 --> 01:08:00,865
<i>Go watch the sun rise over
the mountains for me, will ya?</i>

1127
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:04,606
<i>And good luck
with your golf swing.</i>

1128
01:08:04,646 --> 01:08:06,773
<i>Yours truly...</i>

1129
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:14,784
<i>Much love, Hannah.</i>

1130
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:18,316
Hi.

1131
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:20,925
Hey.

1132
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:23,764
Feeling down?

1133
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:24,925
No.

1134
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:29,600
Why do you keep
comin' back every day?

1135
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:30,900
If I was your age,

1136
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:32,566
I sure as hell
wouldn't be wastin' my time

1137
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,940
listenin' to some
old broad beat her gums.

1138
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:38,105
Well, maybe you just weren't
as sensitive as I am.

1139
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:41,244
Hannah?

1140
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:42,617
Still here.

1141
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:44,619
I hope you won't be mad.

1142
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:45,483
Don't worry.

1143
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,284
Whatever it is,
you can outrun me easy.

1144
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,455
You know those books
you loaned me?

1145
01:08:50,492 --> 01:08:52,119
Yeah what happened to 'em?
Your dog ate 'em?

1146
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,788
Hannah, they're wonderful.

1147
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:57,632
Especially the novel.
I couldn't put it down.

1148
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,133
So what's so bad about that?

1149
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,136
You said it wasn't any good.

1150
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,297
Well, that's what I was told.

1151
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:05,568
Hannah, I hope you
won't be upset...

1152
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:09,407
I faxed the first chapter to
this professor friend of mine.

1153
01:09:09,444 --> 01:09:11,776
She loved what she read.

1154
01:09:11,813 --> 01:09:13,644
And if you let me
send her the whole thing,

1155
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:15,309
I know she'll publish it.

1156
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:19,582
It's not a big
New York publishing company,

1157
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,486
but people could
read your book.

1158
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,284
Jesus, I'd love to see that.

1159
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,759
But you'd better tell 'em

1160
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,489
not to keep it too long
at the printers.

1161
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:29,997
- Hannah!
- Well...

1162
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:32,000
Why wasn't it
published years ago?

1163
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:35,299
Hell, I tried.
I sent it out.

1164
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,067
And I got it back. A lot.

1165
01:09:38,106 --> 01:09:43,476
Some guy at Random House
or Scribners

1166
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:47,744
wrote me a really lousy letter.

1167
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,512
He said he wanted to

1168
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:51,519
'save me from further
embarrassment'.

1169
01:09:51,553 --> 01:09:53,350
Why? Because it doesn't have

1170
01:09:53,388 --> 01:09:56,289
some guy jacking off
in a bullring in Spain?

1171
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,153
I suspect the reason was

1172
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:02,186
because it was about
two women together.

1173
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,699
But it's good.
Doesn't that count?

1174
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,257
Happens all the time, honey.

1175
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:09,795
What the hell.
I've had a good life.

1176
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:12,170
I did what I wanted,
pretty much.

1177
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,205
Except now.

1178
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,577
Well, even now...

1179
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,411
if I could
just be with Rachel.

1180
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,615
It's not so bad

1181
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:24,744
coming to the end
if you're not alone.

1182
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:28,018
Shit. You're awful.

1183
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:32,052
So why do you
keep comin' back?

1184
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:33,220
The truth?

1185
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,559
Always.

1186
01:10:34,596 --> 01:10:37,394
She really is
my great grandmother.

1187
01:10:37,432 --> 01:10:38,729
She who?

1188
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,496
Rachel.

1189
01:10:40,535 --> 01:10:43,003
I wasn't lying when
I told the nurse that.

1190
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:45,232
Are you kiddin'?

1191
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,901
No, I'm not.

1192
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:48,739
But I met all her family.

1193
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,506
And you met me.

1194
01:10:50,545 --> 01:10:53,139
Years ago, you took me fishing
so I wouldn't hear

1195
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:56,014
Marge and my mom
fighting about Daddy.

1196
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:58,383
And we never came back
to Michigan after that.

1197
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,978
But I always remember

1198
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:03,048
Rachel's hot chocolate
and going fishing with you.

1199
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,449
You're Barbara's girl.

1200
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:09,220
And you were wearing
a yellow dress.

1201
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,760
Boy, I sure didn't
have you figured.

1202
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,530
I had you figured.

1203
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:16,264
You and Rachel.

1204
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,439
I came out a couple years ago...

1205
01:11:20,475 --> 01:11:22,943
I've always had
crushes on girls.

1206
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,276
So you want me to be
your lesbian heritage?

1207
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:27,772
You gonna write
a song about me?

1208
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:30,148
I just wanted to
get to know you better.

1209
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,085
You and Great Grandma Rachel.

1210
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,654
Jesus Christ...

1211
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,784
That means Marge
is your grandmother.

1212
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,316
Sorry.

1213
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,726
That's why I wanted you

1214
01:11:40,762 --> 01:11:43,162
to get to like me
before I told you.

1215
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,634
So...

1216
01:11:46,668 --> 01:11:48,568
You seen the old battle-ax?

1217
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:50,264
Only once up here.

1218
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:52,398
And not on purpose.

1219
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,875
And last year
at Mom's funeral.

1220
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,976
Rachel and I were
in here by then.

1221
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:05,077
Mom was kind of like
how Rachel is now...

1222
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,714
Lots of tubes and machines.

1223
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:10,758
It was up to me.

1224
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,127
I had to let her go.

1225
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:19,232
I wish I could do that
for Rachel.

1226
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:22,765
Well, why don't you?

1227
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:27,408
I mean, what's the worst
anyone could do, arrest you?

1228
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:30,002
Lock you up somewhere?

1229
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,013
Got a point there, kid.

1230
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,940
You must hate
seeing her like this.

1231
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:42,482
I just don't know
if I've got the guts

1232
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,151
to say that last goodbye.

1233
01:12:47,562 --> 01:12:49,689
- Hey.
- Hey.

1234
01:12:49,731 --> 01:12:51,699
What are you doing
with that suitcase?

1235
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:53,360
What suitcase?

1236
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,165
The one under the bed.

1237
01:12:55,203 --> 01:12:57,603
You just kicked it under there
when you heard me coming.

1238
01:12:58,673 --> 01:13:00,470
Where do you think
you're going?

1239
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:03,203
The Himalayas.

1240
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:05,873
Why?

1241
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,882
I just need a change.

1242
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,514
Michigan doesn't
have any mountains.

1243
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,543
I mean, I know
you've got the Porcupines...

1244
01:13:12,587 --> 01:13:14,214
Michigan has me.

1245
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,883
Well, you could come.

1246
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:18,415
Hannah, I'm older than dirt.

1247
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,758
Right. And you've never
crossed the state line.

1248
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,525
I've never needed to.

1249
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:26,891
What are you looking for?

1250
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:31,235
I don't know, exactly.
I just need something different.

1251
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:34,242
Different just for the sake
of different?

1252
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,035
Yeah.

1253
01:13:36,778 --> 01:13:40,145
Well, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard in my life,

1254
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:43,242
and I've been listening
to you for over 40 years.

1255
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:44,582
I'll be back by spring.

1256
01:13:44,619 --> 01:13:45,916
Don't you dare!

1257
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:46,579
What?

1258
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:49,818
If you walk out that door,
don't come back!

1259
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:52,224
Get your junk out of my garage!

1260
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,057
And don't send me
a Christmas card!

1261
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:55,756
Just go. Go!

1262
01:13:55,797 --> 01:13:56,764
Jesus.

1263
01:13:56,798 --> 01:13:59,699
Don't you know
where your home is?

1264
01:14:01,169 --> 01:14:03,262
Don't you know that yet?

1265
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,104
Hannah, a dog
is smarter than you.

1266
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:09,269
Well, what about what I want?

1267
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:15,181
All our lives have been
about what you want.

1268
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:18,482
This is about what I want.

1269
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,954
You've had your chance to roam.

1270
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,651
Now, dammit, stay home!

1271
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:27,184
Sit on the porch with me,
and mow the lawn.

1272
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:30,255
Put your clothes in the closet.

1273
01:14:30,298 --> 01:14:31,993
Clean the cat box.

1274
01:14:32,033 --> 01:14:35,799
Don't just visit...
be with me.

1275
01:14:35,837 --> 01:14:38,670
I know every inch
of this place -

1276
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:42,734
every flower, every nail,
every bullfrog.

1277
01:14:42,777 --> 01:14:45,541
There's just never
anything new for me to see.

1278
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:50,117
If you can't find yourself,

1279
01:14:50,151 --> 01:14:54,986
be yourself,
here with me,

1280
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,991
where can you?

1281
01:14:57,025 --> 01:15:00,392
- Rachel.
- It's not out there...

1282
01:15:00,428 --> 01:15:02,259
It's here.

1283
01:15:03,865 --> 01:15:05,230
I'll try...

1284
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:08,495
I'll try.

1285
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,032
Do better than try.

1286
01:15:36,898 --> 01:15:38,695
It's almost dawn, Hannah.

1287
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:41,702
Just let me sit with her
for a few more minutes.

1288
01:15:41,736 --> 01:15:43,226
Well, sure.

1289
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,136
Look, we don't have
to do this tonight.

1290
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,039
We can wait till tomorrow.

1291
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:51,773
I never liked doin' that.
Neither did she.

1292
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:54,304
Wash the dishes now,
don't leave 'em.

1293
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:55,873
Right, Rachel?

1294
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:57,248
<i>It's time.</i>

1295
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:02,652
Rachel...

1296
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,659
What am I gonna
do without you?

1297
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:07,892
You'll never be without me.

1298
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:15,062
I look at you two
and that's what I want.

1299
01:16:16,771 --> 01:16:19,569
I'm just sorry you never
got to really know Rachel.

1300
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:23,567
I do...
Through you.

1301
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:25,842
<i>Goodbye, kiddo.</i>

1302
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,914
Shit, I heard that.

1303
01:16:31,953 --> 01:16:36,583
So, finally it's your turn
to leave me, huh, Rachel?

1304
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,952
I just wish we coulda had
Greta and her gal over.

1305
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:46,093
You know, sit and eat
your potato salad on the porch?

1306
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,761
Wouldn't we have liked that?

1307
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:52,170
We coulda gone to
visit Greta in Minneapolis -

1308
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:54,368
if I ever coulda
gotten you outta town.

1309
01:16:56,478 --> 01:17:01,939
Ah, Rachel, there are parades
and festivals, newspapers,

1310
01:17:01,983 --> 01:17:04,281
and women's bookstores,

1311
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,483
that we never
in our wildest imaginings...

1312
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,453
I just wish it
could've come sooner.

1313
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:18,822
So, is that, is that,
uh, is that the one?

1314
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:21,392
'Cause I don't wanna
just unplug the clock.

1315
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,470
You're sure this is
what you want?

1316
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:29,170
Hannah, I've had a full life -

1317
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:32,737
oh, my God,
what a life -

1318
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:34,510
but it's over.

1319
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:37,017
Let it be over,
please, Hannah.

1320
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:42,148
<i>What is going on here?</i>

1321
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,158
I'm giving your mother
her life back.

1322
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,659
You get away from her!

1323
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,127
Grandma, let go of her.

1324
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,527
Where do you get off?

1325
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:51,157
Hannah's just trying to do what
you should've done months ago.

1326
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,190
You wheel her down here?
How could you?

1327
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:54,826
She has every right to be here.

1328
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:55,665
She does not!

1329
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:57,331
Of course she does.
They're lovers.

1330
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,669
Oh, I hate that word.

1331
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:01,005
I don't give a shit.
That's what they are.

1332
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:01,838
You shut up.

1333
01:18:01,876 --> 01:18:03,173
<i>You shut up.</i>

1334
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:05,338
You have no idea
what this is about.

1335
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,506
Of course I do.

1336
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:08,675
Just stop it,
both of you.

1337
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:10,682
Marge, I'm glad you came.

1338
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,380
Oh, I bet you are.

1339
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,049
It's time, Marge.

1340
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:18,757
You and I oughta
do this together.

1341
01:18:20,061 --> 01:18:23,861
It's not about you;
it's not about me.

1342
01:18:23,898 --> 01:18:25,661
It's about her.

1343
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:29,930
We both love her.

1344
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,337
And saying goodbye to her...

1345
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:38,638
hurts us more than
anything in this world.

1346
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,272
But it's time.

1347
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:44,714
I can't.

1348
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:46,721
She's ready to go...

1349
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,484
We gotta let her go.

1350
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:51,919
I love her so much.

1351
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:57,255
And I've always been
so jealous of you.

1352
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,227
And I always
wanted her to myself.

1353
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,238
Did you hate us?

1354
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,336
I never hated you.

1355
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,904
Remember the moonflowers?

1356
01:19:15,116 --> 01:19:16,947
I still have some
in my garden,

1357
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,419
but I'm the only one
who appreciates them.

1358
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,081
I would.

1359
01:19:21,122 --> 01:19:22,749
<i>Please.</i>

1360
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,759
What was that?

1361
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,260
Her.

1362
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,921
Can't be.

1363
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:29,088
Listen.

1364
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:30,597
<i>Please.</i>

1365
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:36,297
She said please?

1366
01:19:36,971 --> 01:19:39,030
She wants you
to help her, Grandma.

1367
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:45,744
Why don't you
turn off the I.V.

1368
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,943
Greta...
You unplug that.

1369
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:53,447
If anyone asks,
if there's ever any trouble,

1370
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,115
I will say I did it.

1371
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,087
It's okay.

1372
01:20:25,186 --> 01:20:26,881
I'll be so lonely.

1373
01:20:39,033 --> 01:20:40,398
Oh, Mama...

1374
01:20:43,304 --> 01:20:44,669
I love you.

1375
01:22:04,285 --> 01:22:05,616
Rachel.

1376
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:21,268
Wait! Wait for me!
