1
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,957
- Don't touch me.
- I'm chatting to you.

2
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,554
- Shut up.
- Where you going? Where you going?

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,232
There better be something
in your fucking eye, blood.

4
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,232
- Who the fuck are you?
- Balance, man.

5
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,709
Hey! That car's shabby, blood.

6
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,429
- Who's my man looking at, though?
- Fucking kids.

7
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,080
Why is he showing what he's got,
like he's a big man?

8
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,470
- He's an idiot, man.
- A man like that ain't nothing around here.

9
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,189
You know what? Fuck it, let's jack
this bre, man. Are you man on it?

10
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,238
Course. That man there
should be sharing the wealth, man.

11
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,197
Yeah, I'm on it still.

12
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,271
- Me and you, Dabs, yeah?
- What?

13
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,828
Yeah. All right.
Yous two wait here.

14
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,831
Come on... Nah, man. Am I a dickhead?
Why am I waiting here for?

15
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,799
This happens all the time.
Am I a dickhead, though?

16
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,670
I'll take the passenger side.

17
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,069
Come on. For fuck's sake.

18
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,878
Come on.

19
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,950
- Fuck! What are you doing, you fuckers?
- Let go of me, blood!

20
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,349
You fuckers! What are you doing?
You fuckers!

21
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,032
It's a fucking gun!

22
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,629
Argh!

23
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,518
Argh! Argh!

24
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,431
- What you get?
- Watch. What'd you get?

25
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,590
- Nothing.

26
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,875
Fuckers!

27
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,550
Hey, keep your chin up.
Stay out of trouble.

28
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,557
Say my name!
It's Jay, on a hot thing!

29
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,192
What, my man?

30
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,830
I told you,
I'll blow your man later, innit.

31
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,434
- Jay, get off the phone.
- Hold on, man.

32
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,875
I'm banging at that Polly gash.

33
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,190
No, not that one, blood,
the one from...

34
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,510
- Yeah, yeah...
- Jay! I'm gonna be late for uni.

35
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,239
Can't you see I'm busy, like?

36
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,359
I'm a business, babe. Like a doctor.
I gotta be on call. You get me?

37
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,349
Hey, blood.
I beg you bell me back, yeah?

38
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,158
Safe.

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,038
What did you want to tell me
that's so important it can't wait?

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,588
Can you at least pay attention to me
when we're fucking?

41
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,750
Hey, listen, shut your mouth, man.

42
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,195
I do pay you attention, babe.

43
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,435
Didn't we shave my name into your pussy
hair the other night, huh? That's attention.

44
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,508
We'll finish off, yeah?

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,715
Aw! Has he gone to sleep?

46
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,395
Oh, shut up, man!
This ain't happened to me before.

47
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,031
Oh... maybe once.

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,392
Now, you better swallow.

49
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,751
Go away, man!

50
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,629
<i>First day out, man.</i>
<i>So what you gonna do?</i>

51
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,949
Dunno, blood.

52
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,951
See my mum.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,309
Just wanna have a peaceful day.

54
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,039
You're simple, cuz, man.

55
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,353
I'm gonna get me a couple of girls,
get fucked all day, man.

56
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,470
Sweet boy like you must have a ting
you used to bang, man.

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,718
Babe.

58
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,790
- Do you wanna get some breakfast?
- Yeah.

59
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,229
- See you soon then, mate.
- Fuck out, man.

60
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,390
Sam.

61
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,436
You need something... anything...

62
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,034
just give me a bell
and I'll sort it, yeah?

63
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,032
Yeah. Bless, Big Man.

64
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,275
Hey, Chinatown!

65
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,555
You still owe me that fuck,
you know.

66
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,269
Now, your cousin said
if she couldn't pay, you would.

67
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,432
So tomorrow,
my money, my drugs, or you.

68
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,317
I gotta go work.

69
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,870
- What?
- You gonna take that from her?

70
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,835
I remember that one chick.

71
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,196
- I went back to her house, bruv.
- What happened?

72
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,352
Her dad came home, innit,
so man had to jump out the window.

73
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,876
I was running down the street in my
boxers and my socks. I was pissed.

74
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,837
Oh, shit, you'd feel pissed...

75
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,992
- Sorry, would you like to sit down?
- Thanks.

76
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,356
You cool, blood?

77
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, I'm bless, man. You?

78
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,275
Yeah, man.

79
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,271
I'm good.

80
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,551
I'm Jahvon, blood.

81
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,271
Do I know you, cuz?

82
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,679
No, bro.

83
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,876
Can't a man chat?

84
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,315
Yeah, man, safe.
Talk, innit.

85
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,117
It's not safe, though.

86
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,352
What you move for? We're having a little
chat - I chat to you, you chat to me.

87
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,874
What you getting nervous for?

88
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,875
Just come out of jail, man.

89
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,872
That shouldn't make you feel nervous.

90
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,039
That should make you feel good.

91
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,358
What'd you go in for?

92
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,194
What'd you go in for, blood?!

93
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,758
I don't wanna chat about it.

94
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,070
Bet I guess what you went in for.

95
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,549
Don't tell me, let me guess.

96
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,598
I think you hurt someone.

97
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,592
I'm thinking someone died.

98
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,395
Like you killed them or something.

99
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,358
You're a clever one,
ain't you, blood?

100
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,435
I don't think you
stabbed no one, though.

101
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,557
You don't look like the type.

102
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,313
If you was gonna
do something to a bre,

103
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,994
I think you'd use a baseball bat.

104
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,753
- Low it, man. Low it!
- My fucking cousin, blood!

105
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,273
What's this about, blood?
What's it about?

106
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,875
You ain't gonna survive this day.
I guarantee it!

107
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,428
Man's coming for you.

108
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,954
Your mum, your family, everything!

109
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,793
Who's coming?
Who's gonna hurt my mum?

110
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,598
Who, blood? Who?

111
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,116
Mum! Roy!

112
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,958
Come from yout offenders?

113
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,554
What you in for?

114
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,073
Killed one yout.

115
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,078
Don't feel you're big in here
just cos you killed someone.

116
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,754
Enough man in here done that.

117
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,196
Some of them man ain't even affected.
You get me?

118
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,678
You are.

119
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,069
I can see it in your eyes.

120
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,877
Who gave you that black eye?

121
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,593
Listen, blood, watch them man.

122
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,600
See my man there?

123
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,432
They don't get on.

124
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,559
Trust me, don't let any of them see
you're weak, blood.

125
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,632
You want something?

126
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,631
You keep watching me.

127
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,793
Whenever you and your boyfriend
are ready, you can see what go on.

128
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,988
What's your dad's name, blood?

129
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,157
Dunno. I ain't got one. Why?

130
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,435
Cos, like, my mum
tried to introduce me

131
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,229
to some broke-down yellow-teeth
waste man, yeah, called Cedric.

132
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,869
And hear this - he's coming into my house
telling me about how he's my dad.

133
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,952
But I'm like,
"You're not my fucking dad."

134
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,271
He had that ting Michael Jackson
said he's got. He looked like a panda.

135
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,954
I said, "Move from my house
with your polka-dot skin..."

136
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,713
Why's he taking so long, man?

137
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,955
Yeah!

138
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,749
I swear my maths teacher
lives somewhere round here.

139
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,751
And she's buff, blood.
I wanna fuck that.

140
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,479
I could quote algebra
while I'm in the pussy.

141
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,233
Q=Z means "Yeah!"

142
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,790
Get me? Why do you think
she's always giving me As?

143
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,838
You don't get As, blood.

144
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,273
- Who don't?
- Fool.

145
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,275
Don't get it twisted. Just cos I'm with you,
don't think I'm stupid. I got plans.

146
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,713
Although I might have to bang
my English teacher as well.

147
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,075
Who? Mr Randall? You batty...

148
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,549
No, man. Shut up.
It's a woman, man. You know that.

149
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,475
- Yo, blood, it's broad daylight, man!
- If you're shook, leave, innit.

150
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,871
Yes, Ike.

151
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,549
What you man got?

152
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,315
That ain't fake, man.
I got it last night.

153
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,914
I'll give you six for both tings.

154
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,309
What?
Six, blood.

155
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,639
You know what? I'll throw in a piece
of yay each. You'll have to wait, though.

156
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,915
I gotta go, bruv.
I got a mark-up booked, innit.

157
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,389
Safe, man. We'll wait here.

158
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,350
All right, later, you man.

159
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,829
You man wait here.
I gonna deal with a little ting.

160
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,876
Yeah, yeah.

161
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,194
Yeah, come we play this.

162
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,957
- Hey, pass the controller.
- Tss!

163
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,031
- What?!
- You deaf, blood?

164
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,192
He said pass the controller.
You fool.

165
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,475
Hey, I'm Arsenal, blood.

166
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,349
Who was it?

167
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,396
Omen and Dabs and them man.

168
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,919
So you understand
what I was saying to you before?

169
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,910
Yeah.

170
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,798
Even my man had to
learn the hard way, you know.

171
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,154
See this?

172
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,071
Some fucker done that to me.

173
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,993
You're all right.
I'm not into face-cutting.

174
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,629
Something about the face
makes people too angry.

175
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,473
But he was right to do what he did.

176
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,597
I took the fucking piss like you are.

177
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,755
You know what, blood?

178
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,477
I don't even know
this Curtis brother. Hm?

179
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,710
But he was trying to do his ting.
You understand?

180
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,509
And Andreas here, he fucked up.

181
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,309
And now us man,
we're trying to do our little ting.

182
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,831
And you are fucking up.
You understand?

183
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,912
- Yeah, bruv, but I was...
- Uh.

184
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,798
Listen, we like you, blood.

185
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,155
I like you.

186
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,356
But I can't have you
making money off of my shit.

187
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,873
- It's mine.
- I... I...

188
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,757
Now you're gonna
have to learn, blood.

189
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,310
Argh!

190
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,830
Oh, fuck! Argh!

191
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,751
Safe.

192
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,714
Where'd you park?

193
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,075
About three roads away.

194
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,037
Come on, we'll have a walk.

195
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,157
I've got to meet Jon and Vern
at the shop.

196
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,312
You're one lazy cow,
do you know that?

197
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,472
I'll go and get it and them,

198
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,471
- Yeah.
- Giz a kiss.

199
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,838
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

200
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,432
Hayden!

201
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,954
Shh!
Claire. Claire. Shh!

202
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,077
I'm not gonna hurt you, I swear.
I just wanna speak to you.

203
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,752
Hayden!

204
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,557
Promise me you're not gonna scream.
Promise?

205
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,551
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah?

206
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,798
What do you want?

207
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,431
Some bre attacked me when I come out.
Said people are gonna hurt me, my family.

208
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,511
I don't want that.
I done my fucking time.

209
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,149
- What'd you come to me for?
- Have you seen my mum anywhere?

210
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,153
That was six years ago.
I haven't seen any of them.

211
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,470
I haven't seen your mum
in, like, a year.

212
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,314
- What about my brother? You seen him?
- No!

213
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,710
Claire, you must know something.
Just tell me anything, please.

214
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,870
Moony goes Central University.

215
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,838
That's all I know.
Now just fuck off and leave me alone.

216
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,277
I don't wanna get involved in any of this.

217
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,709
- D'you want something?
- Mind your business.

218
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,678
What?
Who the fucking hell are you?

219
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,314
- Do you know him? Is he bothering you?
- Yeah.

220
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,676
All right, jog on, bruv, yeah?
Do yourself a favour and fuck off.

221
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,274
Hey, blood, don't fucking touch me!

222
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,635
What part of me
looks like your fucking blood?

223
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,438
Sam, just fuck off.

224
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,316
Sam? Fucking Sam?
Fucking Sam, yeah?

225
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,995
She still has nightmares because of you.
She flinches if I move too quickly.

226
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,914
- You fucking wrong 'un!
- I'm just talking to her. I've finished.

227
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,594
- Leave it.
- I'm all right, mate. I'm all right.

228
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,071
Like you said, you're finished, so do
yourself a favour and fuck off. Yeah?

229
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,788
Go and get in the car, babe.

230
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,791
You've had a squeeze.

231
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,351
Hey, babe.

232
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,398
Robert, you know we've got basic ethics
and understanding of law on Monday?

233
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,358
I could really use some help
getting my head around it.

234
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,197
Yeah, of course. Anything I can do. Give
me your number and I'll give you a call.

235
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,508
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later?

236
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,038
Bye.

237
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,030
- Don't think you're calling her.
- Of course not, babe. You're my girl, man.

238
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,915
- So, how was your class?
- It was all right...

239
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,718
Moony.

240
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,113
- How the fuck did you find me, blood?
- I saw Claire.

241
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,954
She said you went to that uni
and I just asked a few people.

242
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,076
- A guy try bore me up today.
- So?

243
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,039
He's telling me mans is gonna hurt my
family because of what happened to Trife.

244
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,078
Don't mention his name.
You have no right to say his name.

245
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,790
If it's you, if you're involved in this, I just
wanna tell you that I'm not on it, blood.

246
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,394
I'm not on dem tings no more.
We was all young.

247
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,472
I'm just about my studies,
money and my girl.

248
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,439
If you're not on it, you know how I feel.
Do you know where I can find them lot?

249
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,229
Just so I can tell them
I'm not into this beef ting.

250
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,515
Saw Becky a couple of months ago.

251
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,353
She works in that salon ting in Grove.

252
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,318
Don't know where Alisa is, and Jay...

253
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,110
You don't wanna see Jay. He ain't planned
nothing but he ain't forgotten you.

254
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,274
Yeah? Why don't you give me his number
so I can tell him that I want this over?

255
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,715
- Are you dumb, blood?
- Come on, man.

256
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,110
What d'you mean, "Come on, man"?
Don't talk like we're fucking friends!

257
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,512
You're any bre to me, understand? I ain't
forgiven you and I'm giving you nothing.

258
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,956
Can you two leave,
or I'll call the police.

259
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,789
Know why I'm studying law, blood? So
mans like you don't get out after six years!

260
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,474
- Tell Jay I want to see him.
- Are you sure you want that?

261
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,711
If I told Jay you're out,
you wouldn't need to look for him.

262
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,598
He'll find you,
and he will want arms.

263
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,232
Dickhead!

264
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,112
It's a ball, but I suppose you can come.

265
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,995
You'd have to dress up a bit, mind you -
I've had the best week.

266
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,991
I don't want your fucking life story.

267
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,676
I told my friends you've got the best shit
on the street, cos that's what Giles does.

268
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,911
Put your fucking hand down, blood.
You're baiting me up, man.

269
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,912
I'm not being funny,
but I've got a barbecue to go to.

270
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,513
Oh, shit!

271
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,079
Just relax, man.

272
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,756
- Give me my shit before they come back.
- I told you to put your hand down.

273
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,549
- Blood, if I had to run, yeah...
- Jason, don't be such a drama queen...

274
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,076
What the fuck do you think...
You ain't getting shit, bruv.

275
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,549
Oi! You! Stand by that pole! Now!

276
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,509
Furthermore, yeah, take all your
fucking shit and put it in my bag, blood.

277
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,433
What have you got on you, man?
What the fuck you got on you?

278
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,351
Give me your fucking ring.

279
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,477
Please! That's her engagement ring.
It's French 17th century.

280
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,838
Shut the fuck up, man! Hurry up, blood.
Put the watch in the bag as well.

281
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,514
Blood, hurry the fuck up
or I will shank you, man.

282
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,990
Jay, just let us go. I'm a good customer.
I'll give you anything.

283
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,277
You, blood? I don't need
your lickle business, man.

284
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,875
You're anything to me, blood.
The amount of white man I get.

285
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,077
What?
What, you think you're big, Giles?

286
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,551
Show your yuppie girl you know where
to score to impress her? You're a pussy.

287
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,950
Let me show you
what a little pussy you are, blood, yeah?

288
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,231
Show me your titties.

289
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,232
Before I murk your man.

290
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,710
For goodness' sake,
just show him the titties!

291
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,430
Run! Tammy, come on!

292
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,478
Are you mad, bruv?
The fuck you doing, bruv?

293
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,430
The fuck you doing, man?!

294
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,556
Hold on, yeah?

295
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,472
Hello? Jahvon.

296
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,189
What you saying, man?

297
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,072
What?

298
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,993
Sam? What, at the cemetery?

299
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,469
Where's he now?
Fuck him, blood!

300
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,518
He's a dead man!
He's dead tonight.

301
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,071
Nah. No, you go home, blood.
I'll get Moony and handle it.

302
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,837
You better thank God
something else has come up.

303
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,469
- Well, thank him, then!
- Thank you, God! Oh, thank you, God.

304
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,755
Get out of here, man.

305
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,151
Arsehole!

306
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,276
Tammy!

307
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,670
Max? Can I just...
please nip out for a?

308
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,877
Make sure you wash your hands
when you get back in.

309
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,913
Come outside.

310
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,752
One second.

311
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,592
Hey, cokehead!
Where's your fucking cousin?

312
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,877
- Think I don't know what she tried to do?
- Fuck off. Is this a joke?

313
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,748
It ain't no joke. My man showed me that
she tried to move to him at the drinks ting.

314
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,717
And you were there skinning your teeth.

315
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,553
You thought because I was on holiday
I'd forget about it?

316
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,438
Listen, your man
pushed himself up on us, yeah.

317
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,796
If your tings ain't tight enough
to keep his dick pointed at you...

318
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,440
She ain't even fucking worth it.
Where is she?

319
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,478
I don't fucking know where she is.
I don't care where she is.

320
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,953
Forget this. Find your fucking cousin and
both you get back to whoring yourselves.

321
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,600
What? You think I don't know about you?
Listen.

322
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,591
We all know about you.

323
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,753
Shiners for a fiver.
And you're fucking for a score.

324
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,833
- I never did any of that.
- So what about for a bit of coke?

325
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,753
Is that why I've heard
you've had all them dicks inside you?

326
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,990
- You fuck... Ow!
- What you saying?

327
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,718
Come off me, man.

328
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,237
- What the fuck is going on?
- She flipped out and attacked me.

329
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,995
Anna, Lisa, go to lunch. Now! Go. OK!

330
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,991
Yeah, that's...

331
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:17,317
Now, look, Lexi, I know you've been a bit
stressed. I want you to take a few days off.

332
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,995
Please don't fire me! I need this job.
I can barely afford to pay my rent...

333
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,108
I'm not going to fire you.
Come in on Tuesday. All right?

334
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,318
Today I want you to go in there,
get your stuff, and go home.

335
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,078
Sorry, ladies,
that will not happen again.

336
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,474
Can I speak to Becky, please?

337
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,836
What do you want her for?
Who are you?

338
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,678
Jay.

339
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,719
I don't wanna get involved, man.
I'm not scared.

340
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,998
But I'm about positivity,
like that black Jedi guy from <i>Star Wars.</i>

341
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,954
All right, I'll see you later. I'll see you
at Hammersmith later. I'll be there, man!

342
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,551
- Robert, what is going on?
- Low it, babe, yeah?

343
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,668
You don't remember me, do you?
Alex. Lexi, innit? Becky's cousin.

344
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,756
There's no reason you should. I was
two years younger and you was a cunt.

345
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,673
I left in year 11
while you was still in sixth form.

346
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,754
Picking on boys
and trying to fuck girls in year 10...

347
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,719
- So what d'you wanna see her for?
- I thought she might know who's after me.

348
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,271
Yeah, she might, but I ain't seen her.
No one has. She's fucked off, innit.

349
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,639
Look, yeah, I didn't know Trife well,
but... it's fucked-up he's dead.

350
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,351
- So do you know anything?
- Why the fuck would I know anything?

351
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,159
I know some of them lot from school
and through her,

352
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,959
but not well enough to know
who's after you.

353
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,838
Or to give a fuck for that matter.

354
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,151
Well, that's it, innit?

355
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,755
What else do you want me to say?
You've gone jail, come out - what?

356
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,675
I ain't got nothing against you, but I don't
think we got anything more to chat about.

357
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,876
Ask that girl you was banging,
they was mates.

358
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,589
Claire? I asked that chick already.
She don't know nothing.

359
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,955
That girl was grimy.

360
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,475
Always losing her knickers. After lunch
she'd not know where she'd left 'em.

361
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,269
I remember you now.
You was always on your own, innit?

362
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,909
Yeah. My boyfriend went to a different
school, so I didn't chat with boys.

363
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,150
Girls didn't like me, so...

364
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,789
I got to the point where I did more things
to piss 'em off. You get me?

365
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,270
Fuck it. If they ain't gonna love you,
make 'em hate.

366
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,873
I beg you a browns, Lex?

367
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,632
Who's your friend?

368
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,154
No. He ain't a friend.

369
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,913
Cool.

370
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,155
Yout!

371
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,831
- Safe for what you did, blood.
- I didn't do nothing, man.

372
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,038
Listen, I ain't trying to be
spars with you, you know.

373
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,830
You don't have to affiliate yourself
with me. I'm just saying safe, that's all.

374
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,434
Don't worry about it, boys.
It gets better.

375
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,798
I'm getting out tomorrow. Can't wait
to see my kids. You got any kids?

376
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,235
Know anyone that's got any kids?

377
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,958
Suit yourself.

378
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,197
Oi, Lex! What about Alisa?

379
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,033
You know some of them lot.
Can you get her to speak to me?

380
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,069
I've not spoken to her but I could get her
number. You know she had a daughter?

381
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,472
- Yeah. Can I have it?
- Her daughter? Oh, her number? No.

382
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,711
I'll get to her, see if she wants
to chat to you, but I doubt it.

383
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,633
I'm not high on the list of people
she wants to chat to either.

384
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,598
Here what. I got my mum's mobes,
I'll give you the digits.

385
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,514
I beg you bell mans
if she wants to speak or anything.

386
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,949
Yeah, safe for doing this, yeah?

387
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,759
Hey, can you get any gear and that?
Like, cheap?

388
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,558
Nah, man.

389
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,276
Oi, what's it like
knowing you've killed someone?

390
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,590
Blood, I need that ting off you now.
I don't give a fuck.

391
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,035
I want him dead.
I want him dead today.

392
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,230
Kill my boy. Now he's back in the ends
like he's big and I'm not gonna do nothing!

393
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,198
Just cool down, man.

394
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,709
- I'll give you seven for everyting.
- Cool, man.

395
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,635
- You gonna help me with this or what?
- Jay, man just got out of jail today.

396
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,757
If something happens to him,
friends are gonna come for you.

397
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,957
I don't care, blood. I'll go jail.

398
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,510
You know what, I'm gonna give you
the piece, cos me and you are boys.

399
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,276
Just don't bring no fucking drama
to my door, you hear me?

400
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,271
Course not.

401
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,148
You just gotta understand,
do you get me?

402
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,437
This boy... killed my tight bredren, man.

403
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,512
Listen, why don't you buy
a couple of the boys we got?

404
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,637
They'll do anything for a bit of cash.

405
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,837
Why don't you get 'em to do the job
for you, save you the trouble?

406
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,514
- And if they get caught, who gives a fuck?
- Who?

407
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,717
Don't put no pussyholes on it
who'll take my money and not do nothing.

408
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,190
This lot won't fuck about,
they're a tight little crew.

409
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,669
- Omen, Dabs, and some others.
- Omen?

410
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,069
Yeah. You know him?

411
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,835
Nah, not really.
Why? Is he here?

412
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,559
Dabs is still here.

413
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,076
- Go on, go through with Andre.
- Come on, then.

414
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,720
Cuz, you're not on my level
on this game, man.

415
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,315
Cuz, why do you think they call me
King Henry, bruv? Check out the header.

416
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,630
Look-look-look! Bang!
Check out the replay.

417
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,554
- Mine's stuck.
- Nah! Check out the replay.

418
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,154
Hey, Dabs. Come through, mate.

419
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,756
Now, man. Come on.

420
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,716
Let me have that.

421
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,750
Mum?

422
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,835
How you doing, mum?

423
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,831
Everything OK, like?

424
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,716
Came out today.

425
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,908
Did you do that
to the front door?

426
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,873
Yeah. I'm s... I'm sorry.

427
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,191
I just needed... I needed to get in.
No one was home.

428
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,151
I mean, I'll pay for it.

429
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,437
Gonna go try get a job.
I'll go Jobcentre or something.

430
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,674
You know, cos we get taught stuff
in there. You can still get jobs and that.

431
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,031
I missed you, mum.

432
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,351
Some toast?

433
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,788
Let me get this straight. You want me
to get Omen, find this yout and murk him?

434
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,598
Yeah.

435
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,555
- You sure you want him dead?
- Yes, man, are you deaf? Dead.

436
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,313
- Why's he getting excited?
- Who the fuck you talking to?

437
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,870
Look, let's just calm the fuck down.

438
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,117
Can you do it or what?

439
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,111
What's in it for me, like?

440
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,309
Listen, I like the way
you been going on recently, blood.

441
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,710
So what say you come flex
with me and Andre for a bit?

442
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,998
Step up a bit, get a little piece
of what we're going on with.

443
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,029
You better watch yourself.

444
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,588
All right, man.
I'm sorry, man.

445
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,477
Sorry, Ike, man.

446
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,519
But come the fuck on. Kill a bre for just
that? You must think I'm any road yout.

447
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,477
- I ain't doing that.
- Listen!

448
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,279
I'll give you three grand now.

449
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,319
And then three more when it's done.
I ain't chatting shit to you, all right?

450
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,755
Take the money and go find him.

451
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,550
- You know what? Seckle the fuck down.
- Blood, you need to watch your mouth!

452
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,720
- Who is it?
- Name's Sam Peel.

453
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,518
Sam Peel?

454
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,113
- You do know that...
- Don't worry about what I know.

455
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,272
- Yeah, but...
- You still gonna do it, blood?

456
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,470
- Know what? Rag on.
- Good.

457
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,074
And don't let the others know
who he is, blood.

458
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,950
No, I mean it, blood. Don't even
let them mans see his face too tough.

459
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,395
Just go get Omen
and do your fucking job.

460
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,278
You see him, you kill him.

461
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,194
- You do know what he looks like, yeah?
- Course, blood.

462
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,271
He robbed me when I was nine.

463
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,918
Yo, Henry!

464
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,036
- We're gone, blood!
- Tss!

465
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,629
Don't forget I've got the title, blood.
I beat you eight times.

466
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,358
That's Henry the Eighth.

467
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,353
What's wrong with these kids nowadays?!
They ain't got no respect, blood.

468
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,670
Always on a hype ting.

469
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,195
I didn't chat to my elders like that.

470
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,236
Here you go.

471
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,030
So what's going on?

472
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,992
- They want us to kill someone.
- What?! Who?

473
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,437
- I ain't supposed to tell you, blood.
- Come on, blood, I ain't gonna tell no one.

474
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,238
- Sam Peel.
- Who's that?

475
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,958
- You don't know?
- No.

476
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,192
But you know what, cuz, it don't even
matter. I ain't into all that stupidness.

477
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,953
You told them
it's all nonsense, yeah?

478
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,873
You're thinking about it, innit?

479
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,951
Blood, don't be stupid, man!

480
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,271
When I tell Omen and Blammy
they're gonna laugh in your face.

481
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,395
Tss!

482
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,759
Ike and them must think we're dickheads.
If you're thinking of doing it, you're stupid.

483
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,592
Who the fuck you calling stupid?

484
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,319
Blood, you're a dunce
if you kill someone for them fools.

485
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,709
Next man would do it twice
for that kind of Ps.

486
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,756
Get off me, man.
I don't even care!

487
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,799
I'm up for a little arms and robbing, man.
But you gone psycho, blood.

488
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,792
You shot man last night and now this.
I'm not going jail for you.

489
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,634
I'm not going jail for no one to call me
Abigail, call me some next man's chick.

490
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,790
Burn that, man.
You can go, man. Fuck you.

491
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,915
- Who the fuck are you talking to, blood?
- Get off me, cuz, yeah?

492
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,790
Calm down. What's wrong with you? I'm
supposed to be your friend. Calm down!

493
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,713
I'll catch up with you on Monday.

494
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,235
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mum.

495
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,675
- How was school today?
- All right.

496
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,231
Mummy's just got to see someone for a
bit, but then we're gonna go straight back.

497
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,519
OK, come on. Over here.

498
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,709
- You all right?
- What do you want?

499
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,870
Can I give you a lift home?

500
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,994
- OK, I'm gonna be in in a minute, OK?
- OK.

501
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,592
- Where'd you get my number from?
- She left her phone when she fucked off.

502
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,875
- So what you up to these days?
- Being a mum.

503
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,678
Safe.

504
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,916
I'm just working in a salon, innit.
I wanna get into...

505
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,833
What the fuck d'you want, Alex?

506
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,399
It's Lexi.

507
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,072
All right. Lexi.

508
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,072
You bell me, say you want to
talk about something important,

509
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,230
and now you're sitting
having a chitchat?

510
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,632
I don't mean to be rude, but one of the last
people I wanna have a social with is you.

511
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,199
Fine. Whatever.

512
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,034
That guy Sam's out. Someone's after him.
He wants to know if you know anything.

513
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,872
Well, I don't.

514
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,235
Now tell me,
why the fuck should I even care?

515
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,357
He deserves everything he gets.

516
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,237
Come on, Alisa. He's done his time,
he doesn't want any trouble.

517
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,189
So? I don't give a fuck about him
and I don't even know why I met you.

518
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,514
Actually, do you know what, I do.

519
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,991
I thought you were gonna tell me Becky
was hurt or homeless or something.

520
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,390
I wanted to see if I felt sad.
And now you tell me she's missing.

521
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,677
And do you know what?
I don't even fucking care.

522
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,194
I don't care about her, you, or him.

523
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,590
I don't even give a fuck either.
I just thought since he took time out

524
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,959
to find me and... and to see Moony
and Claire, that at least I would pass on...

525
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,031
- He saw Moony and Claire?
- Yeah.

526
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,680
He just said his piece and left.
What harm can it do?

527
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,876
All right. Call him.

528
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,875
But if he so much as raises his voice
to me, I'm calling the police.

529
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,279
You never came to see me.
Even when I was in hospital. Why?

530
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,395
You...

531
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,631
make me feel so shame.

532
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,911
I couldn't bear it.

533
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,755
More than one woman
lost their son that night.

534
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,918
- Lord God. What did I do wrong?
- You did nothing wrong.

535
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,516
I try to raise you on my own. I work every
hour God send me to provide for you.

536
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,310
- And what do I get? You, a murderer.
- It's different from murder.

537
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,153
And your brother.

538
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,913
He's gonna be worse than you are.

539
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,872
Maybe if I'd gone to church more.

540
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,832
I never meant to let you down, Mum.

541
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,070
You never meant to.

542
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,312
But you did.

543
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,668
I borrowed your phone.

544
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,389
Whenever you're ready, pussy.

545
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,438
Yout.

546
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,513
Wha' gwan, blood?
What you got?

547
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,193
Bre! I ain't had them crisp in time,
you know! Let me have your crisp.

548
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,635
- Tss!
- What? You say something?

549
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,554
Did you say something, blood?
Give me the fucking chocolate too.

550
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,508
My man got 'nuff batteries.
What you need them for?

551
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,433
- My shaver and...
- Nah, cuz! You don't need them.

552
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,193
Give me your batteries.

553
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,958
- I'm not giving you the batteries.
- What? You a bad man now?

554
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,953
You kill someone big? What was his
name? Tell me. See if I get shook of you.

555
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,871
- His name was Trife.
- What?

556
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,839
- His name was Trife.
- His name was Trife. Don't know him.

557
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,356
And you know what?
I'm taking your fucking batteries.

558
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,518
You?

559
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,315
Hello?

560
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,833
- That Sam?
- Yeah.

561
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,229
- It's Lexi.
- Yeah, what's going on?

562
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,517
- Alisa said she'll see you.
- Where?

563
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,070
Go Latimer Station, do a left
through the alley then bell me.

564
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,878
Safe.

565
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,753
What you doing, blood?
That's my chair.

566
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,671
- I'm next.
- Did I say that's my chair?

567
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,479
- I'm next.
- Shut the fuck up! I heard you first time.

568
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,199
Oi! Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

569
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,352
Come out the fucking shop.
You trying to fuck a man's business?

570
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,351
I'm coming back for him, you know.

571
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,316
Yo, Omen.

572
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,072
Wha' gwan, man?

573
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,436
What's going on, man?
What happened to your lip?

574
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,595
You know I'd do anything for you.
We like blood.

575
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,319
Yeah, yeah, man. Course.
Tell me, man.

576
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,392
Ike and Andre asked me to get you man
and kill some bre for six Gs.

577
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,630
- What? What for?
- I dunno.

578
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,790
Me and Henry said,
"Nah, we ain't on it,"

579
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,317
then we saw the bre and thought, "Fuck it.
May as well rush him." He bricked Henry.

580
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,437
I tried to fight my man
but he got away.

581
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,399
- So where's Henry? Hospital?
- I had to kick out before the feds came.

582
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,948
- You left Henry, blood?
- He was out cold.

583
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,918
I chased the bre, called an ambulance,
got Blammy, came here.

584
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,757
I was banging my yat. When Dabs called,
I just left her - legs up, gash out, everyting.

585
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,229
Let me call Henry, man.

586
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,754
Fuck this. Who's the bre?
I'll fucking do it. He's dead.

587
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,913
Dunno. But I'll recognise him, though.
I'll fucking recognise him.

588
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,993
- They said it's big tings for us, blood.
- You know what? Fuck their tings!

589
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,435
If this bre hurt Henry,
he's fucking done.

590
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,069
It's done. That's what I said.
Well, you on it or what?

591
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,236
You done know. Come.

592
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,591
Oi, Moons.
I swear I'm leave, like.

593
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,194
I just thought I seen my man
walking like he's big.

594
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,953
Nah. Nah, I'm coming to get you now.

595
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,473
- What did she say, like?
- Alisa?

596
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,553
Nothing. She just said bring him
and I said I'd sort it.

597
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,949
Why are you helping me?

598
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,913
- I saw Jay.
- What? When? What did he say?

599
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,391
Nothing. Well, I thought it was him -
he was on the train, I wasn't.

600
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,071
You all right?

601
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,515
- Is her kid here?
- Yeah.

602
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,959
- What do you want? Find God in jail?
- I understand how much you hate me...

603
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,316
You'll never understand
how much I hate you.

604
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,315
I didn't plan this. I didn't know what I was
gonna do today, I just wanted to get out.

605
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,676
But this guy attacked me and he's saying
people are gonna hurt my family.

606
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,548
I wanna tell you that if you know who's
involved, I don't want any more trouble.

607
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,632
- So this is about what you want?
- Come on, the guy's trying...

608
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,518
Shut up, Alex.

609
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,831
What about
all the people you've hurt?

610
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,276
What about what they want?
What about all the lives you've ruined?

611
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,318
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- You didn't mean it?

612
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,511
Wait here.

613
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,638
It's not going
the way you planned, is it?

614
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,478
What?!

615
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,869
Fucking prick!


616
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,109
OK. Go play with your toys,
sweetheart.

617
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,949
What about what she wants?

618
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,313
Like a dad? Which she doesn't have
because of you.

619
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:21,919
You think... I have time to sit around
and organise how to get you back?

620
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,070
D'you know what?

621
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,395
Mum?

622
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,953
Don't you ever... come near me
or my daughter again.

623
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,439
You either.

624
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,234
What you doing now?

625
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,673
I dunno.

626
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,513
I know it sounds dumb,
but it was good seeing you today.

627
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,956
It's good that you come out of jail,
and you're, like, all right.

628
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,510
Bell me sometime, yeah,
if you're bored or whatever.

629
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:17,549
Or if you're not doing nothing now, you
could just... go back to mine and just...

630
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,517
just whatever...

631
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,511
for a bit.

632
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,038
- Any of these bres?
- Nah, man.

633
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,998
- You heard this?
- Put it away, man.

634
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,556
Fucking hell, man.

635
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,033
Everywhere I go... Why the biggest guy
in the world always stand in front of me?

636
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,588
Yo, blood!

637
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,478
You get paid to follow me around
or something?

638
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,676
What?
You wanna say something to me?

639
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,196
You better chat slow, yeah, blood.
I don't speak Big Foot.

640
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,876
- Hey, that's him. That's the fucking bre.
- Come we get him, then.

641
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,875
Fuck round him
and knock him out.

642
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,751
Hey, man! Hey, pussyhole!

643
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,796
- Get the fuck up.
- Fuck up!

644
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,519
Get the fuck up! Stand up!

645
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,160
- I wanna see him.
- Fucking do it, man.

646
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,753
Fuck!

647
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,149
- That's not him, man.
- What?

648
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,515
It's not fucking him.

649
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,591
- Fuck!
- Might as well jack him.

650
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,159
- Fucking come here.
- Come on!

651
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,071
Shut up!

652
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,549
Shut up. What? Shut up. Sing.

653
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,790
- You deaf, pussyhole?
- Fucking sing.

654
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,952
- # Let me go
- Fucking dickhead. Get out of here, man.

655
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,871
I thought you knew
what the bre looks like.

656
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,999
I do, man.
I just made a mistake, innit.

657
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,398
It's Henry.

658
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,993
Hello?

659
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,316
What, blood?

660
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,119
That was his mum.

661
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,637
- He's not dead, he's just unconscious.
- So are we still gonna do this, or what?

662
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,631
Yeah, come.

663
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,073
Come in. We can have a fat spliff,
just cotch for a bit.

664
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,789
It's small. Hope it don't
remind you of jail too much.

665
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,235
- You want a drink?
- Yeah. What you got?

666
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,788
Um... water.

667
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,917
M-might have some Um Bongo
in the cupboard.

668
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,191
What's that?

669
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,870
Exzoryapan. It's, like, a...

670
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,110
It's an antidepressant... thing.

671
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,918
I get...

672
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,353
So what you doing tomorrow, like?

673
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,909
Why? That your way
of asking me to do something?

674
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,436
No, man. I was just...
No. I was just asking.

675
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,273
I never do nothing no more.

676
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,033
Get up, go to work, come home.

677
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,634
I spent six and half years
wishing I could do something

678
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,836
and you don't know
what you're doing tomorrow.

679
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,990
So what you doing?

680
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,436
- Something, man. Anything.
- Exactly. You don't know.

681
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,158
Well, what do you like doing?

682
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,515
I draw designs sometimes...

683
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,875
It doesn't matter. It's stupid.

684
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:00,475
You know what? You're the first bre
that asked me what I like to do in years.

685
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,313
- So where exactly is Becky, then?
- I don't know. She just up and left.

686
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,188
Got home four weeks ago - gone.
I ain't seen or heard from her since.

687
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,636
- You don't seem that bothered.
- No, I'm not.

688
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,350
- I've missed this, man.
- What?

689
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,958
Just cotching at a girl's yard, like. Just
little things, like going cinema and that.

690
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,072
- Shit... Oh, sorry.
- Oh, fuck!

691
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,549
Nah, it's all right.

692
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,951
Come here.

693
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,639
Come here.

694
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,035
<i>Oi, Moons!</i>

695
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,510
- What you saying, fam? You cool?
- No, I'm not cool. I'm vexed.

696
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,990
I thought I see him on the train, innit?
I swear I'm going mad, blood.

697
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,356
I wanted to spark him,
then I thought, "Let me calm down."

698
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,558
Let me come get you and let's do this
together, blood, like it should be done.

699
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,154
I got some little youts
looking for him as well.

700
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,676
- Which way we going, man? It's that way.
- Relax. Come in for a chat.

701
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,877
We ain't got time for no chat!
We need to go get him now.

702
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,351
- Hey!
- Shut up, you waste man!

703
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,510
You're all butters anyway!

704
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,192
Bitch!

705
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,555
Relax, Jay, man.

706
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,956
Hey, blood.
What you wearing, man?

707
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,591
You look like a fucking batty man, blood.
This better be for some uni project.

708
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,791
Jay... this is my girl Kayla.

709
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,795
Rah, blood!

710
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,993
So I don't see you in a couple of months,
yeah, and you got yourself a girl, blood?

711
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,675
Babe, check they didn't put no onions in it.
You know how you get.

712
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,638
- Are we gonna go get him or what?
- What exactly is going on?

713
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,838
- Robert ain't really filled me in.
- "Robert"?

714
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,876
All right. Basically, yeah.

715
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,873
This guy...
that killed our best friend...

716
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,556
just come out of jail, innit?

717
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,393
- And I want us to go get him back.
- And do what?

718
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,948
Blood, what's this girl on?
What you think?

719
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,634
- I'm not on it, bruv.
- What you talking about?

720
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,678
- I'm talking about Sam.
- He said he's not interested.

721
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,070
You speak for him now? Go suck out.
Who's talking to you anyway?

722
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,073
I don't know who you think you're talking
to, but you don't speak to me like that.

723
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,709
- Seckle yourself. Moony, tell your girl.
- Tell me what?

724
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,315
Listen, this ain't a dictatorship, "blood",
this is a relationship.

725
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,039
I'm a 22-year-old woman
who's studying law.

726
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,476
He does not tell me nothing.
We discuss things together, yeah.

727
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,189
Maybe if you was a man instead of a yout
in a man's body you would know that.

728
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,070
Hey, blood, I will spark your girl...

729
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,390
- Jay, don't chat...
- Don't speak for me.

730
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,712
Listen. On Earth, where I'm from, men are
supposed to treat women with respect.

731
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,873
If you ain't gonna chat to me with respect,
have your conversation away from me.

732
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,598
Move!

733
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,991
- What you looking at?
- You!

734
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,674
- Don't look at me, man.
- Come on, man! Just jam, man.

735
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,399
Jay, what's your problem, man?

736
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,159
- Fuck... Get off me!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

737
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,630
- You know what? Fuck this.
- Wait, wait. I will, I swear. Please. Fuck...

738
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,075
Just... Sam, give me a minute.

739
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,958
You all right, like?


740
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,268
Yeah. I'm fine.

741
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,194
So what you act like tings
is gonna run for then back out?

742
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,111
It's just...

743
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,113
It's been a while. You get me?


744
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,792
It has!

745
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,714
Why you let it get so far, then?
It's been time for me as well, innit?

746
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,631
It's weird.

747
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,719
When I was, like, 15,
all I wanted to do was get older.

748
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,277
And now I am.
I can do anything I want.

749
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,510
I can drink...

750
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,909
vote...

751
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,673
fuck... drive...

752
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,989
I'm legally an adult.

753
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,711
But I've realised two things.

754
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,711
One...

755
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,151
I would do anything
to go get them years back.

756
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,951
Two...

757
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,029
I never felt more alone.

758
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,429
I've never felt more like a kid
in my whole life.

759
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,190
D'you get me?

760
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,555
Yeah.

761
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,031
How you let her chat to me like that, man?
What? Are you some kind of pussy?

762
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,712
- The only pussy is you.
- Fucking...

763
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,678
- Relax, Jay, man.
- I'll take you on, bruv.

764
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,110
Listen, Jay, I don't think
this is a good idea, you know.

765
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,997
Come on, blood.

766
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,868
Have you forgotten what my man did?
What he took from us, blood?

767
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,555
He killed Trife! He took everything!

768
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,593
- What happened to your arm?
- Nothing.

769
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,310
- Why you fight them girls earlier?
- It was something about one of their men.

770
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,870
It was nothing to do with me,
it was to do with Becky, but...

771
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,114
when you hang around with a girl
that's notorious for fucking everyone...

772
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,113
That's why you're here, innit?

773
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,317
Cos you thought,
"I'm gonna fuck the white girl."

774
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,516
"And she'll be easy too,
like her cousin."

775
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,957
He made our lives hell, blood!
For fucking years!

776
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,749
Then he came to that party, blood,
with a bat, and he killed our boy!

777
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,230
If you'd have jumped in,
it wouldn't have happened, would it?

778
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,151
So you have to help me!

779
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,791
And yeah, you know what, I had a few
when I was younger, but so what?

780
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:03,079
Trouble is, once everyone's fucked you,
your bargaining tools is used up.

781
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,196
You ain't got nothing left to offer.

782
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,840
Cos if you'd done something
when you had the chance,

783
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,037
Trife would have still been here today!

784
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,714
- Come we kick, fam.
- Robert!

785
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,155
Yeah, come we go, blood.

786
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,113
You know what?
I ain't got nothing.

787
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,360
I got no man.

788
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,274
No mates.
I got no loyalties to no one.

789
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,476
No one's got none for me.

790
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,235
- Lock that girl off, man!
- D'you know where he is, fam?

791
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,959
Yeah. I know exactly where he is.

792
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,113
So what happened to you?

793
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,034
What? Why does something
have to have happened?

794
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:52,549
It takes something fucked-up to happen to
us for us to realise how big we fucked up.

795
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,551
All right.

796
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,913
Fine.

797
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,560
You wanna know? Cool.

798
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,235
A year and a half ago.

799
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,794
Seven men.

800
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,791
Three hours.

801
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,436
They took turns.

802
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,351
Three hours.

803
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,837
They fucking put things in me.

804
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,275
They raped me.

805
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,437
And they got away with it.

806
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,229
Cos we'd gone there,
to the gym, after hours,

807
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,788
to meet this instructor and his mate.

808
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,838
She didn't tell me
there was gonna be seven mates.

809
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,913
She went off with her one,
left me with the rest.

810
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,757
My dad had to sit in court and hear all the
shit they managed to dredge up about me.

811
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,270
They had money.

812
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,231
Said I was a fucking whore.

813
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,512
I never sold myself, but cos I was with her,
they never believed me.

814
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,513
We didn't speak after it happened,
lived here for ages just not talking.

815
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,353
When she was here, that is.

816
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,749
I had nowhere else to go.

817
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:23,672
That's why I don't give a fuck
where she is, or if she ever comes back.

818
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,916
No one deserves that.

819
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,839
- Who you keep texting?
- No one.

820
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,151
- Who you fucking texting?
- No one. What the fuck are you doing?

821
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,558
Sorry.

822
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,829
What's all that on your back?

823
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,191
Oh, fuck...

824
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,637
What you want, man?

825
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,516
What do I want?

826
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,674
Do you believe in karma?

827
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:05,749
Hm?

828
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,958
Trife, the yout you killed...
was my nephew.

829
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,712
Aaargh!

830
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,551
Shut up.

831
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,951
Make one more fucking noise and I will
kill you even slower than I planned to.

832
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,873
You pussy!

833
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,914
- Hey!
- Noooo!

834
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,079
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Sorry. Sorry. Fuck.

835
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,070
- Sam, it's locked.
- Open the fucking door.

836
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,833
- Open the fucking door!
- All right. Listen.

837
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,675
I know. You try and block it out and
you can't, so you shut everyone else out.

838
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,355
- Fuck you, man!
- I'll tell you what I get told all the time.

839
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,908
What you just told me. Sam.

840
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,709
Whatever happened to you,
whatever it was, you didn't deserve it.

841
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,758
You did fucking deserve it,
you fucking sket!

842
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,434
Don't you ever
fucking say that about me!

843
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,278
Come we fuck him up, man.

844
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,794
See, I knew you'd be on it, blood.

845
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,714
We're gonna finish this tonight. Show him
he should never've fucked with us.

846
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:21,157
Leave that girl as well. Come roll together
again. Jay and Moony running tings...

847
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,231
- My name's Robert.
- All right.

848
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,834
Robert, then, innit?
Bob and Jay running tings.

849
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,438
Prove to people you ain't a pussy no
more. Show Sam we're better than him.

850
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,389
- I can't do this, blood.
- You're gonna back out of this now?

851
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,472
- Why you a pussy? We gotta show him...
- I am showing him!

852
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,712
By what? By being a pussy and letting him
get away with it? By studying your shit?

853
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,316
Yeah! I'm not doing this. I don't want
nothing to do with this. What'll it prove?

854
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,153
Well, fuck you then, innit.

855
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,753
Fucking prick!

856
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:58,799
That's what it's about now, yeah? You're
gonna forget about a man over a girl.

857
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,393
You fucking pussy.

858
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,029
That's what you are, what you've
always been. A fucking pussyhole.

859
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,590
What? You think you're
a big man now? What?

860
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,274
Maybe I'm the smart one, yeah?

861
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,199
He killed Trife, blood!

862
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,193
Hey, you, man.

863
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,918
That's him.

864
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,392
That's him. Come.

865
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,199
Do this shit!

866
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,875
- Turn him over.
- What the fuck for, man? He hurt Henry.

867
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,916
Give me the fucking blade.
I'll do it.

868
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,553
Now turn the pussyhole over.
I want him to see me.

869
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,189
- So he knows who he fucked with.
- Shit...

870
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,671
Sam?

871
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,070
- What's going on?
- What you doing?

872
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,913
That's my brother, blood.
You man mad?

873
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,753
Who knew
who we was looking for?

874
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,751
- You knew.
- What you talking about?

875
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,752
You knew. That's why you
didn't want to let me look at him.

876
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,071
I didn't know nothing about this.

877
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,071
All right, look...
Ike and Andre and them man.

878
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:59,631
They had some next bre there, offering
bare Ps, blood. We'll split it, me and you.

879
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,996
- But that's my brother.
- Fuck him! You don't even like him.

880
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,514
You always gunning him,
telling me you hate him.

881
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,795
Fucker's been in jail
since you was ten.

882
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,509
- You didn't even know he came out today.
- It's still my brother, blood.

883
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,559
So what happened to Henry?
Did my brother hurt Henry?

884
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,556
- What can I say, man, he weren't on it.
- You done him.

885
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,517
You fucking pussyhole.

886
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,750
If not for this prick,
I wouldn't have had to.

887
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,308
- You're wrong, Dabs.
- No, you're wrong.

888
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,790
Yous are all fucking wrong.
Wrong in your fucking brains!

889
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,919
- I'm talking about six Gs here.
- Who gave you the money, blood?

890
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,558
Tss!

891
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,393
Sam, shall I bore this bre?
No one's around, man.

892
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,870
Come I just jook him and we dust, man.
Just like he was gonna do to you.

893
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,758
- Don't be silly...
- Shut your fucking mouth.

894
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,912
Shall I do it, blood?
Just tell me, Sam.

895
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,275
Just say the word.

896
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,595
Nah, man.

897
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:34,038
What a punch, blood!
Seriously, man...

898
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,519
Thung!

899
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,791
You all right, bruv?

900
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,789
Yeah, man. Come we kick.

901
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,150
Whoa!

902
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:53,597
Oyster card too, man.
I'll go check your girl tonight, man.

903
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,719
Safe, blood.
You dickhead, man. Fucking dickhead.

904
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,349
- Where is he?
- He's left. He won't be far.

905
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,078
I told you to keep him.

906
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,879
- Have you got the gear?
- Why should I give you anything?

907
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,431
Come on, Jay. Please. Come on. You
took too long. I tried to keep him here.

908
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,637
Jay, please. Please.
Just give me a little bit, all right?

909
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,439
- Remember when we let you stay here...
- Where's he gone?

910
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,354
- He doesn't want any trouble, Jay...
- Where's he gone?!

911
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,556
I don't know.

912
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,431
Come on, Lex.

913
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,430
What've I gotta do
to get information from you, huh?

914
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,152
- Bring my boys round?
- Fuck you.

915
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,874
Take your fucking drugs.

916
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,392
- What the fuck...
- It was me. What the fuck is all this shit?

917
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,790
- You can't tell me nothing.
- I'm not trying to tell you nothing...

918
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,394
You know what,
just give me your heater.

919
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,199
I know you got one.
Just give it to me.

920
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,310
We got to make the best
out of bad situations.

921
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,153
I get treated certain ways
everywhere we go,

922
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,708
even when I'm not doing nothing,
mans watching me.

923
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,951
Judging me.
For something you done.

924
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:38,113
Right, that... that's making the best
of a bad situation.

925
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,918
There's nothing
for man to do round here.

926
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,514
You know what I learnt when I went
big man jail, blood? Fuck all.

927
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,398
I packed them little breakfast trays,
did a bit of laundry.

928
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,074
I never learnt how to not go back in.
You get on that path...

929
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,152
I'm not stupid like you, though, Sam!

930
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,915
- If I do something I'm not getting caught.
- It's not about getting caught.

931
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,994
It's about spending your days looking over
your shoulder. I don't want that for you.

932
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,916
- Where's this Ike bre's place?
- 40 Compromise Avenue.

933
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,230
It's a basement flat, innit.

934
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,799
- I'm coming.
- Stay here.

935
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,440
- I'm coming...
- I said stay here!

936
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,795
I want you to stay here.

937
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,916
Look, man.
Just do me one favour.

938
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,590
Stay here and look after Mum. The bre
that's after me I think might come here.

939
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:36,470
If you love her, if you ever loved me,
just stay here tonight.

940
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,391
OK?

941
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,038
OK.

942
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,270
You fuck with them, they'll kill you.

943
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,954
Badder men than them have tried.

944
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,637
I love you, Mum.

945
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,150
Royston does too.

946
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,633
- Take your hands out your pockets.
- What the fuck you want?

947
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,280
- Just do what I asked you, please, sir.
- Sam?

948
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,476
- It's Desmond.
- Buds?

949
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,551
- Buds?
- It's what they used to call me.

950
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,996
It's all right. I know him.
Have a little walk, let me chat to him.

951
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,798
Yeah, walk on, man.

952
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,590
What's going on, blood?
When you come out?

953
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,319
Come out today, blood.

954
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,833
Policeman?

955
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,639
Community support, bruv.
I can't arrest no one.

956
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,870
I'm on 22 grand, bruv.

957
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,789
Look, I'm... I'm sorry I never come check
you inside, man. You know what it's like.

958
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,199
Yeah.

959
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,429
Listen, man, I... I better dust
before my man gets annoyed, yeah?

960
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,229
Listen, man, how long armed-response
unit take to come round here?

961
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:58,869
There was a shooting here yesterday,
so there's a couple of cars around.

962
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,474
- Say about 15 minutes.
- Safe, man.

963
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,473
- Why? What's going on?
- Nothing, man. I'm just curious.

964
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,956
You sure?

965
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,234
Yeah.

966
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,356
Stay out of trouble, blood.

967
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,429
It's OK.

968
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,398
Desmond, or Buds,
or whatever you wanna call yourself,

969
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,358
I'm not gonna be made to look a fool
in front of these people.

970
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,595
Yeah.

971
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,238
Hello, Big?

972
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,390
It's Sam. I wanna ask you
for that favour.

973
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,428
No, I ain't got it, but...
it won't take me long to get it.

974
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,238
Filo.

975
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,309
Yep.

976
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,391
How you gonna get him there?

977
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,233
I know how to get him there.

978
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,108
All right, man, it's... your funeral.

979
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,589
15 minutes.

980
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,036
I've got a proposition for you.
Call it a peace offering.

981
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,352
But if I give this to you...
me and you, our problems are done.

982
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,795
<i>When you get there, ask for Big Man.</i>

983
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,715
Give me your bag! Give me the bag, man.
I'm sorry. Just give me the bag.

984
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,356
Hello, police? I've just been robbed
by a man with a gun.

985
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:45,230
He's going into number 40, Compromise
Avenue. I need help right now.

986
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,274
You're not one of our regular boys.

987
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,635
You must be the geezer
Omen said was coming.

988
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,836
Yeah, yeah.
My name's Big Man.

989
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,115
I'm here to check Ike and Andre.

990
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,111
About what?

991
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,518
Nice.

992
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,556
OK.

993
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,474
- Get the fuck over here!
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

994
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,036
You got the time, blood?

995
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,749
You in a rush, blood?

996
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,354
Nah, man. I'm just asking.

997
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,351
All right, come.

998
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,271
Wait there, yeah?

999
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,149
What you saying, blood?

1000
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,154
- So you're Big Man, yeah?
- Yeah, man.

1001
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,749
So what you want from us?

1002
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,512
Talk then, man.

1003
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,477
Me and my business partner
heard of you.

1004
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,916
We thought it might be beneficial
for all of us if we come work with you.

1005
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,197
- So where's your partner?
- He's coming.

1006
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,912
Why do you keep looking at the clock,
blood? There somewhere you need to be?

1007
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,036
- Nah, I'm just...
- Come on, then. Tell us.

1008
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,669
Yeah. You tell us what you can do for us
that we can't do for ourselves.

1009
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,671
Didn't Omen and Dabs tell you?
You need to speak to them...

1010
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,311
Really? And honestly,
I don't never see us working together.

1011
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,475
Think I'd have a fucking monkey like you
on my level?

1012
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:57,356
Don't look to me for support,
you know, blood. His sister's my girl.

1013
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,917
And you know what? I don't really
work with man like you, you know.

1014
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,914
See what Dabs has to say about this.

1015
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,435
- Who are you?
- Where's Big Man?

1016
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,112
Nah. It's answering machine.
Listen, I don't give a fuck...

1017
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,748
What the fuck do you want, man?
I haven't done...

1018
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,718
Shut your fucking mouth.
Put your hands on the table.

1019
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,190
Put your hands on the table.

1020
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:48,876
Now, you're gonna keep quiet.
And you're gonna stay in here.

1021
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,829
Or man is gonna go on different with you,
you understand me, blood?

1022
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,793
Fuck!

1023
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,550
What the fuck is going on?!

1024
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:22,349
Back up! You stay there.
You stay on the fucking floor!

1025
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,670
- You set me up.
- I didn't, Curtis, I swear.

1026
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,558
What the fuck is going?
All of you, shut the fuck up.

1027
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,596
- You!
- Nah, man.

1028
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:32,069
You. You.

1029
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,953
Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose.

1030
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,029
And you two, you were gonna send
my own brother to come try kill me?

1031
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,439
Are you dizzy, blood?

1032
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,473
- All of you is fucking dead, man.
- Yeah?

1033
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,075
Blood, can dead men do this?

1034
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,634
Open it! Police!

1035
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,153
Fuck!

1036
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,312
Down! Get down!

1037
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,157
Fuck.

1038
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:33,358
Hi. Sam... Um, you said
you had your mum's phone.

1039
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,268
Take him.

1040
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,271
I got problems.

1041
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,677
But I'm sorting 'em.

1042
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,949
Open this!

1043
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,952
Listen, Jay's after you,
so just be careful.

1044
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,955
Um...

1045
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,998
I know you said you missed,
like, going cinema and that,

1046
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,719
so I've booked a couple of tickets.

1047
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,554
Thought we could just go tomorrow night,
just as mates?

1048
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,355
Please.

1049
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,716
Call me when you get this.
If you want.

1050
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,195
Out! Police!

1051
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,077
Police! Get down!

1052
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,990
You think I forgot you, blood?
Is that what you think?

1053
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,274
We don't need to do this, Jay.

1054
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,471
I'll kill you, blood.

1055
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,551
I'm gonna kill you, blood!

1056
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,678
You think that's
faster than this, blood?

1057
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:30,349
- Trife wouldn't want this. That's what he...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

1058
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,908
Remember that night, blood?

1059
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,910
- Yeah.
- And what? You think you're a big man?

1060
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,753
No, man. Look, I...
I never wanted him to die, blood.

1061
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,637
What?

1062
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,473
You think this is just about him?

1063
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,913
This is about me!

1064
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,151
Why you think I'm here, huh?
Like this?

1065
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,913
You did this.
You made this happen.

1066
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,480
I fucking hate you for it.

1067
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,120
I'm here not just for you,

1068
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,191
I'm here because of you!

1069
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,271
- Then I beg you, let's stop.
- That's right, blood, beg!

1070
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,193
I wanna hear you.
I wanna hear you beg like Trife did.

1071
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:16,831
If that's what you want, blood.
I'm begging, man, don't do this. Please.

1072
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,876
I'm still gonna kill you, blood.

1073
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,078
I'm gonna take your fucking life,
like you took Trife's.

1074
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,957
Like you took mine!

1075
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,557
Just fucking do it, man,
and get it over with.

1076
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,549
Six and a half years
and that's what you still want.

1077
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:36,996
You think you're a bad man, Jay?

1078
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,675
I thought I was a fucking bad man,
remember that?

1079
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:44,799
I thought I was fucking bad,
and they put me in a big-man jail,

1080
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,757
and look what happened to me.

1081
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,512
You see this?

1082
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,390
This is from where I tried to kill myself
because I couldn't cope in there.

1083
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,278
You see these?
Look at them. Look at them!

1084
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:03,514
I cut my arms so I wouldn't give them the
satisfaction of dealing out the most pain.

1085
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,673
You know why they did it to me? Because
I thought I was fucking bad, and I wasn't.

1086
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,189
Now you wanna be bad. You think
you're big, Jay. You wanna be a big man.

1087
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,829
You wanna be what I thought I was.
You wanna be me!

1088
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,348
Then you fucking do it, blood.

1089
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,874
You see what happens to you.

1090
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,278
Is this what you want?

1091
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:03,359
- See, you're just like me, man.
- No, I'm nothing like you.

1092
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,955
You ain't a killer, blood.
You're like me.

1093
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,675
You're nothing.

1094
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,480
I never meant to kill Trife, blood.

1095
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,196
And I'm so sorry.

1096
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,272
This ain't over, blood.

1097
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:38,319
You really think this is over, blood?
This ain't fucking over, blood!

1098
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,949
Where the fuck you going, blood?
You ain't got nowhere to go.

1099
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,793
You ain't got no friends.
You ain't got no one.

1100
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,070
This ain't over!

1101
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:58,191
Yeah, it is.

1102
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:32,791
<i>Thought we could just go</i>
<i>tomorrow night, just as mates? Please.</i>

1103
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,007
<i>Call me when
you get this.</i>

1104
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:05,711
