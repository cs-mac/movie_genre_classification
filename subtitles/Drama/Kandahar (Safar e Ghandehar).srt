1
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,204
KAN DAHAR

2
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,867
Mohsen MAKH MALBAF

3
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,378
What is your name?

4
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:16,486
Nafas.

5
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,883
Who are you?

6
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,450
The bride's cousin.

7
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,918
Miss Nafas,
you have made up your mind

8
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,113
to go to Afghanistan

9
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,222
I will find you a family
who can be trusted

10
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,692
to go with you

11
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,291
If anyone questions you,
say that you are

12
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,803
a member of the family,

13
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,431
the wife, or the daughter,

14
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,407
so that no one suspects you

15
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,720
Pay attention, girls...

16
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,652
Today is your last day at school

17
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,818
In Afghanistan,
you will not be going to school

18
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,330
There are no schools there

19
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,460
You will have to stay at home

20
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,632
But you mustn't give up hope

21
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:31,140
If walls are high,
the sky is higher still

22
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:36,775
One day, the world will see
your troubles and come to your aid

23
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,874
If it doesn't,

24
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,588
you will have to stand together

25
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,554
Close your eyes.
Imagine that you are an ant

26
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,426
If you pretend to be an ant

27
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,362
you can close your eyes

28
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,400
and the house
will appear much bigger

29
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,797
Thank you!

30
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,727
Let's try something

31
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,833
I throw one of them,
and I step on it

32
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,197
If there's a noise, I'm dead

33
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,906
I close my eyes
and throw the others

34
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:45,836
One, two, three...
Bravo!

35
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,109
Back a bit

36
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,444
Watch my hand

37
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,309
Don't move

38
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,464
Don't move. Watch my hand

39
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,462
Look at me

40
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,429
You see that black head over there?

41
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:48,833
Yes

42
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,539
For one hundred dollars,

43
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,205
will you make sure she gets
to Kandahar safe and sound?

44
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:02,546
If anyone stops you on the way,

45
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,279
you must say

46
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,984
that she is your fourth wife

47
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,130
Why should I say that?
I have two Hazaras wives,

48
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:18,563
and one Pachtoune
My Ouzbeck wife is dead

49
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,637
With a Tadjik wife, I will have
married all Afghanistan!

50
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,740
I'm going to take a photo

51
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,006
Don't move. Look at the camera

52
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,311
Put this UNO flag on your car,

53
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,385
it will protect you

54
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,814
Take these dollars

55
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,255
for the journey to Afghanistan

56
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,655
Your photo is in the file

57
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,924
Don't come back for more dollars

58
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,534
Do you understand?

59
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,999
Madam...

60
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,162
The latest news of the eclipse:

61
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:04,171
The final eclipse of the twentieth
Century will take place in two days

62
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,775
It will cross Western Iran,
Afghanistan

63
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,949
and finish
in the Indian subcontinent

64
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,154
It's getting late.
Why aren't we going?

65
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,394
Don't you want to eat?

66
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,691
What for? I'm late!

67
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:30,425
Lower your burga first

68
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,103
It is a matter of honor.
We are devout people

69
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,501
No man must see my wife's face

70
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,200
People will ridicule you

71
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,374
if your burga is not worn properly

72
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,742
A burga is not for show

73
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:49,580
It is a veil, to cover you

74
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,187
To cover you up!

75
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,646
All right, I'll do it,

76
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,520
but I am not really your wife

77
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,753
That is true, you are not,

78
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,694
but what will that matter
to scandalmongers?

79
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,529
They will say: "His wife
is improperly dressed"

80
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,472
The burga is not an ornament

81
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,801
My honor is at stake.

82
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,410
Are we going?

83
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,672
I'll call the driver. He's eating

84
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,051
We'll go when he's finished

85
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,016
Tell the women to hurry up

86
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,796
Quickly, it's time to go

87
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,231
Why are you hurrying us, sister.

88
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,344
We'll be going to Kandahar
soon enough

89
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,740
I have to be there by tomorrow

90
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,644
Let the girls do their nails

91
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,526
What do you want?

92
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,598
Let go! Let go!

93
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,233
Don't fear! Praise be to God!

94
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,601
Heavens, we thank you!

95
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,742
God is generous. He is great

96
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,539
May he grant you good health!

97
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,808
Thanks be to You for all things!

98
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,858
We have nothing!

99
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,460
God is great and merciful

100
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,294
May he grant you good health!

101
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,900
Thank you, my God!

102
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,068
Silence!

103
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,238
Silence!

104
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,644
What is a sabre?

105
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,417
A weapon which executes
God's orders

106
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,412
It severs the thief's hand
and the murderers head

107
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,954
Continue!

108
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,587
Silence!

109
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,925
What is a Kalashnikov?

110
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,599
A semi-automatic weapon

111
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,134
with gunpowder and repeat

112
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,899
It kills the living and destroys those
already dead

113
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,669
You are wrong. Start again

114
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,910
A semi-automatic weapon

115
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,016
with gunpowder and repeat action

116
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,981
It kills the living,

117
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,587
destroys their flesh,

118
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:09,351
and mutilates the bodies
of those already dead

119
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,887
Continue!

120
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,434
Silence!

121
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,635
- You are not moving?
- My back hurts

122
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,703
Recite the Koran

123
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,378
No. You, go on

124
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,423
Recite it like him

125
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,493
You do not know it

126
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,320
How can that be?

127
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,999
Learn it. You don't know it

128
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,933
You are just copying the rhythm

129
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,316
No, not like that

130
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,927
Like that

131
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,329
No, that's not right.
You haven't learnt it. Why?

132
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,832
Recite it properly,

133
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,743
or I will expel you

134
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,314
Your mind is elsewhere

135
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,555
No, not like that.
Go and fetch your mother

136
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,355
Continue!

137
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,508
- Mullah!
- Yes

138
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,244
Greetings

139
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,287
- Are you well?
- Yes, thank you

140
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,083
I am Khak's mother

141
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,751
Why have you expelled him?

142
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:30,058
If he'd learned his lessons,
I wouldn't have expelled him

143
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,361
Help him to learn, Mullah!

144
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,262
Mullah! He works hard!

145
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,199
Don't expel him!

146
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,604
I have suspended him many times

147
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,712
He learns nothing at school.
He will never be a Mullah

148
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:49,148
Send him to work in Iran

149
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,652
Finish eating
and wash before praying

150
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:58,560
Khak!

151
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,857
You do not work hard enough
to become a Mullah

152
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,025
Go and change

153
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:12,105
Eat properly,
finish the meal correctly

154
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,876
May God bless the Mullah!
He has taken my son

155
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:24,846
Why?
He has expelled mine!

156
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,024
My son has no father.
He was killed by a mine

157
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,387
We are alone,
we have nothing to eat.

158
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,621
My son has nothing to eat either

159
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,459
He has to study. He is too young

160
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,692
He is not old enough to work

161
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,265
You accepted two hundred dollars
to take me

162
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,376
and you're leaving me here?

163
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,876
You saw yourself,
they took everything

164
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,414
We must return to Iran

165
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,083
I have to get
to my sister in Kandahar

166
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,689
I have to go back to Iran.
In Afghanistan, nothing is safe.

167
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,881
Shall I recite the Koran
for your dead?

168
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,058
We are the dead.
Sing for us

169
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,027
What am I going to do?

170
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,229
Come back to Iran with us

171
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:21,997
Have I come this far
just to turn back?

172
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,606
Afghanistan is our homeland.
We long to return there

173
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,007
But there is nothing there
but famine, suffering and massacre

174
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,240
I must take my family back to Iran

175
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,075
And me, what should I do?

176
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,617
You could return with us to Iran

177
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:42,282
If not, go to Kandahar by cart

178
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,525
Shall I recite the Koran
for your dead?

179
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:49,661
Forgive us. Your journey is
more perilous than ours

180
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:54,299
The UNO flag will protect you

181
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,097
Take it, little one.

182
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,208
If you see any dolls,
don't touch them

183
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,176
Shall I recite the Koran?

184
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,247
Will you take me to Kandahar?

185
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,917
No. It is too dangerous.

186
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:11,849
Walk half a day, then go on by cart

187
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,450
- Where are you going?
- To Kandahar

188
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,685
- How much for taking you there?
- Is it far?

189
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,060
- Three days' journey
- I only have two days

190
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,665
Three days if you go slowly,
two days if you hurry

191
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,634
One day if you run

192
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,295
I'll run

193
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,100
How much will you pay me?

194
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,741
- How much do you want?
- Fifty thousand Afghani

195
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,675
I don't have Afghan money
How much in dollars?

196
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,314
Fifty thousand dollars

197
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,213
What are you talking about?

198
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,684
Fifty thousand Afghani
makes one dollar.

199
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,255
One dollar is nothing.
I want fifty thousand dollars

200
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,892
I'll give you fifty dollars.
All right?

201
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,153
Lift your burga, so I can see you

202
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,830
Why do you want to see me?

203
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,762
To make sure it's not a trick

204
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,131
Look at me

205
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,531
- And you, can I trust you?
- It's OK

206
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,667
Let's go

207
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,553
- What's your name?
- Khak

208
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,595
How do you earn a living?

209
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,359
And you, what do you do?

210
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:35,868
l am a student.
I get paid to study

211
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,501
I earn my living with my voice

212
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,009
What do you mean?

213
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,416
Give me a dollar and I'll show you

214
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,548
I've given you fifty dollars!

215
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,188
That's for being your guide

216
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:56,156
Take it.
Another dollar to hear you sing

217
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,557
OK, I'll sing

218
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,862
- Don't look at me
- Why?

219
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,695
I'm shy.
I'll sing if you walk in front.

220
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,837
Okay

221
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,335
Don't look at me

222
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,172
- Why not?
- I'm shy

223
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,725
There are two paths

224
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,920
We have to take the long one

225
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,828
I don't have time.
Let's go the short way

226
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,097
Don't be afraid

227
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,603
I'm going the long way

228
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,938
I want to find things to sell
so I can give my mother money

229
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,043
Khak! Khak!

230
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,719
Where are you?

231
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,733
I've found a beautiful ring!

232
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,940
A beautiful ring!

233
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,574
I'll sell it for five dollars!

234
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,678
Look how beautiful it is!

235
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:46,124
You want to buy it?

236
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,891
It matches your eyes!

237
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,599
It matches your eyes!

238
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,663
Only five dollars!

239
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,673
It's beautiful!
You want to buy it?

240
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:00,894
What is your name?

241
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,891
Nafasgul.

242
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,960
Who is sick?

243
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,232
My mother

244
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,333
What's wrong with her?

245
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,008
Stomach ache

246
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,945
Does she throw up her food?

247
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,946
Do you throw up your food?

248
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,684
No.

249
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,885
- Does she go to the toilet a lot?
- Do you go to the toilet a lot?

250
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:30,991
No.

251
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:38,029
- What has she eaten this morning?
- What have you eaten this morning?

252
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,501
She has a stomach ache

253
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,502
Did she eat a heavy meal
last night?

254
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:51,013
- Was your dinner heavy last night?
- I didn't eat anything

255
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,375
She was sick,
she didn't eat anything

256
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,014
Was she sick yesterday afternoon?

257
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,523
- Were you sick yesterday?
- Yes

258
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,287
Has she eaten any spoiled meat?

259
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,591
Have you eaten any spoiled meat?

260
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,666
I was sick yesterday.
I didn't eat anything

261
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:17,637
She was sick,
she didn't eat anything.

262
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:19,867
And yesterday morning?

263
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,936
I was sick, I didn't eat a thing

264
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,309
She was sick,
she didn't eat a thing

265
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,417
Tell her to move closer

266
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,084
Open your mouth

267
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,621
Tell her to say "ah"

268
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,897
Cough

269
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,534
Tell her to cough

270
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,940
Tell her to put her eye to the hole

271
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,347
Put your eye to the hole

272
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,400
She is anaemic

273
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,367
- Do you have stomach ache too?
- Yes

274
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,370
Since yesterday?

275
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,773
For three days

276
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,781
Here, take this bread

277
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:41,055
Eat some three times a day.
Morning, midday and evening

278
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,644
'Surgery'

279
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,244
- Who is sick?
- My sister

280
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,888
What's wrong with her?

281
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,253
It's her stomach

282
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:20,052
She throws up everything she eats

283
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,425
and keeps going to the toilet

284
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,860
- What has she eaten?
- Water and bread

285
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,598
What water?

286
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,237
From the wells

287
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,603
Tell her to drink this

288
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,416
She has a fever

289
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,350
Tell her to move closer

290
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,255
The doctor wants to examine you

291
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,789
Move closer to the hole

292
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,416
It's the dirty water, I'm certain

293
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,456
Tell her to move her ear closer

294
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,080
Tell her to move her mouth closer

295
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,540
These are for you

296
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,347
Nuts. Eat them

297
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,990
Tell her to breathe deeply

298
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,440
Breathe... like that...

299
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,922
She is very sick.
Tell her to move closer

300
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:11,522
You are very sick.
Move your ear closer

301
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,643
Tell her to breathe deeply

302
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:36,484
Breathe... deeply

303
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,975
Hello, doctor

304
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,615
- Will you buy my chickens?
- If they're healthy

305
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,058
Khak, come here

306
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:13,795
What do you want?

307
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,362
I have given you fifty dollars

308
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:21,332
Take another fifty

309
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,666
and go home. I'll go on alone

310
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,942
You won't make it

311
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,548
There are mines and bandits

312
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,446
You're too slow. I'm in a hurry

313
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,110
It's you who's slow. You're sick.
I'll go quicker

314
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:45,518
I am sick, I'm worn out

315
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,627
Go back home

316
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,065
Give me a dollar for the ring

317
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:57,796
No, you took it from the hand
of a corpse

318
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:02,205
It's clean!
The body was clean! Buy it!

319
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,716
- I don't want it.
- It's beautiful. Only one dollar

320
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,715
Put it away, I don't want it

321
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,217
Only one dollar

322
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,981
No. Go home

323
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,423
It matches your eyes

324
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,125
Buy it, it's a bargain

325
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,494
I don't want it

326
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,965
Goodbye, then. I'm going

327
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,934
These chickens are diseased.
Don't sell them. Don't eat them.

328
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:41,207
Here, go and buy some bread

329
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,858
- Will you buy the ring?
- I already told you, no

330
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,755
It's beautiful, like your eyes.
I'll give it to you

331
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,160
I don't want it

332
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,266
Why?

333
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,994
Because it came from a dead body

334
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:47,039
The skeleton was clean.
Here, I'm giving it to you

335
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:51,112
I don't want it.
You took it from a corpse

336
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:56,217
It was clean.
Take it, I'm giving it to you

337
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,977
No

338
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,319
Take it

339
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,389
If you don't want it,

340
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,253
take it for your sister

341
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,296
- I don't want it
- Why not? For your sister!

342
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,892
Give it to me and go home

343
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,702
I beg you,

344
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,137
take me to the Red Cross

345
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,328
Take me to the Red Cross

346
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,966
Get in, we can talk

347
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,770
- Where are you going?
- To the Red Cross

348
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,280
My wife's legs were blown off
by a mine

349
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,973
They gave her a temporary set,
for a year

350
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,884
She can't walk with them

351
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:30,257
Today, I have to change them
for a new pair

352
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,289
What misery!

353
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:36,255
- What's your name?
- Hamdallah

354
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:41,299
- You're a soldier?
- No, a farmer

355
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:43,971
I stepped on a mine

356
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,769
- Does it hurt'?
- Very badly

357
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,445
- Do you sleep well?
- No

358
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,610
We'll give you drugs

359
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,379
You'll have to wait

360
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,316
I've lost my hand.
Give me a new hand

361
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,058
Do you walk on your hands?

362
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,255
No, I was going to Kandahar

363
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,095
The ground was full of mines.
I wasn't thinking

364
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,431
I touched a mine with my hand

365
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,776
I have no family left.
I had four brothers

366
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:25,037
All blown up by mines,
except me

367
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,010
I'm homeless and penniless

368
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:30,981
I lost my leg.
Here, they've given me

369
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:34,645
two boxes of penicillin,
but no leg

370
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,587
They lie to us
Always promises

371
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:42,197
They' don't have
enough drugs or legs

372
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:46,562
I can't get to sleep

373
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:54,107
I've lost my hand.
Please, give me a new hand

374
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,807
We only have legs here

375
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,574
Then give me some legs

376
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,580
What use would they be?
You already have legs

377
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,586
We are crossing the desert

378
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:12,591
There are mines everywhere.
It would be good to have some

379
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,924
What happened to you?

380
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,964
I set off a mine
on my way to work

381
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:23,400
I'm in agony

382
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,403
- Your name?
- Ebrahim

383
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,304
- What do you do?
- I'm a labourer

384
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,775
- How old are you?
- Twenty

385
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,611
You'll have to wait

386
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,074
You're here every day

387
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,689
No, only today.
Give me a leg

388
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:46,653
Are you blind? They don't have any.
You have two.

389
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,123
We don't make hands here

390
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,960
A mine took my leg,
while I was working

391
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,261
Don't touch it! It hurts

392
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:57,268
I haven't shut my eyes
in four months

393
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,703
I haven't come for myself

394
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,535
I can't come every day

395
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:08,411
At least give me one for my friend.
He has no one

396
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,109
His parents are martyrs of the war

397
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,811
I pity him

398
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,918
I lost my legs in my own field

399
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,459
I'm not getting better.
No one cares for us here

400
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:24,895
If you don't have drugs,
you can't sleep

401
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,835
My friend has no one

402
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,437
I'll take the legs for him

403
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,404
I swear to you

404
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,839
- I don't believe you
- I'm not lying!

405
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,905
If you won't give me any for him

406
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,149
give me some for my mother

407
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:47,081
She lost both legs
I was taking her to the hospital

408
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,017
leading her by the arm

409
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,854
She fell to the ground

410
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:56,429
I stood on a mine,
and lost my leg

411
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,588
Try to walk with that

412
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,598
It's agony, even with crutches

413
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,699
- And at night?
- Night and day

414
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:05,999
You have to wait

415
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,574
We have ordered them

416
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:11,611
Doctor, give me some legs
for my mother

417
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:16,742
She'll have to come herself

418
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:21,014
She has no legs,
she can't come

419
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,921
I don't believe you.
Every day it's a new story

420
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,152
I don't come every day

421
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,160
Today is my first time

422
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,924
Give me some legs for her

423
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,629
Follow me

424
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,252
I'll give you a temporary pair

425
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,283
on the condition
you don't come back

426
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,923
Do you promise?

427
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,684
Take them

428
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:03,397
These are no good!
You can't walk on these!

429
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:07,126
Give me a decent pair

430
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:11,170
Those are the best I have.
I don't have any others

431
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,639
No one could walk with those.
I want a proper pair

432
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,208
They are for someone else

433
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,644
He's been waiting a year

434
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,445
Give me some proper legs,

435
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,052
I beg you

436
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:29,417
No. Go on. Now

437
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,927
No. Go on, go!

438
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,072
Does it hurt a lot?

439
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,752
Yes, very badly

440
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,150
Now, or mainly at night?

441
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,691
Day and night

442
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,321
Here, these are for your wife

443
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,462
You must tell her,

444
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:52,930
if they break,
she will have to wait another year

445
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,448
They are enormous!

446
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,885
They're not right for her

447
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,647
They are her size

448
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:20,191
These are for a man

449
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,557
They have to be sturdy

450
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,995
Your wife has to
be able to walk on them

451
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:28,102
She has to be comfortable on them

452
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,775
Was she comfortable
with the temporary ones?

453
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:53,893
Miss!

454
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,964
They're to big.
They're not her size!

455
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,130
My wife has slender legs

456
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:03,463
- They aren't meant to be elegant
- They're heavy

457
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,505
They have to be sturdy
so she can walk on them

458
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,711
People have to wait a year
to get them,

459
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,403
and you don't want them?

460
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,606
These are for a man,
not a woman!

461
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,417
They are to allow her to walk,

462
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,645
not to make her look pretty

463
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:23,620
Those legs are for a man,
not a woman

464
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,282
What are you doing?

465
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:28,759
I'll take these,
they're her size.

466
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:33,159
What are you doing?
They are for someone else!

467
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,929
A woman is coming for them

468
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,767
She has waited a year,

469
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,636
just like your wife

470
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:47,708
My wife can't walk
with a man's legs

471
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,544
What's important is that
she can walk at all

472
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,416
Look, miss.
These are her size

473
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:01,586
The others won't do.
They're too big

474
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,370
Look, these are the shoes
she got married in

475
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,346
They fit these feet,
they're the right size

476
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,886
Magda!

477
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,122
Yes

478
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,402
Excuse me,
are you going to Kandahar?

479
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,271
No, I've no reason to go there

480
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:24,276
Look at these shoes.
They fit on the feet.

481
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:28,975
I'll take these

482
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:32,085
I won't take the others

483
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:37,482
My wife wouldn't have them.
She cries all the time...

484
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,207
Will you buy these legs?

485
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,037
Get in, we'll talk

486
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,988
You want to buy them?

487
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,460
I still have my own, thank God

488
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,962
It's good to have replacements

489
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,566
They belonged to my mother

490
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:45,263
She has never used them.
They're like new

491
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:49,172
These fields are full of mines,
you should have a spare pair

492
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:54,178
You have to wait a year for them
with the Red Cross

493
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,442
I'll let you have them
for next-to-nothing

494
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,812
- Are you going to Kandahar?
- No

495
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,684
The legs, whose are they?

496
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,727
My mother's. God bless her soul

497
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:14,301
She was old, bedridden

498
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,371
She never used them

499
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:21,803
The pennies you give me

500
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:23,409
will help me bury her

501
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,307
Will you take me to Kandahar?

502
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,411
No, I can't

503
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,021
Why not?

504
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,492
There's a problem.
Go with this gentleman

505
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,326
l am a woman on her own

506
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:48,127
I can't hurt you

507
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,826
Take me to Kandahar

508
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:54,304
If I go there, people will ask
where I lost my hand

509
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:58,172
If I tell them "At work"
they won't believe me

510
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,712
They'll turn me
in to the Moudjahedin

511
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:03,146
They will say:
"What about your head?"

512
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,148
Why won't you help her?

513
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,753
And you?

514
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:08,889
I'll give you four laks

515
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:12,083
to take this woman to Kandahar

516
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:16,025
I can't go there

517
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,664
Buy them for the journey

518
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,331
There's a problem.
He can't go with me

519
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,265
You're a coward!

520
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:26,036
I'm not. Why don't you go?

521
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,334
What if I give you
a hundred dollars?

522
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:31,171
A hundred dollars isn't enough
to go there

523
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,940
- You're a coward!
- I'm not

524
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:38,013
- A hundred dollars is nothing.
- A hundred and fifty?

525
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,983
I won't go there,
even for a hundred and fifty

526
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,486
I'll give you two hundred

527
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,390
- How much?
- Two hundred

528
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,753
Two hundred dollars?

529
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:50,321
I have to think.
I'm going to get my things

530
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:54,926
I'll be right back to take you

531
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:58,601
Give me four laks for the legs,

532
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:02,571
then I'll come back
and take you to Kandahar

533
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,779
If I don't pay you,
you'll come back quicker

534
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:11,309
Give me the money.
You're trying to trick me

535
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:12,316
Pay me

536
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:17,582
I'll make sure the road is safe,
then I'll take you

537
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:31,362
- Give me four laks.
- When you get back

538
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,801
Give me four laks

539
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,009
Wait here for me

540
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,572
I'm": waiting. Hurry up

541
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:58,969
Don't be scared, it's me

542
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:04,406
Where have you been?

543
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:07,844
They're going
to a wedding in Kandahar

544
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,313
Hurry up, time's running out

545
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:12,679
Come on, we'll go with them

546
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:18,083
Take the four laks.
Let's go!

547
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,749
I'm keeping the legs

548
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:23,328
Something to remember my mother by

549
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:28,931
Goodbye

550
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:04,291
If I speak, they will know
that I'm a man

551
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:08,595
Go and tell them
we are cousins of the groom

552
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:11,567
Ask the bride's name,
in case we meet a patrol

553
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:14,032
I'll find Out

554
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:21,538
I am the groom's cousin.
What is the bride's name?

555
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:24,776
l am his cousin.
Who are you?

556
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,921
There's some mistake.
I am the bride's cousin

557
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,487
What is the groom's name?

558
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,988
His name is Mossafer

559
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,264
The groom's name is Mossafer

560
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,628
We are the bride's cousins

561
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:45,038
First, she pretends to be

562
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,663
the groom's cousin,
then the bride's...

563
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:06,090
If they question us,
we'll say we're married

564
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:08,593
What's your name?

565
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:11,355
- Nafas.
- I'm Hayat

566
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:15,868
We'll say we have two children,
a boy and a girl

567
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:46,564
Why are they going that way?

568
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:50,931
Is that the way to Kandahar?

569
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,870
They're going the wrong way

570
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,372
Ask someone else

571
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,489
I'm taking my sons to Iran

572
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:17,195
If you're going to Iran,
come with us

573
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:19,093
No, I'm going to Kandahar

574
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:22,701
Tell them you're the groom's cousin

575
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:18,622
Stop!

576
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,357
Sit!

I'm Hayat

580
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,881
Be quiet! Don't speak!

581
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:53,959
Put your baggage on the ground

582
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:56,026

583
