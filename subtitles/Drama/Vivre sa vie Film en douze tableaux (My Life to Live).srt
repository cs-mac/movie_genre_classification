1
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,765
<i>New York,
February 16, 1959</i>

2
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:16,858
Hurry! She collapsed 10 minutes ago.

3
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,144
The ambulance is on its way.

4
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:24,759
<i>Saint Theresa, dear God,
do not forsake me...</i>

5
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:30,515
<i>...give me strength. I want to live.
Restore me to life.</i>

6
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,732
Paris, Belleville, 1918

7
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,292
Why are you crying?
- Get the hell out of here, scum!

8
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:07,218
<i>I'm so lonely and miserable.
Life is so hard.</i>

9
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:12,307
<i>But it's all I know.
What more can I say?</i>

10
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:15,560
What are you doing here?

11
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:20,231
Why are you crying?
Are you on your own?

12
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,777
Where's your mother?

13
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:30,992
<i>Wherever I go,
in chains,</i>

14
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,123
<i>There is nothing but pain.
Nothing to accomplish.</i>

15
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:44,005
<i>My life is so hard.
I've known nothing else,</i>

16
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:47,842
<i>I'm all alone and miserable.</i>

17
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,887
A fine mother YOU are!
Hanging's too good for you!

18
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:54,933
I have to live too. I'm a singer!
- She should be looking after your daughter!

19
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:57,018
I look after her very well!

20
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:12,575
<i>Louis, I can no longer wait here for you.
Belleville is horrible.</i>

21
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:16,871
<i>My agent says that someone with my talent
should go to Constantinople...</i>

22
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:19,791
<i>...just like Frehel the singer...</i>

23
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,377
Good news for our acrobat?

24
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:26,881
Sure, and Clemenceau sends his regards.

25
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,724
<i>I left Edith with my mother.</i>

26
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:39,269
<i>She'll take care of her
till I'm on my feet again.</i>

27
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:43,315
<i>Louis, I can't wait for you any longer.</i>

28
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,026
<i>Anetta.</i>

29
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,509
Anybody home?

30
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:47,128
Edith?

31
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:56,930
Louis?

32
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,395
I'm taking her with me.

33
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,256
Bernay, Normandy, 1918

34
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,499
And who's this?

35
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:12,047
Your granddaughter: Edith.

36
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:17,135
That's a peculiar name.

37
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,145
She's a sickly looking child.

38
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:31,650
Come with me.

39
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,912
What are you doing here?

40
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:47,374
What a angel!
What's your name?

41
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:52,087
Back to work, Titine!
- There's someone in the toilet upstairs.

42
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,881
What lovely blue eyes you have.

43
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,272
I'm listening...

44
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,193
I have to be getting back.

45
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:21,366
I'll be demobbed soon.
Then I can work as an acrobat again.

46
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:25,120
I'll return for my little angel.
- Not now!

47
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:28,873
I'm finished, Mama Louise.
- Watch the door.

48
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:36,589
Where's her mother?

49
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,634
No idea.

50
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:45,974
Would you want her to stay here?

51
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,439
People will talk.
- People always talk.

52
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:31,853
Isn't she going with us to Mass?

53
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:39,361
We'll be late for Mass.
- The world doesn't revolve around her.

54
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:50,413
It appears we have a baby.
- May we see her?

55
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:54,709
It's a little girl. Would she like some bread?
- All right, everybody leave, please.

56
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:59,589
Come on, ask her if she'll sing for us.

57
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,886
A shame that communists aren't allowed on the stage.

58
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:14,604
<i>One night I went swimming
in my birthday suit,</i>

59
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:19,901
<i>Nobody could see me,
Only the night itself.</i>

60
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:25,740
<i>Until the moon suddenly appeared,
I felt like saying: shine on me.</i>

61
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,702
<i>Then I heard close by</i>

62
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:30,870
<i>A heartfelt cry.</i>

63
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,084
<i>A man stood on a rock,
Low enough to see me.</i>

64
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,378
<i>The man cried "Oh!"</i>

65
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,092
<i>And from the water,
I cried "oh" back.</i>

66
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,762
<i>He saw me naked,</i>

67
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:56,604
<i>Nothing to cover me,
I blushed the whole night long.</i>

68
00:10:56,855 --> 00:11:02,986
<i>He saw me naked,
Completely naked.</i>

69
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:09,242
<i>Out of respect for the poor man,
I covered up my face.</i>

70
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:15,373
<i>But now I know
that by doing so</i>

71
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:22,380
<i>I ended up showing
my charms below.</i>

72
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:27,260
<i>He saw me naked.</i>

73
00:11:47,822 --> 00:11:51,242
Titine! Open the door.
That's enough now.

74
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:54,287
What's the matter?
- She has Edith with her.

75
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,332
Open up I say!
- Whatever is the matter?

76
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:01,252
Nothing. Get a move on.
The customers will be here any minute.

77
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:05,757
Open the door! Otherwise I'll...
- I don't want to work.

78
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:09,594
I don't want to work.
- Oh, you don't want to work?

79
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:15,850
What do you think this is, a hotel?
- Edith is staying here with me tonight.

80
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:17,852
That's what YOU think.

81
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:23,191
It's me. Open this door.
The soldier is here.

82
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:28,071
<i>I couldn't care less.
That liar with his lies and alibis.</i>

83
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:34,119
<i>Stop your nonsense and get yourself out here.
Otherwise it's the street for you.</i>

84
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:36,538
I'm tired of you playing the drama queen!

85
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:49,759
I don't want any nonsense.

86
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:10,405
New York, May 8, 1959

87
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,075
Doug!

88
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,041
What, are you jealous?

89
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,503
I'll send the Billie Holiday records
to the hotel.

90
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:30,425
<i>Thank you, Loulou. Billie and I were born the same year.
Is that not something?</i>

91
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,096
I've brought my drawings.

92
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,184
You want to see them now, or later?

93
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:42,854
Later. First I have to sing that shmuck's song.

94
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:47,525
That's before your time...
- What?

95
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,528
Nothing.

96
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,723
I'm ready.

97
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:20,558
I'm ready.

98
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,391
That's Jeanne!

99
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,813
What's the matter?

100
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:51,733
Blood everywhere...
- Tell me about it!

101
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,779
<i>He wanted to play doctors and patients,
with my instruments.</i>

102
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:57,572
The filthy swine!

103
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:01,076
Titine!

104
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:05,163
We'll have to tell Madame.
- She'll kill me. It hurts!

105
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,377
I can't see anything.

106
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:32,357
Well, doctor?
- It's not good I'm afraid.

107
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:35,610
It's her cornea.

108
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,113
Is she blind?

109
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:40,949
It's an infection.

110
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:44,369
Patience. This sort of thing can last for months.

111
00:16:44,995 --> 00:16:48,123
Take this to the pharmacist.

112
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:50,834
My thanks.

113
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,502
Whose child is she?

114
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,381
Nobody's.

115
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,341
Lisieux, Normandy

116
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:47,974
<i>Theresa, I never ask anything of you.
But I'm asking you to listen to little Edith.</i>

117
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:53,188
Please, Edith.
Say it. She's listening.

118
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:59,027
Theresa, I don't want to be blind.
I want to see.

119
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:01,738
She bumps into everything.
Go on.

120
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:06,951
<i>I want to learn how to read, and to run like I used to.
I don't want to be blind.</i>

121
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,206
Saint Theresa, please ask baby Jesus
to take care of Edith.

122
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:13,708
Go on.

123
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:18,338
Thank you, Saint Theresa, Jesus.
- Thank you.

124
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,257
She can see...

125
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:28,969
She can see!

126
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:40,146
Titine, get up!

127
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:43,858
What is it?
- He's back. He's come for Edith.

128
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,652
Get dressed.

129
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,946
They can't do this to me!

130
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:51,074
How can you keep on doing this?

131
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,159
She'll see a lot of the world.

132
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:54,285
Go!

133
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,747
Edith!

134
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,541
Titine!

135
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,961
Don't take my little girl away.

136
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:05,171
Let her go!

137
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:07,257
Enough!

138
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:09,134
She's crazy!

139
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:10,677
Stop or I'll throw you out!

140
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:13,054
You've no right!

141
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,647
Don't do this to me!
- Go!

142
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:33,491
It's over! I'm ending it all.

143
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,167
Here we are at Orly airport.
The passengers are disembarking...

144
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:47,088
...I see Edith Piaf!
With a young man in tow.

145
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:50,842
What have you brought back from America?
- An American.

146
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:52,802
What's his name?

147
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,305
Edith, for God's sake!

148
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,224
<i>Just as in her song, she's carried
'by the crowd.'.</i>

149
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:02,812
She's stepping into her amazing
black-and-white automobile.

150
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:07,275
She looks exhausted, but she's dazzling all the same.

151
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,451
Quiet, please! I wish to propose a toast ...

152
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,036
You're drunk!

153
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,330
You're one to talk!

154
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,875
Help the invalid.

155
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:29,297
Look out, accordion player, or I'll get you.

156
00:22:31,174 --> 00:22:32,425
Perfect timing.

157
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:36,054
Get the manager.
I demand champagne on the house.

158
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,516
I'm Edith Piaf,
and I've made a mess of things.

159
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,647
<i>Kiss one another! Even those who don't like each other!
Kiss me, Claude.</i>

160
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,989
.

161
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:56,908
Who's that slapper?
- No idea.

162
00:22:57,117 --> 00:23:01,621
The spicy beef tartare?
- Where's your handsome friend?

163
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,334
Don't embarrass her...
- Cool it. Who asked you?

164
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:08,712
Miss?

165
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,340
Miss Piaf, what an honour!
What can I do for you?

166
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,595
A lot. I'd like a present.
- But of course.

167
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:22,475
I wanted champagne, but I prefer a ring...

168
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:25,603
...a large ring studded with diamonds.

169
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:29,274
Don't bother. We'll have the champagne.

170
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,320
Here's to the love I feel for all of you...

171
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:37,490
...for which I stand. Help me up, someone.

172
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:44,706
A toast to Marguerite.

173
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:51,046
My composer and most loyal friend in the business.

174
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:56,468
Oh,don't blush so.You're making us weep.

175
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:16,279
What about a photograph?
- I don't think so.

176
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:21,993
Bubbles and alcohol, perfect!
That's Claude's doing.

177
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:27,415
<i>You're such a bore, Loulou.
We've just returned to Paris, and we're having fun.</i>

178
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:33,588
Stop playing the unhappy lover.

179
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,261
I'm waiting for someone.

180
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,933
Don't forget you've responsibilities.
There's more than you.

181
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,812
<i>Remember the first night in Gerney
's?</i>

182
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:53,274
I looked like a bag lady.
You thought I was a princess.

183
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,528
<i>You WERE a princess.
My princess!</i>

184
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:58,947
To Marguerite.

185
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:02,575
To all those who wished
to see me come a cropper.

186
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:06,037
They think I don't know!
Cheers!

187
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,047
What's the matter, Louis?
- He's in bad form.

188
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,425
Go away. We're busy.

189
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,520
You're not here as decoration.
Get to work.

190
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:57,065
To work, you.
This is no child's play.

191
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:00,193
You'll earn your keep. Enough!

192
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:06,866
Stupid child!
You're in everyone's way!

193
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:12,914
Go to the trailer.
See to the meal.

194
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:19,087
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for Louis, the Human Snake!

195
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:05,675
What a little angel.

196
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:09,846
How old is she?
- Ten.

197
00:28:11,097 --> 00:28:12,641
No mother?

198
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,309
What do you mean?

199
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,479
You be so lonely.

200
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,524
What about a calvados
in your trailer?

201
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:24,653
Let's go.

202
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:14,703
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

203
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,458
<i>I'm Theresa.</i>

204
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:24,296
<i>Are your eyes all right, sweetheart?</i>

205
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:26,589
Yes.

206
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:31,594
<i>You're so adorable.
Whom do wish to pray for?</i>

207
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,723
I want to pray for Titine.

208
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:38,893
<i>Very well. I shall look after you.</i>

209
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:40,562
<i>Never forget that.</i>

210
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,316
<i>Whenever you feel lonely,
remember I'm always here.</i>

211
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:04,419
Right, that's it!
You were supposed to change that wheel.

212
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,298
We're all in the same rotten boat!

213
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,094
I don't care!
- No? Then screw you!

214
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:19,434
You shouldn't let
that kind of thing get you down!

215
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:23,438
I can't stand Caroli!

216
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:25,815
You're drunk.
- I'm going solo.

217
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,860
Fat chance of that!
There aren't that many circuses.

218
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,863
I'll manage.

219
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:36,951
Just when I was getting used to you.
- You'll do okay without me!

220
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:47,921
Saint Theresa, please make him change his mind.
I don't want to leave the circus.

221
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:37,739
He's completely messed up.

222
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:48,875
Is the girl part of the act?

223
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,503
Hold on.
Do something.

224
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,757
Before they go, do something.

225
00:32:57,634 --> 00:32:59,719
Come on, do something.

226
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,111
Bravo!

227
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,664
That's my daughter!

228
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,676
Grasse. October 1963

229
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:29,392
I'm sick of this carrot juice.
- You'll drink it as long as I'm nursing you.

230
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:38,360
I like it dark.
- The sun will do you good.

231
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:56,086
It's hard I know,
but you need a lot of rest...

232
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,754
...and patience.

233
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:02,968
Your husband phoned today...
- No point.

234
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,432
What bothers me
is that I exaggerated.

235
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:14,854
The past 3 years were awful.

236
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,774
You're a performer.

237
00:35:20,694 --> 00:35:22,153
Simone?

238
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:30,287
I suppose I'll never sing again?

239
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,769
Paris, Montmartre.
October 1935

240
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:01,026
What's up with you?

241
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:03,236
I'm hungry.

242
00:36:32,432 --> 00:36:34,726
First we sing, then we eat.

243
00:36:34,934 --> 00:36:39,314
Sing alone and you're a beggar.
When you're a duo it's a show.

244
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:44,319
I want to sing here.

245
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,165
Hey, you!

246
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:00,168
No street singing allowed.

247
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,045
Is that a fact?

248
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,130
How old are you?
- Twenty.

249
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:05,924
What's that?

250
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:10,261
She's had hardly anything to drink.
- Come here.

251
00:37:10,804 --> 00:37:12,180
<i>Do you know 'Du Gris'?</i>

252
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:14,975
Oh, sir...
- Shut up!

253
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:20,689
If you sing that,I'll let you go.
That's my beat.I'll look the other way.

254
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:57,642
Next week it's our 21st.
Sisters for 5 years.

255
00:37:59,185 --> 00:38:02,522
What do you prefer, working with me
or in the factory?

256
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:07,319
I'd rather cut my own throat.
How about you?

257
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:09,070
What do you mean?

258
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:13,658
Killing yourself in your little milk shop?
- Shut up! Not while we're eating.

259
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,703
Anetta, no moaning, okay?

260
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:19,623
Look, it's your drunken mother.

261
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:26,713
Edith?

262
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:31,092
Do you have any change?

263
00:38:39,643 --> 00:38:44,022
That's all?
- I haven't much money.

264
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,858
Give me some bank notes.
- I don't have any.

265
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:52,155
I'm your mother.
- Go to hell!

266
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:58,203
Shall I sing a song?
- Throw her out!

267
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:03,833
I'm a performer. What about you?

268
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,252
You'll find out!

269
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,630
What'll I find out?
- When you're lying in the gutter.

270
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:13,218
Keep it down or leave!
- When you're in need...

271
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:14,803
Fuck off!

272
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:20,934
...don't depend on your daughter
giving you a bite to eat.

273
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:25,313
That's enough.
- I'm off. Have the rest if you want.

274
00:39:25,522 --> 00:39:29,693
You're no singer, you slut!
- Leave her alone or you'll answer to me.

275
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:33,863
Oh, don't bother with that lot!

276
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:36,074
Fuck you!

277
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,703
Go and prostitute yourself on the street!

278
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:42,914
While you still can!

279
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:47,836
Thanks very much.

280
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:41,931
You'll ruin your voice doing that.
- I have to eat.

281
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,808
Of course you do.

282
00:40:45,185 --> 00:40:47,145
I'm Louis Leplée.

283
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:52,067
<i>Here's my card. Come round to Gerney's,
tomorrow at two.</i>

284
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:55,904
Are you a singer?
- No, but I have other talents.

285
00:40:56,154 --> 00:41:00,075
Bring your music with you,
whatever you intend singing.

286
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:02,702
What if I don't come?

287
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:07,207
That's up to you, my girl.

288
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:34,943
This is all you have to show for a whole day?
This is how you reward my belief in you?

289
00:41:35,443 --> 00:41:38,154
I've put a little aside for my father.
He's sick and he's broke.

290
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:41,908
I'm not a social worker.
- No really. He's sick.

291
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:48,039
If I toss you out on the street
maybe you'll get it.

292
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,207
Let her go!

293
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:54,004
Never! I'd rather starve than be a whore.

294
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:57,132
If you die, it's your own fault!
- Shut up!

295
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,885
I want MORE, is that clear?

296
00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:04,306
Or you spread your legs, just like the rest.

297
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,099
You first.

298
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,403
Albert, I'm sorry...

299
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,657
Please stay!
- Leave the bastard.

300
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,373
Give her something to drink.

301
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,336
Are you coming to the Chinese?
- Who else is going?

302
00:42:34,544 --> 00:42:36,755
The two Italians.

303
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:42,385
Plenty of snuff and tobacco.
And the warmth of another body...

304
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:48,642
Because we did it once,
doesn't mean I wish to do it again.

305
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,853
Don't start.
- Shall I explain?

306
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:55,398
I care not a jot for you,
and you want to know why?

307
00:42:55,649 --> 00:43:00,862
No, I'm too stupid?
Because I'm an artist.

308
00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:05,116
I'm going to the top. I know it.
I've always known it!

309
00:43:08,662 --> 00:43:10,455
It's the Little Flower...

310
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:14,709
...Saint Theresa,
I foresee great things.

311
00:43:21,383 --> 00:43:24,844
Seen her clothes?
She looks ill.

312
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,139
Where did he find her?

313
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:46,741
She's unbelievable.

314
00:43:48,076 --> 00:43:49,244
Champagne.

315
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:53,081
The boss is crazy about her.
- What a voice!

316
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:02,882
She's really something, Louis.
- Spare me your jealousy, Josette.

317
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,206
What's your name again?
- Edith Giovanna Gassion.

318
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:39,586
Hmm, not very impressive.
- I have other names:

319
00:44:39,794 --> 00:44:42,297
Huguette Helias, Tania...

320
00:44:43,632 --> 00:44:46,176
...Denise Jay.

321
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:50,639
You've had a manicure!
- That wasn't the question.

322
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:56,144
You're just like a bird.
- You think so?

323
00:44:56,353 --> 00:44:57,646
Really?

324
00:44:57,812 --> 00:45:01,483
<i>Is 'Little Bird' taken?
- Yes, it's taken.</i>

325
00:45:02,108 --> 00:45:03,777
A sparrow...

326
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:08,865
<i>Would you call a sparrow 'piaf'?
Is that how you say it?</i>

327
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:13,495
<i>The Little Sparrow.
- Brilliant!</i>

328
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:16,706
It's stupid.
- What would YOU know?

329
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,834
<i>The Little Sparrow.
- Brilliant!</i>

330
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:25,048
<i>You'll need a suitable repertoire.
Bruants 'Les Mômes de la Cloche'.</i>

331
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:29,427
I know it.
- If necessary practise it all night.

332
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,138
We'll start you on Friday.

333
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:36,601
Show's beginning.

334
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:40,063
Take care of your protégée.
She's a slow starter.

335
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:41,856
I'm on my way.

336
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:47,696
Philippo, no more alcohol backstage.

337
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:58,415
What are you doing?
- I'd no time to finish it.

338
00:45:58,623 --> 00:46:02,294
I'm knitting the sleeve.
- Now! We've a full house.

339
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,505
All the more reason!
She can't go on like that!

340
00:46:05,714 --> 00:46:09,968
Look, our star is dressing the newcomer.

341
00:46:10,927 --> 00:46:14,264
That's fine.
- Girls, let's go.

342
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:18,226
I have to throw up.
- Not now. Hurry up.

343
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:28,862
A day or two ago, on my way home,
Lady Luck led me...

344
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,947
...to the artist you'll see tonight.

345
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:35,744
Here she is, exactly as I first saw her,
an unpolished jewel:

346
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:40,123
<i>From the street to Gerny's:
The Little Sparrow.</i>

347
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:11,756
She's like a sister to me.

348
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:35,030
Did I lie?
- She's extraordinary.

349
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,917
This is the great Jean Mermoz.

350
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,419
This is for you.

351
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,630
Thank you.

352
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:35,298
Come along, Edith.

353
00:49:36,424 --> 00:49:39,678
You've won them over.
And you'll continue doing just that...

354
00:49:39,886 --> 00:49:43,348
...I'm introducing you to someone
who can help your career along.

355
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:50,522
I'm Marguerite Monnot.
I'm a pianist.

356
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:54,067
If you need music,I'll gladly supply it.

357
00:49:54,275 --> 00:49:56,778
Thank you.
- Come.

358
00:49:57,404 --> 00:50:03,118
<i>Edith, this is Mr. Jacques Canetti.
Artistic director of Radio Cité.</i>

359
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:07,706
Miss, I was under your spell.
- Thank you.

360
00:50:07,956 --> 00:50:12,002
Please, join us at our table.
- I can't. I have to go.

361
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,379
What can be so important?

362
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:17,549
Thank you.

363
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:18,675
What's the matter?

364
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,760
Wonderful, wonderful...

365
00:50:28,977 --> 00:50:33,273
Get out right now or I'll...
- Hit him in the kisser!

366
00:50:33,481 --> 00:50:36,318
I've waited an hour for you!

367
00:50:36,484 --> 00:50:39,237
Go to hell, you bastard!

368
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:44,743
Stop it.

369
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:45,303
Miss, you're wonderful.

370
00:51:40,966 --> 00:51:45,303
My hand's about to fall off.
More bubbles.

371
00:51:45,553 --> 00:51:47,514
Give me the bottle.

372
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:53,478
I said you should listen to me. Radio is
a powerful medium, am I right, Coquatrix?

373
00:51:53,645 --> 00:51:57,315
<i>But don't underestimate the Music Hall.
- Of course not.</i>

374
00:51:58,233 --> 00:51:59,901
I've something for you.

375
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:01,903
A song?
- Of course.

376
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,283
Raymond!
Mireille, fetch Raymond !

377
00:52:08,368 --> 00:52:11,496
Somebody here for you.

378
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:17,836
That big guy wants to see you.

379
00:52:18,795 --> 00:52:24,926
This is Raymond Asso.
Writer, composer, poet.

380
00:52:26,011 --> 00:52:27,137
I'll be right back.

381
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:28,805
I love your work.

382
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:32,267
I don't love your face.

383
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:39,774
I've seen you often.

384
00:52:41,026 --> 00:52:42,569
I haven't seen you.

385
00:52:44,237 --> 00:52:46,615
Midnight, everyone on their feet!

386
00:53:05,717 --> 00:53:09,888
You're a big star.
- Yes, I wear high heels.

387
00:53:15,644 --> 00:53:19,147
If you wish...
Call me. I'll be waiting.

388
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:41,503
Papa Leplée!

389
00:53:43,046 --> 00:53:46,591
A toast to Papa Leplée,
my saviour.

390
00:53:50,762 --> 00:53:55,767
Grasse. October 1963

391
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:58,830
He was a very discreet man...

392
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:04,919
Were you here yesterday?
- Yes, but I didn't see him.

393
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:09,174
So he was at home.
- Perhaps. Too bad.

394
00:55:09,382 --> 00:55:13,261
He was discreet,
so lovely and attentive.

395
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:46,920
You bring bad luck!

396
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,219
It's her fault!

397
00:56:00,976 --> 00:56:03,186
<i>Are you the Little Sparrow?</i>

398
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,817
Come with me, please.
- Why?

399
00:56:09,025 --> 00:56:10,485
This way.

400
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:13,488
Let me through.

401
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:17,158
I'm talking to you.

402
00:56:17,492 --> 00:56:19,995
Have you ties with the underworld?
- No.

403
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:23,498
Leave me alone.

404
00:56:23,748 --> 00:56:29,337
And Henri Valette? And George, Johnny the
Sailor and Albert? Never heard of them?

405
00:56:29,879 --> 00:56:32,590
Those are friends of mine.They've nothing to do with this

406
00:56:33,425 --> 00:56:39,055
Being an accessory is a criminal offence.
- I'm innocent! I've done nothing.

407
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:42,517
I've lost everything.
- Where were you last night?

408
00:56:42,684 --> 00:56:45,520
I told you: partying...

409
00:56:47,272 --> 00:56:51,151
Bastards, swine!
This is disgusting!

410
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,528
We're not in the theatre now.

411
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:57,824
It seems you have a couple of nasty friends.

412
00:56:58,033 --> 00:57:02,537
They're not like that.
- Sure, and I'm a cretin.

413
00:57:05,123 --> 00:57:07,626
Have you an explanation?
- Not at this time.

414
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:10,045
It's a disgrace!

415
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:14,382
Go back to the gutter, slag!
- Leave her alone!

416
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:18,261
She didn't do it!
- Have you named names?

417
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,889
This is a funeral.
Have a little respect!

418
00:57:25,143 --> 00:57:28,480
Just one more question.
- Vultures! Go away!

419
00:57:29,522 --> 00:57:31,608
Out of the way!
Get the hell out of here!

420
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:36,613
It's over. I'm dead.
I've been dragged through the shit.

421
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:40,158
Forget it.

422
00:57:40,575 --> 00:57:43,495
I haven't done anything!
- I know that.

423
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:47,582
Open up!

424
00:57:56,758 --> 00:57:58,927
What?
- Simone Berteaut?

425
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:01,012
Yes.

426
00:58:01,513 --> 00:58:04,683
Miss, please come with us.

427
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,518
Why?

428
00:58:07,185 --> 00:58:12,065
Your mother has arranged with the court
for you to be placed in a boarding school.

429
00:58:12,482 --> 00:58:17,279
Immediately.
Pack your things.

430
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:21,658
No! She's staying here.
- This has nothing to do with you.

431
00:58:22,701 --> 00:58:25,537
For the last time: go and pack.

432
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:32,294
You want to see me dead!
That's it, isn't it?

433
00:58:33,336 --> 00:58:37,924
Let me go!
- She's staying here. Momone!

434
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:40,302
Edith, don't let them!

435
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:45,974
My things! I don't have any things!
Do you hear that, you shit?

436
00:58:46,808 --> 00:58:50,312
Momone, no!

437
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,281
Papa Leplée...

438
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,412
Oh, Papa Leplée...

439
00:59:16,296 --> 00:59:18,798
You killed him.
Where's the money?

440
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:24,220
What can you expect from
a former whore?

441
01:00:06,346 --> 01:00:10,809
Everybody out of the dressing room!
Mamy, you stay.

442
01:00:17,607 --> 01:00:20,652
I need a shot for the pain.

443
01:00:47,095 --> 01:00:49,180
Get the American.

444
01:00:54,019 --> 01:00:56,187
You can come in now.

445
01:01:01,276 --> 01:01:04,529
A triumph. You were magnificent.
- Doug?

446
01:01:07,782 --> 01:01:12,537
I need fresh air.
I'm going back with you to Chálons.

447
01:01:14,748 --> 01:01:17,959
But that's 400 kilometres away.

448
01:01:19,336 --> 01:01:23,298
You can go to hell!
I'm sick of you all!

449
01:01:23,506 --> 01:01:26,551
You're exhausted.
It's a long journey.

450
01:01:26,718 --> 01:01:30,180
No, no, always no!
Drop dead!

451
01:01:49,157 --> 01:01:50,742
Let's go back.

452
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:52,410
Turn around!

453
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,581
You've ruined it for me!
- What's this...

454
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:13,014
<i>The blood test is a catastrophe.</i>

455
01:02:13,264 --> 01:02:17,310
She has two broken ribs we're unable to set.
This is going to take weeks.

456
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:21,773
<i>I'd cancel all engagements.</i>

457
01:02:30,865 --> 01:02:32,742
It's tight enough. Please leave.

458
01:02:33,576 --> 01:02:36,496
Doctor, give me an injection so I can sing.

459
01:02:36,705 --> 01:02:39,833
My admiration knows no bounds.

460
01:02:40,542 --> 01:02:43,295
That may be, but I have none.

461
01:02:43,586 --> 01:02:46,298
Cancel the concert.
You're risking your life.

462
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:49,843
What's life without risk?

463
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:53,179
What would you say to a new life?
Change your surroundings.

464
01:02:53,722 --> 01:02:55,890
My what?
- Your surroundings.

465
01:02:56,808 --> 01:02:59,227
Why didn't you call me sooner?

466
01:02:59,436 --> 01:03:03,189
I was busy. I didn't know
what you wanted of me.

467
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:06,818
I saw you sing.
You have much to learn.

468
01:03:07,235 --> 01:03:09,738
No one's ever said that before.

469
01:03:09,988 --> 01:03:14,451
<i>In three months' time you won't be that'girl'any more.
Your bar days are over.</i>

470
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:17,078
<i>He had clear blue eyes
That flashed like lightning</i>

471
01:03:17,245 --> 01:03:19,873
<i>in a storm in the night</i>

472
01:03:21,124 --> 01:03:24,753
In-a-storm-in-the-night!
Articulation!

473
01:03:25,587 --> 01:03:26,755
Again!

474
01:03:28,423 --> 01:03:30,300
<i>He had clear blue eyes</i>

475
01:03:31,843 --> 01:03:35,722
Are those words or noises?

476
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:38,516
What do want of me?
- Perfect diction!

477
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:41,978
I sing as I speak.
- Badly.

478
01:03:42,687 --> 01:03:46,566
You shout the words
and they lose their meaning.

479
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:50,320
More slowly, Marguerite.

480
01:03:50,528 --> 01:03:52,614
We've been at it six hours.
Can someone open a window?

481
01:03:52,822 --> 01:03:54,783
We'll be doing breathing shortly.

482
01:03:55,533 --> 01:03:56,868
From the top.

483
01:04:00,747 --> 01:04:05,126
<i>He had clear blue eyes, that flashed
like lightning. In a storm...</i>

484
01:04:05,335 --> 01:04:08,046
You're not paying attention!
You're not creating.

485
01:04:09,798 --> 01:04:12,842
<i>You must become the woman in love.</i>

486
01:04:13,885 --> 01:04:15,553
Think as an actress.

487
01:04:19,307 --> 01:04:20,642
He's making fun of me.

488
01:04:20,892 --> 01:04:23,561
We're all tired. We'll take a break.

489
01:04:25,772 --> 01:04:28,400
He makes me feel as if I can't sing.

490
01:04:28,566 --> 01:04:30,652
Who do you think you are?

491
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:34,114
Don't be satisfied with half measures.

492
01:04:34,948 --> 01:04:37,158
I've been singing since I was nine years old.

493
01:04:37,325 --> 01:04:41,204
Take it easy.
This is new and difficult.

494
01:04:41,746 --> 01:04:46,209
You're interpreting something, understand?
You must LIVE the song!

495
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,838
No one's ever had a problem
with my diction before.

496
01:04:50,088 --> 01:04:52,882
No one... like whom?

497
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:56,344
<i>The riff-raff in Gerny's?
Or on the street?</i>

498
01:05:05,186 --> 01:05:08,189
Do what I say or go back to the gutter.

499
01:05:14,696 --> 01:05:16,239
Edith!

500
01:05:23,747 --> 01:05:26,875
Here's to my girl who never forgets her vader.

501
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:28,960
To my little one!

502
01:05:29,169 --> 01:05:32,088
Your mentor, is he rich?

503
01:05:32,505 --> 01:05:34,799
Not a cent... He does it
for the love of art.

504
01:05:35,008 --> 01:05:37,719
For the love of your arse you mean!

505
01:05:37,927 --> 01:05:42,307
Come on, little one, sing.
- Sing for us!

506
01:06:34,442 --> 01:06:36,736
That's the way to treat her.

507
01:06:37,362 --> 01:06:39,364
I let her have her own way.

508
01:06:41,116 --> 01:06:43,285
I was too good to her!

509
01:07:09,269 --> 01:07:12,188
You're too stiff.

510
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:16,568
Like a bare-knuckle fighter.
Performing is an art.

511
01:07:17,402 --> 01:07:19,988
You have to grab the audience.

512
01:07:20,655 --> 01:07:24,075
You have lovely hands.
Use them.

513
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:25,744
Sing with them.

514
01:07:25,952 --> 01:07:27,495
Again, Marguerite.

515
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,752
Move them.

516
01:07:35,545 --> 01:07:37,213
The hands!

517
01:07:41,092 --> 01:07:42,427
That's it.

518
01:07:44,596 --> 01:07:46,806
I look stupid.
- Continue.

519
01:07:57,233 --> 01:07:58,693
Put this on.

520
01:07:59,861 --> 01:08:03,281
That's not what people want.
It's my voice they wish to hear.

521
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:07,243
How can you be so talented
and at the same time so dense?

522
01:08:33,937 --> 01:08:36,231
Open the door.
- I have to throw up!

523
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:39,651
Is she drunk?
- She's in panic.

524
01:08:41,653 --> 01:08:43,738
The audience is waiting.

525
01:08:46,658 --> 01:08:49,160
For weeks you've been pestering me for this gig.

526
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:52,914
For God's sake take the stage
before the tear the place apart.

527
01:08:53,123 --> 01:08:54,582
She's on her way.

528
01:08:55,834 --> 01:08:58,962
Edith?
Three minutes.

529
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:05,010
This isn't a bar, it's a theatre.
What am I doing here?

530
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:09,389
Stage fright.
It's a good sign.

531
01:09:14,811 --> 01:09:16,187
Edith?

532
01:09:17,314 --> 01:09:18,440
What?

533
01:09:20,233 --> 01:09:23,987
This is it.
This is what we worked hard for.

534
01:09:24,195 --> 01:09:26,281
You can't back down now.

535
01:09:28,992 --> 01:09:30,368
Open the door.

536
01:09:31,703 --> 01:09:33,872
No, I can't do it.

537
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,959
Please, open the door.

538
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:43,298
On your feet.

539
01:12:33,134 --> 01:12:36,054
Ladies and gentlemen, Edith Piaf!

540
01:12:43,895 --> 01:12:47,732
<i>...Edith Piaf Triumphs...
...Fame for Street Singer...</i>

541
01:12:48,566 --> 01:12:50,443
<i>...The Little Sparrow Premieres...</i>

542
01:12:52,862 --> 01:12:55,156
<i>...The first man
Who Helped Me...</i>

543
01:12:57,826 --> 01:12:59,202
<i>...Piaf On Tour...</i>

544
01:13:04,499 --> 01:13:07,127
<i>...Edith Piaf's Appearance
in the A.B.C. Theatre...</i>

545
01:13:23,101 --> 01:13:26,605
<i>The Little Sparrow is Dead
Long Live Edith Piaf!</i>

546
01:13:41,536 --> 01:13:46,458
<i>"I was hurrying home,
needing your love to lean on,</i>

547
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:52,714
<i>...only to find an empty room.
Waiting and waiting; I know that room."</i>

548
01:13:52,881 --> 01:13:57,302
I can't wait to see you in this piece.
Look out, here comes Canetti.

549
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:01,681
The conductor's been waiting three hours.
- So?

550
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:04,351
The premiere is less than 48 hours away.

551
01:14:04,559 --> 01:14:08,021
Do you know many people whom
Cocteau's written a piece for?

552
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,732
Miss?
- Yes, Suzanne?

553
01:14:10,941 --> 01:14:14,903
Meurisse called.
Dinner with Mr. Cocteau at eight.

554
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:16,571
You see?

555
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:20,325
Ask him to come back at midnight.
- Are you sure?

556
01:14:20,533 --> 01:14:24,287
You're worse than Raymond.
Do this, do that.

557
01:14:24,621 --> 01:14:27,624
That's why you fired him.
- Stop it.

558
01:14:27,832 --> 01:14:31,252
Do you wish to see the gowns?
- Yes, the gowns.

559
01:14:39,219 --> 01:14:43,682
That's all of them.
Careful with those pins.

560
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:46,518
The simplest one, without the collar.

561
01:14:50,146 --> 01:14:53,191
There's a man at the door...
He has something for you.

562
01:14:53,358 --> 01:14:55,151
Who is it?
- A soldier.

563
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,948
I told him you were busy.
He's outside in the corridor.A bit embarrassed.

564
01:15:00,156 --> 01:15:02,450
Have him come in.

565
01:15:10,792 --> 01:15:12,043
Will you come this way?

566
01:15:19,551 --> 01:15:23,221
Here she is.
- Much better without the collar.

567
01:15:24,139 --> 01:15:25,598
Yes?

568
01:15:26,016 --> 01:15:28,935
My name is Michel Emer.
I'm a corporal.

569
01:15:29,144 --> 01:15:32,063
This isn't the army.
What do you want?

570
01:15:35,734 --> 01:15:37,152
I have a song for you.

571
01:15:37,402 --> 01:15:42,282
Not another... I've enough already.
I have a premiere in two days' time.

572
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:43,867
I wish this one.

573
01:15:44,075 --> 01:15:46,328
Tomorrow I leave for the front.

574
01:15:50,206 --> 01:15:52,917
There's the piano.
You have five minutes.

575
01:15:57,589 --> 01:15:59,049
Edith...

576
01:16:01,885 --> 01:16:03,845
We shall have to wait.

577
01:16:41,508 --> 01:16:43,051
Stop.

578
01:16:45,053 --> 01:16:46,638
I want it.

579
01:16:47,013 --> 01:16:48,598
Everybody out.

580
01:16:50,392 --> 01:16:53,186
You can't mean that.
We're already late.

581
01:16:53,395 --> 01:16:55,063
What can't she mean?

582
01:16:55,272 --> 01:16:57,983
Play it.
I want it for Bobino.

583
01:17:01,736 --> 01:17:03,321
You can't do that.

584
01:17:03,488 --> 01:17:07,575
Edith Piaf can do whatever she pleases!

585
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:17,794
French, please.

586
01:17:18,003 --> 01:17:21,881
She's too hopeless, too poor...
- Help us out here, Charles.

587
01:17:22,173 --> 01:17:24,050
I'm no translator.

588
01:17:24,467 --> 01:17:30,307
<i>'Miserable. And not in the French
tradition of the Can-Can and Gay Paris.'</i>

589
01:17:30,515 --> 01:17:31,850
A complete flop.

590
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,604
This isn't the first time I've had to fight.

591
01:17:35,937 --> 01:17:38,648
The Americans want pretty girls, not me.

592
01:17:38,857 --> 01:17:42,527
I'm not the Parisian sex bomb
you were hoping for.

593
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:47,616
Can you picture me in a ballet?
With a feather in my arse?

594
01:17:54,914 --> 01:17:57,626
Go ahead and laugh.
I'm not what they want.

595
01:17:57,917 --> 01:18:01,296
They think I'm too doleful, THEY are stupid.
- Yes, too stupid.

596
01:18:01,588 --> 01:18:05,133
.

597
01:18:06,259 --> 01:18:08,053
.

598
01:18:10,889 --> 01:18:13,141
You made the front page.
- Two columns.

599
01:18:13,391 --> 01:18:14,726
.

600
01:18:14,935 --> 01:18:19,230
.

601
01:18:19,397 --> 01:18:22,233
.

602
01:18:29,324 --> 01:18:31,910
I can't read it.
Translate it.

603
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:37,540
He says that she shouldn't let you go.
That it would be a mistake.

604
01:18:37,749 --> 01:18:40,377
The Americans don't deserve you.

605
01:18:41,628 --> 01:18:44,673
I knew something would happen!
I have to change...

606
01:18:44,965 --> 01:18:47,384
...Ginou, help me help me choose a dress.

607
01:18:49,135 --> 01:18:52,263
I'm going out tonight. I have a date.

608
01:19:01,523 --> 01:19:02,899
.

609
01:19:06,736 --> 01:19:09,781
What's this, Marcel?
- Beef...try it.

610
01:19:12,909 --> 01:19:14,786
It smells like damp dog.

611
01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:18,540
.

612
01:19:18,873 --> 01:19:19,582
What?

613
01:19:19,874 --> 01:19:23,044
.

614
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:24,587
.

615
01:19:26,256 --> 01:19:28,967
Your English is as good as the meat.

616
01:19:36,057 --> 01:19:37,934
Don't you like it here?

617
01:19:38,977 --> 01:19:41,479
I was taken a bit by surprise.
I didn't expect it...

618
01:19:42,522 --> 01:19:49,946
...when you phoned to say that as two French people
in New York we should have a meal...

619
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:54,618
...I didn't expect this.
- I come here all the time.

620
01:19:58,997 --> 01:20:01,916
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

621
01:20:14,638 --> 01:20:18,808
Have you decided?
- Twee broodjes pastrami.

622
01:20:19,643 --> 01:20:27,150
I'll handle this: two Tournedos Rossini,
and a bottle of Chateau Langelus 1938.

623
01:20:31,863 --> 01:20:36,117
Are you hungry?
- It's better than cooked dog.

624
01:20:37,285 --> 01:20:38,703
I'm sorry.

625
01:20:39,245 --> 01:20:42,165
Let's start over. Okay?

626
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:48,213
How long have you been in New York?
- Eight weeks.

627
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:53,218
And do you like America?
- It doesn't interest me at all.

628
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:55,720
I don't understand them,
and they don't understand me.

629
01:20:55,929 --> 01:20:58,431
You must miss Paris.
- Terribly.

630
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,226
What do you do when you're not singing?

631
01:21:03,436 --> 01:21:07,399
Your like the police with your questions.
I knit.

632
01:21:08,233 --> 01:21:11,778
Give me your size and
I'll knit you a sweater.

633
01:21:11,987 --> 01:21:13,571
No, but thanks all the same...

634
01:21:15,657 --> 01:21:18,868
Those people recognized you.
- Really?

635
01:21:21,788 --> 01:21:26,584
<i>They said: 'That schmuck lost his
recent fights. He's washed up.'</i>

636
01:21:26,793 --> 01:21:29,504
I'll show them who's washed up.
- No!

637
01:21:30,338 --> 01:21:33,258
Relax. I was joking.

638
01:21:45,562 --> 01:21:47,022
It's fine.

639
01:21:57,741 --> 01:22:00,785
Can we be less formal to each other?
- Of course.

640
01:22:01,536 --> 01:22:05,707
What do you do when you aren't boxing?
- I train and I run...

641
01:22:05,874 --> 01:22:10,587
And after the training?
- ln Morocco I work on my farm.

642
01:22:11,296 --> 01:22:13,089
You have a farm?

643
01:22:13,715 --> 01:22:15,592
I breed pigs.

644
01:22:20,388 --> 01:22:22,265
Well, why not?

645
01:22:25,602 --> 01:22:27,479
Absolutely. Why not?

646
01:22:27,687 --> 01:22:30,899
It's a fine farm: modern, with superb, fat pigs.

647
01:22:31,232 --> 01:22:34,235
Who takes care of them when you're boxing?
- My wife.

648
01:22:42,827 --> 01:22:44,245
You have...

649
01:22:45,497 --> 01:22:46,873
...wonderful hands.

650
01:22:49,501 --> 01:22:53,463
Did you hear what I said, Momone?
- You have really beautiful fingers.

651
01:22:55,423 --> 01:22:56,758
Listen.

652
01:22:57,008 --> 01:22:59,094
What colour are your eyes?

653
01:22:59,594 --> 01:23:03,765
He leaned over...
- And his breath smelled.

654
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:07,310
You can be such a bitch!
- He is of course a pig breeder.

655
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:10,355
He said...
- Violet blue.

656
01:23:10,647 --> 01:23:12,440
Of course, violet blue.

657
01:23:12,941 --> 01:23:16,903
It was the way he said it.
As though he was a child.

658
01:23:18,571 --> 01:23:22,325
Then he said:
- You're just like a fairy.

659
01:23:23,368 --> 01:23:25,787
A bit of an exaggeration.

660
01:23:55,066 --> 01:23:58,486
Did you kiss him?
- I didn't dare.

661
01:23:59,988 --> 01:24:02,991
It was a wonderful evening.
- Too short.

662
01:24:05,827 --> 01:24:09,664
Will you come and see me box?
- Of course.

663
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:14,336
Did he try to kiss you?

664
01:24:14,794 --> 01:24:17,088
I don't know if he even thought about it.

665
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:19,466
And I'm supposed to believe that!

666
01:24:19,674 --> 01:24:21,760
I'll come to see you sing.

667
01:24:25,805 --> 01:24:27,599
Goodnight.

668
01:24:31,978 --> 01:24:34,272
He's the love of my life...

669
01:26:07,282 --> 01:26:09,576
You were superb.

670
01:26:09,784 --> 01:26:13,747
Mr. Lucien Roupp,
Mr. Cerdan's manager.

671
01:26:14,164 --> 01:26:17,709
Mr. Jameson,
of CBS television.

672
01:26:17,917 --> 01:26:20,962
.

673
01:26:33,016 --> 01:26:34,392
Marlene.

674
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,900
Good evening. I'm sorry,
I just wanted to say something.

675
01:26:44,402 --> 01:26:47,238
I haven't been in Paris in years.

676
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:52,953
But this evening,when you sang
I was right back there again..

677
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,956
...on her streets, beneath her skies.

678
01:26:56,414 --> 01:26:59,834
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

679
01:27:00,251 --> 01:27:04,506
You took me with you on your travels.
You brought tears to my eyes.

680
01:27:05,882 --> 01:27:10,261
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you.

681
01:27:48,717 --> 01:27:50,302
Come on.

682
01:27:56,766 --> 01:28:01,646
I'm beginning to like this city.
The stars are out tonight.

683
01:28:02,314 --> 01:28:04,065
Let's go.

684
01:28:19,289 --> 01:28:23,335
Marc, do you know how long
a frog lives for?

685
01:28:24,502 --> 01:28:26,588
In fairytales or in real life?

686
01:28:29,215 --> 01:28:32,844
No one ever read me fairytales.

687
01:28:33,386 --> 01:28:35,972
You never had the chance to hear them.

688
01:28:37,015 --> 01:28:40,352
That's true, but all the same...

689
01:29:28,316 --> 01:29:32,487
Dreux. 13 December 1959

690
01:30:13,695 --> 01:30:15,113
I'm a little tired.

691
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:18,366
I'll be right back.

692
01:30:38,511 --> 01:30:40,388
Lay her down there.

693
01:30:48,396 --> 01:30:51,024
I'll go back on in a minute.
- Out of the question.

694
01:30:51,232 --> 01:30:53,193
Nobody tells ME when to stop.

695
01:30:53,902 --> 01:30:57,489
What are we going to do?
- Sorry, you'll have to clear the house.

696
01:30:57,989 --> 01:31:00,408
I'm going back there!
- No, Edith.

697
01:31:00,575 --> 01:31:03,203
I have to continue.
- It would be suicide.

698
01:31:03,411 --> 01:31:04,746
You're going to hospital.

699
01:31:06,539 --> 01:31:09,668
No, I'm begging you!

700
01:31:09,876 --> 01:31:14,756
She left hospital only three weeks ago.
There'll be more galas.

701
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:18,718
Take me back to the stage.

702
01:31:19,469 --> 01:31:21,763
I have to sing.

703
01:31:21,972 --> 01:31:25,100
I have to sing, Louis.
I have no choice.

704
01:31:25,934 --> 01:31:28,770
Edith, please...

705
01:31:29,354 --> 01:31:32,190
Can't you hear them?
- Stop...

706
01:31:33,441 --> 01:31:34,776
Shut that door!

707
01:31:35,318 --> 01:31:36,987
Take me back there, Louis.

708
01:31:37,529 --> 01:31:41,283
If I don't sing tonight...

709
01:31:41,866 --> 01:31:48,873
If I don't sing one song at least,
I'll lose faith in myself. Do you follow?

710
01:32:04,097 --> 01:32:05,348
Doctor...

711
01:32:07,142 --> 01:32:08,893
...do what you have to do.

712
01:32:35,086 --> 01:32:38,298
Not this time, boys.

713
01:32:38,715 --> 01:32:42,177
You think I'm going to collapse,
but I'm in great shape.

714
01:32:42,344 --> 01:32:45,180
Don't you dare write that this is my suicide tour!

715
01:32:50,602 --> 01:32:52,062
<i>'Padam'!</i>

716
01:34:22,694 --> 01:34:26,031
<i>Saint Theresa,
first of all my thanks...</i>

717
01:34:26,948 --> 01:34:31,870
<i>I know you're behind it all.
You sent him to me.</i>

718
01:34:32,787 --> 01:34:36,625
<i>I've found love,
thanks to you.</i>

719
01:34:37,459 --> 01:34:41,129
<i>Baby Jesus,
protect Marcel.</i>

720
01:35:57,455 --> 01:35:58,707
Come on, Marcel!

721
01:36:01,126 --> 01:36:02,127
No!

722
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:05,797
It's too early, Edith.
- He's going to win. I feel it.

723
01:36:06,298 --> 01:36:08,633
If things go wrong, you've a problem.
- What do you mean?

724
01:36:11,303 --> 01:36:14,139
If there's no problem,
I'll call you. Now go.

725
01:36:26,651 --> 01:36:27,902
Hurry up!

726
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,629
Come on, Marcel!

727
01:37:02,312 --> 01:37:04,397
One more round!

728
01:37:19,537 --> 01:37:20,956
Come on, Marcel!

729
01:37:25,794 --> 01:37:27,337
Finish him off!

730
01:38:05,834 --> 01:38:08,420
What's happening?
- Zale is sitting it out.

731
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:39,284
Did he do it?
Is he the world champion?

732
01:39:41,429 --> 01:39:43,515
You look like an angel.

733
01:39:45,392 --> 01:39:47,602
Not a fairy any more?

734
01:39:54,442 --> 01:39:56,361
You're my champion.

735
01:39:56,528 --> 01:39:59,030
I want to be with you always.

736
01:39:59,698 --> 01:40:03,118
There was nothing before I met you.
All that is in the past.

737
01:40:07,706 --> 01:40:09,374
Stay with me.

738
01:40:13,878 --> 01:40:18,133
<i>My dearest, before going to bed last night
I crossed off a day...</i>

739
01:40:18,341 --> 01:40:21,469
<i>...a day that was long and short.</i>

740
01:40:21,678 --> 01:40:27,642
<i>Such pain, that plane flew away with my heart.
My life, my breath...</i>

741
01:40:27,809 --> 01:40:31,146
<i>...my sweet boy,
my child, my dearest love...</i>

742
01:40:31,396 --> 01:40:36,151
<i>...your scent is still on my sheets,
and my heart sleeps without waking...</i>

743
01:40:36,401 --> 01:40:38,653
<i>...in the arms of sadness.</i>

744
01:40:38,903 --> 01:40:43,491
<i>Darling, I love you.
What have you done to me?</i>

745
01:40:43,783 --> 01:40:44,743
<i>I miss you.</i>

746
01:40:44,909 --> 01:40:49,414
<i>I'm depressed, lifeless,
as though I'm waiting for something...</i>

747
01:40:49,623 --> 01:40:57,422
<i>...hold me close against your heart and
know that nothing means more to me than you.</i>

748
01:40:57,839 --> 01:41:02,552
<i>Bring me back my heart.</i>

749
01:41:02,761 --> 01:41:06,514
<i>Whenever I'm in a restaurant and
hear 'La Vie en Rose'...</i>

750
01:41:06,723 --> 01:41:13,396
<i>If I see, my love, how devoted you are
to your wife and children...</i>

751
01:41:13,605 --> 01:41:15,607
<i>...I have the urge to go far away...</i>

752
01:41:15,774 --> 01:41:20,278
<i>...and perhaps one day you'll be
grateful for what I've done.</i>

753
01:41:20,487 --> 01:41:24,866
<i>I can't have you to myself
and I can't live without you.</i>

754
01:41:25,075 --> 01:41:28,828
<i>As God is my witness,I ask nothing for myself...</i>

755
01:41:29,037 --> 01:41:31,748
<i>...and am prepared to sacrifice everything.</i>

756
01:41:33,625 --> 01:41:36,753
<i>'If life were to take you from me...</i>

757
01:41:36,962 --> 01:41:41,466
<i>...if you should die or be far away,
and you were to love me, I too would die.'</i>

758
01:41:46,346 --> 01:41:50,308
In three months' time,
wait for it, in April...

759
01:41:50,517 --> 01:41:55,313
<i>...I'm going to star in L'Olympia.
Full house and then we're back again.</i>

760
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:59,484
Your liver is damaged...

761
01:41:59,693 --> 01:42:02,821
...you've been ill and need rest.
It's serious this time.

762
01:42:03,029 --> 01:42:05,657
I'm only 44.
I'm not dead yet.

763
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:08,994
Because of all the cancellations
we're broke.

764
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,371
Oh, so it's my fault?

765
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:15,000
I didn't say that.
The taxman is breathing down our necks.

766
01:42:15,542 --> 01:42:18,336
<i>We have to pay 120.000 franc.</i>

767
01:42:19,004 --> 01:42:24,092
I only have jaundice! That won't last
100 years. Don't exaggerate.

768
01:42:24,843 --> 01:42:27,637
<i>I want to sing in L'Olympia.</i>

769
01:42:34,436 --> 01:42:38,773
Anything else?
- We shouldn't give in all the time.

770
01:42:39,024 --> 01:42:43,778
I can't watch her all the time.
She discharged herself too soon from hospital.

771
01:42:44,029 --> 01:42:48,074
<i>L'Olympia is in 3 months.
That's going to be a disaster.</i>

772
01:42:48,283 --> 01:42:52,120
She needs this sort of challenge.
- This is hopeless.

773
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:56,124
In that case I'll have to tell the insurers
that we're cancelling everything.

774
01:42:56,291 --> 01:43:00,170
We have to make the decisions for her.
Whether she likes it or not.

775
01:43:54,516 --> 01:43:57,936
<i>I said to myself,
'Edith, it's over.'</i>

776
01:43:58,144 --> 01:44:01,481
There's someone else. You've lost him.
- Did he have an affair?

777
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:04,693
I he did have, would I be telling you?

778
01:44:05,026 --> 01:44:07,612
He left the restaurant.
I followed him.

779
01:44:07,862 --> 01:44:13,159
My Marcel walked the whole of New York
to eat with an old blind boxer...

780
01:44:13,368 --> 01:44:17,956
...whom he'd met a couple of years before.
Can you imagine that?

781
01:44:18,873 --> 01:44:24,713
Men like that are scarce.
- My Marcel...

782
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:28,466
...that's all you ever talk about.
That's the only thing that counts.

783
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:36,725
But listen, Ginou,
I'll never have him.

784
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:41,313
He'll never be mine.
He'll remain with his wife and children.

785
01:44:46,943 --> 01:44:49,321
He phones her every day.

786
01:44:50,822 --> 01:44:54,868
I pretend I don't know what's going on.
I want him to be happy.

787
01:44:57,370 --> 01:44:58,747
I'll be right back.

788
01:45:04,169 --> 01:45:06,129
<i>I could have been Edith Piaf.</i>

789
01:45:06,963 --> 01:45:09,341
There's more in life than chansons.

790
01:45:20,727 --> 01:45:24,898
<i>It's been too long, Marcel!
Call Orly. Book a flight this evening.</i>

791
01:45:25,315 --> 01:45:30,195
SUCH a long ocean sailing:
I'd never survive it.I miss you, Marcel.

792
01:45:30,737 --> 01:45:33,239
I can't bear to be apart from you.

793
01:45:34,366 --> 01:45:38,036
Perhaps I have to return to Paris.
- Hold on.

794
01:45:38,244 --> 01:45:42,123
I'm no more than Madame's lapdog.
- Stop it...

795
01:45:44,209 --> 01:45:49,506
Rum, coke! Whisky!
People think I'm rubbish.

796
01:45:50,548 --> 01:45:52,634
Getting drunk in Belleville was better.

797
01:45:55,887 --> 01:45:57,722
You abandoned me.

798
01:45:58,390 --> 01:45:59,933
That's enough, Momone!

799
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:04,104
Take her away from here.

800
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,777
I'm taking the boat.

801
01:46:11,736 --> 01:46:13,822
To your career, Edith!

802
01:46:19,327 --> 01:46:22,580
Marcel, leave tonight. For me.

803
01:47:14,591 --> 01:47:19,596
You won't be sleeping if I'm not there.
- Thank God for that, Marcel.

804
01:47:29,898 --> 01:47:33,360
I'll make you coffee.
You stay where you are.

805
01:47:39,824 --> 01:47:41,910
Let me serve you.

806
01:47:59,219 --> 01:48:01,179
What are you doing here?

807
01:48:19,239 --> 01:48:21,116
I knew you'd come.

808
01:48:23,618 --> 01:48:26,621
Lucien found it hard to get tickets.

809
01:48:32,043 --> 01:48:33,837
I've a gift for you.

810
01:48:36,965 --> 01:48:41,219
You don't look too well.
You could do with some sun. You're pale.

811
01:48:50,645 --> 01:48:51,896
Ginou!

812
01:48:53,565 --> 01:48:55,650
I'm looking for that watch!

813
01:49:02,198 --> 01:49:05,535
Wat nou?
I'm looking for that watch!

814
01:49:05,744 --> 01:49:09,998
In the red Cartier box.
Shit, it was right here!

815
01:49:19,424 --> 01:49:20,675
What's the matter with you?

816
01:49:20,842 --> 01:49:24,846
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

817
01:49:29,726 --> 01:49:34,022
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
What?

818
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:39,194
Louis? What's the matter?

819
01:49:41,613 --> 01:49:43,782
I want you to be brave, Edith.

820
01:49:45,784 --> 01:49:47,369
Is it Marcel?

821
01:49:48,912 --> 01:49:50,288
What?

822
01:49:53,083 --> 01:49:55,168
The plane crashed...

823
01:50:14,062 --> 01:50:15,397
Marcel!

824
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,068
Marcel!

825
01:51:55,997 --> 01:51:58,416
What more can I tell you?

826
01:51:59,459 --> 01:52:01,336
They say you're the best clairvoyant there is.

827
01:52:01,544 --> 01:52:06,549
This is your third visit this week.
I've told you all I know.

828
01:52:06,841 --> 01:52:08,760
Why do you keep coming back?

829
01:52:10,512 --> 01:52:13,098
So you can tell me again.

830
01:52:14,599 --> 01:52:17,686
So that I know why I should continue living.

831
01:52:19,271 --> 01:52:22,399
He died in the air, so that is where he must be...

832
01:52:34,619 --> 01:52:37,205
<i>California, August 1955</i>

833
01:52:45,547 --> 01:52:50,760
Jack Peals! Can we go any faster?
I need air.

834
01:52:50,969 --> 01:52:53,555
I love the heat.
It makes me dizzy.

835
01:52:54,514 --> 01:52:57,142
Step on it.
Our pin-up is melting!

836
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:04,107
I'm getting a sore throat.
Then you can take care of me.Like a good husband.

837
01:53:04,316 --> 01:53:08,069
The best I've had.
- The FIRST you've had!

838
01:53:09,404 --> 01:53:12,240
Are you going to spend the day gawping at up?

839
01:53:15,785 --> 01:53:17,454
I'm feeling nauseous.

840
01:53:17,871 --> 01:53:20,915
Look out, you'll drive us off the road.

841
01:53:21,833 --> 01:53:27,464
Let me drive. Stop, I'll drive.
Then Ginou can throw up.

842
01:53:32,886 --> 01:53:33,929
Go on, Ginou.

843
01:53:35,388 --> 01:53:36,932
May I, Madame?

844
01:53:39,142 --> 01:53:40,810
Go ahead, Ginou!

845
01:53:41,436 --> 01:53:43,730
Very good!

846
01:53:49,778 --> 01:53:50,820
Bye bye, Ginou!

847
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:53,531
Wait for me!

848
01:53:57,494 --> 01:53:59,037
My, you're some driver.

849
01:54:02,290 --> 01:54:07,295
Our journey hasn't been wasted after all.
We just murdered a tree.

850
01:54:15,637 --> 01:54:20,308
My God, the service here is awful.
Can nobody take our order?

851
01:54:21,559 --> 01:54:26,481
<i>Take it easy. You're no star here.
Mocambo is tonight.</i>

852
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:30,652
Remind me who invited us.

853
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:34,823
Marlon Brando, Ginger Rogers,
Mr. Chaplin...

854
01:54:38,785 --> 01:54:40,328
What's this?

855
01:54:41,997 --> 01:54:46,084
We didn't order that swill!
- That's your cocktail.

856
01:54:55,468 --> 01:54:58,805
Don't touch me!
I said don't touch me!

857
01:54:59,431 --> 01:55:01,182
Here, wipe it off.

858
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:05,895
We should get a divorce.

859
01:55:10,775 --> 01:55:14,362
How many times a day are you shooting up now?

860
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,948
About ten.

861
01:55:18,283 --> 01:55:23,955
Excuse me for being so direct,
but why do you do it?

862
01:55:27,167 --> 01:55:29,461
So that my body doesn't protest.

863
01:55:33,214 --> 01:55:37,302
When did you start injecting every day?

864
01:55:37,469 --> 01:55:40,805
Five years ago, after the plane crash.

865
01:55:41,056 --> 01:55:45,727
I contracted rheumatism.
I couldn't knit any more.

866
01:55:47,729 --> 01:55:50,649
You're very dependent on it.

867
01:55:51,566 --> 01:55:54,486
It's an addiction...
- Doctor?

868
01:55:54,986 --> 01:55:57,739
I want my wife to kick the habit.

869
01:56:00,659 --> 01:56:03,995
I want to be well again. I can do it.

870
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:13,463
October 1960 - 5 years later

871
01:56:34,526 --> 01:56:36,611
Danielle, a chair!

872
01:56:46,204 --> 01:56:47,664
Edith?

873
01:56:54,879 --> 01:56:56,423
Here you are.

874
01:56:57,382 --> 01:56:58,800
Sit down now.

875
01:57:09,561 --> 01:57:10,812
Bruno...

876
01:57:16,651 --> 01:57:19,070
<i>...there won't be another
L'Olympia.</i>

877
01:57:25,744 --> 01:57:27,287
I understand.

878
01:57:39,257 --> 01:57:40,634
No!

879
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:54,189
The composer Charles Dumont and
the lyricist Michel Vaucaire are here.

880
01:57:54,397 --> 01:57:57,609
<i>They wish us to hear their chanson.</i>

881
01:58:05,784 --> 01:58:08,161
Quickly then. I'm tired.

882
01:58:25,971 --> 01:58:30,558
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

883
01:58:32,143 --> 01:58:35,689
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

884
01:58:36,731 --> 01:58:41,319
<i>not the good times I had</i>

885
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:45,824
<i>not the pain
it means nothing to me</i>

886
01:58:45,991 --> 01:58:47,367
Stop!

887
01:58:48,618 --> 01:58:52,163
I love it. Carry on!

888
01:58:52,998 --> 01:58:55,709
<i>with my souvenirs</i>

889
01:58:56,334 --> 01:58:58,920

01:59:01,423 --> 01:59:03,842
<i>I don't need it any longer</i>

892
01:59:04,259 --> 01:59:06,678
<i>the loves are gone</i>

893
01:59:06,845 --> 01:59:09,264
<i>the traumas as well</i>

894
01:59:09,472 --> 01:59:12,183

You're wonderful!

897
01:59:16,021 --> 01:59:20,108
That's precisely what I was looking out for.
Unbelievable. This is so ME!

898
01:59:21,026 --> 01:59:23,236
That is MY life.
That is me!

899
01:59:23,528 --> 01:59:28,867
<i>Call Coquatrix. L'Olympia is on!
Play it again. It's exquisite.</i>

01:59:29,367 --> 01:59:33,121
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

901
01:59:34,497 --> 01:59:38,126
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

<i>You're doing well, my dear.
Your friend, Marguerite'</i>

903
02:00:03,485 --> 02:00:06,821
Everyone's here: Aznavour,
Mr. Cocteau, Yves Montand.

904
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:10,158
Montand's here?
I read that he wasn't coming.

905
02:00:10,367 --> 02:00:11,618
He's come for you!

906
02:00:11,826 --> 02:00:15,997
They've been waiting a half hour.
- The room is jumping.

907
02:00:28,009 --> 02:00:29,761
Not too tight?

908
02:00:32,472 --> 02:00:35,392
Who's that?
- A friend.

909
02:00:56,871 --> 02:00:59,040
Let's go, Edith.

910
02:00:59,374 --> 02:01:00,625
Up you get.

911
02:01:06,464 --> 02:01:07,799
My crucifix?

912
02:01:09,718 --> 02:01:10,635
My crucifix...

913
02:01:13,346 --> 02:01:14,472
My crucifix?

914
02:01:14,723 --> 02:01:17,809
I forgot. I'll fetch it.
- I won't sing without it.

915
02:01:18,977 --> 02:01:21,688
Everybody out!

916
02:02:32,592 --> 02:02:36,972
<i>Grasse, Oktober 1963
The Final Night</i>

917
02:02:37,305 --> 02:02:38,640
See you tomorrow.

918
02:02:38,848 --> 02:02:40,517
I'll do it.

919
02:02:45,939 --> 02:02:51,569
I'm afraid, Simone. I'm losing my memory.
It's serious this time.

920
02:02:53,029 --> 02:02:55,532
My brain is confused.

921
02:02:55,949 --> 02:03:01,579
I try to remember things but they won't come.

922
02:03:03,331 --> 02:03:07,502
Things do come, but not the things I want.

923
02:03:10,338 --> 02:03:14,718
I wanted to see his watch.
Don't you remember? Marcel's watch?

924
02:03:14,926 --> 02:03:19,931
I'm afraid not. I never knew him.
- I wanted to see his watch...

925
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:40,368
What a face!

926
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:44,039
You have wild eyes.

927
02:03:47,459 --> 02:03:49,336
I like the little one.

928
02:04:24,162 --> 02:04:27,165
Simone?
- Yes, Edith?

929
02:04:29,584 --> 02:04:31,878
I haven't said my prayers.

930
02:04:35,006 --> 02:04:37,842
I must get down on my knees and pray.

931
02:04:38,343 --> 02:04:42,722
No one will think less of you
if you don't get down on your knees.

932
02:04:43,014 --> 02:04:45,850
I wish to pray for my papa.

933
02:05:49,039 --> 02:05:50,415
Marcelle...

934
02:05:51,958 --> 02:05:53,209
Marcelle...

935
02:05:54,252 --> 02:05:56,338
...my little ghost...

936
02:05:58,423 --> 02:06:03,219
Only Momone knows.
I must tell you about my ghost.

937
02:06:03,428 --> 02:06:06,264
Take it easy, Edith.
- Marcelle!

938
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:18,860
Marcelle, go to bed. Enough for today.

939
02:06:19,069 --> 02:06:25,116
And I'm supposed to look out for the police
- and your child! What Louis up to?

940
02:06:26,451 --> 02:06:28,036
It's your father.

941
02:06:32,958 --> 02:06:34,209
Has she eaten?

942
02:06:34,501 --> 02:06:38,380
They're saying you were on the street with her.
- Who says that?

943
02:06:38,546 --> 02:06:41,800
You only have her twice a month
and you can't even do THAT right!

944
02:06:42,008 --> 02:06:43,677
I told you: not on the street!

945
02:06:53,478 --> 02:06:54,312
Come quick.

946
02:06:57,315 --> 02:06:58,066
It's Marcelle!
Come quick!

947
02:07:02,862 --> 02:07:04,406
She's in the hospital!

948
02:07:27,178 --> 02:07:29,139
Are you her mother?

949
02:07:29,681 --> 02:07:34,686
Meningitis. We could do nothing. I'm sorry.

950
02:08:09,179 --> 02:08:10,722
Edith?

951
02:08:12,223 --> 02:08:14,059
I have the crucifix.

952
02:08:32,827 --> 02:08:35,330
They told me you were on the beach.

953
02:08:36,289 --> 02:08:40,460
Thanks for agreeing to this interview.
- My pleasure.

954
02:08:41,586 --> 02:08:44,214
How strange to meet you so far from Paris.

955
02:08:44,422 --> 02:08:46,925
I'm never far from Paris.

956
02:08:47,759 --> 02:08:53,098
I have a list of question.
Just say the first thing that occurs to you.

957
02:08:59,437 --> 02:09:02,983
What is your favourite colour?
- Blue.

958
02:09:03,191 --> 02:09:07,153
Your favourite food?
- Roast beef.

959
02:09:08,822 --> 02:09:14,119
Would you like to live sensibly?
- I already do.

960
02:09:18,415 --> 02:09:23,295
<i>Who are your most loyal friends?
- All my genuine friends.</i>

961
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:28,425
<i>If you were unable to sing...</i>

962
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:32,470
<i>Then I could no longer live.</i>

963
02:09:33,555 --> 02:09:35,515
<i>Are you afraid of death?</i>

964
02:09:36,975 --> 02:09:39,477
<i>I'm more afraid of loneliness.</i>

965
02:09:41,062 --> 02:09:45,942
<i>Do you pray?
- Yes, for I believe in love.</i>

966
02:09:47,193 --> 02:09:49,279
I don't want to, Simone.

967
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:54,075
Where's Theo? I want my husband.

968
02:09:54,409 --> 02:09:56,911
Theo will be here in less than an hour.

969
02:09:57,913 --> 02:10:00,832
<i>What was the finest part of the show for you?</i>

970
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:04,002
<i>When the curtain went up.</i>

971
02:10:19,601 --> 02:10:22,020
<i>And as a woman?</i>

972
02:10:23,271 --> 02:10:25,357
<i>My first kiss.</i>

973
02:10:27,442 --> 02:10:32,113
<i>Do you like the night?
- Yes, with lots of light.</i>

974
02:10:32,364 --> 02:10:37,035
<i>The morning?
- With a piano and friends.</i>

975
02:10:37,243 --> 02:10:38,495
<i>The evening?</i>

976
02:10:38,703 --> 02:10:41,539
<i>Because that's our morning.</i>

977
02:10:47,045 --> 02:10:49,214
You see, you're breathing.

978
02:10:57,264 --> 02:10:59,224
I can't go back.

979
02:11:03,228 --> 02:11:04,980
I can't.

980
02:11:44,102 --> 02:11:47,856
<i>What advice would you give a woman?</i>

981
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:50,650
<i>Love.</i>

982
02:11:50,859 --> 02:11:53,778
<i>To a young girl?
- Love.</i>

983
02:11:53,987 --> 02:11:57,449
<i>To a child?
- Love.</i>

984
02:12:00,535 --> 02:12:02,746
Whom are you knitting for?

985
02:12:04,414 --> 02:12:07,334
For anyone who'll wear my sweaters.

986
02:12:09,002 --> 02:12:12,881
That's it. I hope it wasn't too long.

987
02:12:15,133 --> 02:12:18,720
Thank you so much, madame.
- Thank you too.

988
02:13:03,515 --> 02:13:08,436
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

989
02:13:09,062 --> 02:13:13,441
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

990
02:13:14,276 --> 02:13:19,614
<i>not the good times I had</i>

991
02:13:19,781 --> 02:13:25,453
<i>not the pain
it means nothing to me</i>

992
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:30,542
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

993
02:13:31,293 --> 02:13:35,547
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

994
02:13:36,298 --> 02:13:41,303
<i>it is done,
wiped away</i>

995
02:13:41,803 --> 02:13:49,394
<i>erased, the past
interests me not at all</i>

996
02:13:49,728 --> 02:13:52,981
<i>with my souvenirs</i>

997
02:13:53,565 --> 02:13:55,984
<i>I build a fire</i>

998
02:13:56,401 --> 02:13:59,321
<i>my sadness, my pleasure</i>

999
02:13:59,529 --> 02:14:02,324
<i>I don't need it any longer</i>

1000
02:14:02,574 --> 02:14:04,951
<i>the loves are gone</i>

1001
02:14:05,493 --> 02:14:07,996
<i>the traumas as well</i>

1002
02:14:08,288 --> 02:14:11,207
<i>erased for ever</i>

1003
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:16,212
<i>I must start anew</i>

1004
02:14:17,255 --> 02:14:23,011
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

1005
02:14:23,303 --> 02:14:27,682
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

1006
02:14:28,308 --> 02:14:33,730
<i>not the good times I had</i>

1007
02:14:33,939 --> 02:14:39,861
<i>not the pain
it means nothing to me</i>

1008
02:14:40,111 --> 02:14:45,116
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

1009
02:14:45,283 --> 02:14:49,704
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

1010
02:14:50,538 --> 02:14:52,707
<i>because my life</i>

1011
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:55,961
<i>and my joy</i>

1012
02:14:56,127 --> 02:14:58,964
<i>today</i>

1013
02:14:59,589 --> 02:15:07,931
<i>begins with you.</i>

1014
02:15:11,559 --> 02:15:14,729
<i>Edith Piaf died on 9 October 1963.
She was only forty-seven...</i>
