1
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,540
<i>Buenos Aires is growing
uncontrollably and imperfectly.</i>

2
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,948
<i>An overpopulated city
in a deserted country.</i>

3
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:42,210
<i>A city in which thousands
of buildings rise into the sky.</i>

4
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,316
<i>Arbitrarily.</i>

5
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,265
<i>Next to a tall one, a small one.</i>

6
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>Next to a rational one,
an irrational one.</i>

7
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:09,206
<i>Next to a French one,
one with no style at all.</i>

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,979
<i>These irregularities
probably reflect us perfectly.</i>

9
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,712
Aesthetic and ethical
irregularities.

10
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,036
<i>These buildings,
which adhere to no logic,</i>

11
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:35,037
<i>represent bad planning.</i>

12
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,507
<i>Just like our lives:</i>

13
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:45,547
<i>We have no idea how
we want them to be.</i>

14
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:52,188
<i>We live as if Buenos Aires
were a stopover.</i>

15
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,819
<i>We've created
a "culture of tenants".</i>

16
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:25,722
<i>The buildings are becoming smaller
to make space for even smaller ones.</i>

17
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,521
<i>Apartments are measured
by their number of rooms</i>

18
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,857
<i>and range from five rooms
with balconies,</i>

19
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,527
<i>playrooms, servants' quarters
and storerooms</i>

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,533
<i>to one-room apartments
also known as "shoeboxes".</i>

21
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,347
<i>Just like almost
all man-made objects,</i>

22
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,153
buildings are made
to differentiate between us.

23
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,894
<i>There's a front and a back side.
High and low apartments.</i>

24
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:14,872
<i>Privileged people have the letter A
or sometimes B.</i>

25
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:19,008
<i>The farther back in the alphabet,
the worse the apartment.</i>

26
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,540
<i>The promised view and brightness
rarely coincide with reality.</i>

27
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,721
What can be expected of <i>a</i> city
that turns its back on its river?

28
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,117
<i>I'm convinced that separations,
divorces</i>

29
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,420
domestic violence,
the excess of cable <i>TV</i> stations,

30
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,932
<i>the lack of communication,
listlessness,</i>

31
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,199
<i>apathy, depression, suicide,</i>

32
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,967
<i>neuroses, panic attacks,</i>

33
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,838
obesity, tenseness,

34
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,479
<i>insecurity, hypochondria,</i>

35
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,446
<i>stress and a sedentary lifestyle</i>

36
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,918
<i>are attributable to architects
and builders.</i>

37
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,889
<i>I suffer from all of these illnesses
except suicide.</i>

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,470
<i>This is my one-room apartment.
400 square feet</i>

39
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,016
<i>and one miserable window
for one breathless lung.</i>

40
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,711
<i>Santa Fé, 1105.</i>

41
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,619
<i>Fourth ?oor. H.</i>

42
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,794
<i>I sat down at my computer
ten years ago</i>

43
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:53,062
<i>and feel like
I've never got up again.</i>

44
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,670
<i>I don't know if the Internet is
the future, but it was mine:</i>

45
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,300
<i>I design websites
and this is my cyberspace</i>

46
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,640
<i>I don't know if I'm good
or just got into it early,</i>

47
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,146
<i>but I'm very busy.</i>

48
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,717
<i>I began with my psychiatrist’s
website for phobics:</i>

49
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,845
<i>His specialty and the reason
why I visit him twice a week.</i>

50
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,965
<i>This game is a hit.</i>

51
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:26,230
<i>It's for insomniacs
fighting pill addiction.</i>

52
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,303
<i>My psychiatrist calls me
a phobic on my way to recovery.</i>

53
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,075
<i>Due to repeated, violent panic attacks,
I locked myself in my apartment</i>

54
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,645
<i>for years.</i>

55
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,985
<i>I won 17 championships
at expert level.</i>

56
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,090
<i>Four times undefeated,
nine times top scorer.</i>

57
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,293
<i>I beat Federer four times
at Wimbledon.</i>

58
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,659
<i>I became Godfather
of the Corleone family</i>

59
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,562
<i>I was totally isolated. Scared.</i>

60
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,863
<i>My psychiatrist developed
a strategy to help me overcome</i>

61
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,769
<i>my fear of the city:
Photography.</i>

62
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,876
<i>A way to rediscover
the city and people.</i>

63
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,942
<i>A search for beauty where
it's not apparent.</i>

64
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,608
<i>Observing is being and not being.</i>

65
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,620
<i>Or being in another way.</i>

66
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,120
<i>I distracted myself.</i>

67
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,996
<i>I don't take the bus or taxis.
Much less the subway,</i>

68
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,067
<i>and I'd never take a plane.
I only go by foot</i>

69
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,262
<i>and always have
my survival backpack.</i>

70
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,342
<i>Contents: a Leica D-Lux 3
with 10 mega pixels.</i>

71
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:42,344
<i>Rivotril drops, 2.5 mg.
Amoxicillin 500.</i>

72
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,507
<i>Ibuprofen. Sunglasses.
A plastic rain coat.</i>

73
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,142
<i>A Victorinox with 21 tools.</i>

74
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:53,757
<i>Flashlight with batteries.
Condoms, three units.</i>

75
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,590
<i>400 pesos cash in small bills.
An iPod with 60 GB</i>

76
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,096
<i>and more than 8,000 songs.</i>

77
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,758
<i>Three Tati films. A notebook.
And a plastic card</i>

78
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,202
about how to proceed
<i>in</i> case of an accident

79
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,499
<i>or panic attack.</i>

80
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:22,085
<i>The backpack weighs 5.8 kG.
7 % of my body weight.</i>

81
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,492
<i>I've been an architect for two years,
but still haven't built anything.</i>

82
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,197
<i>Neither a building, nor a house,
nor a bathroom. Nothing.</i>

83
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,639
<i>Only models that are uninhabitable,
and not only because of their scale...</i>

84
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,181
<i>I didn't fare well
with other constructions either:</i>

85
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,408
<i>My four-year relationship collapsed</i>

86
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,315
<i>despite my ef fons to shore it up.</i>

87
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,650
<i>If my life were a game of life,</i>

88
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:04,192
<i>I'd have to move back five spaces.</i>

89
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,425
<i>That's why I'm here:</i>

90
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,726
<i>With my disorderly life in 27 boxes,</i>

91
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,895
<i>I sit on twelve meters
of bubble wrap, popping bubbles</i>

92
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,666
<i>so that I myself don't pop.</i>

93
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,013
<i>This is my new old shoebox</i>

94
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,819
<i>that these ridiculous five steps
make into a "duplex".</i>

95
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,460
<i>And this is the freakish thing,
half window, half balcony,</i>

96
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,227
<i>that the sun shuns all year long.</i>

97
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,838
<i>Avenida Santa Fe, 1183.
Eighth floor.</i> G

98
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,339
<i>as in gastritis.</i>

99
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,979
<i>This is my favourite building
in Buenos Aires.</i>

100
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,211
<i>It's the best location
and the most fun.</i>

101
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,282
<i>It's built with
my favourite materials:</i>

102
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,086
Concrete, steel and glass.

103
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:13,491
<i>One of the world's few buildings</i>

104
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,099
<i>with an equilateral
triangular base,</i>

105
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,362
<i>it was inspired
by Saturn and its rings.</i>

106
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,798
<i>Even if most people
see a flying saucer.</i>

107
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:28,439
<i>I enter it expecting
to take off and leave this world.</i>

108
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,781
<i>But in reality,
the planetarium puts me in my place,</i>

109
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,222
<i>reminding me that
the world doesn't revolve around me.</i>

110
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,625
<i>I'm a very small
pan of a planet</i>

111
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,359
<i>that's pan of a system
that's pan of a galaxy</i>

112
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:55,163
<i>that, like hundreds of thousands
of galaxies, forms pan of the universe.</i>

113
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:01,935
<i>It reminds me that I'm pan of
an infinite and eternal whole.</i>

114
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:07,007
A SHORT AUTUMN

115
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,948
The dog committed suicide.

116
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:17,446
Apparently it was a 40-year-old
prostitute's only companion

117
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:22,954
and was locked out on the balcony
so it wouldn't bother her customers.

118
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,355
The dog went mad when
they touched her.

119
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,301
No wonder it jumped

120
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,798
Alone, on such a small balcony.

121
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,910
STRANGE ACCIDENT
IN BUENOS AIRES:

122
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,140
A DEAD DOG
AND TWO INJURED PEOPLE

123
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,679
Sig nature.

124
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,519
Thanks.

125
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,422
DISC ARTHROSIS

126
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:58,297
You look terrible,
but you're perfectly healthy.

127
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:03,545
The only strange things are the fifth and sixth
vertebrae, which you've had since birth.

128
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:09,984
Otherwise, you'd be screaming
in pain, so it's not that.

129
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,413
Are you dizzy? No.

130
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:18,553
Just do some fitness training
and lighten up your backpack.

131
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,789
There's nothing serious,
nothing at all.

132
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,158
You see...

133
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,402
Those reports are written by kids

134
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,773
in laboratories or hospitals
who write

135
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,107
down everything to protect
themselves.

136
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,843
They're not perfect.
What can you do?

137
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,315
If you want to worry, go ahead,
but not about that.

138
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,711
You're the same.

139
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,361
<i>Until I can work as an architect,
I'm designing shop windows.</i>

140
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,594
<i>It distracts me
from other thoughts.</i>

141
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,408
<i>I think of the windows
as lost places.</i>

142
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,569
<i>They're neither inside
nor outside.</i>

143
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,342
<i>An abstract and magic space.</i>

144
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,973
<i>They reflect a pan of me.</i>

145
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,747
<i>At the same time,
the anonymity calms me.</i>

146
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,214
<i>Maybe it's stupid, burl think:</i>

147
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,485
<i>If someone stops to look,</i>

148
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,425
<i>they're somehow interested in me.</i>

149
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,631
<i>I've had this book since I was 14.</i>

150
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,399
<i>And forgive me, great writers,</i>

151
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,066
<i>but it's a key book in my life.</i>

152
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,107
<i>It's the origin of
my fear of crowds,</i>

153
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,875
<i>which has become existential.</i>

154
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,077
<i>It dramatically represents</i>

155
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,953
<i>the fear of knowing
I'm one lost person among millions.</i>

156
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:06,326
<i>Years have passed and I still can't
solve one of the puzzles:</i>

157
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,759
<i>"Wally in the City".</i>

158
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:13,199
<i>I found him shopping,
at the airport and the beach,</i>

159
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,828
but not in the city.

160
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,703
<i>Perhaps my nerves
have blinded me.</i>

161
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,404
<i>So I'm wondering:</i>

162
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:26,641
<i>If I can't find a person
when I know who I'm looking for,</i>

163
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,845
<i>how can I find a person when
I don't know who I'm looking for?</i>

164
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:36,154
"Hi, I'm Susú,
part stuffed animal and part dog."

165
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,784
<i>Seven years ago, my girlfriend
visited her parents</i>

166
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:44,128
<i>in New Jersey, USA.
She wanted to stay for a few weeks.</i>

167
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,768
<i>As painful as it was for her,
she called me collect to say</i>

168
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,134
<i>she wasn't coming back.</i>

169
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,072
<i>It was her new home and she'd
realised she was very American.</i>

170
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,979
<i>Ingenious! She felt very American
when Argentina was devalued.</i>

171
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:05,248
<i>The truth is, there wasn't much
to keep her here: me and her dog.</i>

172
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,857
<i>She left her with the best
of intentions too.</i>

173
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,791
<i>She claimed the change in language</i>

174
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,861
<i>would be too difficult for her.</i>

175
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,079
You know planes make me nervous.

176
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,116
Please take the rock I travel with.

177
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:38,085
- You've only travelled once.
- Well, it worked.

178
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:42,515
It's my kabbalah. Do it for me.

179
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,326
Alright.

180
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:00,275
<i>AH at once,
I lost the woman I loved</i>

181
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,945
<i>and my ability to fly.</i>

182
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:43,777
<i>Hello, this is Mariana.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

183
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,686
<i>Hello, hello. Are you there?</i>

184
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:59,301
<i>Alright. I just wanted
to tell you that tonight</i>

185
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,205
<i>a great film will be on TV</i>

186
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,872
<i>with Bill Murray
and the groundhog.</i>

187
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:11,705
<i>And because you took the TV,
I thought we could watch it together.</i>

188
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,618
<i>Pick up. I know you're there.</i>

189
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,826
<i>Are you with a guy?
You screwed me!</i>

190
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,694
<i>How can you be close
to someone so different?</i>

191
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:35,103
<i>That's the stupid conclusion
after a four-year relationship.</i>

192
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,635
<i>Four years are 48 months.</i>

193
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,972
<i>1460 days.</i>

194
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,717
<i>35,040 hours
with the wrong person.</i>

195
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:56,149
<i>I watched him one night
and realised everything:</i>

196
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,724
<i>For the first time, he was distant,</i>

197
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,458
<i>as if he were completely unfamiliar.</i>

198
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:08,066
<i>I suddenly feared
being alone with a stranger.</i>

199
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,875
<i>And here I am:</i>

200
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,707
In the same apartment
that I abandoned to live with him.

201
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:21,713
<i>In front of the same mirror.
Four years later.</i>

202
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:13,561
A LONG WINTER

203
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,674
Thanks.

204
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,493
<i>The Internet brings me closer to
the world, but further from life.</i>

205
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,626
<i>I do banking and read magazines
on the Internet,</i>

206
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,362
<i>download music and listen to
the radio on the Internet,</i>

207
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:00,368
<i>order food on the Internet,
watch films on the Internet,</i>

208
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,012
<i>chat on the Internet,
study on the Internet,</i>

209
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:08,377
<i>play on the Internet, have sex
on the Internet and search for...</i>

210
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,884
DOG SITTER

211
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,520
Come here, Susú.

212
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,663
Come here, Susú. Come.

213
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,939
- This is Susú.
- Alright.

214
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,479
She's not used to
being with other animals.

215
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:45,816
- Then you'd better come with us.
- Alright, I'll take her.

216
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,399
- Can you get me a fag from my pocket?
- Here?

217
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,345
- Got a light?
- No.

218
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,877
- Get it from my pocket.
- Here?

219
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,879
- How long?
- Are you gay?

220
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,761
- Because of the dog
- Oh, right.

221
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:42,737
It's not mine. It belongs to a friend
who went to the USA.

222
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,499
She asked me to take care of it.

223
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,303
She had a problem
and couldn't come back,

224
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,537
sol kept it.

225
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:54,446
And since she left,
it's... it's more depressed,

226
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:58,076
it doesn't bark, it's insecure

227
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,018
and doesn't want to leave the house.
So I thought it'd be good

228
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,890
for it to meet other dogs and people.

229
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,896
I think she's adapting.
What do you think?

230
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,195
I thought you were gay.

231
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,051
I can't concentrate.

232
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,592
Maybe another time

233
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,737
Alright.

234
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,330
- Alright, bye.
- And what do we do? Should I call you?

235
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:56,241
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- Alright. Everything okay?

236
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,314
More or less. Bye.

237
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,193
Want to eat dinner?
Or should I wait until spring?

238
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,963
- Now?
- Do you have time?

239
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:26,305
I wanted to start swimming.
I'm tense.

240
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:31,676
- It's not time to start swimming.
- No, it's never time to swim.

241
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,407
Then let's eat.

242
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,085
Here it is.

243
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,152
Have you been here?

244
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,723
I've seen the building
but didn't know it has a restaurant.

245
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,292
I thought they were offices.

246
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,633
I thought it might be interesting
for an architect.

247
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,078
Shall we go up?

248
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,120
I'll take the stairs.

249
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,455
It's on the 20th floor.

250
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,624
Well...

251
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,265
You'll probably think I'm crazy,
but...

252
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:31,338
I have a phobia of them.
I don't use lifts.

253
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,940
Especially when
they're hermetically sealed.

254
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,444
I get claustrophobia.

255
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,507
Do you live on the ground floor?

256
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,483
- On the eighth.
- Seriously?

257
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,914
I think twice before leaving
the flat.

258
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,284
I go up at least three times a day.

259
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,623
Want to try it with me?

260
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,424
What?

261
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,398
No, I mean take the lift.

262
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,235
I know a good
ground floor restaurant

263
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:13,172
I'm curious to see the city
from so high up.

264
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,713
I'll Walk.

265
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,352
- I'll join you.
- That's not necessary. Really

266
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,723
You wouldn't make it anyway.

267
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,456
- Of course I will.
- But...

268
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,500
Now that you've finally said "yes'"

269
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,233
When did you last use a lift?

270
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,202
- Two or three years ago.
- Did something bad happen?

271
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,279
Don't speak.
You'll be out of breath.

272
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,141
Administer it.

273
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:53,115
- Have you tried closing your eyes?
- If that would only work.

274
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,860
The last time I climbed so many steps
was at Teotihuacan's Pyramid

275
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,498
of the Sun. 40 degrees

276
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:07,000
and not one miserable cloud
in the middle of the desert.

277
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,900
And 260 awkward steps.

278
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,675
They say the top of the pyramid
is a point

279
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:18,280
of cosmic energy
that fulfils your wishes.

280
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,784
My wish was not to fall
on my way back down.

281
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:27,515
Some people go back down on
their arses so they don't fall.

282
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,158
That's typical of religions:
They promise the improbable

283
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,456
so you don't regret
the sacrifices they demand.

284
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,296
I hope I won't regret
climbing these stairs.

285
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,437
Everything alright?

286
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,788
Don't you want to take the lift?

287
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:05,759
- Yes. That'd be better.
- See you at the top.

288
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,488
Smoking is killing me.

289
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,764
- Should I order a water for you?
- Go ahead.

290
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,360
- Sparkling or still?
- Still!

291
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:05,796
<i>My relationship with Pablo
corresponded with the digital age.</i>

292
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,170
<i>At the beginning,</i>

293
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,507
I bought a camera
that documented those four years.

294
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,348
<i>380 photographs the first year.</i>

295
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,680
<i>176 in the second.
97 in the third.</i>

296
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,516
<i>And four in the last year.</i>

297
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,227
<i>In a simple, irreversible act,</i>

298
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:34,325
<i>I'm doing away
with 38.9 megabytes of history.</i>

299
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,573
<i>If only my head worked as well
as my Mac</i>

300
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,678
<i>and I could forget everything
with a click.</i>

301
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:51,914
<i>Is there anything more discouraging
in the 21st century as an empty in-box?</i>

302
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,519
<i>Luckily, a friend wrote to me
from Oman.</i>

303
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,786
<i>He happens to be visiting Yemen</i>

304
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:03,160
<i>and needs my help withdrawing
9.5 million dollars</i>

305
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:07,030
<i>from a local bank.
He hasn't written for a while.</i>

306
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,105
<i>It's an imprudent,
one-sided friendship.</i>

307
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,705
Please give us some space.

308
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,260
<i>Before I had my lift phobia,</i>

309
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,168
<i>I gave tours
in the Kavanagh building.</i>

310
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,110
<i>I had no problem taking
the 15 lifts</i>

311
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:52,112
<i>through 31 floors of
the city's most beautiful skyscraper:</i>

312
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:56,810
<i>The world's largest concrete
construction at the end of the 1930s.</i>

313
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:01,287
<i>A building as striking
as the history that it conceals.</i>

314
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,983
<i>Corina Kavanagh
was a beautiful woman</i>

315
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,188
<i>from a wealthy,
but plebeian family</i>

316
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,960
<i>who fell in love
with a young man of nobility.</i>

317
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:16,333
<i>The Anchorenas opposed
the relationship and broke it up.</i>

318
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,337
<i>Their most important possession</i>

319
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,033
<i>was the Basilica
Santisimo Sacramento,</i>

320
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:25,747
<i>a temple they built
which later became the family tomb.</i>

321
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,775
<i>The Anchorenas' palace
was on the other side of the park</i>

322
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:34,378
<i>and they wanted a new one
next to the basilica.</i>

323
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,717
<i>Corina Kavanagh sold three farms</i>

324
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:40,818
<i>and had a skyscraper built
for one reason:</i>

325
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,988
<i>To hide the basilica's facade</i>

326
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,761
<i>and prevent the Anchorenas
from seeing it.</i>

327
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:50,429
<i>It's only visible
from "Corina Kavanagh" alley.</i>

328
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,304
<i>When I have a daughter,
I'll name her Corina.</i>

329
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,625
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

330
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,320
Great, thanks. Here!

331
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,767
WHERE ARE YOU?

332
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,150
I'M AT THE CINEMA

333
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:35,961
- Can I put some music on?
- Of course.

334
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:45,403
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME.
WHAT MOVIE?

335
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,551
You have thousands.
How am I supposed to choose?

336
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:03,431
- I don't like them.
- Let me choose one.

337
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:27,014
I WANT TO SEE YOU.
WILL MEET YOU AT THE EXIT.

338
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,631
IT'S TERRIBLY LONG.
I'M TURNING MY MOBILE OFF.

339
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,562
SENDING TO MARIELA

340
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,802
- You hardly ate anything.
- I don't eat much in the evening.

341
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:08,053
Did I tell you I'm writing a play?

342
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,631
You've hardly said anything all night.

343
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,269
Really? I'm in a weird mood,
I don't know why.

344
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,339
I didn't know you write

345
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,208
Me neither.

346
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,749
Until now.

347
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,407
I've studied theatre for a while.

348
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,950
Should I tell you about it?

349
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,827
It's called "Cruel Woman".

350
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,664
There's a swing on stage,

351
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,165
the protagonist
and seven Dalmatians.

352
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:51,931
So the audience listens to
a monologue with headphones,

353
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:55,703
and what they hear are
her thoughts.

354
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,909
She's planning

355
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:01,811
to kill the dogs' owners
so she can keep them for herself.

356
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,554
You like it?

357
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,227
It sounds good.
I'd have to read it.

358
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,256
I act in it.

359
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,232
You're the one who
walks the drugs?

360
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,668
- "Walks the drugs"?
- Did I say "drugs"?

361
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,669
Good one!

362
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,094
11 MESSAGES

363
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,466
I'M GOING HOME.

364
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:19,418
Don't get any false hopes.
It was just sex.

365
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:49,313
<i>They sprout out of the cement,
growing where they shouldn't.</i>

366
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,585
<i>Rising up patiently
with exemplary will and dignity.</i>

367
00:46:55,445 --> 00:47:00,155
<i>Without lineage,
wild, unclassifiable by botanists.</i>

368
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,229
<i>A strange, rampant,
absurd beauty.</i>

369
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,198
<i>They adorn the greyest of corners,</i>

370
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:10,537
<i>don't own anything
and nothing can stop them.</i>

371
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,235
<i>A metaphor for uncontrollable life</i>

372
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,970
<i>that paradoxically forces me
to face my weakness.</i>

373
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:15,422
<i>I'm Marcella, a psychologist,
and my job is my passion.</i>

374
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,390
<i>Calm down, I won't analyze you.</i>

375
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:23,191
<i>As a rule,
I don't analyze friends.</i>

376
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,858
<i>To be honest, I'm very selective
regarding friendships.</i>

377
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,995
<i>I write a lot
and love self-help books.</i>

378

<i>Gender: female. Age: 31.</i>

383
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,454
<i>and a bit of Russian.</i>

384
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:55,285
<i>Hobbies: alternative music,
jazz, blues, Latin American,</i>

385

393
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,390
<i>feng shui, astrology, New Age.</i>

394
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:46,238
No, I'll listen, but I don't speak it.
I understand everything, but...

395
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:48,038
I don't speak it.

396
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:58,523
No, seriously, I speak it poorly.
I don't like hearing myself.

397
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,522
I have no control.

398
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,527
I say what I can instead of what
I want to.

399
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,602
Well, you speak it.

400
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,743
Your French sounds French.

401
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,913
<i>These dates are like
McDonalds combos.</i>

402
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:35,692
<i>They look larger and more delicious
in the photographs.</i>

403
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,960
<i>Every time I go on a date,</i>

404
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,798
<i>I suffer from the same deception
as with a Big Mac.</i>

405
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,288
No, nothing at all.

406
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,505
No more, thank you.

407
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:29,715
What were you doing alone in Paris?

408
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,677
Oh no, that's a long story.

409
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,890
But I can tell you how it ends.

410
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,050
We separated at De Gaulle.

411
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:43,392
Yes, a 13-hour flight
is too much for a couple in crisis

412
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,296
Luckily, we both had
our own luggage.

413
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:50,530
We divided up our goods
in the airport.

414
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:54,172
He kept the shampoo,
I kept the conditioner...

415
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:57,811
We split up the few things
we had in common.

416
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,871
He went to Berlin,
I stayed in Paris.

417
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:06,481
I cried for 24 hours
and that was it.

418
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,187
Everything alright?

419
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,629
Should I buy you a water?

420
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,230
Nervous ness.

421
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,798
I'm nervous.

422
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,801
I need movement.

423
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,106
Want to dance?

424
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:35,873
I have a great need to communicate.

425
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:41,081
For example,
if we'd met here by chance

426
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:44,556
and you only spoke Italian...

427
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:49,357
But let's say
I didn't understand it.

428
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:54,201
I would have lost the opportunity
to meet a very beautiful person.

429
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,635
What did you say?

430
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,802
Look it up.

431
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,348
Bloody bastard!

432
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,184
How can you be so stupid?

433
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:50,987
Bye, Susú. Come here,
I'm late. Bye.

434
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:04,496
<i>This is the 15th time
I've signed up for swimming</i>

435
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:07,575
<i>and the 15th time I won't go.</i>

436
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:12,177
<i>I love swimming, but I hate
everything before and after it.</i>

437
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,941
<i>I hate showering before
and after.</i>

438
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,915
<i>I hate getting undressed
and dressed,</i>

439
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,679
<i>drying my hair in the winter,</i>

440
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,221
<i>a wet towel in my bag,</i>

441
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,383
<i>a wet swimsuit, wet flip-flops...</i>

442
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:27,820
<i>I hate the smell of chlorine.</i>

443
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:31,194
<i>I hate the membership card
and the medical examination:</i>

444
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:36,464
<i>Having to show someone
what's between my toes.</i>

445
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,504
<i>I hate that people
piss in the water.</i>

446
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:44,010
<i>I hate caps and the amazed
expression goggles give you.</i>

447
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:49,817
<i>And what I hate most is the fact that
it's the most complete sport there is.</i>

448
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:12,037
Tired?

449
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,603
Are you tired?

450
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:22,915
You have to kick less.

451
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,584
Legs consume more oxygen
than arms.

452
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:30,021
Kicking is more for stabilization
than for propulsion.

453
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,922
Stretch out and relax your legs.

454
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,629
When your hand goes
into the water,

455
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:39,632
stretch it out, feel the impulse
and the other arm follows.

456
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,899
Your hands under your body.

457
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:45,973
And lower your head. The water
should be up to your forehead.

458
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,204
You're doing 32 strokes.
Try what I'm saying.

459
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,972
You'll do fewer strokes
and tire less.

460
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,173
You'll swim in a more relaxed way.

461
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:58,946
And try breathing every third stroke.
Go ahead, I'll count.

462
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,859
- May I?
- Yes.

463
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,726
- And?
- You were right, I'm not as tired.

464
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,325
30 strokes. Two fewer per lap
and you can get even lower.

465
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:53,202
- Are you a teacher?
- I'm a compulsive swimmer.

466
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,503
I can't sleep if
I don't swim an hour a day.

467
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,477
Really? Exhaustion from swimming
is unrivalled.

468
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,207
Yes, nothing else tires me out.

469
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,313
- What's your name?
- Rafa. And you?

470
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,548
Mariana.

471
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,549
What's it, asshole?

472
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,992
- Let me past!
- Go ahead!

473
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,122
- You're a clown!
- What the hell are you doing?

474
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,228
Idiot!

475
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,371
Always the same! Screw you!

476
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:26,440
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

477
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:31,943
I still have 30 laps!
I'm a member and I paid my fee!

478
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:37,982
- This is supposed to relax you.
- Living healthily is stressful.

479
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:43,422
Being conscious of everything
only to live a bit longer

480
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:46,049
is the worst thing we can do.

481
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:51,624
None of us come here for fun
We come to count laps.

482
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:56,694
- Why can't you sleep?
- I thought you'd know already.

483
00:59:56,826 --> 01:00:00,364
There's no switch
to turn off my head.

484
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:03,569
- Have you seen a psychologist?
- Yes, I am a psychologist.

485
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,681
So swimming is the only thing
that works?

486
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:12,048
If I could,
I'd swim to my bedside.

487
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,288
'28! .very good!

488
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,068
Tomorrow I can't swim

489
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:32,705
I've got patients until 10 p.m.,
so I won't be able to sleep.

490
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,674
We could go and eat
or drink something.

491
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:41,672
- Shalli put you to sleep?
- On the contrary.

492
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,944
What a relief. Then yes.

493
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:50,449
Let's take off our caps and goggles
so we'll recognise each other.

494
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,651
No, I'll come like this.

495
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,914
It doesn't matter, I don't care.

496
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,747
Everything's alright.

497
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,736
<i>The brilliant morning light</i>

498
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:11,778
<i>let me see the reflection clearly.</i>

499
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:19,384
<i>Late, as always,
I realised it was me in the window.</i>

500
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:21,317
<i>Like a mannequin.</i>

501
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:25,551
<i>Motionless, silent and cold.</i>

502
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:40,703
SPRING AT LAST

503
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:55,723
Absolutely all of the buildings
have <i>a</i> useless, purposeless side.

504
01:06:56,312 --> 01:07:01,386
<i>It's neither the front nor the back:</i>

505
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,129
<i>The ”medianera” or "side wall“.</i>

506
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:07,064
<i>Enormous surfaces that divide us,
reminding us of passing time,</i>

507
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,191
<i>smog and filth.</i>

508
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,779
<i>”Medianeras”
show our worst attributes.</i>

509
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:24,180
They reflect inconstancy, cracks,

510
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:26,851
<i>provisional solutions,</i>

511
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:30,048
<i>and the dirt we sweep under
the carpet.</i>

512
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:33,159
We only remember
them <i>in</i> exceptional cases

513
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,894
<i>when, during bad weather,</i>

514
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,622
<i>its ads filter through.</i>

515
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:43,335
<i>”Medianeras” have changed
into another medium for ads</i>

516
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,599
<i>that are seldom beautiful.</i>

517
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:51,302
<i>Generally,
they indicate how far we are</i>

518
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:55,314
<i>from supermarkets and fast food.</i>

519
01:07:55,805 --> 01:08:00,083
<i>Lottery ads that promise a lot
for little.</i>

520
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,685
AVAILABLE

521
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:10,889
<i>Recently, they've reminded us of
the economic crisis that left us</i>

522
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,358
<i>unemployed.</i>

523
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:18,266
<i>There's one way out of the oppression
that results from living in a shoebox.</i>

524
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,197
<i>An escape route:</i>

525
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:24,241
<i>Illegal, like all escape routes.</i>

526
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:29,649
<i>In clear violation
of urban planning norms,</i>

527
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:34,312
<i>there are a few tiny,
irregular, irresponsible windows</i>

528
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:37,424
<i>that let a few miraculous
rays of light</i>

529
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:40,220
<i>into our darkness.</i>

530
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,050
May I?

531
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,654
<i>When will we be a wireless city?</i>

532
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:47,697
<i>What geniuses blocked the river
with buildings and the sky with wires?</i>

533
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:52,972
<i>Are all those kilometers
of wire there to unite us</i>

534
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:57,369
<i>or to divide us?
Everyone in his own place.</i>

535
01:13:57,499 --> 01:14:02,312
<i>Cellular telephony invaded the world
promising to always keep us connected.</i>

536
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:04,840
<i>Text messaging:</i>

537
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,817
<i>A new ten-key system</i>

538
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,446
<i>that reduces one of the most
beautiful languages</i>

539
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:14,425
<i>to a primitive,
limited and guttural vocabulary.</i>

540
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:18,760
<i>The future is in fibre optics,
say the visionaries.</i>

541
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:24,269
<i>They've announced that we'll be able
to heat our homes from our workplaces.</i>

542
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:29,069
<i>Right! And no one will be waiting
for us when we get home.</i>

543
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,842
<i>Welcome to the era
of virtual relationships.</i>

544
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:39,444
Is this your first time chatting?

545
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,615
Yes. Did you notice?

546
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,923
Very much so.
You have to begin with M or W.

547
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:50,720
What's that?

548
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:55,731
Man or woman

549
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:59,337
Woman. A broad term, isn't it?

550
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:02,973
- And you?
- Man.

551
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:08,613
- Do I have to believe you?
- It's easy to verify.

552
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:12,207
I write like a man,
think like a man,

553
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:14,647
and act like a man.

554
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,355
And?

555
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,520
What?

556
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:28,062
Your turn. In the arse

557
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,599
I don't know what to say.

558
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:37,106
It's strange talking to someone
I don't know.

559
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:40,640
What do you want to know?

560
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,408
I don't even know where to begin

561
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:48,451
I'm taking off. Bye.

562
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:52,890
Don't leave! Wait!
Are you still there?

563
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,768
I'll give you a list of questions:

564
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,838
How old are you?
What sign are you?

565
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:08,668
What music do you listen to?
Do you believe in God?

566
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,909
What did you do today?

567
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,710
That's cheating.

568
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,317
It's a question.

569
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:26,558
Okay. I woke up at twelve
because I went to bed at five.

570
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,720
I should start swimming.
I ate breakfast at one.

571
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,898
I took an ibuprofen.

572
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:35,328
At two I started work.
I do web design.

573
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:39,195
At five I ate lunch.
At eight I went to therapy.

574
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,405
I took my second ibuprofen.

575
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,669
Then the telephone rang,
which made me happy.

576
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:46,938
Wrong number.
Now I'm eating dinner.

577
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:50,116
After chatting, I'll whack myself on
the head so I can fall asleep

578
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,309
and start swimming tomorrow.

579
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,688
DID YOU TAKE OFF?

580
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,690
YES!

581
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:09,529
Good. What did you do today?

582
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:14,999
Adaptation.
Getting used to being single again.

583
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:21,380
I'm an expert.
I could write a book.

584
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:24,074
I'm a kind of depressed
Paulo Coelho.

585
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,012
I didn't have a good day.

586
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,187
I'M SO SAD.

587
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:36,525
I have a method.
Absolutely involuntary.

588
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:41,096
A kind of Buddhist gene that makes
my happy days not so happy

589
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:43,294
and my sad days not so sad.

590
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,669
A spiritual thermostat.

591
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:59,313
And if it fails?

592
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,545
I down a Rivotril.

593
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,121
I didn't think I'd laugh today.

594
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:13,891
In return, do me a favour.
When do you wake up?

595
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:18,469
Nine.

596
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:22,474
I'll give you my number. Call me
at nine and motivate me to swim.

597
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,370
Why not now?

598
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:29,509
No, that won't do. It's a deal.

599
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:33,653
Give me your number.

600
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:46,160
Bloody bastard! Fucking hell!

601
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:57,907
Bloody bastard!

602
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:08,215
Why do I keep all this shit?

603
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:12,347
Wait Susú, I'll be right back.

604
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:34,141
- Do you have any candles?
- Yes, wait a minute...

605
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:36,441
I'll be right with you.

606
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,956
Four pesos.

607
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:54,222
- Any candles left?
- I think so. Let me look...

608
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:08,204
- I got a shock.
- Yeah, me too.

609
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:12,949
- Probably the flashlight.
- I don't know, but it was heavy.

610
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:26,456
Here they are, the last ones.
Your lucky day!

611
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:29,000
