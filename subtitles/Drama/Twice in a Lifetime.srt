1
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,627
Calling Cape Com. Cape Com?

2
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,587
This is Jupiter 16.

3
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,756
Can you give a go for fourth orbit?

4
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,716
Cape Com to Jupiter 16.

5
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,594
Can you confirm 02 pressure
is within limit?

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,473
Roger. It all looks good
in the environmental control system.

7
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,268
OK. Everything looks good from here.

8
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,854
You have a go for fourth orbit.

9
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,022
Jupiter 16. Roger.

10
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,693
You're stowing all loose gear.
Ready for the EVA.

11
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,361
Jupiter 16, this is Cape Com.

12
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,321
Start your EVA when you're ready.

13
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,199
You have time in the other EVAs
for experiments.

14
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,368
So don't stay out too long, Chris.

15
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,703
OK, flight.

16
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,956
- Don't worry. We'll stick to plan.
- Roger.

17
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:25,669
Cape Com to Jupiter 16. On my mark
it will be four plus three seven.

18
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,714
Four, three, two

19
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,049
one, mark.

20
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,683
Cape Com, this is Chris.

21
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,727
I'm out.

22
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,937
Everything looks OK.

23
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,397
Good.

24
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,900
The manoeuvring unit works this time.

25
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,569
I used it to get out.
It makes things a lot easier.

26
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,780
Cape Com to Hawaii,
this is flight control, come in.

27
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,490
Hawaii, roger.

28
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,453
Hawaii, we expect to start EVA
over your station on this pass.

29
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,121
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

30
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,583
An unidentified object is closing on you
fast from astern.

31
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,918
Can you see it?

32
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,672
Hawaii, we have nothing here.
Hold while we check the space track.

33
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,050
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

34
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,970
Repeat, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

35
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,306
An unidentified object is on our scope.

36
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,517
We see nothing.

37
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,645
Can you give me a bearing?

38
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,396
Appears to be coming up fast,

39
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,440
from astern.

40
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,609
Hey, now I see it.

41
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,237
It's another spacecraft!

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,781
Repeat, it's another spacecraft!

43
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,951
Does it looks like a close pass?

44
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,827
You're breaking up. Say again.

45
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:44,164
- Does it look like a close pass?
- Chris, what's happening?

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,334
It's coming right at us.
The front is opening up!

47
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,295
I repeat, the front is opening up!

48
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:56,218
- It's coming right at us.
- Chris, get back in, get back in!

49
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,762
Do you read me? You're breaking up.

50
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,306
- Repeat, you're breaking up.
- What's happening?

51
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,517
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

52
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,937
Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Are you receiving?

53
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,773
You're breaking up. Come in, please.
Jupiter 16!

54
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,900
You're breaking up...

55
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,951
My lead line! It's cu...

56
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,248
Hawaii to Jupiter 16, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

57
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,543
Are you receiving me?
Come in, please. Over.

58
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,878
Hello, Houston.

59
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,131
We've lost radio contact.
We've also lost him on the scope.

60
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,633
Unidentified object is still orbiting.

61
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,720
Alert all stations and track him closely.

62
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,150
It is ridiculous for the Soviet government
to deny responsibility.

63
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,528
The Soviet government denies
all knowledge of this affair.

64
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,239
The world knows
we are a peace-loving people.

65
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,408
I hereby give notice that in 20 days

66
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,203
the United States
will launch her next spaceship.

67
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,539
My government has instructed me
to inform you

68
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,251
that any interference with it
will be regarded as an act of war.

69
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,045
May I ask what motive

70
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,631
our Russian friends would have

71
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,425
for wishing to destroy
American spacecraft?

72
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,178
My government sees this
as a blatant attempt

73
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,766
to gain complete and absolute control
of space itself for military purposes.

74
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,935
We don't agree.

75
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,562
Her Majesty's Government
is not convinced

76
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,024
that this intruder missile
originated from Soviet Russia.

77
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,902
Our tracking station in Singapore

78
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:41,406
reported faint echoes of this craft
coming down in the Sea of Japan area.

79
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,493
Might I suggest
that this is where you should

80
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,870
concentrate your intelligence forces?

81
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,707
The prime minister asked me to assure
you this is what we propose to do.

82
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,795
As a matter of fact, our man in Hong Kong
is working on it now.

83
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,390
Why do Chinese girls taste different
from all other girls?

84
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,559
You think we better?

85
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,644
No, just different.

86
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,729
Like Peking duck is different from

87
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,148
Russian caviar, but I love 'em both.

88
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,359
Darling, I give you very best duck.

89
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,528
That would be lovely.

90
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,282
We've had some interesting times
together, Ling. I'll be sorry to go.

91
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,681
Take that door.

92
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,850
The bed!

93
00:05:56,732 --> 00:06:00,277
- We're too late.
- At least he died on the job.

94
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,113
He'd have wanted it this way.

95
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,680
We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed

96
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:18,183
in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye,

97
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,269
at the last trump.

98
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,273
For the trumpet shall sound and
the dead shall be raised incorruptible,

99
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,441
and we shall all be changed.

100
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,237
We therefore commit his body to the deep
to be turned into corruption,

101
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:34,491
looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead.

102
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,535
Present!

103
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,789
Fire!

104
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,625
Fire!

105
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,670
Fire!

106
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,077
- Carry on.
- Aye aye, sir.

107
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,139
Permission to come aboard?

108
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,559
- Permission granted.
- Thank you.

109
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,647
- Take this officer aft.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,905
Number One, take her up to 90ft.
Course zero four five.

111
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,074
Aye aye, sir.

112
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,291
- Hello, Penny.
- You'd better go right in.

113
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,043
You're late as usual,
even from your own funeral.

114
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,212
We corpses have no sense of timing.

115
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,924
In you go... sir.

116
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,093
Thank you... ma'am.

117
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,773
- Sit down, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

118
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,776
- No ill effects?
- None at all, sir.

119
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:19,990
Now you're dead, perhaps some of your
old friends will pay less attention to you.

120
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:23,660
Give you more elbow room.
You'll need it, too.

121
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,915
This is the big one, 007. That's why
I'm out here. You're fully briefed?

122
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,584
Yes, but there's one thing
I don't understand.

123
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,462
If our Singapore tracking
station is correct

124
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,840
about the rocket not landing
in Russia, where did it land?

125
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,593
We assume it's Japan.
All this is guesswork,

126
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,888
but the PM wants us to play it
with everything we've got.

127
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,266
- And the aerial reconnaissance?
- All photographed. Nothing.

128
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,061
Are the Japanese equipped
to launch such a rocket?

129
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,064
- We don't think so.
- Then who else is?

130
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,566
That's what you've got to
find out, and fast.

131
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,527
Before the real shooting starts.

132
00:12:56,652 --> 00:13:00,447
This damn thing could blow up
into a full-scale war.

133
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,618
When you get to Tokyo,
go to that name and address.

134
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,037
Our man Henderson
will contact you there.

135
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,457
- Henderson.
- Captain here. Full ahead.

136
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,167
Right.

137
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,964
- That's all.
- Thank you, sir.

138
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,549
- 007.
- Sir?

139
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,426
We've only three weeks
to the next American launch.

140
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,011
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:26,890
My sources tell me the Russians
are planning one even earlier.

142
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,143
- So move fast, 007.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,444
By the way, how was the girl?

144
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,905
Which girl?

145
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,324
The Chinese one we fixed you up with.

146
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,869
Another five minutes, I'd have found out.

147
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,621
She'll never know what she missed.

148
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,042
Miss Moneypenny,
give 007 the password we've agreed

149
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,712
- with Japanese SIS.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,631
We tried to think of something
you wouldn't forget.

151
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,799
Yes?

152
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:05,262
I... love... you.

153
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,598
Repeat it, please,
to make sure you get it.

154
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,391
Don't worry, I get it.

155
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,226
Sayonara.

156
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,604
James... good luck.

157
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,608
Instant Japanese. You may need it.

158
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,613
You forget, I took a first
in oriental languages at Cambridge.

159
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,161
Stand by to load.

160
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,999
Lift to the launch!

161
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,589
Tube loaded.

162
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:41,715
Hubcap open.

163
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,470
Fire.

164
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,412
This is your ticket.

165
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,168
Thank you.

166
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,378
Dozo.

167
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,725
I love you.

168
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,061
I have a car nearby.

169
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:26,899
- Where do you suggest we go?
- I know a quiet hotel.

170
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,988
- And?
- Where your friend is waiting.

171
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,283
Mr Henderson.

172
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,998
Wasn't Mr Henderson
able to come himself?

173
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,792
- I suppose not.
- Why?

174
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,128
He didn't say.

175
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,854
I think it's about hotel-time.

176
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,758
How long have you
worked for Henderson?

177
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:39,096
Long enough to learn not to discuss
such matters with strangers.

178
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:01,994
- Mr Henderson's waiting for you.
- You're not coming in with me?

179
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,122
Mr Henderson would like
to see you alone.

180
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,800
Do come in.

181
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,804
Mr Henderson?

182
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,973
At your service.

183
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,409
I believe you wanted to
ask me some questions.

184
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,912
Yes. Excuse me.

185
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,669
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you got it right.

186
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:56,089
I lost that in Singapore in '42.

187
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:00,511
You must excuse
this rather odd mixture of styles,

188
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,430
but I refuse to go entirely Japanese.

189
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,642
Very fond of some of these old things.

190
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,771
- You've never been to Japan before?
- No, never.

191
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,899
I myself have lived here for...

192
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,652
28 years.

193
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,154
And I'm just beginning
to know my way about.

194
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:23,659
- Your most vital contact will be Tanaka.
- Tanaka?

195
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,453
He's head of the Japanese secret service.

196
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:30,165
And his identity is the most
closely guarded secret in Japan.

197
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,376
When can I see him?

198
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:36,463
- You can see Tiger tonight.
- Tiger?

199
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,217
His closest friends
are permitted to call him that.

200
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,886
- Do you have any leads of your own?
- Yes, I do.

201
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,764
That's stirred not shaken.
That was right?

202
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,474
Perfect.

203
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,643
Cheers.

204
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,397
Russian vodka. Well done.

205
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:57,067
Yes, I get it from the doorman
at the Russian embassy.

206
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,403
Amongst certain other things.

207
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,822
Now, look. I think London's theory

208
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:05,492
about the missile being fired
from this country is right.

209
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,120
I don't know how or where.

210
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,706
And don't ask me who's doing it either.

211
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:17,129
But I have a fairly shrewd idea
that a major foreign power is behind it all.

212
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,965
You mean, apart from Russia and Japan?

213
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,260
It's not Russia, old boy, I'm sure of that.

214
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,387
It's not Japan either.

215
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:29,850
Although a large Japanese
industrial concern is...

216
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,264
Good evening.

217
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,977
Cheers.

218
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,233
Siamese vodka?

219
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,239
There he is!

220
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,291
Freeze!

221
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,643
Get in, quick!

222
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,861
What the hell's the score?

223
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:17,573
What do you mean?
My job is to help you.

224
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,741
Like you helped Henderson?

225
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,994
I'm taking you to a place of safety.

226
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,372
No, this time I'm taking you.
I want some information now.

227
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:29,626
- I have no information to give you.
- We'll see about that. Slow down.

228
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,972
Welcome.

229
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,603
Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond.

230
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,689
It is a great pleasure to meet you at last.

231
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,819
And how do you like our country so far?

232
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:44,827
I am a trifle disappointed at the ease
with which I could pull you in.

233
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,622
The one thing my honourable mother
taught me long ago

234
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:51,542
was never to get into a car
with a strange girl.

235
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:55,754
But you, I'm afraid,
will get into anything with any girl!

236
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,595
You have a lot of energy
for a dead man, Mr Bond.

237
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,103
You are James Bond, aren't you?

238
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,486
I am so very pleased to meet you,
Bond-san. I really am.

239
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,614
Permit me to introduce myself.

240
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,076
My name is Tanaka. Please call me Tiger.

241
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:29,288
If you're Tanaka,
how do you feel about me?

242
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,624
I... love you.

243
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:35,544
I'm glad we got that out of the way.

244
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:38,714
I'd like you to examine these
as soon as possible.

245
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,841
They're from Osato's safe.

246
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,305
This is an order for naval stores.

247
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,100
500 kilos of butter, 50 containers of lox.

248
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,020
What is lox?

249
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,856
An American name for smoked salmon.

250
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:59,067
But it's also the technical name
for liquid oxygen.

251
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,236
Which makes rocket fuel.

252
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,405
- Very interesting.
- Yes.

253
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,365
We must go.

254
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:08,535
The journey out will be more dignified
than the journey in.

255
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,787
That wouldn't be difficult.

256
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:13,207
I'd like that negative enlarged.

257
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:15,334
OK.

258
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,799
My private train.

259
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,344
I never travel in the streets of Tokyo.

260
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,222
In my position, it would be most unwise.

261
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:33,852
Very convenient.

262
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:37,814
I imagine that your Mr M in London
has a similar arrangement.

263
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,983
M? Oh yes, but of course.

264
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:43,111
Then the girl in the white
sports car's one of us.

265
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:45,072
- Aki? Yes.
- Very competent.

266
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:46,949
- Domo arigato.
- Dozo.

267
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,786
Do you like Japanese sake,
or would you prefer vodka martini?

268
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,788
Oh, no. I like sake.

269
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:58,043
Especially when it's served
at the correct temperature.

270
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,212
98.4° Fahrenheit, like this is.

271
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:03,465
For a European,
you are exceptionally cultivated.

272
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,595
- We'll see the photograph you found.
- Good.

273
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,521
A ship and a strip of land.
It could be anywhere.

274
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:19,606
My men found a microdot on the paper.

275
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,775
Enlarge!

276
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:27,447
It says, 'Photograph taken by female
American tourist from coastal vessel. '

277
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:30,617
'The woman has been liquidated
as a routine precaution. '

278
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:34,329
- Can we see the photograph again?
- Of course.

279
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:37,791
They killed an innocent tourist
for taking this?

280
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:40,127
Can you make it bigger?

281
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,045
Ning-Po.

282
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:45,215
Check motor vessel Ning-Po. Full details.

283
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,302
All recent movements
and present whereabouts.

284
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:52,556
- What's that on the left?
- Focus on the left!

285
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:55,184
Ama. Diving girls.

286
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,311
Can you identify that coastline?

287
00:32:57,436 --> 00:32:59,479
Given time, yes.

288
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,030
- Who is the head of Osato Chemicals?
- Mr Osato.

289
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,782
Can you arrange an appointment
with him tomorrow?

290
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,242
Of course.

291
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,953
But tonight, consider my house yours.

292
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,290
Including all of my possessions,
naturally.

293
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,593
My friend, now you take
your first civilised bath.

294
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,262
Really? Well, I like the plumbing.

295
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:36,225
Place yourself entirely in their hands,
my dear Bond-san.

296
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,645
Rule number one...
is never do anything for yourself

297
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,897
when someone else can do it for you.

298
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,566
- And number two?
- Rule number two:

299
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:48,529
in Japan, men always come first.
Women come second.

300
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,864
I might just retire to here.

301
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:00,040
Your English girls would never perform
this simple service.

302
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,501
I know one or two
who might get round to it.

303
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:05,128
Miss Moneypenny, perhaps?

304
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:07,798
We have our sources,
Bond-san, just like you.

305
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,760
Don't get the soap in my eye, will you?

306
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:21,103
I suppose you know what it is about you
that fascinates them.

307
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:25,899
It's the hair on your chest.
Japanese men have beautiful bare skin.

308
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:28,068
Japanese proverb say,

309
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:31,655
'Bird never make nest in bare tree. '

310
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,745
If Henderson's theory is right,

311
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:42,499
why would a foreign power
want to launch missiles from Japan?

312
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:46,211
Because if they were discovered,
they could deny responsibility.

313
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:49,506
Especially if some private organisation's
doing the work.

314
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:51,675
- Osato?
- Perhaps.

315
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,595
Mr Osato is one of
our greatest industrialists.

316
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,471
No, he's merely a front.

317
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,558
- Who is big enough?
- SPECTRE.

318
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,018
Could be.

319
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,979
Now, massage. Which girl do you select?

320
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,695
I'll settle for this little old lady here.

321
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,030
Good choice.

322
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,199
She's very sexyful.

323
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:26,668
The last time someone gave me
a massage was in Hong Kong.

324
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:32,007
But unfortunately...
we had to cut it short.

325
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:35,719
We were rudely interrupted
by a couple of gunmen.

326
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:39,223
So, we never got around to finishing it.

327
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,809
This time, you shall finish it.

328
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,523
Aki.

329
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,865
No one will disturb you tonight.

330
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:04,915
I think I will enjoy very much
serving under you.

331
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,317
- Mr Fisher?
- Yes.

332
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:34,945
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

333
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,704
Please come in, Mr Fisher.

334
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:46,623
- Mr Osato is expecting you.
- Thank you.

335
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:48,792
You are three and a half minutes early.

336
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,961
Please be seated.

337
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:19,466
- How do you do, Mr Fisher?
- How do you do?

338
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:22,636
Miss Grant, my confidential secretary.

339
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,763
- Hello.
- Hello.

340
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:28,851
- May we offer you some champagne?
- No, thank you, it's too early for me.

341
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:31,019
- You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.

342
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:34,022
I always take a glass in the morning.

343
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,650
- You should try it.
- It's bad for your liver.

344
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:40,863
- Nonsense, it adds a sparkle to the day.
- I'm sure it does.

345
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:50,038
A Dom Pérignon '59, Mr Fisher.

346
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:53,917
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- Well, if you insist.

347
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,129
- Please be seated, Mr Fisher.
- Thank you.

348
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:04,970
So, you are the new managing director

349
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,889
- of Empire Chemicals?
- Yes.

350
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,600
- What happened to Williamson?
- Williamson?

351
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:12,436
He died rather suddenly, poor chap.

352
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,438
Ah, so. From what?

353
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:16,607
He fell into a pulveriser at the works.

354
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:18,775
Ah, so.

355
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:20,903
How shocking.

356
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:25,365
- A very honourable death, all the same.
- Very.

357
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,701
He gained great face with the company.

358
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,456
I hope you are not taking
any risks yourself, Mr Fisher.

359
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:34,917
Me? I never take any risks.

360
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,961
You forgive me for saying so, but...

361
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,964
I think you are taking one now.

362
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:42,925
I am?

363
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,177
You should give up smoking.

364
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:47,346
Cigarettes are very bad for your chest.

365
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,182
Mr Osato believes in a healthy chest.

366
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,059
Really?

367
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:55,229
You must tell me what I can do for you.

368
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:59,066
We're interested in the bulk-buying
of fermentation chemicals.

369
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:02,236
Monosodium glutamate
and ascorbic acid.

370
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,989
- Would you like a manufacturing licence?
- Yes, very much.

371
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:10,244
I'll have my sales manager
get the quotations

372
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,163
and delivery dates for you
as soon as possible.

373
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,708
We'll contact you later today
at your hotel.

374
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,837
- Which hotel are you staying at?
- The Hilton.

375
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,423
Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

376
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,552
- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure to meet you, too.

377
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,514
- Goodbye, Miss Brandt.
- Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

378
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,728
Kill him.

379
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,663
Get down!

380
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:39,833
294 here. Tiger, immediate.

381
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,044
Come in, 294.

382
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:47,299
Zero-zero is with me. We are being
chased by gunmen, in black sedan.

383
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,510
I'm heading south for Highway Two.

384
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,678
Arrange usual reception, please.

385
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,277
- How's that for Japanese efficiency?
- Just a drop in the ocean.

386
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:35,491
- Zero-zero?
- Yes, Tiger.

387
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:37,826
Ning-Po is owned by Osato Chemicals.

388
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:41,830
- That fits. Go on.
- Vessel now loading in Kobe docks.

389
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:45,250
Sailing for Shanghai
at 5pm this afternoon.

390
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:49,755
Suggest you proceed Kobe immediately
to look her over.

391
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,508
- Can we make it?
- Yes, just.

392
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,843
Proceeding immediately, Kobe docks.

393
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,178
Tiger, contact M.

394
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,390
Tell him to send Little Nellie.

395
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:02,142
Repeat, Little Nellie.

396
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,854
Suggest she be accompanied
by her father.

397
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:08,440
Most urgent. Understood?

398
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,733
Understood.

399
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:38,595
Condensation: ice-cold. Liquid oxygen.

400
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,795
Get out of here. Contact Tanaka.

401
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:14,006
I'm not leaving you.

402
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:17,759
Tell him to keep that ship shadowed.

403
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:19,720
Go now.

404
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:50,561
Take him to Number 11.

405
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:55,774
- Wake him up.
- Are you finished?

406
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:59,486
Where am I?

407
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:01,655
You're in my cabin on the Ning-Po.

408
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,534
Leave him to me now. Wait in there.
And shut the door.

409
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,870
I've got you now.

410
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:09,997
Enjoy yourself.

411
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,586
- Who are you working for?
- Empire Chemicals, you know that.

412
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,173
- Do all their people carry guns?
- When they're abroad, yes.

413
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,467
And why were you
snooping around the docks?

414
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:25,554
I like ships. And I used to be a sailor.

415
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,347
You are a liar.

416
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:36,356
- Do you know what this is?
- I'd rather not.

417
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:39,193
Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome.

418
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:42,279
They use it to slice off skin.

419
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:48,202
I hope you won't force me to use it.

420
00:47:56,793 --> 00:48:00,172
Now, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

421
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:12,351
I have a confession to make.

422
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:14,186
What?

423
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:16,855
Actually, I'm a spy.

424
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,024
I know that.

425
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:27,783
I suppose you know that
industrial secrets are big business?

426
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:34,873
I've stolen Osato's new process
for making monosodium glutamate.

427
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,291
And...

428
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,585
Well, it's worth

429
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,879
$300,000.

430
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:42,798
So?

431
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:47,261
I'll split it with you if you'll get me
out of here and back to Tokyo.

432
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:49,471
That's a nice offer.

433
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:53,475
- How about it?
- I'm afraid not.

434
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,269
Why?

435
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:02,693
Osato would kill me.

436
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:09,825
We could fly to Europe tomorrow,
you and I.

437
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:37,311
The things I do for England.

438
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:54,745
Now, you are going to need some
very close... protection tonight in Tokyo

439
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:58,332
because... well, that's when
they'll try and get at you.

440
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:00,501
You'll need the best man we've got.

441
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:02,669
And who do you suggest?

442
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:04,630
Well,

443
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:05,964
me.

444
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:09,301
I'm afraid I have another appointment
tonight, Mr Fisher.

445
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:14,515
I'm awfully sorry to leave you...
but I have to get off.

446
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:16,076
Chasing girls will be the end of you,
Bond-san, I have told you before.

447
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:18,912
He didn't chase her.
He did it so I could get away.

448
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:21,206
He wouldn't touch that horrible girl.

449
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,417
- Would you?
- Heaven forbid.

450
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:25,335
Any progress?

451
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,380
Yes. We identified
the coastline in the photograph.

452
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:33,177
It is an island called Matsu, on the direct
route between Kobe and Shanghai.

453
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,512
We shadowed the Ning-Po in a helicopter.

454
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:37,848
- Did it stop at the island?
- I think so.

455
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:41,393
It was a very dark night.
Impossible to see her all the time.

456
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:44,313
But we know she stopped somewhere.
Look at these.

457
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:46,648
That one we took last night.

458
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:51,069
And that one, early this morning.

459
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:55,199
- Notice, please, the water line.
- You're right.

460
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:57,659
Fully laden here and empty here.

461
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,913
I want to take a fast look
at the island now.

462
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:04,583
- Has Little Nellie arrived yet?
- Yes, and her father.

463
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:09,713
Ah, welcome to Japan, Dad.
Is my little girl hot and ready?

464
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,800
Look, 007, I've had a long and tiring
journey, probably to no purpose.

465
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:16,345
I'm in no mood for your juvenile quips.

466
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:35,948
I have much curiosity, Bond-san.

467
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:37,825
What is Little Nellie?

468
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:41,537
She's a wonderful girl.
Very small, quite fast.

469
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:43,914
Can do anything. Just your type.

470
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:46,041
A toy helicopter?

471
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:49,753
No, it's certainly not a toy! You'll see.

472
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:52,714
We've made some improvements
since you used her last.

473
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:56,677
- I'll give you the drill.
- This is only for children. Don't use it!

474
00:52:56,802 --> 00:52:58,846
Take my helicopter instead.

475
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:01,139
Right. Now pay attention.

476
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:03,892
- Two machine guns, fixed.
- Synchronised to what?

477
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:07,020
100 yards, using incendiaries
and high explosives.

478
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:09,189
Two rocket launchers,

479
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:11,900
- forward-firing on either side.
- Fine.

480
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:16,446
Now, these fire heat-seeking
air-to-air missiles. 60 a minute.

481
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:17,781
Good.

482
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:20,576
Flame guns. Two of 'em. Firing astern.

483
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:24,246
- What range?
- 80 yards. Two smoke ejectors next door.

484
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,250
Aerial mines. Now remember,

485
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,878
use them only
when directly above target.

486
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:34,339
- That's about the lot. You know the rest.
- Yes.

487
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:37,009
Cine camera.

488
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:40,429
- Tanaka, listen in on 410 megacycles.
- Good luck!

489
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:42,973
I'll contact you when I get over the island.

490
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:45,184
Be careful, Bond-san!

491
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:48,038
Hello, Base One.

492
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:51,625
I'm over the island and the fishing village.
Nothing to report.

493
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,585
We'll keep listening.

494
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:25,367
Hello, Base One.
There's nothing here but volcanoes.

495
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:28,495
Understood. Carry on.

496
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,965
- Hello, Base One.
- Listening.

497
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,134
Little Nellie got a hot reception.

498
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:31,637
Four big-shots made
improper advances,

499
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:34,640
but she defended her honour
with great success.

500
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:36,934
- Heading for home.
- Do not come home.

501
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:39,102
Russian space shot imminent.

502
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:42,231
Proceed vector4-6 degrees
and await instructions.

503
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:44,358
- Understood?
- Roger and out.

504
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:02,931
Clear the area. Clear the area.

505
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:15,152
Prepare for reception.

506
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:18,572
Prepare for reception.

507
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:22,159
Radar blackout is now complete.

508
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:26,205
Radar blackout is now complete.

509
01:02:43,805 --> 01:02:46,475
Moscow radio's already saying we did it.

510
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,394
The president's called
a press conference for 2pm.

511
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,855
He'll deny emphatically we were involved.

512
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,982
- But can we prove it?
- Of course not.

513
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:56,318
No one will believe the Russians did it.

514
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:59,738
Now they'll use the excuse
to shoot down our next Jupiter.

515
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:04,284
Houston to Washington. We followed him
for one orbit, now he's off the screen.

516
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:06,495
That means he's coming down.

517
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:10,541
- Yeah, but where?
- Some place in Russia. It has to be.

518
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:14,378
The British theory about Japan
is nonsense.

519
01:03:14,503 --> 01:03:16,547
- Forget Japan.
- I agree.

520
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:20,092
We've re-photographed
every square inch.

521
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,880
Ventilator fans to full power.

522
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:00,090
Open all air ducts.

523
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:02,217
Area safe to enter.

524
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:04,386
All crews to stations.

525
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:06,763
All air ducts to normal.

526
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:10,601
Air ducts opened.

527
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:12,895
- Close crater.
- Closing crater.

528
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:15,939
Fire guards to station.

529
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:30,370
Ventilator fans to normal. Open shutters.

530
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:35,000
Reception complete.

531
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:39,588
Withdraw captive spaceship.

532
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:44,843
Guards to stations.

533
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:18,293
Remove the prisoners.

534
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,734
I shall be in my apartment.

535
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:46,029
I may send for you later.

536
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:17,644
I must congratulate you, gentlemen,
upon your superb equipment.

537
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:20,689
We congratulate you, sir,
upon the way you handle it.

538
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:24,067
Our clients are satisfied
with the progress so far?

539
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:27,696
- My government is quite satisfied.
- Good.

540
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:29,364
Hans!

541
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:37,664
You will see that my piranha fish
get very hungry.

542
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:42,544
They can strip a man to the bone
in 30 seconds.

543
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:57,601
I have decided to ask for
a little money in advance.

544
01:06:57,726 --> 01:07:02,022
I want the sum of 100 million dollars,
in gold bullion,

545
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:04,775
deposited in our account in Buenos Aires.

546
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,402
Our agreement states
no money should be paid

547
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:11,031
until war has broken out
between Russia and the United States.

548
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:15,327
- This is extortion.
- Extortion is my business.

549
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:17,913
Go and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy.

550
01:07:18,914 --> 01:07:22,084
Osato and Number 11, report now.

551
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:40,144
An unknown Englishman
was in your office the other day.

552
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:42,146
Correct, Number One.

553
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:45,232
- Do you know what gun this is?
- Walther PPK.

554
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:49,486
Only one person we know
uses this sort of gun.

555
01:07:50,571 --> 01:07:52,781
James Bond.

556
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:56,493
- But Bond is dead.
- It was in all the newspapers.

557
01:07:56,618 --> 01:07:57,911
Rubbish.

558
01:07:58,078 --> 01:08:00,080
Bond is alive.

559
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:02,583
Unless you killed him, Mr Osato?

560
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,878
Don't tell me you let him go.

561
01:08:06,336 --> 01:08:09,506
I gave Number 11
the strictest orders to eliminate him.

562
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,466
And did she?

563
01:08:11,592 --> 01:08:13,719
She failed.

564
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:17,139
You should have killed him.
You had plenty of opportunity.

565
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:20,100
This organisation
does not tolerate failure.

566
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:23,103
- I know, but you see, I...
- Go!

567
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:26,732
Well?

568
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:37,826
Osato!

569
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:49,505
Kill Bond! Now!

570
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:52,674
Yes, Number One. Yes. Yes, yes.

571
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:35,551
- Hello.
- Bad news from outer space.

572
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:39,346
Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians
are accusing the Americans.

573
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:41,557
Next time it will be war.

574
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:44,601
- We'll have to get down to the volcanoes.
- I agree.

575
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:47,771
We'll also need
a company of first-rate men.

576
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:50,107
Do you have any commandos here?

577
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:52,276
I have much, much better.

578
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:55,154
Ninjas. Top-secret, Bond-san.

579
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:58,073
This is my ninja training school.

580
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:08,333
- Ninjas?
- The art of concealment and surprise.

581
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:46,747
This must develop
very fast reflex actions.

582
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:48,624
And spiritual strength.

583
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:24,576
Now, we will see some modern ninjas.

584
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:30,207
My plan is this.

585
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:32,376
I make a base on the Ama island.

586
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,878
100 of my ninjas will slide in unseen.

587
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:37,965
They will be workers and fishermen.

588
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:40,217
- What about me?
- Later.

589
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:43,762
But for the moment,
these will interest you. Rocket guns.

590
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:45,556
Very powerful.

591
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:48,142
See the holes in the back
for jet propulsion.

592
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:54,356
- It's a fine gun.
- All rocket guns.

593
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:58,193
This is our special baby rocket.

594
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:02,990
Very useful for people who smoke
too many cigarettes, like you.

595
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:13,167
- Accurate up to 30 yards.
- Very neat.

596
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:16,753
- It can save your life.
- You sound like a commercial.

597
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:21,758
- What's the plan for me?
- First, you become a Japanese.

598
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:24,261
Second, you train hard and quickly

599
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:26,805
to become a ninja like us.

600
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:30,851
And third, to give you extra-special cover,

601
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:33,020
you take a wife.

602
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:43,572
Regretfully impossible.

603
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:45,491
You must marry Ama girl.

604
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:47,701
One who is known on the island.

605
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:51,163
- Is she pretty?
- She has a face like a pig.

606
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:54,750
- To hell with that idea.
- But this is duty.

607
01:12:56,835 --> 01:12:59,379
The girl I have chosen
is an agent of mine.

608
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:01,965
But first, you must become Japanese.

609
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:10,015
Eyepieces to Hera.

610
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:17,981
Why don't you just
dye the parts that show?

611
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:31,411
- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.

612
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:39,837
Tiger said, from now on,

613
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:42,881
you must do everything Japanese-style.

614
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:45,050
Everything?

615
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:47,219
Good for Tiger.

616
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:53,387
I'm...

617
01:15:55,806 --> 01:15:58,142
I... I...

618
01:15:58,267 --> 01:15:59,309
Aki!

619
01:15:59,434 --> 01:16:01,520
I'm...

620
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:12,156
She's dead.

621
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,284
Poisoned.

622
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:21,081
Tiger, we must get to that island.

623
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:24,459
You're almost ready.
Just two more days' training.

624
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:08,837
- You killed him.
- Yeah, he tried to kill me.

625
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:14,384
This man is a stranger from outside.

626
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:18,555
It's lucky we're getting out of here.

627
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:22,518
Tomorrow you will be a poor Japanese
worker, with humble Japanese wife.

628
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:24,728
Yeah, with a face like a pig.

629
01:20:57,274 --> 01:20:59,318
My men are already ashore.

630
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:01,487
All over the island.

631
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:05,365
We have four days left.
It is not much time.

632
01:22:06,802 --> 01:22:08,846
This is my house.

633
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,644
My friend has made us some food.

634
01:22:17,729 --> 01:22:19,731
Do you live here alone?

635
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:22,484
Yes. My parents are dead.

636
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:24,653
Sit down, please.

637
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:28,407
Oysters.

638
01:22:28,532 --> 01:22:31,160
Is this the only room there is?

639
01:22:31,285 --> 01:22:32,995
Yes.

640
01:22:33,203 --> 01:22:35,164
That is your bed.

641
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,374
I shall sleep over there.

642
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:42,129
- We're supposed to be married.
- Think again, please.

643
01:22:42,254 --> 01:22:44,298
You gave false name to priest.

644
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:47,634
But we must keep up appearances!
We're on our honeymoon.

645
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:50,220
No honeymoon. This is business.

646
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,102
I won't need these.

647
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:29,092
- Bond-san.
- What's wrong?

648
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:32,638
The Americans have changed
the launching date.

649
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:34,807
The countdown has already started.

650
01:23:34,932 --> 01:23:38,018
The president has given
a last warning to the Russians.

651
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:40,771
- When does it go up?
- Tonight, midnight. Our time.

652
01:23:40,896 --> 01:23:44,608
- Did your men search the island?
- Yes. There is nothing but volcanoes.

653
01:23:44,733 --> 01:23:46,777
Everything is so normal around here.

654
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:49,196
- Nothing happens.
- One thing has happened.

655
01:23:49,321 --> 01:23:52,407
Yesterday an Ama girl
rowed her boat into Ryuzaki.

656
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:55,202
- Ryuzaki?
- It is a big cave on the mainland.

657
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:57,663
And when her boat floated out again,

658
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:59,623
she was dead.

659
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:04,711
- Was that the funeral we saw yesterday?
- Yes.

660
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:07,214
- How did she die?
- Nobody knows.

661
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:11,009
- Can you take me to this cave?
- Yes.

662
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:12,886
We'll slip away from the fishing fleet
in the morning.

663
01:24:55,345 --> 01:24:57,181
All right?

664
01:24:57,306 --> 01:24:59,349
Now, where is this cave?

665
01:24:59,475 --> 01:25:01,518
It's straight across.

666
01:25:01,643 --> 01:25:03,645
The cave is over there.

667
01:25:32,424 --> 01:25:34,510
Gas. Get over the side.

668
01:25:34,676 --> 01:25:36,011
Quick!

669
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:04,081
Phosgene gas, to keep the visitors away.

670
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:07,042
Did you notice the sulphur on the walls?

671
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,211
- The yellow?
- Yes.

672
01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:12,631
It was once an underground outlet
for the volcanic lava.

673
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:16,468
- There must be a long tunnel.
- Miles of it.

674
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:18,887
It leads all the way,

675
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:20,556
right up to the top.

676
01:26:20,681 --> 01:26:22,975
That's where we have to go.
Can you make it?

677
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,769
Of course. It's business.

678
01:26:25,894 --> 01:26:27,229
Good.

679
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:49,084
May I rest a moment?

680
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:51,253
Surely.

681
01:26:54,548 --> 01:26:56,550
It's hard work.

682
01:26:58,135 --> 01:26:59,761
Some honeymoon!

683
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:31,168
It's going down! Into the volcano!

684
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:38,383
Heliport to position.

685
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:43,096
The honeymoon's over. Come on.

686
01:28:18,715 --> 01:28:21,343
This volcano isn't active, is it?

687
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:23,846
It never has been. Not in my lifetime.

688
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:27,141
There's been some
terrific heat here recently.

689
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:29,351
What happened to the helicopter?

690
01:28:29,476 --> 01:28:31,478
It's down there somewhere.

691
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:34,439
Come on.

692
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:38,569
Stand by. Mark.

693
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:40,863
Stand by for ten-second countdown.

694
01:28:41,029 --> 01:28:42,823
10, 9, 8...

695
01:28:42,948 --> 01:28:45,659
All units worldwide
will remain at readiness

696
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:48,036
so long as the spacecraft is in orbit.

697
01:28:48,203 --> 01:28:50,289
.. 3, 2, 1.

698
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:54,209
Ignition.

699
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:08,056
This is it, gentlemen.
All we can do now is wait and pray.

700
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:31,163
Is that deep?

701
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:33,332
They usually are - very.

702
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:39,922
It's metal!

703
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:42,090
Wait here.

704
01:29:56,438 --> 01:29:59,066
Heliport to takeoff position.

705
01:30:05,572 --> 01:30:07,241
Open crater.

706
01:30:25,968 --> 01:30:27,886
Emergency crews to stations.

707
01:30:29,012 --> 01:30:32,099
Go to Tanaka.
Tell him to come with every man he's got.

708
01:30:32,266 --> 01:30:33,433
Yes.

709
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,511
Heliport to standby position.

710
01:31:51,845 --> 01:31:54,348
Astronauts to dressing rooms.

711
01:31:55,224 --> 01:31:57,226
Astronauts to dressing rooms.

712
01:32:07,694 --> 01:32:09,488
Attention, attention.

713
01:32:09,613 --> 01:32:13,075
American target vehicle is now in orbit.

714
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:17,162
Interception will take place
in two hours' time.

715
01:32:32,136 --> 01:32:34,179
Washington, this is Houston.

716
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:36,306
Houston to Washington.

717
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:40,853
Our vehicle is now
120 nautical miles altitude,

718
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,314
170 miles downrange.

719
01:32:47,526 --> 01:32:50,737
Jupiter to Houston,
we now have second phase.

720
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:52,865
Roger, Jupiter.

721
01:32:53,031 --> 01:32:56,034
Four hours 36 minutes into the mission.

722
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,829
- Can you give us a time?
- Roger.

723
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:04,543
Connect igniter cable.

724
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:08,255
Connect igniter cable.

725
01:33:34,573 --> 01:33:37,409
Radar technicians, report to control room.

726
01:33:38,535 --> 01:33:41,705
Radar technicians, report to control room.

727
01:34:00,808 --> 01:34:03,769
T minus 100 minutes and counting.

728
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:08,023
Did you volunteer for astronaut training?

729
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:11,401
In our country, we say cosmonaut.
Yes, both of us...

730
01:34:13,904 --> 01:34:16,698
Yes, since six months we started training.

731
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:19,701
Good evening.

732
01:34:19,827 --> 01:34:21,703
Who the hell are you?

733
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:24,248
Stand back, I'm gonna blow the lock.

734
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:33,715
Stand back.

735
01:34:43,267 --> 01:34:45,310
Get into their uniforms.

736
01:35:47,706 --> 01:35:50,000
Astronauts have two minutes.

737
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:52,169
Repeat, two minutes.

738
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:02,054
Reserve astronaut to stand by.

739
01:36:04,723 --> 01:36:07,810
- Lock on target.
- Lock on target vehicle.

740
01:36:07,893 --> 01:36:10,145
Check secondary guidance.

741
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:14,858
Launch time is now
T minus 90 minutes and counting.

742
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:17,444
Astronauts to launching pad.

743
01:36:17,569 --> 01:36:19,738
Astronauts to launching pad.

744
01:36:20,864 --> 01:36:24,660
Repeat, astronauts
to launching pad immediately.

745
01:37:03,824 --> 01:37:06,743
Crews, stand by on gantry.

746
01:37:07,786 --> 01:37:09,663
Crews, stand by on gantry.

747
01:37:44,323 --> 01:37:48,243
- Stop that astronaut. Bring him to me.
- Stop that astronaut!

748
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:51,872
- Summon the reserve astronaut!
- Reserve astronaut!

749
01:37:51,997 --> 01:37:55,793
Reserve astronaut
to launching pad, immediately.

750
01:38:04,718 --> 01:38:07,596
Re-coordinate with target vehicle.

751
01:38:07,721 --> 01:38:09,014
A new update

752
01:38:09,139 --> 01:38:13,644
with target vehicle
has been received from computers.

753
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:19,358
We now have T minus seven minutes
and counting.

754
01:38:19,483 --> 01:38:21,985
You made a mistake, my friend.

755
01:38:22,152 --> 01:38:25,322
No astronaut enters the capsule
with his air conditioner.

756
01:38:25,447 --> 01:38:27,157
Remove his helmet!

757
01:38:32,788 --> 01:38:34,832
James Bond.

758
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:38,752
Allow me to introduce myself.

759
01:38:40,212 --> 01:38:43,173
I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

760
01:38:44,341 --> 01:38:47,219
They told me
you were assassinated in Hong Kong.

761
01:38:47,928 --> 01:38:49,972
Yes, this is my second life.

762
01:38:52,099 --> 01:38:54,309
You only live twice, Mr Bond.

763
01:38:54,434 --> 01:38:57,104
Target vehicle
passing over central Russia.

764
01:38:57,229 --> 01:38:59,356
Approaching Mongolia.

765
01:38:59,481 --> 01:39:02,192
Track is as predicted. All computers...

766
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:05,654
As you see,
I am about to inaugurate a little war.

767
01:39:05,779 --> 01:39:10,325
In a matter of hours, when America
and Russia have annihilated each other,

768
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:13,203
we shall see a new power
dominating the world.

769
01:39:13,328 --> 01:39:17,583
- Target vehicle on scope.
- Brief check on target vehicle.

770
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:20,335
Remove his suit and search him.

771
01:39:20,461 --> 01:39:23,589
Reserve astronaut ready on Bird 1.

772
01:39:33,348 --> 01:39:34,725
Prepare for firing.

773
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:36,894
Clear the area.

774
01:39:37,936 --> 01:39:39,980
Clear the area.

775
01:39:42,232 --> 01:39:44,735
Emergency services to stand by.

776
01:39:45,736 --> 01:39:47,779
Area now clear.

777
01:39:51,366 --> 01:39:54,995
T minus one minute,
30 seconds and counting.

778
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:58,415
Re-coordinate with target vehicle.

779
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,626
Bird 1 now in readiness.

780
01:40:01,376 --> 01:40:04,755
Astronauts ready on Bird.
All systems are go.

781
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,966
Close shutters.

782
01:40:09,051 --> 01:40:12,262
- Radar blackout commence.
- Radar blackout in operation.

783
01:40:15,724 --> 01:40:18,393
Effective range, kilometres 800.

784
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:21,480
- Open crater.
- Opening crater.

785
01:40:24,024 --> 01:40:26,068
Crater opening.

786
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:29,238
Bird 1 to liftoff position.

787
01:40:47,339 --> 01:40:51,802
Gimbal the engines.
Pressurised tanks open.

788
01:40:51,927 --> 01:40:54,930
Ventilator fans to full power.

789
01:40:55,097 --> 01:40:56,265
10 seconds.

790
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:58,267
9, 8,

791
01:40:58,392 --> 01:41:00,060

01:41:02,312 --> 01:41:04,231
3, 2,

794
01:41:04,356 --> 01:41:06,275
1, 0.

795
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,694
Ignition.

796
01:41:34,428 --> 01:41:36,263
Close crater!

797
01:41:36,388 --> 01:41:38,390
Closing crater.

798
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:43,770
Open shutters!

799
01:42:23,227 --> 01:42:25,479
Bird 1 to base. Separation complete.

800
01:42:25,604 --> 01:42:27,898
Confirm acquisition.

801
01:42:28,023 --> 01:42:30,234
Calling Bird 1.

802
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:33,821
You are 70 nautical miles downrange.
200 miles altitude.

803
01:42:33,987 --> 01:42:37,115
Hans, our job will soon be done.

804
01:42:37,241 --> 01:42:41,662
Blow them up as soon as they have
captured the Americans. Here is the key

805
01:42:42,996 --> 01:42:45,332
to operate the exploder button.

806
01:42:45,457 --> 01:42:47,668
There are men in the crater!

807
01:42:49,336 --> 01:42:50,337
Crater guns, fire.

808
01:42:51,338 --> 01:42:53,382
Crater guns, open fire.

809
01:43:15,612 --> 01:43:17,823
The firing power inside my crater

810
01:43:17,948 --> 01:43:20,242
is enough to annihilate a small army.

811
01:43:21,076 --> 01:43:23,287
You can watch it all on TV.

812
01:43:23,412 --> 01:43:26,498
It's the last programme
you're likely to see.

813
01:43:26,623 --> 01:43:30,127
If I'm going to be forced
to watch television, may I smoke?

814
01:43:31,336 --> 01:43:33,464
Yes. Give him his cigarettes.

815
01:43:33,589 --> 01:43:37,134
It won't be the nicotine
that kills you, Mr Bond.

816
01:43:54,568 --> 01:43:57,112
Armed guards to control room.

817
01:44:12,002 --> 01:44:14,296
- Close the crater.
- Close crater!

818
01:44:14,421 --> 01:44:18,008
I shall look forward personally
to exterminating you, Mr Bond.

819
01:45:15,357 --> 01:45:17,109
Close the shutters.

820
01:45:25,576 --> 01:45:27,870
We are now impregnable.

821
01:45:28,078 --> 01:45:31,874
Interception takes place in eight minutes.
Nothing can prevent that.

822
01:47:00,587 --> 01:47:03,090
Impregnable?

823
01:47:03,215 --> 01:47:06,468
- Come with me, Mr Bond.
- Bird 1 to base. Locked on target.

824
01:47:06,593 --> 01:47:09,263
- Osato?
- Yes, Number One?

825
01:47:10,889 --> 01:47:12,975
Base calling Bird 1.

826
01:47:13,142 --> 01:47:16,436
You are to assume full control
of operation from now on.

827
01:47:16,562 --> 01:47:18,605
Seven minutes to interception.

828
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:20,774
Roger, Base One.

829
01:47:21,483 --> 01:47:23,277
Houston, this is Hawaii.

830
01:47:23,402 --> 01:47:25,445
We have an unidentified object on scope.

831
01:47:25,571 --> 01:47:27,906
Order first alert. Arm all weapons.

832
01:47:28,031 --> 01:47:30,784
Interception will occur in six minutes.

833
01:47:37,749 --> 01:47:40,919
This is the price of failure, Mr Bond.

834
01:47:46,633 --> 01:47:48,677
Come on.

835
01:47:59,062 --> 01:48:01,273
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

836
01:48:11,742 --> 01:48:15,871
There's an exploder button in the
control room. We've got to get up there.

837
01:48:15,996 --> 01:48:18,040
Impossible. Too well defended.

838
01:48:23,879 --> 01:48:25,923
Evacuate the control!

839
01:48:26,423 --> 01:48:27,883
Evacuate the control!

840
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:52,074
Control room technicians.
There must be another way up there.

841
01:49:03,752 --> 01:49:05,963
Give me cover till I get to the staircase.

842
01:50:51,276 --> 01:50:53,278
Bon appétit.

843
01:51:09,545 --> 01:51:12,381
Closing fast on our vehicle.
Orbit identical.

844
01:51:13,006 --> 01:51:16,510
All units stand by for codeword.
Codeword is imminent.

845
01:51:16,635 --> 01:51:19,429
I repeat, closing fast on our vehicle.

846
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:51,545
It's blown up! The enemy!

847
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:54,131
I repeat, the enemy has blown up.

848
01:51:54,256 --> 01:51:56,717
All units will return to first alert.

849
01:51:56,842 --> 01:52:00,179
Codeword is not -
I say again, not - imminent.

850
01:52:03,557 --> 01:52:05,517
Tiger,

851
01:52:05,601 --> 01:52:06,894
we've done it.

852
01:52:26,455 --> 01:52:28,874
Down the tunnel!

853
01:53:50,456 --> 01:53:52,499
Steady.

854
01:54:07,723 --> 01:54:10,392
Now... about that honeymoon.

855
01:54:10,517 --> 01:54:12,561
Why not?

856
01:54:12,686 --> 01:54:14,938
But they'll never let you stay.

857
01:54:16,148 --> 01:54:18,192
But they'll never find us.

858
01:54:44,718 --> 01:54:48,305
- Dinghy's on board, sir.
- Tell him to come below and report.

859
01:54:48,472 --> 01:54:50,891
It'll be a pleasure, sir.
