<i>Episode 14</i>

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,928
My husband has been
beating me for 10 years.

4
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:15,738
'I'm sure he won't do it again.'
'It'll be better tomorrow.'

5
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,047
<i>My husband is an orthopedic doctor.</i>

6
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,758
<i>He hits with such calculating precision.</i>

7
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:24,728
It's time to reflect, right?

8
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:32,188
What do you mean domestic abuse?
Do you have evidence that I abused her?

9
00:00:33,308 --> 00:00:37,177
There is no one in this world
who loves my wife more than I do.

10
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:39,977
If it was to the point that their
child couldn't hear her scream...

11
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:43,028
We need to find a person
who witnessed the abuse.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,844
Lawyer So,

13
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:50,752
Look.

14
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,329
- Run!
- Stop right there!

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,950
Stop! No!

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,219
Pi Hae Young! Pi Hae Young.

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,999
Pi Hae Young!

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,520
- No! No!
- Pi Hae Young!

19
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,679
Mr. Han Dae Man!

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,010
<i>Mr. Han Dae Man!</i>

21
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,780
Go Cheok Hee!

22
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,110
Sir!

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,810
What happened?

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,410
That lady did it.

25
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,859
You have been caught in the act.
You are under arrest.

26
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,089
You may obtain a lawyer, and you
have the right to refuse testimony.

27
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,889
Cuff her.

28
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:55,539
<i>[Let's just love]</i>

29
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:58,682
Did you see Mr. Han Dae Man get
hit by the trophy you threw at him?

30
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:05,402
No. After I threw it, I came out
and he was already passed out.

31
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,391
So, you didn't see him get hit?

32
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:10,191
Yes.

33
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:13,361
What is his condition right now?

34
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:15,792
He is unconscious.

35
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:20,081
Wait... what about the
witness's testimony?

36
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:22,451
That family's child said
she saw the scene of the crime...

37
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,752
<i>Stop right there!</i>

38
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:26,692
Pi Hae Young!

39
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:30,061
Pi Hae Young!

40
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,481
No! No! No!

41
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:34,182
Pi Hae Young!

42
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:38,271
<i>The little girl said Mr. Han Dae Man
came out of the room</i>

43
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:41,322
<i>and she saw him pass out from the trophy
Ms. Go Cheok Hee threw at him.</i>

44
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,422
<i>- What about Ms. Pi Hae Young?
- She said she didn't see anything.</i>

45
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:46,382
Cho Reung!

46
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:48,571
<i>She was too busy running away
from Mr. Han Dae Man</i>

47
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:51,661
<i>until she realized she left without her
daughter, so she went back to get her.</i>

48
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:54,282
<i>By that time, her husband was
already passed out on the floor.</i>

49
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:00,351
Please get up.

50
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:02,342
Wait! Wait!

51
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:04,581
How can you arrest her
without any other evidence?

52
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:06,871
Are you just going to take
the word of an 8-year-old girl?

53
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,841
You know very well children can
change their story as much they want!

54
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:13,191
Even so, there is also no evidence.
That proves she isn't the culprit.

55
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,891
We have no choice.

56
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:17,642
Detective! Detective!

57
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:31,612
Hang in there. I'll do whatever
I can to take care of this.

58
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,611
Cheok Hee!

59
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:38,361
Cheok Hee, what happened?

60
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,021
Dad.

61
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:44,171
- Why are you in there?
- It's not a big deal, Dad.

62
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:46,941
This happens once in a while
when I take on a case.

63
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:48,381
You brat.

64
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:53,302
Mr. So, will this girl be okay?
Will she be able to come out?

65
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:58,371
So Jung Woo, I'm sorry,
but please take my dad home.

66
00:04:58,372 --> 00:05:01,762
I'm not going anywhere! How can I leave
when you're in here? I'm not going!

67
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:04,532
Send him home. Huh?

68
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:07,392
Cheok Hee!

69
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:18,982
Let go!

70
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:23,901
She'll be more concerned
if you stay here, sir.

71
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:27,741
What if she ends up going to jail?

72
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,961
No arrest warrant will be issued
as long as we find evidence

73
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,611
that proves she is not the culprit.

74
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:34,281
Don't worry. Please trust me
to take care of this. Go home now.

75
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:36,442
- Okay.
- Thank you.

76
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:45,452
Ms. Mi Hwa.

77
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:48,791
Soo Ah!
What brings you here?

78
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,211
Your favorite, spicy rice cakes!

79
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:53,202
It made me think of you,
so I bought some.

80
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:00,061
I'm going to go.

81
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:02,531
You came all the way here carrying this.

82
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:04,331
Are you going somewhere?

83
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:06,941
Jung Woo is staying overnight
at the police station.

84
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:08,781
I was going to take some clothes to him.

85
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,311
The police station?

86
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:13,241
If it's the Gangnam police station,
it's close to where you live, right?

87
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,711
Yes.

88
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:18,932
Then on your way...
go ahead and take this to him.

89
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:28,932
He left.

90
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:34,812
Thanks... You go home too.

91
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,521
- Go Cheok Hee.
- Go.

92
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,382
How can I go when you're here?

93
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:45,092
If it's that uncomfortable for you...

94
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,101
Fine then, I'll go.

95
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:51,902
But... I'll go after this case is over.

96
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,352
So Jung Woo.

97
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:59,371
I swear it. I'll really
leave after it's over.

98
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:03,842
Let me be next to you until then.

99
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:32,122
Jung Woo.

100
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:40,592
Soo Ah.

101
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:44,811
How did you know to come here?

102
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:48,791
I went to your house, and Ms. Mi Hwa
asked me to take this to you. Here.

103
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:52,242
Man, why did she make you do this?

104
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:55,422
I have to go in right now.
What should I do?

105
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,662
Go in.

106
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:01,101
I made you run around for nothing.
I'm so sorry.

107
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:03,311
It's fine. Just treat me
to a meal next time.

108
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:06,972
- Okay. Thanks, I'm going to go. Bye.
- Sure.

109
00:08:37,502 --> 00:08:39,192
Hey, Lawyer Jo.

110
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:44,612
What? Go Cheok Hee is
in the police station?

111
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:48,632
Do you think Mr. Han Dae Man
will be okay?

112
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,682
- I hear he is still unconscious.
- Don't worry.

113
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:53,802
I have every faith he will wake up.

114
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:58,742
For three years, I waited for the day
my suspension would be lifted.

115
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,552
If I get sentenced to prison...

116
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:04,761
I'll be permanently banned this time.

117
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:06,711
It wasn't deliberate.

118
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,501
Not to mention, there isn't any
clear evidence that proves you did it.

119
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:12,222
I'll do whatever I can to prevent you
from getting sentenced to jail.

120
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,202
Just trust me.

121
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:18,552
Go Cheok Hee.

122
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:24,022
- Cheok Hee.
- How did you know I was here?

123
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:26,692
Are you all right?

124
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,412
I'm fine.

125
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,152
Min Kyu!

126
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:41,211
Just how are you handling the situation?

127
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:44,962
You should be the one in jail!
Why is Go Cheok Hee in here?

128
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,072
Hit me again.

129
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:52,752
What?

130
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,291
It kills me that she's in here
instead of me

131
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,092
so go ahead and hit me again!

132
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,232
What's the condition of the victim?

133
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:07,512
He's unconscious.

134
00:10:08,862 --> 00:10:12,842
Then our first priority is for
the victim to gain consciousness.

135
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,771
In that way, we can try to make
some sort of settlement.

136
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:17,332
It's still too early to determine
that Manager Go is the culprit.

137
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,422
She only threw the trophy.

138
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:23,161
She said she didn't
see him get hit by it.

139
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:25,381
I'm sure I did it.

140
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:27,422
I was the only one there.

141
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:29,921
Don't worry, Go Cheok Hee.

142
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,171
I'll gather every skilled doctor
in the world if I have to.

143
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:35,401
I'll make sure that punk
wakes up in 48 hours.

144
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,962
And don't blame yourself.

145
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:40,262
The fingerprints and the results
of the blood exam aren't out yet.

146
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:43,402
It might not be you.

147
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:52,721
Dr. Kim, Dr. Park, Dr. Choi,
Dr. Lee, Dr. Wang.

148
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:54,831
For what reason did you
call all of us here...

149
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:57,091
- Have you seen patient Han Dae Man?
- Yes.

150
00:10:57,092 --> 00:11:00,461
There is some bleeding in the brain,
but it's not in a dangerous region.

151
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:03,291
Fortunately, surgery won't be necessary.

152
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:04,511
Good.

153
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:07,681
According to the neurology exam,
there are no abnormal reports.

154
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:11,271
We can't predict how long it will
take for him to regain consciousness.

155
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:13,381
- You must wake him up at all cost.
- Director Bong.

156
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:17,271
I will no longer ask about his
condition or what the prospects are.

157
00:11:17,272 --> 00:11:19,551
Just make sure he wakes up.

158
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:22,161
- Well...
- I won't listen to any explanations

159
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:24,092
nor any excuses.

160
00:11:24,742 --> 00:11:26,611
Wake him up.

161
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:30,421
Use whatever necessary medication
and hire more doctors if needed.

162
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:31,621
Yes, sir.

163
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:33,502
If you see any signs of improvement...

164
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:37,432
- Please call me right away.
- I understand.

165
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:01,412
How is Cheok Hee doing?

166
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,982
Well, she acts like she's fine.

167
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,212
Hold on... where is the study?

168
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:17,502
I think it's over there.

169
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:31,522
In all my years, I can't believe
I'm worried about Cheok Hee.

170
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:52,682
- Kyung.
- Yes?

171
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,642
Throw a trophy from there.

172
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,282
One more.

173
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:14,712
Are we good?

174
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,522
What is it?

175
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:23,271
It should fall over here,
but it keeps going over there.

176
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:25,741
How strong can Cheok Hee be?

177
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:27,582
Maybe she wasn't strong enough.

178
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:34,541
Hey, Yoo Mi.

179
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,581
The results of the blood exam are out.

180
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,401
The blood on the trophy
matches Mr. Han Dae Man's blood.

181
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,101
<i>- What about the fingerprints?</i>
- The fingerprints...

182
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,361
Cheok Hee's fingerprints and
Mr. Han Dae Man's fingerprints

183
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:47,071
were both on the trophy.

184
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:52,111
Also... I overheard
the detectives talking...

185
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:56,252
Judging from the shape and angle
of Mr. Han Dae Man's injury...

186
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:01,762
They're saying it's
most likely the trophy.

187
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:07,372
Yes.

188
00:14:08,272 --> 00:14:09,892
Okay.

189
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:15,162
Jung Woo, the detectives are
saying that he got hit by the trophy.

190
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:17,942
Let's go for now.

191
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:52,182
What is that?

192
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:54,452
I'm not sure.

193
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,821
Ah, it's that! It's the safety pin!

194
00:14:57,822 --> 00:15:00,642
- A safety pin?
- It goes into the fire extinguisher.

195
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,512
How are you doing in there?

196
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:48,291
All I'm doing is sitting.

197
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:51,642
That's the hardest thing for you.

198
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:54,452
Just sitting.

199
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:58,632
Go Cheok Hee.

200
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:04,922
Cheok Hee.

201
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:08,501
Yes?

202
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:11,082
Because you're in there...

203
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:14,832
Now I know.

204
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:19,992
Whether you hate me
or try to push me away...

205
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:22,831
that's not important.

206
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,652
I just...

207
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:31,822
I just want you out of there.

208
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:40,942
Think of it as if you're outside.

209
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:45,202
- What?
- I'm the who's locked up.

210
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:53,032
Where you are right now...
just think of it as if you're outside.

211
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,482
Have you found anything?

212
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:43,172
Not yet.

213
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,672
Cheok Hee.

214
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:04,122
Did you even get any sleep
on this stone floor?

215
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:07,542
Strangely, I slept really well.

216
00:18:08,952 --> 00:18:11,322
It's as if my mom put me to sleep.

217
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:21,422
Yes, Dr. Kim?

218
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:27,972
Pardon? Yes, I'll head to
the hospital right now. Bye.

219
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:32,512
Cheok Hee, Mr. Han Dae Man briefly
gained consciousness in the morning.

220
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:33,741
Really?

221
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:37,931
If he wakes up, I'm going make a deal
and settle it once and for all.

222
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:40,912
- Don't worry and stay put.
- Thanks, Min Kyu.

223
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:42,852
Sure.

224
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:06,232
Three...

225
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:14,492
There were clearly
five trophies back then.

226
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:20,301
Out of the five, three are here.

227
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:24,532
One is in the crime laboratory.
Then where is the last one?

228
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:42,272
Go Cheok Hee, how many
trophies did you throw?

229
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:44,571
One.

230
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:47,562
- You haven't touched anything else?
- No.

231
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:49,942
I have to go.
I'll be back.

232
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,281
There were originally
five trophies here.

233
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:12,551
Two trophies are gone,
but Cheok Hee said she only threw one.

234
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:15,491
If that's the case, the trophy that
was at the scene of the crime...

235
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:17,781
What if there is a possibility
that Cheok Hee didn't throw it?

236
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:21,002
But Cheok Hee's fingerprints were on it.

237
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:27,711
She could've touched that trophy
after the crime occurred.

238
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:30,502
Then where did the last one go?

239
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,631
That's what I'm saying.

240
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:36,592
That's what I'm saying.
Let's try to find that missing trophy.

241
00:20:57,782 --> 00:20:59,652
I don't think it's here.

242
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:02,512
Let's check the bedrooms.

243
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:42,402
Jung... Jung Woo.

244
00:21:57,112 --> 00:22:00,531
Kyung... I'm going to
head out to see Cho Reung.

245
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:03,771
Call the lead detective and tell
him we found new evidence, okay?

246
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,131
- Okay.
- One more thing.

247
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:08,402
- Get the fingerprints.
- Okay.

248
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:21,682
What brings you here?

249
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,522
I was hoping I could get a chance
to talk to Cho Reung for a brief moment.

250
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:33,641
Please make it quick.
She has to go to cram school.

251
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:34,892
I will.

252
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,242
I'm just curious about something.

253
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:48,272
You said you saw your dad get
hit by the trophy that day, right?

254
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:50,721
Yes.

255
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:55,861
Besides the trophy that lady threw,
have you seen a different trophy at all?

256
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:59,092
What? No!

257
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:04,702
That lady didn't throw that trophy, I...

258
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:08,751
No, I don't know.
I don't remember.

259
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,422
What did you say?

260
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:15,351
- Mom, I don't like this guy.
- Cho Reung...

261
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,951
Please stop,
you're hurting her feelings.

262
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:20,742
- Good bye.
- Wait...

263
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:27,682
- Wait a minute.
- She's late for class. I'm sorry.

264
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:52,142
Jung... Jung Woo.

265
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:03,631
- Hey, Kyung.
- Jung Woo, about that trophy.

266
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:07,251
The results are out. Cheok Hee's and
Cho Reung's fingerprints were on it.

267
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:08,722
What?

268
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,091
- Goodness, President Bong, you're here.
- Hello, sir.

269
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:20,401
What happened?
Is Mr. Han Dae Man awake?

270
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:25,412
Not yet. He has to regain complete
consciousness in order to talk.

271
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,412
It's going to take some time.

272
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:32,921
The warrant is going
to come out in an hour.

273
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:38,261
What's going to happen to our Cheok Hee?
Are they going to lock her away?

274
00:24:38,262 --> 00:24:39,732
Don't worry, sir.

275
00:24:39,742 --> 00:24:43,652
Even if she does get arrested, I'm going
to get her out by any means necessary.

276
00:24:56,592 --> 00:25:00,182
- See you soon.
- Be careful.

277
00:25:15,892 --> 00:25:18,041
How did you get here?

278
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:20,691
- May I see the fire extinguisher?
- Excuse me?

279
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:23,442
Why?

280
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:37,872
Ms. Pi Hae Young, do you have anything
to say about this fire extinguisher?

281
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:40,911
Run!

282
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:42,831
<i>As soon as your husband started
to get violent that day...</i>

283
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,942
<i>you called Go Cheok Hee for help.</i>

284
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:48,991
Pi Hae Young.

285
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:50,481
- Pi Hae Young.
- No!

286
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:54,362
<i>Thanks to Go Cheok Hee,
you had an opportunity to run away.</i>

287
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:56,811
<i>As you ran outside,
you discovered the fire extinguisher</i>

288
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:58,202
<i>and you changed your mind.</i>

289
00:25:59,902 --> 00:26:02,471
<i>The trophy Go Cheok Hee
tried to save you with</i>

290
00:26:02,472 --> 00:26:04,501
<i>did not make contact
with Mr. Han Dae Man.</i>

291
00:26:04,502 --> 00:26:06,112
<i>It fell in front of Cho Reung's room.</i>

292
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:09,301
<i>Right away...</i>

293
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:12,132
<i>you struck Mr. Han Dae Man's head
with the fire extinguisher.</i>

294
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:23,902
<i>Surprisingly, there was a similar trophy
near where Mr. Han Dae Man passed out.</i>

295
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:28,382
<i>Go Cheok Hee mistook that trophy
for the actual trophy she threw.</i>

296
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:47,202
<i>After you ran away...</i>

297
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:50,391
<i>There was only one person
who witnessed this whole fact.</i>

298
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:54,341
<i>Cho Reung was probably confused.</i>

299
00:26:54,342 --> 00:26:55,611
Mr. Han Dae Man!

300
00:26:55,612 --> 00:27:01,382
<i>So out of fear and concern,
she decided to hide it.</i>

301
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:06,652
The trophy Cho Reung hid...

302
00:27:07,832 --> 00:27:11,002
was tucked between the mattress.

303
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:13,242
What are you talking about?

304
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:16,472
Just as you wanted to protect
your child from domestic violence...

305
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:20,101
Cho Reung was also trying
to protect her own mother.

306
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:21,842
Nevertheless...

307
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:26,282
are you just going to stand by and
let an innocent person take the fall?

308
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:27,841
You more than anyone else...

309
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:30,142
hoped your daughter would grow up
to be an upright person!

310
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:33,112
<i>Please stop.</i>

311
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:38,532
- Don't take my mom away!
- Cho Reung!

312
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:43,561
I hate you, mister!
Don't make my mom cry!

313
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,352
Cho Reung, come here.

314
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:52,172
Mom, don't cry!
I hate seeing you cry!

315
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:56,492
The truth is,
I heard everything in my room.

316
00:27:57,472 --> 00:28:00,972
I heard you cry after Dad got mad.

317
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:03,991
What?

318
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:07,522
Do you know how sad I was
whenever that happened?

319
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:10,962
So don't cry, Mom.

320
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:18,061
I won't cry. I won't cry.
I'm sorry, Cho Reung.

321
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:21,562
I am so sorry.

322
00:28:27,212 --> 00:28:30,812
Cho Reung, I am so sorry.

323
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:34,742
The arrest warrant must be out.

324
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:38,022
Ms. Go Cheok Hee, please come out.

325
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:43,262
Goodness, what are we going to do?

326
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:46,562
Cheok Hee, don't worry
and stay put, okay?

327
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:49,631
Ms. Pi Hae Young confessed
a little while ago.

328
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:52,032
She said she struck Mr. Han Dae Man
with a fire extinguisher.

329
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:54,792
What?

330
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:57,961
What just happened?

331
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:59,851
Are you serious?

332
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:01,731
Why did she suddenly confess?

333
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:04,342
The charges have been cleared,
so you're free to go.

334
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:08,942
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!

335
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:13,532
Thank you!
Thank you, President Bong!

336
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,532
You're out.

337
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:32,242
They said Ms. Pi Hae Young confessed.

338
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:36,642
That's great.

339
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:44,412
Then like I promised...

340
00:29:46,762 --> 00:29:49,172
I have to leave, right?

341
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:54,312
Right.

342
00:29:55,342 --> 00:29:57,362
Thanks for everything.

343
00:30:07,232 --> 00:30:08,932
Mr. So is here.

344
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:13,562
Now you're here.

345
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,121
Cheok Hee, let's go.

346
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:21,032
You've went through a lot.
Let's get you a proper meal to eat.

347
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:23,731
Goodness, yes.

348
00:30:23,732 --> 00:30:25,201
Goodbye, sir.

349
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:29,162
You too, Mr. So.
Take care of yourself.

350
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:34,272
Let's go. Goodbye.
Let's go.

351
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:53,782
Let's go.

352
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,612
Cheers.

353
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:18,871
- Good job, Jung Woo.
- You too.

354
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:21,962
Everything turned out well.
Why do you look so down?

355
00:31:25,202 --> 00:31:26,602
Kyung.

356
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:31,782
The way I like someone...

357
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:38,022
I thought I was supposed to
express everything in my heart.

358
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,922
I was wrong.

359
00:31:43,222 --> 00:31:47,892
I guess it could make that person
feel more uncomfortable.

360
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:50,961
Don't talk about Go Cheok Hee.

361
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:53,321
How could you fall for that woman?

362
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:55,112
You're right.

363
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:59,022
I've completely fallen for her.

364
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:03,342
That's why it's hard to let her go.

365
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:07,491
Jung Woo, set your mind to it and end it.

366
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,291
Like when you first came to the office.

367
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:12,572
You're the lawyer and Cheok Hee
is just the office manager, okay?

368
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:30,132
You're here.

369
00:32:33,142 --> 00:32:34,912
Who are they?

370
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,721
She's been making tofu
for 50 years in Chodang.

371
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:42,362
I brought a tofu artisan.
This is her daughter-in-law.

372
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:47,012
Are all these tofu?

373
00:32:47,022 --> 00:32:48,081
We didn't know what you liked

374
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:50,341
so we prepared
a variety of different tofus.

375
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:53,751
This is black bean tofu
and this is firm tofu.

376
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:57,291
President Bong, I don't know
what to say. You are too kind.

377
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:01,002
When Mi Hee was at the police station,
he took care of the settlement money...

378
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:04,021
What do you mean?

379
00:33:04,022 --> 00:33:07,332
- No, nevermind.
- What do you mean?

380
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:10,801
Cheok Hee, it wasn't that much.

381
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:14,701
Dad! How could you
accept Min Kyu's money?

382
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:18,891
Cheok Hee, it wasn't your dad's fault.
It was my fault.

383
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:22,021
Of all days, I had money on me
at the time. I had no choice.

384
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:24,881
Seriously, I can't believe you!

385
00:33:24,882 --> 00:33:27,711
Cheok Hee, don't hurt their feelings.
They went out of their way to come.

386
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:32,041
First... have a bite and
let's not ever go there again.

387
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:34,862
- Here.
- I swear!

388
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:48,112
Just a moment please.

389
00:34:06,572 --> 00:34:08,942
- You came to work.
- Huh?

390
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,602
Yes.

391
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:16,241
Mr. Han Dae Man's condition
has gotten much better.

392
00:34:16,242 --> 00:34:20,922
I'm glad. Ms. Pi Hae Young's act of
self-defense should be accepted then.

393
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:24,452
Depending upon
Mr. Han Dae Man's condition...

394
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:27,491
Please submit the divorce petition.

395
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:30,812
Oh... yes, sir.

396
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:39,681
I keep forgetting to
change the passcode.

397
00:34:39,682 --> 00:34:41,272
I'll keep it short, and then I'm off.

398
00:34:41,282 --> 00:34:44,601
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m. in
the sapphire room of the DK Hotel.

399
00:34:44,602 --> 00:34:47,901
You said there's addition and
multiplication in your life

400
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,471
but there is no division
or subtraction, correct?

401
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:52,391
I must take after you
more than I thought.

402
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:56,842
I only go forward in my life.
There are no u-turns.

403
00:34:58,402 --> 00:35:00,471
Today is the last day.
I'm going easy on you!

404
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:04,051
I never denied you anything because
you had to grow up with your mother.

405
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:07,082
Can't you go easy on me just this once?

406
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:09,692
What?

407
00:35:11,182 --> 00:35:13,212
Instead of loving things
like buildings...

408
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,682
can't you love your son just this once?

409
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,922
I've said too much.

410
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:26,222
I let my emotions get the best of me.

411
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:33,131
Your house, buildings, cars, and land.

412
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:37,891
Everything you own can disappear
with just a word from me.

413
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:42,842
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m. in
the Sapphire Room of the DK Hotel.

414
00:35:52,262 --> 00:35:55,261
4.5 million won a month with
a 30 million won deposit.

415
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:57,671
3 million won a month with
a 50 million won deposit...

416
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:01,102
Wow, why is it so expensive?

417
00:36:03,092 --> 00:36:07,902
I won't be able to sign a lease
even if my suspension gets lifted.

418
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:16,131
Have you come to threaten me too?

419
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,381
- Was someone here?
- Yes.

420
00:36:18,382 --> 00:36:20,682
The patriarch of this family.
Your boss.

421
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:27,652
It's the rent money for the penthouse.
I'm going to have to stay longer.

422
00:36:29,702 --> 00:36:31,571
Don't pay me back with money.

423
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:34,182
- Pay me back with advice.
- What kind of advice?

424
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,992
Go Cheok Hee's suspension
will be lifted in several days.

425
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:40,972
So... I'm thinking of proposing to her.

426
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:43,971
- Really?
- They broke up.

427
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:46,172
Shouldn't I jump at this opportunity?

428
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:50,982
The location...
where would be a good place?

429
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:55,831
I'm not sure. Women normally
like big and fancy things.

430
00:36:55,832 --> 00:36:59,262
Plus, it's even better if the
location was meant just for her.

431
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:04,362
A location just for her.

432
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:09,762
You.

433
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:15,092
Dad.

434
00:37:15,892 --> 00:37:18,171
Do you have some money on you?

435
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:21,662
Where? I don't even have money
to leave behind when I die.

436
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:29,232
Why? Do you need money?

437
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:33,361
I want to open my own practice
once the suspension lifts.

438
00:37:33,362 --> 00:37:37,152
Can't you just work as
a lawyer at that firm?

439
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,502
There is someone
I shouldn't be running into.

440
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:45,862
If he's good to me, I get concerned.

441
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:50,142
If he's cold to me, it breaks my heart.

442
00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:54,282
It's just better not to see him.

443
00:37:58,352 --> 00:38:00,992
What should we do?

444
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:15,331
The traffic in Gangnam
lately isn't so bad.

445
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:19,122
This rascal always takes
the Olympic highway.

446
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:24,392
It seems this is the end of
DK and BF's relationship.

447
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,202
Let's go.

448
00:38:29,612 --> 00:38:30,681
President Lee.

449
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:33,681
If you're concerned about a lawsuit,
I'm sure BF is sick and tired of it.

450
00:38:33,682 --> 00:38:35,821
Let's make this quick and simple.

451
00:38:35,822 --> 00:38:38,851
When will you return
the property in Seocho-dong?

452
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:42,251
He has a tender heart.
It's only because he thinks too much.

453
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:44,601
- Please let go of your anger...
- If you come out like this...

454
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,891
We'll have to take you to court.

455
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,921
I had no idea we would
go to court for this.

456
00:38:49,922 --> 00:38:50,922
If that's what you want,
then let's go ahead and do that.

457
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:55,861
The media will go into a frenzy,
but it's better to end it cleanly.

458
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:59,191
- President Lee...
- You should've done one or the other.

459
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:01,171
You should've been more discrete
before the building went up.

460
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,232
Or you should've
handled your son better.

461
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:07,962
I'll call you after you've been served.

462
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:10,182
Let's go.

463
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:21,552
Yes, Director?

464
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:24,321
Real estate, stocks, investment funds...

465
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:26,741
Investigate everything that's
under Bong Min Kyu's name.

466
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,141
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- What about my will?

467
00:39:29,142 --> 00:39:32,012
- Bring that as well.
- Even the will?

468
00:39:32,022 --> 00:39:33,571
When is the completion
date for the new building?

469
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:34,862
In October, sir.

470
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:39,771
I also want to know
the official value of it.

471
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:41,472
Yes, sir.

472
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:50,592
Pick one out.
I'll buy it for you.

473
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,832
Why are you buying me a gift?

474
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:59,252
About Mi Hee's settlement money...

475
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:02,401
I won't be able to pay
you back immediately.

476
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:05,512
Accept the gift for now
and give me an extension.

477
00:40:06,962 --> 00:40:09,061
Well, if that's what you really want.

478
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:10,831
Thanks.

479
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:15,802
Okay, pick something out.
I know you only wear clothes from here.

480
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:19,482
<i>[12 million won]</i>

481
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:28,532
What should I get?

482
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:35,941
Socks. Socks.

483
00:40:35,942 --> 00:40:38,722
- I need socks.
- Socks?

484
00:40:39,222 --> 00:40:41,861
- Seriously?
- Yes.

485
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:45,452
I don't have any red socks, so it hasn't
been very fun wearing clothes lately.

486
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:49,682
- This one is nice.
- Are you sure socks will be enough?

487
00:40:49,692 --> 00:40:50,832
Yes.

488
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,402
- Can I wear this?
- Yes.

489
00:40:58,202 --> 00:41:00,862
Have you taken care of the
situation at the police station?

490
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:03,532
Yes.

491
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:07,501
I was so busy that day, I didn't
even greet you properly. Sorry.

492
00:41:07,502 --> 00:41:09,511
I'm getting a nice steak dinner
for bringing your clothes.

493
00:41:09,512 --> 00:41:11,622
I don't think I suffered any losses.

494
00:41:21,742 --> 00:41:23,652
Who is this?

495
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:29,712
Lawyer Bong.

496
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:46,312
Lawyer So, do you know this?

497
00:41:46,912 --> 00:41:49,452
If it's made from a G7 nation...

498
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,062
The quality of the socks
is also quite different.

499
00:41:57,252 --> 00:41:59,212
Please pass the ketchup.

500
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:04,922
Am I wrong? Maybe it's so fine
because you bought it for me.

501
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:06,911
Min Kyu.

502
00:42:06,912 --> 00:42:09,231
Why is this so sticky?
What's up with this?

503
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:13,562
Are you two out on a date?
Have you exchanged gifts as well?

504
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:18,572
- It's not that...
- Seriously, what is wrong with this?

505
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:23,472
It seems you two are
the ones out on a date.

506
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:25,881
Just the two of you in
this nice restaurant.

507
00:42:25,882 --> 00:42:29,161
Well, it just happened.

508
00:42:29,162 --> 00:42:34,742
I noticed you two looked
very good together walking in.

509
00:42:35,342 --> 00:42:38,032
Is this red pepper paste? Come on.

510
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:44,772
Lawyer So!

511
00:42:47,082 --> 00:42:49,202
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?

512
00:42:50,812 --> 00:42:52,471
Fortunately, the socks are fine.

513
00:42:52,472 --> 00:42:54,761
Cheok Hee, I'll be back.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

514
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:56,221
Okay.

515
00:42:56,222 --> 00:42:58,952
Be careful, will you?

516
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:04,362
What a relief.

517
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:13,582
I heard your suspension period
will be expiring soon.

518
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:20,431
I don't think I need to tell you
about my personal life.

519
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:23,832
Are you going to keep
working at that firm?

520
00:43:24,422 --> 00:43:27,592
That office doesn't
need additional lawyers.

521
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:31,932
I've been looking around for office space
so I could open up my own firm.

522
00:43:35,592 --> 00:43:37,941
Are you free tomorrow?

523
00:43:37,942 --> 00:43:39,442
What?

524
00:43:41,562 --> 00:43:45,031
The color is close to colorless.
A level D.

525
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:47,632
The clarity is amazing.

526
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:50,251
The diamond is internally flawless, sir.

527
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,372
You said you're also
a certified jewelry appraiser.

528
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:55,171
As I expected, your expertise
is beyond impressive.

529
00:43:55,172 --> 00:43:56,421
Thank you.

530
00:43:56,422 --> 00:43:58,091
- I'll take it.
- Yes, sir.

531
00:43:58,092 --> 00:44:00,351
Shall I cancel the one we saw earlier?

532
00:44:00,352 --> 00:44:03,551
- I'm going to get both.
- Excuse me?

533
00:44:03,552 --> 00:44:07,051
I still don't know what
Cheok Hee really likes.

534
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:09,802
I'm going to buy a variety
and have her pick one.

535
00:44:14,802 --> 00:44:19,562
Director, where is this
rancid smell coming from?

536
00:44:22,262 --> 00:44:23,842
I'm sorry.

537
00:44:25,922 --> 00:44:28,112
I've been wearing these
socks for several days.

538
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:31,861
You never wear the same
pair of socks twice.

539
00:44:31,862 --> 00:44:33,262
How could you wear
the same pair of socks?

540
00:44:33,302 --> 00:44:36,251
These are not the type of socks you
throw away after wearing once!

541
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:38,651
If you take it off, I can at
least have it dry cleaned for you.

542
00:44:38,652 --> 00:44:40,312
No, I don't want to.

543
00:44:41,322 --> 00:44:44,071
- Here you go.
- Ah yes, thank you.

544
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:46,532
Let's go see the next ring.

545
00:44:50,872 --> 00:44:53,022
You didn't smell anything?

546
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:03,712
Some new blinds and it's pretty
much ready. What do you think?

547
00:45:05,532 --> 00:45:08,591
What's your reason for
showing me this place?

548
00:45:08,592 --> 00:45:10,601
You said you were looking
for an office space.

549
00:45:10,602 --> 00:45:14,061
I planned on using this space for
my own firm, but something came up.

550
00:45:14,062 --> 00:45:18,281
If you looked around, you know
it's hard to find a place like this.

551
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:22,211
Exactly. Why are you
looking for my office space?

552
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:25,371
Because I think we feel the same way.

553
00:45:25,372 --> 00:45:27,992
You feel uncomfortable
being with Jung Woo.

554
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:31,232
I also feel uncomfortable
when you're with Jung Woo.

555
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:34,551
I already paid the down payment.

556
00:45:34,552 --> 00:45:37,561
If you don't have the means
right now, you can pay me later.

557
00:45:37,562 --> 00:45:39,332
Think about it.

558
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:47,102
I'll take it.

559
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:53,122

Something that gave you
good memories once...

563
00:46:45,862 --> 00:46:50,522
will happen again someday.

564
00:46:53,502 --> 00:46:55,852
It happened,
just like you said it would.

565
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:01,822
It's eel juice.
Drink it.

566
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:05,222
It should help you regain some
the energy you lost earlier.

567
00:47:06,482 --> 00:47:07,902

What's with the look on your face?

571
00:47:18,552 --> 00:47:21,342
Are you sure you're free
to practice law again?

572
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:25,801
It's so strange. I thought I was
going to be so happy today.

573
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:29,791
I'm more depressed than when
I got my license suspended.

574
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:32,831
That's weird. Why?

575
00:47:32,832 --> 00:47:36,042
If I think about it...

576
00:47:37,102 --> 00:47:39,922
instead of the six years
I worked as a lawyer...

577
00:47:40,712 --> 00:47:46,242
I was much happier during my
brief time as an office manager.

578
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:51,902
I learned a lot... I fought a lot...

- and I liked them a lot.
- You brat.

580
00:47:58,302 --> 00:48:01,921
You really enjoyed working there.
Will you be able to leave?

581
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:04,612
I have to.

582
00:48:05,312 --> 00:48:08,912
I'm going to go and pack
my belongings tonight.

583
00:48:39,412 --> 00:48:41,081
- You startled me!
- Look at it.

00:48:41,082 --> 00:48:43,301
Isn't it adorable?

Yes, yes. It's so adorable that I'm

Her desk is completely empty.

593

Come to the 'S' shopping mall

A shopping mall?

607
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:54,222
I told you.

608
00:51:54,832 --> 00:51:56,861
The best part about meeting you

609
00:51:56,862 --> 00:51:59,392
is exactly this.

610
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:03,062
The mystery of discovering things
that I've never experienced in my life.

611
00:52:28,472 --> 00:52:30,282
What is it, Ms. Yoon?

612
00:52:31,532 --> 00:52:33,411
It's nothing. I was just...

613
00:52:33,412 --> 00:52:38,652
Ah, I wanted to check
the cleanliness of our office.

614

This is what I think, Lawyer So.

00:52:47,912 --> 00:52:51,012
- What...
- If the Director is a pearl necklace...

617
00:52:51,022 --> 00:52:53,571
then Go Cheok Hee is a pig neck.

618
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:55,521
Don't you think a pearl necklace
should be placed around

619
00:52:55,522 --> 00:52:57,912
Audrey Hepburn's neck
instead of a pig's neck?

620
00:52:59,902 --> 00:53:02,142
I wonder if it already started.

621
00:53:03,632 --> 00:53:05,752
Just what are you trying to say?

622
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:07,822
It's nothing.

00:53:08,562 --> 00:53:12,461
Oh, these documents...
2 p.m. at the 'S' shopping mall.

- Who?
- I don't know.

However, if the Director
is a pearl necklace

628
00:53:24,992 --> 00:53:28,982
then I think Go Cheok is a pig's neck.

629
00:53:34,852 --> 00:53:36,842
- Where is it again?
- 'S' shopping mall!

630
00:53:42,572 --> 00:53:44,692
I never mentioned who it was.

631
00:53:45,232 --> 00:53:47,602
What did I just do?

632
00:53:48,752 --> 00:53:50,652
What do I do?

633
00:53:53,842 --> 00:53:56,272
- This is wrong.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

634
00:53:57,882 --> 00:53:59,961
- The shopping mall is closed today.
- What?

635
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:03,862
- Why all of a sudden?
- We don't know either. I'm sorry.

636
00:54:06,372 --> 00:54:08,831
I'm sorry, but we're closed
for business today.

637
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:10,211
Why?

638
00:54:10,212 --> 00:54:12,832
Some customer rented out
the whole shopping mall.

639
00:54:13,652 --> 00:54:15,712
What kind of
crazy bastard would do that?

640
00:54:44,612 --> 00:54:46,331
Cheok Hee.

641
00:54:46,332 --> 00:54:50,842
I know none of these rings are worthy
enough to put on your finger.

642
00:54:52,242 --> 00:54:57,192
Think of my sincerity
and at least put one on.

643
00:55:00,752 --> 00:55:03,172
No, you idiot.

644
00:55:08,262 --> 00:55:11,062
I didn't know what you preferred,
so this is what I prepared.

645
00:55:11,072 --> 00:55:14,562
If you see anything you like,
pick one and put it on.

646
00:55:16,832 --> 00:55:19,821
Did that come out too strong?
What do I do?

647
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:21,682
I've never done this before.

648
00:55:30,962 --> 00:55:32,612
Welcome!

649
00:55:34,482 --> 00:55:36,002
Me?

650
00:55:40,502 --> 00:55:43,721
- Where am I supposed to go?
- Go this way, ma'am.

651
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:45,422
Ah thank you.

652
00:55:47,132 --> 00:55:51,172
Is this place going out of business?
Why aren't there any customers?

653
00:56:03,772 --> 00:56:05,611
The shopping mall is closed today.

654
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,552
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry.

655
00:56:24,432 --> 00:56:26,232
This way, ma'am.

656
00:56:40,622 --> 00:56:44,312
Stop!

657
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:49,312
Stop! Shoot!

658
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:03,742
- She's on her way up, sir.
- Okay.

659
00:57:37,482 --> 00:57:39,231
Welcome, Cheok Hee.

660
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:42,151
Min Kyu, what are you doing here?

661
00:57:42,152 --> 00:57:43,952
Sit down for now.

662
00:57:49,142 --> 00:57:52,131
Why aren't there any customers here?

663
00:57:52,132 --> 00:57:54,402
I rented it out.

664
00:57:55,022 --> 00:57:56,481
You rented it?

665
00:57:56,482 --> 00:57:58,572
Why?

666
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:02,022
The thing is...

667
00:58:06,682 --> 00:58:08,181
How much are all of these rings?

668
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:11,052
They look like they're
all over a carat each!

669
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:13,262
Cheok Hee.

670
00:58:14,162 --> 00:58:16,841
Don't think about the cost of the ring.

671
00:58:16,842 --> 00:58:18,792
Think about the person who prepared...

672
00:58:18,802 --> 00:58:22,581
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...
Wow, there are 10 rings here!

673
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,171
If you ran off with this, you could
live off of them for several years.

674
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:27,411
Don't you agree? Let's say it's
about 10 million won a piece.

675
00:58:27,412 --> 00:58:30,321
No, is it over 10 million
won for a carat these days?

676
00:58:30,322 --> 00:58:33,021
Cheok Hee, that's not it...

677
00:58:33,022 --> 00:58:36,371
Is there a diamond event
going on at the shopping mall?

678
00:58:36,372 --> 00:58:38,431
Who brought all these rings here?

679
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,702
They're yours!

680
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:01,792
These rings... are mine?

681
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:05,352
Cheok Hee.

682
00:59:05,922 --> 00:59:08,421
I know none of these rings are worthy...

683
00:59:08,422 --> 00:59:15,132
No. I think I know what
you're trying to say.

684
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,292
I'm sorry. My answer...

685
00:59:20,102 --> 00:59:22,262
is no.

686
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:19,692
I swear.

687
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:34,151
Yes, hello?

688
01:00:34,152 --> 01:00:36,571
It's me, Pi Hae Young.

689
01:00:36,572 --> 01:00:40,881
- I want to apologize.
- I understand.

690
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:42,901
<i>Thank you, Manager Go.</i>

691
01:00:42,902 --> 01:00:47,122
Please give my regards
to Lawyer So as well.

692
01:00:47,752 --> 01:00:51,402
Thanks to him, I was able to confess.

693
01:00:52,422 --> 01:00:54,942
- Excuse me?
- You didn't know?

694
01:00:56,032 --> 01:01:00,542
Lawyer So sought me
out and convinced me.

695
01:01:01,452 --> 01:01:03,272
If he hadn't done that...

696
01:01:04,752 --> 01:01:07,272
I wouldn't have had
the courage to confess.

697
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:12,002
Yes. I understand.

698
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:19,032
They said Ms. Pi Hae Young confessed.

699
01:01:20,892 --> 01:01:22,462
That's great.

700
01:01:27,722 --> 01:01:29,232
So Jung Woo.

701
01:01:35,252 --> 01:01:37,022
<i>Go Cheok Hee!</i>

702
01:01:52,772 --> 01:01:54,412
<i>So Jung Woo!</i>

703
01:02:31,322 --> 01:02:34,052
- Go Cheok Hee.
- So Jung Woo.

704
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:38,112
How did you know to come here?

705
01:02:39,782 --> 01:02:41,211
I'm sorry.

706
01:02:41,212 --> 01:02:43,821
- About what?
- I can't do it.

707
01:02:43,822 --> 01:02:48,892
About forgetting you.
I tried my best to do it.

708
01:02:51,912 --> 01:02:54,242
It's not something I can do.

709
01:02:54,752 --> 01:02:57,432
I can't. I won't.

710
01:03:00,682 --> 01:03:02,992
Let's just love each other.

711
01:03:13,432 --> 01:03:15,262
And if it's hard?

712
01:03:18,482 --> 01:03:20,641
Then it's hard.

713
01:03:20,642 --> 01:03:22,922
And if it hurts?

714
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:27,601
Let's hurt.

715
01:03:27,602 --> 01:03:29,932
If it's painful, it's painful.

716
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:34,712
If it's sad... it's sad.

717
01:03:35,432 --> 01:03:39,212
Just like that... just...

718
01:03:42,112 --> 01:03:44,252
Let's just love each other.

719
01:04:17,472 --> 01:04:25,472
