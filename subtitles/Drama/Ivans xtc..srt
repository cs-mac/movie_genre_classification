00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,312
Last night...

3
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,796
I had a terrible pain.

4
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,353
So hard pain I ate all the
pills I found in the house.

5
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,235
But the pills did not help.

6
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,954
The pain did not relax.

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,269
I tried to see some picture in front of me.

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,711
Who would have forgotten the pains.

9
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,878
But that's just the ignorance.

10
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,160
I did not come up with anything rational.

11
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,914
Emergency Phone.
- It's a matter of screaming at our doorstep...

12
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,877
Finnish: Arja Meski
www.undertext.se.

13
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,234
He was found in the morning from the floor.
He did the resistance. Overdose.

14
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,675
We found cocaine, alcohol,
all but syringes.

15
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
She does not breathe.

16
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,474
Quietly. What is your name?

17
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,158
Call the breathing apparatus.
Give 100 mg Celocurine.

18
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,229
Give tracheotomy equipment.

19
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,798
Has the ventilator become?

20
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,478
Oh God!

21
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,794
Media Talent Agency. Good morning.

22
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,072
Can I have Ivan Beckman's office?

23
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,989
Here's lvan Beckman's office.

24
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,355
Leave the message to Beckman or Lucy
Laurens after an acoustic signal.

25
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,951
This is Rosemary Kramer.
This is about lvan Beckman.

26
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,754
Here in Lloyd Hall.
I have played many times.

27
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,872
Please ask me to
call me right away.

28
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,117
What?

29
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,711
Ivan tirii perfectly.
Lloyd licked her up.

30
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,630
Has Lloyd called 8 times?
Yes, I can not contact you.

31
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,032
Wait.
Is that Lloyd again? What now?

32
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,149
Do you produce any message?
You would not go there.

33
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,239
This is an emergency.

34
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,078
What do you want?
We need to reach consensus.

35
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,274
That's what I try!
There is a faxed list...

36
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,235
Is it suitable for everyone?
Judy?

37
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,833
What now?

38
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,596
Here reads that leva died in the morning.
What?

39
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,396
I'll call and check.

40
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,989
What does that say?
He was in the hospital.

41
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,671
I saw him just recently and
he was not in hospital.

42
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,316
How did he die? With overdose?

43
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,789
He used hard drugs.
- Wait a minute. There is no need to speculate.

44
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,958
Last week he drove a bad crash.

45
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,792
Listen now. Has anyone
seen him lately?

46
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,710
He pulled drugs at the party.
- I do not want to hear any more about it, Joe.

47
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,708
Waiting Now. Barry?

48
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,710
I talked to Cedars.
The body is there.

49
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,198
Nobody knew anything.
Not parents or friends.

50
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,753
According to them he died of cancer.
But the reason could be whatever.

51
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,956
What do you mean by that?
We probably knew about the illness.

52
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,118
Take a moment's silence.

53
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,635
He has not answered the
phone calls for many days.

54
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,231
Many customers can become
embarrassed by Don West.

55
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,876
Then get ruined right away.

56
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,198
I saw Don West yesterday
with another agent.

57
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,190
I can talk to Don. I know him.

58
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,196
Hey, Brad. Hey. Nice to see you.

59
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,552
I'm sending Brutus to their trips.
I'm leaving for that.

60
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,917
How are you?
Good. That's the lvan's case.

61
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,753
Really bad. Spacious house.
Don has nice things to do.

62
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,830
I heard he died of drugs.
Not just lung cancer.

63
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,600
Don does not believe that.

64
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,874
It's cocaine use. I always
wondered where she got her energy.

65
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,198
Ivan was a good
friend of all of us.

66
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,029
He died tragically
and it is not funny.

67
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,312
Do you have something?
No thanks. I look forward to Donia.

68
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,478
She'll be back in five minutes.

69
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,358
Hands up or shoot!

70
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,592
Close the door. I left the keys in the car.

71
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,032
Yolanda! I thought there
were already banned ads.

72
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,915
Yolanda! But what about it?

73
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,110
Now I take the gun!

74
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,791
Hello, Don! How are you?
A few days have been seen.

75
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,039
- It's tragic.
- He is dead.

76
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,392
Yeah, a terrible case.
Was she crazy on her face?

77
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,956
Lava running the head on
fire manuscript waving...

78
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,280
"Help, help!" No one would have
helped the agent. Do not get mad.

79
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,679
Of course not. He died
long-suffering lung cancer.

80
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,634
It's a cover book.
She was cancerous.

81
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,599
Be known for a long time...

82
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,396
He was a drug and vulturist
and he died of cancer?

83
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,149
He was a good friend,
I do not know.

84
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,830
Who is there going down the stairs?

85
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,318
Johnny!
Brad, do something for these kids.

86
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,913
I do not want Danny McTeague
to direct the movie.

87
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,636
Danny's script is good.
Is required an impartial instructor.

88
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,152
I want to be Constanza Veron.

89
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,272
Constanza is good.
She knows the camera.

90
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,589
I can tell what
Danny irritates me.

91
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,873
I can not resist the teenagers
coming from young film schools.

92
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,757
I'm not going to make a status coma.
I want to make a scene at a time.

93
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,032
The instructor guides
and moves forward.

94
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,756
I understand well. Would you
like to believe in Constanta?

95
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,270
I'm sorry for the
national anthem, huh?

96
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,075
I said I want to film
with Constanza Vero.

97
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,354
He knows the camera, he's a lesbian,
and with them I'm gonna be kidding.

98
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,519
See all emails about
my family's writing.

99
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,350
And that's not all. Look at this.
I'll show you something.

100
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,190
Speak Sharon's fax to Fernando
for the terrible messages.

101
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,838
They've got them home too. If anyone
comes here... Look at her, Brad.

102
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,352
Yolanda!
Do not get kids in the bedroom.

103
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,074
Show him, Bradsky.

104
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,559
The thing for me is obvious,
the snout is for digging.

105
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,869
I agree.
If someone comes here to spit...

106
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,550
the reception is compliant.
Who would come here...

107
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,154
I'm not playing with me, Fernando.
I am Barry.

108
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,592
I want the film to be
controlled by Constanza Vero.

109
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,555
Great thanks for the help, Brad.
It was nice to meet you.

110
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,311
If you can speak for us, I
would be very grateful.

111
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,752
I'm on your side.
I appreciate your help.

112
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,239
You know movie stars.
The one does not handle it better.

113
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,398
Thank you. It was nice to see you.

114
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,431
Who is calling?
Danny. I've been calling all day.

115
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,393
You're on a cell phone, I know.

116
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,832
I've heard about lvan.
Awful business. Really bad.

117
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,797
Has Lloyd kicked me in the movie?
Is it true?

118
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,395
I have not been kicked before. Hand-
the script is mine. You are my agent!

119
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,755
Do you hear what I say? Hello?
Yeah, yeah, what do you say.

120
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,748
Barry? Barry? Deuce!

121
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,272
Call her again. Agent Barry.

122
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,190
Man is like a breath.
His life is like a shadow.

123
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,714
In the morning a man flourishes, in
the evening he is cut like a grass.

124
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,914
Teach us to use our day
properly and give us wisdom.

125
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,033
Look honest and be righteous.

126
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,916
For the future is for men of peace.

127
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,159
Who can better express
the farewell words?

128
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,909
Than the beloved sister of the deceased.

129
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,158
Marcia Beckman. Please, Marcia.

130
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,432
Thank you for being here.
It means a lot to our family.

131
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,839
And lvan would have been happy
to see how he was loved.

132
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,433
Don has not come yet.
He promised to come.

133
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,030
Do you see Charlotte?
Good looking to be sure.

134
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,676
- Good clumps.
- Olet vulgaari!

135
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,718
He was a good friend, a loving
family member and a great support.

136
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,115
I remember when I was small...

137
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,914
Deuce!
Danny does not look happy.

138
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,389
Danny is certainly not happy.
Do not look at her.

139
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,949
Hey! Are you having fun?
Be quiet!

140
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,312
It is not right now.
I know what you did. Sell me.

141
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,229
I cared your manuscript.
It was just fine.

142
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
Do not bury funerals!

143
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,398
Don was supposed to come.

144
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,152
I know it is always difficult
to lose a close one.

145
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,955
But I have to be
patient, and all of us.

146
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,039
We could not leave
goodbyes to Lance.

147
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,391
Thanks for coming.

148
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,194
- Don West...
- Oh God...

149
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,589
- Great actor...
- Come on, Danny!

150
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,875
Be silent, Barry. The dispute is
completely us! Hiber funeral!

151
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,878
- I swear I am...
- Get up.

152
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,313
Great actor!
Steal a Thief to play my movie!

153
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,196
Ivan Beckman's office. She just...

154
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,757
Wait a minute. I'm connecting.

155
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,590
Ivan. Here, Lucy.
Danny McTeague is calling.

156
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,271
How's it going, Danny? Great!

157
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,999
The studios are still fighting you.
I can see your name already in the letters!

158
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,637
"Weeds" is a great project!
I think so too. I wrote it.

159
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,990
Blood pressure is normal.

160
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,351
The script is really profound.

161
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,078
You should do it and not
do something terrible.

162
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,511
Wait a little.
Your weight has fallen.

163
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,589
I've been training. Do I look good?
I'm so thin to my taste.

164
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,717
Could not you talk about this?
I do not want Bonnie to know.

165
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:17,429
Forget Bonnie! I'm not talking about this.
I like it as a secret.

166
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,552
Stop it already.
Try to stop, Danny.

167
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,108
Iso moiskaus! It's a great job, Danny!
Come on!

168
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,836
Give it up here.
Do not make calls, Lucy.

169
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,433
Give me here. Give it here!
I mean, lvan.

170
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,875
Why are you so tight?
Three, three... I'll be up to you soon.

171
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,436
The temperature is normal.
Now the lung cancer is taken.

172
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,154
Why? Insurance.

173
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,912
I have to go.
The insurance company wants Xrays.

174
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,797
Have you ever burned?
X-rays must be taken. Come on.

175
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,596
All in the car.

176
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:30,359
Now get outta here. A timid pass.

177
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,474
Ladies, ladies.

178
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,838
It is terribly tense.

179
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,789
I do not understand L.A. I do not want
to be fucked and I do not lick my face.

180
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,393
My wife is a beautiful Italian lady. She has
a tussle and I want to dive in the throat.

181
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,149
You have a tropical flavor.
Where else is he?

182
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,148
Yolanda has not been in the
premiere of ten years.

183
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,831
As a wise woman she cares
for children at home.

184
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,429
And I can celebrate.

185
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,315
Does he trust you?
Let's go, Brady's company.

186
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,354
Have you ever been unfaithful
to your wife, Don?

187
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,599
Yolanda? Never.
I heard of little else.

188
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,555
You hold me perverted. Correct.

189
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,993
Is the pervert to smack in
two months from your punch?

190
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,839
Not for me.

191
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,397
Fantastic. Really heavenly.

192
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,831
I do not want to mess up your suit.
Do not mess.

193
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,317
It did good!

194
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,988
Naama's basic reading, Brad.

195
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,513
- Nice to see.
- Hey.

196
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,269
- Have you seen it?
- Real movie.

197
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,034
Ime him all the mokom but
what do you do in my limo?

198
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,711
I get the price from that replica.
Good evening!

199
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,389
So that's... Good creature. The man
is like he did not have a week.

200
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,672
Not in public.
Can you imagine them in bed?

201
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,398
Bring that fuck out there trying to
get my client out in the afternoon.

202
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,832
I'm being sawn in my persian all the time.
But you do not like it.

203
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,271
I would not be so sure... What?

204
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,400
I know how to starve
my neck and see me.

205
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,510
You're so silent.

206
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,551
What's wrong?
You're a murderer, Madeleine.

207
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,710
Sorry. Everything is my fault.

208
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,835
Your shows were amazing.
Is it true? Thank you.

209
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,077
Can you meet next week? I guess.

210
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,989
I'll call you.
Hey. Take care of yourself.

211
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,158
Goodbye.

212
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,353
Hello, lvan. What have you held up for?
I was in that satyr.

213
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:43,113
Margaret and lwan.
You have not met each other.

214
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,276
- Hey.
- Margaret and Joe.

215
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,597
- What's up, lvan?
- Not bad.

216
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,636
Do you make money for us, lvan?
I'll do my best. Good night.

217
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,830
Ivan. Did you avoid me?
Hey! Nice to see you.

218
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,077
What did you like about the movie?
I thought it was great.

219
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,068
Really? I thought it was disgusting.

220
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,909
You can be proud.
I can not. And I brought it.

221
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,874
There is one great
director, Danny McTeague.

222
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,755
Who is it? Angelic convulsions.

223
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,080
He was an Oscar nominee for
manuscript and guidance.

224
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,593
He has written a
manuscript called Weeds.

225
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,635
It's dark-colored, shimmery.
She could agree to Don.

226
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,871
Could not you show a manuscript?
I can not show it.

227
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,356
Bonnie is her agent.

228
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,439
I do not know.
Send a script to me.

229
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,953
Please send it to me.
Thank you. It was nice to see you.

230
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,956
Bonnie!

231
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,359
Do you want to thank me? Whence?

232
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,872
You might not want to make Weeds.
It's a pig.

233
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,949
Don is a full share...
Look for me in this matter.

234
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:24,508
What do you mean? Explain now.
I will be back soon.

235
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,999
I do not understand anything! I've
been together for a long time.

236
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,718
Do not care. The most important thing
is that Don wants to make Weeds.

237
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,469
Want to meet her?
Nytkö? And advertise?

238
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,596
I do not really control these patterns...
You're fine, Danny.

239
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,828
That's fine.
Are you ready? Let's go.

240
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,874
Did he lock it for sure?
Did he ask about it?

241
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,837
Let me introduce you: Danny McTeague.

242
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,350
Danny McTeague?
If Danny McTeague!

243
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,032
I'm a big fan.
No cards to the table.

244
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,597
What is the rule number one?

245
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,749
No gays!

246
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,397
What about rule number two?
You are gays.

247
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,875
What about the third?
That is not.

248
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,710
Come down.
That's great! Sit down.

249
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,436
He has written the script for Weeds.
Take it.

250
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,792
Tsau, lvan. Do not get tired of anything!
Ivan!

251
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,555
Charlotte? Are there any problems?
Is not.

252
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,117
The script is creepy.
Listen now.

253
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,438
I'd better write
ten times better.

254
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,158
"He is not afraid of ignorance.
He just bends and raises the ball."

255
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,673
"The man yells, 'Get out of here!'
The woman does not grow old."

256
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,395
"She looks at the
muscular shape of a man"

257
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,991
"and his gaze stops
in the swollen eye."

258
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:29,435
"Frightened, angry, in tears .."
Time is wrong.

259
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:38,071
Really horrible.
What is this soo?

260
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,229
Why are you trying to sell it?
What do you do not like?

261
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,591
Have you read it? You go first.

262
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,828
You have not read it.
You do not know what it says.

263
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,476
Say what does it say?
Rikkaruohosta.

264
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,639
It winds along the slope.
Deadly weed.

265
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,632
Just like Jaakko and the bean wand.
I would write much better.

266
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,798
A fussy thing.

267
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,518
I'm serious.

268
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,278
Do not think about it, honey.

269
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,518
I can not stand that you sell one.

270
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,837
What is missing from the
script is seen on the canvas.

271
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,750
Danny McTeague knows
how to make big money.

272
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,350
Believe me.

273
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,269
Even though I am young and
beautiful, I'm not stupid.

274
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,199
Who said so?

275
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,793
I print my own script to Don.
It was already spoken of.

276
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,951
He was all interested in it.
It should be.

277
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,709
Please be here and stay here.
- I do not have time to. There are many things to do.

278
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,953
Gold. Do not blow it down now.

279
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,392
Stay here.
Seksi does not like to amuse now.

280
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,153
Do you think Donia?
You're so paranoid, lvan!

281
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,273
If that were the case, I would
love you and think of him.

282
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,838
I'm not sour. There is so much to do.
I'm terribly busy.

283
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,793
I'm sure you understand.

284
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,789
You do not believe me.

285
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,240
Hello, hi, darling.

286
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,991
Hey, dog. How are you?

287
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,353
Good morning!

288
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,395
Hey, Lucy. Take the papers.

289
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,309
The phone is hot. Who has fired?

290
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,478
Everyone is furious.

291
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,832
Has Verite been called?

292
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,110
Lloyd Hall on the twin lane.

293
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,757
I'm playing the manuscript you sent.
It got bad reviews.

294
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,318
I have good reviews about it.
Send them to me.

295
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,239
Danny McTeague on the second line.

296
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,830
Ivan. I want to explain something.

297
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,990
Did you hear? That's my opinion
about Don West. I do not want her.

298
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,718
Don West finances your movie!
Larry Barton does it for free.

299
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,117
And he is not worth it anymore!

300
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,110
Peru's Don West Agreement.
And he probably would not agree.

301
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,111
Say it's a lesbian... I do not remember
the name... Constanza, it's Italian.

302
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,392
Don can not stand gay and
get away right away.

303
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,515
- Constanza True?
- Any True.

304
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,518
Guess what? You Are amazing.
Thank you.

305
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,349
Nobody likes it, lvan.

306
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,997
Have you posted reviews?
I am, but I have not read Weed.

307
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:27,072
Say it's good that McTeague
guides it and recommends it.

308
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,229
As you like.
I'm talking to Barry.

309
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,109
Hey, Phil. What does Barry do?
Is on the phone.

310
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,675
I go there.

311
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,998
I talked to the studio in the afternoon.

312
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,753
I agree. It should be an interest
rate on what they pay for.

313
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,190
- Hey.
- How's it going?

314
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,154
Rough day...
You have good customers.

315
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,989
The biggest is Constanza.
He has Oscar access but...

316
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,510
He is too old or lesbian,
and now he wants to guide.

317
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,269
Is he free?
Something is planned.

318
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,675
Danny McTeague
wants him to Weed.

319
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,476
- What part?
- Bethin. Don West.

320
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,435
Is it true? Have you heard of them?
Love is remarkable.

321
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,869
- Hello?
- Constanza. How are you?

322
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,791
Could you read the Weeds and
certainly the right version?

323
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,836
Do you want Weeds, Amanda?
It's on the desk.

324
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,355
Is it located in Alabama?

325
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,998
My version of my version
happened to be in L.A.

326
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,351
Then you have the wrong version.

327
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,795
You're Don West's counter-actress.
You will love the good...

328
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,152
with Don West in Alabama.

329
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,875
Listen. I'll read it again.

330
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:16,474
I keep in mind what you
said and call you soon.

331
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,032
Mission accomplished.
Do you think he plays?

332
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,629
Lucy. Connect to Tarzan's office.

333
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:30,278
I would have been on my knees...
Because we're bothering you.

334
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,836
Hello?

335
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,873
- You.
- Take the speaker.

336
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,551
What's up, lvan?
Good, Don. And for you?

337
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,309
Congratulations, you've
got a full moon.

338
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,750
Want to do Weeds?

339
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,988
I want to weed the weeds with
Constanza Vero for four months.

340
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,510
What about Ted?

341
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,669
What do I care about Ted?
Ted is out, you're in.

342
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,872
Ladies and gentlemen, Don
West belongs to ours!

343
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,038
Congratulations!

344
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,874
- What did Don say?
- She agrees.

345
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,837
Awesome, nicely trained!
Here are the calls. Beyond belief!

346
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,309
Who is Jackie?
The most immediate thing about insurance.

347
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,479
Alright. Thank you.
Congratulations!

348
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:49,990
Jackie? Hey, here's Lenny Beckman.
The doctor wants to meet you.

349
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,194
What is it about?
She wants you to come here.

350
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,030
Is that something special?
She just wants you to come.

351
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,915
It's a bit busy, I do not
know when I'll get it.

352
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,078
You have to come today.

353
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,268
Can not you say anything?

354
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,952
He asked me to call.
She is late at the reception.

355
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,359
At your convenience?
I do not really know.

356
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,634
Could you come with someone?
Any friend though?

357
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,517
Let's see, Jackie.
Take someone with you if you can.

358
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,599
It's a deal. Thank you.
See you later.

359
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,590
- Hey!
- Beckman!

360
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,554
- You Are amazing!
- Thank you.

361
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,911
Everyone loves you.
With this day.

362
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:01,116
Are you going to celebrate? Have fun.
Great job!

363
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,629
What are you doing?

364
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,595
I can not leave all these jobs.

365
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,236
Go have fun.
You're so kind, Lucy.

366
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,352
Go already!
Has Charlotte called?

367
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,918
Oh yeah. He regretted yesterday's
premenstrual irritation.

368
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,513
Why did not you tell it?
I forgot it. Sorry.

369
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,473
Thank you.
Have fun. You can play.

370
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,276
Oh God!

371
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,712
Hey, here's Charlotte.
Leave the message so I call.

372
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,916
Hey, here's lvan. Can you call?
This is important. I'm in the car.

373
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,388
Ivan? Come on in.

374
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,717
Well...

375
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,556
This is not worrying.

376
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,517
Here in the left lung...
This area seems suspicious.

377
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,036
Is it cancerous?

378
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,712
I would like to ask you:
Do you have dyspnoea?

379
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,399
Sometimes it happens, sometimes...

380
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,276
Do you feel uncomfortable
pain in your chest or back?

381
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,837
If I'm in a bad position,
I can get chest pain.

382
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,828
Did you cough a lot?
Mornings. Who does not cough you?

383
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,830
It is true.
Does the blood sometimes spit?

384
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,197
Ivan! How's it going?
Very. What about you?

385
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,994
Finely. Watch the beautiful.
There's Bobby.

386
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,478
Melanie.
Jessie. Nice to meet you.

387
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,274
Francesca. Being met.

388
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,517
Little...? You know the place.

389
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,236
Enthusiastic feeling.
Could you wait for a minute?

390
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,070
Well small. You know how much
fun there are for three girls.

391
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,397
You're a good man, Bobby.

392
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,513
Always nice to see you, lvan.
You're a knight.

393
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,714
I'll make sure that I love them.
Thank you, Bobby.

394
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,829
I guess that's enough. Take it yourself too.
- Thank you.

395
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,798
- Which girls lost?
- Tylsää.

396
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,958
Did you find your phone?

397
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,628
Hemmetin tiput!

398
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,276
- Hello?
- Hey, Francesca.

399
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,951
Hey, where are you?
In an upstairs penthouse.

400
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,073
Penthouse...
Go ahead and find out.

401
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,755
- Now, let's have fun.
- Ivan!

402
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,080
Danny-boy! How did you find me?

403
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,434
How's it going?
Who dared to act as an actress?

404
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,872
How are you doing?
A little man does not pull you.

405
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:53,394
I want you to represent me!
Weeds become a movie!

406
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,754
- Bobby!
- Koko urani...

407
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,909
Do you want to be an actress?
I'm a teen actor but!

408
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:10,992
Do you get a taxi?
We have the money and Don West!

409
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:17,116
Please son!
This man will take you home.

410
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,951
Do not just get in the door.
It would be my love.

411
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,639
Do not be shy.

412
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,837
- Who is it?
- Beckman.

413
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,953
Ivan Beckman?
That mischievous cheerleader?

414
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,235
It's a pricey, bald
head, a sucker...

415
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,195
It is my understanding of you.
Love a show!

416
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,315
My mother is Irish.
Maybe I could use accents.

417
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,229
Maybe in this movie.
My friend Bobby.

418
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,989
Hey, Bobby.
She's got to arrange what.

419
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,159
I do not need anything.
Definitely nothing.

420
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,955
Danny McTeague just left.
I picked him up in the elevator.

421
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:24,633
Was he in good shape?
In a slightly moved state of mind.

422
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,479
You should close the door, Bobby.

423
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,550
I would nipple her cheeks.
Do you want to pinch his nipples?

424
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,232
- Look now. Pinch.
- But a little.

425
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,553
I get heart ache soon.
Now I can not go home.

426
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,150
You're so tanned.
Where did you get the color?

427
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,194
Now continue.
It's just getting bored.

428
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,472
We were already naked and put on again.

429
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,755
Speak for your own, Don.
The secrets have already been told.

430
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,634
I'm saying, Don.

431
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:18,030
Have you slept or do you want to
have my girlfriend Charlotte?

432
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,509
I can not take this...

433
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,678
You are horrible.

434
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,078
Answer the question, Don.
What am I against?

435
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,991
You tugged his throat in front of my nose.
Would I like to fuck her...?

436
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,389
She... Guess what? Charlotte
has a bad duckweed syndrome.

437
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,990
He has ambition. Unlike you.

438
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,478
He's a traitor.
I want to fuck her: I want to.

439
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,116
- Did I fuck her?
- Are you?

440
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,233
Have I bitten?
What do you care about it?

441
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,069
Why not care?
She does not even wear panties.

442
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,512
He gave my sniff to his head.
Forget it.

443
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,679
You're a kitty, lwan.
He only thinks of himself.

444
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,431
Like all. If I had a
chance to fuck him,

445
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,599
I would have snatched him in every
hole and hung him on the flagpole.

446
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,478
I could fuck all these women.
Bobby made me a little worried.

447
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:35,471
Bobby talked about his own
girlfriend and was worried...

448
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,992
- lme him.
- What?

449
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,475
Ime him. And no name!

450
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,150
Otherwise, you'll get off.
There are rules.

451
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,830
Ime now, my name.

452
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,079
Do not be a cheerleader.
Do it or go out.

453
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,716
Do you want to leave or leave?
I will not leave.

454
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,277
You will not leave. Do not spill
the vodka on my shoulder.

455
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,316
Can I have a silence for a moment?
I'll pay for these Kettles.

456
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,795
Allright then.

457
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,436
Are you going to do it? Good.
Good girl.

458
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,598
I'm a big girl, and parts.

459
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:23,511
- Well...
- You guys...

460
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,077
But not to play...

461
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,831
Speaking of lmemes...

462
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,477
You will not be allowed to watch! It
does not matter. Listen to lurps.

463
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,116
You do not have to.

464
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,231
Healthy, doggy. Bye.

465
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:51,353
Hello?
This is Lucy. The meeting has begun.

466
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:55,678
All right, I will come soon. Lucy?

467
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:01,796
Won you to call the repair service?
Did you run the crash?

468
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,198
I'm not. The ring broke out.
Alright. I will call.

469
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,358
Thank you. Hey.

470
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,513
Oh God.

471
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,955
Hey. Are you lvan Beckman?
I see that the ring is empty.

472
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,870
I'll handle it in ten minutes, but
I'll look at your membership card.

473
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,959
Hey! What are you doing here?
Come on.

474
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:08,109
You have the chance to have a party.
Have you seen the leaves?

475
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,915
"Western Tail East.
From Symbolist to Beckman."

476
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,078
And so write Verite!

477
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,751
Hello, I'm Ira Reuter. But rather.
Can I tell you a lover?

478
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,836
Could you sit there?

479
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,837
I'm sitting at the desk.
I would like to ask a few questions.

480
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,634
How have you been sleeping lately?

481
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,308
I'm fine. Usually.

482
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,479
What about having sex
or masturbating...

483
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,595
Does everything work like it should?
Yes, yes.

484
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,476
I'm not writing anything here.
May I smoke? I nikotinisti.

485
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,150
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

486
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,639
Dependence... Do you use
drugs and in what case?

487
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,834
I do not use more than anyone else.

488
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,510
What does it mean in your circles?

489
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,872
It is said that we sometimes
get a little strong.

490
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:44,950
What substances do you use?
A little one and repeat...

491
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,073
cocaine and little pills.

492
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,795
Do you use cocaine once
a week or once a year?

493
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,709
Depends on the little life situation.

494
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:03,234
If there is a lot going on and the
customers are in the party, I'll go.

495
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,195
What about alcohol?
Ryyppy periods sometimes.

496
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,951
Seasonal drinking... Once
a week or once a month?

497
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:18,234
Once a week.
I might be an alcoholic weekend.

498
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,237
Thank you. Why did you come here?

499
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:29,790
As I said, my doctor urged
me to talk to someone.

500
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,958
Whence?

501
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,157
Recently...

502
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,990
I got a diagnosis of " cancer ".
I do not know what that means.

503
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:53,149
I found a shadow in my lungs.
I had to call an oncologist.

504
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,279
I'm going to poke a cigar.

505
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,593
Have you called oncologist?
I do not.

506
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,918
- It may seem frightening.
- So.

507
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,477
- Are you worried?
- I am.

508
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:22,199
I notice your mother is dead.
Where did he die?

509
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,915
He died of cancer.

510
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,230
Do you have the number of
theologian with you, lvan?

511
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,353
I suppose so. Should we call?

512
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,791
Do you want me to play for you?

513
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,070
That would be good.

514
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,593
Sorry.

515
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,389
HOMEOPATIA

516
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,679
Well, but hey! Days.

517
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,513
What is the feeling today?
Good. What about you?

518
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,517
Better than ever.

519
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,549
Hello?
Did you read my manuscript?

520
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,834
What? Sorry, sweetheart.
Are you still angry?

521
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,953
I do not, of course.
Is not that why?

522
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,950
No no. It was just
such a busy week.

523
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:16,872
What are you doing tonight?
I'm having dinner with my dad.

524
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,998
Hey, all right. You will come soon.

525
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,080
Why did not you party?
It was such a tough week.

526
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,909
- Is it?
- Is.

527
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,954
That's where I have a scapegoat.
Martin was there.

528
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:01,598
Or was Martin there?
Our dear friend Martin.

529
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,509
This will spice up. No more than you take.

530
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:11,670
What did you have?
The wound has been tough.

531
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,557
To sleep with. Don Westin agent.
It's really great!

532
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,797
Everyone is talking about it.

533
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,717
Maybe we should not
take more but...

534
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:35,519
This helps to withstand
the diner at dinner.

535
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,917
Thanks for coming.

536
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,478
You look gorgeous.
I am a little lost.

537
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,478
You do not have to lose weight.

538
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,195
Do not try to fatten me.

539
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,716
How have you been?
I've missed you.

540
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,912
So do you too.

541
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:10,354
Maybe I should have
gone home after all.

542
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,916
I got that in it.

543
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,078
Hi dad.

544
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:24,394
Is this yours? Would not it?
It's nice. Lots of color.

545
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,274
This is great.
Is not this your job here?

546
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,112
Well, but... sister.
Hey, lvan. How are you?

547
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,357
- How are you?
- Good.

548
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,475
Here is my girlfriend Charlotte.
Do not I live in New York?

549
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:50,232
Nice to meet you.
What are you doing?

550
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,557
She is an artist.
What kind of artist?

551
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,392
I'm currently studying the human body.
Nude models.

552
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:05,436
Marcia was just about to show her drawings.
Do you want to see?

553
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:13,629
Here's my job. What do you like, dad?
Samant like before.

554
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,753
This is something new.

555
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,795
Show it first.
It starts to be the right one.

556
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,118
Is that true?
I'll show you something, lvan.

557
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,632
Is not he beautiful?
There was something in it.

558
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:38,035
Thank you for showing them.

559
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:44,236
Manny said you've succeeded.
So. I am happy about it.

560
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,831
Tarzana was very pleased.
He's been kind of friendly.

561
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:54,398
She's only interested in money.
She's an agent.

562
01:04:54,600 --> 01:05:00,675
It is difficult to maintain some
kind of regulation in this work.

563
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:07,672
It's my life, dad. It's my
milieu, I get my bread.

564
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,908
Talent Seeker-son.

565
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,234
I do not know where your girlfriend is.
Charlotte? Charlotte!

566
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:33,070
I went a little bit embarrassing.

567
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,159
What did you talk about?

568
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:44,993
- Of course.
- Kind of.

569
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:51,878
Quiet how seriously you take it.

570
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:05,753
You have not got almost anything.
I gave you a solid lunch.

571
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,748
Strong lunch?
The clock is half past ten.

572
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:16,354
I was out in the happy
hour and ate little heat.

573
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:21,953
I did not want to eat,
I just came along.

574
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,593
I know what the question is. Ivan is
again tangled with the cocaine launcher.

575
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,872
- Could you be silent!
- I do not!

576
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:36,471
He has been kidding all the time
since he came from the bathroom bar!

577
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,475
I can tell you I'm eating
antidepressant medicines.

578
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:47,277
It makes me influence a little...
What?

579
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:53,555
Nothing. It was just fun.
It was hysterical fun.

580
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:00,233
I eat antidepressant drugs, and
that's why I'm a little nervous.

581
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,318
You do not have to explain.

582
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,798
He accused me of using cocaine.

583
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,515
- It certainly is not.
- What?

584
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:18,273
That's enough.
You always have a small reel.

585
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:25,909
Can not we just enjoy it together?
This is a nice family dinner.

586
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,351
So you think.

587
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:34,475
If I'm not honest for
you, who would be?

588
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,593
Regarding what?
Is Charlotte honest?

589
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,837
- Then be honest.
- Yes I am.

590
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:46,352
What kind of perversion
do you want me to mess?

591
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,712
I'm not messing you with anything.
I know you already enough.

592
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,074
That's enough. You are
very dear to us, lvan.

593
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:03,072
Now at least went to appetite.
But you do not like what I do.

594
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,478
Yes, that's true.

595
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:13,835
You're still drowning, lwan!
That's enough!

596
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,076
If your mom was here.

597
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,796
Mom is not here. Mother is dead!

598
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,918
Charlotte? What? Tell me, lvan?

599
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:42,559
Do not you see how embarrassing it was?
Should I just leave?

600
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:17,915
Hey, here's Charlotte.
Leave the message so I call.

601
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,509
Hey, lvan here.

602
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:26,397
Could you call? This is important.
I want to tell you something.

603
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,913
I'm sorry, koiruus.

604
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:43,433
Have I missed you? Am I?

605
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,598
Sorry, my dog.

606
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,996
Hey, here's Charlotte.
Leave a message...

607
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:14,559
- Hello?
- Hey. Someone needs you.

608
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,196
Francesca. Hey! Hi, how are you?

609
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:25,317
Good. How about you? Come here.
The same thing as the last one?

610
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,389
It sounds good.
Does Jessie come in?

611
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:02,552
Hello? Hey, Charlotte.
What are you doing? You're breathless.

612
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,709
I listened to music.
Nice to call.

613
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,153
- You do not mind?
- I do not.

614
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,639
What did you have to tell?
The car was terrible.

615
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,311
- I am so sorry.
- I too am.

616
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:29,356
I was a bit wretched too.
The wind is too crowded.

617
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,155
What was the matter with you?

618
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:38,115
Can you chat in the morning?
Does your doorstep?

619
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,632
It can not be me.
It's yours. Who is there?

620
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:48,119
I do not expect anyone.
See who it is and come back.

621
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,518
I'd rather talk in the morning.
I'm so tired.

622
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:58,590
Will I come there?
No, no, no. Eat breakfast.

623
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,509
Do you agree? Charlotte?

624
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,678
Go to the door to open it!

625
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,958
Hey!

626
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:22,071
Whose turn? Truth or Dare.

627
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,036
Good!

628
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,030
Well, lvan. Truth or Dare?

629
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,231
Truth. I'm boring.

630
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,672
How many different drugs did you take?

631
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,670
How many? Please list.

632
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:17,955
- 200 grams of cocoa.
- At least.

633
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,234
- EXtaCY.
- It's already seen.

634
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:29,879
There was more. Hepoa? Heroin?

635
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,709
No. That's the limit.

636
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,118
Is it true?
I do not like heroin.

637
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,880
Maybe I could try it out?
You could.

638
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,992
- Maybe I'll try.
- Next time.

639
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:50,435
What do people have against heroin?
Now I have decided.

640
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,078
There was something else, too.
You're not as cloudy as me.

641
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:01,149
You did not say you love me.
Yeah, there is more.

642
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,989
What do you know about us?
Tell the truth.

643
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:14,157
- Recipe Taboos?
- Good stuff.

644
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,318
This is my dog's medicine.

645
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,519
- My mom ate these.
- Söikö?

646
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:30,556
- Is it true?
- He died of cancer.

647
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,668
Cancer drugs.

648
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,278
I have cancer.

649
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,070
Tummy lungs.

650
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,352
It takes my breath.

651
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,197
Do you know what? Last night...

652
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,916
I had a terrible pain.

653
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:09,434
So hard pains that I took all the
pills I found out of the house.

654
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,270
But the pills did not help.

655
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,914
The pain did not relax.

656
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:23,468
I tried to see some picture in front of me.

657
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,638
Who would have forgotten the pains.

658
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,754
But that's just the ignorance.

659
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:38,870
I did not come up with anything rational.

660
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:46,319
I just remember...

661
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,717
when I was three or four years old.

662
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,835
I remember when my mom liked me.

663
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,795
He had a knit shirt on top.
I sat down on her chest.

664
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,039
She smelled so sweet.

665
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,276
And what about it...

666
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,799
What's going on with my dog?

667
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:36,629
Do you think the Animal Protection
Association will take it?

668
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,798
Is it given somewhere?

669
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,078
Do not pity me.

670
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,909
Why hurt?

671
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,196
Once...

672
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:01,469
Once again you too.

673
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,638
Your time will come.

674
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:02,113
This is a concern for us.
We hear the screams.

675
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:19,117
Quietly. Do not be afraid.

676
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:28,400
Everything will be allright. Be calm.

677
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,878
Turn you over. Just calm down.

678
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,228
How much cocaine did you take?
Talk to me.

679
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,351
Send the ambulance.

680
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,396
Good morning.

681
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,038
He was found on the floor.

682
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,391
He did the resistance.
Probably an overdose.

683
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,479
Cocaine, alcohol,
everything except syringes.

684
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,956
Do you know him?
She does not breathe.

685
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,469
What is your name?

686
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,676
LMU!

687
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:45,952
Call the breathing apparatus.
Give 100 mg Celocurine.

688
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,478
Give tracheotomy equipment.

689
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,516
Did the breathing apparatus come in?

690
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,998
Where does all the blood come from? LMU.
Do you have a hose?

691
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,156
Knife.

692
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,557
Oh God!

693
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,036
Hey.

694
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,075
She hears. He can not just talk.

695
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:53,195
To whom would we call?
Could you type a number?

696
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,551
I do not think he wants
to contact anybody.

697
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,595
Do you want to say something?

698
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,839
Hi God God.

699
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,106
