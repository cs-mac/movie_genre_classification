1
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,799
THREE COLORS
RED

2
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,782
Come here.

3
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,492
<i>This is 320 04 86.</i>

4
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:43,329
<i>Leave your name and number</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

5
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,958
<i>Valentine?</i>

6
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,793
<i>Valentine?</i>

7
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,004
<i>Are you home?</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

8
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,423
<i>I'll call back later.</i>

9
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,050
Michel...

10
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,511
I was having breakfast.

11
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,223
<i>First it was busy, and now</i>
<i>the machine. Are you alone?</i>

12
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,224
Yes.

13
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,893
<i>- All alone?</i>
- All alone.

14
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,063
The agency was on the line
about a photo shoot,

15
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,065
setting up a time.

16
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,276
When did you get back?

17
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,737
<i>Yesterday.</i>
<i>I called, but you weren't home.</i>

18
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,740
<i>Our car was stolen in Poland.</i>
<i>They got everything:</i>

19
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,493
<i>passports, money, clothes.</i>

20
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,829
So what happened?

21
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,039
<i>A nice guy put us up.</i>

22
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,084
<i>The embassy gave us money</i>
<i>and passports, and we got home.</i>

23
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,794
Michel?

24
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,923
I felt lonely last night.

25
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,260
<i>What did you do?</i>

26
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,432
I slept with your jacket
the whole night.

27
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,729
I wanted to be with you.

28
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,064
<i>I can't right now, Valentine.</i>

29
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,610
I know.
What's the weather like there?

30
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,778
<i>Typical English weather:</i>
<i>It's pouring.</i>

31
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,323
It rained here yesterday too.

32
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,076
The sun's out now.
It's spring.

33
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,203
<i>Where were you</i>
<i>when I called last night?</i>

34
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,999
I took your advice and saw
<i>Dead Poets Society.</i>

35
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,418
<i>- Great movie.</i>
- I liked it a lot.

36
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,128
<i>I'll call you tonight.</i>

37
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,797
I'll be back at 7:00,
and I'll stay in.

38
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,382
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

39
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,596
- I miss you.
<i>- Me too.</i>

40
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,640
A big hug.

41
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,194
<i>Personalized weather reports.</i>

42
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,819
Hello.

43
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,202
Lose?

44
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,628
<i>Take that out.</i>

45
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,841
Take your sweater.

46
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,262
Put it around your neck.

47
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,182
Sleeves too.
- Like this?

48
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,601
Give me a profile.

49
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,147
No, don't smile.

50
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,232
Look sad.

51
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,694
Sadder.
Think of something awful.

52
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,404
That's it.

53
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,739
Sad.

54
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,825
Now it's coming! That's it!

55
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,786
Turn and six
and seven on the barre.

56
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,914
And one and two
and three and four.

57
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,001
Stretch and six
and seven and eight.

58
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,212
And one, plié,
and three and four.

59
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,133
Back and six
and seven and stretch.

60
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,093
Keep stretching.

61
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,056
Stretch your chin, your arm,
out to your fingertips.

62
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,434
Stretch your hand, your neck.

63
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,272
Relax through your toes.
Stretch.

64
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,656
I almost fell.

65
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,328
Excuse me. The door was open.

66
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,124
I'm sorry.
I think I ran over your dog.

67
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,879
Rita. A German shepherd.

68
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,340
That's possible.

69
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,884
She disappeared yesterday.

70
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,261
She's in my car. Alive.

71
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,597
I don't know what to do.

72
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:17,105
Would you like me
to take her to a vet?

73
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,067
As you wish.

74
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,238
If I ran over your daughter,

75
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,574
would you react the same way?

76
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,994
I don't have a daughter, miss.

77
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,750
Go away.

78
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,966
Don't close the door!

79
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,981
Everything's fine.
We stitched her up.

80
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,983
Otherwise just a few bruises.

81
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,029
She'll need some rest.

82
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,156
She's pregnant.

83
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,659
Will you take her or leave her here?

84
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,828
I'll take her.

85
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,872
We'll help you carry her.

86
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,166
Marc.

87
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,013
<i>Are you alone?</i>

88
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,851
Say something.

89
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,400
You hear that? I have a dog.

90
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,487
A dog.
I ran over her yesterday.

91
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,991
Michel, I'm sorry.

92
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,701
<i>That wasn't funny.</i>

93
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,078
No, it wasn't.

94
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,581
<i>I knew it was a joke.</i>
<i>I could see you laughing.</i>

95
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,917
You remember how we met?

96
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,627
<i>I remember.</i>

97
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,924
If I hadn't stepped out during
the break, we'd never have met.

98
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,634
<i>That's true.</i>

99
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,220
<i>Valentine, return the dog.</i>

100
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,805
I tried.

101
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,224
The owner doesn't want it.

102
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,725
<i>Who is it?</i>

103
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,021
I hear an alarm.
It might be my car.

104
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,733
It's my car.

105
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,612
Wait while I turn it off.

106
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,115
<i>- I'm in a hurry.</i>
- I understand.

107
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,851
Move.

108
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,436
Move!

109
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,494
They prefer these.

110
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,417
They'll be using the slogan
"A breath of life."

111
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,587
Which do you prefer?

112
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,471
I like this one.

113
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,014
Me too.

114
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,063
It'll be 65 by 25 feet.

115
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,609
Will people recognize you?

116
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,030
Like who?

117
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,333
Who are you thinking of?

118
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,472
Not you.

119
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,734
Bad sign, eh?

120
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,405
I think I know why I won.
Good-bye.

121
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,948
So long.

122
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,364
Back already?

123
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,451
The mailman delivered
some money for you.

124
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,456
- Who could have sent it?
- No idea.

125
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,209
Isn't that your brother?

126
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,964
Or someone who looks like him.

127
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,635
What a shame.
Does your family read this paper?

128
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,305
I don't know. Thank you.

129
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,973
Good-bye.

130
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,006
May I speak to Marie, please?

131
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,846
It's Valentine.
Will you see Marc soon?

132
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,848
<i>Tonight, probably.</i>

133
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,394
Tell him to call me.
As late as he wants.

134
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,697
I'll let you run around.

135
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,950
But don't run away, okay?

136
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,244
Promise?

137
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,872
There.

138
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,159
Excuse me. My dog ran away.

139
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,593
Call her. She's yours.

140
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,167
- Did you send this?
- For the vet.

141
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,295
- How'd you get my address?
- It wasn't hard.

142
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,466
You don't know what it cost.

143
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,678
It was 130 francs.

144
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,098
You sent 600.

145
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,484
Wait here. I'll get the rest.

146
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,198
What about Rita?

147
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,118
She's a very intelligent dog.

148
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,245
Take her.

149
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,998
- You don't want her?
- I want nothing.

150
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,044
Then just stop breathing.

151
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,005
Good idea.

152
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,106
Did you stop breathing?

153
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,459
<i>If you don't come over,</i>
<i>you'll never see me again.</i>

154
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,712
<i>But today is Sunday.</i>

155
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,966
<i>Yesterday was Saturday</i>
<i>and we were together.</i>

156
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,970
<i>I can't talk right now, my friend.</i>
<i>We're about to have lunch.</i>

157
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,015
<i>I just ask one thing:</i>
<i>Don't call me "my friend."</i>

158
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,435
<i>Talk to me like yesterday.</i>
<i>Call me Pierre... or Pierrot...</i>

159
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,562
<i>or "my love."</i>

160
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,314
<i>Say "my love."</i>

161
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,984
<i>Let me go to another room.</i>

162
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,125
<i>- Pierre, I'm alone now.</i>
<i>- So am I.</i>

163
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,335
<i>Far from you.</i>

164
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,213
<i>I want you to come over.</i>
<i>I can't be alone!</i>

165
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:16,843
<i>Pierre, we agreed to meet tomorrow.</i>
<i>I miss you too.</i>

166
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,637
<i>You have to understand —</i>
<i>- I don't want to!</i>

167
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,431
<i>I'm thinking of you.</i>

168
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:26,227
<i>You're naked in front of the mirror.</i>
<i>But for someone else, not for me.</i>

169
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,564
<i>I want to kiss you.</i>
<i>I lean forward...</i>

170
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,275
<i>and with my lips I touch...</i>

171
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,235
What are you doing?

172
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,744
- I'm eavesdropping.
- What?

173
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,753
Listening in
on my neighbors' phone calls.

174
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,715
You shouldn't have turned it off.
It was getting interesting.

175
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,721
You don't seem amused.

176
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,182
- That's disgusting.
- Yes...

177
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,893
and illegal too.

178
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,564
Your 30 francs.

179
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,863
One minute, miss.

180
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,163
You feel certain you're right,
don't you?

181
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,915
Yes.

182
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,126
Then why don't you do
something about it?

183
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,128
Like what?

184
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,882
<i>Can't I touch your scar</i>

185
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,634
<i>like I did —</i>

186
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,516
Go see that man.

187
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,436
Tell him someone's listening
to his conversations.

188
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,481
While you're at it,

189
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,441
tell him it's me.

190
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,110
I will.

191
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,281
It's that house there.

192
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,829
Hello.

193
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,250
- I'd like to see Mr. —
- My husband?

194
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,795
He's upstairs on the phone.
Let me turn off the stove.

195
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,801
Go on in, please.

196
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,580
Have a seat.

197
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,290
He'll be right down.

198
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:56,210
Caroline, don't play around.
Daddy's talking.

199
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,089
I'm sorry.
I have the wrong address.

200
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,924
This is number 22.

201
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,843
Yes. I'm very sorry.

202
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,386
Don't mention it.

203
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,555
Have a nice day.

204
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,138
- Good-bye.
- I'll call you later.

205
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,111
You dropped this.

206
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,627
Well?

207
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,837
Did you tell him?

208
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,429
Would you like something to drink?

209
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,348
No, I wouldn't.

210
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,562
I only came back —

211
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,731
I came back to ask something of you.

212
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:43,693
Stop doing this.

213
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,155
I've done it all my life.

214
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,341
What were you?

215
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,093
A cop?

216
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,971
Worse. A judge.

217
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,646
A judge?

218
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,857
Never seen a judge in person?

219
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,201
Would you like to try?

220
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,662
It makes a very nice sound.

221
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,339
I don't know if I was
on the side of right or wrong.

222
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,634
Here at least...

223
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,511
I know more or less
where the truth lies.

224
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,015
You have a much better
vantage point than in a courtroom.

225
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,604
People have a right
to their secrets.

226
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,189
Of course.

227
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,695
You didn't tell him.
What stopped you?

228
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,534
The fact that he has a nice wife

229
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,745
who's devoted to him,

230
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,831
and a sweet little daughter
who loves him?

231
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,709
Is that why you couldn't do it?

232
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,712
Were you seized by remorse

233
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,382
or just afraid to cause harm?

234
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,842
Maybe both.

235
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,472
Let me tell you.

236
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:41,018
I can eavesdrop on them or not.
You can tell him or not.

237
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,063
But sooner or later,

238
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,732
he'll jump out the window,

239
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,528
or she'll find out everything.

240
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:56,742
Someone will tell their daughter,
and their lives will be a living hell.

241
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,414
And what can we do about it?

242
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,461
You have nothing to say?

243
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,340
Does this remind you of something?

244
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,175
- Yes.
- What?

245
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,885
Say it.

246
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,306
A boy I know.

247
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,101
A boy you know who...

248
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:23,936
what?

249
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,605
Found out his mother was a whore?

250
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,402
Who found out...

251
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,114
he wasn't his father's son.

252
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,700
He was 15.

253
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,372
That man's daughter...

254
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,294
she knows too.

255
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,880
Stay a minute.

256
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,303
Why?

257
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,474
The light is beautiful.

258
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,484
<i>Personalized weather reports.</i>

259
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,153
<i>I'm the one driving</i>
<i>to Turin tomorrow.</i>

260
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,364
<i>Ah, yes. The weather</i>
<i>will be fine to Chamonix.</i>

261
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,868
<i>From Chamonix to the tunnel,</i>
<i>it may snow.</i>

262
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,913
<i>And after the tunnel —</i>
<i>just a minute —</i>

263
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,916
This way I know
the weather all over Europe.

264
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:31,670
<i>Up to Turin, the weather will be fine.</i>
<i>Leave early to avoid snow.</i>

265
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,756
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>This is a wonderful service.</i>

266
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,591
<i>Thank you. Good-bye.</i>

267

268
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,236
<i>It's me.</i>

269
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,614
<i>Did you get any sleep?</i>
<i>- A little.</i>

270
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:03,285
<i>I didn't tell you this —</i>
<i>it may be easier on the phone —</i>

271
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,663
<i>but it was really wonderful.</i>

272
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:09,416
<i>We've never made love</i>
<i>so intensely, for so long.</i>

273
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:14,380
<i>We each learned something.</i>
<i>Me from you, you from me.</i>

274
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:18,717
<i>When I woke up, you were</i>
<i>still sleeping. Like a child.</i>

275
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,053
<i>- I'm older than you!</i>
<i>- By a year.</i>

276
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,347
- Two.
<i>- Okay, two.</i>

277
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:27,935
<i>But as I watched you, I got scared.</i>
<i>Where is this leading?</i>

278
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,729
<i>You're not in great spirits.</i>

279
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,857
<i>Nervous about your exams?</i>

280
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:36,652
<i>No, about what I'm going to do.</i>
<i>Will it be enough for you?</i>

281
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,779
<i>How about going bowling?</i>

282
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,990
<i>I just got all my books out.</i>

283
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,576
<i>But maybe you're right.</i>
<i>You got a coin?</i>

284
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,578
<i>Toss it.</i>

285
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,122
<i>Tails is bowling.</i>
<i>Heads is criminal law.</i>

286
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,170
<i>Tails. Bowling.</i>

287
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,715
<i>I'll study for an hour</i>
<i>and then call you.</i>

288
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,217
<i>- Or I'll call you.</i>
<i>- Okay, I'll wait.</i>

289
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,888
<i>If I go out,</i>
<i>it's just for cigarettes. Bye.</i>

290
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,604
You didn't listen?

291
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:18,319
Too bad. It was romantic.

292
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,488
I heard the beginning.

293
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,616
They're in love.

294
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,869
Yes.

295
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,664
He hasn't met the right woman yet.

296
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,375
How do you know?

297
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,962
I watch them sometimes
from my window.

298
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:44,094
You think I'm a bastard?
- Yes.

299
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,721
Come look.

300
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:53,812
That guy bought a telephone in Japan
that uses a different wavelength.

301
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,816
My radio can't pick it up.

302
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,860
Too bad.

303
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:05,324
I suspect he controls most
of the heroin trade in Geneva.

304
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,118
No one can touch him.

305
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,246
He never takes any risks.

306
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,338
You like him?
- Very much.

307
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,842
I'll call him.

308
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,304
You have his phone number?

309
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,500
You deserve to die.

310
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,768
What did I do?

311
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,188
Here's his phone number.

312
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:22,943
If you get the urge to assault him
verbally again, don't be shy.

313
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,374
<i>I turned out the lights at 10:00,</i>
<i>but I couldn't sleep.</i>

314
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,085
Next program.
Not very interesting.

315
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,797
<i>I kept tossing and turning,</i>
<i>and it kept hurting.</i>

316
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,091
<i>It still does.</i>

317
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,261
<i>I haven't shopped for groceries.</i>

318
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,265
<i>- I'm sorry, Mother.</i>
<i>- I have no milk or bread.</i>

319
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,602
<i>I bought you some.</i>
<i>I put it in the freezer.</i>

320
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:58,896
<i>I ate it all.</i>

321
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,190
<i>Stop it.</i>
<i>You didn't eat seven loaves</i>

322
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,776
<i>in four days.</i>
<i>I'm sick of this.</i>

323
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,447
You should go do her shopping.

324
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,283
You'd feel better.

325
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,542
Maybe she's the one
who'd feel better.

326
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,837
Why did you stop and pick up Rita?

327
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,882
Because I'd hit her.

328
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,301
She was bleeding.

329
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,970
Otherwise you'd have felt guilty.

330
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:36,975
You'd have had dreams
about a dog with its skull crushed.

331
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,061
Yes.

332
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,106
So who did you do it for?

333
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,322
There's no point doing
that old lady's shopping.

334
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,366
She has everything she needs.

335
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,828
She wants to see her daughter,
but her daughter won't come by.

336
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,996
She came by five times

337
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,083
when her mother faked a heart attack.

338
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,420
When she dies,
I'll have to notify the daughter,

339
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,840
because she won't believe
her mother now.

340
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,968
She doesn't believe her anymore.

341
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,682
You're wrong.

342
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,059
About what?

343
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,353
Everything.

344
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,691
You're wrong about everything.

345
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,572
People aren't bad.

346
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,323
It's not true.

347
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,034
Yes, it is.

348
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,662
They may be weak sometimes, but —

349
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,749
That boy who found out
his father wasn't his father —

350
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,210
was that your boyfriend
or your brother?

351
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:48,881
My brother.

352
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,549
How old is he?

353
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:53,802
Sixteen.

354
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,263
Has he been shooting up
a long time?

355
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,642
How did you know?

356
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,353
It wasn't hard to guess.

357
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,029
One can only feel pity for you.

358
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,747
Maybe you didn't know.

359
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,124
Your dog is going to have puppies.

360
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,142
- It's Valentine.
<i>- Hello, darling.</i>

361
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,144
Hi, Mom. Did Marc arrive?

362
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,356
<i>Two days ago, with his lovely girlfriend.</i>
<i>Do you know her?</i>

363
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:53,732
Yes. Marie.

364
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,735
<i>We're all together.</i>
<i>They're watching TV.</i>

365
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,779
I'm sorry I can't be there.

366
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,156
<i>Yes, too bad. It's like old times.</i>

367
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,949
<i>Your brother's a good boy.</i>

368
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,409
Can I talk to him?

369
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,119
<i>Marc! Here he comes.</i>

370
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,996
Call me, Mom. I love you.

371
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,625
<i>- Hi, Valentine.</i>
- Thanks for going there.

372
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:15,337
<i>At your service.</i>
<i>We're leaving tomorrow. I can't take it.</i>

373
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,964
Mom didn't see the paper?

374
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:21,176
<i>I don't think so.</i>
<i>She'd never believe it anyway.</i>

375
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:25,389
- You're right. You should go home.
<i>- Bye.</i>

376
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,521
Call me, Michel.

377
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,648
Please call.

378
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,069
<i>Did you see the picture?</i>

379
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,654
The picture?

380
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,781
Jacques?

381
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,450
<i>Isn't it great? You didn't see it?</i>

382
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,453
I forgot. I've had a hard day.

383
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,623
<i>- Come join us. It'll relax you.</i>
- Where?

384
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,588
Not bad.

385
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,963
Sorry to bother you,

386
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,008
but someone's played
a stupid prank and I can't get in.

387
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:36,181
Those Turkish kids.
Always causing trouble.

388
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:40,352
I don't know.
Someone stuck gum in the lock.

389
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,687
Tweezers.

390
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,949
<i>- It's me.</i>
- Michel...

391
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,202
<i>I just called.</i>
<i>There was no answer.</i>

392
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,373
Someone stuck gum in the lock.
I couldn't get in.

393
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,916
I heard the phone.

394
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,584
<i>Gum?</i>

395
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:09,381
I did an ad for chewing gum.
That must be why.

396
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:13,843
<i>You shouldn't do that work.</i>
<i>They're taking advantage of you!</i>

397
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,554
<i>Forget it.</i>

398
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,099
<i>Didn't you turn the machine on?</i>

399
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,562
I just want some peace.

400
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,732
A life of peace and quiet.

401
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,902
<i>Then I'm not your guy.</i>
<i>You won't have peace with me.</i>

402
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,823
<i>Did you meet someone?</i>

403
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,659
No, I'm waiting for you.

404
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,745
<i>Why didn't you pick up before?</i>

405
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,456
I told you. I couldn't get in.

406
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,500
<i>I understand.</i>

407
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,421
How are you?

408
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,715
<i>I'm going to Hungary next week.</i>

409
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,676
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

410
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:57,095
- I'm going to bed.
<i>- Then go ahead.</i>

411
00:50:57,847 --> 00:50:59,347
<i>Go on!</i>

412
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,435
Are you there?

413
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,479
Michel, are you there?

414
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,486
It's starting again...

415
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,803
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

416
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,138
No, I'm not.

417
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,015
<i>Well, get in bed!</i>

418
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,101
<i>Are you in bed?</i>

419
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,479
I'm taking a shower.
I was getting undressed.

420
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,606
<i>No one's helping you?</i>

421
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,570
<i>Valentine, are you there?</i>

422
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,947
No. Good night.

423
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:14,255
I knew you could do it.
Congratulations.

424
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,509
Did they ask the question?

425
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,887
The one in the book
you dropped in the street.

426
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,879
Don't you like it?

427
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,006
Very much.

428
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,845
What will be
the first judgment I sign with it?

429
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,624
Civil hearing in the case of...

430
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,294
the residents of Pinchat

431
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,255
versus Joseph Kern.
Please come inside.

432
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:44,906
I'd like number 432.
Van den Budenmayer.

433
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,325
Did I pronounce it right?
- Yes.

434
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,453
This one?

435
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,874
I just sold the last one.

436
00:54:56,794 --> 00:55:00,421
I'll have more this afternoon.
I'll set one aside if you like.

437
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,101
Whose newspaper is that?

438
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,811
Yours.

439
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:31,869
RETIRED JUDGE
IN INVASION-OF-PRIVACY CASE

440
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,387
Hello. I've come —

441
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,849
I saw the newspaper.

442
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,059
I want you to know I didn't tell a soul.

443
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,728
I know.

444
00:55:57,396 --> 00:56:00,523
Not a soul.
Not the police or anyone.

445
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,150
I know.

446
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,071
I know who it was.

447
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:09,824
Who?

448
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,160
Me.

449
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,913
You asked me to.

450
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,541
Won't you come in?

451
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,919
There's something
I'd like to show you.

452
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,608
One, two, three, four,

453
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,944
five, six... seven?

454
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,113
Seven.

455
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:53,826
Would you like some pear brandy?

456
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,545
I've had it for ages
but never had the occasion.

457
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:22,355
To my health.

458
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,238
Why did you do it?

459
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,116
Why did I turn myself in?

460
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,742
Yes.

461
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:40,581
To see what you'd do
when you saw it in the paper.

462
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,626
Did you think I'd come by?

463
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,671
After our last conversation,
I thought so.

464
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,590
Why?

465
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,809
Do you expect something from me?

466
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,102
Yes.

467
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:07,692
Before leaving the other day,
you spoke of pity.

468
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,529
I realized later it was disgust.

469
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,085
Would you sit down for a moment?

470
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:37,054
Would you smile for me?

471
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,771
You cried when you left here

472
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:47,481
the other day.

473
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:49,150
Yes, I did.

474
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,405
And I turned off my radio.

475
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,534
I sat down at my desk.

476
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:03,456
The fountain pen I'd used
all my life was out of ink,

477
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,208
so I took a pencil

478
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:09,420
and wrote letters
to my neighbors and to the police.

479
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:12,089
I mailed them that same night

480
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,926
while you were sound asleep.

481
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:17,220
I wasn't asleep.

482
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,140
I'd gone bowling.
- Bowling?

483
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,353
Do you remember
that couple's conversation?

484
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,355
The boy and the girl?

485
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:30,942
I remember.

486
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:34,320
They were going bowling
that evening too.

487
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,657
You might have been
right next to them.

488
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:42,161
Perhaps.

489
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,916
You didn't like her.

490
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,796
I was right. It's almost over.

491
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,593
You seem pleased.

492
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,686
Did you do something to end it?

493
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:16,654
Yes or no?

494
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:23,953
Because of my eavesdropping
and my trial,

495
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,080
the girl met another man.

496
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,988
Ladies and gentlemen...

497
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,827
She's been all alone since then.

498
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,455
I asked my brother to go see her.

499
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,041
He stayed three days.

500
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,548
I'm going to England in a week
for I don't know how long.

501
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,759
I'm abandoning my mother
and my brother.

502
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:22,178
He's a little worse every day.

503
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,597
I shouldn't go.

504
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,350
Go. It's your destiny.

505
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,769
You can't live your brother's life

506
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,562
for him.

507
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,070
I love him.

508
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,907
If only I could do something.

509
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:46,577
You can: Be.

510
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,580
What do you mean?

511
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,750
Just that: Be.

512
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,465
Do you like flying?

513
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,342
Then take the ferry.

514
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,887
I've never taken one.

515
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,556
It's less expensive and healthier.

516
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,850
It's a good idea.

517
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,611
Do you like it?

518
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,157
Today's my birthday.
- I didn't know.

519
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,454
Thirty-five years ago today,

520
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,207
at about this time — 5:00 p.m. —

521
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,960
I acquitted a man. A sailor.

522
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,133
One of my first big cases,
and I was going through a tough time.

523
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,638
I've since realized I made a mistake.

524
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:50,975
He was guilty.

525
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:58,232
I don't think I have any more bulbs.

526
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,971
What became of him?

527
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,640
I did my own investigation.

528
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:35,853
He got married
and had three children,

529
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,272
and a grandson not long ago.

530
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,317
He's living a peaceful life.

531
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,821
So you did the right thing.

532
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:51,410
And you did it well.

533
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,043
Don't you understand?

534
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:02,922
You saved him.

535
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,799
Perhaps.

536
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:10,137
But how many others
could I have acquitted?

537
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,931
Even if they were guilty?

538
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:16,644
Deciding what's true and what isn't
now seems to me...

539
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:20,189
to show a lack of humility.

540
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:23,150
Pride?

541
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,612
Yes, pride.

542
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,207
May I have another drop?

543
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,135
Here's to you.

544
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:56,267
If I were ever taken to court...

545
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:01,230
you think there are still
judges like you around?

546
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,857
You'll never be taken to court.

547
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,986
The courts don't deal
with the innocent.

548
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,615
See that?

549
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,285
That's the sixth window
they've broken,

550
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,787
even though
the wavelength's been changed

551
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:19,456
and it's impossible
to eavesdrop anymore.

552
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,585
Where's the broom?

553
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:24,920
In the kitchen closet.

554
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,694
Put the stone on the piano.

555
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,256
Aren't you afraid?

556
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,511
I ask myself
what I'd do in their place.

557
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,140
I'd do the same.

558
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,185
You'd throw stones?

559
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,438
In their place? Of course.

560
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,275
And that goes for everyone
I passed judgment on.

561
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:33,113
Given their lives, their circumstances,
I'd steal and kill and lie.

562
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,865
Of course I would.

563
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,620
It's only because

564
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,789
I was in my shoes, not theirs.

565
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,380
Is there anyone you love?

566
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:57,763
Have you ever loved?

567
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:07,064
Yesterday I had a dream —

568
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,610
I had a dream about you.

569
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,366
You were 40 or 50 years old...

570
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,453
and you were happy.

571
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,457
Do your dreams come true?

572
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:32,214
It's been years since I've had
a really pleasant dream.

573
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:21,805
Stay there!

574
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,726
I bought a ticket for the ferry.

575
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:16,355
I arrive in England next Wednesday...

576
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:21,777
at 7:30 a.m.

577
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,862
<i>Why the ferry?</i>

578
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,991
That way I can visit
my mother near Calais.

579
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,662
<i>I'll be there by 8:30 at the latest.</i>

580
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:34,665
<i>I'm happy you're coming.</i>

581
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,668
Michel, tell me...

582
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,711
do you love me?

583
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,463
<i>I think so.</i>

584
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:44,549
You love me, or you think you do?

585
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:46,426
<i>Same thing.</i>

586
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,931
The battery...

587
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:18,703
Auguste!

588
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,991
<i>Personalized weather reports.</i>

589
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:58,660
I've tried calling for a few days.

590
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:00,537
<i>I was sick. I'm sorry.</i>

591
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:04,124
What will the weather be
on the English Channel next week?

592
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,794
<i>Wonderful. Sunny, a slight breeze,</i>
<i>chilly in the morning.</i>

593
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,504
Why do you laugh?

594
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,632
<i>I'm heading there myself.</i>
<i>And beyond.</i>

595
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:13,925
For your work?

596
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,720
<i>No, for pleasure. On a yacht.</i>

597
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:19,514
- It's nice sailing.
<i>- Yes, very.</i>

598
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,434
- Will you be closing?
<i>- I'll have to.</i>

599
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:25,395
Too bad.
It was a good idea. Good-bye.

600
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:04,267
We said not to smile!

601
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,061
We said not to smile!

602
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:08,396
Be serious!

603
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:13,276
Could you send
an invitation to this address?

604
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,278
Just one person?

605
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:07,450
Everything okay?

606
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,370
Have a good time.

607
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:20,630
- Anyone got makeup remover?
- Here.

608
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:36,479
<i>Everyone noticed that guy.</i>

609
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:40,316
I kept staring at him
during the whole show.

610
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:06,885
You came.

611
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,221
Did you know
the invitation was from me?

612
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:12,015
I hoped it was.

613
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,476
Did you look for me?

614
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:16,936
During the entire show.

615
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,650
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I wanted to say good-bye.

616
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,945
Good-bye.

617
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,867
I'd like you to tell me in detail

618
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,952
about that dream you had.

619
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,582
You were 50 years old,

620
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,834
and you were happy.

621
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:42,629
In this dream...

622
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:46,299
was there anyone else?

623
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:48,968
There was.

624
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:51,804
Who?

625
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,852
You woke up...

626
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:01,564
and smiled at someone next to you.

627
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,316
I don't know who.

628
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,736
And that's what will happen...

629
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,031
in 20 or 25 years?

630
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:11,824
Yes.

631
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,207
What else do you know?

632
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,253
Who are you?

633
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,421
A retired judge.

634
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:31,094
It feels like something important
is happening around me...

635
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,097
and it scares me.

636
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,359
Is that better?

637
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,865
I used to come here often.

638
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:55,702
Where did you usually sit?

639
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:58,079
Where I sat today.

640
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:01,958
That's why you couldn't see me.

641
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:10,049
One day, during intermission,

642
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:13,511
the strap around my books broke.

643
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:18,808
One large book fell
all the way down...

644
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,686
somewhere around there.

645
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:27,066
It was just before my exams.
I ran down immediately.

646
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:31,362
The book had opened to a random page.
I read a few sentences.

647
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:34,782
It was the question
they asked during my exam.

648
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:38,828
Getting out of the house
did you good.

649
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,664
It recharged my battery.

650
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,000
It was dead.

651
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,503
The storm.

652
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,369
Pretty lousy coffee.

653
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:25,708
I was wondering
why you told me about that sailor.

654
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:29,170
You know why?

655
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:32,840
Yes.

656
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,558
Because...

657
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,898
there was something much more
important you couldn't tell me about.

658
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:54,904
About the woman you loved.

659
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,077
She betrayed you.

660
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:06,624
She betrayed you...

661
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:10,294
and you never understood why.

662
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:17,176
And you went on loving her
for a long time.

663
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,264
How do you know all this?

664
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,271
It wasn't hard to guess.

665
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:32,984
What was she like?

666
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:37,989
She was two years
ahead of me at the university.

667
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,327
She was blond...

668
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:45,997
delicate...

669
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,791
radiant...

670
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,918
with a long neck.

671
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:57,967
Her clothes were light-colored,
and all her furniture was too.

672
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:02,013
In the foyer there was
a mirror in a white frame.

673
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:07,810
It was in that mirror one night...

674
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:11,981
that I saw her white legs
spread wide...

675
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,985
with a man between them.

676
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:21,699
Why...

677
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,327
did that happen?

678
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:26,704
Do you know?

679
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,664
That man...

680
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,501
whose name was Hugo Holbling...

681
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,465
could give her what she wanted.

682
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,469
They left.

683
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,723
I followed them.

684
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:50,102
I crossed France
and the English Channel.

685
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:55,358
I felt humiliated.

686
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:01,155
Until the day
she died in an accident.

687
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:07,203
I've never been involved
with another woman since.

688
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:09,372
Yes...

689
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:12,083
I stopped believing.

690
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:16,295
Or maybe I never met the woman —

691
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:23,177
Perhaps I just never met you.

692
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,390
The story doesn't end there.

693
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,436
A while ago,

694
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,314
I was assigned a difficult case.

695
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,901
On the file was the name
of the defendant:

696
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,736
Hugo Holbling.

697
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,405
The same man.

698
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,074
He'd come back here.

699
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,915
I'm closing up.

700
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:57,336
Have you seen a woman
with some buckets?

701
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:03,384
The storm flooded
the wardrobe department.

702
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,345
If you see her,
tell her I'm upstairs.

703
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:15,104
You should have declined the case.

704
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,814
I didn't want to.

705
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,196
Back then I'd wanted to kill him.

706
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:29,243
And I would have,
if it would have changed anything.

707
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,372
But now...

708
01:27:33,624 --> 01:27:35,791
he awaited my verdict.

709
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:41,339
He'd been building
a covered market that caved in.

710
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,466
Several people died.

711
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:48,137
I found him guilty.

712
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,641
It was a perfectly legal sentence.

713
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,065
After that I asked for early retirement.

714
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:04,862
Did you see her?

715
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,325
I'm always running after her.

716
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:13,871
Milana!

717
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:24,173
There you are!

718
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:27,635
Give me those buckets.
They're too heavy for you.

719
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,144
You seemed to like my pear brandy.

720
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,022
Thank you.
I have another favor to ask.

721
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:42,942
I'll be gone two or three weeks.

722
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:45,528
I'll come see you when I'm back.

723
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:49,615
I'd like one of Rita's puppies.

724
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:55,037
Will the fashion show be on TV?

725
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,164
Probably.

726
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,667
I'll have to get one.

727
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,336
I have one I never use.

728
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:05,339
My brother could bring it by.
His name is Marc.

729
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:08,551
I'd like to meet him.
Until next time.

730
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,137
Good-bye.

731
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:17,476
Do you have your ticket with you?

732
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:46,690
Where do I go?

733
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:48,818
This deck. That corridor.

734
01:30:56,243 --> 01:30:59,286
- I'm a bit lost. F38?
- The deck above.

735
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:56,755
TRAGEDY ON THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
