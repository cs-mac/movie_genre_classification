1
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,340
Hey, Eru...

2
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,380
What world...

3
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,040
What sky are you looking at right now?

4
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,620
[subbed my shinees at tumblr]

5
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,980
Why?

6
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,340
Why are you painting flowers?

7
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,120
Because it's what I see.

8
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,620
Grass?

9
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,800
Yeah.

10
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,840
Trees?

11
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,940
Yeah.

12
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,920
Amazing!

13
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,360
Huh?

14
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,460
I see.

15
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,460
You can see anything, right, painter?

16
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,660
That's why you have a smiling face.

17
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,940
No...

18
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,720
What's wrong?

19
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,900
It's scary.

20
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,740
Scary?

21
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,700
Everyone says it's disgusting.

22
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,180
What is?

23
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,680
My face.

24
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,600
I don't mind it at all.

25
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,060
B- but...

26
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,680
I'm... not a painter.

27
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,500
Hm, I see.

28
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,940
Then why don't you become a painter?

29
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
Huh?

30
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,160
Okay? From today on you're a painter!

31
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,360
Can I watch you paint again, painter?

32
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,260
Then, see you again!

33
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,360
Hey!

34
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,280
What's your name?

35
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,080
Ovesu.

36
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,400
Ovesu?

37
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,680
Ovesu, huh.

38
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,520
And... and you?

39
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,540
Eru!

40
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,080
Eru.

41
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,880
Later.

42
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,700
Eru.

43
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,040
Okay? From today on you're a painter!

44
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,180
Eru!

45
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,780
What's wrong?

46
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,720
They died.

47
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,420
Papa and Mama.

48
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,040
Huh?

49
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,920
Their ship sank.

50
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,400
Papa and Mama...

51
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,360
What is that book?

52
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,960
Papa and Mama gave it to me.

53
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,840
Is that... me?

54
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,880
It's amazing.

55
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,620
- Hurry up and get lost!
- I'm sorry!

56
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,500
You're such an irritating child!

57
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,300
Seriously. We should've never taken you in!

58
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,000
Open it. Please open it, Auntie!

59
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,560
Open it! Open it!

60
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,780
Stop crying, Cinderella.

61
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,800
You always work hard.

62
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
You're a really good girl.

63
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,060
As a reward, I'll take you to the ball.

64
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,820
Uncle.

65
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,320
Are you okay?

66
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,260
Poor girl.

67
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,200
You can't win with her.

68
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,520
It'll be fine.

69
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,220
You're a good girl.

70
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,060
Stop crying, Cinderella.

71
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,600
You always work hard.

72
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,140
You're a really good girl.

73
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,900
As a reward, I'll take you to the ball.

74
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,380
Said the fairy godmother.

75
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,960
I remembered it.

76
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,040
Hey.

77
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,900
Aren't you lonely living by yourself?

78
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,980
Once in a while.

79
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,500
But... I have painting.

80
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,120
You always look like you're enjoying
yourself when you paint.

81
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,580
Huh?

82
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,320
Your cheeks are smiling.

83
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,300
Eru...

84
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,540
Are you lonely?

85
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,740
But not when I'm with you.

86
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,120
Then we're the same.

87
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,940
Is this me?

88
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,420
Wow!

89
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,700
Yeah.

90
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,720
It's beautiful!

91
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,100
Hey, Eru...

92
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,600
I decided to paint a picture.

93
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,900
I decided to paint your smiling face.

94
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,820
So that no matter how sad you are...

95
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,980
No matter how lonely you are...

96
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,200
You don't forget that smile.

97
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,820
Thank you.

98
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,920
Hey, did you know?

99
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,100
What everyone thinks of La vi an rose.

100
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,680
The land with no color.

101
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,060
That's what everyone calls it.

102
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,220
I can see it.

103
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,120
All types of colors.

104
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,900
I see.

105
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,580
You do, huh.

106
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,580
Have you ever heard of a place called Seravi?

107
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,540
No.

108
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,080
Papa told me about it a long time ago.

109
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,720
He said it's a gorgeous place with all kinds of colors.

110
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
Don't you want to see it?

111
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,360
I'm sure it has a lot of things that aren't here.

112
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,380
I want to see much more beautiful colors.

113
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,360
You don't need stuff like that.

114
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,460
To think that you're spending time
with that boy who's bad for you.

115
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,520
That guy.

116
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,860
Eru, I love you!

117
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,980
I love you more than anyone.

118
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,980
No!

119
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,360
What are you doing?

120
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,360
I'm the one who raised you until now.

121
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,840
Stop!

122
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,220
I'm sorry.

123
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,740
I lost all of your paintings.

124
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,080
I'm sorry.

125
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,460
Hey.

126
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,940
Did I smile?

127
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,560
Huh?

128
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,180
Did I truly smile?

129
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,400
Then paint it.

130
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,380
I won't lose it this time.

131
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,860
Ovesu.

132
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,040
Sorry...

133
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,740
Huh?

134
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,160
What's wrong?

135
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,280
Sorry.

136
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,480
Eru, do you have a moment?

137
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,460
Yes.

138
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,820
I have a favor to ask of you.

139
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,200
Okay.

140
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,280
I want you...

141
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,660
to die.

142
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,680
Huh?

143
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,700
You understand, right?!

144
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,080
If you don't, your uncle will be like that forever!

145
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,320
That's why, please die. Please die!

146
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,900
It's fine.

147
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,980
You just need to be declared dead.

148
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,960
You're new citizenship.

149
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,960
It's for Seravi.

150
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,600
I'm sure you'll make do there.

151
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,260
Seravi...

152
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,800
Your father worked there, right?

153
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,400
It's a good place.

154
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,940
Take this money, too.

155
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,580
It's what your parents left behind.

156
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
I'll give it all back.

157
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,800
Here.

158
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,220
Take it!

159
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,420
Give me back my husband.

160
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,680
I'm begging you! Please, please, I'm begging you...

161
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,640
You love him.

162
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,840
Thank you...

163
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,960
for everything.

164
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,220
It's only this place.

165
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,740
It never changes.

166
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,300
It's always nothing.

167
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,140
I wonder why...

168
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,460
The things I want changed, don't change.

169
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,560
Everyone I don't want to change, changes.

170
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,280
I won't change.

171
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,080
I won't.

172
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,280
I really...

173
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,260
loved your drawings.

174
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,280
Eru?

175
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,920
I really loved them.

176
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,820
Eru?

177
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,260
Eru.

178
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,160
Goodbye.

179
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,940
Goodbye, Ovesu.

180
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,760
Give that back!

181
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,000
Excuse me. That's mine.

182
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,480
Here.

183
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Thank you very much.

184
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
It's your first time here, right?

185
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,540
Huh?

186
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,620
You were fascinated by the town. Am I wrong?

187
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,720
You can't give off that kind of atmosphere.

188
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,920
You'll be taken advantage of.

189
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,680
You know...

190
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,340
When I first came to this town,
I had the same look in my eyes.

191
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,740
You're not originally from here?

192
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,880
No.

193
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,880
I wanted to act here, so I came.

194
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,100
Then you're an actor?

195
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,820
I do act, but I do everything from step one.

196
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,040
That's amazing.

197
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,460
And you?

198
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,900
What's the reason you came to this town?

199
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,960
No special reason...

200
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,580
Then why don't you join my troupe.

201
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,940
I've never even seen a play before.

202
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,220
It's okay. I'll show you the ropes.

203
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,080
My place is just over there. Want to come see it?

204
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,160
Just for a bit.

205
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,760
What do you think?

206
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,580
Do you understand that I wasn't trying to trick you?

207
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,060
You're definitely suited to be an actress.

208
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,900
I have an eye for these things.

209
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,880
If you join my troupe, we'll be
the best in Seravi- No...

210
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,840
I have a feeling we'll be able to
stand on an even larger stage.

211
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,260
Acting is a really wonderful thing.

212
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,960
If you get up on the stage, you'll become
a millionaire and even a princess.

213
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,580
Even a princess?

214
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,240
Yeah.

215
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,480
Okay. First, should we start with the basics?

216
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,440
Here.

217
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,540
Try drinking this coffee.

218
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,340
Huh?

219
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Come on. Try drinking it.

220
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,120
How does it taste?

221
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,500
What about the scent? The heat?

222
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,900
I didn't drink anything so I don't know...

223
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,580
Right?

224
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,200
But doing that is acting.

225
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,280
In other words, everything you've felt
until now, your senses remember.

226
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,300
What do you think is the most important thing in acting?

227
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,600
Being freed of your troubles.

228
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
That's the most important thing.

229
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,400
Ah... It's already this late.

230
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,520
Excuse me.

231
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,420
You don't have a place to stay, right?

232
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,600
If you'd like, you can sleep here.

233
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,300
Huh?

234
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,140
It's fine. I'll sleep over there, so rest assured.

235
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,220
Breakfast.

236
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,860
This bread is delicious.

237
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,560
I wanted you to try it.

238
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,600
The purpose of acting is to hold the mirror up to nature.

239
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,260
That's Hamlet.

240
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,740
No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come.

241
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,260
That's Macbeth.

242
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,560
You've gotten better.

243
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,660
- Raise your leg a bit more.
- Raise my leg...

244
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:32,220
And from earlier... Let me see your arm arm arm arm.

245
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,320
You look good when you smile.

246
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,520
When I'm with you, I feel happy.

247
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,020
It's been a really long time since I've laughed like this.

248
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,720
- Really?
- Yeah.

249
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,540
Do you have fun when you're with me?

250
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,340
Then...

251
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,960
Will you live with me?

252
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,460
Huh?

253
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,460
I want to see more of your smile.

254
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,300
Is it okay?

255
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,740
Being the best troupe in Seravi...

256
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:53,280
And traveling around the world.

257
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,780
What do you think? It's a wonderful dream, right?

258
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,820
Yeah.

259
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,700
And you?

260
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,360
Huh?

261
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,660
What's your dream?

262
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,900
My dream...

263
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,000
Your dream is my dream.

264
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
What's wrong?

265
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,420
This one will cost a bit.

266
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,720
Are you giving up?

267
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,520
I have no choice.

268
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,600
Dammit.

269
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
I got cocky.

270
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,820
Use this.

271
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,580
If it's for your sake.

272
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,020
Thank you.

273
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,020
I love you.

274
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,980
How's it going?

275
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,140
Can I look at the script?

276
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,980
Why?

277
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,860
I don't want to hold you back, so I
thought I should start practicing now.

278
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,420
What did you just say?

279
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,640
Hey. Hey, try saying that again!

280
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,280
I just wanted to see the script.

281
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,060
What do you know about my work?!

282
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,060
- It's hurts! Stop!
- What do you know?!

283
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,580
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

284
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,940
I'm sorry.

285
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,140
I'm in a slump and can't write anything.

286
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,920
Help me... Help me!

287
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Support me.

288
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,180
It's okay.

289
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,100
It'll be okay. You're not just anybody.

290
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,420
I'm sorry, too.

291
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,520
I'm sorry that I don't understand.

292
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,660
Thank you.

293
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,200
I love you.

294
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,200
I love you, too.

295
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,040
You actually believe what they said?

296
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,940
But this is the money you borrowed!
They said you used the money on gambling!

297
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,820
You're not writing at all!

298
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,620
It's all blank!

299
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,180
It's fine if I don't become an actress.

300
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,780
I'll be with you.

301
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,960
Are you telling me to give up?

302
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,600
Look at the reality...

303
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,700
Look at the reality!

304
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,440
I have talent!

305
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,480
Someone like you who has no talent has
to support someone like me who does.

306
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,920
Forever!

307
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,640
You were born for that reason.

308
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,980
Sorry...

309
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,060
I'm sorry.

310
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,300
It's because you said terrible things.

311
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,700
You won't change?

312
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,920
Will you always...

313
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,960
be like this?

314
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,220
Why do I have to change?

315
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,140
You and I will live together and love each other forever.

316
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,300
Forever.

317
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,120
You're happy, aren't you?

318
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,780
I'm sorry.

319
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,700
Sorry.

320
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,000
At that moment...

321
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,220
she lost her glass slipper.

322
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,120
Stop crying...

323
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Cinderella.

324
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,900
We don't need a customer like you!

325
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,980
What was that?!

326
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,260
You guys are the ones who suck at your jobs!

327
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,920
Don't think that just because you're a
customer you can get anyone to kneel!

328
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,060
Let's stop this, you're making my eyes hurt.

329
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,940
Dammit.

330
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,040
Geez.

331
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,920
What are you doing?

332
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,480
How did you get that bruise?

333
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,380
You're so cold.

334
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,140
It can't be helped.

335
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,040
Come inside.

336
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,240
Okay! Stand up on your own.

337
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
Do you plan on staying there forever?

338
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,040
Who is she?

339
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,260
A stray cat.

340
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,620
Again?

341
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,740
Introduce her to everyone first.

342
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,000
I know.

343
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,080
Thanks, owner.

344
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,380
Come on.

345
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,260
Just stay here for now and things will work out somehow.

346
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,640
Sorry, but can you leave a spot open?

347
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,920
Sit.

348
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,420
What's with that face?

349
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,400
Yeah.

350
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,800
I knew it was a nice face.

351
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,200
Okay. I can cover up this much.

352
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,780
I'm covering something up, too.

353
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,560
If this girl gets on the stage,
she'll gather customers for sure!

354
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,980
But she can't even get up on stage.

355
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,140
She'll get over that quickly.

356
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,740
Can you dance?

357
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,380
A little...

358
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,620
Starting tomorrow, your name is...

359
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,780
Black Cat.

360
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,580
The other day, that girl was given the name Black Cat.

361
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,680
- Huh?! What?
- Black Cat?

362
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,460
To think she was given the establishments name...

363
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,100
Unbelievable!

364
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,480
Enough already!

365
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,180
- He's always like that!
- What happened?

366
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,260
It's the owner.

367
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,340
The owner?

368
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,240
Since it's you, I'll tell you.

369
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,460
We're dating. The owner and I.

370
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,840
Don't tell the others.

371
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,620
Yet he always has his hands on other women.

372
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,500
Are you okay?

373
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,020
Did the owner do this?

374
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,160
I'm fine, I'm fine.

375
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,300
This always happens.

376
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,720
Always?

377
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,040
I don't want to say this, but...

378
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,760
It would be better to break up with him.

379
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,820
- A person who hits a woman can't be decent.
- Yeah, I know.

380
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,100
I know that, but...

381
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,560
He never hits my face.

382
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,120
Huh?

383
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,920
He likes this face of mine.

384
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,200
Isn't that strange?

385
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,620
I think he's amazing for making a place like this.

386
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,120
Yeah.

387
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,440
You know...

388
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,320
I thought I shouldn't, so I never asked...

389
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,900
But I want to know, afterall.

390
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,160
About you.

391
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,120
Not Black Cat. The real you.

392
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,580
- The real me?
- Ah!

393
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,740
Let's start with your name. What's your real name?

394
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,620
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

395
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,660
I won't ask for the impossible.

396
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,480
I want to tell you, too.

397
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,800
About the real me.

398
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,780
Okay! Then I'll ask to the end!

399
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,940
Okay.

400
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,100
It's raining?

401
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,160
Hey, you! It's a rainy night, you'll get dirty.

402
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,200
Let's go.

403
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,280
I'll leave first.

404
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,880
For crying out loud, you're too much.

405
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,120
You couldn't leave me alone either, Anna.

406
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,920
This and that are...

407
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,860
the same, huh?

408
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,840
He used to be banker and can do accounting.

409
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,660
Oh, really?

410
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:35,540
The owner said no at first, but after
talking to him he said it's okay.

411
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,440
That's why you're letting him stay in your room.

412
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,080
Don't tell me it's because he's your type.

413
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,220
No! I've been hurt before.

414
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:51,060
And that was a little tough.

415
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,960
Tough?

416
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,120
Yeah.

417
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,340
Um...

418
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,780
Why are you doing this?

419
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,340
Huh?

420
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,000
You helped me find a job...

421
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,800
And gave me a place to stay.

422
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,400
You told me before, right?

423
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,980
That no one would believe you.

424
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,040
I used to be like you.

425
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,460
I gave everything to the person I loved...

426
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,600
But when it became no good I ran away.

427
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,120
You and I are the same.

428
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,640
I'm no good.

429
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,200
And so I joined the establishment.

430
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,520
So you have to work hard.

431
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,380
Is that so?

432
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,840
Yeah.

433
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,560
That's why I'm sure you'll be able
to make a fresh start, too.

434
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,380
Thank you very much.

435
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,980
I want to quickly make a fresh start, too.

436
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,280
I'll do my best.

437
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,940
Yeah.

438
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,040
Then, goodnight.

439
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,340
Goodnight.

440
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,900
Excuse me. Here's your whiskey.

441
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,400
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

442
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,540
Ah, would you like a drink?

443
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,040
Thanks for everything.

444
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,800
It's good that you found a place to live.

445
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,900
It's because of what you said.

446
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,340
Thank you very much.

447
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,660
See you again, okay?

448
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,480
Bye.

449
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,560
You... aren't a useless person.

450
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,140
You're a very kind...

451
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,940
and very wonderful person.

452
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,000
If it's with you, I'm sure I'll be able to start my life over.

453
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,740
Probably...

454
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,820
I'm sorry! For someone like me to say that...

455
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,360
Thank you.

456
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,960
Me too...

457
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,140
I might be able to start over if it's with you.

458
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,020
What's the matter?

459
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,020
We were tricked.

460
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,440
He took all of the money.

461
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,100
Huh?

462
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,780
That guy.

463
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,840
That guy?

464
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,960
The man you brought in.

465
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,080
There's no doubt it was him.

466
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,820
Is that true?

467
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,360
Seems so.

468
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,420
I'm so sorry!

469
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,900
I'll work hard to earn the money back!

470
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,260
- Yeah! If we work hard, we can do it!
- No.

471
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,680
I want you to stop, Black Cat.

472
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,720
Huh?

473
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,920
Just as I thought, you're too soft.

474
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,600
Someone who looks out for everyone
can't survive in this world.

475
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,680
Now. Let's go make money.

476
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,000
You need to find a real place for yourself.

477
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,640
Do you have a place to go?

478
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,640
You don't have a place to go home to, right?

479
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,320
I'll make do somehow.

480
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,780
The asked the owner.

481
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,540
He said you should be fine there.

482
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,400
Thanks.

483
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,840
If you're ever in a jam, come back any time!

484
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,700
Don't take it all on by yourself!

485
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,380
Okay.

486
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,340
I'm glad I met you.

487
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,920
Really glad.

488
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,660
Me too.

489
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,220
Every day was like a dream.

490
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,740
I've never had this much fun before.

491
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,880
It's fine.

492
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,620
You'll be fine.

493
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,940
There are a ton of fun things in store for you!

494
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,100
You'll be really happy!

495
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,920
Yeah.

496
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,900
Take care of yourself...

497
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,460
Eru.

498
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,240
- Thank you very much.
- I'll come again.

499
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,420
Welcome.

500
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,520
- Here you go.
- Thank you!

501
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,900
Ah, wait.

502
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,840
Here.

503
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,420
Wow! How cute!

504
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,140
- Pick the one you like.
- Okay!

505
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,060
Thank you!

506
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,280
Thanks for always doing this.

507
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,920
Ready to go?

508
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,880
Yeah.

509
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,660
Thank you very much.

510
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,500
We're done for the day.

511
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,700
Um...

512
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,640
Here. If you'd like...

513
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,540
How cute.

514
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:55,760
What a relief...

515
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,380
It's my first time seeing your happy face.

516
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,720
I always thought you hated me.

517
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,540
I don't hate you.

518
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,500
Then, would you stay here?

519
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,240
You don't have to answer right away.

520
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,340
It's just...

521
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,060
I'd like you to think about it.

522
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,840
Um...

523
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,560
I want you to stay with me forever.

524
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,020
I'm sorry.

525
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:48,940
Um...

526
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,560
I can't give you an answer right away...

527
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,940
Will you wait a bit?

528
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,680
Of course.

529
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,680
Will you...

530
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,640
make me happy?

531
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,000
I'm happy...

532
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,420
That I was able to meet someone like
you who's so beautiful and pure.

533
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,600
- Welcome.
- Hello.

534
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,520
How cute! Are these animals?

535
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,800
- A puppy.
- Yes.

536
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,840
What is this?

537
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,420
A pig.

538
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,420
That's a pig?

539
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,500
It moved.

540
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,320
I want to meet you already.

541
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,680
Mama will love you a lot.

542
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,920
I'll give you lots and lots of love.

543
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,620
We're closed...

544
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,800
I finally found you.

545
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:58,100
Ever since you disappeared...

546
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,020
my life has become a mess.

547
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,820
Let's go home, Eru.

548
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,160
What is it?

549
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:08,040
Let's go home.

550
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,460
- Come back and support me again.
- No...

551
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,580
No!

552
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,760
- What is it?!
- Stop!

553
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,340
Hey, what are you doing?!

554
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,700
Oh, your husband.

555
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,380
I didn't know.

556
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,720
The woman I've been looking for this whole time is here.

557
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,120
I'll take her back.

558
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,400
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!

559
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,200
- She has to support my talent!
- What are you talking about?!

560
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,720
Do you even know?

561
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:40,700
How this woman has been living until now.

562
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,820
Hm?

563
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:46,140
I've been looking for you ever since,
and I was shocked at what I found out.

564
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:46,980
Stop...

565
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:51,420
She met a man at a cabaret, stole money,
and lived a good life.

566
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,760
Stop!

567
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,640
And as for what's in her stomach.

568
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,240
Who knows whose child it is.

569
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,780
Is that true?

570
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,720
Of course not.

571
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,820
So you really didn't know anything.

572
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,360
No...

573
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,240
- Don't listen to what he's is saying!
- This person...

574
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:25,380
How did you come to live with him again?

575
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:32,140
We were in love.

576
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:38,500
Sir, could you leave the two of us alone for a moment?

577
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,160
Don't go, dear.

578
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,240
I'm going out for a bit.

579
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:56,540
Wait. Wait! Dear!

580
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:04,140
You have to support me forever.

581
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,080
You haven't changed at all.

582
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,380
Let me go!

583
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,280
In that case.

584
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,080
Die right here.

585
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,700
I'll follow you right after.

586
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,840
No!

587
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,840
I have talent!

588
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,780
If I have you...

589
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,940
If only you support me!

590
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,620
Right now!

591
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:50,880
If you support me...

592
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,000
What's wrong?

593
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:08,780
What's wrong?

594
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,100
I'm sorry.

595
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,260
Why do I have to change?

596
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,240
You and I...

597
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,680
We were gonna live together and
love each other forever, right?

598
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,740
Forever.

599
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,300
It's okay...

600
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,900
It'll be fine.

601
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,680
I'll give you lots and lots of love.

602
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,000
A lot...

603
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,620
No!

604
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:04,300
Hey, Eru...

605
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,760
Have you found it yet?

606
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:16,280
The many colors you spoke of wanting to see.

607
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:21,680
I'm still the only one who can see it.

608
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,340
I'm gazing at so many colors.

609
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,400
If you're ever in a jam, come back anytime!

610
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,400
Don't take it all on by yourself!

611
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,020
Anna...

612
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,680
What happened?

613
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,820
What?

614
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,300
What is this?

615
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,000
He hit me.

616
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,100
On my face.

617
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,340
This person... hit my face.

618
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,820
It was the first time he hit my face. That's why...
That's why it turned out like this!

619
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,060
I mean that's a big deal, right?! Right?

620
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,420
Anna!

621
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,360
Are you...?

622
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:39,980
pregnant?

623
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,060
Did the owner know?

624
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,020
Yeah.

625
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,240
That's why... he gave me this.

626
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,920
Look!

627
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,500
He gave me this...

628
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,440
- And yet...
- That's why!

629
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,520
Huh?

630
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,740
That's why he hit your face.

631
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:07,420
Huh?

632
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,500
Because of the child in your stomach.

633
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,280
That's why he hit your face!

634
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,120
Ah!

635
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,500
I see.

636
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,660
I feel refreshed.

637
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,120
Sorry.

638
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,740
I was wrong.

639
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,700
What are you doing?!

640
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,000
I have to go, too. I have to go to where he is!

641
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
You want to have this baby, right? Get it together!

642
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:47,600
Sorry.

643
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,040
I killed him.

644
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,220
Huh?

645
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,280
Do you understand?

646
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,900
I'm the one who killed the owner.

647
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,780
- Don't say strange things.
- I'll tell the police.

648
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:07,040
I'll say I had a a grudge or something. Anything!

649
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,480
- You can't possibly do something like that!
- I'm doing it!

650
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:13,060
But you'll get caught.

651
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,560
The child in your stomach...

652
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,020
You don't want it to be a criminals child, right?

653
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,460
Hey, do you remember?

654
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:27,040
When we talked about the land with no color.

655
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,100
The place you grew up?

656
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,680
Stay hidden there.

657
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,820
But...

658
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,220
- I can't do this, afterall. You'll-
- It's okay!

659
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,800
It's okay.

660
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,800
Live for that childs sake, Anna.

661
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,120
I'm sorry.

662
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,980
Just promise me one thing.

663
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:05,220
The child you give birth to...

664
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,320
Give it lots and lots of love.

665
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,860
Lots... and lots.

666
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,500
Once upon a time...

667
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:08,660
there was a very beautiful and kind girl.

668
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:17,600
One night...

669
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:25,020
A prince invited her to a ball.

670
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,820
First...

671
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,600
she went on her pumkin carriage.

672
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,640
But...

673
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,800
once the clock strikes midnight...

674
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,240
the magic will lose it's effect.

675
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:51,760
At that moment...

676
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,560
she lost her glass slipper.

677
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,700
Stop crying...

678
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,420
Cinderella.

679
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,940
Stop...

680
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,620
Hey, Eru...

681
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,380
What world...

682
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,420
What sky are you looking at right now?

683
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,940
Eru...

684
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:04,100
There's...

685
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,920
a future I want to show you.

686
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:20,140
Wake up.

687
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,500
Are you okay?

688
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,940
You're...

689
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:34,600
Eru-san, right?

690
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,900
How do you know that name?

691
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,000
I finally found you.

692
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,000
It fits perfectly.

693
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:17,280
Who... are you?

694
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,800
That ring...

695
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:25,110
Are you...

696
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,150
possibly...

697
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,200
Rino.

698
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,680
I'm...

699
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,550
Anna's daughter, Rino.

700
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:45,440
From back then...

701
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,460
I've been looking for you for a long time.

702
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:53,080
Now, let's go.

703
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:59,060
He... doesn't have much time.

704
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:01,910
He?

705
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,370
Ovesu.

706
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:12,330
He's waiting for you.

707
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,660
That's why...

708
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:18,130
Let's go home together.

709
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:21,480
To where Ovesu is.

710
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,540
What's wrong?

711
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,450
I'm afraid.

712
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:46,080
It'll be fine.

713
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:49,110
Ovesu is looking forward to seeing you.

714
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:52,880
But he's already...

715
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,940
He said that he wanted to paint.

716
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:06,680
Always, for you.

717
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,020
But, he couldn't paint.

718
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:15,570
Your uncle misunderstood, right?

719
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:20,450
Your relationship with Ovesu.

720
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:35,310
To think that you're spending time
with that boy who's bad for you.

721
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,220
Then paint it.

722
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,510
I won't lose it this time.

723
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,200
Sorry.

724
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,340
Then...

725
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,910
I took that away from Ovesu?

726
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:11,800
He's painting something himself.

727
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,220
Something no one can take away.

728
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,680
I can't do this, afterall.

729
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:29,970
What face do I make when I see him?

730
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:34,880
Painting was everything to Ovesu.

731
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:40,450
Yet I...

732
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:44,250
It's my fault.

733
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:47,600
He's been waiting for you this entire time.

734
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:57,740
He believe that you would come back some day.

735
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,650
Always, in that place.

736
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,280
Let's go.

737
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:46,770
From here... go in by yourself.

738
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,170
Go on.

739
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,570
Ovesu.

740
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:19,540
Eru.

741
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:24,970
I've completely become a grandma, right?

742
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:29,940
You're absolutely beautiful.

743
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,200
I'm sorry.

744
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,710
I'm sorry...

745
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:45,740
Why... are you apologizing?

746
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:48,710
Because you could see it...

747
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:58,340
What I took away from you...

748
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:04,420
I'm painting even now.

749
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:08,800
I always have.

750
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:13,770
Right?

751
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:20,000
You're right.

752
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,540
You're right...

753
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,510
You're a painter.

754
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,200
The world best painter.

755
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:40,170
It's all thanks to you.

756
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:42,050
Huh?

757
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,880
It's thanks to you...

758
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,000
that painting...

759
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,800
gave me the strength to live.

760
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,680
Ovesu...

761
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:00,250
Thank you...

762
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:03,800
Eru.

763
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,080
That's not...

764
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:14,280
I didn't do anything...

765
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,800
I didn't do anything.

766
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:28,140
I haven't given you anything in return.

767
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,110
So tell me, Ovesu...

768
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:40,450
What should I do?

769
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,910
I think that...

770
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:50,200
you were surely happy.

771
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:56,050
Rather than the things you've been told to do...

772
01:35:56,050 --> 01:36:01,400
the things you've done yourself...

773
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:05,480
is much more important.

774
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:12,710
That's why think...

775
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:15,940
of all the things you've done.

776
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,340
The things I've done?

777
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,850
See?

778
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:30,140
The days you lived...

779
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,770
weren't so bad, right?

780
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:51,510
I wonder if you'll...

781
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:54,910
smile.

782
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,370
Hey, Eru...

783
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,850
Right now I'm...

784
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:11,050
very happy.

785
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:15,740
The best day of my life...

786
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:20,370
is when I hold your hand in this room...

787
01:37:20,370 --> 01:37:23,370
and fall asleep.

788
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,480
Ovesu...

789
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:24,710
Ovesu!

790
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:28,420
Hey...

791
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:37,570
Ovesu!
