- It's not officially a crime scene yet.
- Here's a thought.

60
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:22,502
Why don't we double the perimeter

61
00:11:22,612 --> 00:11:24,443

down there?

and a strand
of what appears to be leg wire.

69
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:43,252
About a million of those blue particles
washed up on the Algiers side.

70
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:45,846
It's probably from
a plastic container or a barrel.

71
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:47,192
ANFO?

72
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,055
Most likely.
There was post-blast residue

73
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,061
under the Crescent City Bridge.

74
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:53,723
The insulation on the leg wire
will inform us

75
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:56,164
of who the manufacturer
of the blasting cap is.

76
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:57,860
Then we go after
the switching mechanism

77
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,460
and the bomb's power source.

78
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:02,506
We probably don't need to wait for
the lab to tell us what we already know,

79
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,667
that this is an explosive and a trigger.

I'm Jack McCready, special agent
in charge of this investigation.

132
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:38,120
First, let me say our hearts go out

133
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,630
to all of those affected by this tragedy.

134
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:45,225
Early estimates
place the number of casualties

135
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:49,296
at 543 men, women and children.

136
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:52,937
Now, Lord knows this city has seen
its share of pain,

137
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:54,808
but unlike Katrina,

138
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,812
this disaster was not an act of nature.

139
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:01,552
After careful review of evidence
retrieved at the scene,

140
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:05,145
we have concluded
this was a deliberate act of terrorism,

141
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:08,654
and the President concurs
with our assessment.

142

we have to ask for your patience,

It's a unique and complicated
crime scene.

There's no baggage checks.
There's no flight data recorder.

146
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:22,731
There are maximum casualties,

147
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:26,538
and most of the evidence
is under 100 feet of muddy water.

148
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:29,876
There are no shortcuts.

149

- You just missed him.

150

- Took the streetcar.

- What? Streetcar?
- Hey, don't look at me.

Hey, Doug. I know you got
your hands full right now.

156
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:57,236
Yeah, that's okay.
What do you got for me, Bob?

157
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:59,333
Well, a couple of kids found a woman

158
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:01,344
face down in the waters
off Algiers Point.

159
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:03,573
She was burned over 30% of her body.

160

Right, well, you're gonna see
a lot of that over the next few weeks.

We've just set up ECC.
Just have Crime Scene bag it for us.

162
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:12,848
Well, we already done that.
The body's at the ME's right now.

163
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,585
Crime Scene's already been there?

164
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,388
Yeah, they've been and gone.

165
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:17,860
Well, exactly what time
did this woman wash up on shore?

166
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,260
Kid called it in at 10:42 a.m.

You mean 11:42, don't you?

No, I mean 10:42.
I got the sheet right in front of me,

PHIL: Lmmediately evident is the
focal charring of the limbs and torso.

171
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,379
Anterior face, neck and chest
are intact,

172
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,781
though swollen
from apparent immersion in water.

173
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:01,728
Hold her hand for me, will you?
Right here.

There we go.

175
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,302
Each digit of the right hand
has been severed

176
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,838
between the middle
and distal phalanges. Thanks.

177
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:14,805
Angle of shearing indicates
a single sharp-force trauma,

178
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,144
possibly caused by shrapnel.

179
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:20,741
No. No,
it's too even to be shrapnel trauma.

180
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:25,022
Posterior charring
gives off a strong odor,

181
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:28,093
suggesting perimortem immersion
in burning fuel.

- Accelerant, maybe?
- I don't know.

184
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:33,831
If she was that close to the bomb,

185
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,924
she probably wouldn't be
laying here now.

and she was supposed to pick me up,
but she wasn't there.

220

I thought maybe she just overslept,

and I went straight to her house.

Her and Alan's car was gone,

maybe she'd just finally sold it.

- He moved to Montreal.
- Okay.

No, that's okay. But if you have keys

The blast wave initiated here,
hit the bulkhead

and propagated fore and aft
along the path of least resistance

until it hits this access hatch.

S TALHUTH: The blast wave continues

282

into the engine room,
bursting the fuel tanks.

283
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,556
This utility shaft here
acts like a chimney,

284
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,151
draws the thermal components
into the engine room,

285
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:20,322
which ignites the fuel vapor,
causing a secondary explosion

of far greater magnitude.

287
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:26,101
PRYZWARRA: Essentially, the initial
device turns the whole ferry into a bomb

288

and detonates it.

289
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:29,867
And so our early guess

290
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:32,375
is that the bomb vehicle
was a minivan or SUV.

291

- Possibly red or tan.

This afternoon, I witnessed an autopsy

302
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,069
of a young woman who washed up
off the Poland Wharf.

303
00:26:04,242 --> 00:26:07,609
Heavy fuel burns,
traces of PETN on her face.

304
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:10,910
PETN, that's the base explosive
used by domestic terrorists.

305
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:15,580
She also lost several fingers
in what appeared to be blast damage.

306
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:17,043
Appeared?

307
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:20,056
That's right. I checked the tide tables
against the position of the blast.

308
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:22,752
For her to have washed up
that early and that far upriver,

309
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:26,319
she would've had to have been killed
two hours before the ferry exploded.

310
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:27,659
Before?

311
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,465
She died before the explosion?

312
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,301
She died before the explosion, yeah.
Her name is Claire Kuchever.

313
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:38,604
She washed up before the explosion
and against the tide.

314
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:41,738
- Do you have a scenario?
- Yes, I do.

315
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:45,613
I believe that somebody abducted her
in her home, taped her mouth,

316
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:48,515
bound her wrists, burned her alive,
dumped her in the river

317
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,646
so she would appear to be
just another disaster victim.

318
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:54,216
A disaster that hadn't happened yet.

319
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:56,886
But the PETN tells us

320
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:59,657
that the bomber came in direct contact
with the victim.

00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,863
Good question. Her SUV is missing.

324
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,734
It's a tan and red Bronco.

325
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:14,437
It could have been stolen
to drive the bomb to the ferry.

Oh, one more thing.

Nope. Nothing, really, but his job.

It's called Snow White.

400
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,100
Our primary data comes from
seven orbiting satellites,

but at any given time, as many as four
are surveilling one area.

look at four days ago?

to the day of the explosion?

The only thing that matters

412
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:28,141
is that we have exactly one look
at any one time.

413
00:33:29,147 --> 00:33:31,843
Yeah. We can't go back 10 minutes,
you know?

414
00:33:31,983 --> 00:33:34,975
Can't look back and see
if there was a second gunman.

415

We can't watch the agent
buying 10 pairs of cargo pants in 1983.

00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:42,490
All right? But given enough lead time,

417
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:44,858
we can look anywhere
within the target area, all right?

418
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:48,831
It's the when that's always constant.
It's always four days and six hours ago.

419
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:50,424
Always. You understand?

420
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:54,869
It's like a single trailing moment of now,
in the past.

421
00:33:56,107 --> 00:34:01,067
Okay. So if you can't move forward
or backward in time,

422
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:03,147
how is it the image keeps
speeding up like that?

423
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:06,479
It's not the image that's moving faster,
it's just our shifting point of view.

424
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:09,348
The passage of time remains constant,
but we can shift our point of view

425
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:11,684
within the data stream
as fast as we want.

426
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:15,549
- You understand?
- Yeah. Yeah. No.

427
00:34:15,894 --> 00:34:16,883
Yeah, I know.

428
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:19,156
So four days from...
Well, actually, three days from now,

429
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,563
since it's after midnight,
you'll be able to look back

how they did it
and what they did it with.

Yeah, you got it.

433
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,864
The only thing is,
you need to tell us where to look,

434
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:33,240
'cause, you know, we could miss it.

could strike again.

All right, match the viewer settings
to the signal.

- DENNY: All right, dazzle me.

Right. What do you got?

We got some bloody cotton swabs
and gauze strips in the bathroom,

And, oh, hey, Carlin?

how to investigate a crime scene?

Anybody brushing their teeth?

No. Just a couple agents,

cased the ferry first,
but we don't know when.

right in the face and not know it's him.

No, it's far too much data

That could ruin his plans.
Shanti, I want to see this guy.

628
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:09,132
No good. It's an outdoor phone booth.
Three miles out of range.

629
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,290
CLAIRE: I hope to hear from you.

630
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,461
Can we get someone out there
with a goggle rig?

631
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,974
What's that do? Extend the range?

632
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,941
Yeah, it's immediate line of sight.

633
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,638
But we can use it to gather data
outside the target area.

634
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,078
Provided there's any data to gather.

635
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,843
How long is this guy
gonna be at the phone booth?

636
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,247
Not long.

637
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,944
- Have a good night.
- Thanks.

638
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:31,020
Bye.

639
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,755
Story of my life.

640
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,415
Yeah, story of my life, too.

641
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:37,425
All right, now we heard
the voice of our bomber,

642
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:39,324
now we're gonna go after him
the old-fashioned way.

643
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,624
Can we get video surveillance
on that phone booth?

644
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,929
We can access all surveillance
available to any government agency.

645
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,303
Okay, this is from the ATM camera
across the street.

646
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:01,976
All right. Let's fast-forward to the exact
time of his phone call to Claire.

647
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,956
Where are we supposed to be looking?

648
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,820
Behind the guy on the left.

649
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,919
Can you enhance it, Gunnars?

650
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,163
GUNNARS: Not enough for an ID.

651
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,496
Wait, go back.
Can you rewind it just a little bit?

652
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:23,095
Stop. What is that on the ground?

653
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,269
Looks like a camcorder bag, maybe.

654
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:30,073
- We have facial recognition software?
- Yeah.

655
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,374
Let's use it on the bag.

656
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,881
Cross-match it to all the bags
on the south side of the city

657
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,851
in the 48 hours leading up
to the explosion, all right?

658
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,617
GUNNARS: Don't think it's ever been
used this way.

659
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,920
Yeah, that's kind of a simple image
to go for a match.

660
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,892
Well, we got nowhere else to go.

661
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:53,030
- PRYZWARRA: Look, same bag.
- Bingo.

662
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:00,708
Okay, freeze it.

663
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,538
Yeah, looks like the same guy, too.
Where is this?

664
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,049
Security camera
at the Algiers ferry dock.

665
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,550
Okay, when is this?

666
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:13,111
Two nights before the explosion.
Seven hours from now.

667
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,985
Two nights before the explosion
is seven hours from now?

668
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:20,291
Seven hours from now, we will be able
to access this point in our time window.

669
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,591
CARLIN: Gotcha.

670
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:34,572
Kind of creepy, seeing that lady's life
go down in flames.

671
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,102
Yep.

672
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,871
Makes you appreciate life.

673
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,511
I suggest you go home
and jump on whoever you got.

674
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,213
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Nobody home.

675
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,413
How'd you let that happen?

676
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,089
Everything you have, you lose, right?
Mother, father, gone.

677
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,825
Good looks, Pryzwarra, gone.

678
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,329
Loved ones gone in a second.

679
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,767
That's what this job teaches you,
doesn't it?

680
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,463
No matter what,

681
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:06,673
no matter how hard you grab
onto something, you still lose it, right?

682
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,440
Well, we're gonna grab onto this guy
in a couple hours.

683
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,472
We're gonna nail this son of a bitch.

684
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,918
What's wrong?

685
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,190
No matter what, we still lose her.

686
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,754
Right?

687
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:28,565
WO MAN ON RADIO: Dot-com for
a link to the FEMA Web site.

688
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,430
WO MAN ON RADIO: Dot-com for
a link to the FEMA Web site.

689
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,196
MAN: Military helicopters that have
served as an emergency force

690
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,295
are leaving the city. Hundreds
of thousands of New Orleans residents

691
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,931
have been unable to come back home,
and entire neighborhoods...

692
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,270
Did you talk to him?

693
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:43,835
...are still waiting to rebuild.
This while governmental agencies...

694
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:45,947
GIRL: Oh, no.
CLAIRE: What is it?

695
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,985
Mom asked me to say a prayer
for David this morning, but I forgot.

696
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,382
- Okay.
- Mom is gonna be so mad at me.

697
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,390
She's not gonna be mad at you.
Come on.

698
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,422
We'll just say one now, all right?

699
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:00,519
- It's too late.
- It's never too late, sweetie.

700
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:04,057
We'll just pray
that David had a good day, all right?

701
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:08,834
How about this? You pray for David,
and I'll pray for my mom, okay?

702
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:11,066
- Okay.
- All right.

703
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,904
(KISSIN G)

704
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,979
- What's going on?
- Give it a second.

705
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,717
- DENNY: Gunnars.
- It's rebooting. It's coming back.

706
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,690
- Are we online?
- Wait.

707
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:31,783
- Are we online?
- Gunnars!

708
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,920
- What the hell's going on?
- Shanti, are we back online?

709
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,327
SHANTl: I don't know.
Something broached the field.

710
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:37,866
- What broached the field?
- That broached the field, right there.

711
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,664
That broached the field, right there.
That's what broached the field.

712
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,761
Now, you wanna tell me
what the hell this thing is?

713
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,274
It's not surveillance, Paul.
It's not electronic thermal imaging.

714
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,038
You guys have figured out a way
to look into the past. Yes or no?

715
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,113
- No.
- You're lying.

716
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,681
- You're lying, and you know it.
- I've told you everything I can.

717
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:55,512
She saw it, Paul.
I pointed this thing at her just now,

718
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,315
and she responded to it
from four and a half days ago.

719
00:50:58,421 --> 00:51:00,685
- Explain that to me.
- All right.

720
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,991
CARLIN: Somebody explain it!

721
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,151
Hit it, Shanti.

722
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,629
For three years,
Cambridge has been working

723
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,724
for National Reconnaissance
on an R & D grant.

724
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:12,893
Okay.

725
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,403
We were attempting
to use concentrated bursts of energy

726
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,939
to enhance the sensitivity
of optical telescopes.

727
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,440
In the process, we had a breakthrough.

728
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,977
Given enough energy,
we could warp the very fabric of space.

729
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,638
I said explain it to me, not talk science.

730
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,375
- They found a way to...
- Look, I'll tell you what.

731
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:29,145
Why don't you guys just keep talking?
I'll just sit here

732
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,379
until you figure out
what it is you really wanna tell me.

733
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:34,548
They found a way
to fold space back onto itself.

734
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:40,589
All right, look. We're used to viewing
space as flat, right?

735
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:41,686
- Like this piece of paper.
- Right.

736
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,164
To see something from a distance,
light has always had to travel

737
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,825
the long way
across the flat space in between.

738
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,335
But given what I was trying to explain,

739
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,201
we can fold the space,
bring the target closer to us,

740
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,138
create what's known as
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

741
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,268
otherwise known as a wormhole,
suspend it via gravitational field.

742
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:56,606
- That's what we're looking at?
- That's it.

743
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,647
What's on the other end of the bridge?

744
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,272
Claire's house.

745
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,276
Wow.

746
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,445
Basically, we're folding space
in a higher dimension

747
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:08,217
to create an instantaneous link
between two distant points.

748
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,316
- Instantaneous?
- Well, that's what we hoped for

749
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,657
and that's what we expected.
But the electrical force...

750
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:15,253
We used huge amounts of energy
to create this bridge.

751
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:16,491
All right, how huge?

752
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,693
You remember that little blackout
we had a few years back?

753
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,860
- Yes, I do.
- New York blamed Canada.

754
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,130
- Right.
- Canada blamed Michigan.

755
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,138
Half the Northeast.
You're saying you guys...

756
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,265
- Fifty million homes. Right.
- My bad.

757
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,036
Well, I still say we blame Canada, but...

758
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,509
Okay, so why can't I see this bridge?

759
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:32,013
It's not visible to the human eye.
I mean, it's real, though.

760
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,309
It's just as real and just as solid

761
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,815
as a cell phone signal or a radio wave.

762
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,216
Right. Well, I don't know
how a cell phone works.

763
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,915
I just know how to use it.
So how do we use this?

764
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:42,589
We can look back four and a half days.

765
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,525
- And what, we can look anywhere?
- Limited radius.

766
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,688
Right, right, right.
Looking into the past.

767
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,788
In a sense,
we're always looking in the past.

768
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:52,527
Even light reflected
from yourself in the mirror

769
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,103
takes some time to reflect back.

770
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,171
Let me get this straight.

771
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:59,106
You're trying to tell me
that on the other side of this bridge

772
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,271
- is the actual past?
- Yes.

773
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,777
- Wow.
- DENNY: Yeah. But look, look, look.

774
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,006
We created this thing by pure accident.
All right?

775
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:09,643
This space and time...
This time window is a complete fluke.

776
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:13,752
All right? And everybody is terrified
of screwing with it for fear of losing it

777
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,984
or suffering the consequences
of God knows what,

778
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,083
which is why it can only be used
as a retroactive tool...

779
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:20,321
Hey, let me ask you something.
Is she alive or is she dead?

780
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,988
- You went to her funeral, Doug.
- I know that,

781
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:25,090
but I think the question still applies.
Is she alive or is she dead?

782
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:28,898
All right. Life, like time and space,
is not merely a local phenomenon.

783
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,370
All right!

784
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,540
Am I asking a hard question?

785
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:36,111
(CLEARS THROAT) Looks like I picked
a bad week to stop snorting hash.

786
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,406
All right, I tell you what.

787
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:42,042
I'll speak slow, so those of you with
Ph.D.'s in the room can understand.

788
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,380
It... Here. Look. Here's a monitor, right?

789
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,416
Now the monitor is broken. It's dead.

790
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:54,327
It is not temporarily transitioned
to another state of entropy.

791
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:59,596
It's dead, right?
Now, is she alive or is she dead?

792
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,168
- She's alive.
- All right.

793
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,238
Now we're getting somewhere.

794
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,307
All right, now, you said
light could go back. What else?

795
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,965
- Nothing.
- Something else could be sent back.

796
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,067
Come on, Paul. Something.
What? A body? A human being?

797
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:10,271
- No.
- Not a person. Not alive, anyway.

798
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,405
- Why not?
- Because you can't beat the physics.

799
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,006
The electromagnetic field.
Look, you transition across

800
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,949
what's known as
the Wheeler Boundary, all right?

801
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,248
An EM pulse annihilates
all electrical activity.

802
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,290
That's your heartbeat,
that's brainwaves, that's everything.

803
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,256
So what? You haven't tried a person?

804
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,622
Let's just say
that we've done enough tests

805
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,662
to know that it's not even possible.

806
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,323
It's not even theoretically possible.
The hamster goes back, dead.

807
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,627
- A drosophila fly, dead.
- What about a radio signal?

808
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:32,963
What about that?
We could send a radio...

809
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,229
- A radio signal?
- Yeah, a radio signal.

810
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,168
- Won't work. Electrical.
- The field would scramble it.

811
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,638
- All right, then a note, a warning note.
- No.

812
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,437
- A single piece of paper. One sheet.
- No.

813
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:41,976
- Lf we keep the mass low...
- No!

814
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,170
This could work! It could work.

815
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,507
Sure. We know
where the guy's gonna be.

816
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,104
We can apprehend him
and put him away

817
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,205
before he even blows up the boat.

818
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,649
- And how do we do that, exactly?
- We send it to ourselves!

819
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,278
You send it to me. Yeah, send it to me.
Send it to my office.

820
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,323
Send it to my office
four and a half days ago,

821
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:57,552
an anonymous tip, and we can capture
this guy before he even meets Claire.

822
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,457
We know he's gonna be at the dock.

823
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:00,688
Whatever you did, you did it already.

824
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,595
Whether you send this note or you
don't send this note, it doesn't matter.

825
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,635
You cannot change the past.
It's physically impossible.

826
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,195
What if there's more than physics?

827
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,471
Okay. Something spiritual, right?

828
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,374
- Yeah, something spiritual.
- Okay, okay, okay. Look.

829
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,912
Just try to think of it this way.

830
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,039
God's mind is made up about this.
All right?

831
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,778
I mean, you know,
call it fate, call it destiny, whatever.

832
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,218
But it already happened,
it will keep happening,

833
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,721
- and it always will happen.
- Maybe.

834
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,088
And why don't we call it fate,
since we're calling it something?

835
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,787
Maybe you're right. Maybe you guys
are exactly right. I don't know.

836
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,126
All I know is this. For all of my career,

837
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:38,325
I've been trying to catch people
after they do something horrible.

838
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:39,459
For once in my life,

839
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,129
I'd like to catch somebody
before they do something horrible.

840
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,103
All right? Can you understand that?

841
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,480
Address is in range.

842
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,037
Address is in range.

843
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,112
Two L's. "Surveilling," two L's.

844
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,149
Since this is such a tremendous waste
of taxpayer money,

845
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:03,816
the least we could do
is get the spelling right.

846
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:04,916
That's not necessarily true.

847
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,723
Branching universe theory holds
that you can do...

848
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,060
- Oh, branching universe theory.
- SHANTl: Look, hold it. All right.

849
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,099
- No, no, no.
- I'll show you.

850
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,364
The traditional view of time is linear,

851
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,439
like a river flowing from the past
toward the future.

852
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,530
But you can change
the course of a river, right?

853
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:22,475
Exactly. Introduce a significant enough
event at any point in this river

854
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,308
and you create a new branch,

855
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,850
still flowing toward the future,
but along a different route.

856
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,043
Changed.

857
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,279
Yeah, but that river is the Mississippi,

858
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,378
and we're lobbing
what amounts to a pebble into it.

859
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,857
That's a very few tiny ripples in a kind
of big body of water, don't you think?

860
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,393
Traditionalist.

861
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,122
Say we do create this new branch.

862
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,425
What happens to the old one?
To this one?

863
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,090
Ask the radical.

864
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,333
Well, it might continue
parallel to the new branch,

865
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:50,830
but most likely it ceases to exist.

866
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,431
The idea is, we cease to exist.

867
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,204
All right? This version of us, anyway.

868
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,075
You know, we never came here.
We didn't meet Doug.

869
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,673
We don't remember it ever happening.

870
00:57:01,784 --> 00:57:04,116
Well, that's worth $ 10 billion
right there.

871
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,788
Would've been a lot faster
if you'd written it yourself.

872
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,760
Right. Then I recognize
my own handwriting

873
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,854
and the universe blows up.

874
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,805
We're ready.

875
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:36,283
All right, third floor, southwest corner.
That's where we are.

876
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,444
MINUTl: How'd you
get that information?

877
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,580
CARLIN: Good police work.

878
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,679
That's me. I can hear me.

879
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,281
- I don't wanna play games with you.
- Where am I?

880
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,655
- I'm not playing games.
- Yeah, you are.

881
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:46,456
- No, I'm not.
- There are protocols... Yeah, you are.

882
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,861
- There I am.
- Is that Minuti?

883
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,830
- There's procedures...
- Yep. That's my partner, Larry.

884
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:53,061
Look, I know how this job works,
you know how this job works.

885
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:55,034
Jesus, I forgot all about this part.

886
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,073
All right, let's find a nice, happy place
to push the note onto.

887
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,039
- That your desk?
- Yeah, that's my...

888
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,735
Okay. Line us up.

889
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:05,606
When I peg a guy on a hunch,
that's good police work,

890
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,707
not some conspiracy
to keep you out of the loop, all right?

891
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,048
- You know what, Doug?
- Okay, kid, start pushing.

892
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,416
Expand the wave past the note.

893
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,285
I can't watch your back
if you're holding out on me.

894
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,379
Why not?

895
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:17,516
If my memory serves me right,
we better hurry up,

896
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,151
'cause I think I'm about to leave.

897
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,957
- I need more cowbell.
- GUNNARS: I'm trying.

898
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,395
- Okay, well, I...
- Good!

899
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:23,465
Just give me a second.

900
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,727
- Don't talk to each other.
- DENNY: Expand.

901
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:26,824
I'm about to leave.

902
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:28,563
...another partner?
How about that? How about that?

903
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,263
- Everybody relax.
- Okay. Yeah.

904
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:31,567
- Let's go.
- I'm working on it.

905
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,335
Prepare for the final power surge.
Ready?

906
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,708
- Have a good vacation.
- All right. Go, go, go!

907
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,814
Walk away.

908
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,317
PRYZWARRA:
What the hell happened?

909
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:52,416
DENNY: I don't know.

910
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:54,325
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Pull it back!

911
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,057
- Did it go through?
- I don't know! I don't know!

912
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,166
Pull it back.

913
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,236
- There it is.
- It went through.

914
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,776
- That's right.
- It's through.

915
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,072
PRYZWARRA: It went through!
SHANTl: Great.

916
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,806
Whoa, whoa.
No, wait a minute. Hang on.

917
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:13,939
It ain't great yet. I don't come back.

918
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:31,695
Put it down, Larry. I'm not coming back.

919
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,604
Put it down, Larry.

920
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:44,574
Larry, don't do it.

921
00:59:45,948 --> 00:59:47,609
- Follow him.
- I'm on him.

922
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:11,262
All right, look, let's... You know what?
Let's cut away from Minuti.

923
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,808
The bomber's on his way to the dock.
He's due there any minute.

924
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,004
We'll come back to Minuti
when he gets there, all right?

925
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:22,015
All right.

926
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,446
Okay, where is he?

927
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:30,222
Can we circle it?

928
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,855
We should be able to see him by now.

929
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,405
That's him. There he is. All right.

930
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:47,999
- Holy shit.
- CARLIN: All right.

931
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,545
Move in on him real close.
I want to see his... That's him.

932
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:51,977
That's him.

933
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:56,514
That's our guy. That's him.
At the bridge, the cemetery, the ATM.

934
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:57,643
That's our guy.

935
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,813
Shanti, see if you can get
an ID, facial ID on him.

936
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,857
- Give me some time.
- Okay. All right. Take your time.

937
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,621
- There's your partner.
- I see him.

938
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,198
CARLIN: Try to move in on his truck.

939
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:11,994
See if we can get a plate.

940
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,960
- No plate.
- Get back on him.

941
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:20,675
Stay on him.

942
01:01:25,414 --> 01:01:26,847
Where's Minuti?

943
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:29,247
Federal agent! Turn the engine off!

944
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,786
Turn the engine off!

945
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,057
(CRYING)

946
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,266
Tilt back down.

947
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,070
GUNNARS: He's still breathing.

948
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:11,718
- What can we do?
- I don't know what to do.

949
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,828
He's traveling east.
He's traveling out of range.

950
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,597
- Okay, what can we do? Anything?
- I don't know,

951
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,432
but if we don't do something fast,
I'm gonna lose this guy.

952
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,199
SHANTl: We're losing the signal.

953
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,433
We have to boost the signal.

954
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,771
We need to chase him
with the goggle rig.

955
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,538
Yeah, well,
Gunnars is a little busy right now,

956
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:30,475
and he's the only one who can use it.

957
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,318
- Where is it?
- What, the rig? It's...

958
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:38,295
- Yeah, the rig. Where is it?
- It's in his Hummer.

959
01:02:41,954 --> 01:02:43,819
- Keys in there?
- Yeah.

960
01:03:08,915 --> 01:03:09,904
(PHONE RINGING)

961
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:12,075
All right, quiet, everybody. It's him.

962
01:03:12,785 --> 01:03:14,878
- Carlin.
- Where's he now?

963
01:03:15,054 --> 01:03:19,320
- Is he going east?
- Yes.

964
01:03:19,425 --> 01:03:20,983
Okay, he's going east,
going up on De Gaulle.

965
01:03:22,822 --> 01:03:25,313
All right, just try to keep him in sight,
and keep feeding me directions.

966
01:03:25,424 --> 01:03:28,188
I'll try and track him with this goggle rig.

967
01:03:28,294 --> 01:03:30,489
- Can he do that?
- Yeah, if he can catch up to the image

968
01:03:30,596 --> 01:03:33,087
and keep him in sight, that could work.

969
01:03:36,169 --> 01:03:37,864
Hey, how do you turn this thing on?

970
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:40,905
There's an on-off button
on the back of the rig.

971
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:41,974
Okay, I see it.

972
01:03:42,074 --> 01:03:44,838
It's really simple. Wherever you look,
the eyepiece will auto-focus,

973
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:47,003
and we'll see what you see.

974
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,516
Okay, you're live. You're on.

975
01:03:52,618 --> 01:03:55,143
- PRYZWARRA: Try the goggles.
- Hang on, hang on.

976
01:03:59,025 --> 01:04:01,585
- He's gone. Out of range.
- What?

977
01:04:01,694 --> 01:04:04,356
- Where's he headed?
- SHAN Tl: He's headed toward the l- 10.

978
01:04:04,463 --> 01:04:06,055
East or west?

979
01:04:06,499 --> 01:04:08,763
GUNNARS: I don't know.
SHANTl: I don't know.

980
01:04:08,901 --> 01:04:10,368
East or west?

981
01:04:10,469 --> 01:04:12,266
We lost the signal. We're blind in here.

982
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:14,931
- SHAN Tl: I don't know.
- All right, hang on.

983
01:04:17,677 --> 01:04:19,269
Oh, shit!

984
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:23,843
What? What happened?
What happened?

985
01:04:29,455 --> 01:04:30,979
This is trippy.

986
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:32,216
Doug, look straight ahead.

987
01:04:32,325 --> 01:04:33,792
We've got the window slaved
to your goggles.

988
01:04:33,893 --> 01:04:36,919
We are seeing what you're seeing
four days in the past.

989
01:04:38,431 --> 01:04:40,331
Okay, I got him. I got him.
He's back in range.

990
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:41,900
He's going west, not east,

991
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:43,935
on the Crescent City Bridge.

992
01:04:46,706 --> 01:04:49,038
There he is. That's him. Opposite lane.

993
01:04:50,142 --> 01:04:51,734
- CARLIN: I got him.
- That's him. That's him.

994
01:04:51,844 --> 01:04:53,243
I got him!

995
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,277
Watch the traffic.

996
01:05:05,524 --> 01:05:07,355
- What was that?
- I think he hit something.

997
01:05:10,796 --> 01:05:14,232
SHANTl: Doug, you've gotta stay
with him. You're gonna lose him again.

998
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,292
Doug, what's happening?

999
01:05:21,374 --> 01:05:23,137
I got him! I got him.

1000
01:05:24,677 --> 01:05:25,974
All right, all right, all right.

1001
01:05:26,078 --> 01:05:28,012
Good. Now stay with him.

1002
01:05:28,414 --> 01:05:31,247
Send paramedics
to the Crescent City Bridge.

1003
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,783
DENNY: Got that?

1004
01:05:35,421 --> 01:05:36,854
I lost him.

1005
01:05:42,862 --> 01:05:44,420
(HORNS HONKING)

1006
01:05:46,198 --> 01:05:48,462
- I got him! I got him!
- DENNY: All right. All right.

1007
01:05:48,567 --> 01:05:49,795
SHANTl: That's him.

1008
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:52,132
He's headed for the 10 to the bayou.

1009
01:06:12,124 --> 01:06:14,888
I can see him. He's right in front of me.

1010
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:25,064
Carlin!

1011
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:27,198
What was that?
What the hell was that?

1012
01:06:27,306 --> 01:06:28,967
Doug, are you all right?

1013
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:33,639
DENN Y: Doug!

1014
01:06:34,447 --> 01:06:35,539
Doug?

1015
01:06:37,316 --> 01:06:39,682
I think it's broken. I can't see anything.

1016
01:06:39,785 --> 01:06:42,777
We still have a signal here.
You're still transmitting.

1017
01:06:43,122 --> 01:06:45,590
- You can see?
- We'll talk you through it.

1018
01:06:45,691 --> 01:06:47,716
Can you still drive?

1019
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:49,226
Yeah, yeah. Where is he?

1020
01:06:49,328 --> 01:06:51,728
Give us a 360 with the goggle rig.

1021
01:06:52,865 --> 01:06:55,459
DENNY: There! There he is!
Pan the thing around.

1022
01:06:55,568 --> 01:06:57,365
- Which way?
- To your right.

1023
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:58,937
To your right.

1024
01:07:00,206 --> 01:07:01,969
There! There he is!

1025
01:07:02,074 --> 01:07:04,838
- He's taking the road to the bayou!
- Right there?

1026
01:07:05,378 --> 01:07:06,675
The road is blocked.

1027
01:07:06,779 --> 01:07:08,542
Take the expressway.
It parallels the road.

1028
01:07:08,647 --> 01:07:10,080
Go. Go, go!

1029
01:07:23,763 --> 01:07:24,752
See him?

1030
01:07:24,864 --> 01:07:26,422
Pan right. Pan right!

1031
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,994
CARLIN: You still see him?

1032
01:07:29,301 --> 01:07:30,791
He's at the end of the bridge.

1033
01:07:30,903 --> 01:07:33,463
- DENNY: You hear me?
- He's at the end of the bridge.

1034
01:07:38,244 --> 01:07:39,506
Keep talking to me.

1035
01:07:39,612 --> 01:07:43,639
I don't know what else to tell you.
I feel very, very close to you right now.

1036
01:07:43,749 --> 01:07:45,944
He took the exit ramp beneath you.

1037
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:48,986
- Take the next off-ramp.
- DENNY: Take the next off-ramp!

1038
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:53,584
All right, I'm on the off-ramp.

1039
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,989
Go right, then double back on yourself.

1040
01:07:56,095 --> 01:07:57,824
All right, I got it.

1041
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:02,396
All right, take another right.

1042
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,535
Still see him?

1043
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:12,800
He's heading to the bayou.
Take a left here.

1044
01:08:18,284 --> 01:08:19,512
Good, good, good.

1045
01:08:19,618 --> 01:08:21,017
PRYZWARRA: Take it easy, Doug.
He's dead ahead of you.

1046
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:23,763
Okay, okay, okay.

1047
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:33,539
He's slowing down, coming to a fence.
Do you see it?

1048
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:38,235
Yeah, I see it.

1049
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,021
GUNNARS: Doug, if you're gonna
leave the Hummer, take the backpack.

1050
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,365
It's the power source for the rig.

1051
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:57,229
It's the power source for the rig.

1052
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,723
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1053
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,888
Yeah, we can hear you.
We can hear you.

1054
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:30,189
All right.

1055
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:42,076
What's he doing now?

1056
01:09:47,043 --> 01:09:48,874
He's pulled around
the back of the building.

1057
01:09:51,448 --> 01:09:53,541
Looks like a bomb went off.

1058
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:57,313
Really?
We see an intact structure here.

1059
01:09:58,154 --> 01:10:01,248
- No damage?
- No, none.

1060
01:10:03,026 --> 01:10:05,290
Looks like a vehicle's inside.

1061
01:10:05,395 --> 01:10:07,295
An ambulance. You see that?

1062
01:10:08,298 --> 01:10:10,323
No. Nothing.

1063
01:10:33,957 --> 01:10:35,390
See anything?

1064
01:10:36,126 --> 01:10:38,185
PRYZWARRA: He's dead ahead of you.

1065
01:10:38,294 --> 01:10:40,194
Doug, he's pulling Minuti out of the car.

1066
01:10:40,296 --> 01:10:41,388
Where?

1067
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:43,523
All right, now pan to the right.
Pan to the right.

1068
01:10:43,633 --> 01:10:44,861
- More right.
- DENNY: You got him.

1069
01:10:44,968 --> 01:10:46,492
Yeah, he's dragging him out of the car.

1070
01:10:46,603 --> 01:10:47,900
Do you see him?

1071
01:10:48,004 --> 01:10:50,268
- Yeah.
- Yes. Right in front of you.

1072
01:10:50,373 --> 01:10:52,170
Boost the audio for me.

1073
01:10:52,275 --> 01:10:53,833
Audio boosted.

1074
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:56,778
DENN Y: Turn around.
Turn around behind you.

1075
01:10:57,681 --> 01:10:59,581
- Larry?
- Pan back to the right.

1076
01:11:00,183 --> 01:11:01,548
- You've got him now.
- Where is he?

1077
01:11:01,651 --> 01:11:03,744
He's being dragged on the concrete.

1078
01:11:06,356 --> 01:11:07,687
Larry!

1079
01:11:12,328 --> 01:11:13,955
What's that sound?

1080
01:11:14,831 --> 01:11:16,458
What's the sound?

1081
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:21,263
He's pouring some kind of accelerant
over Agent Minuti.

1082
01:11:21,371 --> 01:11:24,704
I think it's the diesel fuel,
like at the ferry.

1083
01:11:33,717 --> 01:11:35,344
He's waking up.

1084
01:11:35,452 --> 01:11:38,683
Brace yourselves. I think
you're about to witness a murder.

1085

(GUN FIRES)

1086
01:12:44,087 --> 01:12:45,748
(CHA TTERIN G ON RADIO)

1087
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:54,053
If we hadn't sent him there,
he wouldn't be dead now.

1088
01:12:54,164 --> 01:12:56,928
No, he was already dead from the ferry.
We just changed how he died.

1089
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:58,125
We don't know that.

1090
01:12:58,234 --> 01:12:59,599
He could've been standing
right next to you,

1091
01:12:59,702 --> 01:13:00,726
right until we sent that note.

1092
01:13:00,837 --> 01:13:03,101
SHAN Tl: You'd need a branching
multiple universe for that to happen.

1093
01:13:03,206 --> 01:13:05,970
DENN Y: Oh, come on.
We can't change anything.

1094
01:13:06,075 --> 01:13:09,408
We didn't change anything.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

1095
01:13:09,512 --> 01:13:11,503
I'll tell you what we did.

1096
01:13:12,115 --> 01:13:15,414
The suspect used a stolen Blazer
to case the dock.

1097
01:13:15,518 --> 01:13:19,477
So now he has a truck big enough
to drive a bomb onto the ferry.

1098
01:13:20,089 --> 01:13:22,080
Now Larry shows up, right?

1099
01:13:22,692 --> 01:13:25,525
Larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield.

1100
01:13:25,628 --> 01:13:28,188
- You want a mask?
- No. No, I'm good, thanks.

1101
01:13:28,298 --> 01:13:30,323
Larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield,

1102
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:33,766
leaves blood all over the back seat,
so now our bomber needs a new truck,

1103
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:36,270
you understand? Claire's truck.

01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:39,539
You hungry?

1105
01:13:39,642 --> 01:13:40,734
Yeah, we changed one thing,

1106
01:13:40,844 --> 01:13:43,574
but by changing one thing,
we didn't change anything.

1107
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,375
What's on TV?

1108
01:14:22,418 --> 01:14:23,544
Hey, hey, hey, we got a name.

- Is this a he or a she?
- It's a he. Let's go.

1115
01:15:12,969 --> 01:15:14,163

interview with Carroll Oerstadt.

1120
01:15:53,986 --> 01:15:55,681
You've waived your right
to counsel, right?

1121
01:15:55,787 --> 01:15:57,550
- OERS TAD T: Yes, sir.
- Okay.

1122
01:15:58,857 --> 01:16:02,122
I'm fascinated with your precision.

1123
01:16:03,061 --> 01:16:05,859
It's not very often we see that level
of expertise around here,

1124
01:16:05,964 --> 01:16:08,364
and if it's all right with you,
I'd like to use this interview

1125
01:16:08,467 --> 01:16:12,198
to educate my colleagues
in law enforcement.

1126
01:16:12,304 --> 01:16:14,898
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Good.

1127
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,402
Let's talk about motive.

1128
01:16:16,508 --> 01:16:20,103
Why would you use explosives
against the US Navy?

1129
01:16:21,547 --> 01:16:25,847
- Correction, sir. US Government.
- US Government.

1130
01:16:26,685 --> 01:16:29,984
It says here that you tried
to enlist in the Marines.

1131
01:16:30,088 --> 01:16:31,919
You were rejected.
You tried to enlist in the Army,

1132
01:16:32,024 --> 01:16:34,049
you were rejected again.

1133
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,423
Why do you think they did that?

1134
01:16:37,963 --> 01:16:40,329
Because they don't want patriots.

1135
01:16:41,033 --> 01:16:44,127
The military no longer recognizes
commitment and purpose.

1136
01:16:44,636 --> 01:16:48,094
They thought I was overcommitted
and psychologically unstable.

1137
01:16:48,207 --> 01:16:49,970
They didn't want to understand
my value.

1138
01:16:51,794 --> 01:16:53,523
They understand it now.

1139
01:16:54,163 --> 01:16:56,097
I believe so. Yes, sir.

1140
01:16:59,768 --> 01:17:02,168
- You're ATF, right?
- Yes, I am.

1141
01:17:03,038 --> 01:17:05,506
- Got a smoke?
- No, I don't. But I can get you one.

1142
01:17:05,608 --> 01:17:07,075
- Would you like one?
- Yes.

1143
01:17:07,176 --> 01:17:09,974
Okay. Anything you want to say,
just talk into the mike.

1144
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:13,276
A man can always use more alcohol,
tobacco and firearms.

1145
01:17:13,382 --> 01:17:15,407
I can think of one more thing.

1146
01:17:19,188 --> 01:17:21,247
It's like the Revolutionary War,
you know what I mean?

1147
01:17:21,357 --> 01:17:24,485
"One man's terrorist
is another man's patriot, " isn't it?

1148
01:17:25,227 --> 01:17:27,252
CARLIN: Yeah?
OERS TAD T: Exactly.

1149
01:17:27,363 --> 01:17:28,955
- Yeah.
- You get it.

1150
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,092
- This wasn't about revenge.
- What was it about?

1151
01:17:37,172 --> 01:17:38,366
Destiny.

1152
01:17:38,707 --> 01:17:39,901
Destiny?

1153
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:42,802
You've been asking me
about my motives.

1154
01:17:42,911 --> 01:17:44,435
- Right. Right.
- My methods.

1155
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:47,539
They're all connected.

1156
01:17:48,217 --> 01:17:49,650
Everything's connected.

1157
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:52,050
Okay.
How was Claire Kuchever connected?

1158
01:17:52,154 --> 01:17:53,621
I needed a car.

1159
01:17:53,722 --> 01:17:55,280
- And that's it?
- No, well, something

1160
01:17:55,391 --> 01:17:57,359
- that couldn't be traced back to me.
- Right.

1161
01:17:57,459 --> 01:18:00,223
I had one ready till that cop showed up.

1162
01:18:00,863 --> 01:18:03,491
That cop was a federal agent.

1163
01:18:03,599 --> 01:18:05,965
Lawrence Minuti. My partner.
You shot him.

1164
01:18:06,068 --> 01:18:09,037
He... I was about to burn him
and he was waking up, you know?

1165
01:18:09,138 --> 01:18:10,730
I mean, I'm not cruel.

1166
01:18:13,242 --> 01:18:17,379
Well, why didn't you "do that"
for Claire Kuchever?

1167
01:18:19,081 --> 01:18:24,542
Well, because I needed her
to look like a ferry victim,

1168
01:18:24,653 --> 01:18:25,854
- and a bullet would've given it away.
- I see.

1169
01:18:25,854 --> 01:18:27,014
- And a bullet would've given it away.
- I see.

1170
01:18:27,122 --> 01:18:30,455
I went to her house
on the pretense of buying her car.

1171
01:18:30,559 --> 01:18:33,790
I took her from behind, taped her mouth
and threw a hood over her head.

1172
01:18:33,896 --> 01:18:34,863
Then?

1173
01:18:34,963 --> 01:18:37,989
I bound her wrists and her ankles
and I drove her back to my place.

1174
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,931
I loaded the device into her car

1175
01:18:40,035 --> 01:18:41,593
and then I soaked her
with the gasoline.

1176
01:18:41,704 --> 01:18:42,796
Jesus.

1177
01:18:42,905 --> 01:18:43,929
And?

1178
01:18:44,173 --> 01:18:45,572
I think you know
what happened after that.

1179
01:18:45,674 --> 01:18:47,574
No, I don't know. I want you to tell me.
You gotta talk.

1180
01:18:47,676 --> 01:18:49,701
I mean, you know, come on, hero.
What happened after that?

1181
01:18:49,812 --> 01:18:50,972
I'll tell you what happened after that.

1182
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,516
You killed 543 people.
How do you feel about that?

1183
01:18:59,655 --> 01:19:03,284
I think that you were a murderer
right from the beginning.

1184
01:19:05,794 --> 01:19:09,355
Sometimes a little human collateral
is the cost of freedom.

1185
01:19:09,465 --> 01:19:11,330
To me,
those people were war casualties,

1186
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:13,333
but to you, they're just evidence.

1187
01:19:13,435 --> 01:19:15,869
That'll do. We got him.

1188
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:16,938
CARLIN: What'd you say?

1189
01:19:17,172 --> 01:19:20,903
You think you know what's coming?
You don't have a clue.

1190
01:19:21,009 --> 01:19:23,000
I know where you're going.

1191
01:19:23,412 --> 01:19:27,075
I know you're gonna be away
for a long time. I know that.

1192
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:30,574
- This case will never even go to trial.
- No?

1193
01:19:32,121 --> 01:19:35,147
- 'Cause I seen what's coming.
- Did... Have you? What?

1194
01:19:35,924 --> 01:19:39,087
What is in this glass?
You've seen what's coming, huh?

1195
01:19:39,194 --> 01:19:41,287
Okay, what's coming? You tell me.

1196
01:19:42,264 --> 01:19:44,926
I told you earlier I have a destiny,

1197
01:19:45,033 --> 01:19:46,364
a purpose.

1198
01:19:47,069 --> 01:19:50,163
Satan reasons like man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1199
01:19:50,739 --> 01:19:55,267
Well, I prostrate myself before a world
that's going to hell in a handbag,

1200
01:19:55,377 --> 01:19:58,471
'cause in all eternity,
I am here and I will be remembered.

1201
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:00,172
That's destiny.

1202
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:02,646
A bomb has a destiny,

1203
01:20:03,185 --> 01:20:06,245
a predetermined fate
set by the hand of its creator.

1204
01:20:06,355 --> 01:20:09,654
And anyone who tries to alter
that destiny will be destroyed.

1205
01:20:09,758 --> 01:20:13,125
Anyone who tries to stop it
from happening will cause it to happen.

1206
01:20:13,228 --> 01:20:15,128
And that's what you don't understand.

1207
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:19,064
We're not here to coexist.
I'm here to win.

1208
01:20:19,435 --> 01:20:22,268
So you'd better have
some divine intervention, buddy.

1209
01:20:23,071 --> 01:20:25,198
You're gonna need it.

1210
01:20:25,507 --> 01:20:29,034
You'd better have some K-Y.
You're gonna need it.

1211
01:20:40,956 --> 01:20:42,981
What am I supposed to do?

1212
01:20:44,359 --> 01:20:46,759
- We're shutting you down.
- What?

1213
01:20:47,262 --> 01:20:48,251
Yeah, we got what we need.

1214
01:20:48,363 --> 01:20:50,831
The forensics, the suspect,
a confession. We're done.

1215
01:20:50,933 --> 01:20:54,425
Sir, perhaps we should continue
and watch the actual crime.

1216
01:20:54,536 --> 01:20:56,060
- The ferry bombing.
- Right. He's right.

1217
01:20:56,171 --> 01:20:58,298
I mean, we can't just
go on the confession alone.

1218
01:20:58,407 --> 01:21:00,637
We need an airtight case.
We need to collect more evidence.

1219
01:21:00,742 --> 01:21:03,006
Well, collecting evidence
would've been fine, Agent Carly.

1220
01:21:03,111 --> 01:21:05,671
- You took it a little further than that.
- Agent Carlin. Carlin.

1221
01:21:05,781 --> 01:21:06,873
My name is Carlin, not Carly.

1222
01:21:06,982 --> 01:21:09,542
We had protocols in place.
There's strict protocols.

1223
01:21:09,651 --> 01:21:12,347
And then you had to push it,
and now an agent's dead.

1224
01:21:12,454 --> 01:21:14,718
Sir, by one theory,
that already happened.

1225
01:21:14,823 --> 01:21:18,088
We're done. Power it down.
Pack it up. On to the next case.

1226
01:21:18,827 --> 01:21:20,590
- What about Claire?
- What...

1227
01:21:21,163 --> 01:21:23,154
Lookit, charging Oerstadt
in the Kuchever murder

1228
01:21:23,265 --> 01:21:25,859
is gonna raise too many questions
about how we obtained the evidence.

1229
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:27,367
I understand that, sir,
but what about Claire?

1230
01:21:27,469 --> 01:21:28,527
Are we just gonna drop the case?

1231
01:21:28,637 --> 01:21:31,071
We got him on the ferry bombing,

- No, I'm sure. You go ahead.

one of your boyfriend's jackets, though.

- What?

Why don't you put on a different one?

1400
