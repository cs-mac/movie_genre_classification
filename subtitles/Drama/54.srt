2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,874
It was the late seventies,

3
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,501
and everybody was in the middle of it.

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,158
The recession, the mile-Iong lines
to the station.

5
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:31,139
The hostage crisis in Iran.

6
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:33,606
When I look back at it now,

7
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:35,531
it is amazing I can remeber any of it.

8
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:38,436
It feels like snap-shots from
someone else's life,

9
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:40,068
all connected by one man...

10
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:47,364
A guy named Steve Rubell,

11
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:48,714
...had a dream...

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,270
to throw the best damn party
the world had ever seen.

13
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:53,604
And to make it last forever.

14
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:56,515
He built a world that was offered up
as reality,

15
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,789
where an eighty year old Disco Queen
could play until dawn,

16
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:02,309
where models mingled with mechanics,

17
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,106
...plumbers danced with princes.

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,561
It was a place where all labels
were left behind.

19
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,439
A place where there were no rules.

20
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,271
In 1979 I was nineteen years old

21
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:29,322
and I had nothing.

22
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:31,688
Now my Dad would say I had more
than he did at my age,

23
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:32,655
but you know what?

24
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:33,735
To me,

25
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:36,077
filling gas tanks at a
Jersey City station...

26
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:38,981
going to the same dingy bar,
with the same guys

27
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:40,683
trying to pick-up on the same chicks,

28
00:01:40,753 --> 00:01:41,996
...was not tons of fun.

29
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,591
I can't believe you came already!

30
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,518
Sorry.

31
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:57,479
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,853
It was just an...

33
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,678
Look at you! You're so...

34
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:04,049
Oh yeah...you want to go out tomorrow?

35
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,831
Look, I know this place where the
pizza is dynamite.

36
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:09,006
What?

37
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:11,017
I'm from Montana, right?

38
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:12,749
And you are from Jersey City?

39
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,062
Yeah.

40
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:17,521
So...I don't go out with guys
from Jersey City.

41
00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:24,332
I knew the real escape was right across
the river...

42
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,673
But I didn't even have a car.

43
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,713
Even though New York was
three miles away,

44
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:30,380
...it seemed like another world.

45
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,650
I had been there before with my Mom.

46
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,733
She did makeup for this television show,

47
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:37,106
...and took me to work a few times.

48
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:38,675
It was incredible.

49
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,715
Everyone wanted to be around the stars.

50
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:44,137
My mother always told me I could be
anything I wanted to be,

51
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:45,674
and I believed her.

52
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,428
Mom died when I was twelve.

53
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,914
This was dad...

54
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:54,578
...his idea of the good life was,

55
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:57,460
a can of "Schlitz" and a
"Jack Benny Special" on the tube.

56
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:00,398
I had to break out.

57
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:02,642
I knew I had to make a change.

58
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:08,301
Alright, alright, alright.

59
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:13,141
What!

60
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,384
What you laughing at?

61
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:15,218
What is with the hair?

62
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:16,115
Look at this guy!

63
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:16,946
Where is my hair?

64
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:18,388
Look at this guy!

65
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,559
What are you talking about?

66
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:22,191
You look like Vidal Sassoon.

67
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,877
If YOU don't look good,
we don't look good!

68
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:44,082
Shit, I should have borrowed
my brother's platforms.

69
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:47,023
Do I look short?

70
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:53,108
Hey you guys, you guys...

71
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,248
Before we go in. Check it out.

72
00:03:57,817 --> 00:03:59,191
Oh take me home baby!

73
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:01,013
That is Julie Black from
"All of my Children".

74
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,194
She is my fucking dream girl.

75
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,793
Julie Black, she is from Alpine.

76
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:04,848
My aunt does her ma's hair.

77
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,035
Saw her once too,

78
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,021
...hanging out at the Alpine Inn.

79
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:07,665
Alpine Inn?

80
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,785
Yeah.

81
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:10,036
We should stake her out.

82
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:12,688
Where was this taken anyway?

83
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,598
You know Studio 54.

84
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:17,844
Have you never heard of it?

85
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:19,376
That place is full of freaks...

86
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,378
And girls...

87
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:21,303
And fags...

88
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:22,647
Come on you guys.

89
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:23,859
Listen, you know who was there
last night?

90
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:25,562
Jacqueline Bissette.

91
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:27,666
You know who she is?

92
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:29,080
Yeah I fucked her.

93
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:32,433
Alright, you turkeys can stay here,

94
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:33,554
and rot for all I care.

95
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:35,863
But I'm going to go see if I can
get a look at Olivia.

96
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,298
Olivia Newton-John?

97
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:40,722
We aren't there yet?

98
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:43,611
Fuck you Jersey!

99
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,027
We will save you a place in line!

100
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,688
You mothers!

101
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,480
You are going to leave me
with these freaks!

102
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,164
Hey! Hey!

103
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,868
A lot of people thought the door was
a better show than inside.

104
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,336
People would try anything to get in.

105
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:22,807
Mark was the doorman,

106
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:24,568
but it was Steve Rubell's club,

107
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:25,565
and his door.

108
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,873
I can't let you in here.

109
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,285
You are wearing an ascot.

110
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,726
You look like an asshole.

111
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:33,431
He was out in front, every night,
making sure only the right people got in.

112
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,555
Go home.

113
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,419
No. No...

114
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,560
Hey come on!

115
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,112
Over there. Yeah.

116
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,141
Excuse me! He just pointed at me!

117
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,174
Just you.

118
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,459
Say what?

119
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:51,771
Just you, not him.

120
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,815
Hey man, these are my friends,

121
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:54,238
you can't...

122
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:59,487
Girls...Stand back, please.

123
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:01,822
Oh my God...

124
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,223
Don't be a spaz man, go for it.

125
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:05,150
Alright, don't wait for me.

126
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:06,165
I will find my own way home.

127
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,419
Okay you guys, come on.

128
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:15,873
Get your fucking hands off me,
you jive-ass turkey!

129
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,743
Sorry guy...

130
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:22,114
What?

131
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:23,423
Not with that shirt.

132
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:27,100
Hey!

133
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,593
I said...not with that shirt.

134
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,712
Welcome to my party, handsome!

135
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,235
He choose me.

136
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,307
I had never been chosen for
anything before.

137
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,106
You want to check that body, sugar?

138
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:08,644
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all?

139
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,978
Truman? Truman Capote, Where are you?

140
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,091
Here sugar!

141
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,651
There you are.

142
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:18,823
In honor of your fantastic new
face lift...

143
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,414
I thought I would get you
a couple of things.

144
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,467
And to make sure, the lift sticks.

145
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:45,772
I thought we should all...
"Knock on Wood".

146
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,703
Oh Yeah!

147
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:13,097
I don't want to lose, this good thing
...that I have got.

148
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:19,759
Because if I do...I would surely...
surely lose a lot...

149
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:26,437
Because your love...is better...
than anything I know!

150
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:32,940
It's like thunder! Lightning!
The way you love me is frightening.

151
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:50,894
knock...on wood! I said I better knock, 
knock on...oh baby...yes.

152
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:56,783
Like thunder! Lightning!

153
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,154
The way you love me is frightening!

154
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:19,920
Knock, knock on wood! Yeah baby! I better knock on wood.

155
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,534
The thing about stars is, they are short.

156
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:28,853
Did you talk to any of them?

157
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,419
Kind of...

158
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:30,355
Who?

159
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:32,142
Well, like...I don't know...

160
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:34,036
But you should have seen
the photographers.

161
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,655
I will bet you I even got in
one of their pictures.

162
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:38,122
Do you think Farrah ever goes there?

163
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:38,994
Maybe.

164
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,923
And Lee Majors?

165
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,037
Probably.

166
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,453
What about Princess Grace?

167
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,887
Sure, I bet she goes all the time.

168
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,234
Really?

169
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,644
Maybe we can touch her when she goes by.

170
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:48,149
I told her mom named us after her.

171
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:48,878
Hey kids.

172
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,746
Hey dad.

173
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:52,781
Hey squirt.

174
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:55,124
Hey dad, can I borrow the keys tonight?

175
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,052
What for?

176
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,232
Shane was in city last night,

177
00:11:57,271 --> 00:11:58,612
and he wants to go back.

178
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,468
The City?

179
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:03,536
Yeah Shane was just telling us how he
went to Studio 54 last night.

180
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:05,996
Studio 54?

181
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,447
That is that big disco everybody is
talking about.

182
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,592
Where all the stars go...

183
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:09,808
Yeah Dad, you should have seen it.

184
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:11,702
Hey I saw a star once, Bob Hope!

185
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:13,012
You see him there?

186
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:17,522
Thanks for the memories Dad,
but it wasn't a Korean war show.

187
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,431
What else, Shane?

188
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,025
Well I went up into the balcony.

189
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:32,472
It was pretty...

190
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:39,124
It was pretty dark.

191
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,394
The girl who cut my hair,

192
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:19,324
had this boyfriend, whose sister did
the books for Steve Rubell...

193
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:20,785
...and got me an interview.

194
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:24,058
Steve Rubell...a regular Booklyn kid

195
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:26,426
who got his start by running
a few steak houses,

196
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:28,210
...and now on top of the world.

197
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:30,459
He's gorgeous.

198
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,340
Gorgeous, see for yourself.

199
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:35,801
I was warned that Steve didn't hire
any dummies...

200
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:37,080
And I should be on my toes

201
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,939
because he could ask some really
tricky questions.

202
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:40,754
What is two plus two?

203
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:41,625
Huh?

204
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:42,871
You will be fine.

205
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:44,214
You are right, he is gorgeous.

206
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:46,137
Come on in!

207
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,461
Where do bad little bartenders go,
if they don't go to Hell first?

208
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:51,737
Xenon.

209
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,496
Right. A fate worse than death.

210
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,861
So, as of tonight...

211
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,437
The new bartender will be...

212
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,488
Rhett.

213
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,376
Choice.

214
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:05,462
Oh and we got a new busboy.

215
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:06,330
His name is Shane.

216
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,018
Shane! Shane, come here. Come here!

217
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:16,570
I couldn't find the right size.

218
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,325
And remember...

219
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:22,591
It is you boys who are truly
New York's finest.

220
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:27,453
One Chablis! Hey kid!

221
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:30,398
Chablis.

222
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:33,055
So what will it be?

223
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:35,323
What will it be?!

224
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,455
Where did they get you "Rocky?"
Philadelphia?

225
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:41,147
No talking to the animals, busboy.

226
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:42,652
Hang in there baby.

227
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:48,152
Greg man, will you help me please!

228
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,269
This is how it works...

229
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,575
Keep the bottles and the glasses
off the dance floor.

230
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,999
Keep the champagne cold and
keep it flowing.

231
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:57,304
You got to pay attention
to the V.I.P. area.

232
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:59,679
Steve doesn't want them to ever pour
champagne for themselves.

233
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:03,001
Now, listen up...

234
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:05,495
After everybody is all gone,
check the banquettes.

235
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,458
We usually find some pretty good stuff.

236
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:09,688
Is that Julie Black?

237
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:11,905
I think so. Are you ready?

238
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,633
There she was. Julie Black.

239
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:20,475
Man, she looked even better in person
than on TV.

240
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:23,265
She was from Jersey too
and she had made it.

241
00:15:29,604 --> 00:15:32,604
I really got to get out of here
and get some sleep.

242
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,075
Stevie knew that we had no royalty
in this country.

243
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,384
We had celebrity and,

244
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,736
if he could provide opportunity for
regular people to dance with the famous,

245
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,242
...the Studio would be one of a kind.

246
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,817
And I was such a dumb kid.

247
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:44,282
All these famous people,

248
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:45,404
and I didn't know who any of them were.

249
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:46,558
And they would all go,

250
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:47,972
Truman, Oh Truman.

251
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:50,559
And I would be thinking,
who the fuck is Truman?

252
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:53,792
Hey Fiorucci! How are you?

253
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,259
I'm such a big fan of yours.

254
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:56,732
The windows are great. Fabulous!

255
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:04,571
You are so Italian, and adorable,

256
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:05,791
I want to eat you with a spoon, come.

257
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,158
Come with me.

258
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:07,241
I would say it was this big. At least...

259
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:08,286
Did you get his number?

260
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,460
It ain't the size of the ship.
It is the motion of the ocean.

261
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:12,710
Did your mother teach you that?

262
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:13,892
His father.

263
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,128
It sounds kind of defensive to me.

264
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:18,080
I think we are freaking the new kid out.

265
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:19,843
Hey how did you do tonight?

266
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:22,658
Good. I made quite a bit.

267
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,128
He doesn't mean your tips.

268
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:26,081
You went up to the balcony with Patty?

269
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,572
The word gets around fast I guess.

270
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:31,875
So did she do the accent?

271
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,449
So how was she?

272
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,013
Really great.

273
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:36,548
She is a model.

274
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,831
Really?

275
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,425
Have we seen her in anything?

276
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,354
Yeah Vogue. French Vogue.

277
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,497
She is moving on up.

278
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:44,776
She told me "Cosmo".

279
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:46,219
She told me "Women's Wear Daily".

280
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:49,066
Hey I don't care if it was
"Sears & Roebucks". It was hot.

281
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,009
She told you "Women's Wear Daily"?

282
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:53,222
Stop.

283
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:55,107
Oh, I feel a fight coming on.

284
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,938
No way sister.

285
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:01,704
And the extra plate.

286
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,186
Hey don't take anything until everybody
puts their stuff down.

287
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:08,611
Didn't you get anything?

288
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,309
Oh wait.

289
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:16,108
Hello friend!

290
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:26,153
Sometimes you meet people and right away
they feel like family.

291
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:30,735
That is how it was with Greg and Anita.

292
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:33,478
She wanted to be the next Donna Summer.

293
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:35,340
Greg wanted to get ahead,

294
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,620
...just wasn't sure how.

295
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:39,786
Looks like your wedding was dynamite!

296
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,559
Oh put these away.

297
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,087
Anita's studio.

298
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:49,934
Far out. What is this?

299
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,752
Oh these are just for motivation,

300
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:54,575
like when you put a picture of
a fat person on the fridge.

301
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:55,754
So play me something.

302
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:56,938
Yeah, she is unbelievable.

303
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:57,609
Play him something.

304
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:01,391
No, no I'm really tired. I'm really,
really tired.

305
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,946
I have been screaming all night.

306
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,687
Okay I will play something simple.

307
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:48,915
I can't do this.

308
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,860
That was excellent.

309
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,449
No, it wasn't.

310
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:56,267
Shane, follow me.

311
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,484
This place is bad man.

312
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,186
You can stay as long as you want.

313
00:20:08,118 --> 00:20:09,066
Really?

314
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:10,892
Mi casa e su casa.

315
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,721
In mi casa there are three basic
food groups:

316
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:18,027
Solids, liquids and hot smoke.

317
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:32,366
What will it be? What will it be?

318
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:36,909
Can I help you? Yeah. Can I help you?

319
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:42,163
I am looking for American foxes
with big American breasts!

320
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:46,642
I couldn't believe all the shit Greg
told me what was going on at the club.

321
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,527
Bartenders. They had it made.

322
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,957
Drugs, Sex, Connections, Money.

323
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,203
There was an endless supply coming
across the bar.

324
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:55,734
Greg told me, half way through the night

325
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,491
Steve had the bartenders...dump the cash,

326
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:58,771
send it downstairs and,

327
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:00,019
change the tape in the registers.

328
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:02,871
It was a skim job straight out of
the Vegas Casinos...

329
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,693
And Steve Rubell was making
a fortune off of it.

330
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:08,467
Greg was on garbage detail.

331
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:09,432
Anthony?

332
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:10,774
He would take it out the back door

333
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,696
and give it to this guy Anthony
he called the garbage man.

334
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,158
Hey pisanno!

335
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:16,463
How you doing?

336
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:17,682
I really scored, didn't I?

337
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:18,769
Greg told me everything.

338
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:24,144
Alright cowgirl, put that on there
Easy, easy...

339
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,063
Is it all there?

340
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:28,407
Yeah, count it.

341
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:31,098
How much they pay you to wait around
for me, huh kid?

342
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:32,498
Enough.

343
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:33,590
Yeah, you are Italian right?

344
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:34,804
Right on.

345
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:38,170
You ever need to increase your paycheck,
you come to me.

346
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:40,374
I got the best party favors in the place.

347
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:43,003
Oh yeah!

348
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:54,898
Greg...Take it.

349
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:55,537
But I have to...

350
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:58,874
Give it to him. Come on!

351
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,282
You have never seen my palace...

352
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,963
Empty it.

353
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:25,811
Go ahead...

354
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:58,300
Rhett the brand new bartender, quit.

355
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,237
He thinks he is going to model.

356
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:03,095
Really?

357
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:07,423
Yeah, he met Scavullo.

358
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:09,659
And thinks he has got it made.

359
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:12,831
You are a handsome guy.

360
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:16,671
I bet you could model...

361
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:18,396
...if you were a little taller.

362
00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:34,519
It is a new world out there.

363
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:39,386
Old labels and prejudice
don't apply anymore.

364
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:40,541
Right.

365
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:41,723
Right.

366
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:45,149
You do a special job for us...

367
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:46,332
Important...

368
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,066
Before you...

369
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,751
I only let bartenders deal with Anthony...

370
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:53,504
But Viv trusts you.

371
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,386
It is a good job, I take it seriously.

372
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,539
She also says you are married to Anita.

373
00:24:01,476 --> 00:24:04,542
And that you never go with
the other boys.

374
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:08,605
Yeah. I mean no.

375
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:09,658
I'm not gay.

376
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,700
Labels...

377
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:14,267
I'm sorry I forgot, Mister Rubell.

378
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:21,434
Mister! Oh, that's good.

379
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,139
Well you know what? I'm not gay either...

380
00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:35,101
I want to suck your cock.

381
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:39,076
I'm married.

382
00:24:40,102 --> 00:24:43,364
No one gets married at your age,

383
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,536
unless you are trying to prove something.

384
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:50,241
I have to go, sorry...

385
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:55,491
Bartenders make a lot of this.

386
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,139
I know.

387
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:01,437
Come here.

388
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:06,785
Come here.

389
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:30,854
I can't...

390
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:33,093
I'm married and she is waiting.

391
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:35,201
You really are that straight.

392
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:35,840
Sorry.

393
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:37,704
No, no, no...

394
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:46,688
I respect that. Let me apologize.

395
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,543
Bye dad!

396
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:16,139
Bye!

397
00:26:37,582 --> 00:26:39,305
Listen Gracy...

398
00:26:39,342 --> 00:26:41,414
You know I'm sorry about leaving you,

399
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:42,533
and Kelly like this,

400
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:44,362
but I should have been out of the house
two years ago.

401
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,317
No shit, Shaney.

402
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,044
Yes we want variety.

403
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,420
Yes you got to toss the salad...

404
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:08,172
...but no, that doesn't mean
letting in whores,

405
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:09,733
and yid's, like last night.

406
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:10,985
They were your cousins, Stevie.

407
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:13,479
I don't care if it was my
Mother and my Father.

408
00:27:13,552 --> 00:27:15,374
They look like shit.

409
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:16,455
Okay, Stevie.

410
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:19,245
No, no, no, no okay Stevie,
no it is cool.

411
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,036
Family my ass, lets go.

412
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,666
These fuckers are hot,

413
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:24,136
what do you think?

414
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:26,798
Fabulous love. Now get out of here.

415
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:30,149
Get out of here! Lets go!

416
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:33,575
Hey can I talk to you about maybe
putting somebody on the list?

417
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,894
You have to talk to Steve,

418
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:37,388
and he has been working
seventy-two hours straight,

419
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:39,148
so you tread lightly.

420
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:41,834
The IRS, oh please...

421
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:42,920
Even though you pay me like a cashier,

422
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,369
I'm the accountant in the place...

423
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,059
...and it is me who is going down
with you.

424
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,137
You get caught by blabbing your
big mouth all over the place.

425
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,927
Do me a favor, throw away that
nasty weed of yours.

426
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,329
Because paranoia is setting in.

427
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:57,648
Hi!

428
00:27:57,683 --> 00:28:00,301
Hi. How is the new kid?

429
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,633
You need a little something
for the night?

430
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:10,473
Buck tells me, you have been doing
a good job.

431
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:12,845
What sign are you?

432
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,717
Umm, Cancer.

433
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:18,861
Cancer, good people Cancer...

434
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:21,451
What do you think Viv?

435
00:28:21,844 --> 00:28:23,251
Crabs.

436
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:28,941
Steve umm, I wanted to
talk to you about...

437
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:33,939
I got some friends I wanted to
find about putting them on the list.

438
00:28:35,158 --> 00:28:36,751
Do they look like you?

439
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,341
One is my cousin.

440
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:42,666
Let me explain something kid, okay...

441
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:43,788
Once a month...

442
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:46,000
the nephew of the King of Saudi Arabia,

443
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:48,426
flies...7000 miles...

444
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:50,673
to dance here for one night, all night.

445
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:53,295
Then gets back on his plane at sunrise.

446
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,984
He tells me it is the only place
on Earth...

447
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:57,811
...that he feels totally free.

448
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,037
So naturally, I,

449
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,468
...we, have a responsibility.

450
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:08,017
So I repeat. Do they look like you?

451
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:11,349
They are my friends.

452
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:18,861
Fine. I'll put them on the list...

453
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,294
But they better look like you.

454
00:29:25,688 --> 00:29:26,615
Thanks.

455
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:56,025
Julie?

456
00:29:58,522 --> 00:30:00,856
You are a mess, come here.

457
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:08,657
Hey did you sleep with somebody
to get your job?

458
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:11,253
My job, please.

459
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:22,932
Listen Shane, you better watch how much
you party, or you will get fired.

460
00:30:22,971 --> 00:30:24,400
Here.

461
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,094
I don't do that crud.

462
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:29,236
Come on, you need an equalizer.

463
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:32,279
Come on. You look like Stevie.

464
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:44,692
There you go.

465
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:48,087
Steve could be a rat-bastard,

466
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,237
there is no question about it.

467
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:51,386
He took my friends off the list,

468
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:53,144
as soon as I left his office.

469
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:56,436
Look again man. Shane invited us,
Shane O'Shea.

470
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:57,525
He works here.

471
00:30:58,238 --> 00:30:59,252
I told them later that,

472
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,081
Steve was always playing
little games like that...

473
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:02,453
...just cruel,

474
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:04,052
never figured out why.

475
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,132
With the kind of power he had,
why play games?

476
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:10,235
He was weird that way.

477
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:12,856
Like some nights he would keep
the club almost empty.

478
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:14,683
There would be a thousand people out
on the streets,

479
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:16,344
...and only a hundred inside dancing.

480
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:21,334
Shane look, it is Billie Austin.

481
00:31:22,143 --> 00:31:24,030
Billie, what is her deal?

482
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,620
She knows everybody.

483
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:29,436
Especially everybody in
the music industry.

484
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:31,711
Help me out, she is into coke.

485
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:33,438
You want to meet her?

486
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:52,094
Oh thanks.

487
00:31:52,128 --> 00:31:54,975
Diana, help herself to the
last of my snow.

488
00:31:56,257 --> 00:31:58,111
Recording artist...

489
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,241
You know Anita is a recording artist too.

490
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,343
Oh? Wonderful, what label?

491
00:32:06,082 --> 00:32:09,464
Well I don't really have one yet.

492
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,860
Oh so send me a tape, I would
love to hear it.

493
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,246
Thank you! Thank you!

494
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:23,704
As a matter of fact, I think I have
a tape here with me.

495
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,688
The recording is not that great...

496
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:35,361
Home equipment...

497
00:32:35,748 --> 00:32:36,762
Bye!

498
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,490
They are cute.

499
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:53,596
I just love discovering new talent.

500
00:32:57,189 --> 00:33:03,419
You have the body of David and the
face of a Bottchelli.

501
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:05,821
Bottle of what?

502
00:33:06,182 --> 00:33:08,036
Just say thanks, darling.

503
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:14,590
It is really funky but,

504
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:15,940
I don't think it is me.

505
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,787
Darling, I don't think you realize
what is you.

506
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,096
I just want to look cool when I'm out,

507
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:21,444
...like a New Yorker.

508
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:27,621
What you are, is part of
Billie's Big Bang theory.

509
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:29,372
Billie taught me how the world worked.

510
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:33,156
How I had the power to get
whatever it was I wanted.

511
00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:35,557
Oh yes!

512
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,269
Rhett...When did he quit?

513
00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:43,773
Tonight.

514
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:45,381
Oh I was crushed.

515
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:47,009
He was incredible.

516
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:53,607
Whoa! Can't wait!

517
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:56,323
Easy, easy!

518
00:33:57,833 --> 00:34:00,451
Yeah! Now try this.

519
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:10,153
Ooh, you learn fast!

520
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,886
I bet I could do that job.

521
00:34:16,394 --> 00:34:18,695
Should I talk to Stevie for you?

522
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:21,443
I don't know.

523
00:34:21,707 --> 00:34:23,561
My friend has been waiting for that job.

524
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:25,761
But do you want it?

525
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:28,261
Yeah, I want it.

526
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,918
What would you do to get it?

527
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,540
Who is it?

528
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:20,931
That ought to be illegal.

529
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:55,910
May I help you?

530
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:06,412
Rhett quit. Job...you know...

531
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:08,842
Let me get this straight.

532
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:10,604
You want a job?

533
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:12,713
Shouldn't I be taking my pants off?

534
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:33,362
Of course everyone knows
Rhett is history...

535
00:36:34,163 --> 00:36:36,747
And Shane will take his place.

536
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,077
Later on I learned that,

537
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,570
Billie had spoken to Stevie
about my promotion.

538
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:45,420
I have to admit, I felt bad for Greg.

539
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,514
I name you Shane 54!

540
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:06,481
We were both right,

541
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:10,539
too short and I do not suck cock.

542
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,866
Well there is nothing you can do
about being short.

543
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:25,813
I'm going to make us some real money.

544
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,187
I got other ideas.

545
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:36,438
How about the best fuck of your lifetime?

546
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:47,788
So I made it.

547
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:50,002
Bartending was the best job in the world.

548
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,249
But for me the big thing was,

549
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:53,076
when you are a bartender at "54",

550
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:54,288
everybody knew your name.

551
00:37:56,216 --> 00:37:57,393
You were famous.

552
00:37:58,104 --> 00:38:00,689
Come on, I want to introduce you to him.

553
00:38:02,424 --> 00:38:06,352
He doesn't want to be
photographed tonight.

554
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:10,477
Steve didn't draw a line between
customers and employees.

555
00:38:10,776 --> 00:38:12,150
Before "54",

556
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:13,198
most clubs would hide their help.

557
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,923
Not Steve, he flaunted his.

558
00:38:19,225 --> 00:38:21,843
People made such a big deal about
getting into "54",

559
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:23,222
but they didn't know,

560
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:24,719
because once you got into the door...

561
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,703
...you wanted to get into
the D.J.'s booth,

562
00:38:26,778 --> 00:38:28,752
or the office where the best coke was,

563
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:30,547
or the balcony where the people were
getting laid,

564
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:33,105
or the basement where the
biggest names hung out.

565
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,634
Steve was so fucking smart.

566
00:38:36,891 --> 00:38:38,614
I mean you would have to be
some kind of genius

567
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:41,367
to take a dirty wet basement...
and turn it into a VIP room,

568
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,344
which celebrities would kill
to get into.

569
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,683
There was always another door.

570
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:48,760
Shane darling, I guess you
finally arrived.

571
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,128
Hi, Andy.

572
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:54,746
Shane, Shane, this is Andy.

573
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,022
Oh yeah, wow!

574
00:38:56,828 --> 00:38:57,940
Andy loves it down here,

575
00:38:58,012 --> 00:38:59,538
...don't you, Andy?

576
00:38:59,611 --> 00:39:01,683
Oh yeah, it is really brown.

577
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,542
Even outside the club,

578
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:04,826
I was always working it.

579
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,705
Getting an article placed in "Interview",

580
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:09,974
mingling with the right people.

581
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:11,030
I got it.

582
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:12,479
Raising my profile.

583
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,626
It was all coming together.

584
00:40:41,763 --> 00:40:43,585
Billie got me and Anita an invitation,

585
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:44,928
...to Liz Vangelder's

586
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:47,067
because she knew there would be
some great contacts for us.

587
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:49,182
Her dinner parties were really
a big deal.

588
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:51,639
Hi I'm Shane. This is Anita.

589
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,991
We are Billie's friends.

590
00:40:53,314 --> 00:40:56,183
Yes, of course. I'm Liz Vangelder.

591
00:40:56,227 --> 00:40:59,042
Well, the night life here is
amusing enough I suppose.

592
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:05,146
Believe me, nothing compares to London
in the swinging sixties.

593
00:41:06,788 --> 00:41:07,867
Come on, where did you find them?

594
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:10,463
L'universite de cinquante-quatre.

595
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:16,739
"54?" The bartender at "54"?

596
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:18,333
You sly puss...

597
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:21,795
Bringing a bartender to the table.

598
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:26,489
Steve is holding auditions
for a New Years act.

599
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:28,959
He says he wants something fresh.

600
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,555
Nobody is as fresh as me.

601
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:35,140
I might even have a tape with, you know,
in my purse.

602
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,335
Really, I have a tape deck in my...

603
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:39,649
So here I was,

604
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:41,343
putting my Jersey moves on Park Avenue.

605
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:44,604
I really believed I had come out of
there with some good connections.

606
00:41:44,998 --> 00:41:49,668
You have the essence of Errol Flynn.

607
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:51,774
Instead, I saw how far I have to go.

608
00:41:53,254 --> 00:41:54,661
Who?

609
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:56,482
Darling, you know who Errol Flynn is?

610
00:41:57,574 --> 00:42:00,323
Oh yeah, Arrow Flynn. Right.

611
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:09,087
You know you are the most gorgeous
troglodyte I have ever seen!

612
00:42:09,768 --> 00:42:11,197
Thanks...

613
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:21,410
Shane, I don't know who the fuck
Arrow Flint is either!

614
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:24,131
But don't you know what a troglodyte is?

615
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:25,990
Yeah, it's like a diamond.

616
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:31,302
A troglodyte is like a caveman.

617
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:34,336
He called you a caveman.

618
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:36,002
And that makes me a cave woman.

619
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:41,892
Anita, are you ready?

620
00:42:44,138 --> 00:42:45,599
Yeah, in a minute.

621
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:48,225
What are you doing?

622
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:51,109
He is giving me a break.

623
00:42:53,162 --> 00:42:56,227
And Shane, lay off.

624
00:43:16,651 --> 00:43:18,080
Where is the article?

625
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:20,745
"Shane 54, I can do anybody"

626
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:37,061
See if you had let me be involved
in the photo-shoot,

627
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:38,694
this wouldn't have happened.

628
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:41,388
You should have known with a
magazine like this!

629
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,428
Anita, lay off. Please.

630
00:43:49,038 --> 00:43:51,242
Come on, I know how to cheer you up.

631
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:55,209
So we are going to start with the hips.

632
00:43:55,247 --> 00:43:58,280
One, two, three, four...

633
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,691
For extra dough Anita taught
suburbanites how to disco dance.

634
00:43:59,726 --> 00:44:03,654
Well, she tried anyway.

635
00:44:10,287 --> 00:44:13,320
Second thing, we are going to do
is attitude.

636
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,668
If you want to make it to Studio 54...

637
00:44:14,704 --> 00:44:17,551
...the most important thing is
you've to have the right attitude,

638
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:19,503
and the attitude is in face.

639
00:44:19,568 --> 00:44:21,226
So we are going to go, watch me now,

640
00:44:21,296 --> 00:44:23,052
because this is a very
special step for attitude.

641
00:44:23,088 --> 00:44:25,990
One, two, three, four. One, two, three,

642
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:26,795
...attitude!

643
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:30,061
One, two, three, attitude!

644
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:32,623
Give me some attitude!

645
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:38,694
Give me some attitude, show me! Show me!
Show me your stuff!

646
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:51,693
Think Travolta, come on!

647
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,693
Keep going, keep going!

648
00:44:55,731 --> 00:44:57,454
I'm going to go for some inspiration.

649
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:01,547
Oh please, Shane just give me
some inspiration.

650
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:18,223
Hey!

651
00:45:18,995 --> 00:45:19,856
Hey!

652
00:45:19,892 --> 00:45:20,906
Keep your hands off my wife!

653
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:22,409
Don't smother me, Grego!

654
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:26,801
Oh thank you, I was so hungry.

655
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,550
Are you going to stay for the busto'?

656
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:34,092
Sounds great but I got some
business of my own.

657
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,322
Shane, why don't you show us
how you do your splits?

658
00:45:37,588 --> 00:45:39,082
I'm not going to do that Mario,
you do that.

659
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:40,079
Alright.

660
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,382
Shane!

661
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:44,078
I leave you alone for one second,

662
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:45,099
and look what happens!

663
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:46,002
Are you alright, does it hurt?

664
00:45:46,325 --> 00:45:47,339
Just a little.

665
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:49,071
Don't move. I'm going to go get some ice.

666
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,930
I'm sorry.

667
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:23,756
'Ludes, Angel Dust...And this,
this is MDA.

668
00:46:24,056 --> 00:46:25,878
This is why the "Studio" is
such a great party.

669
00:46:26,264 --> 00:46:27,212
This month anyhow.

670
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:44,175
Thanks.

671
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:50,130
You can do it too, man.

672
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,559
Hey midget! I hear you got some
choice MDA.

673
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,864
Twenty each, for you...twenty-five.

674
00:46:58,937 --> 00:47:00,977
Oh eat me raw, Tom Thumb.

675
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,221
I never pay for my drugs.

676
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:04,822
And I don't take medicare.

677
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:10,671
So tell me, how much money does
the club pull in?

678
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:17,233
I'd say, we...I make...

679
00:47:17,274 --> 00:47:20,241
$750,000.00...Every night.

680
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:24,759
And that would be before Uncle Sam
gets his teeth into it?

681
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:26,904
Let me put it this way,

682
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:29,459
what the IRS doesn't know
won't hurt them.

683
00:47:31,036 --> 00:47:32,279
Let me put it this way,

684
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:34,933
what the IRS doesn't know
won't hurt them.

685
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:38,108
The secret is that I'm, I'm kind of
a philosopher...

686
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:40,083
Can you believe the nerve of this man?

687
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:42,643
He did Merv last week, Dick Cavet,

688
00:47:42,684 --> 00:47:43,894
...and now this!

689
00:47:43,932 --> 00:47:47,576
I understand the path of excess
leads to the palace of wisdom.

690
00:47:47,612 --> 00:47:48,724
Do you ever read Blake?

691
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:49,876
I have.

692
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:52,217
Yeah, I love Blake. That is
my favorite poet.

693
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:54,107
You got to get to somebody in that place.

694
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:58,321
That is right, I love that.
May I kiss your hand?

695
00:47:59,581 --> 00:48:01,686
You know, I've been good
for the whole week now.

696
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:03,891
Yeah? Yeah.

697
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:07,675
Well, keep being good and quit
looking at me like that.

698
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:11,517
I'm not looking at you.

699
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:13,784
Who would want to look at you!

700
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:29,880
Hey, give me that.

701
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,119
Stop it.

702
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,620
C'mon, I want to help.
Guys do everything.

703
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:36,183
No...it's not because you don't, but...

704
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,533
Are you trying to turn me on?

705
00:48:37,568 --> 00:48:38,997
No. I'm trying to cook.

706
00:48:39,073 --> 00:48:40,087
Say that again.

707
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,207
What?

708
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:44,123
You're insulting me, babe,
because you know...

709
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,301
C'mon, let me go...

710
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,567
Oh right! I was just after the spoon.

711
00:48:59,105 --> 00:49:00,665
Spoon?!

712
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:14,519
You bastard. You jealous bastard!

713
00:49:14,595 --> 00:49:17,212
You won't just get away... Lay off.

714
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,290
I didn't even do anything.

715
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,507
Right! Right!

716
00:49:20,546 --> 00:49:22,007
I told you nothing's going on.

717
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,293
Bullshit!

718
00:49:25,026 --> 00:49:28,801
Greg, baby, you're talking about Shane.

719
00:49:29,123 --> 00:49:30,748
If you like, doing...

720
00:49:30,787 --> 00:49:31,680
How can I?

721
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:33,056
I caught you.

722
00:49:33,092 --> 00:49:35,230
You are a jealous maniac and you better
get over it,

723
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,893
because I'm not sticking around for more!

724
00:49:37,572 --> 00:49:39,066
You're threatening me?

725
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,580
I told you before we got married
that I'm not your slave!

726
00:49:43,653 --> 00:49:44,700
"No smothering, Grego", right?

727
00:49:44,772 --> 00:49:45,568
Right!

728
00:49:45,604 --> 00:49:46,977
Right? Right?

729
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:49,880
And you agreed, remember?

730
00:50:02,149 --> 00:50:07,616
You are the only one I love.
You're my baby.

731
00:50:08,325 --> 00:50:10,147
My baby!

732
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:01,853
Hi.

733
00:51:02,857 --> 00:51:04,286
Hi. Do I...

734
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:05,670
Shane.

735
00:51:06,505 --> 00:51:07,879
Nice to meet you, Shane.

736
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:09,153
Lets go, Julie.

737
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:16,258
No ticket, no coat.

738
00:51:16,681 --> 00:51:18,371
Just look for it.

739
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,355
Do you know how many black
leather jackets,

740
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:23,459
with poppers and a cock-ring in the
left pocket we got back here?

741
00:51:42,507 --> 00:51:43,914
You are killing me!

742
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,168
Hey!

743
00:51:52,749 --> 00:51:53,827
What's wrong?

744
00:51:53,868 --> 00:51:55,722
I started to take a leak and it felt
like razor blades.

745
00:51:57,772 --> 00:51:58,884
Oh, oh...

746
00:51:58,923 --> 00:52:00,068
What?

747
00:52:00,396 --> 00:52:01,890
Don't tell me it is your first...

748
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,714
My first what?

749
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:07,179
You got "the clap" man.

750
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:08,643
Shit.

751
00:52:09,132 --> 00:52:10,309
Wake up.

752
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:19,336
Penicillin, huh?

753
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:24,333
We must be neighbors. I live just...

754
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:30,373
Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.

755
00:52:31,438 --> 00:52:32,964
Thanks.

756
00:52:36,655 --> 00:52:39,175
Shit.

757
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:45,381
Thanks, Dottie.

758
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:47,621
It is Mona,

759
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,151
but that is just between you and
me too, okay?

760
00:52:51,152 --> 00:52:51,948
Okay.

761
00:52:52,304 --> 00:52:53,711
Grandma, look it.

762
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,745
Oh, that is beautiful.

763
00:52:59,823 --> 00:53:01,928
Now can you say hi to Shane?

764
00:53:01,968 --> 00:53:02,534
Hi.

765
00:53:02,576 --> 00:53:03,623
Hi.

766
00:53:05,456 --> 00:53:10,573
Sweetmeat, sweetmeat, give Disco Dottie
her funky little treat.

767
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:13,103
Hey Atlanta, we need more champagne
on the banquettes.

768
00:53:13,873 --> 00:53:15,596
Anthony is having a cow.

769
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:18,288
He said we were short a thousand
the other night.

770
00:53:18,513 --> 00:53:19,145
Yeah?

771
00:53:19,185 --> 00:53:19,500
Yeah.

772
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:21,642
I have a friend at Xenon who will
put you to work,

773
00:53:21,714 --> 00:53:23,208
and not bitch about it.

774
00:53:23,282 --> 00:53:26,129
Why don't you go dance?
It is slowing down out there.

775
00:53:32,146 --> 00:53:33,323
What?

776
00:53:34,034 --> 00:53:35,659
I'm letting you go, you are fired.

777
00:53:36,306 --> 00:53:37,385
You can't fire me,

778
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:38,254
why would you want to?

779
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:39,337
Your sticky little fingers,

780
00:53:39,378 --> 00:53:40,621
didn't you think Anthony would notice?

781
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:42,190
Notice what?

782
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:46,928
Oh, you're embarrassing yourself.
Here is your severance.

783
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:55,056
Stevie, I have worked for you,
for ten years.

784
00:53:56,148 --> 00:53:58,188
I helped you get your first steak house.

785
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,137
You have been here too long.

786
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:04,048
Your paranoia is getting to me.

787
00:54:05,044 --> 00:54:07,313
If there is money missing,
look someplace else.

788
00:54:07,604 --> 00:54:09,197
Anthony is having a cow, okay!

789
00:54:09,237 --> 00:54:11,179
And somebody's head has to roll!

790
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:23,053
Ladies and Gentlemen, Christmas present
from me to you.

791
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:32,471
Every night I think about staying home,

792
00:55:32,506 --> 00:55:37,491
but then I come to my senses and
give myself a good kick in the ass.

793
00:55:57,851 --> 00:55:59,607
Man, look at this pit!

794
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,285
Nicotine break.

795
00:56:03,356 --> 00:56:04,338
Right on.

796
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,197
I thought this night would never end.

797
00:56:10,748 --> 00:56:12,406
Thank God, it is Christmas.

798
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:14,488
Can't wait to get out of here.

799
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:17,850
Are you going home tommorow?

800
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:19,095
No.

801
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:22,072
I haven't talked to my Dad in
four months.

802
00:56:24,445 --> 00:56:26,649
Why don't you come with me and Anita
to her Mother's,

803
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:28,022
...It will be fun.

804
00:56:30,206 --> 00:56:31,067
Thanks.

805
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,692
Yeah.

806
00:56:34,365 --> 00:56:36,732
Lets clean this place up.
Lets get out of this hole.

807
00:56:36,766 --> 00:56:38,489
Hey you hear, Romeo is quitting
New Year's Eve.

808
00:56:38,526 --> 00:56:39,768
If you think I'm ever
going to get that job,

809
00:56:39,806 --> 00:56:40,820
...you are dreaming.

810
00:56:41,534 --> 00:56:42,777
He is never going to promote me.

811
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:46,129
Listen, I'll talk to him.

812
00:56:47,646 --> 00:56:48,573
Alright.

813
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:50,013
Anyway when we have our own place,

814
00:56:50,046 --> 00:56:51,639
we will get to do all the hiring, right?

815
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:52,824
Yeah right.

816
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:58,137
Alright, I'll meet you downstairs when
you are finished with this stuff.

817
00:56:58,175 --> 00:56:59,549
Say what?

818
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:03,065
Steve doesn't want me to do anymore
of the bussing or anything.

819
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:05,751
Are you for real?

820
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,576
What?

821
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:12,571
You're getting so conceited. It's like
don't know who I'm talking to anymore.

822
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:14,649
What is your problem, man?

823
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:16,122
You pour drinks,

824
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:17,719
you hang out with some high-class
stuck up assholes...

825
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,839
...and suddenly you are some big star,

826
00:57:18,879 --> 00:57:20,024
you can't get your hands dirty.

827
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,189
Look at you, dealing more drugs than
"Johnson & Johnson".

828
00:57:24,448 --> 00:57:25,462
Hey that money is for Anita's studio.

829
00:57:25,504 --> 00:57:26,551
You know that.

830
00:57:26,593 --> 00:57:27,836
Oh, I see...

831
00:57:27,872 --> 00:57:29,628
You know what, Shane, your head is
filled up with so much shit,

832
00:57:29,665 --> 00:57:30,908
you don't even know what you are
talking about.

833
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:33,149
Hey, Greg, cool it man. I'm your friend.

834
00:57:33,441 --> 00:57:36,757
Yeah, friend, who is trying to
scope my wife.

835
00:57:36,802 --> 00:57:38,045
What the hell are you talking about?

836
00:57:38,114 --> 00:57:40,186
She is the only girl this side of
Fifth Avenue you haven't balled.

837
00:57:40,258 --> 00:57:41,305
You don't know what you're talking about.

838
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:44,672
Fuck you, Shane 54!

839
00:58:12,452 --> 00:58:13,662
Come on.

840
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,292
Lay off!

841
00:58:15,716 --> 00:58:16,643
Lets get out of here.

842
00:58:16,707 --> 00:58:17,884
Sit on it!

843
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:20,098
Fuck off!

844
00:58:20,131 --> 00:58:21,407
I'm not your slave!

845
00:58:53,798 --> 00:58:55,707
You know, I told him before
we got married...

846
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,855
I told him what the deal was.

847
00:58:58,182 --> 00:59:00,254
I said, I love you but need to be free,

848
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:01,668
I need to have fun.

849
00:59:01,703 --> 00:59:03,939
You know maybe not forever, but for now!

850
00:59:04,038 --> 00:59:08,162
And he said, okay, okay. You know,
whatever you need.

851
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:09,759
I want you to be free...

852
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:11,075
My ass!

853
00:59:11,879 --> 00:59:19,167
I could fucking kill him, when he
gets like that!

854
00:59:22,824 --> 00:59:24,198
What's wrong?

855
01:00:05,163 --> 01:00:07,683
Shane, Shane stop!

856
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:08,519
Shane, he is there.

857
01:00:08,554 --> 01:00:09,666
Let him watch.

858
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:11,370
This is bad for him.

859
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:38,855
The Dow Jones Industrial continued
its slide today,

860
01:00:38,893 --> 01:00:42,122
bringing the two day drop to forty
points. The news from Washington today...

861
01:00:53,773 --> 01:00:55,114
Where you been, turkey!

862
01:00:55,149 --> 01:00:56,578
Great to see you, Gracie!

863
01:00:56,877 --> 01:00:57,804
Are those for us?

864
01:00:58,189 --> 01:01:00,196
Whoa! Tinsel teeth!

865
01:01:00,238 --> 01:01:02,310
Thanks to you, I shouldn't have
taken your money.

866
01:01:03,022 --> 01:01:04,265
Lets go in, I'm freezing.

867
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:07,082
Whoa, nice car. Is it yours?

868
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:08,999
I'm famous, you know.

869
01:01:09,038 --> 01:01:10,980
Yeah I know, we saw you,

870
01:01:11,022 --> 01:01:12,396
in the paper, dancing with some old lady.

871
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:15,179
And I read that Princess Grace
showed up there too.

872
01:01:15,215 --> 01:01:16,294
Did you tell her about us?

873
01:01:17,264 --> 01:01:18,671
I was off that night.

874
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:22,058
Come on, I'm starved.

875
01:01:22,127 --> 01:01:23,141
Why don't we go for a ride,

876
01:01:23,216 --> 01:01:24,143
I mean no one is home anyway.

877
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,835
What?

878
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:28,042
They went to Aunt Mary's.

879
01:01:35,152 --> 01:01:36,875
Ricko's aunt got into the studio
one night...

880
01:01:36,912 --> 01:01:37,991
And she told us...

881
01:01:38,032 --> 01:01:39,111
she saw you putting something
up your nose.

882
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,716
She is such a liar.

883
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,869
Hey, maybe you can come in,
I'll try to talk him into it.

884
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:45,992
No thanks!

885
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:06,024
Don't make them right about you, Shane.

886
01:02:06,066 --> 01:02:07,789
There is nothing wrong with this stuff,
Gracie.

887
01:02:07,826 --> 01:02:08,753
He drinks,

888
01:02:08,786 --> 01:02:09,963
it is the same thing.

889
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,747
Good. I want to try one of these.

890
01:02:45,237 --> 01:02:47,277
In the morning, I went to breakfast
at the Alpine Inn,

891
01:02:47,349 --> 01:02:50,611
like we used to, the day after Christmas
when mom was alive.

892
01:02:52,693 --> 01:02:54,416
Could I get a cappuccino, please?

893
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:56,078
Excuse me?

894
01:03:01,013 --> 01:03:02,474
Wrong side of the river!

895
01:03:03,765 --> 01:03:04,626
Hey...

896
01:03:06,037 --> 01:03:07,214
Hi.

897
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:08,979
I'm Shane, we met at the...

898
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:11,218
Yeah, I know who you are.

899
01:03:13,366 --> 01:03:16,213
Would you mind? Could I...

900
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:19,828
Sure.

901
01:03:33,111 --> 01:03:34,704
What are you doing out here?

902
01:03:34,775 --> 01:03:36,684
Spending the week with my parents.

903
01:03:38,775 --> 01:03:41,360
You look like you crawled out
from under a rock.

904
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,684
Well it hasn't been the
greatest homecoming.

905
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,897
I see.

906
01:03:47,545 --> 01:03:50,228
Hey waitress, two cups of coffee, please!

907
01:03:51,352 --> 01:03:52,977
When in Rome...

908
01:03:58,873 --> 01:04:00,280
It is a whole other world, huh!

909
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:02,583
You will learn. Two languages,

910
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:05,038
two sets of clothes, two sets of friends.

911
01:04:05,433 --> 01:04:06,709
You kept your friends out here.

912
01:04:06,746 --> 01:04:09,877
Well no, actually the clothes were
a lot easier.

913
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:15,031
It is insane, isn't it?

914
01:04:16,058 --> 01:04:17,880
I mean, Manhattan is a whole
other problem,

915
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:19,344
it is up one minute, down the next.

916
01:04:19,386 --> 01:04:21,273
Story of my life, one thousand percent.

917
01:04:21,306 --> 01:04:23,378
Two thousand percent.

918
01:04:31,004 --> 01:04:33,753
You know, I have had so much coffee,
I'm realy to take flight.

919
01:04:36,923 --> 01:04:39,094
Bird of Paradise.

920
01:04:50,909 --> 01:04:52,054
Hold on...

921
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:57,010
So you remember today.

922
01:05:02,013 --> 01:05:03,125
Thank you.

923
01:05:18,078 --> 01:05:19,321
Whoa...

924
01:05:19,646 --> 01:05:20,791
Who would have thought!

925
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,073
What?

926
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:25,242
That you were so sweet.

927
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:29,338
You got to tell us what we want to
hear about him,

928
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:30,618
or we are going to nail you.

929
01:05:30,847 --> 01:05:33,148
We are talking an audit that goes
all the way back.

930
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:36,122
And my friend, we find something
we don't like,

931
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:37,752
and believe me, we will...

932
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,138
Guess what, your house, is gone.
Your car, is gone.

933
01:05:42,207 --> 01:05:44,924
You...are seriously gone.

934
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,715
I'm talking 10 to 20 years.

935
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:49,047
You want to investigate, go ahead.

936
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,077
My car, not in my name. My house,
not in my name.

937
01:05:54,112 --> 01:05:56,730
My back account, don't have one.

938
01:05:56,768 --> 01:05:59,037
You know what I got? Agates.

939
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:01,277
What about the drugs?

940
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:03,194
Were they in your name?

941
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:05,561
They were in the glove compartment.

942
01:06:09,122 --> 01:06:10,233
Yes!

943
01:06:12,257 --> 01:06:14,646
Wow, you are good.

944
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,630
Four brothers, and I never lost a game.

945
01:06:19,586 --> 01:06:21,211
Oh really. I have been meaning to
tell you something.

946
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,018
It is sort of embarrassing...

947
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:26,710
You can tell me,

948
01:06:26,754 --> 01:06:28,183
...what are you talking about?

949
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:34,298
After I saw that picture of you
in that gossip column...

950
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,149
It was, you know, inspiring.

951
01:06:37,187 --> 01:06:38,397
What?

952
01:06:38,755 --> 01:06:40,827
I mean it, just to see someone else,

953
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:42,011
...from Jersey who made it.

954
01:06:42,946 --> 01:06:44,768
Made it? You are kidding right.

955
01:06:44,835 --> 01:06:45,762
I'm on Soap...

956
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:46,940
Right.

957
01:06:47,011 --> 01:06:48,734
Wrong. Soap work is the pits.

958
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,265
Why do you think I'm at "54"
every night?

959
01:06:52,004 --> 01:06:52,986
I don't know.

960
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,547
Maybe to meet somebody interesting?

961
01:06:55,876 --> 01:06:57,217
Exactly.

962
01:06:57,893 --> 01:07:00,314
In this business it is all about
who you know. And since,

963
01:07:00,357 --> 01:07:01,633
I'm going to get a movie or die trying,

964
01:07:01,669 --> 01:07:03,709
...there is no place better than "54".

965
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:09,405
One big bender, with business cards.

966
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:16,641
See the thing is, if you meet the right
producer like Ron Sax for instance,

967
01:07:16,709 --> 01:07:18,138
You got it made.

968
01:07:18,213 --> 01:07:19,358
I mean, he has his hands in everything.

969
01:07:19,429 --> 01:07:22,146
Music, movies, clubs...

970
01:07:22,182 --> 01:07:24,964
Right. But you don't need that.

971
01:07:25,926 --> 01:07:27,452
Shane, come on,

972
01:07:27,494 --> 01:07:28,671
you are a "54" bartender.

973
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,117
You know how things work.

974
01:07:30,438 --> 01:07:31,583
You know what this is all about.

975
01:07:31,622 --> 01:07:33,280
You have had to maneuver.

976
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:34,495
Sometimes you use your charms,

977
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:36,060
...sometimes other things.

978
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:40,029
Okay you got me.

979
01:07:52,808 --> 01:07:54,750
This place is really great.

980
01:07:55,496 --> 01:07:57,568
You can actually see people here.

981
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:00,067
You are so cute.

982
01:08:07,593 --> 01:08:10,113
Starting the decade with
the perfect kiss.

983
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:11,462
What could be better than that?

984
01:08:11,753 --> 01:08:13,346
Picking up that 7-10 split.

985
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:14,464
Oh yeah, I'm going to do it first.

986
01:08:14,698 --> 01:08:16,355
No, you are not! It is mine.

987
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:19,496
Forget it, come on, give me that ball.

988
01:08:33,066 --> 01:08:34,014
Opps.

989
01:08:34,347 --> 01:08:35,940
Yeah of course, you are on the list.

990
01:08:37,898 --> 01:08:38,846
Okay.

991
01:08:40,715 --> 01:08:41,827
What is this?

992
01:08:43,115 --> 01:08:46,595
It is the missing money. I took it.

993
01:08:48,266 --> 01:08:49,640
What money?

994
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:52,489
You know...Anthony's money.

995
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:54,569
Oh that is adorable!

996
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:56,232
Now Greg is very lucky,

997
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,924
to have a friend like you to
cover for him.

998
01:08:59,308 --> 01:09:00,617
You knew?

999
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:05,188
Yeah. You know I see everything
that goes on here.

1000
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:06,754
You don't think that I'm watching,

1001
01:09:06,796 --> 01:09:07,941
...but I am.

1002
01:09:08,332 --> 01:09:09,477
He would have never touched that money

1003
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:11,721
if he had been made a bartender
in the first place.

1004
01:09:12,556 --> 01:09:14,050
He is really a great guy Steve...

1005
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:15,816
He thought he would be a busboy for
the rest of his life.

1006
01:09:15,853 --> 01:09:17,991
Yeah I'm sure

1007
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,555
Can't you give him a break?

1008
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:28,997
So you want me, to make him
a bartender now?

1009
01:09:30,957 --> 01:09:33,924
You know, I am too nice for my own good.

1010
01:09:33,966 --> 01:09:36,649
People take advantage.

1011
01:09:37,518 --> 01:09:38,728
Thanks, Steve.

1012
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:41,388
But don't you say anything to him. Okay?

1013
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:43,565
I'll tell him myself.

1014
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:47,592
Why is everyone so sentimental
this time of year!

1015
01:09:48,367 --> 01:09:51,050
I hate the holidays.

1016
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:09,193
Greg, hey man. It is great to see you.

1017
01:10:09,488 --> 01:10:11,113
I wasn't sure if you were coming back.

1018
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,716
No way,

1019
01:10:12,752 --> 01:10:14,126
I couldn't miss Anita tonight. Plus...

1020
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,396
I should meet up with my
very possibly girlfriend?

1021
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:18,983
Girlfriend? Is that where you have been?

1022
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:21,712
Yeah...Julie Black, man.

1023
01:10:21,778 --> 01:10:22,923
Bull shit!

1024
01:10:22,961 --> 01:10:23,625
I'm not jiving you, I swear.

1025
01:10:23,664 --> 01:10:24,525
Great, man!

1026
01:10:27,217 --> 01:10:29,126
I got to go find Anthony.

1027
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:30,313
You need any party materials?

1028
01:10:30,385 --> 01:10:31,595
No thanks, not tonight.

1029
01:10:37,714 --> 01:10:39,372
Steve!

1030
01:10:40,818 --> 01:10:41,930
Come on, I have been here every holiday.

1031
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,399
It is New Year's eve.

1032
01:10:43,955 --> 01:10:45,132
Please, I'm so Ionely...

1033
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:46,064
Go home, honey.

1034
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,529
This is my home...

1035
01:11:04,372 --> 01:11:05,582
Remember what happens tomorrow?

1036
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:06,796
The new decade, Turkey.

1037
01:11:07,475 --> 01:11:08,882
The new bartender gets announced.

1038
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:12,585
Oh right. It is looking good for you
for sure, man.

1039
01:11:12,628 --> 01:11:13,293
Really?

1040
01:11:13,332 --> 01:11:14,259
Hey! Hey!

1041
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:17,330
Your fairy tale wish just came true.

1042
01:11:17,813 --> 01:11:19,755
I got a very special job for you tonight.

1043
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:21,650
Grace Kelly is coming,

1044
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:23,631
and I want you to take care of her.

1045
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:25,076
No shit!

1046
01:11:25,109 --> 01:11:26,254
Yes.

1047
01:11:26,294 --> 01:11:27,154
but try not to say "shit" around her,
okay...

1048
01:11:27,188 --> 01:11:28,431
She is from Philly,

1049
01:11:28,469 --> 01:11:30,574
but I don't think she does that anymore.

1050
01:11:30,964 --> 01:11:33,331
No, not tonight. Not tonight.

1051
01:11:33,397 --> 01:11:35,601
Never, never, never come to me like that.

1052
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,128
Kelly? Are you sleeping?

1053
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:43,979
Is Gracie there?

1054
01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:47,409
Well tell her, I'm going to meet
Princess Grace tonight.

1055
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:50,164
Ahh! No kidding! No way!

1056
01:12:00,343 --> 01:12:02,066
I just wanted to wish you
good luck tonight.

1057
01:12:02,134 --> 01:12:03,541
You are going to be great.

1058
01:12:09,175 --> 01:12:10,451
Happy New Year!

1059
01:12:13,112 --> 01:12:15,054
Hey, it is Errol Flynn!

1060
01:12:15,096 --> 01:12:18,893
It is great to see you man,
I have been trying to reach you...

1061
01:12:18,936 --> 01:12:20,015
Hold on.

1062
01:12:20,057 --> 01:12:21,169
My date is getting crushed.

1063
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,381
Hi.

1064
01:12:25,433 --> 01:12:26,610
Hi.

1065
01:12:28,185 --> 01:12:29,494
I got a great idea.

1066
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:38,968
Oh come on, it will be wild.

1067
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,493
Some of us are going back to
Roland's house later.

1068
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:42,904
He wants to know, you want to come?

1069
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,767
Actually it will be just us three.

1070
01:12:52,091 --> 01:12:54,578
There goes Donna, excuse me.

1071
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:58,808
I don't understand,

1072
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:02,486
I thought we, you know, connected.

1073
01:13:02,522 --> 01:13:04,016
Shane, I already explained this to you,

1074
01:13:04,059 --> 01:13:07,125
my career is really important to me
right now.

1075
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:09,557
Listen Shane, I like you, I really do...

1076
01:13:09,627 --> 01:13:11,001
...but drop the fantasy, okay?

1077
01:13:11,035 --> 01:13:12,212
I'm building something here,
and I thought,

1078
01:13:12,283 --> 01:13:13,744
...you wanted to get ahead too.

1079
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:16,179
Now Roland's the kind of guy that can
make that happen for you.

1080
01:13:16,219 --> 01:13:17,528
Don't you want that?

1081
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:20,852
Not that way.

1082
01:13:33,629 --> 01:13:35,800
Happy New Year!

1083
01:13:44,894 --> 01:13:50,590
Okay, first I wanted to tell you all
something

1084
01:13:50,621 --> 01:13:52,890
that most of you already know.

1085
01:13:55,422 --> 01:13:57,462
I love you.

1086
01:13:57,758 --> 01:13:59,896
We love you too, Steve!

1087
01:14:07,646 --> 01:14:12,021
Secondly. There have been a few little
rumors floating around...

1088
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:14,614
...about me and a certain
government agency.

1089
01:14:14,687 --> 01:14:17,818
But rest assured, that is all
taken care of.

1090
01:14:17,855 --> 01:14:20,506
Just try and tangle with me!

1091
01:14:23,616 --> 01:14:28,537
And now, I want to introduce you
to a brand new talent...

1092
01:14:28,576 --> 01:14:29,786
A talent for the 80's

1093
01:14:29,825 --> 01:14:31,002
that I discovered in the coat room,

1094
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:32,186
...believe it or not!

1095
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:36,735
Please welcome...Anita!

1096
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:58,593
Tonight is the night I fly. Spread my
wings and touch the sky!

1097
01:15:00,035 --> 01:15:15,835
Tonight is the night I see...everything
that's waiting for me.

1098
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:30,974
I'm loving this new world I'm in,
you know it fits like second skin.

1099
01:15:32,517 --> 01:15:39,674
Then they say it comes and goes so fast,
but we got something built to last.

1100
01:15:39,717 --> 01:15:45,913
Oh baby, it's your love
that sets me free!

1101
01:15:45,988 --> 01:15:52,480
Tonight is the night I fly,
spread my wings and touch the sky!

1102
01:15:52,517 --> 01:16:00,003
Tonight is the night I see everything
that's waiting for me.

1103
01:16:00,038 --> 01:16:13,568
Ohh, yeah, oohh right, tonight I fly!
Tonight is the night!

1104
01:16:13,607 --> 01:16:25,283
I've got to be free!
Everybody gets down!

1105
01:17:05,066 --> 01:17:06,920
Turn on the lights!

1106
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:18,208
Dottie? Dottie?

1107
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:24,490
Mona?

1108
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:29,796
Hey, hey. Princess Grace is here
and she is thirsty.

1109
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:30,798
What?

1110
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:31,779
This way, you are on. Come on.

1111
01:18:31,856 --> 01:18:32,838
No.

1112
01:18:32,912 --> 01:18:37,222
Shaney...It has been a mean night. Okay?

1113
01:18:37,264 --> 01:18:39,533
And I'll cry about it tomorrow. I will.

1114
01:18:39,856 --> 01:18:41,449
But tonight, the show must go on.

1115
01:18:41,488 --> 01:18:42,764
Lets go.

1116
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,742
I can't. I can't talk to anybody.

1117
01:18:44,912 --> 01:18:47,465
We did it to her, this place did.

1118
01:18:49,137 --> 01:18:51,176
Come on, come on. You can't
blame yourself,

1119
01:18:51,216 --> 01:18:53,038
...if she couldn't handle her drugs.

1120
01:18:53,072 --> 01:18:54,282
Come on, lets go.

1121
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,476
It will calm you down. Come on, take it.

1122
01:18:58,993 --> 01:19:00,302
This isn't right.

1123
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:02,922
Princess Grace is here. Okay?

1124
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:04,749
Princess Grace.

1125
01:19:04,785 --> 01:19:05,799
We lost a friend tonight.

1126
01:19:05,873 --> 01:19:07,880
No, no, no. I lost a friend tonight.

1127
01:19:07,922 --> 01:19:09,132
Alright, no offense,

1128
01:19:09,169 --> 01:19:10,314
but you were just another
pretty face to her.

1129
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:11,336
She was my friend.

1130
01:19:11,378 --> 01:19:12,555
Oh, she was completely nearsighted.

1131
01:19:12,594 --> 01:19:14,055
She couldn't tell one of you
from the next.

1132
01:19:14,098 --> 01:19:15,374
Now get it together and get downstairs.

1133
01:19:18,483 --> 01:19:21,745
Hey! Don't forget how replaceable
you are. Little Lord Fauntleroy.

1134
01:19:21,779 --> 01:19:24,112
Try telling them that, Stevie! Remember?

1135
01:19:24,146 --> 01:19:25,706
I'm one of New York's finest,

1136
01:19:25,746 --> 01:19:26,989
I'm Shane 54!

1137
01:19:29,074 --> 01:19:32,205
Like there wasn't a Gabriel 54
and a Rhett 54.

1138
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:33,584
Bullshit!

1139
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:40,017
Don't tell me that is the first time
you ever read an "Interview" Magazine?

1140
01:19:40,339 --> 01:19:41,418
Oh no, it is!

1141
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:48,016
Fuck you, you troglodyte!

1142
01:19:48,436 --> 01:19:51,534
Hey, where you going!
The door is that way!

1143
01:19:52,212 --> 01:19:52,713
He is out!

1144
01:20:16,086 --> 01:20:17,296
I love you.

1145
01:20:29,462 --> 01:20:30,607
IRS.

1146
01:20:36,727 --> 01:20:37,937
They are here.

1147
01:20:41,464 --> 01:20:44,497
Shane, I knew you would come to your
senses. Meine klein Shane.

1148
01:20:44,567 --> 01:20:46,028
I went downstairs to get my keys,

1149
01:20:46,071 --> 01:20:47,500
...and they are raiding the office.

1150
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:57,070
Even from here, those suits look cheap.

1151
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,382
Steve, are you going to get out of here?

1152
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:09,234
Where would I go?

1153
01:21:19,642 --> 01:21:20,535
Lets go, Shane.

1154
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:21,497
What are you guys doing!

1155
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:22,609
Steve wants you out!

1156
01:21:23,834 --> 01:21:28,176
Get off me! Yo' Billy, come on, man!

1157
01:21:30,362 --> 01:21:32,271
Get out of here!

1158
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:34,447
I got to get my wallet!

1159
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:47,257
Hey, these handcuffs are too tight!

1160
01:21:48,027 --> 01:21:49,204
They will leave marks!

1161
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,962
What am I?

1162
01:21:51,003 --> 01:21:52,977
Public Enemy Number One
for Christ's sake!

1163
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:01,434
This is so tacky.

1164
01:22:16,285 --> 01:22:17,594
Shane!

1165
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:20,377
You want a ride?

1166
01:22:29,343 --> 01:22:32,244
Look Shane, I'm sorry. I know I
acted like a fool,

1167
01:22:32,285 --> 01:22:34,357
but you know how it is in there.

1168
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:37,593
Where is Roland?

1169
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:39,799
I lost him in the balcony.

1170
01:22:41,342 --> 01:22:44,276
I'm sorry. Come on.

1171
01:22:44,575 --> 01:22:45,589
What about your career?

1172
01:22:45,663 --> 01:22:46,742
I thought that was your big priority.

1173
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:51,227
Yeah well...I'm not so sure anymore.

1174
01:22:56,256 --> 01:22:57,238
Me neither.

1175
01:23:00,128 --> 01:23:01,688
So now what?

1176
01:23:03,105 --> 01:23:04,598
I like you, Shane.

1177
01:23:05,664 --> 01:23:06,776
Lets face it,

1178
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:07,830
...we are Jersey.

1179
01:23:09,056 --> 01:23:10,266
Yeah, we are.

1180
01:23:13,409 --> 01:23:17,184
So...friends?

1181
01:23:21,473 --> 01:23:22,683
Friends.

1182
01:23:31,202 --> 01:23:33,176
Agents of the IRS and the FBI,

1183
01:23:33,219 --> 01:23:35,552
...raided the highly popular Studio 54...

1184
01:23:35,586 --> 01:23:37,276
So that is how my decade ended.

1185
01:23:37,602 --> 01:23:39,674
In the year and a half that
Steve was in jail,

1186
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:40,990
...things changed a lot.

1187
01:23:41,026 --> 01:23:43,447
Big corporations had taken over
the New York Club World...

1188
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:45,016
...doing what corporations do...

1189
01:23:45,443 --> 01:23:47,385
Making everything safe and boring.

1190
01:23:48,035 --> 01:23:49,660
The freedom was gone.

1191
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:52,252
I kept in touch with Julie.

1192
01:23:52,579 --> 01:23:53,507
She was doing alright,

1193
01:23:53,508 --> 01:23:54,619
she moved to Hollywood,

1194
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:56,088
and got a small part in a good film.

1195
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:59,289
I hadn't seen Greg and Anita in a while.

1196
01:23:59,524 --> 01:24:00,931
Brought back too many memories.

1197
01:24:01,252 --> 01:24:03,106
They were still together, doing fine.

1198
01:24:04,133 --> 01:24:05,987
Anita recorded a great album
with Casablanca,

1199
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:08,353
but some people thought it was too disco.

1200
01:24:10,276 --> 01:24:11,802
I had been taking business classes
at NY during the day

1201
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:14,910
and managing a restaurant
in the Village at night.

1202
01:24:15,909 --> 01:24:18,298
As far as my dad went,
it was better there too.

1203
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:21,377
I got to Jersey to see him and
my sisters about once a week.

1204
01:24:22,533 --> 01:24:25,118
When I heard about Steve's
welcome back party,

1205
01:24:25,414 --> 01:24:26,526
...I couldn't resist.

1206
01:24:39,142 --> 01:24:41,116
After getting off with just
six months probation,

1207
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:42,718
...Greg gave up dealing.

1208
01:24:43,046 --> 01:24:44,704
He got a good job in construction.

1209
01:25:28,265 --> 01:25:30,632
It is so good to see you again.

1210
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:33,248
It is great to be back.

1211
01:25:40,522 --> 01:25:42,976
I was in the Bahamas, you know.

1212
01:25:44,234 --> 01:25:46,951
On a year and a half forced vacation.

1213
01:25:49,002 --> 01:25:51,849
Don't you love my Club "Fed" tan?

1214
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,715
I want you to know,

1215
01:26:04,011 --> 01:26:07,393
only my friends are here tonight.

1216
01:26:08,332 --> 01:26:11,910
But I did put my parole officer
on the list.

1217
01:26:19,532 --> 01:26:25,544
You know, prison can be so
fucking dull at night.

1218
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:40,039
I guess, I just wanted to welcome
you all back to say...

1219
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:44,268
...this time I hope it does last forever.

1220
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:52,131
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back!

1221
01:27:02,095 --> 01:27:09,035
If you could read my mind love...
what a tale my thoughts would tell.

1222
01:27:09,072 --> 01:27:16,262
Just like an old time movie,
about a ghost from a wishing well,

1223
01:27:16,305 --> 01:27:23,887
in a castle dark, or a fortress strong
with chains upon my feet.

1224
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:31,590
You know that ghost is me. I don't know
where we went wrong,

1225
01:27:31,665 --> 01:27:36,400
but that feeling's gone and
I just can't get it back.

1226
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:50,790
If you could read my mind, yeah! Oh love
what a tale my thoughts would tell!

1227
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:57,958
Just like in a novel, when you reach
the part where the heartache comes,

1228
01:27:58,002 --> 01:28:10,027
the hero will be you!
But heros often fail.

1229
01:28:10,068 --> 01:28:17,357
Never thought I'd feel this way. And I
got to say that I just don't get it...

1230
01:28:17,396 --> 01:28:19,730
See, Steve Rubell had a dream,

1231
01:28:19,765 --> 01:28:22,098
but like all dreams, you wake up
to reality.

1232
01:28:22,707 --> 01:28:24,561
Even though Steve was just
a consultant now,

1233
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:26,286
the new owners gave him this night,

1234
01:28:26,324 --> 01:28:27,469
this one night!

1235
01:28:27,572 --> 01:28:29,098
...To bring all his friends back.

1236
01:28:29,621 --> 01:28:31,147
To do it his way.

1237
01:28:32,116 --> 01:28:34,221
For one night, we pretended
nothing had changed.

1238
01:28:34,293 --> 01:28:36,431
But in reality...

1239
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,907
The party was over.

1240
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:28,000
