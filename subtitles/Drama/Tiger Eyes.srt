1
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:14,446
I wonder what it's
like to be dead.

2
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,384
I hope it's peaceful.

3
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,753
Like you're floating.

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,424
I hope you don't keep thinking
about how you died.

5
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:27,826
And why.

6
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,997
Or... how it makes
no sense.

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:38,604
The thing about it is...
it's all so final.

8
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,264
Davey, come on,
we gotta go.

9
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,667
I can't find my flats.

10
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,675
Come on,
we're gonna be late.

11
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:53,178
- I can't find the right shoes.
- Borrow a pair of mine.

12
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,352
This kind, generous man.

13
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,423
This loving husband
and father...

14
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:07,659
who left us much too soon...

15
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,728
...would want us
to remember him

16
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,864
from every portrait
he created...

17
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,933
...every face
that he found fascinating.

18
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,694
Put some dirt on Daddy.

19
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,178
And we're going
to talk soon, okay?

20
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,147
Salad? It's very good.

21
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,315
Homemade.

22
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,691
Your aunt says it's
important to eat.

23
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,260
And what does she know?

24
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,663
She hasn't seen me
since I was five.

25
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,701
It's a nice picture of him,
don't you think?

26
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,203
Yeah.

27
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:28,440
I took it myself.
In June.

28
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,211
Right in front
of the store.

29
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,245
You think it's a good idea

30
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,513
to keep reading
about it?

31
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,950
What else am I
supposed to do?

32
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,929
I wonder if the cemetery
will get all muddy?

33
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:56,268
Like I have to put some kind of
tarp thing over the grave.

34
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,005
Or maybe it will be better
for the grass,

35
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,807
so it could
finally grow back.

36
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,552
- Why don't you just take a break?
- Come out to New Mexico.

37
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:16,555
I just hate to leave you
in this neighborhood, alone.

38
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,756
Okay, thank you.

39
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,259
We don't want you
to worry about money.

40
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,226
We're in a position to help.

41
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,662
I... I promise I'll pay it back.

42
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,599
So you just call
if you need anything.

43
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,359
Get away! Get out of here!

44
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,194
What are you
gonna do about it?

45
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,865
Do you hear me?!
Get away!

46
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,538
It's okay, they're gone.

47
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,099
Go to sleep.

48
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,077
How long will you be
in New Mexico?

49
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,013
Maybe like a week
or so.

50
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,315
Don't let her out at night...

51
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,451
Oh, and don't let her drink
out of the toilet bowl.

52
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,219
Don't worry, I'll take
good care of her.

53
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,120
I know.

54
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,996
Bye, Minka.

55
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,300
Look, a balloon!

56
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,803
Honey, get your head
back inside.

57
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:45,937
This is a moving car.

58
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,708
How could he of the world's largest
hot-air balloon festival.

59
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,543
Walter, watch the road.

60
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,546
I'd like to go up on one
of those balloons.

61
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,214
It's beautiful to watch, honey,

62
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,617
but only a fool
would actually go up in one.

63
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,920
Well, then I guess
I'm a fool.

64
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,022
If Davey's going, I'm going.

65
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,558
Nobody's going.
It's a moot point.

66
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,527
Walter, watch the road.

67
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,462
What's a moot?

68
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,663
It means it doesn't
matter, honey.

69
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,432
Because
it's not going to happen.

70
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,036
I'd like to go up...
Never come down.

71
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,375
Wow, it's really pretty here.

72
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,744
It's like
we're in another world.

73
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,013
Well you can see why Oppenheimer
chose Los Alamos

74
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,582
as the site for"Project Y."

75
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,250
What's "Project Y"?

76
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,719
It's a codename for
building the atomic bomb.

77
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,554
And Los Alamos
is the secret place

78
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,889
where the scientists worked

79
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,190
when they were developing it.

80
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,059
Bitsy works as a guide
at the museum.

81
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,428
She knows everything
about this place.

82
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,397
So, we're in a secret place,
where nobody can find us?

83
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,334
Well, it's not that much
of a secret anymore.

84
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,572
Wow, look at this house!

85
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,709
When we brought
this house,

86
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,178
we expected
to raise a family here.

87
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,714
- Didn't we, Walter?
- We did.

88
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,517
But... C'est la vie.

89
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,887
We're just so happy
you're here.

90
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,455
We want you to have
a wonderful time.

91
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,091
It's not like we're on vacation,
Aunt Bitsy.

92
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,893
I know that, Davey.

93
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,590
Jason...

94
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:22,027
You take care of a car,
it'll last for a long time.

95
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,328
Like this little beauty.

96
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,666
253,000 miles and
still going strong.

97
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:07,739
Oh!

98
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,542
Make sure you
wear that helmet.

99
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,778
And use plenty of sunscreen.
You're at 7,500 feet here.

100
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,547
Okay, Aunt Bitsy.

101
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,251
Be careful!

102
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,962
Ow!

103
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,126
Daddy?

104
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,234
Daddy?

105
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,371
Can you hear me?

106
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,575
Can you?

107
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,547
Hey!

108
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,150
You okay?

109
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,985
Who, me?

110
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,720
Yeah, you.

111
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,222
I thought you were in trouble,
the way you were calling out.

112
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,758
I'm fine.

113
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,697
What are you doing
down here?

114
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,735
Just thinking.

115
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,708
- Is there a law against that?
- No, no law against thinking.

116
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,310
Except, you're alone.

117
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,881
So, I'm alone.
You're alone too.

118
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:40,051
Yeah but, I mean, I've had
plenty of experience.

119
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,920
And who says I haven't?

120
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,957
You don't know
your ass from your armpit.

121
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,026
You mean elbow, don't you?

122
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:52,096
- Are you always so friendly?
- When I feel like it.

123
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,105
Ow.

124
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,949
You're thirsty...

125
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,919
You came into the canyon
with no water?

126
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,522
- I forgot it.
- Here.

127
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,929
Hey, easy, easy.
You'll get sick.

128
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,768
So, what's your name?

129
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,306
Uh, you can call me...
Wolf.

130
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,442
Is that a first name
or a last name?

131
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,343
Either.

132
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,677
Let's get going.

133
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,479
I gotta be somewhere
in an hour.

134
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,280
So, go.

135
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,749
You're going with me.

136
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,186
Guess again.

137
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:51,489
I'm not in the mood to be called up by
Search and Rescue later, ok?

138
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,258
I got other things to do.

139
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,747
Do you live around here?

140
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,416
Do you live around here, Wolf?

141
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,486
The more you talk the harder time you're going
to have climbing.

142
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,178
And next time,

143
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,347
bring some water
and a friend with you.

144
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,417
- It's safer that way.
- I don't have any friends here.

145
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,552
Well, maybe you should
make some.

146
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,690
So, uh...
So, what's your name?

147
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:03,494
You can call me...
Tiger.

148
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:07,031
Tiger... Is that a
first or a last?

150
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,066
Neither.

151
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,820
And over here are duplicates
of the first atomic bombs,

152
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,056
"Fat Man" and "Little Boy".

153
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:09,193
They were detonated over Japan,
in August, 1945.

154
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,729
Now, these are the only two
atomic weapons

155
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,398
ever used in warfare.

156
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,999
They represent
one of the greatest

157
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,101
scientific achievements
of all time.

158
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,772
And both bombs were designed,
fabricated, and assembled

159
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,740
right here in Los Alamos.

160
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,143
They killed a lot of people,
right?

161
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,414
Yes...
And in the next room...

162
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,182
How many people
did they kill?

163
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,585
It was something like 220,000.

164
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,054
Okay, thank you.

165
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,122
Sarah's dad got blown up
in a war

166
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,891
and now he has
a metal brain.

167
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,961
Uh, does anyone have
any questions?

168
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,997
Does Uncle Walter
make bombs?

169
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,599
Uncle Walter is involved
in Research and Design

170
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,535
for National Security.

171
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,070
Really?

172
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,172
I didn't know that.

173
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:57,875
Your Uncle Walter is a
group leader in W Division.

174
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:58,709
W?

175
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:03,214
But today's lab is equally
involved in health,

176
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:07,218
medicine, energy,
and environmental research.

177
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,826
- Mom?
- Excuse me a minute.

178
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,360
I'll take care of this.

179
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,783
Mom?

180
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,320
Mom!

181
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,966
The baby looked very much
like a mouse in every way.

182
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,368
He was only about
two inches high

183
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,205
and he had
a mouse's sharp nose...

184
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,708
I can't believe
you design weapons.

185
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,611
Yeah, it's my job, Davey.

186
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:10,581
It's your job?
That's it?

187
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,850
I do my best
to help protect us.

188
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,052
To keep us safe.

189
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,222
We all want to be safe,
don't we?

190
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,391
Don't we?

191
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:24,362
Safe?
Is that a joke?

192
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,864
Before he was many days old,

193
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,200
he was not only
looking like a mouse,

194
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,002
but acting like one too.

195
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,372
He was wearing a gray hat
and carrying a small case...

196
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:38,242
Just me!

197
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,316
Your mom loved cocoa
with marshmallows

198
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,185
when she was
a little girl.

199
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,720
She was afraid of the dark.

200
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,590
So I used to tell her
bedtime stories.

201
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,025
Sometimes, I would pretend

202
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,827
like she was my baby
instead of my sister.

203
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:04,001
Uhm, you know that
your mom is seriously stressed

204
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,504
and Walter and I don't think
she should leave

205
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,606
until she's feeling better.

206
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,508
We feel responsible for you.

207
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,476
Now, Jason is eager
to go to school,

208
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,679
so tomorrow I'm taking
him over to Aspen.

209
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,614
It's a very good
elementary school.

210
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,616
All of our schools
are very, very good.

211
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,951
And then I'm going
to take you over

212
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,352
and register
at the high school.

213
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,187
School?

214
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,526
No, I- uh, I'm not going
to school here.

215
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:31,929
Davey, please don't make this
harder than it has to be.

216
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,764
You've missed
a lot of school already,

217
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,800
and your mom
needs time to heal.

218
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,168
Well, how much time?

219
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,869
Well, as long as it takes.

220
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,405
How am I supposed
to go to school here,

221
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,341
if I don't know how
long I have to stay?

222
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,276
What does that have
to do with it?

223
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,877
Everything.

224
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,917
It's what we're doing...
Good night.

225
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:00,758
Okay, guys.

226
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,828
So today we're going
to talk about how this novel

227
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,364
changed our ideas on
traditional storytelling...

228
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,468
Now, what I want you to do

229
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,236
is think about the actions
of these characters

230
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,371
and ask yourself why.

231
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,439
Why they made
the decisions they made.

232
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,442
Come on in.

233
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:25,082
How are you doing?
What do we got?

234
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,388
We've got Davis Wexler...

235
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,758
- Everyone calls me Davey.
- Davey. Sure. Welcome.

236
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,662
So... Tony Morrison's Beloved.
That's what we're reading.

237
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,330
- Have you read it?
- No.

238
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,232
Alright, well we can get you
a copy after class.

239
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:45,703
Just do me a favor and take notes from someone who actually
knows what's going on in here.

240
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,505
I always know
what's going on.

241
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:52,543
But I think in this case
Davey should go with... Jane.

242
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,445
Jane, raise you hand for me.

243
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,082
- That would be Jane.
- Okay.

244
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,850
Alright, guys... Hi.

246
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,721
That's why my parents
named me Jane.

247
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,222
What do you mean?

248
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:08,326
You know, that whole
Davis and Davey thing.

249
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:12,363
I mean with a simple name like
Jane, nobody's ever confused.

250
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,632
I'm used to it.

251
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:23,341
...alright? We're going
to go over this next week.

252
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,676
So, where are you
from anyway?

253
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,278
Atlantic City.

254
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,247
Oh, that's in California,
right?

255
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,482
New Jersey.

256
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,686
Oh, New Jersey, uhm,

257
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,423
I guess I was thinking of,
uhm, Studio City.

258
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,992
That's near L.A.

259
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,494
Atlantic City...

260
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:49,200
That's where the Miss America
pageant started out, right?

261
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,801
Right.

262
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,274
You want some?

263
00:22:57,276 --> 00:23:00,411
My father only drinks
the best vodka.

264
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:03,614
No...
I'm good.

265
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:15,292
Ignore them... They're"stomps" -
just slightly above Neanderthal.

266
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,431
So what division
is your dad in?

267
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,565
At the lab.

268
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,704
My dad?
Um...

269
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:30,741
He's uh, away...
In India right now.

270
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,443
Oh, my dad went to India...

271
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,431
Hey, Davey.

272
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,298
Ready to go?

273
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,266
Whenever you are.

274
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,500
- Bye, Daddy.
- Alright.

275
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,668
See you later, Mr. W.

276
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,170
Stay off the beach...

277
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:01,639
- And be home by ten.
- Don't worry, Daddy.

278
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:05,075
I mean, how can I not worry?

279
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,517
What happened?
Are you okay?

280
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,586
It's... it's probably
the altitude.

281
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:16,921
I mean,
you're new here.

282
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,393
Hey, where are you going?
Don't you have class?

283
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,117
Hey!

284
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,721
Hey!

285
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,890
You new around here?

286
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:56,126
I bet you can't tell your ass
from your armpit.

287
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,563
- Hey.
- Hey.

288
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,198
It's the tiger.

289
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,000
In the flesh.

290
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,668
What were you doing
up there?

291
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,070
See those caves?

292
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:12,009
Tiwa people lived in them 800
years ago... my ancestors.

293
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,410
Your ancestors?

294
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:14,678
Yeah...

295
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,447
Now that part of my family

296
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:19,350
lives in a pueblo
thirty miles that way.

297
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,951
All I know about my family

298
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,821
is my great grandmother
lived in Atlantic City,

299
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,422
in a boarding house...
Like...

300
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,993
two thousand miles
that way.

301
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,495
I think you mean that way.

302
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:34,064
Right.
That way.

303
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:41,205
- We have a lot in common.
- I was thinking the same thing.

304
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,207
Get yourself a decent pair
of climbing shoes

305
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,576
and I'll take you up there.

306
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,545
Wait, to the caves?

307
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:57,087
You have a bright smile,
Tiger... But sad eyes.

308
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,024
You want to talk about it?

309
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:05,930
- No.
- Okay.

310
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:16,574
Maybe someday, but...
just not right now.

311
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,877
Yeah. Whenever.

312
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,222
What's wrong with Mom?

313
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,527
Oh, you know...
She's just got headaches.

314
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,063
Is she gonna die?

315
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:42,399
No, Jase.
She's not going to die.

316
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,234
How do you know?

317
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,404
Because I know.

318
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,207
What if she does?

319
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:55,112
Will we stay here with
Uncle Walter and Aunt Bitsy?

320
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,282
She's not going to die, Jason.

321
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,885
What if she does?

322
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:09,693
Then, yeah.
I guess we'd stay here.

323
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,597
See the Big Dipper?

324
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,166
I think so... I want to.

325
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,073
Everything's going
to be alright.

326
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,745
I promise... Okay?

327
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,982
It has to be.

328
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,854
This time you've bitten off
more than you can chew.

329
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,155
I can handle it.

330
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,791
You better, before it starts
to affect my work.

331
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,359
I don't have time for this.

332
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,461
Shhh! She's my sister, Walter.

333
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:47,131
This is important to me.

334
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:50,434
She needs more help
than you can give her.

335
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,670
Then I'll make sure
she gets it.

336
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:56,473
Yeah and your niece, oh man.
She's no piece of cake, either.

337
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,075
I know what I'm doing.

338
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:02,312
Well, I hope so, Bits.
I hope so.

339
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:20,898
The Society For the Preservation
Of Creative Anachronisms.

340
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,101
Uhm- I don't know what that is.

341
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,803
Oh, we celebrate
medieval life...

342
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:29,173
You know, jousting
matches and festivals.

343
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,542
Don't take this the wrong way
or anything,

344
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,144
but I'm not really
that into jousting.

345
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,580
You can- you can
give it a try.

346
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:40,918
- I'm really busy as it is.
- How so?

347
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,821
I have a lot of family
responsibilities.

348
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:44,455
Go on...

349
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:48,258
And she's volunteering
at the hospital with me.

350
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:54,732
Yeah! I'm volunteering
at the hospital.

351
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,134
I see.

352
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,503
I thought you were
the unusual type.

353
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,340
But I can see that
I was wrong.

354
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,682
I hate being around
sick people.

355
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:14,017
But, it's going to look so good
on my college application.

356
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,385
So it's worth it.

357
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,554
And if I don't
get into Harvard or Stanford,

358
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:20,591
my father is just
going to kill me.

359
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:23,060
He's head of T Division.

360
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:26,730
- T Division?
- Theoretical.

361
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,999
He's the one who thinks
brilliant thoughts.

362
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,170
You have a lot to learn about
Los Alamos, missy.

363
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:33,937
Guess so.

364
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,808
Oh,"103." That's you.
Good luck.

365
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,180
I've been waiting for you.

366
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:45,082
You've been waiting for me?

367
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,651
Any pretty girl.

368
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,588
I am just here
to refill your water.

369
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,560
Look at this.

370
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,639
My son brought it to me
from California.

371
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:13,677
- Silly, isn't it?
- Yeah.

372
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,312
Willie Ortiz.

373
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,648
Davey Wexler.

374
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,450
It's my first day
as a volunteer.

375
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:25,889
You like it?

376
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,627
- It's yours.
- No... I couldn't.

377
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,229
Besides, I don't think
we're allowed

378
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,931
to take things
from patients.

379
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,532
I'll tell you what.

380
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,937
I'm not going to be here
very long.

381
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:45,075
And when I'm gone,
I want you to have it.

382
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,684
Don't be sad.

383
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,524
I'll uh, I'll see you
next week, okay?

384
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,793
Next week.

385
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:10,467
Go do something
that will make you happy.

386
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,799
Watch me first.

387
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,841
Okay, now you try.

388
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:52,676
Use your legs for strength.

389
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,086
Next step.

390
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,924
Excellent.

391
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,995
You gotta
believe you can do it.

392
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,730
Don't be afraid.

393
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:24,141
Okay, take the next step.

394
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,681
I got you.

395
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:35,552
I knew you could do it.

396
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,499
See the black carving?

397
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:54,338
That's from their fires.
Over 800 years old.

398
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,707
Wow.

399
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,282
- A cave with a view.
- Yeah.

400
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:08,385
You can see why the
Tiwa people lived up here.

401
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:10,487
Pretty good vantage point, huh?

402
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,860
I wouldn't mind living here.

403
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:20,497
I'd bring my little brother.
And my cat.

404
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:48,358
My cat would love to
chase those.

405
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,029
When Winter comes, all the
lizards will disappear.

406
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,164
You won't see them again
until Spring.

407
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,933
Then they'll lay out
on the rocks,

408
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,769
soaking up all the sun.

409
00:33:58,771 --> 00:33:59,503
Like me.

410
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,805
You disappear in Winter?

411
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,408
I might.

412
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,149
When I was young...

413
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:18,221
I used to climb here
all the time with my father.

414
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,723
I hope it never changes.

415
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,161
Everything changes.

416
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,654
Hey, Mom.

417
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,461
Mom.

418
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,235
You have to stop taking these.

419
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:11,541
Did you hear me?!
You need to stop taking these!

420
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,910
Yeah, I have to stop
taking them.

421
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,350
Can you please get up?

422
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,788
We need you.

423
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:30,127
I'm not the person
I was before.

424
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,498
Before Adam.

425
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,674
Good... That's great.

426
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,247
She'll never
get out of bed

427
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:52,015
if you keep
bringing food to her.

428
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,418
You know, you're turning
her into a zombie.

429
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,219
Who's a zombie?

430
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:56,887
No one.

431
00:35:56,889 --> 00:36:00,724
Time to get this batch
in the oven, hmm?

432
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,592
Now, how long are we
going to bake them?

433
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,594
Eight minutes,
because of the high altitude.

434
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,931
And what are we going to set
our temperature at?

435
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,032
350.

436
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,001
Ugh, excellent.

437
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,502
I love making cookies.

438
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,840
You know, someday we
can open a cookie shack

439
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,175
in Atlantic City.

440
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,545
And we'll call it
"Jason's Cookies."

441
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:23,613
Will it be on the boardwalk?

442
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,482
Yes, it will be
on the boardwalk.

443
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:27,817
And in all the best hotels.

444
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,921
Or you can just open one
right here in Los Alamos.

445
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,557
There's no boardwalk
in Los Alamos.

446
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,264
You know you're sitting in the
same tub Oppenheimer used

447
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,465
when he live here?

448
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,136
- Oppenheimer?
- Wait...

449
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,705
As in the guy
who invented the bomb?

450
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:49,806
Yeah.

451
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,910
- He lived here?
- In this very house.

452
00:36:56,581 --> 00:37:01,451
Uhm.
Hello?

453
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,055
Yeah.

454
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,892
Oh, hi Ted.

455
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,263
Tonight?
Really?

456
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:15,599
Oh, okay.
That's perfect!

457
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,934
Okay.

458
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,303
Okay, sweet!

459
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:24,174
Eight o clock.
Alright, see ya then.

460
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:26,309
Davey, this is so exciting!

461
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,811
Who is he?

462
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:30,647
Only the most popular
guy in school.

463
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,582
Okay, we have to think up
someone for you.

464
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:38,188
How about Ruben?
Ruben's perfect.

465
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,262
What if Ted thinks
I'm pathetic?

466
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,835
I don't know,
I'm just-

467
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:54,904
I'm not really that
experienced, you know?

468
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,576
Wait, do you
have a boyfriend?

469
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:00,710
I mean did you
have a boyfriend

470
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,212
before you moved out here?

471
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,848
No.

472
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,662
...but it does warm you up.

473
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:28,638
She can be an idiot.
But I love her like a sister.

474
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,273
She's wasted.

475
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,975
Well, yeah. That too.

476
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,576
Davey!

477
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:36,613
And so am I.

478
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,888
Whoa!

479
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,970
Oh, man.

480
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,081
Isn't Ted amazing?

481
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:18,521
Hey, I'm freezing.
Let's warm up in the car.

482
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,457
You don't have a car.

483
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,061
I do now.

484
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,039
I wish we had the keys
to the ignition.

485
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,841
I could use some heat in here.

486
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:39,576
Make your own, dude.

487
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,145
- Hi.
- Hey.

488
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,081
How are you doing?

489
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,784
Can we talk?

490
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:26,890
How about a walk
on the beach?

491
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:27,824
Yeah.

492
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:38,435
Let her out, let her out!

493
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:50,146
That's... really gross.

494
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,117
Well... I gotta go.

495
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:58,855
Tell Jane I'll uh,
see her around school.

496
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:13,336
I just drank a little too much.
I'm fine, that's all.

497
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:16,506
I just needed a little,
just to loosen up, you know?

498
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,809
Those boys...
I'm just so shy!

499
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,977
Shhhh.

500
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,079
I'm sorry.

501
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,415
Wait, guys, guys!

502
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:27,116
The famous physicist.

503
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,720
Shhhh!

504
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:33,122
We couldn't be more pleased

505
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,191
that you and Jane Albertson
are friends.

506
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:37,560
You know, her mother is in
my Thursday book group.

507
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:41,431
And her father, Bud Albertson,
is a world class physicist.

508
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:42,465
Isn't that right Walter?

509
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:43,500
You bet!

510
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,336
I hear Jane's no slouch either.

511
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:49,973
Oh yeah...
She's a straight A student.

512
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,108
Maybe some of that can
rub off on you.

513
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,513
Maybe...

514
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,051
Mom!
You're up.

515
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,087
I gotta get myself together.

516
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:06,155
Well let's start
with breakfast!

517
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,190
Tea and toast?

518
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:08,892
Sure.

519
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:09,959
Mom guess what?

520
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,161
so now I can read
Captain Underpants

521
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,463
all by myself.

522
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:17,634
I can't wait for you
to read that for me.

523
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:19,168
Honey, you don't want
to be late.

524
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,870
Don't want to miss the bus.

525
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,508
There you go.
Have a good day.

526
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,681
- I... I'll see you later?
- Okay.

527
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:57,006
Come... come in.

528
00:42:57,008 --> 00:43:00,209
Meet my son.
Martin.

529
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,079
This is Davey.

530
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,186
Hello.

531
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:10,720
Hi.

532
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:17,760
Martin was a national
Merit Scholarship winner.

533
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:22,432
And he's runner-up to the
Westinghouse contest.

534
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,433
Come on, Dad.

535
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,870
He doesn't like to talk
about himself.

536
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,772
So I do it for him.

537
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,810
- Right Martin?
- Yeah.

538
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:38,881
He's going to be a
brilliant physicist.

539
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,722
He won a full scholarship
to Cal-Tech.

540
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:53,863
He's the first in the family
to go to college.

541
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:56,966
Come on, Dad.
Rest.

542
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,839
She should be on
the swim team.

543
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,708
She's got good shoulders.

544
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,580
Why didn't you say anything?

545
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:13,249
Why didn't you tell me
your father was sick?

546
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:18,421
I guess I'm just
a private person.

547
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:20,256
I am too.

548
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,103
You know when you told me
that I had sad eyes?

549
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:37,473
Yeah.

550
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:42,145
It's because my father died.

551
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:44,414
I'm sorry, Tiger.

552
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:47,884
Was he sick for a long time...
Like my dad?

553
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:48,951
No.

554
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,756
I-it happened suddenly.

555
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:58,461
Whatever happened...
It's tough either way.

556
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,829
Yeah.

557
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:17,513
Double fours...
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

558
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,949
Ventnor...
We used to live there.

559
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,585
We still live there.

560
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,723
That would be Ned.

561
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:29,459
Hey, Ned.

562
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:30,927
Come on in,
everyone's ready.

563
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,128
Oh, okay.

564
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,066
Ned, this is Bitsy's sister,
Gwen Wexler.

565
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,669
Gwen, this is my colleague,
Ned Grodzinski.

566
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:41,738
Ned plays a piano
in our group.

567
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,139
Nice to meet you.

568
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,707
I've heard a lot about you.

569
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:46,976
Oh, okay.

570
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:47,944
Gwen, you're in for a treat.

571
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:49,746
Ned plays like an angel.

572
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:50,747
You guys,
keep the doors locked.

573
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:51,748
Oh, Gwen.

574
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,649
No place safer
than the hill. Don't worry.

575
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,752
We won't be long, okay?

576
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,623
Bye.

577
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,327
Twelve.

578
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:09,065
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.

579
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,634
Boardwalk.
I'll take it.

580
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,003
Okay, so I'm building a hotel
on Boardwalk

581
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:15,571
and another one
on Park Place.

582
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:16,639
And two houses...

583
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:18,808
Wait have you
been stealing the bank,

584
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:19,842
you little creep?

585
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:22,178
Yeah, you!
Come here!

586
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,279
Get back here!

587
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,181
- No. No!
- Come over here!

588
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:30,686
I'm going to get you!

589
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:33,923
- Please, stop!
- Never!

590
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:41,597
Stop. Stop. Stop.

591
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:47,236
Jason...
do you miss Daddy?

592
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,241
Come on, Jason.
I know you do.

593
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,710
Why won't you just say it?

594
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:56,612
I mean, why won't
you ever cry?

595
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,447
Crying's for babies.
Now let me up!

596
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,583
Not until you say
you miss Daddy.

597
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:01,684
No!

598
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:03,519
Jason, say that
you miss Daddy!

599
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,488
No, you say it!

600
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,468
Jase.

601
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,903
Don't you want to go
finish the game?

602
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,638
Finish it yourself!

603
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,037
It's easy to get lost
in Santa Fe,

604
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,173
so make sure you're back
at the car by four.

605
00:47:57,175 --> 00:48:00,076
We will.

606
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,912
Look at those.

607
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,352
What do you think?
For my mom.

608
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:10,853
She'd like those.

609
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:12,521
Yeah, you should get those.

610
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:13,623
Alright.

611
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,891
We'll get these.

612
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:15,725
Here you go.

613
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,295
Thank you.

614
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,719
I'd like to get this.

615
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:46,622
I bet this is
for someone special.

616
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,658
Yeah... it is.

617
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:53,029
I have the feeling
he's a lucky guy.

618
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,466
Not really.

619
00:48:59,504 --> 00:49:01,437
Oh, God,
it smells like plastic.

620
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:04,907
Come on, dance with me.

621
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,721
Oh, here they are.
Hey, guys!

622
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:20,056
Look what I got.

623
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:20,723
Great.

624
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:21,357
Wow, look at that.

625
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,995
Give me a kiss.
Merry Christmas, young lady.

626
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,496
We really love you.

627
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:28,631
Thanks.

628
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,032
Boy, you are cold.

629
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:32,868
- Let's go inside, okay?
- I know, I'm freezing. Okay.

630
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,647
This is for you, Daddy.

631
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,386
Happy Chanukah.

632
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,502
I wish you were here.

633
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:16,038
I miss you so much.

634
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:49,171
I thought you might need
a friend tonight, Tiger.

635
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,040
I know I do.

636
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:02,051
Hey, what are you doing?

637
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:05,387
Exactly what I feel like doing.

638
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:37,686
How's the swimming team
doing this year?

639
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,890
The swim team?

640
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,693
You're a swimmer,
aren't you?

641
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:47,496
Only in the ocean.

642
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:51,734
The ocean?
You should be on the team.

643
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,705
I can tell from your shoulders
you're strong.

644
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,340
That's what counts.

645
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,545
- Are you a swimmer?
- I never learned.

646
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:04,180
You can't swim?

647
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:07,716
In New Mexico,
there's not a lot of water.

648
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,890
- What is it?
- Don't be afraid.

649
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,895
For two years I've
been fighting this.

650
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:25,100
- I'm ready.
- Don't say that.

651
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:36,512
"Life is a good adventure."

652
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:45,054
Now, it's time for
my next adventure.

653
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:52,094
Not until you learn
how to swim.

654
00:53:55,165 --> 00:54:00,102
I like a girl with
a sense of humor.

655
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,580
Isn't that the guy
from the hospital?

656
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,051
- Hey.
- Hey!

657
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:17,186
What are you doing here?

658
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:18,554
Hop in.

659
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:21,390
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

660
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,231
- Uh, Jane, this is Wolf.
- Hey.

661
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,635
Wolf?
What kind of name is that?

662
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,573
Either a first or last name.
Your choice.

663
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:43,512
So, you're just going to
leave me here?

664
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,319
Martin Ortiz?

665
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,087
It's good to see you.

666
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,221
How's your papa?

667
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:27,523
I heard he was sick.

668
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:28,791
It's pretty rough.

669
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:29,958
I'm sorry to hear that.

670
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,994
He's a good man.
Very devoted to you.

671
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:35,164
He is...
This is my friend, Tiger.

672
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:38,434
- Nice to meet you, Tiger.
- Nice to meet you guys, too.

673
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:40,369
I'm glad you could make it
to the ceremony.

674
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:42,838
Come have some food.
Say hello to everyone.

675
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,906
Sure.

676
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,112
My relatives.

677
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,781
The making
of a relation ceremony.

678
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:36,985
Something we do
from time to time.

679
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:41,690
Martin Ortiz, my son.
Come.

680
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:55,170
This ceremony... ensures...

681
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:59,041
that no one...
is left to feel alone

682
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,909
in the universe.

683
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,512
It is vital,

684
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:09,184
as we are social beings,
who depend on one another.

685
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:12,221
A person is taken in
as a relative.

686
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:16,325
Relatives are as strong
as blood.

687
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:17,793
It must be.

688
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:22,898
Because the welfare...
of the group...

689
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,902
...sometimes hinges
on one individual.

690
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:32,674
If that person...
feels disconnected...

691
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:36,778
He or she may fail.

692
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:42,951
The medicine wheel...
represents your connection...

693
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:47,990
to the four directions...
and the hoop of life.

694
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:53,562
The feather represents
your life.

695
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:59,067
Because, like your hair...
it grows.

696
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:02,871
It represents your wisdom.

697
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,541
It represents
your connection...

698
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:07,442
to the past.

699
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,065
Thanks for
bringing me tonight.

700
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:05,267
Glad you were
with me, Tiger.

701
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,942
- I'm going to miss you.
- What do you mean?

702
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,649
I'm going away.

703
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,586
Now?

704
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,622
Soon.

705
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,691
When will you be back?

706
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,370
You're late.

707
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,205
You missed dinner.

708
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,307
Who was that
in the truck?

709
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:20,509
What truck?

710
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,179
The truck
you just got out of.

711
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,814
He's a friend of mine.

712
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,115
What friend?

713
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,317
You don't know him.

714
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:31,553
Well maybe I do.

715
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:35,624
His name is Martin Ortiz.

716
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:36,892
Ortiz?

717
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:39,394
Does he to the high school?

718
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:40,896
Not anymore.

719
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:43,799
- He's a dropout?
- I didn't say that.

720
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:44,933
Okay, why don't you
just tell me about him.

721
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,568
Instead of playing
twenty questions.

722
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,870
I'm not the one playing
twenty questions.

723
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,772
You know, you can't just
accept rides

724
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:52,007
from boys, Davey.

725
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:55,477
He's not just some boy.
He goes to Cal-Tech.

726
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:57,179
He's just taking
some time off.

727
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:58,046
Cal-Tech.

728
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,581
It's an excellent school.

729
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,617
That still doesn't mean you
can get into a truck

730
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:04,119
with a boy
that we don't know.

731
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:05,721
Mom.

732
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,223
I'm sure that Bitsy
knows what's best

733
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,891
in this case, Davey.

734
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,460
Since when?

735
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:16,965
Since when does everyone here
know better than you?

736
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,801
You're turning into them.
Do you realize that?

737
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:22,904
Just afraid of everything.

738
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,272
You know a person
can get killed,

739
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:25,974
minding his own store.

740
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,642
Did you ever think about that?

741
01:02:27,644 --> 01:02:29,511
You apologize to your mother
right now.

742
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:30,846
Walter, she didn't mean it.

743
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:33,048
Did you hear me?

744
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,084
Did you hear me?!

745
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,687
(GLASS SHATTERS)

746
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:40,889
Your children are totally
out of control, Gwen.

747
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:42,724
Oh, really?
Are they still my children?

748
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:46,895
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, all of you!

749
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:10,085
 Anytime
you're feeling lonely 

750
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:15,056
 Anytime
you're feeling blue 

751
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:16,258
Hey.

752
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,361
You're late.

753
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:21,229
I thought you weren't
even coming.

754
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:23,665
Well here I am,
ready for the audition.

755
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,035
Have you been drinking?

756
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,370
No...

757
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:32,307
Okay just a teensy, weeny bit.
Just like a little.

758
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,242
I'm fine, Davey.
I'm fine.

759
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:36,344
You can't tryout drunk.

760
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:37,913
Well then
I'm not going to tryout,

761
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:40,382
because I'm sure as hell
not going up there sober.

762
01:03:40,384 --> 01:03:42,284
Then don't tryout.

763
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:49,257
That was great, Joel.

764
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:51,393
Thank you so much
for coming.

765
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:54,796
That was fabulous.
Thanks again.

766
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:56,598
Jane Albertson?

767
01:03:57,401 --> 01:04:00,368
Just tell her you
changed your mind.

768
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,703
Jane?

769
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:02,838
Here. I'm here.

770
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,575
Don't do this.

771
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:18,320
Uhm... I want to do
uh, "Anytime", right?

773
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:19,988
Yes, right.

774
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,556
You okay there?

775
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:24,659
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

776
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:25,760
Okay.

777
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,129
Ready?

778
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,936
 Anytime I'm feeling lonely

779
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:42,344
 Anytime I'm feeling blue

780
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:45,480
You could have had me...
for a friend...

781
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:48,149
and you chose her.

782
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,584
I hope you're happy
with your choice.

783
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:52,387
Thank you so much,
Jane, for coming. Thank you.

784
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,488
Yeah.

785
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,656
Are you okay?

786
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,992
Yeah, I'm fine.

787
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,531
I feel like I'm
going to throw up.

788
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,638
Davey Wexler?

789
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,809
Go for it, Davey.

790
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:18,079
I can't believe you
signed me up.

791
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,382
Davey Wexler.

792
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,452
Here.

793
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,822
- Hello.
- Hi.

794
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:28,490
Woo!

795
01:05:28,492 --> 01:05:30,525
Go for it, Davey.

796
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:33,094
Shhh. Hush.

797
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,963
Anytime you're ready.

798
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:44,940
 Anytime
you're feeling lonely 

799
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:49,144
 Anytime
you're feeling blue 

800
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:54,883
 Anytime
you feel downhearted 

801
01:05:55,685 --> 01:06:00,455
 That will prove
your love for me is true 

802
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:05,894
That was really good.
I have the music right here.

803
01:06:05,896 --> 01:06:07,595
So why don't I give it to you...

804
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:10,398
You rehearse it and
Monday we'll work it through.

805
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,367
Okay.
Thank you.

806
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:14,035
Okay, see you Monday.

807
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,511
Jane.

808
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,882
Jane, get up.
Come on.

809
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:30,085
Did I
make a fool of myself?

810
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,923
Yes, you did.
Come on.

811
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:44,933
Look, you need help.

812
01:06:44,935 --> 01:06:47,602
There's nothing
wrong with me.

813
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,205
Look, I'm trying to
be your friend,

814
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:53,274
so don't play this game
with me.

815
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:57,212
- And what game is that?
- It's called denial.

816
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:02,183
You're a great one to
talk about denial.

817
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:04,319
You...

818
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:07,655
told me your father
is in India.

819
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,960
But that's not what your
aunt told my mother.

820
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,429
You really think

821
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:17,599
you're the only one
with all the problems?

822
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:21,002
If you think my life
is just so easy,

823
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:22,103
you're wrong.

824
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,095
Hey, it's a school night.
You should be studying.

825
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,703
I was watching that.

826
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,339
You know...

827
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:04,212
with a little effort you could
be getting all A's and B's.

828
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:05,180
You know,
you're really not

829
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:07,148
working up to your
full potential.

830
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,617
How do you know?

831
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:12,053
You don't know
anything about me.

832
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:15,490
Well I know that you have to
think about your future.

833
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:18,093
It's never too early
to have goals.

834
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:19,194
I have goals.

835
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:23,431
Well I hope they include
improving your grades.

836
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:26,034
It's what you learn that counts.

837
01:08:26,036 --> 01:08:27,902
Not what kind of grades
you get.

838
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:29,404
Where did you learn that?

839
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:31,239
From my father.

840
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,942
Yeah I should have guessed.

841
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,178
You want to end up like him?

842
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:42,417
No education.
Running a sandwich shop?

843
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:44,419
It's a wasted life.

844
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:48,790
How dare you say that
my father had a wasted life.

845
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:51,092
You don't know anything.

846
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:53,061
He was a better man
than you.

847
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:54,796
A better man than you
could ever be.

848
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,564
If your father had been
a better man,

849
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:58,933
your mother wouldn't be
where she is now.

850
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:00,502
That's so not true.

851
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:03,371
That's another example
of a wasted life.

852
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:07,142
Pregnant in high school.
Destitude at thirty-three.

853
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,077
Shut up, asshole!

854
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,185
I hate you.

855
01:09:57,393 --> 01:10:02,096
And...

856
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:08,937
"When the lizards run".

857
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:16,878
Does that mean something
to you?

858
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:22,083
Yeah... it does.

859
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:50,511
Mr. Ortiz...

860
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,325
Mr. Ortiz?

861
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:08,463
Last night...
His son was with him.

862
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,500
He asked me
to give you this.

863
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:56,711
Hey, Davey.

864
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:57,578
How are you doing?

865
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,513
Ready to go?

866
01:11:58,515 --> 01:11:59,447
Whenever you are.

867
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:00,348
See you later, Mr. W.

868
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,183
Alright, stay off the beach.

869
01:12:02,185 --> 01:12:06,387
 Every time
we say goodbye 

870
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:10,325
 I wonder why a little

871
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:22,570
Daddy.

872
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,308
I need you.

873
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:28,302
Thanks, Ruben.

874
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:31,172
Break a leg, okay?

875
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,708
And next up is Davey Wexler,

876
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,710
singing "Anytime."

877
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,346
Change of plans.

878
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:10,812
 Every time we say goodbye
I die a little 

879
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:25,193
 Every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little 

880
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:40,475
 Why the gods above me
Who must be in the know 

881
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:54,722
 Think so little of me
They allow you to go 

882
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:59,961
 When you're near

883
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:09,737
 There's such an air
of spring... about it 

884
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:17,445
 I can hear a Lark
somewhere 

885
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:25,520
 begin to sing...
about it 

886
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:32,660
 There's no love song finer

887
01:15:32,662 --> 01:15:41,235
 But how strange the change
From major to minor 

888
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:48,442
 Every time we say...  

889
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,376
What the hell?

890
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:35,256
Daddy?

891
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:39,360
Daddy!

892
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:39,927
Daddy!

893
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,028
Help me.

894
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:45,633
Daddy! Daddy!
Oh, my god. Daddy!

895
01:16:45,635 --> 01:16:46,801
Help me, Davey.

896
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:48,369
I'm trying.

897
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:51,939
Help! Somebody help!

898
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:57,912
Help!
Daddy!

899
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:02,450
Daddy!
Help! Help!

900
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,414
There was a robbery.

901
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:38,519
He was shot in the chest
three times for 67 dollars.

902
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,325
So that's how it was...

903
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,528
I tried to help but...

904
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:54,635
I couldn't.
I just wish I knew what to do.

905
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,209
Remember that you're alive.

906
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:05,579
He'd want you to live.

907
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:17,291
Your life...

908
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:22,930
All the past...
And all the future.

909
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:50,551
In the summer,

910
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:52,720
this was the home
of the Tiwa people.

911
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:54,688
Over 800 years ago.

912
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:57,992
In the winter they would
go down and live in the caves.

913
01:19:57,994 --> 01:19:59,059
Wow.

914
01:19:59,061 --> 01:20:01,495
You know a lot about this place,
don't you?

915
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:04,131
I had a good teacher.

916
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:08,903
It's been a long time since
we've done something,

917
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:10,437
just the two of us.

918
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:11,772
I know.

919
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,277
You know, up until now
I've uhm...

920
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,215
I've been afraid
to be alone with you.

921
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,185
Afraid of me?

922
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:29,089
I was afraid that you would want
to talk about Daddy.

923
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:31,692
And what happened
that night.

924
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:35,563
And I was afraid that it was
going to be too painful for me.

925
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,770
I did want to talk about it.

926
01:20:42,772 --> 01:20:46,006
I know. I'm so sorry.

927
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:51,011
I'm ready
to talk now, okay?

928
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:57,017
I miss him.
I miss him so much.

929
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:59,587
I know, so do I.

930
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:03,724
What are we going
to do, Mom?

931
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:07,461
I'm going to figure that out.

932
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:08,529
It's a new recipe.

933
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:11,031
But I substituted olive oil
for canola,

934
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:14,034
because canola just
doesn't agree with Walter.

935
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,569
I gotta remember that.

936
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:19,607
Well, I have some news.

937
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:20,875
We want you to know,

938
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:22,977
we think Ned Grodzinski
is a wonderful man,

939
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:24,511
and we couldn't be
happier for you.

940
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:25,279
Wait, what?

941
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:28,048
He's asked your mother
to marry him.

942
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,417
Ned is a good man,
with a bright future.

943
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:32,086
But I said no.

944
01:21:32,088 --> 01:21:33,187
You said no?

945
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:34,655
Come on, Bits,
it's way too soon.

946
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:36,924
He's a good friend,
but I'm not in love with him.

947
01:21:36,926 --> 01:21:38,158
Love?

948
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,661
You're not a teenager
this time, Gwen.

949
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:42,296
Don't expect love
to feel the way it did

950
01:21:42,298 --> 01:21:44,131
when you were seventeen.

951
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,500
Well, what I was going to say

952
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:48,936
is that it's time for us
to make a move.

953
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:50,738
What do y-
What kind of move?

954
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:55,242
It's time for us
to go home.

955
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,545
You can't!

956
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:00,381
I mean the children
are settled here.

957
01:22:00,383 --> 01:22:01,849
And you guys
have been wonderful.

958
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:03,284
I wouldn't have
been able to manage

959
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:05,953
without you, but it's time
for us to go back home

960
01:22:05,955 --> 01:22:07,521
and start our
new life as a family.

961
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:08,889
We can help you find
a place of your own

962
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:10,491
right here, in Los Alamos.

963
01:22:10,493 --> 01:22:11,792
Try to understand.

964
01:22:11,794 --> 01:22:15,262
You should be the one
to try to understand.

965
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,645
I don't know what your mother
is trying to prove.

966
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:36,550
I don't know why she feels
she has to do this.

967
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:45,159
What does that mean?

968
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:49,330
It means
"Life is a good adventure."

969
01:22:56,372 --> 01:23:00,474
Sometimes it is,
and sometimes it isn't.

970
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:08,082
I admire your courage, Davey.

971
01:23:08,084 --> 01:23:09,850
I really do.

972
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,018
Goodbye, Daddy.

973
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:28,028
that I'm not going to think
about you anymore.

974
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:32,499
This doesn't mean t
hat I'm not gonna...

975
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:34,535
give up that night.

976
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:40,074
Because that night happened

977
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:44,478
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

978
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:57,024
I love you.

979
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,761
I'll always love you.

980
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:18,245
Goodbye.

981
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:55,082
You okay?

982
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,217
Yeah.

983
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:02,823
This is for you.

984
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:04,725
What is it?

985
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:07,094
Open it.

986
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,868
A tiger's eye.

987
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:16,837
For my tiger.

988
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:27,447
Thank you.

989
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,157
Look.
