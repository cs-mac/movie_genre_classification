we were talking about
John Philip Sousa,

824
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:02,509
great march composer
around the turn
of the century?

825
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:06,274
He was a very
famous man,

826
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:09,444
but he had a huge thing
about recorded music.

827
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,283
He would never
allow his music
to be recorded.

Even when Thomas Edison
came to him

00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:17,118
with his brand-new
invention, the phonograph.

830
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:20,393
But Edison didn't care.
He went ahead
and did it anyhow.

831
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:24,560
Secretly he recorded
his marching band

<i>RONNlE</i>/ <i>l never</i>
<i>met my grandfather.</i>

1108
01:27:27,656 --> 01:27:29,886
<i>He died when</i>
<i>l was just a baby.</i>

1109
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:35,658
But when l hear
about him and Hachi,
l feel like l know him.

1110
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:39,324
They taught me
the meaning of loyalty,

1111
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:42,962
that you should
never forget anyone
that you've loved.

1112
01:27:43,772 --> 01:27:47,208
And that's why
Hachi will forever
be my hero.

1113
01:27:58,286 --> 01:28:00,015
Oh, my God,
look how cute he is!
Hi, boy.

1114
01:28:00,088 --> 01:28:01,715
He drives me crazy.

1115
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,052
Oh, he's happy
to see somebody.

1116
01:28:03,124 --> 01:28:04,182
l know.

1117
01:28:06,328 --> 01:28:07,886
Can you walk?

1118
01:28:11,566 --> 01:28:13,363
Come on, Hachi.
Let's go.

1119
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:18,338
Come on.

1120
01:28:20,442 --> 01:28:22,103
Hey, here boy.
